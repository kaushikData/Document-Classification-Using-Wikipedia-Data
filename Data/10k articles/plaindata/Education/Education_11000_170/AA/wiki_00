The school is located in Miramar in Puerto Rico's capital city of San Juan. Students, teachers and alumni commonly refer to their school as Perpetuo. The school has historically been known to be a very prestigious school, traditionally educating young men and women who are to become influential leaders of Puerto Rican society. The school is featured prominently in Magali Garcia Ramis's novel \"Felices Dias Tio Sergio\".\n\nMany graduates attend top-ranked colleges and universities. Perpetuo provides academic instruction in Math, Sciences, History, English, Spanish, and Religion. It also provides a variety of athletic intercollegiate teams for its students as well as academic teams, specifically its Math, Model UN, Forensics, High School Choir, Drama Club and History teams. Perpetuo has 42 organized clubs, a varsity program in ten sports, four student publications and a yearbook, a Student Council, and an Honor Society for qualified students. It also offers membership for a Jr. Honor Society and an Honor Academy.\n\nStudents participate in a wide range of extracurricular activities ranging from Drama Club to community service. Every year, a handful of students have the opportunity to participate in a community service trip to Guatemala, Peru, and Honduras. Students spend two weeks with nuns in villages helping build houses, schools and also sharing time with local children as part of a community development program. Also, rising juniors have the opportunity to participate in a European Educational Trip coordinated by school officials.\n\nThe goal of the Academia del Perpetuo Socorro is the complete development of the student - spiritually, mentally, morally, socially, culturally, and physically in order to live a full life and to prepare for his/her final goal - union with God. To this end, the school works to create a Catholic academic community in which faith, knowledge, and recreation are shared in a spirit of freedom, love, and creativity. The school, however, does not emphasize religion over other subjects, accepts students of all faiths and does not impose religious requirements such as baptism, confirmation or church attendance as a condition for continued attendance.\n\nThe school provides one of the most encompassing and through education experiences available to Puerto Rican students. It is known to be the stepping stone many future leaders of Puerto Rican society have prior to being educated in elite American institutions and becoming influential professionals.\n\n\"Esto Perpetua\" translated as \"This Endures\" stressing how the Catholic values and formal academic education learned at this school, symbolized in the school seal by the oil lamp over the open book, (as in burning the midnight oil) are to permeate individuals and society forever.\nIn short this motto is a reference to how the school's positive influence is eternal.\n"}

It is based on a 0-10 point scale, similar to the US 1.0-4.0 scale.\n\nTypically when an American educational institution requests a grade-point average (GPA) calculated on the 4 point scale, the student will be expected to do a direct mathematical conversion, so 10 becomes 4.0, 7.5 becomes 3.0, etc. This makes sense from a practical standpoint. In reality, however, it is completely inaccurate.\n\nIn the Vietnamese system, a score of ten is rarely given. In contrast, a 4.0 in a U.S. classroom is not unusual, nor is someone with a 4.0 GPA overall. According to the Research Center for Vocational, Technical and Higher Education under the Vietnamese Ministry of Education, someone with a 7.5 GPA will probably be in the top 10-15% of his or her class.\n\nThe practice of most Vietnamese colleges is not to provide official transcripts to other universities on behalf of their students. Students can request a signed and stamped original transcript from their school, and then have copies certified with a red stamp at a government office. Translation services are also available at such offices.\n\nSource: EducationUSA Vietnam, U.S. Embassy in Hanoi.\n\nIn practice, most U.S. universities used a standardized acceptance of A, B, C, D's only. Thus any A+'s, B+, C+ will be down-convert to A, B, C respectively.\n\nStandardized Table to Convert University GPAs\n\nSome universities in Vietnam notes standardized credit hours, which can translate directly over to the U.S. system. Some instead notes class hours of 15, 30, 45, 60 ... etc. which needs to be converted into credit hours by dividing class hours by 15. Thus a 15-hour class is equivalent to 1 credit hours, a 45-hour class is equivalent to 3 credit hours.\n\nMost universities convert GPAs class by class. Each class is evaluated for credit hours equivalent. Each class grade point is evaluated in its native grade point, then converted to A, B, C, D, F. Then convert the individual class grade to the 4.0 system. Next, multiply each class grade point by the number of credit hours for the respective class. Finally, total up the points, and divide by the total number credit hours to arrive at the final GPA.\n\nThe original article can be found at the U.S. Embassy's Education USA office located at: 1st Floor, Rose Garden Tower, 170 Ngoc Khanh St., Hanoi, Vietnam\n\nhttps://photos.state.gov/libraries/vietnam/8621/pdf-forms/VN-Grading-System.pdf\n\nHigh schools seem to use a slightly modified GPA system, with higher criteria to receive the equivalent grading letter scale. High school classes are standardized in most Vietnamese public schools, with the respective classes and Grade Point tables listed below.\n"}

He opened the Academy Bookshop in Holland Street, Kensington in 1964 and moved into publishing as Academy Editions in 1968. From then until 1990, when he sold the company to VCH Germany (now part of John Wiley) he published more than a thousand titles mainly on art, architecture and the decorative arts. He was the first to publish (in USA - Rizzoli 'and latter St. Martin's Press) many international architects in the 'Architectural Monographs No...' series, which included Alvar Aalto (No 4), Michael Graves (No 5), Edwin Lutyens (No 6), John Soane (No 8), Terry Farrell (No 9), Richard Rogers (No 10), Mies van der Rohe (No 11), Hassan Fathy (No 13), Tadao Ando (No 14), Daniel Libeskind (No 16), etc.; and Victor Arwas’s \"Art Deco\", first published in 1980 remains the standard work on the subject.\n\nPapadakis was born in Nicosia, Cyprus on 17 June 1938 and relocated to London in 1956. He obtained a DIC from Imperial College and a PhD from Brunel University. In 1964 he bought a house in Holland Street, Kensington without realising that the shop (then a dry cleaners) on the ground floor could not be used for residential purposes. He decided to open a bookshop. The Academy Bookshop began as a general bookshop. His first publications were finely bound limited editions of other publishers’ books but he soon decided that he would prefer to make his own and began in 1967 with a large format paperback of Aubrey Beardsley’s prints, an ideal title to attract the customers of Biba, who had recently opened her shop just round the corner in Kensington Church Street. The Beardsley book was still in print when Academy was sold in 1990.\n\nIn 1971 Papadakis expanded his fast-growing business with the acquisition of the Tiranti publishing company and the London Art Bookshop. He moved the shop to No. 8 Holland Street, just opposite the Academy Bookshop and set about expanding the combined Academy/Tiranti list. Early publications included Jim Burns’s \"Arthropods\", Roger Bilcliffe’s \"Charles Rennie Mackintosh\", Rudofsky’s \"Architecture without Architects\", Reyner Banham’s \"Design by Choice\", \"Alphonse Mucha, Complete Graphic Works\", and Wittkower’s \"Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism\".\n\nIn 1975 Papadakis bought the financially troubled \"Architectural Design\" magazine. This created some controversy because of his non-architectural background and his unwillingness to give his unconditional support to one particular architectural style. The controversy increased with the publication of Charles Jencks’s \"The Language of Post-Modern Architecture\" in 1977, which was in its sixth edition by the time he sold Academy in 1990.\n\nBoth \"Architectural Design\" and Academy Editions continued to publish Post-Modern, Classical and Deconstructivist projects throughout the 1980s while Papadakis himself actively fostered the pluralist debate through seminars, conferences and exhibitions at the Polytechnic of Central London, the Architectural Association, the RIBA, the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt, and through his Academy Forums at the Tate Gallery and the Royal Academy of Arts, where he also founded the annual Architecture Lecture.\n\nIn 1990, Papadakis sold what was by now the Academy Group Ltd. with \"Architectural Design\" and the journals he had founded: \"Architectural Monographs\", \"Art and Design\" and the \"Journal of Philosophy and the Visual Arts\". He left the group at the end of 1992 and was banned by a non-competition clause from publishing for five years.\n\nIn 1997, Papadakis founded a new publishing house, Papadakis Publisher, with his daughter Alexandra. In addition to books on architecture and the decorative arts the company broadened its scope to include books on natural science, including the acclaimed series \"Pollen\", \"Seeds\" and \"Fruit\" in association with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, leading to his election as a Fellow of the Linnean Society. \"Pollen\" and \"Seeds\" were awarded a joint gold medal by the American Independent Publishers’ Association in 2006 as Outstanding Books of the Year, and his first science book \"Why the Lion Grew its Mane\" was long-listed by the Royal Society in 2007.\n\nAs Papadakis’s business ventures were increasingly successful, he purchased several properties for restoration, including the medieval Kilbees Farm in Winkfield, Berkshire and Dauntsey Park House in Wiltshire, although the latter project ended in 2005 when planning permission was refused. \nIn 1987 Papadakis bought Church Island in the Thames and commissioned Dr. Basil Al Bayati, an architect whose books 'Architect' and 'Recent Works' he had published, to design a house for him.\n“For his luxury mansion on his Greek-island-in-the-Thames, the great man chose not Michael Graves, one of the deconstructivists or even CZWG, but pragmatic classicist Basil Al Bayati, whom he instructed to design a country house in the English turn-of-the-century manner.” The plan of the house is based on multiple units of structural geometrical forms and utilises extensive brickwork in a postmodern, art & craft style. It was “designed in a vernacular manner, using building materials similar to those traditionally used in the area.”\n\nIn 1988, Church Island House was exhibited at the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt in an exhibition titled The Architecture of Pluralism that included work by James Gowan, Terry Farrell, Charles Jencks and some twenty other internationally recognised architects.\n\nIn 2007 he purchased Monkey Island Hotel in Bray, Berkshire but died a few months afterwards.\n\n"}

It was more popular in the 1970s than it is now. It is heavily used in military training. The prime use is to evaluate progress and weaknesses within the team involved.\n\nAssault courses are used in military training to increase fitness, to demonstrate techniques that can be used for crossing very rough terrain, and to increase teamwork and self-confidence.\n\nOften military assault courses will be standardised, and will have, for example (in the UK), a six-foot and a ten-foot wall, a climbing net, some type of bar to climb over, and a high rope or net that must be crossed (these being or representing the most likely difficult terrain that a soldier will come across). The standardisation means that every course will be to the same quality, though it also means that there will be certain parts that may be familiar if practised.\n\nHowever, they have different purposes. For example, they can be short (less than a minute) with a range on the end (e.g. Junior Leaders, Folkestone), or long (five minutes) as at Thetford. This is partially because of space restraints and training objectives. The short one can be run as an individual course and a warmup for the range. The long Thetford course is more of an exercise in endurance and teamwork.\n\nThe term \"trim trail\" has more recently been applied to a series of wooden exercise stations, scattered in parkland or other locations beside a jogging or walking trail, which can be used to develop balance, strength and coordination. They are suitable for both adults and children, and the individual stations have been scientifically designed to provide a range of exercise. Most have simple instructions attached to them, and the stations include balance beams, sit-up bars, chin-up bars, parallel bars, and more challenging stations such as pole climbs and ladder walks. Bristol City Council have now installed trim trails in six parks, ranging in complexity from Withywood Park, which has a single station, to Victoria Park, which has nine. Funding for the trim trail at Hollingworth Lake, in Greater Manchester, which was the idea of the Friends of Hollingworth Lake and opened in August 2010, was provided by the Big Lottery Community Spaces fund.\n\n"}

It was bought c. 1590 by Roger Bindlosse.\n\nThe tower was extended to a manor house by Roger in the early 1590s before he died in 1595. His son Robert inherited and was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1615. Robert's son Sir Francis Bindlosse predeceased him and so the estate passed to Francis's eldest son, Robert, who was created a baronet in 1641 and was elected MP for Lancashire in 1660. He also served twice as High Sheriff. He built a private Oratory on the estate. On his death in 1688 with no male heir the baronetcy became extinct and the estate passed to his only daughter, Cecilia, who had married William Standish. On her death there were again no male heirs and the estate passed to a daughter who had married Thomas Strickland of the Sizergh family. The Scottish soldier Charlie MacDougal is believed to have died in the grounds in 1745 following the infighting between the Scots returning from England with Bonnie Prince Charlie. The Stricklands sold the Hall in 1854 for £28,000 to Col.

The approaches overlap with those in psychometrics.\nEducational measurement is the assigning of numerals to traits such as achievement, interest, attitudes, aptitudes, intelligence and performance. \n\nThe aim of theory and practice in educational measurement is typically to measure abilities and levels of attainment by students in areas such as reading, writing, mathematics, science and so forth. Traditionally, attention focuses on whether assessments are reliable and valid. In practice, educational measurement is largely concerned with the analysis of data from educational assessments or tests. Typically, this means using total scores on assessments, whether they are multiple choice or open-ended and marked using marking rubrics or guides.\n\nIn technical terms, the pattern of scores by individual students to individual items is used to infer so-called scale locations of students, the \"measurements\". This process is one form of scaling. Essentially, higher total scores give higher scale locations, consistent with the traditional and everyday use of total scores. If certain theory is used, though, there is not a strict correspondence between the ordering of total scores and the ordering of scale locations. The Rasch model provides a strict correspondence provided all students attempt the same test items, or their performances are marked using the same marking rubrics.\n\nIn terms of the broad body of purely mathematical theory drawn on, there is substantial overlap between educational measurement and psychometrics. However, certain approaches considered to be a part of psychometrics, including Classical test theory, Item Response Theory and the Rasch model, were originally developed more specifically for the analysis of data from educational assessments.\n\nOne of the aims of applying theory and techniques in educational measurement is to try to place the results of different tests administered to different groups of students on a single or common scale through processes known as test equating. The rationale is that because different assessments usually have different difficulties, the total scores cannot be directly compared. The aim of trying to place results on a common scale is to allow comparison of the scale locations inferred from the totals via scaling processes.\n\n"}

Since 1979 he has been the Mayor of Marinaleda and since 2008 deputy for United Left (UL) in the Parliament of Andalusia. He is also leader of the party Collective for the Unity of Workers - Andalusian Left Bloc (CUT-BAI), part of UF and the rural workers's union Andalusian Workers Union.\n\nSánchez Gordillo has a long history of participating in militant action for the benefit of Spanish working class. He helped to transform Marinaleda from a town blighted by rural poverty into what Sánchez Gordillo himself and \"The Guardian\" have described as a \"communist utopia\", where since the early 1990s there has been no need for mortgages—the town has \"virtually full employment, communally owned land and wage equality\". In August 2012 the town had only 5% unemployment, mostly recent arrivals and economic migrants, contrasting with the rest of Spain where unemployment is at 25%, and at 34% in Andalusia.\n\nIn mid August 2012, Sánchez Gordillo attracted considerable media attention both within Spain and internationally due to his role in raids on supermarkets in nearby towns, Seville and Cádiz, where food was stolen and handed out to poor families and to Food banks. The items stolen were part of a list chiefly made of rice, sugar, pasta, milk, olive oil and flour. Sánchez Gordillo did not personally remove food, but was outside in the car parks while members of his union conducted the raids. Several of these members have been arrested and later released, though Sánchez Gordillo himself has immunity from prosecution. Sánchez Gordillo has however said he is happy to waive his immunity and go to jail for his cause, in fact he said he expected to be jailed in order to make his message spread further. English speaking media have widely reported that Sánchez Gordillo is seen as a hero and a \"national celebrity\" within Spain, comparing him to Robin Hood. A dissenting voice came from Jonathan Blitzer of the \"New York Times\", who suggested he may fail to live up to the hype and be more like a Don Quixote.\nSánchez Gordillo has also been called a modern Robin Hood and \"the revolutionary of Andalusia\" by several Spanish newspapers, including the center-left El País. Gordillo has been criticised by several Spanish citizens and officials, including Alfonso Alonso, a spokesman for the governing People's Party in Spain's national parliament, who said \"One can’t be Robin Hood and at the same time earning a salary as the sheriff of Nottingham\".\n\nOn 16 August, Gordillo set off on a three-week march to Madrid; on the way he planned to occupy banks and to persuade local authorities to default on their debts and refuse to implement austerity. So far this has included a brief occupation of a Unicaja branch in Mancha Real.\n\nIn November 2013 a Spanish court sentenced Sánchez Gordillo and four others to seven months in prison for occupying unused military land they wanted to be loaned to farmers hard hit by the economic crisis.\n\n\n"}

Her parents were the merchant Christian Joseph Hubert Heynen (born in 1837) and Maria Elisabeth Elise Dumont (born 1836 or 1837). By 1879, Louise was working as a seamstress, following her father's second bankruptcy. Louise Dumont auditioned in 1882 at the Residenz Theater in Berlin, where she received her first role. As her artist's name she chose her mother's maiden name, Dumont. In 1888, she won an engagement at the Royal Court Theatre in Stuttgart, where she became acquainted with and a friend of Queen Charlotte. In 1898 Dumont left Stuttgart in order to join the Deutsches Theatre in Berlin, where she achieved her greatest successes, especially as a performer of pieces by Henrik Ibsen.\n\nIn 1903, she met Gustav Lindemann. As it was not possible for them to establish a theatre in Berlin because of local court intrigues, they then attempted to do so in Darmstadt, also without success. They finally succeeded in Düsseldorf, where Louise Dumont and Gustav Lindemann founded the Schauspielhaus Düsseldorf on 16 June 1904, as a direct competitor to the municipal theatre. Louise Dumont and Gustav Lindemann both contributed financially to the project, as did ten members of prestigious families like the Poensgens and the Luegs. The theatre opened on October 28, 1905, to which a theatre academy was later added. The academy trained a number of actors who significantly influenced German theatre life, such as Gustaf Gründgens, Peter Esser, Adolf Dell, Paul Henckels, Paul Kemp, Wolfgang Langhoff, Maria Alex and Henry Orthmayer.\n\nIn 1907, Louise Dumont married Gustav Lindemann. They separated in the 1920s, after which Dumont was attached to a number of young actresses, including Fita Benkhoff, Hanni Hoessrich and Luise Rainer. It has been presumed that she was bisexual.\n\nLouise Dumont is considered the 20th century successor to Friederike Caroline Neuber. She exerted less of a mimic-erotic fascination than a strong, convincing and defining gravity, which she understood as performing faithful service to the words of the author.\nDumont died in 1932 in Düsseldorf and was buried in the local cemetery. Her grave is decorated with a sculpture by Ernst Barlach. Her husband donated in her memory a necklace with a pearl-encircled topas that she had received as a present from Queen Charlotte of Württemberg, to be awarded to outstanding actresses during their lifetime. In 1976 she was featured on a postage stamp issued by the Deutsche Bundespost. The Louise-Dumont-Straße in Düsseldorf-Pempelfort was named after her.\n\n\n"}

In it had a population of .\n\nThe construction of a field school began in 1962, inspired by David Ben-Gurion's vision of developing a thriving Jewish culture in the arid Negev. The Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, affiliated with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, the Ben Gurion Heritage Institute, and a high school emphasizing environmental studies, are now located there. Ben-Gurion and his wife Paula Ben-Gurion are buried on the cliff overlooking the Zin valley.\n\nThe Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research has developed a solar energy research program focusing on how extremes of heat and cold in the desert can be mitigated through efficient storage of heat during the day for release at night.\n\nAn adobe house was built with rational fenestration, small windows in the northern side and heat collecting concrete prisms in the windows of the south facing wall. The prisms are situated in the rooms. They absorb heat during the day and can be rotated to allow the heat to discharge into the rooms at night. The \"chimney\" is part of an evaporative cooling system that maintains the temperature of the house during the day at bearable levels.\n\nA double skin greenhouse uses copper sulfate solution as a heat screen during the day. The liquid is pumped between the two skins, protects the interior from ultraviolet rays and collects heat. At night the liquid is recirculated returning the heat to the greenhouse.\n\nDavid Faiman of the Solar Center has made advancements in the realm of concentrator photovoltaics CPV. Faiman has produced a CPV unit capable of producing energy at a factor of up to a thousand more than conventional units.\n\nResearchers at Midreshet Ben-Gurion have made breakthroughs in agriculture and biotechnology relevant to drylands and sustainable agriculture.

{"id": "43699289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43699289", "title": "Outreachy", "text": "Outreachy\n\nOutreachy (previously the Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program for Women) is a program that organizes three-month paid internships with free and open-source software projects for people who are typically underrepresented in those projects. The program is organized by the Software Freedom Conservancy and was formerly organized by The GNOME Project and the GNOME Foundation.\n\nIt is open to cisgender and transgender women, people of other gender identities that are minorities in open source (including transgender men and genderqueer people), and people of any gender in the United States who have racial/ethnic identities underrepresented in the US technology industry (Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander). Participants can be of any background and any age older than 18. Internships can focus on programming, design, documentation, marketing, or other kinds of contributions.\n\nThe program began in 2006 with a round of internships for women working on the GNOME desktop environment (which primarily runs on Linux), and it resumed in 2010 with internships twice a year, adding projects from other organizations starting in 2012. As of 2014, these rounds of internships have had up to 16 participating organizations, including Mozilla and the Wikimedia Foundation. Funding comes from the GNOME Foundation, Google, organizations participating in the internships, and other software companies.\n\nThe goal of Outreachy is to \"create a positive feedback loop\" that supports more women participating in free and open-source software, since contributors to free and open-source projects have mostly been men (see also Women in Libre software communities). The program is similar to Google Summer of Code, also an internship in free and open-source software, but unlike Google Summer of Code it is not limited to students or developers. It is intended to be compatible with student schedules, with mid-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the northern hemisphere, and late-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe program began with inviting women participants, and it grew to include \"anyone who was assigned female at birth and anyone who identifies as a woman, genderqueer, genderfluid, or genderfree regardless of gender presentation or assigned sex at birth\". The December 2014 round was also open to participants of the Ascend Project of any gender, a training program for people from other groups underrepresented in open source. Starting in September 2015, Outreachy became open to \"residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander\", as people underrepresented in the technology industry in the US.\n\nAs part of the application process, applicants have to make a contribution to the project they want to work with. Participants work remotely, so the internship includes a $500 travel budget to support interns meeting fellow contributors in person and develop stronger connections to the project. Participants also write a blog about their work, which one said \"allowed me to meet many people interested in the same topic as myself and opened a completely different range of opportunities.\"\n\nThe GNOME Project has noted several signs that the program has improved its recruitment and retention of women contributors. In April 2011, it said its 3.0 release \"included more contributions by women than any previous release, an increase the project attributes [to] its new internship program.\" In November 2011, it said the program had also helped recruit seven women to its Google Summer of Code program that year, in comparison to one or zero women in previous years. At the project's annual conference, GUADEC, 17% of attendees (41) in 2012 were women, \"compared to only 4% (6 women) among attendees affiliated with GNOME three years earlier at the Desktop Summit 2009.\" In June 2013, program co-organizer Marina Zhurakhinskaya said half of the 41 participants had continued to contribute to GNOME after their internships, including five becoming mentors for the program.\n\nWikimedia said that working with the Outreach Program for Women and Google Summer of Code caused the project to develop better resources for newcomers interested in contributing to Wikimedia in general, including documentation and lists of suitable projects for newcomers.\n\nIn 2013, Bruce Byfield said \"Already, the program could claim to be the most successful FOSS program for women ever.\" In March 2014, the Free Software Foundation gave the program its annual Award for Projects of Social Benefit as part of the FSF Free Software Awards, saying that the program does \"critical work\", \"addressing gender discrimination by empowering women to develop leadership and development skills in a society which runs on technology.\"\n\nExplaining what has made the program effective, Zhurakhinskaya said \"You just need to say that women are welcome in your project, because that in itself sends a signal. Also, you want specific people they can get in touch with to do their first patch and to ask questions.\"\n\nIn June 2015, an Outreachy coordinator and Linux kernel contributor, Sage Sharp, won a Red Hat Women in Open Source Award for \"efforts in improving communications and inviting women into open source communities.\" In July 2015, program co-organizer Marina Zhurakhinskaya won an O'Reilly Open Source Award for her work on Outreachy.\n\nIn 2006, Hanna Wallach and Chris Ball noticed there were no women among the 181 applicants to GNOME's internship program with Google Summer of Code, and they decided to run GNOME's Women's Summer Outreach Program (WSOP) to invite participation from women. They organized it in about a month and focused on student developers. They received 100 applications and selected six for internships, half sponsored by the GNOME Foundation and half by Google. The students reported positive experiences and continued to use free and open-source software after the internship, but many of them did not have their work integrated into the main codebase.\n\nIn 2009, the GNOME community decided to revive the program as part of continuing efforts to encourage more women to contribute to GNOME, renaming it to the GNOME Outreach Program for Women. The GNOME Foundation board appointed Marina Zhurakhinskaya to organize it, including finding mentors for the program. The program's internship options expanded to include non-coding work such as documentation and localization, and it opened up to non-student applicants. To increase chances of success, the new application process included making an improvement to the project, and the internship shifted to encouraging several tasks incrementally incorporated into the main project, instead of one larger project like Google Summer of Code. After restructuring the program and finding interested projects and mentors within GNOME, they selected eight interns in November 2010.\n\nAnother eight interns, from five continents, began in May 2011. They included Priscilla Mahlangu, a South African woman translating GNOME desktop software into the Zulu language. Twelve interns started in November 2011, with sponsorship from Collabora, Google, Mozilla, Red Hat, and the GNOME Foundation.\n\nFor the May 2012 round, the Software Freedom Conservancy joined the program with an internship with the Twisted project, mentored by Jessica McKellar. Nine other interns worked on GNOME. \n\nThe January 2013 round of the program, renamed to the Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program for Women, expanded to provide 25 internships with 10 organizations (Deltacloud, Fedora, GNOME, JBoss, Mozilla, Open Technology Institute, OpenITP, OpenStack, Subversion, and Wikimedia), with GNOME Foundation Executive Director Karen Sandler joining Zhurakhinskaya in organizing the program.\n\nThe June 2013 internships included seven participants contributing to the Linux kernel, for example working on parallelizing the x86 boot process. Led by kernel contributor Sage Sharp, who found mentors and projects for the interns, they made significant contributions to the 3.11 kernel release. This round had 37 interns working with 16 organizations, and the next round starting in December 2013 had 30 interns working with 8 organizations.\n\nIn April 2014, the GNOME Foundation temporarily froze nonessential expenditures because of a budget shortfall linked to the Outreach Program for Women; it paid interns on a schedule that was sometimes before payments from sponsoring organizations arrived. This was related to the program growing quickly, and the Foundation said it would follow up with those organizations and take other steps to resolve the problem. GNOME Foundation board meeting notes from June 2015 indicate that the problem was resolved with all outstanding payments collected.\n\nThe May 2014 round had 40 participants and 16 organizations.\n\nThe December 2014 round was open to participants of the Ascend Project of any gender, a training program for people from groups underrepresented in open source.\n\nIn February 2015, the program announced its rename to Outreachy, while management of the program transferred to the Software Freedom Conservancy with the GNOME Foundation participating as a partner.\n\nStarting in September 2015, Outreachy became open to \"residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander\", as people underrepresented in the technology industry in the US.\n\n"}
{"id": "27156154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27156154", "title": "Professional requirements for architects", "text": "Professional requirements for architects\n\nProfessional requirements for architects vary from place to place, but usually consist of three elements: a university degree or advanced education, a period of internship or training in an office, and examination for registration with a jurisdiction.\n\nProfessionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they usually carried the title of Master Builder, or surveyor, after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir Christopher Wren). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.\n\nIn Australia, the title of architect is legally limited to those registered through state and territory Architects Registration Boards. These boards are affiliated through the Architects Accreditation Council of Australia (AACA). The AACA also conducts assessments for architects with overseas qualifications for the purposes of migration and/or registration as an architect in Australia. University Schools of Architecture are accredited by state and territory boards, based on a procedure jointly agreed by the AACA and the Australian Institute of Architects.\n\nThere are three key requirements for registration: a professional degree from an accredited school of architecture; at least two years of practical experience; and the completion of the architectural practice examination.\n\nArchitects may also be members of the Australian Institute of Architects (formerly the Royal Australian Institute of Architects), which is the professional organization. Members use the post-nominal letters RAIA.\n\nAll states and territories have legislation to govern the use of the title \"architect\" and make it an offence for anyone other than a registered architect to use the title. As exact requirements can vary, it is essential to check the relevant legislation in each State.\n\nIn Canada, architects are required to meet three common requirements for registration: education, experience, and examination. Educational requirements generally consist of an M.Arch. degree and are certified by the Canadian Architectural Certification Board (CACB). For degreed candidates, the experience requirement is typically the Intern Architect Program (IAP). The provincial associations of architects, by the authority granted under their respective provincial Architects Act, require that Interns gain a minimum of 5,600 hours of work experience. The fundamental purpose of the pre-registration/licensing employment period is to ensure that the Intern is provided with sufficient experience to meet the standards of practical skill and level of competence required to engage in the practice of architecture. This experience is diversified into four main categories and 16 sub-categories, and must be completed working under the direct supervision of a registered architect. At present, all jurisdictions use the Architect Registration Examination (ARE), a series of seven computerized exams administered by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB). As well, all jurisdictions recognize the Examination for Architects in Canada (ExAC), administered by the Pan Canadian ExAC Committee. Upon completion of the educational requirements, IAP, and examinations, one can apply for registration/license with their respective provincial architectural institute. Architects must pay an annual fee and meet continuing education requirements to maintain their license to practice.\n\nThe Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) was established in 1907 and is a voluntary national association representing more than 3,600 architects and Faculty and graduates of accredited Canadian Schools of Architecture. The RAIC aims to be \"the voice of Architecture and its practice in Canada\". Members are permitted to use the suffix MRAIC after their names. The suffix FRAIC (Fellow of the RAIC) is used by members of the RAIC College of Fellows. Not all members of the RAIC hold accredited degrees in architecture, and not all Canadian architects are members of the RAIC.\n\nTo practice as a project manager (maître d'oeuvre in French), an architect must meet the following requirements :\n\nIn France the profession is defined and regulated by the 1977 Law, which defines architecture as follows:\n\n\"Architecture is an expression of culture. Architectural design, quality of buildings, their harmonious incorporation into their surroundings, respect for natural and urban landscapes and architectural heritage are of public interest. The authorities responsible for issuing building permits and authorizations to subdivide ensure, during the processing of applications, compliance with this interest\"\n\nThis law, amongst others, sets the educational requirements to practice as an architect, and the rules under which exercise of the profession of architecture, in Titles III and IV.\n\nAccording to the 1977 law,\"Anyone wishing to undertake a construction subject to an application for a building permit, shall resort to an architect in order to establish the architectural project,\" But the \"Code for Urbanism\" sets the actual conditions and limits of mandatory resorting to the architect.\nContracting with an architect is mandatory solely if the construction project is in excess of 170 sqm flooring surface /or footprint on the parcel (this threshold rise up to 800 sqm for any farming building).\n\nArchitecture in France fully depends on the Culture Department of the French government, so does The National Superior Schools of Architecture, and the National Architects Order Board.\n\nEducation is provided by one of the 20 ENSA (National Superior School of Architecture) schools spread across the French territory, which are public schools. Tuition fees rise around 700 euros per year. See (in French).\n\nIn Germany, the title of architect is legally limited to those registered with a provincial Chamber of Architects (Architektenkammer http://www.architektenkammern.net/). Admission to a German chamber of architects is required for someone to be a professional architect. The chambers also register interior designers, landscape architects, and urban planners.(http://www.architekten-thueringen.de/english/)\n\nThere are three general requirements for registration, which vary from chamber to chamber: successful completion of a four-year architectural program, continuing professional education, and several years of practical experience under a registered architect. The registration with a chamber of architects is based on either place of residence of the architect or their workplace.\n\nAll provincial Chambers of Architects are members of the Federal Chamber of Architects (BAK - Bundesarchitektenkammer) located in Berlin. The federal chamber does not provide professional registration.\n\nFor carrying professional practice in India, architects are required to register with Council of Architecture, which is constituted by the Government of India under the provisions of the Architects Act, 1972. The profession of an architect is governed by the Architects Regulations, 1989 (as amended in 2003).\n\nThe COA registration service also provides accreditation for providing the degree of architecture, which is minimum five years duration including professional practice for 16 working weeks (one semester). There are about 280 institutions including constituent colleges/departments of universities, deemed universities, affiliated colleges/schools, IITs, NITs and autonomous institutions that impart architectural education in India leading to recognized qualifications. Indian law recognizes equal rights to Civil Engineer registered with the appropriate order. The under graduate degree program in Civil Engineering is of four year duration with out professional practice.\n\nThe main body for Architecture in Ireland is the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland, RIAI. Members may use the affix MRIAI and are registered to use the title \"Architect\" in company stationery. The title has only recently been protected.\n\nTo become a registered Architect, it usually takes five years' full-time study in the recognised schools of Architecture, followed by a minimum of two years approved experience, and one of the recognised Professional Practice qualifications to gain admission to the RIAI . In all, it takes a minimum of seven years to gain registration. More details can be found on the RIAI website.\n\nAn alternate route to the Register is available through the ARAE (Architects Register Admission Examination) - this provides an opportunity for those without the required educational and professional qualifications to enter the Register in Ireland. This examination has operated successfully since 2009.\n\nArchitects' Alliance of Ireland is a group of long-established self-trained architects created in response to Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007. The Act seeks for the first time to control the use of the term 'architect' in the Republic of Ireland. The group is lobbying for an amendment of the legislation to restore the prior status of self-trained architects in the profession.\n\nTo enter the profession in Italy, individuals are required to first obtain a degree in Architecture, or a degree in Building Engineering/ Architecture, then to receive professional qualification, obtained by passing a state exam with four tests (three written and one oral). To practice, the architect must register with the \"Ordine degli architetti\" (Order of Architects), which following a recent reform also includes planners, landscape architects and conservationists (architectural heritage). The Orders are organised by province, and registration is based on place of residence of the architect. Within the order there are currently several classes and categories, depending on specific qualifications.\n\nItalian law recognises equal rights to Building engineers registered with the appropriate order. Other professionals in the construction industry are the \"geometra\" (surveyor) and the \"perito industriale\" (technical expert) specialising in construction; these professionals have several limitations compared to architects and engineers, as they follow a different and shorter course of study aimed at learning basic and complementary aspects of work in construction.\n\nIn Mexico, every profession is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Education, including architecture. The Secretariat expedes a Professional License (in Spanish \"cédula profesional\"), only after a recognized undergraduate degree is successfully achieved. Therefore, it is legally sufficient for an architect to hold an undergraduate diploma and a Professional License to practice. Registration to an official college or association of architects is completely optional.\n\nNevertheless, other norms regulate the building industry. In Mexico, it is common for constructions to be developed by individuals other than architects, these regulations are quite unrelated to the architecture profession. For a major construction, it is necessary for a professional to act as a Director Responsible of Construction (in Spanish, \"Director Responsable de Obra\" or \"DRO\"). This position does require a minimum of two years of professional experience in construction, as well as further evaluation and/or training. However, it is uncommon for architects to assume this role; this is generally a position preferred by and reserved to civil engineers.\n\nIn Singapore, university study is required (such as the five-year course of study at the National University of Singapore or certain approved foreign universities). Upon completion of university, additional training by working for a minimum of two years under a registered architect is required to become registered. Singaporean law governs the use of the term \"architect\" and prescribes the requirements to be listed in the Register of Architects. Membership in the Singapore Institute of Architects is a voluntary professional credential.\n\nIn South Africa, Architecture can be practiced in one of four categories, depending on qualification: professional architect (Pr.Arch.), professional senior architectural technologist (Pr.S.Arch.T.), professional technologist (Pr.Arch.T.), or professional draughtsperson (Pr.Arch.Draught.). The possibility of progression from one category to the next has been provided for in the Regulations, and is under review.\n\nWhen studied through a University, the programme is structured in two parts: the first is a three-year course leading to a Bachelor of Architectural Studies or BSc (Architecture). The second is an additional two-year postgraduate, professional degree—either the Bachelor of Architecture or Master of Architecture, depending on University—which qualifies an individual to become an architect. A student can exit university after obtaining the first degree, and can become a senior architectural technologist. When studied through a University of Technology (or a comprehensive university), the courses in architecture are a three-year National Diploma, and, after an additional year of study, the B.Tech degree. These enable a student to become an architectural technologist or senior technologist, respectively. To become a draughtsperson, one requires a (two year) National Certificate.\n\nAfter graduating, one enters a two-year period of in service training as a \"candidate\", and sits a Professional Practice entrance examination; one must also register with the South African Council for the Architectural Profession. Qualified architects can become members of the South African Institute of Architects.\n\nTerm \"Architect\" and \"Chartered Architect\" are protected titles in Sri Lanka under the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects law (act) no. 1 of 1976 and the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (Amendment) Act, No. 14 of 1996.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, architects are required to meet three common requirements for registration: education, experience, and examination. The Education can be from one of the two available institutions; the degree course held by University of Moratuwa or by the part-time course held by the City School of Architecture (owned by the Sri Lanka institute of Architects) or by any foreign university recognized by the SLIA.\n\nThe University of Moratuwa has been offering a \"3+2\" program recognized by both the SLIA and RIBA; a three-year B.Sc. (Built Environment) degree and a two-year masters, M. Sc. (Architecture). This with the 2 years of appropriate work experience and successful completion of SLIA Part III examination would lead to the charter and the Architectural Registration Board (ARB) registration.\n\nRecently, the University of Moratuwa has changed the \"3+2\" program to a continuous five-year B.Arch. program.\n\nCity School of Architecture offers a part-time course of seven years during which the students should be working continuously under the supervision of a Chartered Architect while attending the school on a part-time basis. Completion of the first four years of this program qualifies for SLIA part I and completion of the balance after 3 years qualifies for SLIA part II. Successful completion of this program with the 1 year of appropriate work experience and successful completion of SLIA Part III examination would lead to the charter and the Architectural Registration Board (ARB) registration.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, practicing under the name, style or title \"architect\" is restricted by law to those registered at the Architects Registration Board. It usually takes a minimum of seven years to obtain the necessary qualifications and experience for registration. Those wishing to become registered must first study at a recognised university-level school of architecture. Though there are some variations from university to university, the basic principle is that to qualify as an architect, a candidate must pass through three stages administered by the Royal Institute of British Architects:\n\n\nIn the United States, people wishing to become licensed architects are required to meet the requirements of their respective state. Each state has a registration board to oversee that state's licensure laws. National Council of Architectural Registration Boards is a non-profit professional association created in 1919 to help ensure parity between the states' often conflicting rules. The registration boards of each of the 50 states (and 5 territories), member boards. NCARB issues a national certificate to qualified licensed architects. The NCARB certificate is recognized in most licensing jurisdictions for the purpose of granting licensure by endorsement or reciprocity.\n\nRequirements vary among jurisdictions, and there are three common requirements for registration: education, experience and examination. About half of the States require a professional degree from a school accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) to satisfy their education requirement; this would be either a B.Arch or M.Arch degree. The experience requirement for degreed candidates is typically the Architectural Experience Program (AXP), a joint program of and the American Institute of Architects (AIA). AXP creates a framework to identify for the intern architect base skills and core-competencies. The intern architect needs to earn roughly three years worth of experience across six specified divisions (Practice Management, Project Management, Programming & Analysis, Project Planning & Design, Project Development & Documentation, and Construction & Evaluation) all while working under the direct supervision of a licensed Architect. The states that waive the degree requirement typically require a full 10 years' experience in combination with the AXP diversification requirements before the candidate is eligible to sit for the examination. California requires C-IDP (Comprehensive Intern Development Program), which builds upon the seat time requirement of IDP with the need to document learning having occurred. All jurisdictions use the Architect Registration Examination (ARE), a series of six (formerly seven) computerized exams administered by NCARB. The NCARB also has a certification for those architects meeting NCARB's model standard: NAAB degree, AXP and ARE passage. This certificate facilitates reciprocity between the member boards should an architect desire registration in a different jurisdiction. All architects licensed by their respective states have professional status as Registered Architects (RA).\n\nDepending on the policies of the registration board for the state in question, it is sometimes possible to become licensed as an Architect in other ways: reciprocal licensure for over-seas architects and working under an architect as an intern for an extended period of time. Length of the typical licensure process depends on the particular combination of education, experience and pace of examination of a candidate. It is typical that the entire licensure process takes at least 7 to 11 years to complete; including five years of study (5 years for B.Arch, 3 years for M.Arch, 6 years for a \"four-plus-two\" program), three-plus years of experience (meeting exact IDP requirements in each category), and often a year or more to take and pass the seven ARE 4.0 exams.\n\n"}

He performed with Complexions Contemporary Ballet and Alpha Omega Theatrical Dance Company before founding BalaSole Dance Company.\n\nBorn and raised in Manila, after graduating early from Colegio de San Juan de Letran Villanueva moved to New York to study accounting at the University of Buffalo. Taking an introductory dance class to fulfill physical education requirements led him to switch his concentration to dance. Two years later he won the Dance Masters of America Competition and a special scholarship to the school of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Though acknowledged as a \"powerhouse dancer\" Villanueva was frequently passed over for work due to his short stature. Despite these restrictions he was invited by Desmond Richardson to join Complexions Contemporary Ballet. He also performed with Alpha Omega Theatrical Dance Company where he worked extensively with Eleo Pomare.\n\nFollowing the death of his father, Villanueva acknowledged his disenchantment with the lack of greater artistic prospects and became a financial manager for 15 years. During this period he graduated with his Masters from the Public Administration Program from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and work as cash fund manager for Wasserstein Perella & Co. and director of operations for American Bible Society. Frustrated by the continued dearth of representation in dance, Villanueva founded BalaSole Dance Company to \"address the inequity of opportunities afforded talented dancers with unconventional attributes\".

In 1922 the Royal Hibernian Military School moved to Shorncliffe, in Folkestone, Kent, and in 1924 it was merged with the Duke of York's Royal Military School which last, by then, was in its current location atop 'Lone Tree Hill' above Dover Castle.\n\nThe foundation of the School came about in 1769 when King George III granted a Charter of Incorporation on 15 July, the School Governors holding their inaugural meeting on 6 November in Dublin Castle.\n\nThe buildings housing the school were erected in 1771 in the Phoenix Park, overlooking the village of Chapelizod in the Liffey valley (in full view of Wicklow mountains). The chapel was designed by Thomas Cooley, while thirty years later Francis Johnston designed the extensions to the buildings. It first took in 90 boys and 50 girls as pupils (in the charge of an Inspector and Inspectress, assisted by the Chaplain and an assistant mistress) in March 1770. The site originally occupied but by 1922 its boundary walls enclosed thirty three acres.\n\nBy 1808 the system and organisation of the school followed closely that of its sister school, the Duke of York's Royal Military School (then at Chelsea, London, England). By 1816, when Thomas Le Fanu (father of Sheridan Le Fanu) took over as chaplain, there were 600 children at the school.\n\nIn 1853 the school's first \"stand of colours\" were presented by the then Prince of Wales and, in the same year, the girls at the school left to join their own separate establishment, the Drummond School, which was founded for them at Chapelizod.\n\nThe school acted as a feeder to the British Army, where In the mid-19th century, children as young as 12 could enlist in the Army but generally enlistment began at 14. By the 1900s 50 per cent of pupils were going straight into the army. By this stage the school was not only an orphanage; for instance, the Army Non-Commissioned Officer father of Liam Mellows entered him there to get a good basic military training which he hoped would lead to an army career, instead it was used during the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence, both in fighting and in training the flying columns in guerrilla warfare.\n\nIn 1922 the Royal Hibernian Military School moved to Shorncliffe, in Folkestone, Kent, and in 1924 it was merged with the Duke of York's Royal Military School which last, by then, was in its current location atop 'Lone Tree Hill' above Dover Castle.\n\nA stained glass window depicting a saluting boy soldier is sited above the 'minstrel gallery' type balcony of the Duke of York's School Chapel in Dover, and commemorates the merging of the schools.\n\nThe buildings of the Dublin campus are now part of St Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park.

After graduating in 1855, she taught in Newton and Boston. In 1869, she trained at the Clarke School for the Deaf under Harriet B. Rogers, then became principal at the newly formed Boston School for Deaf-Mutes; a school founded on the behest of Rev. Dexter S. King. In 1871, the school staff was trained in the skill of teaching deaf children how to speak by Alexander Graham Bell. Sarah became an advocate of this practice, as well as the promotion of education for deaf children starting at the earliest age possible. She was also present when the first message was sent over the telephone. \n\nIn 1890, Fuller applied the methods she learned and developed from Bell in giving the first speech lessons to Helen Keller.\n\nIn 1888, she published \"An Illustrated Primer\" for teachers of the deaf. She helped found the \"American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf\" in 1890, and became director of that association in 1896. She founded the Home for Little Deaf Children in 1902, and retired as a principal in 1910. Sarah died in Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts, and is buried in Saint Mary's Cemetery. She was a poetic writer.\n\nThe Sarah Fuller Foundation for Little Deaf Children (1888-1972) was named after her.\n\n"}

One or more actors perform a dramatic scene and are then offered feedback from teachers, classmates, or each other.\n\nScene Study is a very broad description for an acting class that will vary depending on the teacher or school that teaches it. Its foundation is in the performance of a \"scene\" or a segment of a play by the students. From this performance the instructor gives notes and suggestions to improve the student’s acting. Scene Study is instrumental for actors to get experience being directed. For beginning actors the Scene Study class may also include acting exercises that help them develop their technique. In actor Uta Hagen's novel, \"Respect for Acting\" she mentions the three entrances in Part Two, chapter twelve. The moment before is the first entrance, the actor must think of the scene before if it is his or her first time entering. If the actor enters in scene one, then he or she must think of what the character's circumstances before the play would be. These exercises may help with skills such as emotional connection or character development and for the real novice it may be used to teach the vocabulary of acting (for example terms like down stage and subtext). Other acting vocabulary includes objective, tactics, essential action, character, scene, acts, costumes, setting, and literal action. Objective, essential action, and literal action relates to what the character wants, as well as what the character is doing. Tactics are what the character does in order to get what they want. The other terms are design elements or basic elements that one sees on stage. It is the job of the actor to implement all of these terms in order to create a believable moment. However, most Scene Study classes are used for actors who already have their training and technique and now need the opportunity to take their skills and apply them towards performing on stage or on set. The best Scene Study classes will be able to keep improving an actor’s technique, as well as give them the opportunity to be directed and see if they are able to perform to a director’s specification. Scene Study is important because it allows an actor to see if all the techniques and exercises they use in class can be harnessed to create an honest and dynamic performance. Scene study is also important because the actor needs to focus on the other actor. Reacting is just as important as acting, if the actor fails to react to their scene partner then the believability diminishes. Scene study gives the actors the opportunity to work together and remember that it is not \"all about them.\" \n\nReference - http://www.emasla.com/acting_class/los_angeles_actingclass_scene.html\nUta Hagen, \"Respect for Acting\" https://books.google.com/books/about/Respect_for_Acting.html?id=4yhAGpIhYdcC\n"}

It is almost certainly a pseudoscience, as this particular kind of sleep learning is almost certainly impossible. Many studies have claimed to discredit the technique's effectiveness, but some others claim to have found that the brain indeed reacts to stimuli and processes them while asleep, though these have been criticised for spurious methodology (for instance, the researchers couldn’t be sure that they hadn’t just awoken to listen to the recording).\n\nIn 1927, Alois Benjamin Saliger invented the Psycho-Phone for sleep learning, stating that \"It has been proven that natural sleep is identical with hypnotic sleep and that during natural sleep the unconscious mind is most receptive to suggestions.\"\n\nSince the electroencephalography studies by Charles W. Simon and William H. Emmons in 1956, learning by sleep has not been taken seriously. The researchers concluded that learning during sleep was \"impractical and probably impossible\". They reported that stimulus material presented during sleep was not recalled later when the subject awoke unless alpha wave activity occurred at the same time the stimulus material was given. Since alpha activity during sleep indicates the subject is about to awake, the researchers felt that any learning occurred in a waking state.\n\nIn 2012, research from the Weizmann Institute of Science indicated that classical conditioning can occur during sleep by using odor recognition. \"During sleep, humans can strengthen previously acquired memories, but whether they can acquire entirely new information remains unknown. The nonverbal nature of the olfactory sniff response, in which pleasant odors drive stronger sniffs and unpleasant odors drive weaker sniffs, allowed us to test learning in humans during sleep.\"\n\nThe idea of sleep-learning is found in influential science fiction and other literature. The following examples are listed chronologically by publication or original air date, when known.\n\n\n\n"}

Later, SparkNotes expanded to provide study guides for a number of other subjects, including biology, chemistry, economics, health, math, physics, and sociology. SparkNotes does not charge users but instead earns revenue from advertising.\n\nBarnes & Noble acquired SparkNotes.com in 2001 for approximately $3.5 million.\n\nTheSpark.com was a literary website launched by four Harvard students on January 7, 1999. Most of TheSpark's users were high school and college students. To increase the site's popularity, the creators published the first six literature study guides (called \"SparkNotes\") on April 7, 1999.\n\nIn 2000, the creators sold the site to iTurf Inc. The following year, Barnes & Noble purchased SparkNotes and selected fifty literature study guides to publish in print format. When Barnes & Noble printed SparkNotes, they stopped selling their chief competitor, CliffsNotes.\n\nIn January 2003, SparkNotes developed a practice test service called SparkNotes Test Prep. This project was followed by the release of SparkCharts, reference sheets that summarize a topic; No Fear Shakespeare, transcriptions of Shakespeare's plays into modern language; and No Fear Literature, transcriptions of literary classics like \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" and \"The Scarlet Letter\" into modern language.\n\nSparkNotes Test Prep provides content and services related to the ACT, and AP, GRE and PSAT/SAT I and II standardized tests. Barnes & Noble sells printed versions of the test prep study guides, as well as SparkCharts and other printed study materials, in the United States and at Chapters in Canada.\n\nThe SparkNotes.com website also includes a section students can use to search for colleges.\n\nSparkNotes has moved into educational publishing with books, such as \"Poetry Classics\" and \"FlashKids\", a series of educational books for Kindergarten to grade 8 students. They also provide exercises for high school teachers.\n\nSparkNotes also has a section called SparkLife, a social section focused on non-educational topics for teens and young adults. This section of the site includes blogs, advice columns (most notably by \"Auntie Sparknotes\"), contributed posts, and Open Threads, which members can use to chat with one another without commenting on a specific post.

{"id": "40714246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40714246", "title": "Star Wars: Tiny Death Star", "text": "Star Wars: Tiny Death Star\n\nStar Wars: Tiny Death Star was a business simulation video game developed by Disney Mobile and NimbleBit, and published by Disney Mobile for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and Windows 8/RT devices. It is based on NimbleBit's previous game, \"Tiny Tower\", and is set in the \"Star Wars\" universe.\n\n\"Star Wars: Tiny Death Star\" was announced by Disney Interactive Studios on October 4, 2013. It was released in Australia and New Zealand for Android devices on October 11, 2013 and in Australia for iOS devices on October 15, 2013. It was released worldwide on November 8, 2013 for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Windows 8 and Windows RT devices.\n\nThe game was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store by Disney in October 2014.\n\nThe goal is to build and expand a Death Star, while attracting virtual people known as \"galactic Bitizens\" to build and run virtual businesses within the Death Star.\n\nThe main currency is \"Imperial Credits\". Credits are made by selling products on business levels or by trading \"Imperial Bux\" in for them. Imperial Bux are used in Tiny Death Star to complete construction and product orders instantly, unlock specific floors, unlock specific species, upgrade elevators, unlock costumes, instantly recruit Bitizens into a residential level, hire \"VIP\"s and earn money more quickly. Imperial Bux can be purchased by going to the \"Get Bux\" option on the main menu. Using Tapjoy offers, it is also possible to earn free Imperial Bux by completing offers such as downloading and running apps or signing up for programs.\n\nWhile playing Tiny Death Star, \"Bitizens\", Levels, and Scenes are unlocked in the album. Throughout gameplay, new species of bitzens are unlocked when they appear in the elevator or are found throughout the Death Star. These bitzens are sorted into the following categories: \"Bounty Hunters\", \"Droids\", \"Men of the Rebellion\", \"Ladies of the Rebellion\", \"Rebel Heroes\", \"Rebel Aliens\", \"Outer Rim\", \"Troops\", \"Rebel Forces\", \"The Force\", \"Cantina Crew\", \"Hutt's Henchmen\", \"Limited Edition\", \"Galactic Registry Series 1\" and \"The Deep Core\".\n\nThe levels that are built to make your Death Star larger are sorted into six categories: food, service, recreation, retail, residential and imperial. Residential levels are used to house bitzens which can then be put to work making credits in the business levels. The food, service, recreation, and retail levels are built as businesses used to make credits. Credits are used to build new levels. In the businesses, a maximum of three Bitizens which reside in one of the residential floors are assigned to work. They order in products. How long the products take to arrive depends on the Bitizen's skill level at the given job. Imperial levels are used to produce \"Imperial Items\" for missions. When these missions are completed, credits are awarded. Each of the categories of business levels currently have ten possible levels to unlock. As more updates arrive, new levels will be available to unlock.\n\nScenes are unlocked when the elevator is used to take a specific individual (or sometimes member of a species) to a specific level.\n\nScene Unlocking List:\n\nStores\n\n\n\nApartments\n\nImperial Levels\n\n\nApart from just the ordinary Bitizens, there are also VIPs, who randomly appear in the elevator. Up to 5 VIPs can be stored in the lobby at any one time, and they can kept for any period of time. VIPs are used to improve the Death Star. They help attract customers to your levels, complete tasks faster, move levels, upgrade levels, or even fill an entire vacant residential floor with tenants.\n\nThe \"Holiday Update\" (version 1.0.1.4), released on December 17, 2013, featured 'Decorator Droids'. These limited edition VIPs decorate a floor with holiday/Christmas lights. Limited edition rewards were available to those who decorated enough floors. In early January 2014 this promotion expired (decorated floors were brought back to normal) and the Decorator Droids are no longer available.\n\nWhen the game was originally released, one major problem was discovered: the \"Negative Bux\" glitch. This glitch occurs when the player uses Imperial Bux to purchase a specific level (and not a random one, which is the norm, using Imperial Credits). The result is that the player winds up with a negative balance of Bux, otherwise impossible to achieve. The player then has to balance this account before he/she can begin to accumulate Bux and purchase other goods. To make this matter worse, if a player has bought Bux, with real money, they can lose the \"in-game currency\" to this glitch. As of December 17, 2013, this bug has been fixed.\n\nAs of July 2014, some users are reporting a new bug, where their Galactic Registry 1 bitizens have changed into random people. The Besalisk species has disappeared from the album, and existing in-game besalisk bitizens are being erroneously replaced by a character of Lando Calrissian. Cornelius Evazan's appearance has become incorrect. Imperial assignments still do not operate after a certain point early in the game, making the imperial levels mostly pointless. All of the Salvage Droids' \"Possible Salvage\" screens show the same panoply of ewoks instead of the correct possibilities of the currently scanned areas.\n\nIn October 2014, Disney pulled the app from the App Store and Google Play. Co-developer Nimblebit was not given notice prior to the removal. As of December 11, 2015, it is unavailable on both the Windows Store and the App Store. Disney removed the game from all app stores because they wanted to take the Star Wars games in another direction. The developer, Nimblebit, was furious at the removal of the game, because it was a high source of revenue, despite the multitude of bugs that had plagued it since its initial release. \n\nIf a user had previously downloaded the game (i.e.: via GooglePlay), said user can re-download the game, despite its being unavailable. Some features (such as the Tapjoy Bux purchasing) are disabled, but players can still tend to their Bitizens.\n\n\n"}

It offers preschool/kindergarten through 12th grade, and had an enrollment of 284 in 2011. Founded in 1981, it is one of approximately more than 250 independent North American and 1,000 worldwide Waldorf schools. The school is an accredited member school of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America].\n\nIn September 2008, the school inaugurated its high school program with Grade 9.\n\nThe school has received financial support and guidance from the Rudolf Steiner Foundation.\n\nThe Waldorf School of San Diego also serves as a campus for the Waldorf teacher training program of the Waldorf Institute of Southern California.\n\nThe curriculum of the Waldorf School of San Diego is based on the educational philosophy developed by Rudolf Steiner. Each grade provides educational activities that are designed to respond to the physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual needs at that stage of the children's development. The visual arts, music and other performing arts, and handcrafts are emphasized, as well as traditional subjects including reading, English, history, mathematics, science, and geography.\n\nThe hallmark of a Waldorf education is the schooling of the head, heart and hands. The school's goal is not only to develop each child's intellect but to ensure that they will engage themselves in the world with an open heart. Working with the hands is one of the ways to develop the neurological passageways that establish the foundation of thinking. Conscious development and training of the hands using diverse mediums such as copper work, stained glass, beeswax, woodwork, blacksmithing, and felting, leads to enhanced cognition and understanding for the students. Another hallmark is the integration of an artistic component into every academic subject, even history, math and science. This keeps the students interested and engaged in the most difficult topics exciting and fun.\n\nThe early childhood program is play-based so that each child can develop vital social and emotional skills, as well as artistic and imaginative skills (the foundation for memory and retention). The focus is also on building a strong, healthy physical body through plenty of outdoor play, bio-dynamic gardening, daily movement in circle time with songs, verses and games, and organic food served daily. The fine and gross motor skills are refined so that a foundation is laid for the academic work that begins in grade 1.\nIn grades 1-8, there is no testing or grading, so the work done by each student comes from a genuine love of learning. The Main Lesson teacher who leads most of the academic work consistently assesses each student's progress throughout the year, and parents receive a substantial year-end report. There is also a short written report from each of the 7-8 Special Subjects teachers.\n\nThe school's gardening program has included instruction in biodynamic composting and a project to plant fruit trees on the campus.\nFollowing the strong foundation of early childhood and the elementary grades, the students are well prepared for the rigorous academic work brought in high school, where they receive a broad and rich education. In high school, the students are developmentally ready for testing and grading, which is documented in mid-year and year-end report cards - all closely monitored by the student in conjunction with each subject teacher (up to 14 different teachers, each an expert in their field of study). The social and community service that is an integral part of the high school journey helps the teenager navigate adolescence with a warm heart and a sense of purpose. The end result is an enlivening education which puts a high value on Waldorf students at colleges and universities across the country and abroad.\n\nCurriculum related field trips begin in grade 1 and continue through to grade 12. There is a particular focus on sustainable outdoor adventure, along with social and community service in the two week trips at the end of grade 8 and grade 11.\n\nThe school offers a wide variety of sports, including track and field, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, water polo, and dance. Beginning in the 6th grade, students may join the girls' or boys' basketball team, or the co-ed soccer team, all of which compete in local leagues.\n\n\n\n"}
