In order to become a licensed architect in the State of California, a candidate must pass this exam in addition to passing the required national architect registration exams, and completing all other requirements. The exam was previously delivered in an oral format, but around 2010 it was converted to be a computer-delivered, multiple-choice examination.\n\nThe exam is administered through a vendor, by permission of the California Architects Board. Upon completion of the Intern Development Program and successful completion of the Architect Registration Examination, a candidate is then permitted to sit for the California Supplemental Exam. The test plan is organized into four separate topics covering a variety of specific aspects of architectural Practice.\n\nThe exam was previously a structured oral examination that lasted approximately 1.5 hours. It was administered by a panel of three architects with current California registration. A question was asked to the candidate, with no further clarification of the question allowed. The candidate was to give an answer that is scored by each member of the panel independently. The number of questions was approximately thirty.\n\nCandidates were given the opportunity to demonstrate through oral responses their overall understanding of architectural practice, and required to demonstrate at least entry-level competence in the areas outlined in the CSE test plan. A competent entry-level architect is able to discharge the responsibilities incumbent upon him or her in providing professional architectural services to the public. Additionally, a competent entry-level architect must understand the integration of architectural practice and the architect's responsibilities as they relate to architectural practice in California.\n\nThe exam is based on a hypothetical project and includes graphic and written documents that candidates have the opportunity to review prior to - and have access to during - the CSE. The project description and graphics provide a focus for the examination questions and establish a context for candidate responses.\n\nThe oral format was phased out in 2010, and the exam is now in a timed computer-delivered multiple choice format.\n\nThe test plan has not changed since the format of the test moved from oral to multiple choice on a computer, and is based on the results of a statewide survey of practicing California architects. The intent of the test plan is not to duplicate coverage of general areas of practice already addressed by the national test, the Architectural Registration Examination, but to focus on California-specific aspects of practice; it is therefore neither comprehensive nor representative of the full scope of architectural practice.\n\nThe exam administered in 2009-2010 was based on a test plan that is divided into four categories of architectural knowledge and abilities important to the tasks that California architects perform, as follows:\n\nThe board has a list of reference materials for the 2009-2010 administrations which can assist candidates in preparing for the exam. The list details the resources with which to be familiar and how they may be obtained. Some of the materials are available for a nominal cost, and others for free.\n\n"}

The theoretical framework was created by Joni Mäkivirta.\n\n\nMäkivirta claims that traditional education is creativity-deprived because it focuses on conceptual extension and rearrangement, but not on paradigmatic structuring, even though the latter has been responsible for paradigm shifts that have created the greatest progress in human knowledge.\n\nAccording to the theory all three types of learning happen at all ages, but the greatest amount of paradigmatic structuring takes place in the early childhood. Traditional schooling is criticized for destroying the ability to learn paradigmatically by conditioning students to believe that the teacher is the only source of reliable knowledge and using assessment as a 'cognitive control tool'. This practice is particularly detrimental if assessment tasks are inappropriate for the students' level of cognitive maturity.\n\nAccording to Mäkivirta the 'fact fetish' and the overemphasis of mathematical and linguistic operations at expense of emotional engagement and concept discovery lead to deprived and biased thinking and prevent development of fully functioning intellect.\n\nMäkivirta suggests that more effective and transformative learning can be achieved if the learning content is delivered using Cognitive Emotional Pedagogy (CEP) that combines creative emotional experiences with learning tasks. To create a learning environment that supports CEP, schools should align their pedagogical practices and learning cultures with the principles of CEP.\n\n\nTeacher training based on CEP principles is available by some educational consultancies. Teacher training focuses on topics such as rediscovering creativity; constructive verbal and non-verbal communication; CEP in lesson and unit planning; CEP pedagogy in different learning contexts; and building of creative and positive learning communities.\n\nChabot, Michel (2006): Emotional Pedagogy.

He also focussed on articulating the different realms of the social environment: shared in families, unique to individuals, neighbourhood or nation level social and cultural effects. His book \"The Limits of Family Influence: Genes, Experience and Behaviour\" brought together much of this work.\n\nThis work led to several substantive findings on shared and nonshared environmental influences; seminal work on the heritability of parenting behaviors (the genetics of the environment for children); on the heritability of antisocial behavior; race differences and their causes; for testing the interaction of education, and social class with genes in the development of intelligence; and for blending behavioral and molecular genetics. He made several methodological contributions, including work on modeling of means and covariances with raw data, the utility of the DeFries–Fulker analysis, and measured genes and environmental influences. The Add Health data featured in much of his research, and he served as the main geneticist on this large and influential survey of over 90,000 adolescents across the United States.\n\nRowe's work highlighted the often surprising immunity of mental states to social circumstances, reporting that \"great fortune does not guarantee happiness; neither does great misfortune assure depression\". This led to his positing of biological set points as a mechanism for stability, as well as arguing for indirect genetic effects: that different genotypes would cause different people to react to the same environment in different ways, and, moreover, that individuals expose themselves to different social environments. This led to ideas about active seeking and environment construction, as well the idea that exposure to (controllable) life events may result partly from genetic predisposition. He was an advocate of Consilience: including biological individuality along with social, psychological, and cultural factors in any understanding of human behavior.\n\nIn 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on \"Mainstream Science on Intelligence,\" an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the \"Wall Street Journal\", which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on issues related to intelligence research following the publication of the book \"The Bell Curve\".

The programs were organized between 1912 and 1927 largely by a group of Chinese anarchists who had come to Paris and wanted to introduce French science and social idealism to China.\n\nAfter organizing smaller-scale programs starting in 1908, in 1916, after the outbreak of First World War, the Chinese organizers worked with the Chinese and French governments to establish the Diligent Work-Frugal Study program, which brought less educated Chinese workers, and continued to bring students after the 1919 end of the war. In all, several thousand Chinese came to France as student-workers, though not all as formal members of a program. They included future leaders of the Chinese Communist Party such as Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, as well as others who went on to prominent roles in China.\n\nWell before Marxist socialism entered China, Chinese anarchists took up the cause of labor and educating the working class. The leaders of the Chinese Anarchist movement in Paris -- Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Renjie. Wang Jingwei, Wu Yuzhang, and Cai Yuanpei—supported Sun Yat-sen but urged him to add a social and cultural aspect to his program of political revolution. They argued that individuals could not liberate themselves, but that educated men had the responsibility as teachers to use moral education and personal rectitude to show others the way. At the time, most students who went abroad went on government scholarships to Japan, though the Chinese Educational Mission of 1872-1881 and the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program sent students to the United States. The Paris anarchists were eager to establish interchange with France, which they regarded as a progressive and secular society.\n\nIn 1908 Li Shizeng planned the first Work-Study program as a way to bring young Chinese to France. He opened the Usine de la Caséo-Sojaïne, which manufactured soy products for the French market. The workers' study would be financed by working in his factory and their character would be uplifted by his regimen of moral instruction. This first Work-Study program eventually brought 120 workers to France. Li aimed to take these worker-students, who he called \"ignorant\" and \"superstitious,\" and make them into knowledgeable and moral citizens who on their return home would become models for a new China. They received instruction in Chinese, French, and science and were required to abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and gambling.\n\nIn April 1912, excited by the success of the Chinese revolution and the prospect of the new-born Republic of China, Li, Zhang Renjie, Wu Zhihui, and Cai Yuanpei, who had returned to Beijing, founded the Association for Frugal Study in France (), also known as the Society for Rational French Education (Societé Rationelle des Etudiants Chinois en France). Students traveled from China via the Siberian railway, a trip which took about eighteen days and cost approximately two hundred dollars. The Society prepared students for inexpensive study (¥600 a year) in France and \"by labor and a simple life to cultivate habits of diligence and hard work.\" In contrast to his own experience when he came in 1902 as an \"embassy scholar,\" which involved only a handful of students from privileged families, Li hoped to welcome hundreds of working-class students into the program. Wu Zhihui, who came from a poor family himself, remarked that actually the program would be especially good for students from rich families: \"even if they do not study anything, if at least they learn how to clean toilets it will be worth it.\"\n\nThe Association opened a preparatory school in Beijing which offered aspiring students a six-month course in French. When the first group of 30 student-workers for his factory reached France in January 1913, Li arranged for them to be admitted to the College at Montargis, south of Paris, where his warm relations with city officials made arrangements easier. The Association established a workers' school near the factory, in which Li and Wu taught Chinese, French language, and general scientific knowledge. In addition to making workers more knowledgeable, work-study would eliminate their \"decadent habits\" and transform them into morally upright and hard-working citizens. A strict regimen was imposed — no smoking, gambling or alcohol  — and the workers were expected to devote their spare time to study. In all, this program brought more than 120 students to France before it was closed down in 1913 by Yuan Shikai, the new president of China, who regarded its leaders as associates if his rival, Sun Yat-sen.\n\nThe outbreak of war in 1914 led France to recruit Chinese workers for factory work and heavy manual labor. The Chinese Labor Corps in France eventually brought more than 130,000 workers, mostly from North China villages. In June 1915, Li and his Paris friends took this opportunity to provide schooling and training. The Work-Study program was renewed, though on a different basis, bringing less educated workers rather than students. By March 1916 their Paris group, the Société Franco-Chinoise d'Education () was directly involved in recruiting and training these workers. The Société had well-placed French backers, mostly on the political left, including Alphonse Aulard, the first president of the Société, a professor of French history at the Sorbonne; Marius Moutet, vice-president and a socialist member of the National Assembly from Lyon; and Édouard Herriot, mayor of Lyon. They pressed the French government to give the Chinese workers technical education as well as factory work. Li wrote extensive articles in the \"Chinese Labor Journal\" (Huagong zazhi), which introduced readers to Western science, arts, fiction, and current events.\n\nBy 1917, the Society had established feeder schools in Beijing, Baoding, and Changxingdian, in North China. Students in Hunan wanted to found a preparatory school, but the provincial government at Changsha refused to help. A delegation went to Beijing in February 1918 to consult with Li and Cai. The financial support they obtained from the Beijing government attracted even more students from Hunan, including Mao Zedong. Cai and Li told student leaders that the government had little money but would lend them transportation funds, in return, students would be expected to teach laborers in France. The first group of thirty students to go to France repaid the loan within five months, allowing two groups a year to follow.\n\nThe new students came from a wide background. The Work-Study movement now offered overseas study to those whose education stopped at the middle-school level or below. The preparatory schools at Baoding and Changxingdian required only that applicants have basic Chinese and that they not possess \"bad habits\" such as smoking or gambling. The low tuition fees charged by the preparatory schools and the specially reduced boat fares Li Shizeng negotiated with French authorities also increased the numbers of students who could come on the program.\n\nIn 1919 and 1920, even after the signing of the peace, the Sino-French Education Association sponsored 17 groups of Chinese students, totaling nearly 1,600, who were placed in factories and schools, including increased numbers of students from the poorer inland provinces of Hunan and Sichuan. Among these were the future leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Deng Xiaoping, then 16 years old, who had been recruited by Wu Yuzheng in Chongqing, and Xu Teli, then in his early 40s, the future commissar of education at Yan'an in 1937.\n\nDeng arrived in France on October 19, 1920, but within three months the Sichuan Association which sponsored his trip ran out of money. Deng then worked at Schneider & Co., France's largest ordnance manufacturer, in Creusot, a southern city. Deng was surprised to see white people treat Chinese like slaves in Shanghai and other ports along the way. Although he and many of his Chinese colleagues had considered themselves economically well off in China, they now worked long hours in poor conditions while they saw French families living in luxury unknown in China. Deng learned how to use an industrial welder, a skill which proved useful when he was deposed from power during the Cultural Revolution and sent to work in a factory.\n\nIn 1921, word spread that Wu Zhihui was bringing one-hundred students from Guangdong and Guangxi provinces who were to be given first preference in enrolling at the Institute in Lyons. Worker-students already in France, unhappy with their miserable conditions and fearful that their stipends were about to be cut off, went to Lyons to protest. The protests escalated into riots which led to the expulsion of their leaders from France. The \"Lyons Incident\" turned the younger generation of students into angry critics who dismissed anarchism as a revolutionary doctrine and rejected older leaders such as Wu, Li, and Cai Yuanpei. The Institute survived but did not play the hope for central role in Sino-French relations.\n\nThe student-workers did not all learn the lessons in French civilization that the organizers hoped. One student, Wang Ruofei, a future Chinese communist leader, sounded satisfied when he wrote\nHowever, Chen Yi, who later became a high ranking communist general, worked at a Michelin plant and complained that factory life had nothing to do with the ideals of equality, freedom and fraternity supposedly characteristic of French society. Rather, it had shown him the \"evil nature\" of European capitalism at first hand.\n\nAmong the radical students who came to France in 1919 were Cai Hesen, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and Cai Chang, all friends of from Hunan province. Mao himself remained in China. Cai Hesen wrote to Mao in August and September 1920 to share his experiences and expound on the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat which he learned in France. He urged Mao to prepare for an \"October 1917 style\" revolution in China. A centralized vanguard party which would usher in a proletarian dictatorship was essential, Cai insisted, in order to combat anarchism on the one hand and bourgeois dictatorship on the other. France would not be China's ally and model, he concluded, but the Soviet Union.\n\nStudent-workers in France who went on to leadership roles in the Chinese Communist Party included Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Cai Hesen, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Li Lisan, Li Weihan, Nie Rongzhen, Wang Ruofei, Xiang Jingyu, Xu Deheng, Xu Teli, Zhao Shiyan, and Zhu De. Participants in the program or those who worked with them who went on to prominent roles in other areas included Li Huang (), founder of the Chinese Youth Party.\n\nProgram students were overwhelmingly male, though there were perhaps forty women.

{"id": "2666148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2666148", "title": "Domestication theory", "text": "Domestication theory\n\nDomestication theory is an approach in science and technology studies and media studies that describe the processes by which innovations, especially new technology is 'tamed' or appropriated by its users. First, technologies are integrated into everyday life and adapted to daily practices. Secondly, the user and its environment change and adapt accordingly. Thirdly, these adaptations feedback into innovation processes in industry, shaping the next generation of technologies and services.\nThe theory was initially developed to help understand the adoption and use of new media technologies by households (Silverstone et al. 1992), but has since been expanded in the innovation literature as a tool to understand technologies and innovations entering any consuming unit (workplace, country etc. e.g. Lie et al., Habib, Punie, Sørensen) that can be analysed economically, culturally and sociologically. The domestication approach considers both the practical and the symbolic aspects of the adoption and use of technologies, showing how these two elements- the meanings of things, and their materiality, are equally important understanding how technologies become part of everyday life. It is a foremost a social theory as it highlights the negotiations, challenges to power and control, rule-making and breaking that accompany the introduction of technologies into any social setting.\n\nOne variant of domestication theory identified three stages of technology being adapted by users. According to Nancy K. Baym, these three stages are (1) initially marvelous and strange, (2) then become capable of creating greatness and horror and (3) and are then so ordinary as to be invisible (Baym, 2015). This can also be thought of as (1) euphoria, (2) moral panic, and (3) domestication. An example of this is the introduction of video games into society. Initially, there was a euphoric response to video games as it had the potential to improve hand, eye, and brain coordination. Then, moral panic set in and there was a fear of violence, addiction, and obesity. Lastly, there was a domestication of video games with acceptance of the technology as an ordinary part of society. \n\nThe Domestication approach has roots in cultural studies of media use, but is informed by Science and technology studies, gender studies of household technology, sociology of everyday life, consumption studies and innovation studies, and has been most widely used in studying the mass adoption of computers, the internet and mobile phones.\n\nAs a strand of the Social shaping of technology approach to understanding how technology is created, Domestication theory highlights the role of users in innovation - the work done by individuals and communities in order to make a technology from the outside do practical work, and make sense within that community. This strand of work links to the role of end users, lead users etc. in long term innovation processes (Williams et al. 2004).\n\nDomestication studies are generally done using qualitative methods, such as long interviews and ethnography to explore the emerging meanings of technologies, and the changing routines, and conflicts that would not normally be accessible to quantitative methods.\n\nThe Domestication approach uses a number of different concepts to distinguish various aspects of the process. For example: Appropriation is the process of bringing a technology into a household, or another local cultural context; Conversion is the remaking of the meanings, or values and norms associated with the technology and the transfer of these back to the 'outside' world.\n\nThe principal criticism of the domestication approach is its reliance on detailed case studies, and its rather descriptive approach which is difficult to turn into prescriptive lessons of the type required by business and policy makers. However, this rich-descriptive approach is also its strength: it enables processes and the complex interplay of artifacts and cultural values to be explored in much more depth than individualistic, quantitative methods.\n\nThe Domestication approach, describing the integration of technologies into social relationships and structures using evidence obtained using qualitative methods, stands in sharp contrast to individualistic and quantitative approaches (such as Technology acceptance model) of North-American marketing and IS research, that draw on primarily psychological models.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "350401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=350401", "title": "Fundamentals of Engineering Examination", "text": "Fundamentals of Engineering Examination\n\nThe Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam, also referred to as the Engineer in Training (EIT) exam, and formerly in some states as the Engineering Intern (EI) exam, is the first of two examinations that engineers must pass in order to be licensed as a Professional Engineer in the United States. The exam is open to anyone with a degree in engineering or a related field, or currently enrolled in the last year of an ABET-accredited engineering degree program. Some state licensure boards permit students to take it prior to their final year, and numerous states allow those who have never attended an approved program to take the exam if they have a state-determined number of years of work experience in engineering. A selection of states allow those with ABET-accredited \"Engineering Technology\" or \"ETAC\" degrees to take the examination. The state of Michigan has no admission pre-requisites for the FE. The exam is administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES).\n\nAs of 2014, the FE and FS exams are offered only via Computer Based Testing (CBT). The exam is now given over a total of 5 hours and 20 minutes, has 110 questions, is divided differently, etc. The subjects of the different exams are chemical, civil, electrical and computer, environmental, industrial and systems, mechanical, and other disciplines. \n\nPrior to 2014, the exam was divided into two 4-hour sessions with a lunch break in between. The morning session consisted of 120 questions in a range of scientific/engineering subjects and had to be taken by all examinees, while the afternoon session consisted of 60 questions and could be taken either in a specific discipline or as a general engineering test. In 2015, content changes in the exam were instituted to make it entirely discipline-specific, with a plan of weaving general engineering subject matter (e.g. math and science fundamentals) throughout the exam. Less of the \"full breadth\" of most traditional engineering undergraduate curricula will be captured with this approach - such as the broad math and science foundation spanning chemistry, physics, mechanics (i.e. statics and dynamics), materials science, computer science, electronics/circuits, engineering design, and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. calculus, differential equations, statistics). A concern was that, while most undergraduate engineering students are in fact exposed to most of these subjects, they may not necessarily take courses in specialized topics such as thermodynamics and fluid mechanics.\n\nA scaled score of 70 is required to pass the exam. This does not mean one needs to answer 70% of the answers correctly to pass, however. A portion of previous exam questions are then given on subsequent exams. After the exam, a statistical analysis of these questions is used to equate the new test to the benchmark test. This makes all of the tests more or less equal in difficulty.\n\nThose who pass the exam are sometimes designated Engineer In Training or Engineer Intern, depending on their state's licensure board's approach to recognizing those who are partway through the licensure process. After obtaining a given amount of work experience (the length of which is set by state law and may be based on the type of degree received), an EIT/EI may qualify to take the Professional Engineer (PE) exam. Actual licensure can then be applied for and awarded upon successful completion of the PE exam. The standard time of work experience (which may need to be under a Professional Engineer) is four years in most US states, for graduates of an ABET-accredited engineering program.\n\nWriting tools and scratch paper may not be brought to the testing site. A fine-tip pen and a test booklet may be used as scratch paper for working problems. No calculators are allowed except for those specifically approved by NCEES; these models have no programming or communications capabilities to prevent possibilities of cheating. The only reference material that may be used is a handbook which is provided to examinees on the testing program. For study purposes, the reference handbook may be obtained from the NCEES website or by purchasing a hard copy. However, examinees may not bring their own copies to the test site; they must use the ones issued to them by the testing program. \n\nNCEES allows only the following calculators to be used on the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam:\n\nThe calculator must clearly display its model number so that exam proctors can quickly identify the calculator and approve for use during the exam. The list of allowed calculators is revised each November. It is crucial that any examinee check the NCEES website to verify their calculator is acceptable. Using a non-permitted calculator after the exam has begun will result in the examinee having his or her exam confiscated immediately and the exam not being scored. Calculator covers may not be brought into the testing room.\n\nPassage of the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam or graduation with any bachelor's degree or equivalent experience, satisfies the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's technical requirements for sitting for its registration examination to become either a registered patent attorney or patent agent. This is specified in \"Category C\" on page 8 of the General Requirements Bulletin.\n\n\n"}

Her credits include the roles of FBI Special Agent Dana Scully in the long-running series \"The X-Files\", ill-fated socialite Lily Bart in Terence Davies' film \"The House of Mirth\" (2000), and DSU Stella Gibson on the BBC crime drama television series \"The Fall\". Among other honours, Anderson has won a Primetime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. She has lived in London since 2002, after earlier years divided between the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nAfter beginning her career on stage, Anderson achieved international recognition for her role as FBI Special Agent Dana Scully on the American sci-fi drama series \"The X-Files\". Her film work includes the dramas \"The Mighty Celt\" (2005), \"The Last King of Scotland\" (2006), \"Shadow Dancer\" (2012), \"Viceroy's House\" (2017) and two \"X-Files\" films: \"The X-Files: Fight the Future\" (1998) and \"\" (2008).

Her stage work includes \"Absent Friends\" (1991) – for which she won a Theatre World Award for Best Newcomer, \"A Doll's House\" (2009) – that earned her a Laurence Olivier Award nomination, and a portrayal of Blanche DuBois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (2014, 2016) – for which she won the \"Evening Standard\" Theatre Award for Best Actress and received her second Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress. Anderson is the co-writer of \"The Earthend Saga\" novel trilogy and the self-help guide book \"WE: A Manifesto for Women Everywhere\".\n\nAnderson has been active in supporting numerous charities and humanitarian organizations. She is an honorary spokesperson for the Neurofibromatosis Network and a co-founder of South African Youth Education for Sustainability (SAYes). Anderson was appointed an honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2016 for her services to drama.\n\nAnderson was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Rosemary \"Posie\" Alyce (\"née\" Lane), a computer analyst, and Homer Edward \"Ed\" Anderson III, who owned a film post-production company. She is of English, German, and Irish ancestry. Soon after her birth, her parents moved to Puerto Rico for 15 months, then to London, England. The family relocated so that her father could attend the London Film School. During her childhood, she lived in north London's Crouch End and Harringay. She was a pupil of Coleridge Primary School. When Anderson was 11 years old, her family returned to the United States, settling in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They continued to keep a flat in London, and spent their summers there. Anderson later said that she has always intended to return to England. In Grand Rapids, she attended Fountain Elementary and City High-Middle School, a program for gifted students with a strong emphasis on the humanities.\n\nFollowing the move to Grand Rapids, Anderson went through a rebellious stage as a teenager; experimenting with drugs, dating a much older boyfriend, and cultivating a punk appearance (dyeing her hair various colors, shaving the sides of her head, sporting a nose piercing and an all-black wardrobe). She was put in therapy at the age of 14. Anderson listened to bands such as Dead Kennedys and Skinny Puppy. She was voted by her classmates as \"class clown\", \"most bizarre girl\" and \"most likely to be arrested\". She was, in fact, arrested on graduation night for breaking and entering into her high school in an attempt to glue the locks of the doors. She later managed to reduce the charges to trespassing.\n\nAt an early age Anderson was interested in marine biology, but after becoming interested in theatre during her teenage years, she began acting in high school productions during her first year and later in community theatre. She also served as a student intern at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre & School of Theatre Arts. After graduating from high school in 1986, she attended The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990. Anderson also participated in the National Theatre of Great Britain's summer program at Cornell University. To support herself financially during her student years, she worked at the Goose Island Brewpub in Chicago. After Anderson became famous, the brewery named one of their beers after her – a Belgian Style Farmhouse Ale, simply called \"Gillian\".\n\nAnderson is the eldest of three siblings. Her brother Aaron – who was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis – died in 2011 of a brain tumor, at the age of 30. Aaron was a DJ, a mentor, and a practicing Buddhist. He was in his second year of a PhD program in Developmental Psychology at Stanford University when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2008. Her sister Zoe is a ceramicist, whom Anderson calls \"an exceptional artist\". Zoe is openly gay and is married to her partner.\n\nAnderson is bidialectal. With her English accent and background, she was mocked and felt out of place as a teenager in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwestern accent. To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents. In May 2013, during an interview with BlogTalkRadio, Anderson addressed the matter of her national identity: \"I've been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don't know what the answer to that question is. I know that I feel that London is home and I'm very happy with that as my home. I love London as a city and I feel very comfortable there. In terms of identity, I'm still a bit baffled.\"\n\nAnderson moved to New York when she was 22 years old. To support herself as she started her career, she worked as a waitress. She began her career in Alan Ayckbourn's play \"Absent Friends\" at the Manhattan Theatre Club alongside Brenda Blethyn; for her role she won the 1990–91 Theatre World Award for \"Best Newcomer\". Her next theatrical role was in Christopher Hampton's \"The Philanthropist\" at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nAnderson moved to Los Angeles in 1992, and spent a year auditioning. The same year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, \"The Turning\", starring Karen Allen and Tess Harper. The film drama is an adaptation of the play \"Home Fires Burning\".\n\nAlthough she had once vowed she would never do television work, being out of work for a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: \"First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [to auditions] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't want to be involved in it.\" She broke into mainstream television in 1993, with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, \"Class of '96\", on the fledgling Fox Network.\n\nAs a result of this guest appearance, Anderson was sent the script for \"The X-Files\". She was 24 when she decided to audition because, \"for the first time in a long time, the script involved a strong, independent, intelligent woman as a lead character.\" Producer Chris Carter wanted to hire her, but Fox wanted someone with previous television exposure and greater sex appeal. Fox sent in more actresses, but Carter stood by Anderson, and she was eventually cast as FBI Special Agent Dana Scully. Anderson got the part assuming it would run for 13 episodes, the standard minimum order for American television networks. Filmed for the first five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, before moving to Los Angeles, the series ran for nine seasons. Two related films were also produced, released in 1998 and 2008. During her time on \"The X-Files\", Anderson won numerous awards for her portrayal of Special Agent Scully, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Series Drama, two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series and a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television. Anderson is the first actress to win an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a SAG Award in the same year. For the role, she received a total of four Emmy nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and nine SAG nominations.\n\nAnderson was the first woman to write and direct an episode of the \"X-Files\" (\"all things\"). During \"The X-Files\" run – between the fifth and sixth seasons – Anderson co-starred in \"\", a 1998 motion picture that continued \"The X-Files\" storyline. Anderson also provided the voice for a parody of her Scully character in \"The Springfield Files\", an episode of the animated comedy television series \"The Simpsons\". While filming the \"X-Files\", she met assistant art director Clyde Klotz, who became her first husband. Anderson's character on \"X-Files\" initiated a phenomenon referred to as \"The Scully Effect\"; as the medical doctor and the FBI Special Agent inspired many young women to pursue careers in science, medicine and law enforcement. It contributed to the increase in the number of women in those fields. \"The Scully Effect\" remains a subject of academic inquiry.\n\nIn 1996, Anderson narrated the television documentaries \"Spies Above\" and \"Why Planes Go Down\". While hosting the BBC documentary series \"Future Fantastic\", she became impressed by the theme music of the show, by the electronic duo Hal and initiated a collaboration with them. In 1997, Anderson provided spoken word vocals and starred in the music video for their single \"Extremis\", which was frequently aired on MTV. She also helped to assemble an album of electronic music, \"Future: A Journey Through The Electronic Underground\", for Virgin Records, which won praise from European music critics.\n\nIn 1997, Anderson appeared in the independent film \"Chicago Cab\". In 1998, she starred in the film \"Playing by Heart\" with Sean Connery, Angelina Jolie, Ellen Burstyn and Jon Stewart. Anderson also had a supporting role in the film \"The Mighty\" with Gena Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton, James Gandolfini and Sharon Stone. In 1999, Anderson had a supporting role in the English-language release of Hayao Miyazaki's \"Princess Mononoke\", where she voiced the character of Moro. Anderson is a fan of Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki's work. She also took part in Eve Ensler's \"The Vagina Monologues\".\n\nIn 2000, Anderson starred in the film \"The House of Mirth\" with Eric Stoltz – Terence Davies' adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel of the same name – for which she won critical acclaim and awards such as the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress, Village Voice Film Poll Best Lead Performance, and a nomination for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress.\n\nWhen \"The X-Files\" ended in 2002, she moved back to London for a complete change of pace and the opportunity to return to the stage. In 2002, Anderson made her West End debut in Michael Weller's play \"What The Night Is For\" at the Comedy Theatre. In 2004, Anderson starred in the Royal Court Theatre's production of Rebecca Gilman's play \"The Sweetest Swing in Baseball\", as artist Dana Fielding who assumes the personality of the troubled baseball player Darryl Strawberry – a role for which she earned rave reviews.\n\nIn 2005, she appeared as Lady Dedlock in the BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel \"Bleak House\". She had a starring role in the Irish film \"The Mighty Celt\", for which she won an IFTA award for Best International Actress. The same year she also appeared in \"A Cock and Bull Story\" with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon – a film version of the novel \"Tristram Shandy\".

In 2009, she starred in the British comedy film \"Boogie Woogie\" with Alan Cumming, Danny Huston and Stellan Skarsgård.\n\nShe portrayed Nora in Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" at the Donmar Warehouse in London's West End during a limited engagement which ran from May 14, 2009, until July 18, 2009. Anderson received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress, for productions which opened in the 2009 calendar year, for her portrayal of Nora.\n\nIn November 2010, Anderson portrayed Wallis, Duchess of Windsor in \"Any Human Heart\" – a television adaptation of William Boyd's novel of the same name, for which she was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress on Television. In April 2011, she starred in the BBC adaptation \"The Crimson Petal and the White\" as Mrs. Castaway, for which she was nominated for the Broadcasting Press Guild Award for Best Actress.

Between 2013 and 2015, Anderson played Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier, Hannibal Lecter's psychiatrist, on the NBC series \"Hannibal\". In 2014, Anderson was promoted from a recurring character during the first two seasons, to a series regular for the third season. In 2014, Anderson starred in the British independent science fiction film \"Robot Overlords\" alongside Sir Ben Kingsley. That year, she also appeared in Jeffrey D. Brown's drama \"Sold\", portraying Sophia, a character based on the humanitarian photographer Lisa Kristine. The film presents the issues of child trafficking and sexual slavery in India, and is based on Patricia McCormick's novel of the same name.\n\nIn July 2014, Anderson gained critical acclaim for her stage performance as Blanche DuBois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" by Tennessee Williams at the Young Vic Theatre in London. She won the \"Evening Standard\" Theatre Award for Best Actress and received her second Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress. The production became the fastest-selling show in the theatre's history, and the run was extended by two weeks due to the demand for tickets. In the first collaboration between the Young Vic Theatre and National Theatre Live, the show was broadcast live to over 1100 venues on September 16, 2014. Thus far, it has been screened in more than 2000 venues. In February 2015, Anderson directed and starred in a short film prequel to \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", titled \"The Departure\", written by novelist Andrew O'Hagan. This is part of the Young Vic's short film series, which is produced in collaboration with \"The Guardian\".\n\nIn October 2014, Anderson published her first book, \"A Vision of Fire\", co-authored with Jeff Rovin.

In 1908, when he had returned to Japan, he introduced volleyball and basketball to the country and became known as the \"Father of Japanese Basketball\". In Tokyo, the Omoris established a settlement house, \"Yurin En\" (House of the Friendly Neighbor) which offered dramatic classes and a playground for children. It also offered courses in sewing, flower arranging, cooking, and crafts as well as mother's meetings and opportunities for people to speak English.

Its first meeting was held in a local neighborhood residence. As of January 2018, the group remained active and continued to meet monthly in members' homes. The one-to-one, face-to-face method of conflict resolution, modeled by this dialogue group, was increasingly looked to globally by educators, researchers, journalists, activists, trainers, and strategists including the U.S. Department of State, which distributes the dialogue group's instructive films in Africa.\n\nMembers of the group have initiated and provided facilitation support at seminars, conferences and youth gatherings, created both printed and video facilitation guidelines, and responded to requests for media interviews. Interest in their work increased in national media during the 2000 Intifada. The group co-founders gave the 2017 Commencement Address at Notre Dame de Namur University, \"STORIES OF CHANGE: Creating a Culture of Connection in The Citizens’ Century\".\n\nInitial incentive to form the dialogue group came from coexistence models of the 1980s in the Middle East and Africa. Examples are: Neve Shalom ~ Wahat as-Salam (Oasis of Peace), a village where Jewish and Palestinian Israeli families live and learn together, and Koinonia Southern Africa, founded by Reverend Nico Smith during apartheid years, which gathered thousands of Blacks and Whites together to share meals and stories, sometimes in public at risk to their lives. Both initiatives were honored together during the San Francisco 1989 Beyond War Award Ceremony. The word Koinonia means \"belonging together\" or \"communion by intimate participation\"\n\nSeveral members of this dialogue group have deep roots in the principles and educational tradition of the Beyond War movement of the 1980s, which was succeeded by the Foundation for Global Community, the group's first fiscal sponsor. Fiscal oversight support was later provided by the Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center.\n\nIn 1991, several of the dialogue group founders, who had worked with the Beyond War Foundation and the Stanford Center on Conflict and Negotiation, brought together Palestinian and Israeli citizen leaders who forged and signed the \" \"Framework for a Public Peace Process\" \".\n\nEngaging in peacebuilding, the early Muslim, Jewish, and Christian women and men participants in the dialogue group were determined to export solutions, rather than import problems. They intended to create a people-intensive—not money-intensive—easily reproducible, in-home model to parallel and compliment the government peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as in other regions of the world. By 1993, government negotiators were clarifying their own plea for mandatory citizen participation and the need for the creativity of People-to-People Programs, as found in Annex VI of the 1993 Oslo Accords.\n\nAs designed, the living room dialogue group format gives dynamic form to the emerging paradigm of people-centered human security that challenges traditional notions of government-centered national security and is focused on sustained state, regional, and global stability.\n\nChange is viewed by the dialogue group in binary terms—a \"no\" component and a \"yes\" component. While defining the \"no\" component—what is wrong, disintegrating, and in need of correction—the dialogue's larger intention is to embody and paint a picture of the \"yes,\" The intent is to focus less on the old and the obsolete—what does not work—and more on modeling the new, the \"yes\" component that works for the good of all. The dialogue group's ongoing experience is that change begins in small circles of local innovators and Culture Creatives.\n\nThe means of Communication to strengthen relationships, release creativity, and effect change is Dialogue, with its quality of Listening for Learning. While the action of dialogue is designed to deepen and enhance circles of relationships, it is not to be mistaken for safe, casual Conversation or adversarial, win-lose Debate. Furthermore, this type of dialogue's contribution to Conflict Transformation is not in Conflict Resolution or Deliberation. Rather this type of dialogue is used to introduce, familiarize, humanize, dignify, and empathize with all the people in the room, so that Conflict Resolution and Deliberation can then take place on a solid foundation. In particular, the dialogue process begins with exploring each person's life narrative, because in many cases \"an enemy is one whose story we have not heard\". A beneficial outcome of this type of dialogue is a reduction in the widespread humiliation and rankism on Earth as defined by Robert W. Fuller.\n\nThis Track II Diplomacy approach is not a quick fix but requires time, and thus is rightfully referred to as Sustained Dialogue, as defined by Dr. Harold H. (Hal) Saunders. Useful practices of this cross-cultural communication continue to improve, drawing from the best of Bohm Dialogue, Interfaith Dialogue, and the ongoing global Dialogue Among Civilizations.\n\nThe contributions made by this dialogue group to the expanding effort to choose conversation over conflict were recognized in the Directory of Arab/Jewish/Palestinian Dialogue Groups published by the Center for Restorative Justice and Peacemaking at the University of Minnesota. Always seeking to expand the network, participants in this Dialogue Group communicate daily face-to-face and by e-mail, telephone, and Skype with citizens worldwide to encourage new groups and provide both graphic and written how-to guidelines (pdf). This dialogue group regularly publishes e-mail reports on the global success stories regarding the expanding public peace process.\n\nThe dialogue method draws on the wisdom of Elie Wiesel: \"People become the stories they hear and the stories they tell.\" Dialogue-initiated peacebuilding successes are documented in film and other tools of education that are available for community building. Documents created by the group and freely distributed for use by others include: Palestinian & Jewish Recipes for Peace, Camp Activities for Relationship Building (pdf), The Public Peace Process of Change (pdf), MEETING MOHAMMED: Beginning Jewish-Palestinian Dialogue (pdf), STORY AS ENTRY TO RELATIONSHIP: Teacher's Guide (pdf), ENGAGING THE OTHER: Teacher's Guide (pdf) and also see related Theses and documents of others. The dialogue also maintains a web resource page referencing multi-lingual graphics that can be used by other groups wanting to use dialogue as a communication tool.\n\nMany dialogue and relationship-building endeavors continue to be birthed and deepened with assistance from this dialogue group: Building Bridges in Western New York, The Dialogue Project in Brooklyn, The Houston Palestinian-Jewish Dialogue Group, Jewish-Arab Dialogues in Atlanta, Jewish-Palestinian Living Room Dialogue in San Diego, documented in the film, \"Talking Peace\", West Los Angeles Cousins Club, Monmouth Dialogue Project: Founder Saliba Sarsar, Potlucks for Peace – Ottawa, Arab/Jewish Women's Peace Coalition,Montreal Dialogue Group, and Cousins Club of Palestinians, Jews Seeks Peace.\n\nParticipation by the members of the Forward Action for Conservation of Indigenous Species.(FACIS) in the conference in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria gave this group the confidence to gather Muslim and Christian men and women for a Dialogue.\n\nA variety of films document The Dialogue Group's domestic and international experiences. Over 13,000 DVDs have been requested from all continents and every U.S. state including citizens from 2,594 institutions, 2,601 cities, in 82 nations including 20 countries in Africa.

{"id": "1633444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1633444", "title": "Karl Ludwig Sand", "text": "Karl Ludwig Sand\n\nKarl Ludwig Sand (Wunsiedel, Upper Franconia (then in Prussia), 5 October 1795 – Mannheim, 20 May 1820) was a German university student and member of a liberal Burschenschaft (student association). He was executed in 1820 for the murder of the conservative dramatist August von Kotzebue the previous year in Mannheim. As a result of his execution, Sand became a martyr in the eyes of many German nationalists seeking the creation of a united German national state.\n\nKarl Ludwig Sand was born to Gottfried Christoph Sand and his wife Dorothea Johanna Wilhelmina Schöpf (1766–1826), on 5 October 1795. His siblings were George, Fritz, Caroline and Julia.\n\nIn 1804 he attended the \"Lateinschule\" (Latin school) in Wunsiedel and in 1810 he moved on to the grammar school (\"Gymnasium\") in Hof, living with the school's rector, Georg Heinrich Saalfrank, a friend of Sand's Enlightened Protestant family. Following the closure of the Hof Gymnasium on the institution of Montgelas's Reforms, Sand followed his teacher to the Neues Gymnasium (New Grammar School) in Regensburg, completing his studies in September 1814. In November 1814 Sand matriculated at the University of Tübingen. \n\nIn 1815, Sand volunteered under Major von Falkenhausen, participating in the Battle of Waterloo in June and in Paris by July. He returned from the war disillusioned with its results and fell into a deep depression. In 1816, while at the University of Erlangen, Sand formed Burschenschaft Teutonia with his friend Dittmar, meeting at castle ruins near Erlangen which they had named Ruttli. They built a meeting house for their group of 80 students. Sand's depression was further intensified by the destruction of Ruttli by the competing political group the Landmannschaft and the drowning death of Dittmar in 1817. Starting in 1817 he studied at the University of Jena, attending the lectures of Jakob Friedrich Fries, Heinrich Luden and Lorenz Oken and joining further Burschenschaften. Sand was among the nationalist students who gathered at the 1817 Wartburg festival, in which Kotzebue's \"History of the German Empires\" was one of the books ceremoniously burned.\n\nSand already contemplated the murder of August von Kotzebue in a diary entry of 5 May 1818. He called him a \"traitor to the nation\" and a \"deceiver of the people\" and characterized him as an enemy of the Burschenschaft. \n\nOn the morning of 23 March 1819 Sand, using the pseudonym Henry, visited Kotzebue in his Mannheim house. Refused entry to the house and told to return in the afternoon, Sand returned just before five o'clock. Having exchanged just a few words with Kotzebue, Sand produced a dagger and, with the words \"Here, you traitor to the fatherland!\", stabbed him repeatedly in the chest. Surprised by Kotzebue's four-year-old son witnessing the event from the nursery, Sand lost his wits and stabbed himself. Leaving the house, he handed a servant a piece of writing he had prepared \"(\"Death to August von Kotzebue\")\", and stabbed himself again in the street. His suicide attempt failed, and he was taken to hospital.\n\nThe Mannheim \"Hofgericht\" (court of law) sentenced Sand to death on 5 May 1820. He was beheaded by Franz Wilhelm Widmann, who was the official executioner at the time.\nSand's murder of Kotzebue was a catalyst for government restrictions on liberal and German nationalist thought. On 20 September 1819 Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich called a meeting of representatives from across the German Confederation to create the Carlsbad Decrees which outlawed the Burschenschaften and put limits on freedom of the press and the rights of members of such organizations, banning them from public office, teaching or studying at universities.\n\nAlexandre Dumas, père wrote about Sand's life and published excerpts from his journals and letters in \"Karl Ludwig Sand\", part of \"Celebrated Crimes\". Prior to writing his story, Dumas visited Widmann's son in Mannheim in 1838 to gather information about Sand's character. Alexander Pushkin also memorialized Sand in his poem about assassins entitled \"Kinzhal\" (The Dagger). In Germany three films have been made concerning the events of Karl Sand's life: \"Karl Sand\" in 1964, \"Sand\" in 1971, and \"Die Unbedingten\" in 2009.\n\n\n"}

Its headquarters is in the main campus in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. It has two other campuses both in Jeddah and Al-Ahsa. All of the campuses are located inside the parameters of King Abdulaziz Medical cities, and are overseen by the Saudi National Guard Health Affairs.\n\nThe university was formally established in 2005 as a result of the positive feedback from the postgraduate programs in various medical fields that had been offered by the National Guard Health Affairs (NGHA) since the mid-1980s. The advanced medical facilities at the King Abdulaziz Medical Cities in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Ahsa proved to be critical foundations for the successful inception of the university.\n\nKSAU-HS’s main campus is in Riyadh with two additional campuses in Jeddah and Al-Ahsa. The main campus in Riyadh hosts seven colleges: College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Pharmacy, College of Public Health and Health Informatics, College of Applied Medial Sciences, College of Nursing and the College of Science & Health Professions. Jeddah Campus hosts College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Applied Medical Sciences and College of Sciences and Health Professions. Finally, Al-Ahsa Campus hosts College of Applied Medical Sciences, College of Nursing, and College of Sciences and Health Professions.\n\nThe umbrella of NGHA has given the KSAU-HS students access to King Abdulaziz Medical Cities in Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Ahsa, which are considered to be the most advanced medical complexes in the region. Furthermore, it has enabled KSAU-HS to enhance its curricula and academic programs with clinical applications and training under health professionals.\n\nThe campus is in the east of Riyadh and officially opened in April 2013. Its design is a mix of contemporary and Islamic architecture. The campus has a capacity of ten thousand students, but it can accommodate future increase in student enrolment.\n\nThere is a large landscaping area connecting the buildings with footpaths. In addition, there is a trolleybus line that connects the main areas of the campus with the housing compound.\n\nKSAU-HS has a number of agreements and memoranda for academic collaboration with reputable North American, European, and Australian universities and institutions.\n\nMemorandum of understanding with Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, for the establishment of a Collaborating Center for CanMEDS competencies in Saudi Arabia. It will serve as the hub of a network of medical educators, trainers, and faculty committed to support, develop, and facilitate CanMEDS in all domain of medical education at both undergraduate, and postgraduate levels, as well as in the professional practice. \n\nThe center will host and present a series of conferences & workshops on residency training, and develop network of medical educators, and deliver education and training to the trainees in postgraduate medical education programs in Saudi Arabia. In Nov 2010, KSAU-HS hosted The Saudi Arabian Conference on Residency Education (SACRE). This conference was a landmark event that highlighted the collaboration KSAU-HS has with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Topic discussed in the conference program included key trends in development of residency education, quality in residency program, contemporary and emerging tools for assessment of resident competence, simulation technology to teaching & learning in postgraduate medical education, teaching the domains of physician competence using the CanMEDS framework, best research in residency education, new approaches for enhancing excellence in teaching and assessment in residency, current controversies in residency education and the implications for their own program.\n\nThe Association for Medical Education in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (AMEEMR) selected King Saud bin Abdulaziz University to be its headquarters. This decision came at the Association’s 2010 General Assembly, which College of Medicine at KSAU-HS hosted. Twenty-three representatives from fifteen countries and a representative for President of World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) attended the meeting.\n\nKSAU-HS has a number of licensing agreements to develop its academic programs with prestigious universities worldwide: University of Sydney (Australia); University of Liverpool (UK); South Alabama University (USA); Flinders University (Australia); University of Arkansas (USA), Thomas Jefferson University (USA) University of Maryland (USA), Maastricht University (Netherlands), The University of Oklahoma (USA) and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (USA).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28073919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28073919", "title": "King Sejong Institute", "text": "King Sejong Institute\n\nKing Sejong Institute () is the brand name of Korean-language institutes established by the South Korean government around the world since 2007. The institute's name refers to Sejong the Great, the inventor of the Korean alphabet. As of June 2018, there were 174 King Sejong Institutes in 57 countries.\n\nHangul, the Korean alphabet, is the written form of the official Korean language and has been used by Koreans since its creation in 1446 by Sejong the Great of the Joseon Dynasty. Most Korean language learning institutions outside Korea targeted second or third generation descendants of Korean immigrants, while Korean-language learners in South Korea were mostly foreign students, migrant workers, or spouses of Koreans.\n\nThe last twenty years has seen a rise in interest and demand for the Korean language due to cultural and commercial globalisation and the Internet/Communications Revolution. International interest in Korean culture such as dramas and music has increased tremendously, especially in Asia, leading to what has been termed the \"Korean Wave\". This has been accompanied by an increase in foreign students studying in Korea. Demographically there has also been an increase in marriages between Koreans and foreigners.\n\nWith the increase in international cooperation and business, the South Korean government has been striving to standardize the names of locations, people, and other proper nouns in Hangul. Also, there was a need for more up-to-date Korean dictionaries, as most were made during the 1990s.\n\nWith such demand, the South Korean government established the concept of \"Sejonghakdang\" so as to provide integrated and standardised information and service for learning the Korean language as well as to coordinate and expand the institutes where people can learn or teach it. The Sejonghakdang will be developed as \"the\" brand commonly used by all Korean language education institutes. The South Korean government has recently launched its homepage at Sejonghakdang.org in Korean and English.\n\nSejonghakdang is represented its symbol as shown. The shape <ㅎ> symbolizes hangul and the shape on the left shoulder of ㅎ means the name and the initial of each city where the institute is located. The example here is Sejonghakdang in Seoul (Hangul: 서울), having 'ㅅ' on the left shoulder which indicates the first hangul letter of '서울'.\n\nThe South Korean government integrated the Korean Language Institutes being called with various names into one brand \"Sejonghakdang\". For a short-term strategy, the government is to encourage to use the name \"Sejonghakdang\" and the standard textbook and course, while reviewing a long-term strategy to run an integrated language institute.\n\n144 institutes have been established by the year 2016. Nine more institutes have been newly established in countries such as Latvia, Myanmar, Bahrain. In 2018, a new institute was added in the United States in Irvine, California. \nThe \"Sejonghakdang\" headquarters office was established in 2012 to systematically support the institutes around the world. The office works to be the focal point that connects the institutes around the world.\n\nNuri-Sejonghakdang is a website providing a remote education system and integrated information service related to Korean language study for Hangul learners and teachers. It is a Korean study website built jointly by various ministries within the South Korean government, including the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Ministry of Justice, and National Institute of the Korean Language, National Institute for International Education, The Overseas Koreans Foundation and International Korean Language Foundation with Presidential Council on Nation Branding as the main contributor.\n\nNuri-Sejonghakdang followed a three-step plan from 2009 to 2011 as below.\n\nNuri-Sejonghakdang provides its services to Korean language institutes throughout the world, foreigners who wish to learn the Korean language, and teachers and future teachers of the Korean language. It is still collecting and developing its contents to expand the online study courses and building multi-language versions of the website for users all around the world. The multi-language version is completed.\n\nBy the end of 2016, there were 144 institutions established in 58 countries around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

MERLOT partners and members are devoted to identifying, peer reviewing, organizing and making available existing online learning resources in a range of academic disciplines for use by higher education faculty and students.\n\nMERLOT consists of a community of staff (at The California State University, Office of the Chancellor), volunteers, and members who work together in various ways to provide users of OER (Open Educational Resource) teaching and learning materials with a wealth of services and functions that can enhance their instructional experience.\n\nThe MERLOT project began in 1997, when the California State University Center for Distributed Learning (CSU-CDL at www.cdl.edu) developed MERLOT. Under the leadership of Chuck Schneebeck, CSU-CDL's Director at the time, MERLOT was modeled after the NSF funded project, \"Authoring Tools and An Educational Object Economy (EOE)\". Led by Dr. James Spohre and hosted by Apple Computer, and other industry, university, and government collaborators, the EOE developed and distributed tools to enable the formation of communities engaged in building shared knowledge bases of learning materials.\n\nIn 1998, a State Higher Education Executives Organization/American Productivity and Quality Center (SHEEO/APQC) benchmarking study on faculty development and instructional technology selected the CSU-CDL as one of six best practices centers in North America. Visitations to the CSU-CDL by higher education institutions participating in the benchmarking students resulted in interest in collaborating with the CSU on the MERLOT project. The University of Georgia System, Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, University of North Carolina System, and the California State University System created an informal consortium representing almost one hundred campuses serving over 900,000 students and over 47,000 faculty. SHEEO was the coordinator for the cooperative of the four state systems.\n\nIn 1999, the four systems recognized the significant benefits of a cooperative initiative to expand the MERLOT collections, conduct peer reviews of the digital learning materials, and add student learning assignments. Each system contributed $20,000 in cash to develop the MERLOT software and over $30,000 in in-kind support to advance the collaborative project. The CSU maintained its leadership of and responsibilities for the operation and improvement of processes and tools.In January, 2000, the four systems sponsored 48 faculty from the disciplines of Biology, Physics, Business and Teacher Education (12 faculty from each of the four systems) to develop evaluation standards and peer review processes for online materials in the MERLOT collection.\n\nIn April, 2000, other systems and institutions of higher education were invited to join the MERLOT cooperative. In July, 2000, twenty-three (23) systems and institutions of higher education had become Institutional Partners of MERLOT. Each Institutional Partner contributed $25,000 and in-kind support for eight faculty and a project director (part-time) to coordinate MERLOT activities. The CSU continued its leadership of and responsibilities for the operation and improvement of processes and tools.\n\nIn 2009, MERLOT took over The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching's KEEP Toolkit and it became the MERLOT Content Builder. At that time, any KEEP Toolkit user who wished to maintain their web pages could become a MERLOT member and automatically have their projects migrated and hosted by MERLOT.\n\nMERLOT has been particularly influential in the development of online education and has been successful in, \"developing a professional evaluation model to promote scholarship of teaching in the universities.\" MERLOT hosts one of the world's largest collections of Open textbooks through the Open Textbook Project in collaboration with student-run Public Interest Research Groups. In addition, MERLOT has been cited as one of the most effective electronic portals for health care information.\n\nMERLOT has been influential as a model in the development of other online communities and resource repositories, including innovative collaborations with IBM and the National Learning Infrastructure Initiative (an Educause program), and as an important tool for educational reform (especially in STEM fields). MERLOT has itself become the subject of much research.\n\nMembers of MERLOT communities are vital to its success. Community Members help grow the MERLOT collection by contributing materials, and adding assignments and comments. Additionally, they introduce others in the discipline to MERLOT by presenting at conferences, authoring articles about MERLOT, and encouraging others to use and contribute to MERLOT. \nVolunteer community Members work with MERLOT staff to develop policies and practices that govern MERLOT's operations. These volunteers are member of Editorial Boards and Project Directors.\n\nEditorial boards are the cornerstones of MERLOT. They lead the development of MERLOT's discipline communities. There is one Editorial Board for each community, composed of an Editor, Associate Editors and Peer Reviewers.\n\nEditors, Associate Editors, and peer reviewers are nominated by System Partners, Campus Partners, and the MERLOT Management Team. Many peer reviewers are those who volunteer their own time to review for MERLOT. All MERLOT editorial board members are faculty with:\n\nEach editorial board is responsible for:\n\nThe MERLOT Leadership Council is composed of all of the Project Directors from System and Campus Partners, along with Editors from each of the MERLOT Discipline Communities. Project Directors have critical responsibilities in managing their institution's participation in MERLOT and MERLOT's connection to their institution's academic technology initiatives. Responsibilities of Project Directors include participation in MERLOT's governance activities, selection of Editors and editorial board members, supervision of editorial board members, and management of their institutions' partnership with MERLOT. MERLOT provides Project Directors with online tools and analytics to assist them in monitoring their members' participation in MERLOT.\n\nMembers of MERLOT are part of a variety of communities that are vital to MERLOT's success. Community members help grow the MERLOT collection by contributing materials and adding assignments and comments. Additionally, they introduce others in the discipline to MERLOT by presenting at conferences, authoring articles about MERLOT, and encouraging others to use and contribute to MERLOT. MERLOT Partners are also critical of the growth of the MERLOT community. \nThese communities are categorized as: \n\nPromoting Community Relations \nMERLOT encourages interaction among its Members by providing social networking services and functions that enable dialogue among Members. For example, MERLOT Voices is MERLOT's community networking site, that enables Members to collaborate with all MERLOT Members who are interested in joining particular communities related to the missions of MERLOT Members can join, can others to join, to participate in community conversations, customize their own Voices community webpage, and even add videos related to online learning and teaching. \nMERLOT also provides community discussion forums for every material in the collection.

According to a later paper by the authors, the following were the main conclusions of the M-Competition:\n\n\nThe findings of the study have been verified and replicated through the use of new methods by other researchers.\n\nThis is what Rob J. Hyndman, in his blog about \"A brief history of time series forecasting competitions\", had to say about the first M Competition: “… anyone could submit forecasts, making this the first true forecasting competition as far as I am aware.”\n\nNewbold (1983) was critical of the M-competition, and argued against the general idea of using a single competition to attempt to settle the complex issue.\n\nBefore the first M-Competition, Makridakis and Hibon published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society (JRSS) an article showing that simple methods perform well in comparison to the more complex and statistically sophisticated ones. Statisticians at that time criticized the results claiming that they were not possible. Their criticism motivated the subsequent M, M2 and M3 Competitions that prove beyond the slightest doubt those of the Makridakis and Hibon Study.\n\nThe second competition, called the M-2 Competition or M2-Competition, was conducted on a grander scale. A call to participate was published in the \"International Journal of Forecasting\", announcements were made in the International Symposium of Forecasting, and a written invitation was sent to all known experts on the various time series methods. The M2-Competition was organized in collaboration with four companies and included six macroeconomic series, and was conducted on a real-time basis. Data was from the United States. The results of the competition were published in a 1993 paper. The results were claimed to be statistically identical to those of the M-Competition.\n\nThe M2-Competition used much fewer time series than the original M-competition. Whereas the original M-competition had used 1001 time series, the M2-Competition used only 29, including 23 from the four collaborating companies and 6 macroeconomic series. Data from the companies was obfuscated through the use of a constant multiplier in order to preserve proprietary privacy. The purpose of the M2-Competition was to simulate real-world forecasting better in the following respects:\n\n\nThe competition was organized as follows:\n\nIn addition to the published results, many of the participants wrote short articles describing their experience participating in the competition and their reflections on what the competition demonstrated. Chris Chatfield praised the design of the competition, but said that despite the organizers' best efforts, he felt that forecasters still did not have enough access to the companies from the inside as he felt people would have in real-world forecasting.\nFildes and Makridakis (1995) argue that despite the evidence produced by these competitions, the implications continued to be ignored by theoretical statisticians.\n\nThe third competition, called the M-3 Competition or M3-Competition, was intended to both replicate \"and\" extend the features of the M-competition and M2-Competition, through the inclusion of more methods and researchers (particularly researchers in the area of neural networks) and more time series. A total of 3003 time series was used. The paper documenting the results of the competition was published in the \"International Journal of Forecasting\" in 2000 and the raw data was also made available on the International Institute of Forecasters website. According to the authors, the conclusions from the M3-Competition were similar to those from the earlier competitions.\n\nThe time series included yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, and other time series. In order to ensure that enough data was available to develop an accurate forecasting model, minimum thresholds were set for the number of observations: 14 for yearly series, 16 for quarterly series, 48 for monthly series, and 60 for other series.\n\nTime series were in the following domains: micro, industry, macro, finance, demographic, and other. Below is the number of time series based on the time interval and the domain:\n\nThe five measures used to evaluate the accuracy of different forecasts were: symmetric mean absolute percentage error (also known as symmetric MAPE), average ranking, median symmetric absolute percentage error (also known as median symmetric APE), percentage better, and median RAE.\n\nA number of other papers have been published with different analyses of the data set from the M3-Competition. According to Rob J. Hyndman, Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Forecasting (IJF), “The M3 data have continued to be used since 2000 for testing new time series forecasting methods. In fact, unless a proposed forecasting method is competitive against the original M3 participating methods, it is difficult to get published in the IJF.”\n\nThe M-Competitions have attracted great interest in both the academic literature and among practitioners, providing objective evidence of the most appropriate way of forecasting various variables of interest. The fourth competition, M4, was announced in November 2017. The competition started in Jan 1 2018 and ended in May 31 2018. Initial results were published in the [International Journal of Forecasting] on June 21, 2018. The paper can be downloaded at the [ScienceDirect website.\n\nThe M4 extended and replicated the results of the previous three competitions, using an extended and diverse set of time series to identify the most accurate forecasting method(s) for different types of predictions. It aimed to get answers on how to improve forecasting accuracy and identify the most appropriate methods for each case. To get precise and compelling answers, the M4 Competition utilized 100,000 real-life series, and incorporates all major forecasting methods, including those based on Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning, ML), as well as traditional statistical ones.\n\nIn his blog, Rob J. Hyndman said about M4: “The “M” competitions organized by Spyros Makridakis have had an enormous influence on the field of forecasting. They focused attention on what models produced good forecasts, rather than on the mathematical properties of those models. For that, Spyros deserves congratulations for changing the landscape of forecasting research through this series of competitions.\"\n\nBelow is the number of time series based on the time interval and the domain:\n\nIn order to ensure that enough data are available to develop an accurate forecasting model, minimum thresholds were set for the number of observations: 13 for yearly, 16 for quarterly, 42 for monthly, 80 for weekly, 93 for daily and 700 for hourly series.\n\nOne of its major objectives was to compare the accuracy of ML methods versus that of statistical ones and empirically verify the claims of the superior performance of ML methods.\n\nBelow is a short description of the M4 Competition and its major findings and Conclusion:\n\nThe M4 Competition ended on May 31, 2018 and in addition to point forecasts, it included specifying Prediction Intervals (PI) too. M4 was an Open one, with its most important objective (the same with that of the previous three M Competitions): “to learn to improve forecasting accuracy and advance the field as much as possible”. This is in contrast to other ones, as those organized by Kaggle, where there is actually a “horse race” aimed at identifying the most accurate forecasting method(s) without attempting to discover the reasons involved in order to be able to improve forecasting performance in the future. \n\nThe five major findings and the conclusion of M4: \n\nBelow we outline what we consider to be the five major findings of the M4 Competition and advance a logical conclusion from these findings.\n\n\nThe conclusion from the above findings is that the accuracy of individual statistical or ML methods is low and that hybrid approaches and combination of methods is the way forward in order to improve forecasting accuracy and make forecasting more valuable.\n\nThe five Machine Learning (ML) methods submitted in the M4 performed poorly, none of them being more accurate than the statistical benchmark and only one being more accurate than Naïve 2, a finding consistent with a paper published in PLOS ONE at the end of March 2018\n\nReferences\n\n\nMore information on the M4 Competition is available on the M4 website - http:/www.m4.unic.ac.cy – and a Special Issue covering all aspects of the M4, the winning methods and comment will be published in the [International Journal of Forecasting] in 2019.\n\nAlthough the organizers of the M3-Competition did contact researchers in the area of artificial neural networks to seek their participation in the competition, only one researcher participated, and that researcher's forecasts fared poorly. The reluctance of most ANN researchers to participate at the time was due to the computationally intensive nature of ANN-based forecasting and the huge time series used for the competition. In 2005, Crone, Nikolopoulos and Hibon organized the NN-3 Competition, using 111 of the time series from the M3-Competition (not the same data, because it was shifted in time, but the same sources). The NN-3 Competition found that the best ANN-based forecasts performed comparably with the best known forecasting methods, but were far more computationally intensive. It was also noted that many ANN-based techniques fared considerably worse than simple forecasting methods, despite greater \"theoretical\" potential for good performance.\n\nNassim Nicholas Taleb, in his book \"The Black Swan\", references the Makridakis Competitions as follows: \"The most interesting test of how academic methods fare in the real world was provided by Spyros Makridakis, who spent part of his career managing competitions between forecasters who practice a \"scientific method\" called econometrics -- an approach that combines economic theory with statistical measurements. Simply put, he made people forecast \"in real life\" and then he judged their accuracy. This led to a series of \"M-Competitions\" he ran, with assistance from Michele Hibon, of which M3 was the third and most recent one, completed in 1999. Makridakis and Hibon reached the sad conclusion that \"statistically sophisticated and complex methods do not necessarily provide more accurate forecasts than simpler ones.\"\"\n\nIn the book \"Everything is Obvious\", Duncan Watts cites the work of Makridakis and Hibon as showing that \"simple models are about as good as complex models in forecasting economic time series.\"\n"}

Berlitz was required by law to serve as an apprentice; he chose to work for a watchmaker for three years. He later relocated to France and then to Providence, Rhode Island, United States during 1872. His first employment was as a teacher of French and German at Warner Polytechnic College, of which he assumed control during 1878 when the owner of the school, Mr. Warner, disappeared with all the prepaid tuition money. When Berlitz became ill, and was unable to teach a French class, he quickly hired Nicholas Joly to replace him and teach the class. Since he had always corresponded with Joly in French, he did not realize that Joly did not speak any English until after he had hired him. Joly taught the class entirely in French (with no translation) by using gestures, pointing to objects and using tone of voice and facial expressions to convey meaning. Berlitz returned to the class six weeks later to find that his students, who had spoken little to no French before Joly began teaching, were conversing semi-fluently in French. Their pronunciation and grammar were also very good. Berlitz used this experience to develop the Berlitz Method, for which only the language to be taught is spoken from the first day of class. Students rely on the same techniques Joly used, rather than translation, to gather meaning and learn grammar and vocabulary.\n\nAfter success, Berlitz opened a second language school in Boston during 1880, supplemented by others in New York and Washington, D. C. He went on to establish schools all over the U.S. and in many countries abroad. Between 1880 and 1900 he also began writing about his ideas, developing them into a systematic method, which he then presented during 1900 at the World's Fair in Paris. After the end of the century, he began travelling extensively, making headlines by teaching German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II to speak English. Berlitz's fame continued to spread as he received medals of honor from the King of Spain, the government of France, and from many international expositions. He remained active until his death, aged 68, in New York City. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York.\n\nMr. Berlitz's method of language learning is still used. Many books that were originally published during the early to mid 1900's are still in print. There are also many schools that are still dedicated to continuing Mr. Berlitz's concepts regarding language learning.\n\nThe linguist and author Charles Berlitz, his grandson, was for a time the CEO of Berlitz International.\n\n"}

His play \"Sister Camille's Kaleidoscopic Cabaret\" won the Christians in Theatre Arts Full Length Play award in 1996, and premiered in Michigan in 1998.\n\nMason's first novel, \"Battered Soles\", was published by Turnstone Press in 2005. The novel celebrates a fictional pilgrimage from Peterborough, Ontario, to the small village of Lakefield, where there is, Mason asserts, a statue of a blue-skinned Jesus with healing powers in the basement of St. John's Anglican Church. \"Mason blends fiction with reality as he writes about taking this fictional pilgrimage...one weekend in July, 2003. By the time he takes this journey, it has become a mainstay tourist attraction (Swimmer 2006).\" In July 2005 the real-world rector of St. John's posted a notice advising confused tourists that there was no such statue in the basement of the church, but that \"anyone wishing an encounter with the living Christ\" should join the congregation at Sunday services. The tone of the novel is comic: \"More comedy than satire, it resounds of Horace rather than of Juvenal; Chaucer rather than Swift; Leacock rather than Richler (Gallagher 2005)\"—but there are some moments of genuine pathos. It was nominated for the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour in 2005.\n\nMason's second novel, \"The Red Dress\", was published by Turnstone in 2008. The story of a seventeen-year-old young man growing up poor and confused in rural Ontario, it is significantly darker than \"Battered Soles,\" but the ending is cautiously hopeful. \"The Red Dress\" is set in a village called Greenfield, but the landmarks and features of the community suggest that Mason has blended Lakefield, Ontario with Barriefield, just outside the city of Kingston. \"The Red Dress\" was long-listed for the 2009 ReLit award.\n\nMason's third novel, \"The Night Drummer\", was published by Vancouver's Now or Never in January 2015. It is the story of two teenage friends—white middle-class Peter Ellis, and Otis James, a native boy adopted by an evangelical Christian couple old enough to be his grandparents. Peter and Otis grow up in small town Ontario in the 1970s, and the novel follows them through their high school years. \"As Ellis sleeplessly anticipates his high school’s looming 25-year reunion, his recollections balance moments of encroaching darkness with plenty of joyous light,\" says Publishers Weekly. \"Ellis’s memories of first loves and jobs and an endearingly oddball assortment of friends, including Otis, a preternaturally wise and kind Ojibwe boy adopted by devout Caucasian parents, give this portrait a welcome sweetness that draws attention to the innocence, sheer possibility, and blithe lightheartedness of youth.\" A later review in the Autumn 2017 issue of \"The Link\" reads, \"The 1970s were a vibrant time of progressive change, and with its evocation of growing up in that wonderful era \"The Night Drummer\" makes for fascinating and entertaining reading. Highly recommended.\" The book is endorsed by former American poet laureate Billy Collins, the CBC's national correspondent Duncan McCue, and the poet Kimmy Beach.\n\nMason's work is characterized by what one reviewer calls its \"fragile optimism\" (Gallagher 2005). His plays and novels are informed by Christian belief, but are sometimes mildly profane.\n\nNow or Never published Mason's first children's book, \"A Pug Called Poppy\", in the fall of 2017.\n\nMason began a new career in 2015 as a voice-, television- and film-actor. He has roles in the feature films \"Super Detention\", \"A Witches' Ball\", \"Santa's Castle\", \"Christmas with a Prince,\" \"Hometown Holiday\", \"A Dog in Paris\", \"The Customer\", \"Behanding\", \"The Mechanical Boy\", \"Bloodslinger\", \"Darts\" and \"Speak Your Mind.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44059352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44059352", "title": "Penveu", "text": "Penveu\n\npenveu is a pen-like device developed by American company Interphase Corporation for use with digital audiovisual presentations.\n\nIn 1991, SMART Technologies introduced an Interactive Whiteboard, on which the image from a projector was displayed. A USB connection allowed the presenter to virtually interact with the projection. Other after-market products aimed at working with existing projectors, (Mimio and eBeam), came out after that.\n\nInterphase Corporation (NASDAQ:INPH) was founded in 1974, and filed for Initial Public Offering in 1984. In 2010, penveu was invented. The company developed the concepts and tested them for two years until unveiling the product at the DEMO conference in Santa Clara, California on April 18, 2012. On May 30, 2014, it was released to the market. \n\nSince the product is made of two electronic boards (one in the handheld pen and one in the base station), the engineering department named those two boards: the PEN and the VEU, a video enhancement unit. PENVEU became the name of the device.\n\nOn September 30, 2015, Interphase Corporation announced it has ceased operations and commenced bankruptcy proceedings. \n\nThe core of the penveu technology surrounds a camera located near the tip of the pen, but is implemented in two parts of the penveu system: the PEN, and the VEU. \nThe video signal (VGA) that comes from the computer towards the display device (projector or TV monitor) is intercepted by the VEU box. Over there, visual targets are inserted into that video stream. Those targets include position-encoded information, related to the location of each target within the display area. The targets are inserted as increased brightness in one frame, and reduced brightness in the next frame. Due to the flicker fusion threshold, our eyes will not be able to observe those quick changes, and since the targets in one frame will compensate for the targets in the previous frame, our eyes will only see the “target-free” visual information. The camera in the pen, on the other hand, subtracts consecutive frames. As a result, the camera will only be sensitive to the targets themselves, while ignoring the “human visible” information (the content). There is a powerful Digital signal processor (DSP) in the pen, which calculates the position of the tip based on the information retrieved from the targets detected. In the core of this technology is an engineering discipline from the area of Computer science called Computer Vision. Computer Vision is defined as “Computer vision is a field that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions”. In the penveu case, this translates into the acquisition of the positioning information through the pen camera, and extracting the position of the tip relative to the displayed image based on that information, and then the interaction with the display object at that location or the dispensing on virtual ink at the location. This camera-based technology is also assisted with a MEMS-based inertial system for better accuracy and smoother performance.\n\nAs a result of the positioning targeting system being integrated with the displayed image, penveu never requires calibration. Since the only installation required is the connection of the video (VGA) cable from the projector and computer into the penveu system, as well as USB and power—installation is very simple and does not require a professional, and the product is portable. The product works with existing projector or flat panel display, does not require a new projector, and thus is very affordable. Finally, it allows the presenter/teacher to move away from the display and “roam” around the classroom (or conference room), thus increasing interactivity between the presenter, audience, and content, increasing audience engagement.\n\nThe company was granted the first US patent (8,217,997) on 7/10/2012, a second patent (8,446,364) on 5/21/2013, a third patent (8,982,050) on March 17, 2015, a fourth patent (9,024,876) on May 5, 2015.\n\npenveu received numerous awards since its introduction into the market. First it received the “Best of InfoComm 2012” award in the “Best New Product for K-12 Education Market” category. In January 2014 it received the 2014 “Innovations in Design and Engineering” award at the Consumer Electronics Show in the “Computer Peripherals” category. Later in June 2014 it received the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) inaugural Best of Show” award. Finally, in September 2014 the penveu team was a finalist in the Tech Titans event at the Technology Inventor category.\n"}

He is a former headmaster of The King's School, Parramatta, stepping down from the post in 2017 after serving in the role for almost 20 years.\n\nBorn in Adelaide, South Australia in 1953, Hawkes' initial education was at Bordertown Primary and at the Woomera Area School. Because the family moved overseas, Hawkes completed his secondary education as a boarder at The King's School, Rochester in England where he became school captain. He undertook undergraduate studies at Durham University, England, graduating with a BEd (Hons) in 1975. He had a particular talent for sport, playing rugby for the University and participating in athletics at county level. While at university, Hawkes also participated in the 1973 British Undergraduates Expedition to the Jotenheim region of Norway and worked with opium and heroin drug addicts at the \"Society of St. Stephen\" in Hong Kong. After teaching at Loughborough Grammar School for five years, Hawkes returned to Australia in 1981 to teach at Knox Grammar School in Sydney, where he eventually became Senior Boarding Master. It was during this time that a sexual assault (by another person) on a child under his care was not reported to police. He undertook postgraduate studies at Macquarie University in Sydney where he obtained his PhD in May 1988. His thesis reflected his main teaching discipline which was Geography and was entitled 'A study of factors influencing children's ability to recognize features on black and white aerial photographs.' Hawkes also completed a Graduate Diploma in Education Administration at the University of New England\n\nHawkes met his wife, Jane, at Durham University in England and they have three adult children.\n\nIn 1989, Hawkes accepted the position of Principal of St Leonard's College, Melbourne, a co-educational independent school. During his time at St Leonard's, Hawkes engaged in a vigorous building program and raised enrolments from 1200 to nearer 1500. He also became the founding Chairman of the Heads of Independent Co-educational Schools of Victoria and was instrumental in establishing the Association of Co-Educational Schools sporting competition. Following on from a re-vitalisation of the International Baccalaureate program at St Leonard's, Hawkes served as a heads of school representative on the governing board of the International Baccalaureate Organisation.\n\nIn 1998, Hawkes moved to Sydney to become headmaster of The King's School, an independent, Anglican, day and boarding school for boys and Australia's oldest independent school. Soon after joining King's, he featured in the ABC documentary about the school and its new headmaster entitled 'King's School.' While at King's, Hawkes has rebuilt much of the School and has been an active contributor at many educational conferences both in Australia and overseas, including being a keynote speaker at the Headmaster's Conference (HMC) of Great Britain in 2003. His main focus is on the education of boys, and more recently the teaching of leadership skills to students. His works are largely confined to primary and secondary level education but he also comments on broader matters of social interest. His more recently published works include \"Blizzard Lines\", a novel that explores the relationship between a father and a son.\n\nDuring the 1998, 2001 and 2004 Australian federal elections, Hawkes became an active participant in the national discussion on education with The King's School being frequently cited by the Australian Labor Party as an exemplar of a well-funded private school in receipt of significant government funding. Hawkes defended the right of independent schools, even well-resourced schools, to receive at least some government funding. This continued into the 2007 election.\n\nHawkes has made a strong contribution to educational debate. As the founding chair of the Australian Boarding Schools' Association, he has written \"Duty of Care\" the major training course for boarding staff used in Australia and has advanced the cause of boarding in the media. A major authority on boys' education, Hawkes has been an advisor to the federal government, serving as a member of the \"Forum on the Education of Boys\" in 2002. His book \"Boy Oh Boy\" has become a best seller and Hawkes continues to write and speak extensively on the issue of educating boys.\n\nHawkes has been active in the area of values education and the development of leadership skills in students. His four book series \"Learning Leadership\" – a leadership training course for students- has become popular in many schools throughout the world. Several articles have been written by Hawkes advocating the teaching of leadership and values in schools.\n\nNo stranger to controversy, Hawkes has been a strong defender of independent education. In 2005, then-Federal Education Minister Brendan Nelson raised the prospect of teaching intelligent design in science classes, but quickly retreated to declare that religion or philosophy classes would be the only appropriate venue. The Australian chapter of Campus Crusade for Christ distributed a DVD of the Discovery Institute's documentary \"Unlocking the Mystery of Life\" (2002) to Australian secondary schools. Prominent scientific and educational organisations including the Australian Academy of Science, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, and the Australian Science Teachers' Association published an open letter urging that \"the teaching or promulgation of intelligent design as science\" should be prohibited, and that allowing such materials into school classrooms \"would make a mockery of Australian science teaching and throw open the door of science classes to similarly unscientific world views – be they astrology, spoon bending, flat Earth cosmology or alien abductions.\" Within a week of this open letter being published, Hawkes declared his support for using the DVD in the classroom at the discretion of teachers and principals, stating that are undeniable weaknesses within Darwin's Theory of Evolution, and these must be acknowledged honestly\"; he added that the DVD being \"forever shackled\" and restricted to only the context of religious education would be a shame as teachers should be able to use it in science classes and other areas where theories and their underlying scientific assumptions are explored. The debate on intelligent design resulted in Hawkes being nominated for the Bent Spoon Award of the Australian Skeptics organisation in 2006; Nelson had been nominated 17 times when the organisation decided not to accept any further nominations for him. Neither of them won the award.\n\nIn 2007, Hawkes was given a \"quality teaching\" federal government award for excellence as a school principal for \"rejuvenating the educational philosophy and practice of The King's School by building on its strengths as a national leader in boys' education, residential education and leadership education. School results have significantly improved under his leadership\".\n\nHawkes has a number of interests outside education including being patron of the \"Foresight Foundation\" an organisation that assists adults who are both deaf and blind. He served from 2000 to 2008 as the national chairman of Overseas Missionary Fellowship and is president of the \"Under 16s\", an organisation that supports those who volunteered while being under the age of 16 years for service in World War II.\n\n the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse is conducting public hearings (commenced on 23 February 2015) concerning the response of Knox Grammar, and the Uniting Church, to complaints and criminal proceedings involving teachers who sexually abused students. Hawkes appeared to give testimony on the \"Balaclava Man\" incident. Comments he made while leaving the commission were subject to media and public reaction.\n\n"}

The full suite of Ultralingua language tools is available free online without the need for download and installation. \nAs well as its online products, the developer offers premium downloadable language software with extended features and content for Macintosh and Windows computer platforms, smartphones, and other hand held devices.\n\nIn addition to the main user interface of the electronic dictionary, a ‘hotkey’ feature allows the user to click on a word in any program that uses editable text including web browsers and PDF documents, and source code. When a word is clicked, the translation or definition is displayed in a small pop-up window. The hotkey tool does not require previous launching of the software application.\nThe word stemming function allows searches from inflected forms of a word into the root word, such as in French, (\"allez\" → \"aller\") with further extension by lemmatisation. Full verb conjugation in all tenses, and number conversion from digits to text in the available languages (e.g. \"123\" → \"one hundred twenty-three\"), are available through the program interface, as well as free access to online examples of language in use, and a discussion forum moderated by linguists and lexicographers.\n\nThe search algorithms are tolerant of capitalisation, minor misspelling, and omitted accents and diacritics. Extensive lexical information is provided including irregular plurals, irregular verb forms, phrases and examples of use, American English and British English variations, and grammar references. IPA transcription is given, while several language modules are also enabled for text-to-speech.\nThe application interface can be either permanently displayed above or alongside any other open program windows, or allowed to ‘float’ above open windows and is resizable.\n\nAn integrated learning tool provides a full screen flashcard feature that can work with the words in the language databases, and user-added definitions.\n\nThe concept of the Ultralingua dictionary software began in 1996 when a small group of professors from Carleton College had the idea of creating a French dictionary that allowed the user to look up words on the fly with drag-and-drop technology, to and from a work in progress.\n\nThe dictionary program was first developed for the Apple Macintosh only. It was launched as freeware in 1997 under the name of \"Le Francophile\" and distributed mainly on the cover floppy discs of Mac magazines. It was commercialised in 1999 as shareware as a fully functional application that could be obtained online from download sites. By the year 2000, with the collaboration of additional specialists in lexicography and linguistics, the product range had expanded to include language modules for Spanish and German, and was released for Windows. A French-German module was added in 2002.\n\nConcurrent with the opening of the Apple App Store in 2008, the language tools were launched for the iPhone.\nThe major languages and features of the dictionary program have been offered free online since 2005 and take into account all the improvements of regular releases. \nBy 2009 the software package was offering 17 dictionaries and additional language tools for widely spoken world languages.\n\nVersion 7.1.4 (Mac) and version 7.0.0.0 (Windows), released in the fall of 2008 and May 2009 respectively, incorporated a completely redesigned GUI and addressed many of the suggestions for improvement made in an exhaustive independent evaluation of version 6.0 by the State University of Texas (CALICO).\n\nThough many people have been involved in the development of Ultralingua's code and data, the founders and main contributors to its development are the Chair Professors of Carleton's Linguistics and Computer Science departments. Elements of Ultralingua software have been developed in collaboration with Princeton University, and The Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary, by Carnegie Mellon University. Additional code libraries used include contributions by CTGradient, ShortcutRecorder (BSD License), PTHotKey, Sparkle for application updates, and the hotkey code includes software licensed from TrufSoft.com.\n\nFrom its own in-house lexicographers the software provides proprietary bilingual dictionary modules for French-English, Spanish-English, German-English, Italian-English, Portuguese-English, Norwegian-English, French-Spanish, French-Italian, French-German, Spanish-German, Spanish-Portuguese, Esperanto-English, Latin-English, and English and French monolingual dictionaries and thesauri.\n\nAs well as its own language data sets, third-party modules include an English-French medical dictionary licensed from Masson, the French division of Elsevier, the world's largest publisher of medical and scientific literature, an English-Klingon dictionary developed in collaboration with the Klingon Language Institute and Simon & Schuster, and bilingual corpora developed in association with HarperCollins. The co-branded Dictionaries from Collins, Masson, and Simon & Schuster are for use exclusively with Ultralingua software.\n\nThe developer also has agreements with McGraw-Hill and Hachette for publication and distribution of print and CD-ROM versions of its dictionaries.\n\nOther programs separately available that are based on the Ultralingua technology include Grammatica, a spell and grammar check utility, and Distinguo, an API for semantic search.\n\nIt has been suggested in an independent evaluation by CALICO headquartered at the State University of Texas that the lexical content of the dictionaries tested with version 6.0 (2006) fell short on several issues: namely that the lack of systematic information on usage, regional variants, and examples in context diminished to a certain extent the value of these tools; and that entries needed to be organized into coherent and easily identifiable sections, with priority given to primary meanings between the language 1 and language 2. So, too, cultural and geographical entries included in the monolingual dictionaries needed to be expanded to cover all countries in which the language is spoken. The evaluation went on to state that despite their shortcomings, which decrease each time a new version is released, given the size of each of the dictionaries, the entries are reasonably comprehensible and offer useful information for language learners, particularly in the dictionaries with more complete databases.\n\nMac OS X,10.3.+ ; Windows 2000, NT, XP, Vista, Windows 7; Windows Mobile; Palm OS; Pocket PC; Smartphone; iPhone; Symbian\n\n"}
