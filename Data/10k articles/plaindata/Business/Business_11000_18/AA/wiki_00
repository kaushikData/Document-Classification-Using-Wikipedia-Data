It was completed in 1983 and has 41 floors. The building cost US$10 million, has of floor area, has 24 elevators, and is the 89th tallest building in New York. Edward Larrabee Barnes & Associates designed the building, and IBM developed it. IBM sold the tower to Odyssey in 1994. As of December 2007, 98% of the building is leased.\n\nThe world headquarters of IBM had been in a previous 20-story building on this site which opened in January 1938. IBM moved its headquarters to Armonk, New York in 1964 but still needed a facility in New York City. In 1973, the construction of a new IBM building to replace the existing one was permitted by New York City. Its plan included square footage exceeded the legal limitation of allowable floor area but it was accepted because of the bonus for providing benefits of public open space. The original building was demolished starting in 1977. The present building was completed in 1983. It contained public open space as part of a 1961 amendment to the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which allowed architects to create buildings with more square footage if they contained public open spaces.\n\nThe building was used by IBM as its Eastern regional headquarters until it was sold to Odyssey in 1994. In following year, the new owner applied to the City Planning Commission for the modification proposal of its atrium. After hearing of arguments for and against the proposal, the public space was altered. Although there were some changes in the atrium such as the removal of a few bamboo trees, additional chairs, and displays of sculpture, it still kept the designation as an oasis in the city. The building and its atrium have been known as one of the most monumental buildings and popular open spaces in the city.\n\n590 Madison Avenue is an office building designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes. It was originally owned by IBM and thus called the \"IBM Building\". The tower was completed in 1983, and was used by numerous IBM branch offices until it was sold to Odyssey in 1994. The building is still named for IBM, and the global technology firm remains a major tenant. The 41-story building's height reaches 603 feet (184 m). It has a unique wedge shape and an adjacent, privately owned public space covered by a glass structure, which contains resting chairs, tables, and bamboo trees, and is used for pedestrian circulation, resting, amenities, art displays and cultural events.\n\nThe building is located on the west side of Madison Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets. The Trump Tower, and the Sony Building, nearby, also have public spaces. This context strongly influenced the design of the building. Its wedge shape was intended to avoid too much volume of the building toward 56th Street, which is a relatively narrow street. Instead, Barnes faced the building toward 57th Street and Madison Avenue directly without setback. The space saved by cutting the South West corner of the building allowed the creation of open space at ground level. The open space is connected to 5th Avenue through the atrium in the Trump Tower. Also, a pedestrian arcade is across the block and creates circulation from 57th Street through 56th Street to the Sony Building. The open space of the IBM building not only provides the space to escape from density but also activates the circulation in this area.\n\nThe building was designed as a unique wedge shape, having the South West corner cut from the rectangular box. The volume can be seen differently from different angles, sometimes slender, sometimes gigantic. The entrance of the building provides spectacle and openness to the street and welcoming visitors. Of the building's 41 stories, most are assigned to office use. At ground level, some retail stores face 57th Street. The building occupies only 40 percent of the property and the rest of the square footage is assigned to public open space. The space is filled with a series of amenities such as food and drink kiosks, tables and chairs, receptacles, etc. Green bamboo trees installed in the space celebrate the serenity of an indoor garden. Also, artwork is displayed inside to entertain visitors. This space is occasionally used for special events.\nThe exterior of the building is covered by gray green glass and polished granite. The moderately reflective surface keeps changing its texture depending on the angle and the light. The use of transparent glass for the public space emphasizes its openness and lets plenty of sunlight in. The wedge shaped building was a challenge in terms of structure because its shape caused more wind load than that to conventional box shaped skyscrapers. After wind tunnel tests, the original structural design was revised because of the wind load. The frames around the elevator shafts remained as they were, with diagonal frames added. Columns on the perimeter of the building were moved closer by half and the spandrel beams were strengthened. Surprisingly, after redesign of the structure, the total amount of steel required decreased. Another interesting challenge in the structure's design was the cantilevered entrance. The challenge was not how to support the load above, but how to keep the stability of the building. Using stronger and bigger columns for the base solved this problem.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "224094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=224094", "title": "Adbusters", "text": "Adbusters\n\nThe Adbusters Media Foundation is a Canadian-based not-for-profit, pro-environment organization founded in 1989 by Kalle Lasn and Bill Schmalz in Vancouver, British Columbia. Adbusters describes itself as \"a global network of artists, activists, writers, pranksters, students, educators and entrepreneurs who want to advance the new social activist movement of the information age.\"\n\nCharacterized by some as anti-capitalist or opposed to capitalism, it publishes the reader-supported, advertising-free \"Adbusters\", an activist magazine with an international circulation of 120,000 by the late 2000s devoted to challenging consumerism. Past and present contributors to the magazine include Jonathan Barnbrook, Morris Berman, Brendan Connell, Simon Critchley, David Graeber, Michael Hardt, Chris Hedges, Bill McKibben, Jim Munroe, David Orrell, Douglas Rushkoff, Matt Taibbi, Slavoj Žižek, and others.\n\nAdbusters has launched numerous international campaigns, including Buy Nothing Day, TV Turnoff Week and Occupy Wall Street, and is known for their \"subvertisements\" that spoof popular advertisements. In English, Adbusters has bi-monthly American, Canadian, Australian, UK and International editions of each issue. Adbusters's sister organizations include \"Résistance à l'Aggression Publicitaire\" and \"Casseurs de Pub\" in France, \"Adbusters Norge\" in Norway, \"Adbusters Sverige\" in Sweden and \"Culture Jammers\" in Japan.\n\nAdbusters was founded in 1989 by Kalle Lasn and Bill Schmalz, a duo of award-winning documentary filmmakers living in Vancouver. Since the early 1980s, Lasn had been making films that explored the spiritual and cultural lessons the West could learn from the Japanese experience with capitalism.\n\nIn 1988, the \"British Columbia Council of Forest Industries,\" the \"voice\" of the logging industry, was facing tremendous public pressure from a growing environmentalist movement. The logging industry fought back with a television ad campaign called \"Forests Forever.\" It was an early example of greenwashing: shots of happy children, workers and animals with a kindly, trustworthy sounding narrator who assured the public that the logging industry was protecting the forest.\n\nLasn and Shmalz, outraged by the use of the public airwaves to deliver what they felt was deceptive anti-environmentalist propaganda, responded by producing the \"Talking Rainforest\" anti-ad in which an old-growth tree explains to a sapling that \"a tree farm is not a forest.\" But the duo proved to be unable to buy airtime on the same stations that had aired the forest-industry ad. According to a former Adbusters employee, \"The CBC's reaction to the proposed television commercial created the real flash point for the Media Foundation. It seemed that Lasn and Schmaltz's commercial was too controversial to air on the CBC. An environmental message that challenged the large forestry companies was considered 'advocacy advertising' and was disallowed, even though the 'informational' messages that glorified clearcutting were OK.\"\n\nThe foundation was born out of their belief that citizens do not have the same access to the information flows as corporations. One of the foundation's key campaigns continues to be the Media Carta, a \"movement to enshrine The Right to Communicate in the constitutions of all free nations, and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\"\n\nThe foundation notes that concern over the flow of information goes beyond the desire to protect democratic transparency, freedom of speech or the public's access to the airwaves. Although it supports these causes, the foundation instead situates the battle of the mind at the center of its political agenda. Fighting to counter pro-consumerist advertising is done not as a means to an end, but as the end in itself. This shift in emphasis is a crucial element of mental environmentalism.\n\nThe subtitle of \"Adbusters\" magazine is \"The Journal of the Mental Environment.\"\n\nIn a 1996 interview, Kalle Lasn explained the foundation's goal:\nWhat we're trying to do is pioneer a new form of social activism using all the power of the mass media to sell ideas, rather than products. We're motivated by a kind of 'greenthink' that comes from the environmental movement and isn't mired in the old ideology of the left and right. Instead, we take the environmental ethic into the mental ethic, trying to clean up the toxic areas of our minds.\n\nYou can't recycle and be a good environmental citizen, then watch four hours of television and get consumption messages pumped at you.\n\nAdbusters describes itself as anti-advertising: it blames advertising for playing a central role in creating and maintaining consumer culture. This argument is based on the belief that the advertising industry goes to great effort and expense to associate desire and identity with commodities. Adbusters believes that advertising has unjustly \"colonized\" public, discursive and psychic spaces, by appearing in movies, sports and even schools, so as to permeate modern culture. Adbusters's stated goals include combating the negative effects of advertising and empowering its readers to regain control of culture, encouraging them to ask \"Are we consumers and citizens?\"\n\nSince \"Adbusters\" concludes that advertising conditions people to look to external sources, to define their own personal identities, the magazine advocates a \"natural and authentic self apart from the consumer society\". The magazine aims to provoke anti-consumerist feelings. By juxtaposing text and images, the magazine attempts to create a means of raising awareness and getting its message out to people that is both aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.\n\nActivism also takes many other forms such as corporate boycotts and ‘art as protest', often incorporating humor. This includes billboard modifications, google bombing, flash mobs and fake parking tickets for SUVs. A popular example of cultural jamming is the distortion of Tiger Woods' smile into the form of the Nike swoosh, calling viewers to question how they view Woods' persona as a product. Adbusters calls it \"trickle up\" activism, and encourages its readers to do these activities by honoring culture jamming work in the magazine. In the September/October 2001 \"Graphic Anarchy\" issue, Adbusters were culture jammed themselves in a manner of speaking: they hailed the work of Swiss graphic designer Ernst Bettler as \"one of the greatest design interventions on record\", unaware that Bettler's story was an elaborate hoax.\n\n\"Media Carta\" is a charter challenging the corporate control of the public airwaves and means of communication. The goal is to \"make the public airwaves truly public, and not just a corporate domain.\" Over 30,000 people have signed the document voicing their desire to reclaim the public space.\nOn 13 September 2004, Adbusters filed a lawsuit against six major Canadian television broadcasters (including CanWest Global, Bell Globemedia, CHUM Ltd., and the CBC) for refusing to air Adbusters videos in the television commercial spots that Adbusters attempted to purchase. Most broadcasters refused the commercials, fearing the ads would upset other advertisers as well as violate business principles by \"contaminating the purity of media environments designed exclusively for communicating commercial messages\". The lawsuit claims that Adbusters' freedom of expression was unjustly limited by the refusals. Adbusters believes the public deserves a right to be presented with viewpoints that differ from the standard. Under Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, television is a public space allowing ordinary citizens to possess the same rights as advertising agencies and corporations to purchase 30 seconds of airtime from major broadcasters. There has been talk that if Adbusters wins in Canadian court, they will file similar lawsuits against major U.S. broadcasters that also refused the advertisements. CNN is the only network that has allowed several of the foundation's commercials to run.\n\nOn 3 April 2009, the British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously overturned a BC Supreme Court ruling that had dismissed the case in February 2008. The court granted Adbusters the ability to sue the Canadian Broadcasting Company and CanWest Global, the corporations that originally refused to air the anti-car ad \"Autosaurus\". The ruling represents a victory for Adbusters, but it is the first step of their intended goal, essentially opening the door for future legal action against the media conglomerates. Kalle Lasn declared the ruling a success and said, \"After twenty years of legal struggle, the courts have finally given us permission to take on the media corporations and hold them up to public scrutiny.\"\n\nIn April 2009, the foundation transformed TV Turnoff Week into Digital Detox Week, encouraging citizens to spend seven days \"unplugged\" without any of electronic devices such as video-game systems and computers.\n\nThe \"One Flag\" competition encouraged readers to create a flag that symbolized \"global citizenship\", without using language or commonly known symbols.\n\nCulture jamming is the primary means through which Adbusters challenges consumerism. The magazine was described by Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter in their book \"The Rebel Sell\" as \"the flagship publication of the culture jamming movement.\" Culture jamming is heavily influenced by the Situationist International and the tactic of \"détournement\". The goal is to interrupt the normal consumerist experience in order to reveal the underlying ideology of an advertisement, media message, or consumer artifact. Adbusters believe large corporations control mainstream media and the flow of information, and culture jamming aims to challenge this as a form of protest. The term \"jam\" contains more than one meaning, including improvising, by re-situating an image or idea already in existence, and interrupting, by attempting to stop the workings of a machine.\n\nAs already noted, the foundation's approach to culture jamming has its roots in the activities of the situationists and in particular their concept of \"détournement\". This involves the \"turning around\" of received messages so that they communicate meanings at variance with their original intention. Situationists argue that consumerism creates \"a limitless artificiality\", blurring the lines of reality and detracting from the essence of human experience. In the \"culture jamming\" context, \"détournement\" means taking symbols, logos and slogans that are considered to be the vehicles upon which the \"dominant discourse\" of \"late capitalism\" is communicated and changing them – frequently in significant but minor ways – to subvert the \"monologue of the ruling order\" [Debord].\n\nThe foundation's activism links grassroots efforts with environmental and social concerns, hoping followers will \"reconstruct [their] self through nonconsumption strategies.\" The foundation is particularly well known for its culture jamming campaigns, and the magazine often features photographs of politically motivated billboard or advertisement vandalism sent in by readers. The campaigns attempt to remove people from the \"isolated reality of consumer comforts\".\n\nIn 2004, the foundation began selling vegan, indy shoes. The name and logo are \"open-source\"; in other words, unencumbered by private trademarks. Attached to each pair was a \"Rethink the Cool\" leaflet, inviting wearers to join a movement, and two spots – one for drawing their own logos and another on the toe for \"kicking corporate ass.\"\n\nThere are three versions of the Blackspot Sneaker. The V1 is designed to resemble the Nike-owned Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars (Nike bought Converse in 2003). There is also a V1 in \"fiery red.\"\n\nThe V2 is designed by Canadian shoe designer John Fluevog. It is made from organic hemp and recycled car tires.\n\nAfter an extensive search for anti-sweatshop manufacturers around the world, Adbusters found a small union shop in Portugal. The sale of more than twenty-five thousand pairs through an alternative distribution network is an example of Western consumer activism marketing.\n\nAdbusters describes its goals vis-à-vis Blackspot as follows:\n\nHeath and Potter's \"The Rebel Sell\", which is critical of Adbusters, claimed that the blackspot shoe's existence proves that \"no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' culture.\"\n\nIn the June 2008 cover story of \"BusinessWeek Small Business Magazine\", the Blackspot campaign was among three profiled in a piece focusing on \"antipreneurs.\" Two advertising executives were asked to review the campaign for the article's \"Ask the Experts\" sidebar. Brian Martin of \"Brand Connections\" and Dave Weaver of TM Advertising both gave the campaign favorable reviews.\n\nMartin noted that Blackspot was effectively telling consumers, \"We know we are marketing to you, and you are as good as we are at this, and your opinion matters,\" while Weaver stated that \"This is not a call to sales of the shoe so much as it is a call to participate in the community of Adbusters by buying the shoe.\"\n\nIn mid-2011, Adbusters Foundation proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent global financial crisis. They sought to combine the symbolic location of the 2011 protests in Tahrir Square with the consensus decision making of the 2011 Spanish protests. Adbusters' senior editor Micah White said they had suggested the protest via their email list and it \"was spontaneously taken up by all the people of the world.\" Adbusters' website said that from their \"one simple demand—a presidential commission to separate money from politics\" they would \"start setting the agenda for a new America.\" They promoted the protest with a poster featuring a dancer atop Wall Street's iconic Charging Bull. On 13 July 2011 it was the staff at the magazine that created the #OCCUPYWALLSTREET hashtag on Twitter.\n\nWhile the movement was started by Adbusters, the group does not control the movement, and it has since grown worldwide.\n\nThe foundation has been criticized for having a style and form that are too similar to the media and commercial product that adbusters attack, that its high gloss design makes the magazine too expensive, and that a style over substance approach is used to mask sub-par content.\n\nHeath and Potter posit that the more alternative or subversive the foundation feels, the more appealing the Blackspot sneaker will become to the mainstream market. They believe consumers seek exclusivity and social distinction and have argued that the mainstream market seeks the very same brand of individuality that the foundation promotes; thus they see the foundation as promoting capitalist values.\n\nThe Blackspot Shoes campaign has stirred heated debate, as Adbusters admits to using the same marketing technique which it denounces other companies for using by originally purchasing much advertising space for the shoe.\n\nAdbusters launched a legal challenge in 1995. A second in 2004 was against CBC, CTV, CanWest and CHUM, for refusing to air anti-consumerism commercials, therefore infringing on the staff's freedom of speech. In one case, a CHUM representative is quoted as saying the ads \"were so blatantly against television and that is our entire core business. You know we can't be selling our airtime and then telling people to turn their TVs off.\"\n\nIn March 2004, \"Adbusters\" was accused of antisemitism after running an article titled \"Why won't anyone say they are Jewish?\" The article compiled a list of neoconservative supporters within the Bush Administration and marked the names of those it perceived as Jewish with a black dot. It questioned why, given Israel's role, the political implications of this Jewish neoconservative influence on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East were not a subject of debate.\n\nIn October 2010, Shopper's Drug Mart pulled \"Adbusters\" off of its shelves after a photo montage comparing the Gaza Strip to the Warsaw ghetto was featured in an article critiquing Israel's embargo of Gaza. The Canadian Jewish Congress rallied to have the magazine blacklisted from bookstores, accusing \"Adbusters\" of trivializing the Holocaust and of antisemitism. In response \"Adbusters\" argued that the charge of antisemitism was being used to silence what it considered legitimate criticism of Israeli policies.\n\nSome critics claim that culture jamming does little to incite real difference. Others declare the movement an easy way for upper- and middle-class citizens to feel empowered by engaging in activism that bears no personal cost, such as the campaign \"Buy Nothing Day\". These critics feel a need for \"resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its symptoms\".\n\nIn 1999, Adbusters won the award for National Magazine of the Year in Canada.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "794129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=794129", "title": "Adolphus Busch", "text": "Adolphus Busch\n\nAdolphus Busch (10 July 1839 – 10 October 1913) was the German-born co-founder of Anheuser-Busch with his father-in-law, Eberhard Anheuser. He introduced numerous innovations, building the success of the company in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He became a philanthropist, using his great wealth for education and humanitarian needs. His great-great-grandson, August Busch IV is now on the board of Anheuser-Busch InBev.\n\nBusch was born on July 10, 1839, to Ulrich Busch and Barbara Pfeiffer in Kastel, then a district of Mainz in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. He was the twenty-first of twenty-two children. His wealthy family ran a wholesale business of winery and brewery supplies. Busch and his brothers all received quality educations, and he graduated from the Collegiate Institute of Belgium in Brussels.\n\nIn 1857, at the age of 18, Busch emigrated with three of his older brothers to St. Louis, Missouri which was a major destination for German immigrants in the nineteenth century. Because he had so many siblings, Adolphus did not expect to inherit much of his father's estate and had to make his own way. Since St. Louis was home to so many German immigrants, the market for beer was large. The city also had two natural resources essential for manufacturing and storing beer in that time, before refrigeration: the river provided an ample water supply; and the city had many caves that would keep beer cool.\n\nHis brother Johann established a brewery in Washington, Missouri. Ulrich Jr. married a daughter of Eberhard Anheuser in St. Louis, and settled in Chicago. Anton was a hops dealer who later returned to Mainz.\n\nBusch's first job in St. Louis was working as a clerk in the commission house. He was also an employee at William Hainrichshofen's wholesale company. During the American Civil War Busch served in the Union Army for six months. During this period, he learned that his father had died and he had inherited a portion of the estate.\n\nBusch partnered with Ernst Battenberg in St. Louis to found the first of his businesses, a brewing supply company that sold to the three dozen breweries in the city. Eberhard Anheuser was one of Adolphus' customers. Anheuser was a soap manufacturer that lent money to the Bavarian Brewery. When the small brewery went bankrupt, Anheuser bought out the other creditors and renamed the company Anheuser. Adolphus married Eberhard's daughter Lilly in 1861.\n\nReturning to St. Louis after the Civil War, Busch entered his wife's family's brewery business. He bought out Eberhard's partner, William D'Oench. In 1879, the company was renamed Anheuser-Busch.\n\nAt the death of Eberhard Anheuser in 1880, Busch became president of the business, and became wealthy due to the success of the brewery. He envisioned a national beer with universal appeal. His work was distinguished by his \"timely adoption of important scientific and technological innovations, an expansive sales strategy geared largely toward external domestic and international population centers, and a pioneering integrated marketing plan that focused on a single core brand, Budweiser, making it the most successful nationally-distributed beer of the pre-Prohibition era.\"\n\nTo build Budweiser as a national beer, Busch created a network of rail-side ice-houses and launched the industry's first fleet of refrigerated freight cars. However, throughout his life, he jokingly referred to his beer as \"dot schlop\" and preferred wine to drink.\n\nWhen Busch implemented pasteurization (1878) as a way to keep the beer fresh for longer, his company was able to profit from shipping beer across the country. Busch soon acquired breweries in Texas which allowed his operation to distribute to Mexico and California. Busch was an early adopter of bottled beer and founded the Busch Glass Company to make bottles for his product. In 1901 sales surpassed the one million barrels of beer benchmark.\n\nIn addition to pasteurization and refrigeration, Busch was an early adopter of vertical integration, or buying all components of a business. He bought bottling factories, ice-manufacturing plants, stave makers, timberland, coal mines, and a refrigeration company. He also bought railways and bought the rights from Rudolf Diesel to assemble diesel engines in America. The Busch family also acquired hop farms in the area near Cooperstown, New York.\n\nHis focus on the business extended to the flavor of the beer itself. Carl Conrad held the trademark for the name Budweiser and had Anheuser-Busch manufacture it for him. Conrad was an importer of wines and champagnes. Busch studied the pilsner process in Europe, which was used for brewing Budweiser. Adolphus bought the rights to Budweiser from Conrad in October 1882 when Conrad went bankrupt.\n\nBusch served as the president of the South Side Bank and the Manufacturers Railway. He had helped organize the latter as a short-line rail serving local industry. He also was a director of the Louisiana Purchase Company. Like other business leaders, he served as a director of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, contributing to civic efforts.\n\nBusch invested in new buildings and businesses in Dallas, Texas, which was growing rapidly in the early 20th century as an industrial city. In 1912, Busch constructed the Adolphus Hotel there as the tallest building in the state. Another was the Busch Building, which has been adapted as the Kirby Residences, and is located at 1509 Main St. It is a National Historic Landmark.\n\nFrom his early years, Busch contributed generously to charitable and education needs. With a lifelong interest in his homeland, he assisted in repairing devastation from the 1882 flooding of Mainz-Kastel by the Rhine River. He donated $100,000 (equivalent to $ million today) to San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake - $50,000 personally and $50,000 from his company.\n\nBusch contributed a total of $350,000 (equivalent to $ million today) to Harvard to endow a Germanic museum, named Adolphus Busch Hall.\n\nBusch married Elise \"Lilly\" Eberhard Anheuser, the third daughter of Eberhard Anheuser, on 7 March 1861 in St. Louis, Missouri. They had thirteen children; eight sons, including Adolphus Busch II, August Anheuser Busch I and Carl Busch, and five daughters. The Busches often traveled to Germany where they built their mansion. They named it the Villa Lilly for Mrs Busch. It is located in Lindschied near Langenschwalbach, in present-day Bad Schwalbach.\n\nBusch died in Lindschied in 1913 while on vacation. He had been suffering from dropsy since 1906. He was survived by his widow, five daughters and two sons, August A. and Carl Busch, both of St. Louis. His body was brought back to the United States in 1915 by ship, and transported by train to St. Louis.\n\nAlmost thirty thousand people paid their respects to Adolphus Busch when his body lay in state in the family mansion in St. Louis. Notable guests included the U.S. secretary of agriculture, the president of Harvard University, and the president of the University of California. Twenty-five trucks were needed to transport all the flower arrangements to the cemetery and a 250 piece band led the funeral procession. The procession spanned twenty miles, from No. 1 Busch Place to Bellefontaine Cemetery, Adolphus' final resting place. As many as 100,000 mourners lined the streets for the procession. Five minutes of silence were observed at the request of Mayor Henry W. Kiel and the lights were turned off at the Jefferson and Planter's House hotels. Streetcars were also halted.\n\nLilly Anheuser's parents had built a mausoleum at Bellefontaine Cemetery, but she felt that Adolphus needed something grander. She tore down the original structure, and had the other family members reinterred outside. She had Thomas Barnett design a new mausoleum in the Bavarian Gothic style. Constructed of stone quarried in Missouri, and completed in 1921, the new building cost $250,000 (equivalent to $ million today). It features grapevines representing both Adolphus' birthplace in German wine country, and his favorite beverage. Julius Caesar's words, \"Veni, Vidi, Vici,\" or \"I came, I saw, I conquered\" are inscribed on the lintel.\n\nLilly died of a heart attack and pneumonia on February 17, 1928 in Pasadena, California. Her body was brought back to St. Louis, and was buried beside her husband.\n"}

{"id": "44511538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44511538", "title": "Agricultural machinery industry", "text": "Agricultural machinery industry\n\nThe agricultural machinery industry or agricultural engineering industry is the part of the industry, that produces and maintain tractors, agricultural machinery and agricultural implements. This branch is considered to be part of the machinery industry.\n\nThe agricultural machinery industry emerged in Britain and the United States in the 19th century. Until then the common tools of farming were the plough and the sickle. These iron agricultural implements were often made by blacksmiths in the local village, who regularly also acted as farrier. In the first part of the 19th century some of the early agricultural machine manufacturers arose from these blacksmith workshops, such as John Deere who started up with the production of ploughs in series in the 1840s. \n\nOther companies arose from the introduction of horse drawn reaping, which replaced the type of hand reaper in use since biblical times. A company as the McCormick started up with building these kind of harvesting machines around the 1840s. And another origin of agricultural industry was the introduction of combined harvesting, threshing and cleaning in the 1830s. The Case Corporation for example started building those in 1842 as the Racine Threshing Machine Works. Until early 20th century most of those machinery were powered by horses.\n\nMid 19th century the portable steam-powered plowing engines were introduced. They were used in pairs, placed on either side of a field to haul a plow back and forth between them using a wire cable. These portable engines were also used to power threshing machines, mills and pumps. The portable steam engines were produced by specific agricultural machinery maker, such as Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies who had started as brass and iron-founder making casting ploughshares late 18th century.\n\nLate 19th century in Britain more companies such as Richard Garrett & Sons and Mann’s Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company developed steam tractors for direct ploughing, but the heavy, wet soil of England meant that these designs were less economical than a team of horses. In the United States, where soil conditions permitted, steam tractors were used to direct-haul plows. Steam-powered agricultural engines remained in use well into the 20th century until reliable internal combustion engines had been developed.\n\nCollins (1987) recalled that the impact of the agricultural machinery industry in the 19th century was still limited. He stated : \"prior the third quarter of the nineteenth century the impact of machinery in agriculture was slight compared with that in manufacturing industry. Some operations such as barn work and hay and corn harvesting had been largely mechanized by 1880 but, up to the Second World War, many were still performed by hand labour and large numbers of workers were still required for seasonal tasks such as hop- and fruit-picking and vegetable cultivations.\"\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century in the UK the Agricultural machinery industry \"although composed of many hundreds of firms, was dominated by a few large ones, chiefly in the eastern counties of England. The total output of the industry was estimated to be worth 6.5 million pounds in 1913, or about 5 percent of the total value of the output of the mechanical engineering industry at the first Census of Production in 1907.\"\nIn the first decennia the internal combustion engine; first the petrol engine, and later diesel engines; became the main source of power for the next generation of tractors. Early companies expanded into the tractor business, such as John Deere which bought the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor. In the 1930s new technologies as rubber ties and hydrologics were introduced in tractors and other farm machinery. The diesel engines also contributed to the development of the self-propelled, combined harvester and thresher, or combine harvester (also shortened to 'combine'). Instead of cutting the grain stalks and transporting them to a stationary threshing machine, these combines cut, threshed, and separated the grain while moving continuously through the field.\n\nIn the second part of the 20th century the production of agricultural machinery in development countries rose rapidly. In the 1960s a country as the UK exported more than 60% of its production to Western Europe, Australia, USA, Canada and South Africa, and main manufacturers started production plants abroad. Another trend was the increased concentration among manufacturers. In the 1970s in the UK six companies supplied 75% of the total output.\n\nThe further mechanization of agriculture in the 20th century made possible by the agricultural machinery industry had a huge impact of the economic structure of society. In the developed countries the total labour force engaged in agriculture dropped from about 75% in 1800 to less than 5% late 20th century. In developing countries, in late 20th century still 75% of all land \"was farmed with only hand-tools and draught-animal technology.\" In Turkey still 48% and in India 66.5% of the labor were working in agriculture, according to the FAO Production Yearbook 1990.\n\nA 2013 report by the VDMA gave the following preview of the current developments in the agricultural machinery industry:\n\nThe agricultural machinery industry produces agricultural machinery, machinery used in the operation of agricultural areas and farms. Main types are:\nIn developed countries overall the largest segment of agricultural equipment sales is tractors.\n\nAgricultural machinery manufacturers exist in sizes from small and medium business to multinationals. James & Akrasanee (1988) stipulated that those forms have different production management, and can be classified into three groups:\n\nThe two largest agricultural machinery manufacturers worldwide based on revenue (in 2012): \n\nIn the United States the revenue of tractor & agricultural machinery manufacturing sector increased from about 35 billion U.S. dollars in 2009 to 42 billion U.S. dollars in 2014.\n\nSome of the more important agricultural machinery associations are:\n\n\nAccording to the CEMA, the European association representing the European agricultural machinery industry, Europe was the largest producer of agricultural machinery globally in 2013: \nIn total, the production of agricultural machinery worldwide in 2013 generated about 95 billion euros, based on a report \"Agricultural Machinery November 2013 : Market Perspectives 2014\" by the VDMA, a German engineering association. Another recent statistic mentioned, that the agricultural machinery industry in 2010 generated worldwide about $56 billion.\n\nYuan'en (2007) stated, that the \"Chinese government has attached great importance to agriculture, rural areas and farmers, made a series of policies that favorite to the farmers, added the financial subsidy to the agriculture, especially constituted the subsidy policies for the farmers on their agricultural machinery purchasing.\"\n\nA 2013-2014 report acknowledged that \"China's agricultural machinery industry has achieved rapid development, the gross output value of agricultural machinery exceeded RMB 300 billion, total power of agricultural machinery surpassed 1 billion kilowatts, and the integrated mechanization level of agricultural crops exceeded 50%, demonstrating that China has entered into a mechanized production-oriented period... Tractors and harvesting machinery are the most important agricultural machinery products in China, with annual output of 2.25 million units and 1.114 million units in 2012 separately...\" \n\nGyanendra (2006) recalled, that \"the early agricultural mechanization in India was greatly influenced by the technological development in England. Irrigation pumps, tillage equipment, chaff cutters, tractors and threshers were gradually introduced for farm mechanization. The high yielding varieties with assured irrigation and higher rate of application of fertilizers gave higher returns that enabled farmers to adopt mechanization inputs, especially after Green revolution in 1960s.\"\n\nThe Turkish Ministry of Economy (2011) explained that \"Turkey is one of the few countries of the world which is self-sufficient in food. At present Turkey is the largest producer and exporter of agricultural products in the Near East and North Africa... The agricultural machinery industry is about 1000 manufacturers countrywide... Companies manufacturing agricultural machinery and equipment except tractors are mostly small and medium size companies. The sector employs about 15,000 workers... The value of agricultural machinery and spare parts and agricultural tractors and trailers exports was US$ 313 million in 2009.\"\nWith a volume of 28 billion euros (2014) agricultural machinery production in the European Union (EU) represented 28 per cent of world total according to VDMA. Out of the EU total, the share of Germany is 27 per cent, followed by Italy (17 per cent) and France (14 per cent). All leading international manufacturers have several production sites on the European continent, and their products from these factories in general are destined for the high end customers who yield for efficiency and accuracy on the fields. \n\nThe EU production of tractors was 187,000 units, correspondent to a value of 9.4 billion euros (2014). Outside the EU, a major production site for tractors is the Minsk Tractor Works (Belarus) with a high market share in the neighbouring countries, especially within the Commonwealth of Independent States. The leading countries for tractor production in the EU are Germany and Italy (with John Deere, Case New Holland, AGCO and Same Deutz-Fahr being the major brands). Germany is also the major place for the manufacturing of harvesting, spraying, fertilizing and seeding equipment. Italy and France have a primary position for soil working machines and transportation vehicles. The majority of the agricultural machinery companies are small and medium-sized and family owned. \n\nOne third of the EU production is destined to markets outside the union, mainly to the Eastern European markets, but also to North America and, increasingly, to Asia. \n\nAfter a peak in 2003 and 29 billion euros of turnover, the sector experienced an economic downturn in 2014/2015. The strategy of the European industry is to keep its leading technological position and to diversify its market presence into the high potential regions (e.g. Asia). \n\nThe AEM (2014) stated that \"U.S. domestic sales of agricultural machinery and equipment rose from about $20 billion in 1999 to $38 billion in 2012. Since 1998 and through 2012, U.S. exports of agricultural equipment have grown relatively quickly, more than doubling from about $4 billion to $8.7 billion.\n\nGraciela summarized (2008) that \"the agricultural machinery industry in Argentina depends for growth on higher exports and further progress towards internationalization, which are strategic goals for the largest firms. Given the dynamism of global demand for this type of machinery, the conclusion is that the sector can increase its sales in export markets, where some of its products are competing well.\"\n\n"}

As the dominant partner of Drexel & Co. of Philadelphia, he founded Drexel, Morgan & Co (later J.P. Morgan & Co.) in New York in 1871 with J. P. Morgan as his junior partner. He also founded Drexel University in 1891. He was also the first president of the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art), the nation's first private organization dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning.\n\nDrexel was born in 1826 in Philadelphia to Francis Martin Drexel (1792–1863) and Catherine Hookey (1795–1870). He was the brother of Francis Anthony Drexel, and Joseph William Drexel. He was the uncle of Saint Katharine Drexel.\n\nAt the age of 13 he began to work in the banking house founded three years earlier by his father, the Austrian-born American banker Francis Martin Drexel. In 1847 he was named a member of the firm Drexel & Company, the original predecessor of what would become Drexel Burnham Lambert.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1863, Drexel closed the bank's Chicago and San Francisco offices and changed the name of its New York branch from Read, Drexel & Co. to Drexel Winthrop. In 1867 he founded a separate Paris-based banking partnership, Drexel, Harjes & Co., with John H. Harjes and Eugene Winthrop.\n\nThree years later, in 1871, at the urging of Junius Spencer Morgan in London, Drexel became the mentor of Junius's troubled son, John Pierpont Morgan of New York, and entered into a new partnership with young Morgan, forming Drexel, Morgan & Co. This new merchant banking partnership, which was based in New York, rather than Philadelphia, served initially as an agent for Europeans investing in the United States. Over the next generation, this partnership assumed the leading role in financing America's railroads and stabilizing and revitalizing Wall Street's chaotic securities markets. The firm created a national capital market for industrial companies— a market that had previously existed only for railroads and canals. To restore investor confidence, Drexel Morgan underwrote the pay of the entire U.S. Army when Congress refused to do so in 1877, bailed out the U.S.Government during the Panic of 1895 and rescued the New York Stock Exchange during the Panic of 1907. With the formation of Drexel, Morgan & Co., Drexel Harjes became the French affiliate of an international banking firm with offices in London, Philadelphia, New York City and Paris that would subsequently become J.P. Morgan & Co.\n\nTwo years after Drexel's death in 1893, Drexel, Morgan & Co. was renamed J.P. Morgan & Co.., one of the original predecessors of what is today JPMorgan Chase. In 1901, the bank financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, the world's first billion-dollar corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and other companies.\n\nDrexel married Ellen B. Rozet (1832–1891), the daughter of John Roset (1794–1870) and Mary Ann Laning (1807–1880). Together, they had the following children:\nHe was also the grandfather of Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Sr. (1874–1948) and the great-grandfather of Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr. (1897–1961), the United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Norway.\n\nDrexel died of a heart attack on June 30, 1893 in Karlsbad (in the German-speaking part of Bohemia, Austrian Empire), today Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic, at the age of 66, and was buried in Woodlands Cemetery in Philadelphia.\n\n\n"}

The Becher process removes the iron oxide, leaving a residue of synthetic rutile, which is more than 90% TiO.\n\nThis technology was developed in the early 1960s in Western Australia by a joint initiative between industry and government. The process was named after Robert Gordon Becher, who while working at the Western Australian Government Chemical Laboratories invented, developed and introduced the technique to the Western Australian Mineral Sands industry. The process was patented in 1961.\n\nThe Becher Process is suitable for weathered ilmenite that has low concentrations of chromium and magnesium. There are four steps involved in removing the iron portion of the ilmentite:\n\nOxidation involves heating the ilmenite in a rotary kiln with air to convert all of the iron in the ilmenite grains to iron(III) oxide:\n\nThis allows for use of a wide range of ilmenite materials with varying Fe(II) and Fe(III) content to be used in the next step.\n\nReduction is performed in a rotary kiln with pseudobrookite (FeO.TiO), coal and sulfur, then heated to a temperature greater than 1200 °C. The iron oxide in the mineral grains is reduced to metallic iron to produce reduced ilmenite:\n\nOnce the Reduced Ilmenite has cooled it is separated from the char by screening, then continues to the next step of the process.\n\nAeration involves the removal of the metallic iron created in the last step by \"rusting\" it out. This is achieved in large tanks that contain 1% ammonium chloride solution with air being pumped through the tank. The tank is being continuously agitated, and the iron will rust and precipitate out of solution, away from the titanium dioxide portion in the form of a slime.\n\nThe finer iron oxide is then separated from the larger particles of synthetic rutile.\n\nOnce the majority of the Iron Oxide has been removed the remainder of it is leached away using 0.5M sulfuric acid.\n\n"}

As of March 2017, he is the richest person in Iceland and 1,161st richest person in the world according to Forbes. His most valuable holding today through Novator Partners is a share in Polish telecom outfit Play and he has also invested in smaller startups such as the Zwift online platform for indoor cycling as well as the Icelandic MMOG company CCP Games.\n\nBjörgólfur was the first Icelander to join \"Forbes\" magazine<nowiki>'s list of the world's richest people in 2005;</nowiki> has been declared \"Iceland's first billionaire\"; and was ranked as the 249th-richest person in the world by \"Forbes\" magazine in 2007—up from 350th the previous year—with a net worth of $3.5 billion. In 2007 the \"Sunday Times\"’ Sunday Times Rich List put his net worth at £2,000 million. However, following the financial crisis of 2007–2010, Björgólfur's net worth had declined to $1 billion by March 2009. He worked out a complex deal with his creditors to pay off his debts while holding on to his key investments and on March 20, 2017 Forbes estimated his net worth at $1.81 billion. He published an autobiography in 2014.\n\nBjörgólfur Thor is heir to a long family legacy in Icelandic business and politics. His great-grandfather was the legendary Danish-born Icelandic entrepreneur Thor Jensen, who helped introduce industrial capitalism to the country in the early years of the twentieth century. The eighth of Thor's eleven children was Margrét Þorbjörg Thors Hallgrímsson, whose daughter Þóra Hallgrímsson had Björgólfur Thor as her only child by her third husband Björgólfur Guðmundsson. Þóra Hallgrímsdóttir, Björgólfur Thor's mother, was married to George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi party. Björgólfur Thor has often emphasised this, for example by adapting for his company Novator the old logo of Eimskip, which Thor had originally designed for his company Kveldúlfur hf, and through his association with the biographical documentary \"Thor's Saga\" by Ulla Boje Rasmussen, which draws parallels between Thor Jensen and Björgólfur Thor.\n\nBjörgólfur Thor grew up in the Reykjavík suburb of Vesturbær. A sketch of Björgólfur Thor's early life is offered by Ármann Þorvaldsson:\n\nIn 1986, the firm of Björgólfur Thor's father Björgólfur Guðmundsson, Hafskip, became embroiled in a financial scandal and was bankrupted; the scandal may have arisen from the efforts of Hafskip's main competitor Eimskip and its allied political party, the Independence Party, to reduce competition, and the events had a considerable effect on the young Björgólfur Thor. At times he has presented his subsequent business activities as an effort to regain his and his father's reputations and pay their opponents back. Graduating from the prestigious Commercial College of Iceland in 1987, he followed in the footsteps of some of his siblings and moved to the US, in a move he has portrayed as an attempt to escape an Iceland where he felt an outsider. He began higher education at the University of California, San Diego, later transferring to the Leonard N Stern School of Business at New York University, graduating with a B.S. in Marketing in 1991.\n\nWhile studying, Björgólfur Thor took a variety of vacation jobs, including running events manager at Reykjavík's then two biggest clubs: Tunglið and Skuggabarinn. In the course of this, in 1991, he met Kristín Ólafsdóttir, now a film-maker; they married in 2010. They have three children, Daniel (b. 2005), Lorenz (b. 2009), and Bentina (b. 2011). They currently live primarily in London, United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1991, Björgólfur Thor went to Russia along with his father and a friend, Magnús Þorsteinsson. The Icelandic businessmen, together with Russian partners, founded the bottling company \"Baltic Bottling Plant\", which they sold to Pepsi. Next they founded a brewing company, originally called \"ООО \"Торговый дом \"РОСА\"\" it was registered in March 1995 and changed its name to \"Bravo\" OOO in February 1996. It further changed its name to \"Bravo International\" OOO in August 1996 and \"Bravo International\" JSC in December 1997. The founders of Bravo were six companies registered in Limassol, Cyprus. Björgólfur Thor was president of all of them. \"Bravo Brewery\" became a success producing the premium beer Botchkarov. The company became the fastest-growing brewery in Russia. Heineken bought the brewery for $400M in 2002.\n\nIn 2000, Saint Petersburg opened an honorary consulate in Iceland. Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson was appointed Consul and Magnús Þorsteinsson was appointed Honorary Vice-Consul. The opening ceremony was held on March 10, 2000.\n\nBjörgólfur Thor's ventures in Russia raised suspicion. An article in \"The Guardian\" wondered where Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson's money came from and noted that in the 1990s the men \"were not only ploughing money into the country but doing it in the city regarded as the Russian mafia capital. That investment was being made in the drinks sector, seen by the mafia as the industry of choice.\" Similar concerns were raised by \"Die Welt\". Competitors in the Saint Petersburg brewing market faced problems. For instance, Ilya Weismann, deputy director of competing beverage company \"Baltic\", was assassinated on 10 January 2000. Later \"Baltic\" director general Aslanbek Chochiev was also assassinated. One competing Saint Petersburg brewery burned to the ground.\n\nBjörgólfur Thor has strongly denied any connection with mafia activity. In his book, \"Billions to Bust and Back\", he chronicles his time in St Petersburg, detailing how criminal elements tried to intimidate him into giving them access to his business and explaining which security measures he relied on to prevent it.\n\nAfter leaving Russia, Björgólfur Thor started investing in several Icelandic firms in 2002. By 2006 he was a celebrity for his business success, being devoted an eight-page profile comprising a whole Sunday supplement of the Icelandic newspaper \"Morgunblaðið\" in that year.\n\nNovator Partners, which was founded and is managed by Björgólfur Thor, is a private equity firm with headquarters in London and offices in Luxembourg. The company has bought assets around Eastern Europe . The company's owners are unknown.\n\nLate in 2002, Björgólfur Thor and Björgólfur Guðmundsson's holding company Samson ehf. gained a 45% controlling share of Landsbanki, Iceland's second largest bank, for about ISK12m in a controversial privatization. The board was announced in February 2003, with the chairman being Björgólfur Thor's father. Landsbanki was declared to be acting contrary to the interests of the United Kingdom and placed on a watchlist usually used for the blocking of funds to terrorist organizations by the British government after bankruptcy in October 2008.\n\nBjörgólfur Thor was the main owner as well as the chairman of the Straumur Investment Bank.\n\nTwo of Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson's companies, Landsbanki and Straumur, left the Icelandic people with several billions of dollars in debt when they went bankrupt following the 2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis. He has been heavily criticized for his actions leading to the crisis.\n\nTwo days after the publication of the Icelandic government report on the financial crisis on 12 April 2010, Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson issued a public apology for his role in the crisis in the Icelandic newspaper \"Fréttablaðið\", including the statement:\n\nAlthough Björgólfur Thor's fortunes were reduced by the financial crisis, leading him to cancel the construction of a £100m luxury yacht, he has continued to prosper overall. He has defended his reputation by disputing government and journalistic criticisms of his role in the 2008 financial crisis on his website, through letters to newspapers, and through legal action.\n\nIn December 2013, the website \"The Automatic Earth\" reported:Mr Bjorgolfsson still leads Novator Partners, a London-based investment firm, sits on several boards and holds shares in companies including Actavis, a Swiss drugmaker, and CCP, an Icelandic computer games company. His representative says any dividends from his shares, or future gains from their sale, will go towards settling debts to creditors following Landsbanki's decline. In 2015 Björgólfur Thor and his father were both mentioned in the Panama Papers as having connections to at least 50 offshore companies in tax havens established through Mossack Fonseca. According to Iceland Review Björgólfur sr. and jr. were the largest Icelandic investors mentioned in the Panama Papers. \n\nIn November 2017, Björgólfur Thor was named in the Paradise Papers together with Gísli Hjálmtýsson, Róbert Guðfinnsson, and a number of Iceland's National Power Company employees. The listed companies connected to Björgólfsson were registered in Bermuda.\n\nBjörgólfur Thor was one of the lead investors in Atai Life Sciences AG's 2018 funding rounds. Atai life is a healthcare investment firm that backs studies of magic mushrooms to treat depression. According to Bloomberg's report the round Björgólfur Thor participated in raised $25 million.\n\nBjörgólfur Thor Björgólfsson is the inspiration for the main character of Bjarni Harðarson's satirical novel about the 2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis, \"Sigurðar saga fóts: Íslensk riddarasaga\", where his counterpart is the main character, Sigurður frits ('fótur') Bjarnhéðinsson. He is also the inspiration for the main character of Bjarni Bjarnason's novel \"\" ('reputation'), Starkaður Leví, who pays for the identity (and the life) of a well respected writer.\n\nBjörgólfur Thor and his great-grandfather Thor Jensen are the subject of the 2011 documentary film \"Thors saga\" by Ulla Boje Rasmussen.\n\n"}

It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.” \n\nComprehensive income is the sum of net income and other items that must bypass the income statement because they have not been realized, including items like an unrealized holding gain or loss from available for sale securities and foreign currency translation gains or losses. These items are not part of net income, yet are important enough to be included in comprehensive income, giving the user a bigger, more comprehensive picture of the organization as a whole.\n\nItems included in comprehensive income, but not net income are reported under the accumulated other comprehensive income section of shareholder's equity.\n\nComprehensive income attempts to measure the sum total of all operating and financial events that have changed the value of an owner's interest in a business.

{"id": "21079093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21079093", "title": "Cram down", "text": "Cram down\n\nA cram down or cramdown is the involuntary imposition by a court of a reorganization plan over the objection of some classes of creditors.\n\nWhile typically used in a corporate context, the phrase has gained popularity in the context of personal bankruptcies as a result of the financial crisis of 2007-2009. \n\nUnder current United States law, bankruptcy courts are not allowed to perform cramdowns (i.e., reduce the principal amount or change the interest rate or other terms) on creditors who hold loans secured by mortgages on debtors' primary residences. \n\nU.S. bankruptcy law provides for an automatic stay of any legal process against debtors or their assets (except perhaps legal process involving criminal law or family law) while bankruptcy is pending, but because U.S. bankruptcy courts cannot cram down loans secured by primary residences, creditors are able to file motions for relief from the stay. Once relief is granted, creditors may proceed with foreclosure \"immediately\" while debtors' other financial obligations await restructuring by the bankruptcy court. Debtors may eventually obtain discharges of their other debts, but by then, they may already have lost their homes.\n\nThe prohibition on cramdowns on loans secured by primary residences was the result of a political compromise during the process of enacting the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. At the time, Congress was confronted with brutal stagflation in which economic stagnation was combined with sky-high inflation and interest rates, which were severely frustrating the United States' long-term federal public policy of promoting homeownership (which goes back to the National Housing Act of 1934). Congress therefore decided to shield lenders on loans secured by primary residences from cramdowns because there was evidence that they perform \"a valuable social service\" through their loans. \n\nGenerally, under risk-based pricing, a rational lender will underwrite a loan with an interest rate that correlates directly to the borrower's credit risk. That is the risk that the lender cannot recover its entire expected return on investment, which in turn includes not only the probability of default, but also any external forces (like a bankruptcy court) that could delay repayment or force the lender to write off any part of the loan. The higher the risk, the higher the interest rate. Thus, Congress reasoned, if lenders knew their loans were protected from cramdowns, then they would offer loans at lower interest rates, which in turn would mean lower monthly payments, and thereby enable more Americans to afford homes. In plain English, Congress sacrificed the interests of the minority of borrower-homeowners who default on their loans for the sake of lowering the cost of homeownership for the majority of borrower-homeowners who successfully repay their loans. \n\nThis rule was fiercely litigated in the 1980s, but the prohibitions on cramdowns on primary residences in both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings were eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the early 1990s. Finding no relief in Chapters 7 or 13, some individual borrowers tried the creative move of filing under Chapter 11 (which is normally used by corporations). As a result, the home lending industry went back to Congress, which responded by extending the cramdown restriction for loans secured by primary residences to Chapter 11 with the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.\n\nAs a potential solution to the subprime mortgage crisis, legislators and consumer advocates have advanced a proposal to allow cram downs on these loans, and legislation to that effect was introduced for potential inclusion in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. \n\nHowever, the financial industry strongly voiced opposition to such a measure, claiming that it would create additional uncertainty as to the value of mortgage loans (and by extension, the collateralized debt obligations into which they are bundled). In addition, like in the late 1970s, the financial industry had powerful political leverage on its side: the risk that revoking the cramdown restriction would result in higher interest rates on home loans. It was impossible to simultaneously enact a law preventing the industry from jacking up interest rates on all home loans; that would have raised the possibility of bank runs, because few investors would keep their money at an institution that is legally prohibited from setting interest rates on its loans to accurately reflect the underlying credit risk. To prevent bank runs, Congress could have simultaneously imposed capital transfer restrictions, but that would have paralyzed the global economy. As few politicians wanted to be blamed by Wall Street for making homes unaffordable or causing even more bank failures or a second Great Depression, the proposals for revoking the prevention of cramdowns on loans secured by primary residences never found much traction in Congress.\n\nThe term \"cram down\" in the reorganization context appears in case law as early as 1944.\n\nThe term (sometimes used in the phrase cram-down deal) has also gained currency to denote informally any transaction where existing investors (debt or equity) are forced by circumstance to accept an unappealing transaction, such as an expensive financing, a debt transaction that subordinates them, a dilutive equity raising, or an acquisition at an unappealingly low price.\n\n"}

This cost is incurred by the organization to convince a potential customer. This is an important business metric. It plays a major role in calculating the value of the customer to the company and the resulting return on investment (ROI) of acquisition. The calculation of customer valuation helps a company decide how much of its resources can be profitably spent on a particular customer. In general terms, it helps to decide the worth of the customer to the company.\n\nCustomer Acquisition Cost (abbreviated to CAC) refers to the resources that a business must allocate (financial or otherwise) in order to acquire an additional customer.\n\nNumerically, \"customer acquisition cost\" is typically expressed as a ratio — dividing the sum total of \"CAC\" by the number of additional patrons acquired by the business as a result of the customer acquisition strategy.\n\n\"Customer Acquisition Cost\" will typically increase as a business matures. It is also typical to see a diminishing return on \"CAC\" as a business grows in size and possibly geographical distribution. At some point, a given customer acquisition strategy will no longer be beneficial - this means that the financial rate of return that can be expected to accompany new customers is surpassed by the cost of acquiring those customers in the first place. Most businesses wisely choose to adopt a different strategy for customer acquisition before this point is reached.\n\nCustomer acquisition cost can be used in conjunction with SaaS, B2B software sales and startups. The metric is mentioned in the publications of venture capital firms such as Accel Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners or Matrix Partners. The CAC ratio also appears in business oriented magazines such as Forbes and Inc.com.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35291063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35291063", "title": "Drama theory", "text": "Drama theory\n\nDrama theory is one of the problem structuring methods in operations research. It is based on game theory and adapts the use of games to complex organisational situations, accounting for emotional responses that can provoke irrational reactions and lead the players to redefine the game. In a drama, emotions trigger rationalizations that create changes in the game, and so change follows change until either all conflicts are resolved or action becomes necessary. The game as redefined is then played.\n\nDrama theory was devised by Professor Nigel Howard in the early 90s and, since then, has been turned to defense, political, health, industrial relations and commercial applications. Drama theory is an extension of Howard's metagame analysis work developed at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1960s, and presented formally in his book \"Paradoxes of Rationality\", published by MIT Press. Metagame analysis was originally used to advise on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT).\n\nA drama unfolds through \"episodes\" in which \"characters\" interact. The episode is a period of \"preplay communication\" between characters who, after communicating, act as players in a game that's constructed through the dialogue between them. The action that follows the episode is the playing out of this game; it sets up the next episode. Most drama-theoretic terminology is derived from a theatrical model applied to real life interactions; thus, an episode goes through phases of \"scene-setting\", \"build-up\", \"climax\" and \"decision\". This is followed by \"denouement\", which is the action that sets up the next episode. The term 'drama theory' and the use of theatrical terminology is justified by the fact that the theory applies to stage plays and fictional plots as well as to politics, war, business, personal and community relations, psychology, history and other kinds of human interaction. It was applied to help with the structuring of Prisoner's Dilemma, a West End play by David Edgar about the problems of peace-keeping.\nIn the build-up phase of an episode, the characters exchange ideas and opinions in some form or another and try to advocate their preferred \"position\" – the game outcome that they are hoping to see realised. The position each character takes may be influenced by others' positions. Each character also presents a \"fallback\" or \"stated intention\". This is the action (i.e., individual strategy) a character says it will implement if current positions and stated intentions do not change. Taken together, the stated intentions form what is called a \"threatened future\" if they contradict some character's position; if they do not – i.e., if they implement every position – they form what is called an \"agreement\".\n\nWhen it is common knowledge among the characters that positions and stated intentions are seen by their presenters as 'final', the build-up ends and the parties reach a \"moment of truth\". Here they usually face \"dilemmas\" arising from the fact that their threats or promises are incredible or inadequate. Different dilemmas are possible depending on whether or not there is an agreement. If there is an agreement (i.e., stated intentions implement every position), the possible dilemmas resemble those found in the prisoner's dilemma game; they arise from characters distrusting each other's declared intention to implement the agreement. If there is no agreement, more dilemmas are possible, resembling those in the game of chicken; they arise from the fact that a character's threat or its determination to stick to its position and reject other positions may be incredible to another character.\n\nDrama theory asserts that a character faced with a dilemma feels specific positive or negative emotions that it tries to rationalize by persuading itself and others that the game should be redefined in a way that eliminates the dilemma; for example, a character with an incredible threat makes it credible by becoming angry and finding reasons why it should prefer to carry out the threat; likewise, a character with an incredible promise feels positive emotion toward the other as it looks for reasons why it should prefer to carry its promise. Emotional tension leads to the \"climax\", where characters re-define the moment of truth by finding rationalizations for changing positions, stated intentions, preferences, options or the set of characters. There is some experimental evidence to confirm this assertion of drama theory (see P. Murray-Jones, L. Stubbs and N. Howard, 'Confrontation and Collaboration Analysis: Experimental and Mathematical Results', presented at the 8th International Command & Control Research and Technology Symposium, June, 2003—from whose site it can be downloaded.\n\nSix dilemmas (formerly called paradoxes) are defined, and it is proved that if none of them exist then the characters have an agreement that they fully trust each other to carry out. This is the fundamental theorem of drama theory. Until a \"resolution\" meeting these conditions is arrived at, the characters are under emotional pressure to rationalize re-definitions of the game that they will play. Re-definitions inspired by new dilemmas then follow each other until eventually, with or without a resolution, characters become players in the game they have defined for themselves. In game-theoretic terms, this is a 'game with a focal point' – i.e., it is a game in which each player has stated its intention to implement a certain strategy. This strategy is its threat (part of the threatened future) if an agreement has not been reached, and its promise (part of the agreement), if an agreement has been reached. At this point, players (since they are playing a game) decide whether to believe each other, and so to predict what others will do in order to decide what to do themselves.\n\nThe dilemmas that character A may face with respect to another character B at a moment of truth are as follows.\n\n\nDrama-theorists build and analyze models (called \"card tables\" or \"options boards\") that are isomorphic to game models, but unlike game theorists and most other model-builders, do not do so with the aim of finding a 'solution'. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will re-define the model itself – i.e., the game that will be played. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.\n\nThe relation between drama theory and game theory is complementary in nature. Game theory does not explain how the game that is played is arrived at – i.e., how players select a small number of players and strategies from the virtually infinite set they could select, and how they arrive at common knowledge about each other's selections and preferences for the resulting combinations of strategies. Drama theory tries to explain this, and also to explain how the 'focal point' is arrived at for the 'game with a focal point' that is finally played. On the other hand, drama theory does not explain how players will act when they finally have to play a particular 'game with a focal point', even though it has to make assumptions about this. This is what game theory tries to explain and predict.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Frances was the daughter of Orlando Jones and Martha Macon, prosperous Virginia landowners, and she is more commonly known as the mother of the first First Lady of the United States, Martha Washington.\n\nFrances' father, Orlando Jones, was a Burgess for New Kent County in 1718 in the House of Burgesses, the leading legislative body in Colonial Virginia. Her grandfather, Col. Gideon Macon (father of Martha Macon), was also a member of the House of Burgesses from 1696 to 1702, and was secretary to Sir William Berkeley, governor of Virginia, during his second term in office.\n\nUpon Col. Macon's death in 1702, his widow, Martha Woodward Macon, married Captain Nathaniel West who was also a representative in the House of Burgesses.\n\nCaptain Nathaniel West and Martha Woodward Macon West had two children. Their daughter, Unity West, married John Dandridge's brother, William Dandridge. William Dandridge was appointed to the Governor's Council in 1727, the highest political position available to colony residents. All of this would suggest that Frances, her husband, and children would have been quite familiar with colonial politics.\n\nFrances, or Fanny, was born on a plantation near Williamsburg on Queen's Creek within easy distance of the growing capital. Frances had an older brother, Lane Jones, born in 1707, and Frances was born in 1710. Her mother, Martha Macon Jones, died when Frances was only six years old.\n\nOrlando Jones soon remarried. His second wife, Mary Elizabeth William Jones, became the sole parent of the two children just three years later when Orlando Jones died. Orlando and Mary had no children together.\n\nA year later, Orlando's widow married John James Flourney and her stepchildren lived with them in Williamsburg. Mary Elizabeth William Jones Flourney was their guardian, and as such, could use the income from the Queen's Creek plantation to support the two stepchildren. The sister of the late Orlando Jones sued twice for custody of her niece and nephew, but was denied. When Lane Jones reached the age of eighteen, he legally emancipated himself and moved in with his aunt in Timson's Neck.\n\nTen months later, when Frances was sixteen, she also sued for emancipation. She did not move in with her aunt, but instead lived with a planter in New Kent. Her mother's parents had been from that region and a number of Macon relatives lived there.\n\nShortly after Frances Jones married John Dandridge in New Kent County, Virginia on July 22, 1730, they moved to their new home, Chestnut Grove. John Dandridge became Clerk of Courts in New Kent and kept that position for the next 26 years. He was also vestryman and churchwarden for St. Peter's Church, Church of England. John was a prominent planter, and a Colonel in his military district.\n\nThe Dandridges' home, Chestnut Grove, was on the bank of the Pamunkey River in New Kent County, Virginia. John's older brother, William Dandridge (1689–1743), lived on the opposite bank of the river with his wife Unity West Dandridge at their estate, Elsing Green, in King William County, Virginia. Chestnut Grove Plantation burned down in 1926, but its former site was only four miles from the location of New Kent's current County Courthouse.\n\nJohn and Frances Jones Dandridge also owned a house in Williamsburg and visited there frequently.\n\nJohn and Frances Jones Dandridge produced eight children, Martha Dandridge being the eldest. As was typical of the time, the children were educated at home, their education being considered quite liberal. John and Frances employed a tutor for their children. It was also quite unusual that Martha was presented to society in Williamsburg at the young age of 15.\n\nTheir daughter, Martha, first married Daniel Parke Custis. Following his death she later married George Washington and became First Lady of the United States of America.\n\nOne of their sons, Bartholomew Dandridge, followed in his father's footsteps and became Clerk of Courts in New Kent County. And he, like his father, also served as both vestryman and churchwarden, but at the Blisland Parish rather than the St. Peter's Parish.\n\n\nIllegitimate children of John Dandridge: \n\nHer husband, Colonel John Dandridge, died in Fredericksburg on 31 August 1756. He was interred at St. George's Episcopal Church in Fredricksburg.\n\nThere are a number of conflicting reports on the date of death for Frances Jones, but the one most commonly reported is July 9, 1785.\n\n"}

After resigning as chairman, he founded the Kinokuni Doyukai (Association) and developed activities that encouraged democracy.\n\nNote: In July 1871, the abolition of the han system (feudal clan system) and establishment of the prefecture system was an act to replace the traditional han system and introduce new local government.\n\n\"The northwestern part of Hiro-Mura (current Hirogawa-cho) is facing the ocean and Miya-zaki (part of current Arida City) is located about 12 kilometers away right across of the bay. Kiri-saki and Ta-saki are parts of Tamura and Suhara (districts in current Yuasa-cho) along the jugged coastline between Hiro-Mura and Miya-zaki. Shira-saki (part of current Yura-cho) is located about 12 kilometer away from Hiro-Mura in the other direction. Nabae-saki and Medo-saki can be found near the area. The distance between Miya-zaki and Shira-saki is about 16 kilometer and there are Ashika-shima, Tsuru-shima and Kuro-shima in the Hidaka county side of the triangle area in the bay. Taka-shima, Karumo and Kenashi Islands are scattered in the east of those three islands like stars in night sky.\"\n\nAs Goryo Hamaguchi described, he appreciated the beauty of his hometown in those islands and colors of waves that he could see from the village by the bay. Even though it would change the natural beauty of the village, he decided to spend a significant amount of money to build a seawall along the coastline of the village (more than 650 meters). He planted rows of adult pine trees behind the seawall to prevent damage to the village from such a natural disaster as a tsunami.\n\nThe seawall and pines trees are the symbol of the acts by this great man and the eternal message to the villagers of what life is all about. Hamaguchi set an example of overcoming any hardship with dignity and wisdom. This is how he lived in the period of Meiji Restoration when Japan was searching for a leader can bring a country to right direction.\n\nThe Hamaguchis were known as a ruling family of Hiro-Mura in Arida country over the years. They are the descendants of Yasutada of Taira who served the Lord Shiba in Owari (now called Aichi Prefecture) and later renounced his regular daily life to practice at the Hodoin Temple in Mt. Koya. During the Meio period (1492–1500), he moved to Hiro-Mura and became a believer of the ninth priest of Jitsunyo (Shonin) in the Honganji Temple sect. During the Eisho period (1504–1520), he became a Buddhist monk called Seiryo and opened his own center of practice in Hiro-Mura.\n\nHis youngest son, Masaayoshi, took over his position to represent current Anraku-ji Temple in Hirogawa-cho. Yajiro Sanekage, another son of Yasutada, started a new family and it marked the beginning of the Hagaguchi family. The family engaged in soy sauce manufacturing business at the port of Choshi in Kamifusa (currently the northern part of Chiba Prefecture) during the Genroku period (1688–1703) under Tomonao's watch. It was the foundation of Yamasa Corporation. The family tradition of using Gihei for the head of Hamagichi family started after Tomonao's tenure.\n\nThanks to the geographical advantage of Chiba and other attributes related to soy sauce manufacturing, as well as dedicated efforts by the members of Hamagichi family over the generations after the first Gehei, Yamasa's business flourished during the periods of Kyoho (1716–1735) and Houreki (1751–1763). Yamasa products were gaining popularity and in a huge demand by people in Edo (now called Tokyo) because of its premier quality. \n\nDuring the Bunsei period (1818–1829), the feudal government of Japan enforced its price control for almost all products. However, Yamasa products were exempted from governmental pricing control since its product quality was superior to others; the government even gave its highest honor to Yamasa as a soy sauce manufacture.\n\nShichiemon, a younger brother of the fourth Gihei and the first to carry that name, started a branch family under the Hamagichi's name. Since the second Shichiemon had no child, the younger brother of the fifth Gihei became the next Shichiemon. The sixth Gihei had no child either and the first son of the third Shichiemon became a successor of the original Hamaguchi family. He was Goryo Hamaguchi. Although he was adopted to the original Hamaguchi from its branch family, the fifth Gihei was his grandfather and his stepfather was a real uncle of his. Therefore, the bloodline is intact.\n\nThe fifth Gihei, grandfather of Goryo with a great personality, was truly polite and showed his interest in variety of things. He found time to study and enjoyed fine arts when he could get away from his work. He mastered the painting style of southern Chinese school under Kaiseki Noro and used \"Kampo\" as his signature. Goryo admired and respected him and was well taken care of by him. In that regard, Goryo was very much influenced by his grandfather in developing his own personality.\n\nGoryo Hamaguchi was born on June 15, 1820 in Hiro-mura. He was raised by his biological mother Shin after his father, the third Shichiemon, died at the age of 22 when he was 2 years old. In September 1831, he was adopted to the original Hamaguchi family as a successor and renamed his name to \"Gita\". He soon left Hiro-mura for Choshi where he started learning the family business. The Hamaguchi family (Kichiemon) had a house in Koami-cho, a Nihon-bashi district of Edo, where he stayed for a while before coming to Choshi because it was an important place for its business geographically (on the way to Choshi from Kishu). According to the Hamaguchi creed, family members were treated equally with other employees and were not allowed to fool around. One of the reasons was to learn how to handle lots of problems and to learn how to deal with people. He was not an exception and slept in the same room and ate the same dishes as other employees.\n\nOvercoming many hardships in his early ages, he dedicated himself to the family business. At the age of 15, he celebrated his \"Genko\", a ceremony to be recognized as an adult, and renamed himself \"Gitaro\". He put lots of efforts in practicing swordsmanship and studying the I Ching, as his grandfather Kampo encouraged him. Kampo died in the autumn when he turned 18.\n\nIn October 1839, Goryo married a daughter of Umetaro Ikenaga in Yuasa at the age of 20. After staying in Hiro-mura for another six months, he came back to Choshi via Edo in the following spring. By the time, he already mastered techniques of martial arts, especially swordsmanship. In addition, he was very good at composing and writing poems.\n\nHe met Gonsai Miyake, who became his mentor and friend for life, in his academic quest and physical training. Gonsai was originally from Shimabara in Hizen (current Nagasaki Prefecture) and devoted himself in medical study since his birth in 1817 (Bunka 14). He studied science introduced to Japan by Dutch in Nagasaki and later moved to Edo. At that time, people were debating Chinese medicine and Western medicine, until the feudal government ruled in favor of Chinese medicine because of its similar environment to Japanese. Western medicine was prohibited until the following March.\n\nOn April 21, 1885, Hamaguchi died in New York during his tour of Europe and the United States, which had been a long-cherished desire of his.\n\nHis funeral was held on June 15, 1885, in Hiro-Mura and more than 4,000 people gathered to pay their final respects.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14567", "title": "International trade", "text": "International trade\n\nTrading globally gives consumers and countries the opportunity to be exposed to new markets and products. Almost every kind of product can be found in the international market: food, clothes, spare parts, oil, jewelry, wine, stocks, currencies, and water. Services are also traded: tourism, banking, consulting, and transportation. A product that is transferred or sold from a party in one country to a party in another country is an export from the originating country, and an import to the country receiving that product. Imports and exports are accounted for in a country's current account in the balance of payments.\n\nIndustrialization, advanced technology, including transportation, globalization, multinational corporations, and outsourcing are all having a major impact on the international trade system. Increasing international trade is crucial to the continuance of globalization. Nations would be limited to the goods and services produced within their own borders without international trade. International trade is, in principle, not different from domestic trade as the motivation and the behavior of parties involved in a trade do not change fundamentally regardless of whether trade is across a border or not. The main difference is that international trade is typically more costly than domestic trade. This is due to the fact that a border typically imposes additional costs such as tariffs, time costs due to border delays, and costs associated with country differences such as language, the legal system, or culture.\n\nAnother difference between domestic and international trade is that factors of production such as capital and labor are typically more mobile within a country than across countries. Thus, international trade is mostly restricted to trade in goods and services, and only to a lesser extent to trade in capital, labour, or other factors of production. Trade in goods and services can serve as a substitute for trade in factors of production. Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of that factor of production and thus embody it. An example of this is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China. Instead of importing Chinese labor, the United States imports goods that were produced with Chinese labor. One report in 2010 suggested that international trade was increased when a country hosted a network of immigrants, but the trade effect was weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into their new country.\n\nThe history of international trade chronicles notable events that have affected the trade among various economies.\n\nThere are several models which seek to explain the factors behind international trade, the welfare consequences of trade and the pattern of trade.\n\nThe following table is a list of the 21 largest trading nations according to the World Trade Organization.\n\nSource: International Trade Centre\n\nPresident George W. Bush observed World Trade Week on May 18, 2001, and May 17, 2002. On May 13, 2016, President Barack Obama proclaimed May 15 through May 21, 2016, World Trade Week, 2016. On May 19, 2017, President Donald Trump proclaimed May 21 through May 27, 2017, World Trade Week, 2017. World Trade Week is the third week of May. Every year the President declares that week to be World Trade Week.\n\n\n\nData on the value of exports and imports and their quantities often broken down by detailed lists of products are available in statistical collections on international trade published by the statistical services of intergovernmental and supranational organisations and national statistical institutes. The definitions and methodological concepts applied for the various statistical collections on international trade often differ in terms of definition (e.g. special trade vs. general trade) and coverage (reporting thresholds, inclusion of trade in services, estimates for smuggled goods and cross-border provision of illegal services). Metadata providing information on definitions and methods are often published along with the data.\n\n\n"}

It is now known that he saved Jews during the Holocaust as well.\n\nHochschild was an agnostic Jew whose family had already been active in the mining industry for over a generation. He was the eldest son of a general trader who had two cousins involved in the metal industry: brothers Berthold Hochschild, who founded the American Metal Company and Zachary Hochschild, a partner in Metallgesellschaft. After Hochschild graduated from school, he studied mining and engineering at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. In 1905, he began his career in the field at the large industrial conglomerate Metallgesellschaft. and then as the company's agent in Spain and Australia and then finally moved to South America to work independently. After several years in Chile, he returned to Germany and stayed there until the end of the first World War.\n\nIn 1918, he married Käthe Rosenbaum and in 1920, he returned once again to Bolivia. In 1920, his son, Gerardo Hochschild Rosenbaum, was born; his wife died in 1924. During the following two decades, Hochschild built up an economic empire in Bolivia around the mining and trade of tin ore. His empire stretched from Peru in the north to Chile in the south. During this period of growth, more of his family followed him to South America to work for him, including his cousin Philipp Hochschild and Philipp's wife Germaine. Moritz (or Don Mauricio, as he was known in South America) and Germaine had an affair, and they married after Germaine divorced Philipp.\n\nThe 1930s saw the peak of the Moritz Hochschild Group's economical and political influence. In 1938, using his influence with German Busch, Bolivia's military president from 1937 to 1939, Hochschild pushed Bolivia to open its doors to Jewish refugees from Hitler's Germany. An estimated 9,000 were admitted. Hochschild also funded the transport of the refugees and their housing once they arrived in the South American country. Newspapers have called him \"Bolivia's Schindler.\"\n\nIn both 1939 and 1944, Hochschild was arrested by the Bolivian government and sentenced to death. Just two weeks after his release following his 1944 arrest, he was captured and held by kidnappers for two weeks. After he was freed he left Bolivia, never to return.\n\nIn 1951, the Hochschilds donated the majority of their fortune to the \"Hochschild Trust and Foundation\". In the following year, the Moritz Hochschild Group was nationalized during the Bolivian National Revolution; however, they were compensated with an allotment of 30% of the company's prior assets. The company, Hochschild Mining, grew further and expanded worldwide. In 1961 Hochschild inaugurated Mantos Blancos copper mine in Antofagasta, Chile, which became his most successful mining operation, although its best results were to come after his death.\n\nMauricio Hochschild, who is now being called the 'Bolivian Schindler,' was a Bolivian business tycoon with a reputation as a 'bad guy' facilitated the escape of at least 9,000 Jews from Nazi Germany as recent documents have revealed.

All employers of employees for wages have been required since 1997 to register with their state for reporting, and to report new hires within 20 days of employment, except employers who file new hire reports electronically, who must file a report every 12 to 16 days. The ostensible purpose of the program is to check for \"deadbeat parents\", e.g. persons not paying required child support orders, but may also be used for abuse of other payment-related programs such as unemployment insurance.\n\nAll employers of employees for wages must register with their state's New Hire Registry, and are required to report to the registry all new hires or all rehires of former employees who have been separated from the employer for more than 60 days. All employees must be reported, including employees who were hired or worked for less than one day, domestic employees such as a maid, gardener, cook, etc., and seasonal employees. The law's reporting requirements strictly include all employees for wages. An employer must report all persons who would be considered employees under federal rules for withholding of employment taxes to the state's New Hire Registry. Reporting of independent contractors is not required, but is encouraged.\n\nWhile reporting of employees who are no longer working for the employer may not seem to be helpful, since the report includes the address of the employee, it may be useful in tracking down an employee who has unpaid child support payments or might be committing unemployment insurance fraud.\n\nNo employer is exempt from reporting new hires, with the exception of Federal intelligence agencies where the director of the agency has determined that reporting may jeopardize the safety of certain employees or may compromise National Security.\n\nThe report which is required to be filed includes the name, address and social security number of every new hire, as well as the name, address, and Federal Employer Identification Number of the employer, for each new hire made within the last 20 days or within the last two weeks for employers filing electronically.\n\nAn employer within a single state files with the New Hire Registry of the state where they operate; multistate employers may choose to either file new hire reports with each state where the employee works, or instead may file a single combined report for all employees for all states where it operates with one state's New Hire Registry, but must not make both reports.\n"}
{"id": "423640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=423640", "title": "Paperboard", "text": "Paperboard\n\nPaperboard is a thick paper-based material. While there is no rigid differentiation between paper and paperboard, paperboard is generally thicker (usually over 0.30 mm, 0.012 in, or 12 points) than paper and has certain superior attributes such as foldability and rigidity. According to ISO standards, paperboard is a paper with a grammage above 250 g/m, but there are exceptions. Paperboard can be single- or multi-ply. \n\nPaperboard can be easily cut and formed, is lightweight, and because it is strong, is used in packaging. Another end-use is high quality graphic printing, such as book and magazine covers or postcards. Paperboard is also used in fine arts for creating sculptures.\n\nSometimes it is referred to as \"cardboard\", which is a generic, lay term used to refer to any heavy paper pulp–based board, however this usage is deprecated in the paper, printing and packaging industries as it does not adequately describe each product type.\n\nIn 1817, the first paperboard carton was produced in England. Folding cartons first emerged around the 1860s and were shipped flat to save space, ready to be set up by customers when they were required. 1879 saw the development of mechanical die cutting and creasing of blanks. In 1911 the first kraft sulphate mill was built in Florida. In 1915 the gable top milk carton was patented and in 1935 the first dairy plant was observed using them. Ovenable paperboard was introduced in 1974.\n\nTerminology and classifications of paperboard are not always uniform. Differences occur depending on specific industry, locale, and personal choice. In general, the following are often used:\n\nFibrous material is turned into pulp (paper)/pulp and bleaching of wood bleached, to create one or more layers of board, which can be optionally coated for a better surface and/or improved visual appearance. pulp board are produced on pulping machines that can handle higher grammage and several plies.\n\nThe above-mentioned fibrous material can either come from fresh (virgin) sources (e.g. wood) or from recycled waste paper. Around 90% of virgin paper is made from wood pulp.\nToday paperboard packaging in general, and especially products from certified sustainable sources, are receiving new attention, as manufacturers dealing with environmental, health, and regulatory issues look to renewable resources to meet increasing demand. It is now mandatory in many countries for paper-based packaging to be manufactured wholly or partially from recycled material.\nRaw materials include:\n\n\n\nTwo principal methods for extracting fibres from their sources are:\n\n\nPulp used in the manufacture of paperboard can be bleached to decrease colour and increase purity. Virgin fibre pulp is naturally brown in colour, because of the presence of lignin. Recycled paperboard may contain traces of inks, bonding agents and other residue which colors it grey.\nAlthough bleaching is not necessary for all end-uses, it is vital for many graphical and packaging purposes. There are various methods of bleaching, which are used according to a number of factors for example, the degree of colour change required, chemicals chosen and method of treatment. There are three categories of bleaching methods:\n\n\nMulti-ply paperboard generally has higher creasing and folding performance than single-ply as a result of layering different types of pulp into a single product. In cases where the same kind of pulp is being used in several layers, each separate layer is treated and shaped individually in order to create the highest possible quality.\n\nIn order to improve whiteness, smoothness and gloss of paperboard, one or more layers of coating is applied. Coated paper is usually made up of:\n\n\nAdditional components could be OBA (optical brightening agents).\n\nThe DIN Standard 19303 \"Paperboard - Terms and grades\" (Publication date : 2005-09) defines different grades of paperboard based on the surface treatment (first letter), the main furnish (second letter) and the colour (non-D grade) or bulk (D grade only) (numbering).\n\nExample: GC1 would be a \"pigment coated\", \"virgin mechanical pulp\" board with a \"white reverse side\". Often the used paperboard type would be FBB, which was coated on both sides.\n\nBasis Weight (US): Is the weight in of paperboard.\n\nBrightness: Brightness is a technical term that is defined as the amount of blue-white light that a paper reflects. This property is very subjective and individual to each buyer and end use, as skin colour and food are better reproduced on ‘warm’ (yellow) whites and not blue whites.\n\nGrammage: The grammage of the paperboard is assessed in accordance ISO 536.\nGrammage expresses mass per unit area and is measured in g/m.\n\nPH: Surface pH is measured on a water extract and is on a scale of 0–14. 0 is acidic, 7 is neutral and 14 is alkaline.\n\nStiffness: Stiffness is one of the most important properties of paperboard as it affects the ability of cartons to run smoothly through the machine that erects, fills and closes them. Stiffness also gives strength and reduces the propensity of a carton to bulge under the weight of settling flowable contents such as cereals.\n\nAlthough most paper strength properties increase with increasing sheet density, stiffness does not. A rule of thumb is that stiffness is proportional to the 1.6 power of sheet caliper.\n\nThe species of fiber used has an effect on stiffness, other things being equal. Northern softwood species impart superior stiffness compared to southern softwoods.\n\nOther factors which affect board stiffness include coatings and moisture content.\n\nSmoothness: Smoothness is particularly important when being used for printing, the smoother the paperboard, the better the image quality, because of better ink coverage. Smoothness is measured using air leak methods – the greater the rate of air leakage, at a specific air pressure, from under a cylindrical knife placed on the surface, the rougher the surface.\n\nCaliper/Thickness: In the United States caliper is usually expressed in thousandths of an inch (0.001”) or points, where a sheet of paperboard with a thickness of 0.024” would be 24 points. In Europe it is often sold in g/m, however the thickness of the board is measured in micron (μm).\n\nPaperboard also tends to be referred to with thickness rather than weight.\n\nWhiteness: It refers ideally to the equal presence of all colours, because a truly white sheet will reflect all wavelengths of visible light equally.\n\nThe paperboard sector is mainly looked at in conjunction with the paper industry. The Paper & Paperboard market size (2007) had a value of 630.9 billion USD and a volume of 320.3 million metric tons. Of that market 40.1% is European. About 50% of all produced paper is used for packaging, followed by printing and writing. According to ProCarton, the consumption of paper and paperboard seem to correlate with economic trends (GDP). Sales of carton in Europe sum up to around 8 billion Euros worth. Over 1,100 printers produce 5.4 million tonnes of cartonboard yearly. Cartons make up one third of paper and board packaging and 15% of all packaging. A bit more than half (54%) of the European carton is produced using recovered fibre or waste paper.\nThe paper and paperboard industry is quite energy and capital intensive. Just a coated board machine itself can cost around 90 - 120 million Euros\n(about 125 - 166 million USD in 11/2011). Economies of scale apply, because of which a few large players often dominate the market place. E.g. in North America the top 5 producers have a market share of 85%.\n\n\n\n"}

The district includes the Women's City Club, the Detroit Building, and the Park Avenue House. The district was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1996 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.\n\nIn the 1920s, Detroit's prestigious Grand Circus Park was crowded with buildings. The automotive boom in the city increased the pressure for office space, and development began to spill north from Grand Circus Park up Park Avenue. In 1922, Albert Kahn designed the Park Avenue Building, located at the entrance to Park Avenue (but included in the neighboring Grand Circus Park Historic District). Other architects and artisans contributed hotels, apartment buildings, and office buildings to the structures on Park Avenue.\n\nIn 1923, the Park Avenue Association was formed. They planned the street to concentrate high-grade commercial and office space at the south end, and prestigious residential development at the north end. As the district developed, Detroiters consciously perceived it as their city's version of New York City's Fifth Avenue.\n\nAlso on Park Avenue was Women's City Club and the Detroit chapter of the Colony Club, both critical in providing women with social and work activities and supporting women's suffrage.\n\nThe area was used decreasingly during the Great Depression, but saw a resurgence after World War II, with a mix of social groups and multiple restaurant and entertainment venues. At the same time, an industrial character was added to the district when the Iodent Chemical Company began manufacturing toothpaste in a building along Park Avenue. The proximity of the Fox Theatre and other nearby venues (including Comerica Park) has led to increased redevelopment in the 2000s. The Iodent Building has been redeveloped into lofts, the Colony Club has been refurbished, and two new entertainment venues, Cliff Bell's and the Park Bar, have opened.\n\nThe district was listed on the state register of historic places in 1996, and on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.\n\nThe Park Avenue Historic District contains thirteen buildings. Two of these (the Women's City Club and the Park Avenue House) are separately listed on the National Register. Two additional buildings on either side of Park Avenue at West Adams (the Park Avenue Building and the Kales Building), are located within the Grand Circus Park Historic District, and thus not included in this district.\n\n"}
{"id": "5055577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5055577", "title": "Park Row (Manhattan)", "text": "Park Row (Manhattan)\n\nPark Row is a street located in the Financial District, Civic Center, and Chinatown neighborhoods of the New York City borough of Manhattan. The street runs east-west, sometimes called north-south because the western end is nearer to Downtown Manhattan. At the north end of Park Row is the confluence of Bowery, East Broadway, St. James Place, Oliver Street, Mott Street, and Worth Street at Chatham Square. At the street's south end, Broadway, Vesey Street, Barclay Street, and Ann Street intersect. The intersection includes a bus turnaround loop designated as Millennium Park. Park Row was once known as Chatham Street; it was renamed Park Row in 1886, a reference to the fact that it faces City Hall Park, the former New York Common.\n\nIn the late 18th century Eastern Post Road became the more important road connecting New York to Albany and New England. This section of the road which became Park Row was called Chatham Street, a name that enters into the city's history on numerous occasions.\n\nThe tobacco industry in New York City got its start in 1760, when Pierre Lorillard opened a snuff factory on Chatham Street, and in 1795, the Long Room of Abraham Martling's Tavern on Chatham Street was one of the first headquarters used by the Tammany Society and the Democratic-Republican Party on election days. Those who gathered there became known as \"Martling Men\", \"Tammanyites\" or \"Bucktails\", especially during the time that Tammany was attempting to wrest control of the party away from governor De Witt Clinton. In the 1780s, Chatham Street was the site of the Tea Water Pump, a privately owned company which took water from Fresh Water Pond, the city's only supply of fresh water, and which remained purer longer than some of the other sources which drew from the pond.\n\nChatham Street was also a center for entertainment. In 1798, Marc Isambard Brunel designed the 2,000-seat Park Theater on Chatham Street, intended to attract the upper classes of the city. The theater cost $130,000 to build, and tickets were 25 cents for seats in the gallery, and 50 cents in the orchestra. In the early 1800s, more taverns, theaters and small hotels on the street started to offer free entertain to attract customers to drink. These were called \"free and easies\", \"varieties\" or \"vaudeville\" and offered numerous different kinds of performances: comedy, dance, dramatic skits, magic, music, ventriloquism, and tellers of tall tales. New theaters such as the Chatham Theater sprang up as well to attract the overflow from the entertainment strip on the Bowery. Boxing was also a popular entertainment. The Arena on Park Row packed in fans with its nightly presentation of \"the manly art\".\n\nChatham Street was also the site of several anti-African American incidents, as in the Draft Riots of 1863, in which rioters were repulsed in their attempt to attack black waiters at Crook's Restaurant on the street.\n\nBy the mid-1800s, Chatham Street had a bazaar-like atmosphere from the many used clothing shops and pawnbrokerages open by recently immigrated Jews from Germany and central Europe. This gave rise to anti-Semitic caricatures, although many New Yorkers could not distinguish German Jews from other Germans.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Joseph Pulitzer, later the publisher of the \"New York World\" newspaper, but then a recent immigrant from Hungary who had volunteered to serve in the Union cavalry, was thrown out of the elegant French's Hotel on Chatham Street at Frankfort Street. In 1888, Pulitzer bought the hotel and had it razed in order to build a new headquarters for the \"World\". The New York World Building – also known as the \"Pulitzer Building\" – designed by George Browne Post, opened in 1890, with the governor and the mayor in attendance to celebrate the 309-foot tallest building in the world, topped by a gilded dome, the first building in the city to be taller than Trinity Church. Pulitzer's own semi-circular office was at the top of the building and featured frescoes on the ceiling, embossed leather walls, and three large windows. The \"World\" folded in 1931, to become part of the \"New York World Telegram\", then the \"New York World-Telegram & Sun\", and, finally, in 1966, the \"New York World Journal Tribune\", which represented the amalgamation of seven previously independent competing newspapers. The World Building became just another office building, which was torn down in 1955 to make way for an expanded car ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nChatham Street was no stranger to poverty. In 1890, Jacob Riis revealed in \"How the Other Half Lives\" that over 9,000 homeless men lodged nightly on Chatham Street and the Bowery, between City Hall and the Cooper Union.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Chatham Street was nicknamed Newspaper Row, as most of New York City's newspapers located on the street to be close to City Hall. Early in the 19th century most of the Manhattan portion of the street was suppressed, the Commons became City Hall Park, and the stub of a street was renamed Park Row.\n\nAfter the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, Park Row was the site of the large Park Row Terminal for the elevated trains and cable-hauled shuttle cars which crossed the bridge. Service was gradually reduced from 1913 to 1940, and the terminal was demolished in 1944.\n\nPart of the southern section of the street was known as Printing House Square. Today, a statue of Benjamin Franklin by Ernst Plassman stands there, in front of the One Pace Plaza and 41 Park Row buildings of Pace University, holding a copy of his \"Pennsylvania Gazette\", a reminder of what Park Row once was.\n\n\"The New York Times\" was originally located at 113 Nassau Street in 1851. It moved to 138 Nassau Street in 1854, and in 1858 it moved a little more than one block away to 41 Park Row, possibly making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use. The New York Times Building, which was designed by George B. Post, was designated a New York City landmark in 1999. The building is now used by Pace University.\n\nThe \"New Yorker Staats-Zeitung\" moved to its own building at at very nearly the same time as the \"Times\" moved into its new building.\n\nOne of the first structures to be called a skyscraper, the Park Row Building (also known as 15 Park Row) is located at the western end of Park Row, opposite City Hall Park. Designed by noted architect R. H. Robertson, and built in 1896-99, It was designated a city landmark in 1999. At tall it was the tallest office building in the world from 1899 until 1908, when it was surpassed by the Singer Building. The building is 29 stories tall, with 26 full floors and two, three-story cupolas. It has a frontage of on Park Row, 23 on Ann Street and on Theater Alley. The base of the building covers a land area of approximately .\n\nThe Potter Building at 38 Park Row (145 Nassau Street) was built in 1882-86 and designated a New York City landmark in 1996. It was built after the owner's previous building on the site burned down. The Potter Building was converted into apartments between 1979 and 1981.\n\nThe New York City Police Department is headquartered at 1 Police Plaza located on Park Row, across the street from the Manhattan Municipal Building and Metropolitan Correctional Center.\n\nTwo apartment buildings of significance on Park Row are the Chatham Towers at no. 170, built in 1965 and designed by Kelly & Gruzen, which, according to the \"AIA Guide to New York City\", makes a \"strong architectural statement...[which] rouses great admiration and great criticism,\" and Chatham Green at 185 Park Row, built in 1961 and also designed by Kelly & Gruzen.\n\nThe segment of Park Row between Frankfort Street and Chatham Square is only open to MTA buses and government and emergency vehicles. The section of Park Row has been closed to civilian traffic since the September 11 attacks in 2001. The NYPD asserts that this is necessary to protect its headquarters from a truck bomb attack. Chinatown residents are increasingly frustrated at the disruption caused by the closure of the thoroughfare, especially nearby residents. People who live nearby argue that the police department has placed a chokehold on an entire neighborhood and suggest One Police Plaza be moved from a residential area. Members of the Civic Center Residents Coalition have been fighting the security perimeter around the building for years.\n\nThe NYPD has stated that it will not move despite the numerous complaints from residents, explaining that they had tried to alleviate the impact of the security measures by forbidding officers from parking in nearby public spaces and reopening a stairway that skirts the headquarter's south side and leads down to street level near the Brooklyn Bridge. The department also plans to redesign its guard booths and security barriers to make them more attractive, and was involved in efforts to convert two lanes of Park Row into a cycling and pedestrian greenway which opened in June, 2018.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "169592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169592", "title": "Peggy Guggenheim", "text": "Peggy Guggenheim\n\nMarguerite \"Peggy\" Guggenheim (August 26, 1898 – December 23, 1979) was an American art collector, bohemian and socialite. Born to the wealthy New York City Guggenheim family, she was the daughter of Benjamin Guggenheim, who went down with the \"Titanic\" in 1912, and the niece of Solomon R. Guggenheim, who would establish the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Peggy Guggenheim created a noted art collection in Europe and America primarily between 1938 and 1946. She exhibited this collection as she built it and in 1949, settled in Venice, where she lived and exhibited her collection for the rest of her life. The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is a modern art museum on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, and is one of the most visited attractions in Venice.\n\nBoth of Peggy's parents were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Her mother, Florette Seligman (1870–1937), was a member of the Seligman family. When she turned 21 in 1919, Peggy Guggenheim inherited US$2.5 million, about US$ million in today's currency. Guggenheim's father, Benjamin Guggenheim, a member of the Guggenheim family, died in the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\", and he had not amassed the fortune of his siblings; therefore her inheritance was far less than the vast wealth of her cousins.\n\nShe first worked as a clerk in an avant-garde bookstore, the Sunwise Turn, where she became enamored of the members of the bohemian artistic community. In 1920 she went to live in Paris, France. Once there, she became friendly with avant-garde writers and artists, many of whom were living in poverty in the Montparnasse quarter of the city. Man Ray photographed her, and was, along with Constantin Brâncuși and Marcel Duchamp, a friend whose art she was eventually to promote.\n\nShe became close friends with writer Natalie Barney and artist Romaine Brooks, and was a regular at Barney's stylish salon. She met Djuna Barnes during this time, and in time became her friend and patron. Barnes wrote her best-known novel, \"Nightwood,\" while staying at the Devon country house, Hayford Hall, that Guggenheim had rented for two summers.\n\nPeggy urged Emma Goldman to write her autobiography and helped to secure funds for her to focus in Saint-Tropez, France, on writing her two volume \"Living My Life\".\n\nIn January 1938, Guggenheim opened a gallery for modern art in London featuring Jean Cocteau drawings in its first show, and began to collect works of art. Guggenheim often purchased at least one object from each of her exhibitions at the gallery. After the outbreak of World War II, she purchased as much abstract and Surrealist art as possible.\n\nHer first gallery was called \"Guggenheim Jeune\", the name being ingeniously chosen to associate the epitome of a gallery, the French Bernheim-Jeune, with the name of her own well known family. The gallery on 30 Cork Street, next to Roland Penrose's and E. L. T. Mesens' show-case for the Surrealist movement, the London Gallery, proved to be successful, thanks to many friends who gave advice and who helped run the gallery. Marcel Duchamp, whom she had known since the early 1920s, when she lived in Paris with her first husband Laurence Vail, had introduced Guggenheim to the art world; it was through him that she met many artists during her frequent visits to Paris. He taught her about contemporary art and styles, and he conceived several of the exhibitions held at \"Guggenheim Jeune\".\n\nThe Cocteau exhibition was followed by exhibitions on Wassily Kandinsky (his first one-man-show in England), Yves Tanguy, Wolfgang Paalen and several other well-known and some lesser-known artists. Peggy Guggenheim also held group exhibitions of sculpture and collage, with the participation of the now classic moderns Antoine Pevsner, Henry Moore, Henri Laurens, Alexander Calder, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Constantin Brâncuși, Jean Arp, Max Ernst, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Kurt Schwitters. She also greatly admired the work of John Tunnard (1900–1971) and is credited with his discovery in mainstream international modernism.\n\nWhen Peggy Guggenheim realized that her gallery, although well received, had made a loss of £600 in the first year, she decided to spend her money in a more practical way. A museum for contemporary arts was exactly the institution she could see herself supporting. Most certainly on her mind also were the adventures in New York City of her uncle, Solomon R. Guggenheim, who, with the help and encouragement of Hilla Rebay, had created the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation two years earlier. The main aim of this foundation had been to collect and to further the production of abstract art, resulting in the opening of the Museum of Non-objective Painting (from 1952: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) earlier in 1939 on East 54th Street in Manhattan. Peggy Guggenheim closed \"Guggenheim Jeune\" with a farewell party on 22 June 1939, at which colour portrait photographs by Gisèle Freund were projected on the walls. She started making plans for a Museum of Modern Art in London together with the English art historian and art critic Herbert Read. She set aside $40,000 for the museum's running costs. However, these funds were soon overstretched with the organisers' ambitions.\n\nIn August 1939, Peggy Guggenheim left for Paris to negotiate loans of artworks for the first exhibition. In her luggage was a list drawn up by Herbert Read for this occasion. Shortly after her departure the Second World War broke out, and the events following 1 September 1939 made her abandon the scheme, willingly or not. She then \"decided now to buy paintings by all the painters who were on Herbert Read's list. Having plenty of time and all the museum's funds at my disposal, I put myself on a regime to buy one picture a day.\"\nWhen finished, she had acquired ten Picassos, forty Ernsts, eight Mirós, four Magrittes, three Man Rays, three Dalís, one Klee, one Wolfgang Paalen and one Chagall among others. In the meantime, she had also made new plans and in April 1940 had rented a large space in the Place Vendôme as a new home for her museum.\n\nA few days before the Germans reached Paris, Peggy Guggenheim had to abandon her plans for a Paris museum, and fled to the south of France, from where, after months of safeguarding her collection and artist friends, she left Europe for New York in the summer of 1941. There, in the following year, she opened a new gallery which actually was in part a museum at 30 West 57th Street. It was called The Art of This Century Gallery. Three of the four galleries were dedicated to Cubist and Abstract art, Surrealism and Kinetic art, with only the fourth, the front room, being a commercial gallery. Peggy Guggenheim held important shows, such as the show for 31 Women artists, at the gallery as well.\n\nHer interest in new art was instrumental in advancing the careers of several important modern artists including the American painters Jackson Pollock and William Congdon, the Austrian surrealist Wolfgang Paalen, the sound poet Ada Verdun Howell and the German painter Max Ernst, whom she married in December 1941. She had assembled her collection in only seven years.\n\nFollowing World War II – and her 1946 divorce from Max Ernst – she closed The Art of This Century Gallery in 1947, and returned to Europe; deciding to live in Venice, Italy. In 1948, she was invited to exhibit her collection in the disused Greek Pavilion of the Venice Biennale and in 1949 established herself in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni ('unfinished palazzo of the lions') on the Grand Canal.\n\nHer collection became one of the few European collections of modern art to promote a significant number of works by Americans. In the 1950s she promoted the art of two local painters, Edmondo Bacci and Tancredi Parmeggiani. By the early 1960s, Guggenheim had almost stopped collecting art and began to concentrate on presenting what she already owned. She loaned out her collection to museums in Europe and in 1969 to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which was named after her uncle. Eventually, she decided to donate her home and her collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, a gift which was concluded \"inter vivos\" in 1976, before her death in 1979.\nThe Peggy Guggenheim Collection is one of the most important museums in Italy for European and American art of the first half of the 20th century. Pieces in her collection embrace Cubism, Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism.\n\nPeggy Guggenheim lived in Venice until her death in Camposampiero near Padua, Italy, after a stroke. Her ashes are interred in the garden (later: Nasher Sculpture Garden) of her home, the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni (inside the Peggy Guggenheim Collection), next to her beloved dogs.\n\nAccording to both Guggenheim and her biographer Anton Gill, she had a considerable sexual appetite and it was believed that, while living in Europe, she had \"slept with 1,000 men\". She claimed to have had affairs with numerous artists and writers, and in return many artists and others have claimed affairs with her. In her autobiography, Peggy provides the names of some of these lovers, including Yves Tanguy, Roland Penrose and E. L. T. Mesens.\n\nHer first marriage was to Laurence Vail, a Dada sculptor and writer with whom she had two children, Michael Cedric Sindbad Vail (1923–1986) and Pegeen Vail Guggenheim. They divorced about 1928 following his affair with writer Kay Boyle, whom he later married. Soon after her first marriage dissolved, she had an affair with John Ferrar Holms, a writer with writer's block who had been a war hero. Starting in December 1939, she and Samuel Beckett had a brief but intense affair, and he encouraged her to turn exclusively to modern art. She married her second husband, painter Max Ernst, in 1941 and divorced him in 1946. Among her eight grandchildren is Karole Vail, who was appointed director of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in 2017.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

He was three years old when his grandfather, R. R. M. Carpenter Sr., bought the Phillies in 1943 and gave control of the team to his father, Bob. He graduated from Yale University in 1962 where he earned two varsity football letters, and joined his father in the Phillies' front office in 1963. In 1965, he suggested that his father hire Paul Owens, a young scout, as farm system director. Owens would eventually become general manager in 1972.\n\nRuly became team president at 32, when his father stepped down in the 1972 season. His tenure as owner was, statistically speaking, one of the most (if not the most) successful in franchise history. From 1976 to 1980, the Phillies won their division in every season but one, including the team's first World Series win in 1980. They also won the first half National League East title in the strike-shortened 1981 season.\n\nSoon after the World Series triumph, however, Carpenter decided to sell the team. With the advent of free agency, salaries were already starting to spiral upward, and he believed that even with his considerable wealth he needed to take on minority investors in order to stay afloat. Unwilling to have to get permission from partners in order to make major decisions, he sold the Phillies to a group headed by longtime Phillies executive Bill Giles for $32.5 million in 1981. By comparison, his grandfather had bought the team in 1943 for $400,000.\n\nCarpenter still lives in Wilmington. He is a longtime member of the University of Delaware Board of Trustees; his family has supported the school for many years. He is still an avid Phillies fan, and closely followed the team's run to its second world title in 2008. He was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\nCarpenter's great-grandmother, Margaretta Carpenter, was the sister of Pierre S. du Pont, president of DuPont from 1915 to 1919.\n\n"}

She works closely with co-director Alex Kahn. The couple's work, under the informal moniker \"Superior Concept Monsters\" has been commissioned each year since 1998 to lead New York's Village Halloween Parade, the largest puppet parade and street-pageant of its kind in the United States, drawing two million spectators.\n\nMany of the giant rod puppets (or \"pageant\" puppets) created by Michahelles and Kahn, are lit from the inside, making them suitable for night parades. They are performed by teams of puppeteers. For the 1998 Halloween parade, Michahelles worked with Kahn and his team to build five 20-foot caterpillar puppets (designed by Kahn) which transformed into giant Luna moths. In 2001, as a response to the attack on the World Trade Center, Michahelles herself designed an incandescent baby phoenix puppet for the New York parade, as a symbol of rebirth from the ashes.\n\nMichahelles has also worked in collaboration with master puppeteer Basil Twist. She performed in Twist's Off-Broadway show \"Symphonie fantastique\" (1998 and 2004) presented at Dodger Stages. The Obie Award-winning work is a water ballet of 180 puppets choreographed to the five movements of Hector Berlioz's 1830 orchestral work. Unseen during the performance, she and the other five performers \"...emerge from behind the scenes for their curtain calls... Each is wearing a wetsuit, looks exhausted, gets naked and is soaked from head to toe,\" according to theater critic Matthew Murray of TalkinBroadway.com.\n\nSince 2002, Michahelles and Kahn have taught a summer workshop in pageant puppetry and processional art in the mountain village of Morinesio, located in the Italian Alps. They draw on local history as an inspiration for the artistic themes of the puppet creations and folk festivals that are part of the workshop. This process of creating locally derived, site-specific processions has become a central aspect of their work, and in 2005, they formed a non-profit entity, Processional Arts Workshop, to further pursue community-based projects.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12672071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12672071", "title": "The labor problem", "text": "The labor problem\n\n\"The labor problem\" is the economics term widely used toward the turn of the twentieth century with various applications. It has been defined in many ways, such as \"the problem of improving the conditions of employment of the wage-earning classes.\" It encompasses the difficulties faced by wage-earners and employers who began to cut wages for various reasons including increased technology, desire for lower costs or to stay in business. The wage-earning classes responded with strikes, by unionizing and by committing acts of outright violence. It was a nationwide problem that spanned nearly all industries and helped contribute to modern business conditions still seen today. Possible causes include the failure to account for the negative externality of reproduction in the face of finite natural resources which results in over-supply of labor and falling living standards for wage-laborers, depersonalization by machines and poor working conditions.\n\nA popular debate about the labor problem is the time that it encompasses. Some characterize it back as far as the 1860s, which is when many unions and groups began to form. However there wasn’t a problem present at this time with the formation of these unions. Also, the first strike was a result of the problem between wage earners and union officials, not employers and unions or employers and wage-earners, which was the main conflict of this time. Since the problem was within unions and not between unions and employers, the Labor Problem had not yet become an issue. Many also attribute the end of the problem to the end of the 1920s. This has some merit but is also open to interpretation. Reforms began to pass to correct many of the problems but reforms continued to pass well into the 1930s, 40s and 50s. The Civil Rights Movement took over in America, which brought about even further legislation. Many attribute the end of the labor problem to the late 1920s because it marks a significant drop in strikes and violence and an increase in passed legislation aimed at correcting the labor issues.\n\nAt the turn of the century machines were beginning to take a stronger footing in the economy, which drove costs down. Always trying to maximize profits, employers saw fit to lower wages for two main reasons. Machines were making the production process cheaper meaning wages took up a bigger percentage of costs, and when times were particularly tough, it made sense to cut wages to stay in business. This depersonalization of the production process meant that people essentially became expendable. People were not eliminated completely but there was a significant job loss. This led to lower wages in the long run because fixed costs decreased (with increased technology) so employers saw fit to cut wage expenses for this now partially expendable labor force. Although the problem spanned many industries, they were not all concerned with the same problems. For example, the steel industry was mainly concerned with being phased out due to technological advances while other industries, namely textiles, had problems with child labor and working conditions. The variety of problems and concerns led to legislation being passed, which covered different areas and led to greater reform.\n\nRiots broke out in Baltimore in 1877 due to the negligence of union officials. It began as a railroad strike but eventually formed riots that lasted four days and killed fifty people. The first strike due to depersonalization by machines was the Homestead Strike in 1892 on the Carnegie Steel Company by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA). This ultimately resulted in the attempted assassination of Henry Clay Frick, Chairman of The Carnegie Steel Company, and a crushing blow in the attempt to unionize steel workers. Another example is the Pullman Strike in 1894, where almost 4,000 workers who were members of the American Railway Union (ARU) went on a strike without permission of the union to protest wage cuts by the Pullman Company. One extreme example occurred when train engineers and laborer stopped a train before it reached the station in New York City, stranding men, women and children alike in the heat.\n\nLegislation like the Wagner Act (1935) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (1938) were passed which forced employers to participate in collective bargaining and presented a minimum wage respectively. Child Labor laws have also been reformed, limiting the age at which children can begin work and what type of work they can perform. The Department of Labor was established in 1913. While some pieces of legislation like the aforementioned Wagner Act and Fair Labor Standards Act weren’t passed until the 1930s, their roots trace back to this Labor Problem at the turn of the century when demand for reform was growing in popularity. Many aspects of modern business like an established 40-hour work week, overtime pay, collective bargaining and safer working conditions among numerous other reforms can all trace their roots back to this time period and the legislation passed to correct it.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Delaware General Assembly, the founder of the Du Pont, Bauduy & Co., wool manufacturers, and brother of Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, the founder of the E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company.\n\nVictor du Pont was born October 1, 1767 in Paris, France, son of Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours and Nicole Charlotte Marie Louise le Dée. He married Gabrielle Joséphine de la Fite de Pelleport in 1794 and had five children, Amélie-Élisabeth (1796-1869), Samuel Francis (born and died 1799), Charles Irénée (1803-1865), Samuel Francis (1803-1865) and Julia Sophie (1806-1882).\n\nAfter 1784 du Pont worked with his father in King Louis XVI's Bureau of Commerce. There he had opportunities to travel around Europe and meet visiting friends of his father. In 1788 he began four years of work with the French minister to the United States in both New York City and Philadelphia. During this time, he wrote letters to his father analyzing the U.S. Constitution and the prospects for its ratification. Returning to Paris in 1793, he married and soon went back to the United States, this time as French Consul at Charleston, South Carolina. He remained there until 1797 when he was named French Consul-General at Philadelphia, but being refused recognition by President John Adams, he returned to France.\n\nFor the next two years Victor du Pont assisted his father in his preparation for the whole family immigrating to the United States. They finally sailed on the \"American Eagle\", arriving in Newport, Rhode Island, January 1, 1800. From there the father, two brothers, and wives and children, went to live at \"Goodstay,\" a house purchased for them in Bergen Point, New Jersey. Many ideas for future du Pont businesses were conceived in the coming year at \"Goodstay,\" including the one that had his brother, Eleuthère, beginning a gunpowder business. Victor and his brother returned to France for a year in 1801 to seek investors for that and various other prospects. He returned to New York, established a trading company, Victor du Pont de Nemours & Co., and acted as an agent for Louis Pichon, the French Consul-General and chargé d'affairs, provisioning French troops seeking to quell the rebellion then going on in Santo Domingo. This firm went into bankruptcy in 1808, as his many advances, including those to the French government, went unreimbursed. Victor next tried his hand at farming and merchandising on the Genesee River valley of western New York.\n\nIn 1811, he moved with his family to Delaware and established residence at \"Louviers\" on the Brandywine Creek, across from the Eleutherian Mills of his brother. He established a woolen mill to manufacture cotton cloth. Eleuthère's partner, Pierre Bauduy and son-law-law, Ferdinand Bauduy, joined the business in 1813, and it became known as Du Pont, Bauduy & Co. Soon after arriving in Delaware, Victor du Pont was elected to one of the New Castle County seats in the State House for the 1815, 1816, and 1817 sessions and later was elected to the State Senate for the 1821, 1822, and 1823 sessions.\n\nVictor du Pont died in Philadelphia on January 30, 1827, and is buried in the du Pont family cemetery near Greenville, Delaware. Victor du Pont was a man \"whose friends were everywhere.\" His son Charles took over management of the wool manufacturing business upon his death, and his other son, Samuel Francis, was a Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}
