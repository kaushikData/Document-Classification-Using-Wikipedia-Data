In 1989, he founded Best Buddies International, an international organization that helps people with intellectual disabilities to find employment and social opportunities. Through his mother, he is a nephew of World War II casualty Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Senator Ted Kennedy.\n\nShriver was born July 20, 1965 in Boston, Massachusetts to Eunice Kennedy Shriver and Sargent Shriver, Jr. His mother is the founder of Special Olympics and his father is a founding director of the Peace Corps. Through his mother, he is a nephew of World War II casualty Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Kathleen Kennedy Cavendish, and Senator Ted Kennedy. Anthony Shriver is the youngest of five children.\n\nHe graduated from the Georgetown Preparatory School in 1984. He then attended Brown University before transferring to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., from which he graduated in 1988 with a double major in theology and history.\n\nShriver is the founder and chairman of Best Buddies International a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization which he created in 1989. Best Buddies is a nonprofit organization that provides adults and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities social inclusion and job opportunities. He has been able to get the organization to spread throughout the world and it has over 1500 chapters today. Shriver spoke in 2008 about the all-inclusive nature of the program:\n\"The great thing about Best Buddies is there’s something for everybody. You can be a volunteer in some shape, form or fashion, whether you’re volunteering to get your kids involved, whether your son or daughter is involved in their school program, whether you want to be a mentor yourself as an adult, whether you want to get an online Buddy, whether you’re an employer and want to hire someone with a disability to work in your office—if you’ve got any sense of motivation and determination and want to give back, there’s a role for you at Best Buddies, which I think is pretty unique. Even in Special Olympics, for most people, you can be a coach or a spectator, but you’re not going to run the 50-yard dash. In Best Buddies, you’re running the 50-yard dash with your Buddy. People get a different level of experience by participating, as opposed to writing a check, though that’s important, too. But beyond writing checks, we need people to get involved and give their time.\"\n\nBest Buddies has grown into a leading nonprofit entity with increasing international reach across six continents; establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment and leadership development for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\nIn addition, Anthony and his brother Timothy (the chairman of the Special Olympics) have recently aligned Best Buddies and the Special Olympics to create the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Challenge event, aimed to encourage greater acceptance and inclusion for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Shriver has also been a director of UniCapital Corp. since March 1998. UniCapital Corp. is an investment house.\n\nHe is currently on the board of directors of Level Brands.\n\nShriver - along with most members of the extended Kennedy family - is a part of the Democratic Party. In 2005, he considered running for Governor of Florida in the 2006 election. He was said to have considered a run for Governor of Florida in the 2010 election.\n\nShriver married Alina Mojica (born January 5, 1965, in Pinar Del Rio, Cuba) on July 2, 1993, in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. He resides in Miami Beach, together with Alina and their five children: Anthony Paul Kennedy Shriver, Jr. (born September 4, 1988), Eunice Julia Shriver (born January 4, 1994), Francesca Maria Shriver (born December 12, 1994), Carolina Fitzgerald Kennedy Shriver (born June 28, 2001), and John Joseph Sargent Shriver (born July 1, 2009).\n\n\n"}

It was built in 1977 to house the headquarters of Citibank. It is 915 feet (279 m) tall, and has 59 floors with 1.3 million square feet (120,000 m²) of office space.\n\nThe building is one of the most distinctive and imposing in New York's skyline, thanks to a 45° angled top and a unique stilt-style base. It was designed by architect Hugh Stubbins and structural engineer William LeMessurier. The building is currently owned by Boston Properties, and in 2009, was renamed 601 Lexington Avenue.\n\nThe northwest corner of the site was originally occupied by St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church which was founded in 1862 (as the Deutsche Evangelische Lutherische Sanct Petri-Kirche, the original church building was sold and demolished to construct the Grand Central Terminal in 1903). In 1905, the church moved to the location of 54th Street and Lexington Avenue, where it remained until the building was purchased by First National City Bank (later known as Citibank) in 1970.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Citigroup Center was an engineering challenge. When planning for the skyscraper began in the early 1970s, the northwest corner of the proposed building site was occupied by St. Peter's Lutheran Church. The church allowed Citicorp to demolish the old church and build the skyscraper under one condition: a new church would have to be built on the same corner, with no connection to the Citicorp building and no columns passing through it, because the church wanted to remain on the site of the new development, near one of the intersections. Architects wondered at the time if this demand was too much and would make the proposal unfeasible.\n\nStructural engineer William LeMessurier set the 59-story tower on four massive columns, 114 feet (35 meters) high, positioned at the center of each side, rather than at the corners. This design allowed the corners of the building to cantilever 72 feet (22 meters), providing space at the northwest corner for the new church. To help accomplish this, LeMessurier employed a system of stacked load-bearing braces, in the form of inverted chevrons. Each chevron is designed to distribute tension loads (due to wind) to their center, then downward into the ground through the uniquely positioned columns.\n\nThe church, at 619 Lexington Avenue with its entrance from 54th Street, has a theatre in its basement which is mainly used by the York Theatre.\n\nDue to a design oversight and changes during construction, the building as initially completed was structurally unsound. For his original design, LeMessurier calculated wind load on the building when wind blew perpendicularly against the side of the building—wind from due north, east, south, or west—all that was required by New York building code. Such winds are normally the worst case, and a structural system capable of handling them can easily cope with wind from any other angle. Thus, the engineer did not specifically calculate the effects of diagonally-oriented \"quartering winds\" (northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest). In June 1978, prompted by discussion between a civil engineering student at Princeton University, Diane Hartley, and design engineer Joel Weinstein, LeMessurier recalculated the wind loads on the building, this time including quartering winds. This recalculation revealed that with a quartering wind, there was a 40% increase in wind loads, resulting in a 160% increase in the load at the chevron brace connection joints.\n\nLeMessurier's original design for the chevron load braces used welded joints. However, during construction, builder Bethlehem Steel was approved to use bolted joints to save labor and material costs. LeMessurier's firm approved the change, although this was not known to LeMessurier himself. The original welded-joint design had ample strength to withstand the load from straight-on wind, with enough safety margin to withstand the higher loads from quartering wind; however, the load from a hurricane force quartering wind would exceed the strength of the bolted-joint chevrons. The bolts could shear and the building could collapse. Wind tunnel tests with models of Citigroup Center revealed that the wind speed required to bring down the building occurred on average once in 55 years.\n\nFor occupant comfort, the building has a tuned mass damper, which also negates much of the wind load. The damper is electrically activated, so if power failed, say during a hurricane, the damper might not turn on and a much lower-speed wind would suffice; wind of this speed occurs on average once in 16 years. LeMessurier also discovered that his firm had used New York City's truss safety factor of 1:1 instead of the column safety factor of 1:2. These factors, combined, put the building in critical danger. The problems were discovered in June, the beginning of hurricane season, and had to be corrected quickly.\n\nLeMessurier reportedly agonized over how to deal with the problem. If the issues were made known to the public, he risked ruining his professional reputation. He approached the architect (Hugh Stubbins) first, and then Citicorp. He advised them to take swift remedial action. Ultimately, he persuaded Citicorp to repair the building without informing the public, a task made easier by a press strike, then going on.\n\nFor the next three months, construction crews working at night welded 2\" steel plates over each of the skyscraper's 200 bolted joints. They worked during the night, after each work day, almost unknown to the general public. Six weeks into the work, a major storm (Hurricane Ella) was off Cape Hatteras and heading for New York. With New York City hours away from emergency evacuation, the reinforcement was only half-finished. Ella eventually turned eastward and veered out to sea, buying enough time for workers to permanently correct the problem. As a precaution, Citicorp did work out emergency evacuation plans with local officials for the immediate neighborhood.\n\nBecause nothing happened as a result of the engineering gaffe, the danger was kept hidden from the public for almost 20 years. It was publicized in a lengthy article in \"The New Yorker\" in 1995.\n\nArchitect Eugene Kremer has discussed the ethical questions raised in this case.\n\nLeMessurier was criticized for insufficient oversight leading to bolted rather than welded joints, for not informing the endangered neighbors, for actively misleading the public about the extent of the danger during the reinforcement process, and for not informing other architects about the problem and solution for two decades. However, his act of alerting Citicorp to the problem in his design is now used as an example of ethical behavior in several engineering textbooks.\n\nKremer discusses six key points:\n\n\nFormer Citicorp Chairman Walter B. Wriston was reportedly behind the decision to acquire several low- and mid-rise buildings in the area, supposedly to buy out massage parlors and mom-and-pop stores in Midtown. In 1987, Citigroup sold two-thirds of its interest in the building, along with one-third of its interest in 399 Park Avenue, to Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company for $670 million (total cost of building adjusted for inflation: $). In 2001, Citicorp sold its controlling stake in the building for $755 million (cost of building adjusted for inflation: $) to Boston Properties. Citigroup relocated its headquarters to 399 Park Avenue.\n\nIn 2008, building owner Boston Properties began the process of renaming the tower \"601 Lexington Avenue\". Renovation of the lobby resulted in relocation of the tower's entrance from 53rd Street to Lexington Avenue. All signage for Citigroup was removed from the building and surrounding block. The name change became effective in 2009. The company is also considering selling naming rights to the building.\n\nIn March 2017, Gensler revealed designs for a major renovation around the base of the tower. The renovation will include a redesigned entry plaza and a new atrium space.\n\n\nThe building is visible in numerous television shows and movies (often as part of a wider panoramic shot of New York City), notably during the opening credits of the long-running NBC police procedural and legal drama \"Law & Order\", and it can also be seen in the background of the opening titles of the 1980s sitcom \"Taxi\".\n\nA season one episode of the TV show \"NUMB3RS\", \"Structural Corruption\", involves a fictional building with faults almost exactly paralleling the crisis of the Citigroup Center. Like the Citigroup Center, a college student studying the fictional Cole Center finds the building to have inadequate strength when subjected to quartering winds. However, the insufficient welds in the Cole Center lie in the foundation, and a tuned mass-damper (not present in the original construction) is added to make the building safe.\n\nThe building's architectural design and history were the feature of episode 110, \"Structural Integrity\", of the podcast \"99% Invisible\".\n\nThe silhouette of the sloped top of the building appears on the label of Chock-full-of-Nuts coffee.\n\nThe sloped top of the building is referenced in the Manhattan Mini Storage logo, as the top of the first letter \"t\" is similarly sloped. In an older version of the logo, the top left corner of the letter M was sloped like the Citigroup Center .\n\nCitibank/Citicorp employees nicknamed the building \"Walter's Whistle\" after Citicorp Chairman Walter B. Wriston.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, the New York Mets have at times used a logo since 2014 that has included the Citigroup Center, as Citigroup is the sponsor of their home stadium, Citi Field.\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

Canada (Attorney General)\" in 2010. In it, a detailed analysis was given in explaining the nature of insolvency law in Canada.\n\nThe \"Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act\" (BIA) provides a more rules-based approach for resolving a corporate debtor's insolvency, which must be observed strictly. The CCAA, on the other hand, provides a more discretionary approach that is remedial in nature, which therefore must be broadly construed.\n\nAlthough the CCAA was originally enacted in 1933, extensive use of it only began in the economic downturn of the early 1980s. Recent legislative amendments of the BIA and CCAA have served to harmonize key aspects, such as the use of single proceedings, a common priority of claims structure, and encouraging reorganization over liquidation.\n\nThis is noted together with s. 11 of the CCAA, which states that a court may, \"subject to the restrictions set out in this Act, . . . make any order that it considers appropriate in the circumstances\".\n\nThe decision notes the interrelated nature of proceedings under the CCAA and BIA:\n\nThe scope of the CCAA is quite broad. It applies to any debtor company (or group of affiliated companies) that owes more than $5 million, other than:\n\nand:\n\nNo person may terminate or amend — or claim an accelerated payment or forfeiture of the term under — any agreement, including a security agreement, with any debtor company subject to the CCAA by reason only that proceedings commenced under the CCAA or that the company is insolvent.\n\nAgreements can be assigned or disclaimed by the debtor company as a result of the proceeding, by following prescribed procedures. These provisions extend beyond being used only within restructuring plans, and the courts have held that there is \"no reason…why the same analysis cannot apply during a sale process that requires the business to be carried as a going concern\", In that regard:\n\nNegotiated compromises and arrangements may deal with any matter, including claims against directors and amendments to the articles of incorporation or letters patent incorporating the company. When they have been approved by each participating class of creditors (by a two-thirds vote by value of the claims involved) the court may then approve it, and it will be binding on all persons, including trustees in bankruptcy.\n\nThey cannot be approved by the court if provision is not made for settling \"super priority\" claims (as they are known under the BIA) relating to:\n\nIn addition, no amounts relating to \"equity claims\" may be authorized by the court under a compromise or arrangement until all other claims are first paid in full. \"Equity claims\" have been held to include any claims shareholders may have against third parties in certain circumstances.\n\nAny interested person may apply to the court for an order under the Act. This is normally the debtor company, but a creditor can also do so. The court having jurisdiction is the superior court for the province in which the company's head office or chief place of business in Canada, or, in the absence of that, where any of its assets are situated.\n\nWhen the application is made, the court is required to appoint a monitor with respect to the business and financial affairs of the company, who must be a trustee in bankruptcy under the \"Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act\". The monitor is required to investigate and report back to the court on the company, advise the court with respect to any actions that need to be taken, and to carry out any other functions in relation to the company that the court may direct.\n\nWhere a compromise or arrangement has already been negotiated with the secured or unsecured creditors essentially creating a pre-packaged insolvency the court may summarily order that it proceed to be voted on by each class of creditors concerned, and, where necessary, by the shareholders as well. Whether a creditor is secured or unsecured is governed by the BIA.\n\nHowever, the court is not bound to accept an application under the Act, and it can terminate previously granted orders (and even declare them to have been void \"ab initio\") where an applicant has not made full and fair disclosure of all material facts. Where a petition for CCAA relief appears to be more like a defensive tactic than a \"bona fide\" attempt to restructure, it may prefer to order receivership instead.\n\nWhere no such compromise or arrangement has been negotiated, the court, on application, may issue an order, lasting for 30 days,\nany proceedings against the debtor company, while negotiations are held to secure a compromise or arrangement with creditors and shareholders. The court may extend the protection for any period it sees fit. A stay may be lifted upon application to the court, but only in very restricted circumstances:\n\nProvision is made for such stays not affecting investigations undertaken by any regulatory body (other than with respect to any payment that may be ordered), but the court can order the cancellation of such exemption where:\n\nHowever, as noted in \"Newfoundland and Labrador v. AbitibiBowater Inc.\", not all payments required under regulatory orders constitute claims under the \"CCAA\" and are thus subject to stay. Subsequent jurisprudence suggests that determining the status of such orders will be case-specific.\n\nIn addition, the court has broad discretion in administering any other issues that may arise. As the Act says,\n\nThis has allowed for very creative applications for resolving difficult scenarios, including:\n\nIn order to assure that the company's operations will continue during the proceedings, the court has power to declare that the assets of the company are subject to a security or charge with respect to certain matters, and may further order that such charges rank ahead of those of secured creditors. They include:\n\nThis \"super priority\" status is construed broadly, and has been held to even defeat statutory deemed trusts (such as those concerning pension plan deficiencies and vacation pay that exist in Ontario), as well as \"in rem\" claims such as maritime liens that are found in maritime law.\n\nThe court may also order:\n\nThe CCAA has been described as being similar in nature to Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States and to administration proceedings and company voluntary arrangements (\"CVAs\") in the United Kingdom. Differences between the various proceedings include the following highlights:\n\n"}

Harkness (1822-1896) was an American merchant and businessman in Ohio. He played a role in the formation of Standard Oil in Ohio. \n\nHis older step-brother Stephen V. Harkness and younger half-brother Henry M. Flagler became two of the original five founding partners of Standard Oil, along with John D. Rockefeller. Daniel Harkness had persuaded Henry Flagler to move to Ohio when young and join him in his uncle's business. There Flagler met Stephen V. Harkness and John D. Rockefeller. Daniel Harkness became a major stockholder in Standard Oil and one of the wealthiest individuals of his day.\n\nDaniel M. Harkness was the son of Dr. David M. Harkness and his second wife, Elizabeth Morrison (Caldwell). His father had been widowed, and had a son Stephen V. Harkness from his first marriage. David died when Daniel was young. Later the widowed Elizabeth Harkness took her two sons and returned to upstate New York. There she married Isaac Flagler, a Presbyterian minister in Hopewell, New York. They had a son, Henry Flagler, Daniel's half brother. \n\nIn 1837, Dan Harkness moved to Bellevue, Ohio from Hopewell, New York to live with his paternal uncle Lamon G. (LG) Harkness. He later moved to Republic, Ohio to work in the Harkness store there. Dan encouraged his younger half-brother, Henry Flagler, to leave Hopewell and join him in Republic, which Henry did in 1844. The two worked for a while in Republic and then moved to Bellevue, Ohio to become more involved in the grain and distillery business. \n\nDan married his Uncle L.G.'s daughter Isabella and Henry married her sister Mary. The two young men both did very well in Bellevue. Henry decided to venture into the salt business in Michigan, but found he did not have sufficient technical knowledge to weather changes in the markets during the Civil War. When Flagler returned from Michigan having lost a substantial salt mine investment, Daniel helped bail him out by lending him money.\n\nFlagler moved to Cleveland in 1866, thinking he would have better opportunity in a larger city, and had an office in the same building as John D. Rockefeller.\n\nHarkness and his family remained primarily in Bellevue, taking over the home that Henry Flagler had built there, known as \"The Gingerbread House\". \n\nHarkness married Isabella, and they had children together. She died in 1864. Later he donated the funds to build Harkness Memorial First Congregational Church next door to his home in her honor; it was completed in 1887. He stipulated that the church must not have a bell because he did not want to be disturbed by one. The church is still standing in Bellevue to this day. \n\nHarkness was appointed as a trustee of Standard Oil. When he died in 1896 his estate, estimated to be $35 million and mostly in Standard Oil stock, was left to his only surviving child, William L. Harkness. This $35 million would equate to approximately $1 billion in 2013.\n"}
{"id": "1190346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1190346", "title": "Deferral", "text": "Deferral\n\nA deferral, in \"accrual accounting\", is any account where the asset or liability is not realized until a future date (accounting period), e.g. annuities, charges, taxes, income, etc. The deferred item may be carried, dependent on type of deferral, as either an asset or liability. See also accrual.\n\nDeferrals are the consequence of the revenue recognition principle which dictates that revenues be recognized in the period in which they occur, and the matching principle which dictates expenses to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. Deferrals are the result of cash flows occurring before they are allowed to be recognized under accrual accounting. As a result, adjusting entries are required to reconcile a flow of cash (or rarely other non-cash items) with events that have not occurred yet as either liabilities or assets. Because of the similarity between deferrals and their corresponding accruals, they are commonly conflated.\n\n\nDeferred charge (or deferral) is cost that is accounted-for in latter accounting period for its anticipated future benefit, or to comply with the requirement of matching costs with revenues. \"Deferred charges\" include costs of starting up, obtaining long-term debt, advertising campaigns, etc., and are carried as a non-current asset on the balance sheet pending amortization. \n\"Deferred charges\" often extend over five years or more and occur infrequently unlike prepaid expenses, e.g. insurance, interest, rent. Financial ratios are based on the total assets excluding \"deferred charges\" since they have no physical substance (cash realization) and cannot be used in reducing total liabilities.\n\nA Deferred expense or prepayment, prepaid expense, plural often prepaids, is an asset representing cash paid out to a counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later accounting period. For example, if a service contract is paid quarterly in advance, at the end of the first month of the period two months remain as a deferred expense. In the deferred expense the early payment is accompanied by a related recognized expense in the subsequent accounting period, and the same amount is deducted from the prepayment. The deferred expense shares characteristics with accrued revenue (or \"accrued assets\") with the difference that an asset to be covered later are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such income item is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from \"accrued revenues\".\n\nFor example, when the accounting periods are monthly, an 11/12 portion of an annually paid insurance cost is added to \"prepaid expenses\", which are decreased by 1/12 of the cost in each subsequent period when the same fraction is recognized as an expense, rather than all in the month in which such cost is billed. The not-yet-recognized portion of such costs remains as \"prepayments\" (assets) to prevent such cost from turning into a fictitious loss in the monthly period it is billed, and into a fictitious profit in any other monthly period.\n\nSimilarly, cash paid out for (the cost of) goods and services not received by the end of the accounting period is added to the \"prepayments\" to prevent it from turning into a fictitious loss in the period cash was paid out, and into a fictitious profit in the period of their reception. Such cost is not recognized in the income statement (\"profit and loss\" or P&L) as the expense incurred in the period of payment, but in the period of their reception when such costs are recognized as expenses in P&L and deducted from prepayments (assets) on balance sheets.\n\nDeferred revenue (or deferred income) is a liability, such as cash received from a counterpart for goods or services that are to be delivered in a later accounting period. When such income item is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the \"deferred revenue\" is reduced. It shares characteristics with \"accrued expense\" with the difference that a liability to be covered later is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later period when its amount is deducted from \"accrued expenses\".\n\nFor example, a company receives an annual software license fee paid out by a customer upfront on the January 1. However, the company's fiscal year ends on May 31. So, the company using accrual accounting adds only five months' worth (5/12) of the fee to its revenues in profit and loss for the fiscal year the fee was received. The rest is added to \"deferred income\" (liability) on the balance sheet for that year.\n\n"}

He restricted his racing to England, France, Italy and Belgium, with motor racing in the Netherlands virtually non-existent, and Jews not allowed to participate in motor racing in Nazi Germany.\n\nAt Monthléry, Hertzberger managed to break some speed records in his K3. He also started in the Mille Miglia and at Le Mans. He quit racing in 1938 after getting married, although he made a surprise appearance at Zandvoort in 1953.\n\nHertzberger was the first of only two Dutch racing drivers to win races titled 'Grand Prix', the other being Carel Godin de Beaufort, until Max Verstappen won the 2016 Spanish Formula One Grand Prix\n\nHertzberger owned a successful clothing factory in Rotterdam. The factory, including his Bugatti Stelvio #57519 which was parked inside, was completely destroyed at the outbreak of World War II during the bombardment of Rotterdam that prompted the surrender of Holland to the Nazis. Hertzberger escaped the Netherlands through Belgium and France to Switzerland, where he stayed for more than a year. Later he travelled through Vichy France to reach Spain. In Madrid Hertzberger became a member of the intelligence service of the Dutch government, which was based in London during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, Hertzberger rebuilt his factory and lived both in the Netherlands and New York City. Later he moved to Switzerland, where he died in 1993.\n\nHis wife, Eleonore Hertzberger-Katz (born 1917), wrote a book about their hazardous journeys, which was reprinted in Dutch in June 2003.\n\nEddie Hertzberger's granddaughter Gwendolyn also races. She currently competes in Formula Renault.\n\n\n"}

Her mother’s bloodline was related to the Moli tribe and Emma was recognized by the Malietoa as a princess. In 1869, she married James Forsayth, a Scottish seaman and they set up a shipping and trading business in American Samoa. Emma was involved in island politics with her father and lost favor with the local people after he was deported in 1876. Around this time, her husband was said to be lost at sea, however there was no confirmation that her husband was dead.\n\nIn 1878, she left American Samoa with an Australian lover, James Farrell, who was known as a blackbirder, captain and trader for the Duke of York Islands in between New Britain and New Ireland. There they traded mainly copra with the local population for beads, tobacco, knives and mirrors. The area was largely unsettled by Europeans up until that point due to resistance from the local inhabitants.\n\nEmma and Farrell were to assist people that were involved in the Marquis De Rays incident where over 500 people were swindled out of their life’s savings to form a new colony at the South Eastern tip of New Ireland. Four ships sailed from France between Jan 1880 – Aug 1881, the \"Chandernagore\", \"Genil\", \"India\" and \"Neu Bretagne\". This practically marooned the colonists whilst the founder reported the progress of the colony in an extremely positive light in his newspaper \"La Nouvelle France\" in Paris. Emma and Farrell assisted the marooned colonists back to Australia. De Rays was later tried and found guilty of fraud in France.\n\nIn 1881, Emma became interested in land around the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain and differed with Farrell who continued trading. Emma bought the land from the local chiefs and with the assistance of her brother-in-law, the Dane, Richard Parkinson, set up a large coconut and cocoa plantations around Kokopo, East New Britain. During this period, she became highly successful and well respected. She was known as a heady woman, known to affect her charm on others and for throwing outlandish extravagant parties aided by her nieces. She was the envy of the German colonists who started to move into Kokopo around 1890 and passing trades ships. It was during this period she became affectionately known as the “Queen of New Guinea”. Commercially from 1880–1900 years, her enterprises in Kokopo surpassed most in the region and the Pacific and she was most certainly the commerce queen of New Guinea.\n\nIn 1893 Emma married Paul Kolbe, a German colonial official and former army captain who was nearly fifteen years her junior. Her commercial empire was still in full swing when towards the end of 1907 she learnt of increasing tensions between Germany and Britain in the colonies and Europe. Emma sold off most of her assets in c. 1910 to Heinrich Rudolph Walen of Hamburgische Südsee AG. She later lived in Sydney and died in 1913 in Monte Carlo by the bedside of her estranged husband Paul Kolbe. Their ashes were buried in her old station cemetery “Gunantambu” at Ralum, which is today the site of the Ralum Club in Kokopo, New Britain, Papua New Guinea. Emma's son from her first marriage, James \"Coe\" Forsayth, reinterred the urns in Sydney at the South Head Cemetery in 1924.\n\nForsayth is portrayed by Barbara Carrera in the 1988 television serial \"\", which was directed by John Banas for Australia's Network 10. She is featured in Christian Kracht's 2012 novel \"Imperium\", which focuses on August Engelhardt.\n"}

She was a sister of President John F. Kennedy and senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy. Her husband, Sargent Shriver, was the United States Ambassador to France during the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency.\n\nIn 1962, Shriver founded Camp Shriver, which started on her Maryland farm known as Timberlawn, and evolved into Special Olympics in 1968.\n\nEunice Mary Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts. She was the fifth of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., and Rose Fitzgerald.\n\nShriver was educated at the Convent of The Sacred Heart, Roehampton, London and at Manhattanville College in Upper Manhattan (the school later moved farther north to Purchase, New York). After graduating from Stanford University with a bachelor of science degree in sociology in 1943, she worked for the Special War Problems Division of the U.S. State Department. She eventually moved to the U.S. Justice Department as executive secretary for a project dealing with juvenile delinquency. She served as a social worker at the Federal Industrial Institution for Women for one year before moving to Chicago in 1951 to work with the House of the Good Shepherd women's shelter and the Chicago Juvenile Court.\n\nIn 1969, Shriver moved to France and pursued her interest in intellectual disability there. She started organizing small activities with Paris organizations, mostly reaching out to families of kids who had special needs to provide activities for them, laying the foundation for a robust international expansion of the Special Olympics in the late '70s and '80s.\n\nShriver actively campaigned for her elder brother, John, during his successful 1960 U.S. presidential election. In 1968, she helped Anne McGlone Burke nationalize the Special Olympics movement and is the only woman to have her portrait appear, during her lifetime, on a U.S. coin – the 1995 commemorative Special Olympics silver dollar.\n\nAlthough Shriver was a Democrat, she was a vocal supporter of the pro-life movement. In 1990, Shriver wrote a letter to \"The New York Times\" denouncing the misuse of a quotation by President Kennedy used out of context by a pro-choice group. During Bill Clinton's 1992 Democratic U.S. presidential campaign, she was one of several prominent Democrats – including Governor Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, and Bishop Austin Vaughan of New York – who signed a letter to \"The New York Times\" protesting the Democratic Party's pro-choice plank in its platform. Shriver was a supporter of several pro-life organizations: Feminists for Life of America, the Susan B. Anthony List, and Democrats for Life of America.\n\nA lifelong Democrat, Shriver supported her Republican son-in-law Arnold Schwarzenegger's successful 2003 Governor of California election. On January 28, 2008, Shriver was present at American University in Washington, D.C., when her brother, U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, announced his endorsement of Barack Obama's 2008 Democratic U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nA longtime advocate for children's health and disability issues, Shriver was a key founder of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), a part of the National Institutes of Health in 1962. She has also helped to establish numerous other university programs, government initiatives, health-care facilities, and support service networks throughout the country. In 1961, she championed the creation of the President's Panel on Mental Retardation which was significant in the movement from institutionalization to community integration in the US and throughout the world, a major public policy challenge. In 1982, Shriver founded the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Center for Community of Caring at University of Utah, Salt Lake City. The Community is a \"grades K-12, whole school, comprehensive character education program with a focus on disabilities... adopted by almost 1,200 schools nationwide and in Canada.\"\n\nShe was awarded the nation's highest civilian award, the (U.S.) Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1984 by U.S. President Ronald Reagan, because of her work on behalf of those with intellectual disability. In 1990 Shriver was awarded the Eagle Award from the United States Sports Academy. The Eagle Award is the Academy's highest international honor and was awarded to Shriver for her significant contributions to international sport.\n\nIn 1992, Shriver received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.\n\nFor her work in nationalizing the Special Olympics, Shriver received the Civitan International World Citizenship Award. Her advocacy on this issue has also earned her other awards and recognitions, including honorary degrees from numerous universities. She is the second American and only woman to appear on a US coin while still living. Her portrait is on the obverse of the 1995 commemorative silver dollar honoring the Special Olympics. On the reverse is the quotation, \"As we hope for the best in them, hope is reborn in us.\"\n\nIn 1998, Shriver was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nShriver received the 2002 Theodore Roosevelt Award (the Teddy), an annual award given by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to a graduate from an NCAA member institution who earned a varsity letter in college for participation in intercollegiate athletics, and who ultimately became a distinguished citizen of national reputation based on outstanding life accomplishment. In addition to the Teddy recognition, she was selected in 2006 as part of the NCAA Centennial celebration as one of the 100 most-influential individuals in its first century; she was listed ninth.\n\nIn 2006, she received a papal knighthood from Pope Benedict XVI, being made a Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (DSG). Her mother had been created a papal countess in 1950 by Pope Pius XII.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Congress changed the NICHD's name to the \"Eunice Kennedy Shriver\" National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. In December 2008, \"Sports Illustrated\" named Shriver the first recipient of Sportsman of the Year Legacy Award. On May 9, 2009, the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in Washington, D.C., unveiled an historic portrait of her, the first portrait the NPG has ever commissioned of an individual who had not served as a U.S. President or First Lady. The portrait depicts her with four Special Olympics athletes (including Loretta Claiborne) and one Best Buddies participant. It was painted by David Lenz, the winner of the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition in 2006. As part of the Portrait Competition prize, the NPG commissioned a work from the winning artist to depict a living subject for the collection. Lenz, whose son, Sam, has Down syndrome and is an enthusiastic Special Olympics athlete, was inspired by Shriver's dedication to working with people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nShriver became involved with Dorothy Hamill's special skating program in the Special Olympics after Hamill's Olympic Games ice-skating win. In September 2010, the State University of New York at Brockport, home of the 1979 Special Olympics, renamed its football stadium after Shriver.\n\nIn July 2017, Shriver posthumously received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2017 ESPY Awards.\n\nOn May 23, 1953, Shriver married Sargent Shriver in a Roman Catholic ceremony at Saint Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. Her husband served as the U.S. Ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970 and was the 1972 Democratic U.S. Vice Presidential candidate (with George McGovern as the candidate for U.S. President). They had five children:\n\nWith her husband, Shriver had nineteen grandchildren, the second-most of any of her siblings (her brother Robert had eleven children who have produced thirty-four grandchildren). Her daughter Maria Shriver is divorced from actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nAs executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation in the 1950s, Shriver shifted the organization's focus from Catholic charities to research on the causes of intellectual disabilities and humane ways to treat them. This interest eventually culminated in, among other things, the Special Olympics movement.\n\nUpon the death of her sister Rosemary Kennedy on January 7, 2005, Shriver became the eldest of the four then-surviving children of Joseph and Rose Kennedy. Her sister Patricia Kennedy died on September 17, 2006, and her brother Edward M. Kennedy died on August 25, 2009, leaving former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith as the only surviving sibling.\n\nShriver, who was believed to have suffered from Addison's disease, suffered a stroke and broken hip in 2005. On November 18, 2007, she was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she spent several weeks. On August 7, 2009, she was admitted to Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, with an undisclosed ailment. On August 10, her relatives were called to the hospital. Early the next morning, Shriver died at the hospital; she was 88 years old.\n\nShriver's family issued a statement upon her death, reading in part:\n\nPresident Barack Obama remarked after Shriver's death that she was \"an extraordinary woman who, as much as anyone, taught our nation—and our world—that no physical or mental barrier can restrain the power of the human spirit.\"\n\nOn August 14, 2009, an invitation-only Requiem Mass was celebrated for Shriver at St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church in Hyannis. Following the Requiem Mass, she was buried at the St. Francis Xavier parish cemetery in nearby Centerville. Pope Benedict XVI sent a letter of condolence to her family. Because her brother Ted had terminal brain cancer, he was unable to attend the funeral, and their sister Jean Smith stayed with him. Ted died two weeks later, leaving Jean as the sole surviving child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy.\n\n\n"}

It is the oldest of three Manhattan graveyards currently maintained by Congregation Shearith Israel (Hebrew, \"Remnant of Israel\"), which is itself the oldest Jewish congregation in North America. (The Congregation was formed by Spanish and Portuguese Sephardic Jewish immigrants in 1654.) Today, the cemetery is a mere fragment of its original extent. Only about a hundred headstones and above ground tombs can still be seen in what remains of the old burial ground, which rises slightly above street level. It is the only remaining 17th century structure in Manhattan.\n\n What is now called the \"First Shearith Israel Graveyard,\" near Chatham Square in Lower Manhattan, was in use from 1683 to 1833. An older cemetery called \"Beth Haim,\" dated to 1656 — two years after the community arrived, was located around the corner of Madison and Oliver Streets. The site for First Shearith Israel Graveyard was originally on a hill overlooking the East River in an open area at the northern periphery of the British-Dutch colonial settlement. The plot was purchased in 1682 by Joseph Bueno de Mesquita, and its first interment was for his relative, Benjamin Bueno de Mesquita, the following year. The cemetery expanded in the 1700s so that at one point it extended from Chatham Square over what is now the upper part of Oliver Street down to Bancker (now Madison) Street.\n\nIn a letter in 1776, a staff officer of General George Washington recommended emplacing an artillery battery \"at the foot of the Jews' burying ground\" to help secure Long Island Sound. American prisoners of war were buried en masse in entrenchments beyond the graveyard. In 1823, a city ordinance prohibited burials south of Canal Street, compelling the congregation to rely on its second burial ground, consecrated in 1805 at West 11th Street in Greenwich Village. (Notwithstanding this, a few more burials took place at Chatham Square up to 1833.) Much of this burden was alleviated in 1829, when Shearith Israel's third cemetery was consecrated at 21st Street just west of 6th Avenue.\n\nEncroaching development and erosion necessitated several instances over the years in which the congregation was forced reduce the size of the Chatham Square Cemetery and disinter bodies, which were moved to their three other graveyards. In 1851, city public health officials prohibited burial south of 86th Street and in partnership with other synagogues, the congregation purchased a large plot of land in Ridgewood, Queens as a fourth cemetery. The most notable of these instances was in 1855, when a large portion of the cemetery was seized by eminent domain. This accommodated expansion of the Bowery — including the cut-through of today's St. James Place — and some 256 graves were removed.\n\nToday, access to the cemetery is by appointment only.\n\nFrom 1656 until 1825, all of the practicing Jews of New York City belonged to the Shearith Israel congregation and were buried here, including 22 who fought in the Revolutionary War.

{"id": "7946522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7946522", "title": "Gas dynamic cold spray", "text": "Gas dynamic cold spray\n\nCold Spray (CS) (formerly gas dynamic cold spray) is a coating deposition method. Solid powders (1 to 50 micrometers in diameter) are accelerated in a supersonic gas jet to velocities up to 500–1000 m/s. During impact with the substrate, particles undergo plastic deformation and adhere to the surface. To achieve a uniform thickness the spraying nozzle is scanned along the substrate. Metals, polymers, ceramics, composite materials and nanocrystalline powders can be deposited using cold spraying. The kinetic energy of the particles, supplied by the expansion of the gas, is converted to plastic deformation energy during bonding. Unlike thermal spraying techniques, e.g., plasma spraying, arc spraying, flame spraying, or high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF), the powders are not melted during the spraying process.\n\nThere are two types of CS. High pressure cold spray (HPCS) in which the working gas is nitrogen or helium at pressures above 1.5 MPa, a flow rate of more than 2 m/min, heating power of 18 kW. It is used for spraying pure metal powders with the sizes of 5–50 µm. In low pressure cold spray (LPCS), the working gas is a compressed gas with pressure 0.5–1.0 MPa, flow rate 0.5–2 m/min and the heating power 3–5 kW. It is used for spraying a mechanical mixture of metal and ceramic powders. The inclusion of a ceramic component in the mixture provides high-quality coatings with relatively low energy consumption.\n\nThe most prevailing bonding theory in cold spraying is attributed to \"adiabatic shear instability\" which occurs at the particle substrate interface at or beyond a certain velocity called critical velocity. When a spherical particle travelling at critical velocity impacts a substrate, a strong pressure field propagates spherically into the particle and substrate from the point of contact. As a result of this pressure field, a shear load is generated which accelerates the material laterally and causes localized shear straining. The shear loading under critical conditions leads to adiabatic shear instability where thermal softening is locally dominant over work strain and strain rate hardening, which leads to a discontinuous jump in strain and temperature and breakdown of flow stresses. This adiabatic shear instability phenomena results in viscous flow of material at an outward flowing direction with temperatures close to melting temperature of the material. This material jetting is also a known phenomenon in explosive welding of materials.\n\nThere are several factors that can affect the quality of cold-sprayed coatings and the deposition efficiency. Main influential factors are: \nCold spray parameters are selected with respect to the desired coating characteristics and economic considerations. This can be done by considering correlations between process parameters and final coating properties. There are also software packages available for this purpose.\n\nCS has many advantages that make the technology potentially very competitive. Being a cold process, the initial physical and chemical particle properties are retained and the heating of the substrate is minimal, resulting in cold-worked microstructure of coatings where no melting and solidification happen. Dynamic recrystallization with refined grains has been observed between particle and particle bonding region. Furthermore, the technology allows to spray thermally sensitive materials and highly dissimilar materials combinations, due to the fact that the adhesion mechanism is purely mechanical.\n\nOther advantages are:\nThe jet obtained is a high-density particle beam due to the small size of the nozzle (10–15 mm) and the short stand-off distance (25 mm). This results in high focus of the jet and precise control over the deposition area. Finally, inducing compressive stresses allows to obtain dense uniform and ultra-thick (20 μm – 50 mm) coatings.\n\nOn the other side, some difficulties can be found. For instance, it is difficult to spray hard and brittle materials because, in this case, mechanical adhesion through plastic deformation could be not as effective as it is for ductile particles. Other problems could include:\n\nThe ability for CS to deposit materials that are phase-sensitive or temperature-sensitive has positioned the technique to prepare coatings not possible with other thermal spray techniques. CS can generally be used to produce coatings of a wide variety of metals, alloys, and metal-based composites, including those materials that have an exceptionally high melting temperatures (e.g. tantalum, niobium, superalloys). The process is also valuable for depositing materials that are extremely sensitive to the presence of oxygen and will readily oxidize at modest elevated temperatures – a result which is deleterious to the performance of these materials. Some examples of oxygen sensitive coatings that are commonly produced with CS are aluminum, copper, titanium, and carbide composites (e.g. tungsten carbide), as well as coatings made from amorphous alloys.\n\nAdditional developments in CS are related to the deposition of ceramic materials on metals, notably titanium dioxide for photocatalytic effects, and the use of CS in additive manufacturing.\n\nCold spray is now used to repair machine parts in a matter of minutes. Metal (nickel alloys) particles travel in a blend of nitrogen and helium gas and gradually stack up on the damaged part to recreate the desired surface. A robot controls the movement of the sprayer. The U.S. Army uses the technology to repair a component in Blackhawk helicopters. General Electric is adapting the technology for civilian applications.\n\nAdditive manufacturing using cold spray technology can be used to develop parts and components rapidly with deposition rates as high as 45kg/hour - much faster than other additive manufacturing methods.\n\nUnlike other additive manufacturing methods such as selective laser melting or electron beam additive manufacturing, cold spray technology does not melt metals. This means that metals are not affected by heat-related distortion, and parts do not need to be manufactured in an inert gas or vacuum sealed environment, allowing the creation of much larger structures. The world's largest and fastest metal 3D printer has a build envelope of 9 x 3 x 1.5m and utilizes gas dynamic cold spray. Manufacturing with cold spray technology provides advantages such as the ability to create shapes with no shape or size constraints, more efficient buy-to-fly ratio when compared to machining, and capable of fusing dissimilar metals to create hybrid metal parts - materials such as titanium alloys, copper, zinc, stainless steel, aluminium, nickel, even hastelloy and inconel can be sprayed together.\n"}

Climate change is having significant impacts on this ecosystem; between 2004 and 2013, the Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than 99.9% of the global oceans, increasing average temperature by . Having seen the depletion of groundfish stocks starting in the early 1990s, managers took care to create five closure areas in the Gulf of Maine.\n\nThese closed areas do not prohibit all fishing, rather they prevent the further degradation of benthic habitat and groundfish species. Closed areas are different than Marine Protected Areas (MPA) because they allow some forms of fishing and other activities to occur that would normally not be allowed in MPA.\n\nThe Western Gulf of Maine Closure Area (WGoMAC) was established in 1998 in response to the decreasing Atlantic Cod (\"Gadus morhua\") stock. WGoMAC is located off the shores of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine and is approximately . It is rectangular and runs in straight lines from 42° 15' to 43° 15' North, and 69° 55' to 70° 15' West.\n\nIt is a year long closed area that prevents groundfish fishing. Fishing vessels that are using exempted gear (pelagic trawls and nets) are allowed. Charter and recreational vessels are allowed and may fish with a Letter of Authorization (LOA) from a Regional Administrator.\n\nCashes Ledge Closure Area (CL) was permanently closed in 1998, in response to overfished groundfish resources. The area boundaries of the five sided polygon that is CL run from 42° 42.5' to 43° 0.7' North, and 68° 46' to 69° 26' West.\n\nCashes Ledge is a shallow habitat () known for being rocky bottom habitat, located off the Northeastern US shore. It is a year long closed area that prevents groundfish fishing. Fishing vessels that are using exempted gear (pelagic trawls and nets) are allowed. Charter and recreational vessels are allowed and may fish with a Letter of Authorization (LOA) from a Regional Administrator.\n\nThis area serves as habitat for fish such as cod and pollock, and cod found in these areas have a higher mean age and gut fullness.

{"id": "18935683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18935683", "title": "Intellectual property education", "text": "Intellectual property education\n\nIntellectual property (IP) consists of four kinds: patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret. In order to understand these areas and use them correctly, a person needs to be trained and educated. That training may be delivered through various types of resources, including webinars, college courses, webpages, and books. Intellectual property education should teach the individual what these areas are, what aspects of the law apply to them, and how to understand normal situations which might arise regarding those specific area. Because of its importance, intellectual property education should be available to people of all age groups and education levels. Because intellectual property laws are specific to each country, training on the topic is also specific to each country.\n\nCopyright protects original expression of ideas in different forms, but not the ideas themselves. The goal of copyright law is to encourage individual and business entities to produce original work by rewarding them with exclusive rights for their benefits, which is subject to time and statutory exceptions.\n\nAs outlined in the United States Copyright Office's guide, Circular 1: Copyright Basics, a work is given copyright protection once it is fixed within a tangible medium, which includes \"written works, musical works, dramatic works, pantomimes and choreographic works, pictorial works, graphic works, sculptural works, motion pictures and other audiovisual works, sound recordings, and architectural works.\" The copyright protection given to the work provides the owner of the work with specific rights including the right to reproduce the work, the right to create a derivative work, the right to perform the work, the right to display the work, and the right to distribute copies of the work. \n\nUnited States copyrights law is based in U.S. Constitution, which authorizes Congress to provide authors with certain exclusive rights in their writings for a limited period of time. The \"writings\" is a broad term, which means any work of original expression in any form or medium, including literary, artistic, musical and etc.. \"Authors\" is also a broad term, which includes all creators of works.\n\nCopyright law is primarily governed by federal statute and the current controlling statute is Copyright Act of 1976, as amended. Under the Supremacy Clause of Constitution, with few exceptions, the Copyright Act of 1976 preempts state law.\n\nThe US Copyright Office administers copyrights authorized by the Copyright Act, whose functions include rulemaking, regulate copyright registration, administering statutory and compulsory licenses. It also provides legal and regulatory background information as well as procedural guidance on its website.\n\nThe federal TEACH Act (Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act of 2002) was signed in November 2002, and governs the use of copyrighted materials in online learning environments. The TEACH Act eases some of the rules put in place by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. Many universities, including the University of Washington, provide information about compliance with the TEACH Act, often related to the use of learning management systems\n\nThough the Copyright Act preempts state law, state law covers the issues which is outside the scope of Copyright Act, such as works of authorship that have not been expressed in a tangible medium(outside of scope of \"fixed in any tangible medium of expression\"), right not equivalent to any of the \"exclusive rights\", etc..\n\nInternational copyright treaties between U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions is enforceable in U.S. territory under the Supremacy Clause, including: The Berne Convention, The Universal Copyright Convention, The WIPO Copyright Treaty, The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, The Geneva Phonograms Convention and TRIPS. While their specific terms are different, two fundamental rules govern each member under each treaty: member countries must meet certain minimum standards for copyright protection in their local law and provide reciprocal treatment to copyright owners in other member jurisdictions. The copyright law provided by each jurisdiction is based on its own national laws.\n\nFair use is one important topic in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. Fair use law allows for limited use of copyrighted materials without seeking and/or acquiring copyright clearance from the copyright owner. There are four factors of fair use: (1) the purpose and character of the use, (2) the nature of the copyrighted work, (3) the amount or portion used of the work, and (4) the effect of the use. Faculty, staff, and students may find a Fair Use Checklist helpful when determining whether or not their use of a material would fall under fair use. Columbia University Libraries' Copyright Advisory Services provides their own Fair Use Checklist and information about fair use law, as well as other information regarding copyright. \n\nFor further clarification on Fair Use and how to determine if a person's use falls under that exception, Stanford University has a Charts and Tools section on their website. This website includes links to codes of best practices - including the Center for Media & Social Impact's Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy Education, a Digital Image Rights Computator to help a user discover if an image they wish to use is copyrighted, and a Copyright Navigator that provides basic information on how copyright law works. Each of the links on the website equips a user with enough resources to determine if their use of a copyrighted material falls under the protection of Fair Use.\n\nThe legislative intent for fair use in Section 107 in Copyright Act is stated as following: \"the bill endorses the purpose and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use, but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute, especially during a period of rapid technological change. Beyond a very broad statutory explanation of what fair use is and some of the criteria applicable to it, the courts must be free to adapt the doctrine to particular situations on a case-by-case basis. Section 107 is intended to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use, not to change, narrow, or enlarge it in any way.\" It means courts have broad discretion to decide fair use application. U.S. Copyright Office creates a Fair Use Index which summarizes the newest case law development in fair use. \n\nPublic Domain is another important concept in Copyright and Intellectual Property Education. If a work is in public domain - i.e., if its copyright has expired, been lost, or was never given - that work may be used by anyone. In order to help determine if a work is in Public Domain, Cornell University provides a Public Domain Flow Chart to help users identify if a work is protected by copyright law. Stanford University Libraries' guide, Welcome to the Public Domain, also provides in-depth information that can help users identify how a work enters the public domain based on the date it was published. For example, within the United States, all works that were created prior to 1923 are currently within the public domain. In order to further understand copyright and public domain, the Copy This Podcast provides listeners with a brief history of Copyright Law and Public Domain. Each podcast is approximately twelve minutes long and covers topics such as \"Pop Culture and the Public Domain,\" \"Fair Use: You Use It More Than You Realize,\" and \"Notice and Takedown: Leave it Be.\" Each of these podcasts features experts and scholars of copyright law and can provide users with information about how to navigate the world of copyright. \n\nOrphan works, or works where the creator or rightsholder is unable to be determined, are an important current topic in copyright law. There is currently no legislation in the United States place to fully address this issue, though progress has been made specifically for music with the Music Modernization Act in 2018. \n\nAfter the Copyright Act of 1976, copyright holders were no longer required to register copyrighted works, which benefited copyright holders by simplifying the process to obtain and maintain copyright protection, but in turn complicated the process for potential users of copyrighted material to determine ownership over certain works as the central register for copyrighted materials was no longer deemed necessary. This made any usage of copyrighted materials outside of fair use a violation of copyright, but did not take into account the drastic changes of access and dissemination that would soon occur due to digitization and the internet. \n\nIn 2006 the U.S. Copyright Office held a study and released a report on orphan works. The main conclusion was that new legislation was needed to address this issue, and that clearly delineated steps need to be identified for potential users of such works, as well as protocols set in place for when an author comes forward. \n\nAnother report, ‘Orphan Works and Mass Digitization’ was completed in 2012 with particular focus on how how efforts to preserve copyrighted material needed to be balanced with reasonable access to the work. This report laid out the prospective changes needed to alter the outdated legislation and better serve current informational needs. \n\nIt is also important to note that in 2013, the UK passed a copyright act that permitted usage of orphan works as long as a diligent effort was made and certain conditions were met, such as filing a ‘notice of use’ for the work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Michaels served as the longtime editor of \"Forbes\" magazine from 1961 until his retirement in 1999.\n\nJames Michaels was born in Buffalo, New York, on June 17, 1921. He attended the Culver Military Academy in Indiana and graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1942. Michaels joined the U.S. military during World War II. He applied to the American Field Service in April 1943 and was sent to Bombay India to drive an ambulance for the British Army as part of AFS India Burma Unit 1. James was the nephew of the comedy writer Al Boasberg.\n\nJames Michaels stayed with the military until September 1944 when he was released to the Office of War Information. After the war, Mr. Michaels remained in India and worked for the United Press wire service's New Delhi office, giving Mr. Michaels the biggest story of his life; in 1948 he broke the story of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Mr. Michaels spent over four decades with \"Forbes\" magazine, after joining as a reporter in 1954 and rising to managing editor in 1957 where he served until 1961 when he became editor.\n\nMr. Michaels retired from \"Forbes\" magazine in 1999 and was succeeded as editor by William Baldwin. He left the magazine to help expand the Forbes Inc parent company into new mediums including television, books and new media. During his time as with Forbes, the magazine's circulation grew from 130,000 to 785,000, demonstrating how much readers enjoyed the magazine.\n\nAccording to Allan Sloan of \"Fortune\" magazine, James Michaels, \"was an absolutely brilliant editor who transformed business magazine journalism.\" Steve Forbes described James Michaels as a tough editor who wanted articles short, dramatic, and opinionated. According to the New York Times, when Michaels took over as editor, \"American journalism remained a polite, dry affair, and corporate spin was reported without much skepticism. Ahead of his time, he made Forbes opinionated, interpretive and often indecorous, a magazine staunchly pro-business (and, its critics said, pro-wealthy) but did not hesitate to skewer companies and executives it saw as failures.\" According to Forbes, \"he despised 'bad actors' who were cheating investors, customers, employees.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times many of his former writers and editors remember Mr. Michaels as much for his brutal assessments of their work as for his incisive teaching. While always a gentlemen and available to talk, he could not stand verbose writing and would ruthlessly cut words and forced writers to state their view. A staunch contrarian, he did not let public opinion dictate the magazines views.\n\nMichaels focused on the needs of his readers, rather than pleasing corporate executives or the mainstream media. Allan Sloan wrote, \"Unlike many of his competitors, Michaels didn't particularly lionize corporate chieftains. His focus was on representing small investors' interests.\" Mr. Michaels wrote, \"MY THESIS is this: If newspapers hope to survive they would do well to be less concerned with a liberal social agenda and more with the lives, hopes, and fears of their potential readers.\"\n\nMichaels was a hater of weasel words. William Baldwin (current Forbes editor) wrote \"Jim had a novel idea. Why not speak to the reader as if you were speaking to a friend on a street corner? Brevity helps. Judgments help. If the chairman of the company is a nincompoop, say so -- if there's evidence to prove it.\"\n\nAs editor, Michaels edited 1,000 issues and he worked on almost every story. He wanted articles to be shorter, more direct, and with a clear conclusion to ensure they were fit for readers. He also wanted stories in Forbes to be original. If a story had been covered in another publication, he didn't want it in the magazine. To quote him, \"Our readers look to us for groundbreaking, helpful stuff. Who needs us if we're doing what everyone else is doing?\"\n\nMr. Michaels' writing on Gandhi's death is included in the anthology \"A Treasury of Great Reporting\". Michaels' dispatches from India are still taught in journalism anthologies of model reporting on deadline.\n\nSteve Forbes credits Mr. Michaels with Forbes success. Mr. Forbes wrote, \"When Jim joined FORBES in 1954, this magazine was, to put it charitably, second-tier. Moreover, business journalism itself was a backwater, a place where publications dumped their drunks and burned-out sportswriters. Today business, finance and economics are front-page stuff.\" \"Jim made FORBES not only the most influential magazine in the business field but also one of the world's premier publications. Indeed, with no exaggeration, Jim Michaels was the foremost editor of our era. He virtually created modern business journalism.\"\n\nIn the 1950s Mr. Michaels foresaw the growth of the then nascent mutual fund industry. Michaels was integral in the development of Forbes' grading system of the long-term performance of funds. \nHe helped create the Forbes 400 ranking of America's richest people, first published in 1982.\n\nMr. Michaels has been cited as mentoring and influencing a long and influential group of writers, journalists, and editors including (but not necessarily limited to): Norman Pearlstine, Allan Sloan, Richard Behar, David Churbuck, Gretchen Morgenson, Kenneth Fisher, Peter Brimelow, William M Reddig Jr and Ed Finn.\n\nMichaels was honored with many awards, including the Loeb Award (1972), Editor of the Year by Ad Week (1983), and Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award (1994). The TJFR Group honored Michaels by naming him one of the Top Ten Business News Luminaries of the Century.\n\nJames Michaels died at age 86 of pneumonia on October 2, 2007 in Manhattan. Michaels was a resident of Manhattan and Rhinebeck, New York, at the time of his death. Michaels was survived by his wife, Jean Briggs, whom he married June 29, 1985. Jean Briggs spent time as a senior editor and manager of the reporter/resesarcher department at Forbes. He was also survived by his brother (Albert), sister (Harriet), three children from a previous marriage, and six granddaughters.\n"}

{"id": "1272663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1272663", "title": "Knock-down kit", "text": "Knock-down kit\n\nA knock-down kit is a kit containing the parts needed to assemble a product. The parts are typically manufactured in one country or region, then exported to another country or region for final assembly. Variant names include knockdown kit, knocked-down kit, or simply knockdown, and the abbreviated KD or CKD.\n\nA common form of knock-down is a complete knock-down (CKD), which is a kit of the completely non-assembled parts of a product. It is also a method of supplying parts to a market, particularly in shipping to foreign nations, and serves as a way of counting or pricing. CKD is a common practice in the automotive, bus, heavy truck and rail vehicle industries, as well as electronics, furniture and other products. Businesses sell knocked-down kits to their foreign affiliates or licensees for various reasons, including the avoidance of import taxes, to receive tax preferences for providing local manufacturing jobs, or even to be considered as a bidder at all (for example, in public transport projects with \"buy national\" rules).\n\nA semi-knocked-down kit (SKD) is a kit of the partially assembled parts of a product. It is also called an incompletely disassembled kit, although it has never been assembled. Both types of KDs, complete and incomplete, are collectively referred to within the auto industry as KDX (for knocked-down export), and cars assembled in the country of origin and exported whole to the destination market are known as BUX (for built-up export).\n\nTechnically, the terms \"knock-down\", \"incompletely disassembled kit\" and \"kits of parts\" are all misnomers, because the knock-downs were never built up in the first place, and the shipments of parts are often not in the form of kits, but rather bulk-packed by type of part into shipping containers. The degree of \"knock-down\" depends on the desires and technical abilities of the receiving organization, or on government import regulations. Developing nations may pursue trade and economic policies that call for import substitution or local content regulations. Companies with CKD operations help the country substitute the finished products it imports with locally assembled substitutes.\n\nKnock-down kit assembling plants are less expensive to establish and maintain, because they do not need modern robotic equipment, and the workforce is usually much less expensive in comparison to the home country. The plants may also be effective for low-volume production. The CKD concept allows firms in developing markets to gain expertise in a particular industry. At the same time, the CKD kit exporting company gains new markets that would otherwise be closed.\n\nIn the automotive industry, the most basic form of a vehicle in KD kit lacks the wheels, internal combustion engine, transmission, and battery. They are either supplied as \"parts\" for assembly (a \"complete\" kit), or obtained from third parties (an \"incomplete\" kit); all of the interiors are already installed at the originating factory. The term SKD for semi-knocked-down refers to a kit with a complete, welded car body, usually coated or already painted. To gain some extra tax preferences, the manufacturer needs to further \"localise\" the car, i.e. increase the share of parts produced by local manufacturers, such as tires, wheels, seats, headlights, windscreens and glass, batteries, interior plastics, etc., even down to the engine and transmission. At some point, the steel body could be pressed, welded, and painted locally, which effectively makes KD assembly only a couple of steps away from full-scale production.\n\nBy the time that Henry Ford co-wrote his 1922 memoir \"My Life and Work\", the Ford Motor Company was already shipping car parts from its Michigan plants for final assembly in the regions of the United States or foreign countries where the cars would be sold.\n\nDuring World War II, a great number of U.S. and Canadian-built vehicles — most notably light and heavy trucks like Willys MB/Ford GPW/GPA, GMC-353/CCKW and vehicles from the CMP family — were crated and shipped overseas in KD form, in various degrees of completeness, to Allied countries, in order to sustain their war effort. Assembly lines were preferably set up in local automotive factories where appropriate tooling and equipment could be easily found but, where needed, other types of buildings could be used, especially in on-the-field situations, and on occasion even open-air rebuilding camps were set up, managed by military personnel. Owing to male mobilization, sometimes a female workforce was employed. CKD military vehicles could be stored for shipment in one-vehicle-per-crate form (or SUP, Single Unit Pack), or as several vehicles (usually two to three) divided in two or more crates. Vehicles shipped to certain countries could be lacking some items, such as cabs, beds or tires, that were built and provided locally.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra Limited in India began its business in 1947 with assembling CKD Jeeps. Mahindra expanded their operations to include domestic manufacture of Jeep vehicles with a high level of local content under license from Kaiser Jeep Corporation and later American Motors (AMC).\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s Lotus Cars sold its Lotus Seven car in CKD form to avoid the UK purchase tax that applied to sales of fully assembled vehicles.\nBy 1959, and with the introduction of the Mini, the products of BMC were still either imported or assembled from CKD kits in several international markets.\n\nIn 1961, Renault began negotiations for a first partnership agreement with AMC for assembly of Rambler automobiles in Europe. Beginning in 1962, and continuing until 1967, AMC also sold CKD kits of its passenger cars to Renault. They were assembled in Renault's factory in Haren, Belgium and sold through its dealers in Algeria, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The deal allowed AMC to sell its cars in new markets without having to make a major Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The arrangement was good for the French automaker because its product range was lacking large cars and it needed to offer an \"executive\" model in its European markets. The situation had changed by 1977. It was now AMC that sought outside support for a new car in the United States sub-compact market segment, which led to the first of many agreements with Renault.\n\nVolvo's Halifax Assembly Plant, which opened 1963, completed vehicles in CKD form from Sweden for North American consumers. Halifax Assembly closed in December 1998.\n\nIn 1967, Rootes Group UK began exporting CKD Hillman Hunters to Iran where they were sold as the Paykan (meaning \"arrow\" in Persian). Bought by Chrysler in 1967 and then part of the sale to the PSA Group by the Chrysler Corporation of its European operations in late 1978, the Rootes business basis in Iran became the primer for the very significant PSA Peugeot Citroën business in Iran involving engine and CKD deliveries, particularly from the 405, introduced in 1990 and facelifted as the Pars in 1999 and 206 introduced in 2001. In 2004, Peugeot's partner Iran Khodro produced 281'000 Peugeot vehicles, securing a 36% market share.\n\nIn 1967 as well, Peugeot introduced CKD-based production of a light pick-up vehicle based on the Peugeot 403 in Peugeot's Berazategui factory (in Buenos Aires) under the name Peugeot 4TB. In 1973, this model was replaced by the 404 pick-up and later (1990) by the 504 pick-up. The 404 and 504 were massively marketed worldwide through local CKD assembly shops: the 404 was assembled, besides France and Argentina, in Australia, Belgium, Canada (at the SOMA plant shared with Renault), Chile, Ireland, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Portugal, Perú, Rhodesia, South Africa and Uruguay; the 504, mainly in Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, South-Africa, Australia and China by the Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Company which developed a specific crew cab version.\nIn 1968, the independent German automotive firm, Karmann, began assembly of CKD kits of AMC's newly introduced Javelin for distribution in Europe. American Motors also provided right hand drive versions of their automobiles to markets such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The components were shipped in containers to Australia from AMC's plants in Kenosha, Wisconsin, or Brampton, Ontario. Assembly of Rambler and AMC vehicles in Australia was done by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Local content requirements were met by using Australian suppliers for the interiors (seats, carpeting, etc.) as well as for lights, heaters, and other components. Various Rambler models were assembled in New Zealand from the early 1960s until 1971 by Campbell Motors in Thames (later Toyota New Zealand), which had also built Toyota, Datsun, Hino, Renault, and Peugeot cars.\n\nNew Zealand had developed a car assembly industry as a means of import substitution and providing local employment, despite the small size of the local market. Following economic reforms in the 1980s, including the lowering of import tariffs, the ability to import Australian-built vehicles duty-free under the CER agreement, many car companies ended assembly in New Zealand and switched to importing completely built up vehicles from Japan, Australia, or Europe. More significantly, the easing of import restrictions led to a large number of Japanese used imports, which were far cheaper than locally assembled used cars, and continue to outnumber so-called 'NZ New' vehicles. The last companies to assemble CKD kits in New Zealand were Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Honda, which closed their plants in 1998, when the government announced plans to abolish import tariffs on cars.\n\nMore recent examples include Ukraine, which has almost prohibitive import taxes on finished cars. AutoZAZ assembles CKD kits of some Lada, Opel, Mercedes-Benz, and Daewoo cars. It went as far as adopting a version of Daewoo Lanos for full-scale production and equipping it with a domestic engine. The German automotive giant - Volkswagen Group also produces SKDs in the Ukraine at its Solomonovo plant, producing cars under its Škoda and Volkswagen Passenger Cars marques.\n\nIn Russia, the most well-known KD assembling facilities are owned by Avtotor, which produces Hummer H2, BMW 3 Series and BMW 5 Series in Kaliningrad, and Renault Logan in Moscow using facilities that once belonged to AZLK. In Kaluga, Volkswagen Group is currently constructing a new plant, which when completed, is expected to have an annual output of 150,000 units.\n\nDaimler AG has a CKD assembly plant in South Carolina that re-assembles Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans for sale in the United States and Canada at Mercedes-Benz and Freightliner dealers, along with Dodge dealers prior to Fiat Group's takeover of Chrysler Group LLC — essentially to circumvent the 25% tariff on imported light trucks known as the \"Chicken Tax\". The Sprinter was eventually replaced in the Dodge/Ram lineup with the similar Ram ProMaster, a rebadged Fiat Ducato. Unlike the CKD Dodge Sprinter, the ProMaster is fully imported to the U.S. from a Chrysler plant in Mexico, which is part of the North American Free Trade Agreement and not subject to the Chicken Tax.\n\nIn 2009, Mahindra & Mahindra Limited announced that it would export pickup trucks powered by diesel engines from India to the United States in knockdown kit (CKD) form, again to circumvent the chicken tax. Mahindra planned to export CKDs to the United States as complete vehicles that will be assembled in the United States from kits of parts shipped in crates. However, Mahindra's United States CKD and export plans never materialized and were subject to several lawsuits.\n\nSince 2013 Tesla operates an assembly plant in Tilburg, Netherlands. It is used for the assembly of their fully electric Model S sedan and Model X SUV for the European Union, but not all of Europe since only cars imported to the EU benefit from circumventing the 10% import duty (e.g. cars to Norway are shipped directly from the United States). For the most part the car is still manufactured in the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. During the final assembly in the Netherlands various parts are added to the car most notably the rear subframe with the drive train as well as the battery pack.\n\n\n\nUnserviceable military aircraft are also sold as \"knock-downs\" after they have ended their service life, packaging them with serviceable aircraft. This allows them to be used for cannibalization of spare parts.\n\nThe European aircraft manufacturer Airbus uses knock-down kits to assemble A320 family aircraft outside Europe. The Airbus A320 final assembly line in Tianjin, China assembles fuselage, wing, and tail sections made in Europe with avionics and engines made in Europe or the United States and locally sourced components for interiors. Airbus has opened a similar A320 final assembly line in the United States in September 2015, located in Mobile, Alabama; again using European-made fuselages, wings, and tail sections. However, the Mobile final assembly line will use more locally sourced components than the Tianjin line; engines, interior components, and avionics will be sourced mainly from American suppliers. Both the Airbus Tianjin and Mobile plants receive their fuselages, wings, and tail sections from Europe via ocean freight using specially designed ships, as the plants are located in port cities.\n\nA 1908 advertisement in \"Popular Mechanics\" attests that knock-down kits for houses were on the market by the early 20th century, if not before.\n\n"}

A factor not limiting over a certain domain of starting conditions may yet be limiting over another domain of starting conditions, including that of the factor.\n\nThe identification of a factor as limiting only in distinction to one or more other factors that are non-limiting. Disciplines differ in their use of the term as to whether they allow the simultaneous existence of more than one limiting factor (which may then be called \"co-limiting\"), but they all require the existence of at least one non-limiting factor when the terms are used. There are several different possible scenarios of limitation when more than one factor is present. The first scenario, called \"single limitation\" occurs when only one factor, the one with maximum demand, limits the system. \"Serial co-limitation\" is when one factor has no direct limiting effects on the system, but must be present to increase the limitation of a second factor. A third scenario, \"independent limitation,\" occurs when two factors both have limiting effects on the system but work through different mechanisms. Another scenario, \"synergistic limitation,\" occurs when both factors contribute to the same limitation mechanism, but in different ways.\n\nIn \"ecology\", common limiting factor resources are environmental conditions that limit the growth, abundance, or distribution of an organism or a population of organisms in an ecosystem. The concept of limiting factors is based on \"Liebig's Law of the Minimum,\" which states that growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource. In other words, a factor is limiting if a change in the factor produces increased growth, abundance, or distribution of an organism, when other factors necessary to the organisms life do not. Limiting factors may be physical or biological.\n\nLimiting factors are not limited to the condition of the species. Some factors may be increased or reduced based on circumstances. An example of a limiting factor is sunlight in the rain forest, where growth is limited to all plants on the forest floor unless more light becomes available. This decreases a number of potential factors that could influence a biological process, but only one is in effect at any one place and time. This recognition that there is always a \"single\" limiting factor is vital in ecology; and the concept has parallels in numerous other processes. The limiting factor also causes competition between individuals of a species population. For example, space is a limiting factor. Many predators and prey need a certain amount of space for survival: food, water, and other biological needs. If the population of a species is too high, they start competing for those needs. Thus the limiting factors hold down population in an area by causing some individuals to seek better prospects elsewhere and others to stay and starve. Some other limiting factors in biology include temperature and other weather related factors. Species can also be limited by the availability of macro- and micronutrients. There has even been evidence of co-limitation in prairie ecosystems. A study published in 2017 showed that sodium (a micronutrient) had no effect on its own, but when in combination with nitrogen and phosphorus (macronutrients), it did show positive effects, which is evidence of serial co-limitation.\n\nAllBusiness.com defines a limiting (constraining) factor as an \"item that restricts or limits production or sale of a given product\". The examples provided include: \"limited machine hours and labor-hours and shortage of materials and skilled labor. Other limiting factors may be cubic feet of display or warehouse space, or working capital.\" The term is also frequently used in technology literature.\n\nThe analysis of limiting business factors is part of the program evaluation and review technique, critical path analysis, and theory of constraints as presented in the novel \"The Goal\".\n\nIn the design of chemical reactions to produce a chemical product, one of the reagents may be consumed by the reaction before the others. The amount of product is limited by the supply of this reagent. This limiting reagent determines the theoretical yield of the reaction.\n\n\n"}

The project has been opposed by environmentalists since it seeks to pull down 1200 acres of old sal forests for a coal mine. At least 500,000 prime sal trees would be chopped, and 54 villages with a considerable tribal population would be displaced. However, a group of villagers have also been supporting the mine since it would boost the local economy.\n\nMahan Coal Ltd is a Rs 5,000-crore joint venture between Essar Energy and the Aditya Birla Group (Hindalco).\n\nPart of the controversy is based on claims by Greenpeace India that the sanction for the coal mine was given based on a Gram Sabha (village board) resolution that had been forged. The land was allocated to the company based on this document. However, in 2014, the coal block land was deallocated by the Supreme Court resulting in sharp drops in the company's stocks.\n\nIts original allocation in 2006 is part of the Indian coal allocation scam. During investigations, the Ministry of Power stated that it had opposed a role for Hindalco in the mine, but the coal ministry under Manmohan Singh allocated the mine to the joint company.\n\nSince the BJP government came to power, the project has seen considerable support, and has been linked in the media for the Government actions against Greenpeace India.\n\nIn January 2015, Priya Pillai, a Greenpeace campaigner very active in Mahan, was offloaded from a flight while she was to meet some British MPs inquiring into the matter.

In the WTO, tariff commitments for goods are agreed upon and set out in each member's schedules of concessions on goods. The schedules represent commitments not to apply tariffs above the listed rates — these rates are “bound”. Under WTO rules, bound rates may not be raised without compensating the affected members.\n\nNon-tariff measures (NTMs) are non-tariff policy measures that affect international trade. NTMs cover a broad range of measures both directly and indirectly related to trade, and their use has risen as tariff rates have fallen under subsequent WTO negotiation rounds. In many cases, NTMs can be classified as non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs). Some areas of NTMs are dealt with under specific WTO agreements, notably the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, the Anti-dumping agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the Agreement on Safeguards. WTO Members seek to continually improve market access through the regular WTO work programme and through negotiations such as those launched at the Doha Ministerial Conference in November 2001.\n\nCountries have various different systems controlling the import of products. Often authorization from certification bodies and/or international product certification is required. An overview of market access regulations can be given for example by http://fita.org/countries/ or http://www.macmap.org/.\n\nMarket Access is also used in Pharmacoeconomics and refers to the process by which a company gets a drug to market so that it becomes available for patients. Access is defined as a patient's ability to obtain medical care. Ease of access is determined by such factors as the availability of medical services and their acceptability to the patient, location of health care facilities, the transportation, the hours of operation and cost of care. Evidence-Based Market Access (see Evidence-based medicine) refers to a process for producing Market Access reports based on scientific, preferably peer-reviewed and referenced material.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54601961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54601961", "title": "Municipally owned corporation", "text": "Municipally owned corporation\n\nMunicipally owned corporations are corporations owned by municipalities. They are typically \"organisations with independent corporate status, managed by an executive board appointed primarily by local government officials, and with majority public ownership.\" Some municipally owned corporations rely on revenue from user fees, distinguishing them from agencies and special districts funded through taxation. Municipally owned corporations may also differ from local bureaucracies in funding, transaction costs, financial scrutiny, labour rights, permission to operate outside their jurisdiction, and, under some circumstances, in rights to make profits and risk of bankruptcy.\n\nThe causes and effects of municipally owned corporations are posited to be different from those of state-owned enterprises. Corporatization may be more utilised locally than nationally a way to allow hybrid or flexible forms of public service delivery such as public-private partnerships and inter-municipal cooperation. It also allows charging user fees. Effects can be different because of lower regulator expertise, lower contracting capacity for municipalities, and the higher presence of scale economies. Current research shows that municipally owned corporations are frequently more efficient than bureaucracy but have higher failure rates because of their legal and managerial autonomy. An additional problem is the fact that municipally owned corporations often have more than one municipal owner, and conflict between municipal owners can lead to reduced output for the municipally owned corporation due to various negative spillovers.\n\nUnder New Public Management, corporatization became prominent as a step towards (partial) privatization. It soon became an end in itself, aiming to combine government control with efficient, businesslike service delivery that was considered lacking in bureaucratic service delivery. The state-owned enterprises that resulted were to be organized akin to private corporations, with the difference that the company's shares remain state ownership are not traded on the stock market.\n\nThis also became a trend at the local level. Municipal corporation followed a process of externalization that required new skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and followed common changes in the institutional landscape of public services. There was a substantial growth in the number of municipally owned corporations in the 1990s and 2000s throughout Europe and the United States.\n\nMunicipal corporatization can be used to improve efficiency of public service delivery (with mixed successes) or as a step towards (partial) privatization or hybridization. Its reasons and effects are somewhat similar as those of corporatization.\n\nA key purpose of corporatization is externalization. Such externalization gives the service delivery organization legal and managerial autonomy from politicians, which could potentially increase efficiency, because it safeguards the firm from political exploitation. However, it can also fail to bring efficiency (or cause inefficiency), because this autonomy also reduces the government's ability to monitor its management. Whether corporatization is beneficial may depend on the nature of the service that is corporatized, where autonomy may be less beneficial for more politicized and complex services. At the local level there may also be higher transaction costs, because contracting capacity may be lower.\n\nOnce a service has been corporatised, it is often relatively easy to (partially) privatise it by selling some or all of the company's shares via the stock market. Thus corporatisation can be a stop on the way towards (partial) privatization. Corporatization also can be a step towards the creation of hybrid forms of organization, such as institutional private-partnerships or inter-municipal service organizations, which are especially relevant at the local level because of opportunities to capture scale economies.\n\nMunicipal corporations tend to be established by local governments experiencing some degree of fiscal stress. Corporatization was a way to allow local governments to \"hide their liabilities by allocating them partly to their companies\" or \"corporatized their utilities (…) to raise new sources of income from their companies.\"\n\nThe frequent ownership of municipally owned corporations by multiple municipalities can cause problems, the so-called 'multiple principal problem', that can lead these to be inefficient or have high failure rates. There can be free-riding or duplication in steering and monitoring procedures, resulting in high costs. If there is heterogeneity in interests between the multiple municipalities, there may be directive ambiguity or lobbying of the corporations by individual municipalities, leading to high inefficiency. Delegating governance to one elected party may be a way to solve this problem.\n\nMunicipal corporatization is more prominent for some services than for others. It is typically prominent in:\n"}

One of the largest contemporary art institutions in the Southeastern United States, it presents exhibitions by international, national and regional artists.\n\nMOCA Jacksonville was founded in 1924 as the Jacksonville Fine Arts Society, the first organization in the Jacksonville community devoted to the visual arts. In 1948 the Museum was incorporated as the Jacksonville Art Museum, and in 1978 it became the first institution in Jacksonville to be accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.\n\nIn late 1999 the Museum acquired its permanent home, the historic Western Union Telegraph Building on Hemming Plaza, adjacent to the newly renovated City Hall, and became the Jacksonville Museum of Modern Art (JMOMA). In 2000, a series of preview exhibitions opened in a temporary exhibition space while the building facade was restored to its original Art Deco style. The interior was completely refurbished to house the Museum’s galleries, educational facilities, a theater/auditorium, Museum Shop and Café Nola. Total renovation of the , six-floor facility was completed in 2003, culminating in a grand re-opening in May of that year.\n\nAfter moving to its downtown location the Museum experienced rapid growth in both membership and the size of the permanent collection. The many substantial additions to the collection increased not only its quality, but also its size to almost 800 pieces. After completing a recent review of the current scope of the Museum’s collection and exhibitions, discussions were held regarding the distinctions between modern and contemporary art, as well as the Museum’s mission and vision for the future. It was decided that in order for the Museum to convey a strong sense of identity and purpose to both the community and other art institutions across the country, its name should change. Therefore, in November 2006, JMOMA became the Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville.\n\nThe Museum continues to be a cornerstone of Jacksonville’s multibillion-dollar downtown revitalization plan. Its exhibitions and programming bring new visitors to the civic core during the day, at night and on weekends. Educational programming includes children’s literacy initiatives and weekend art making classes as well as regular tours, lectures, films and publications for children and adults.\n\nMOCA Jacksonville is an inviting environment in which to learn about the art of our time. Stroll through the permanent collection galleries and view the works of Hans Hofmann, Joan Mitchell, James Rosenquist, Ed Paschke, and other contemporary masters. MOCA Jacksonville’s changing exhibitions feature the works of many contemporary artists working in a wide assortment of media from painting, sculpture, and video. The third floor hosts exhibitions, which rotate approximately every four months, designed to provide insightful, stimulating and educational experiences.\n\nThe University of North Florida acquired the museum in 2009 to act as a cultural resource of the university.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

These chemicals can be used to alter the paper in many ways, including changing its color and brightness, or by increasing its strength and resistance to water.\n\nChemical pulping involves dissolving lignin in order to extract the cellulose from the wood fiber. The different processes of chemical pulping include the Kraft process, which uses caustic soda and sodium sulfide and is the most common; alternatively, the use of sulfurous acid is known as the sulfite process, the neutral sulfite semichemical is treated as a third process separate from sulfite, and soda pulping which is the least ecologically hazardous utilizing sodium hydroxide or anthraquinone.\n\nCaustic soda is added to increase the pH in the pulping process of fibers. The higher pH of the paper-fiber solution causes the fibers to smoothen and swell, which is important for the grinding process of the fibers.\n\nIn the production of white paper, the wood pulp is bleached to remove any color from the trace amounts of lignin that was not extracted in the chemical pulping process. There are three predominant methods of bleaching:\n\nMost paper types must have some water-resistance to maintain a specific writing quality and printability. Until 1980, the typical manner of adding this resistance was by using a rosin in combination with alum. When the paper industry started using chalk instead of china clay as filler, the paper chemistry had to switch to a neutral process. Today, mainly AKD (alkyl ketene dimer) and ASA (alkenyl succinic anhydride) are used.\n\nWet-strength additives ensure that paper retains its strength when it gets wet. This is especially important in tissue paper. Chemicals typically used for this purpose include epichlorohydrin, melamine, urea formaldehyde and polyimines. These substances polymerize in the paper and result in the construction of a strengthening network.\n\nTo enhance the paper's strength, cationic starch is added to wet pulp in the manufacturing process. Starch has a similar chemical structure as the cellulose fibre of the pulp, and the surface of both the starch and fibre are negatively charged. By adding cationic (positive charged) starch, the fibre can bind with the starch and thus also increase the interconnections between the fibres. The positively charged portion of the starch is usually formed by quaternary ammonium cations. Quaternary salts that are used include 2.3-epoxy propyl trimethyl ammoniumchloride (EPTAC, also known as or Glytac Quab, GMAC™) and (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride (CHPTAC, also known as Quat 188, Quab 188, Reagens™).\n\nDry-strength additives, or dry-strengthening agents, are chemicals that improve paper strength normal conditions. These improve the paper's compression strength, bursting strength, tensile breaking strength, and delamination resistance. Typical chemicals used include cationic starch and polyacrylamide (PAM) derivatives. These substances work by binding fibers, often under the aid of aluminum ions in paper sheet.\n\nBinders promote the binding of pigment particles between themselves and the coating layer of the paper. Binders are spherical particles less than 1 µm in diameter. Common binders are styrene maleic anhydride copolymer or styrene-acrylate copolymer. The surface chemical composition is differentiated by the adsorption of acrylic acid or an anionic surfactant, both of which are used for stabilization of the dispersion in water. Co-binders, or thickeners, are generally water-soluble polymers that influence the paper's color viscosity, water retention, sizing, and gloss. Some common examples are carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), cationic and anionic hydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC), modified starch, and dextrin.\nStyrene butadiene latex, Styrene acrylic, dextrin, oxidized starch are used in coatings to bind the filler to the paper. Co-binders are natural products such as starch and CMC (Carboxymethyl cellulose), that are used along with the synthetic binders, like styrene acrylic or styrene butadiene. Co-binders are used to reduce the cost of the synthetic binder and improve the water retention and rheology of the coating.\n\nMineral fillers are used to lower the consumption of more expensive binder material or to improve some properties of the paper. China clay, calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide, and talc are common mineral fillers used in paper production.\n\nA Retention agent is added to bind fillers to the paper. Fillers, such as calcium carbonate, usually have a weak surface charge. The retention agent is a polymer with high cationic, positively charged groups. An additional feature of a retention agent is to accelerate the dewatering in the wire section of the paper machine. Polyethyleneimine and polyacrylamide are examples of chemicals used in this process.\n\nPigments that absorb in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum can be added. As the dye absorbs light, the brightness of the paper will decrease, unlike the effect of an optical-brightening agent. To increase whiteness, a combination of pigments and an optical-brightening agent are often used. The most commonly used pigments are blue and violet dyes.\n\nOptical brightener is used to make paper appear whiter. Optical-brightening agents use fluorescence to absorb invisible radiation from the ultraviolet part of the light spectrum and re-emit the radiation as light in the visible blue range. The optical-brightening agent thus generates blue light that is added to the reflected light. The additional blue light offsets the yellowish tinge that would otherwise exist in the reflected light characteristics. It thus increases the brightness of the material (when the illumination includes ultraviolet radiation).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "491484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=491484", "title": "Paper machine", "text": "Paper machine\n\nA paper machine (or paper-making machine) is an industrial machine used in the pulp and paper industry\nto create paper in large quantities at high speed. Modern paper-making machines are based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a moving woven mesh to create a continuous paper web by filtering out the fibres held in a paper stock and producing a continuously moving wet mat of fibre. This is dried in the machine to produce a strong paper web. \n\nThe basic process is an industrialised version of the historical process of hand paper-making, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of a printing and writing substrate. The first modern paper machine was invented in Britain by Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier, and patented in 1806.\n\nThe same process is used to produce paperboard on a paperboard machine.\n\nPaper machines usually have at least five distinct operational sections:\n\nThere can also be a coating section to modify the surface characteristics with coatings such as china clay.\n\nBefore the invention of continuous paper making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mould or dipping and lifting the sheet mould from the vat. While still on the fabric in the sheet mould, the wet paper is pressed to remove excess water and then the sheet is lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry.\n\nIn 1799, Louis-Nicolas Robert of Essonnes, France, was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine. At the time Robert was working for Saint-Léger Didot, with whom he quarreled over the ownership of the invention. Didot thought that England was a better place to develop the machine. But during the troubled times of the French Revolution, he could not go there himself, so he sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, an Englishman living in Paris. Through a chain of acquaintances, Gamble was introduced to the brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, stationers of London, who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on 20 October 1801. The Fourdrinier machine used a specially woven fabric mesh conveyor belt (known as a \"wire,\" as it was once woven from bronze) in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous paper web. The original Fourdrinier forming section used a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the \"drainage table\".\n\nWith the help particularly of Bryan Donkin, a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at Frogmore Paper Mill, Apsley, Hertfordshire, in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at Two Waters. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at St Neots intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.\n\nThomas Gilpin is most often credited for creating the first U.S cylinder type papermaking machine at Brandywine Creek, Delaware in 1817. This machine was also developed in England, but it was a cylinder mould machine. The Fourdrinier machine wasn't introduced into the USA until 1827.\n\nRecords show Charles Kinsey of Paterson, NJ had already patented a continuous process papermaking machine in 1807. Kinsey’s machine was built locally by Daniel Sawn and by 1809 the Kinsey machine was successfully making paper at the Essex Mill in Paterson. Financial stress and potential opportunities created by the Embargo of 1807 eventually persuaded Kinsey and his backers to change the mill’s focus from paper to cotton and Kinsey's early papermaking successes were soon overlooked and forgotten.\n\nGilpin's 1817 patent was similar to Kinsey's, as was the John Ames patent of 1822. The Ames patent was challenged by his competitors, asserting that Kinsey was the original inventor and Ames had been pilfering other peoples' ideas, their evidence being the employment of Daniel Sawn to work on his machine.\n\nThe method of continuous production demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other continuous production processes.\n\nThe plant fibres used for pulp are composed mostly of cellulose and hemi-cellulose, which have a tendency to form molecular linkages between fibres in the presence of water. After the water evaporates the fibres remain bonded. It is not necessary to add additional binders for most paper grades, although both wet and dry strength additives may be added.\n\nRags of cotton and linen were the major source of pulp for paper before wood pulp. Today almost all pulp is of wood fibre. Cotton fibre is used in speciality grades, usually in printing paper for such things as resumes and currency.\n\nSources of rags often appear as waste from other manufacturing such as denim fragments or glove cuts. Fibres from clothing come from the cotton boll. The fibres can range from 3 to 7 cm in length as they exist in the cotton field. Bleach and other chemicals remove the colour from the fabric in a process of cooking, usually with steam. The cloth fragments mechanically abrade into fibres, and the fibres get shortened to a length appropriate for manufacturing paper with a cutting process. Rags and water dump into a trough forming a closed loop. A cylinder with cutting edges, or knives, and a knife bed is part of the loop. The spinning cylinder pushes the contents of the trough around repeatedly. As it lowers slowly over a period of hours, it breaks the rags up into fibres, and cuts the fibres to the desired length. The cutting process terminates when the mix has passed the cylinder enough times at the programmed final clearance of the knives and bed.\n\nAnother source of cotton fibre comes from the cotton ginning process. The seeds remain, surrounded by short fibres known as linters for their short length and resemblance to lint. Linters are too short for successful use in fabric. Linters removed from the cotton seeds are available as first and second cuts. The first cuts are longer.\n\nThe two major classifications of pulp are chemical and mechanical. Chemical pulps formerly used a sulphite process, but the kraft process is now predominant. Kraft pulp has superior strength to sulphite and mechanical pulps and kraft process spent pulping chemicals are easier to recover and regenerate. Both chemical pulps and mechanical pulps may be bleached to a high brightness.\n\nChemical pulping dissolves the lignin that bonds fibres to one another, and binds the outer fibrils that compose individual fibres to the fibre core. Lignin, like most other substances that can separate fibres from one another, acts as a debonding agent, lowering strength. Strength also depends on maintaining long cellulose molecule chains. The kraft process, due to the alkali and sulphur compounds used, tends to minimize attack on the cellulose and the non-crystalline hemicellulose, which promotes bonding, while dissolving the lignin. Acidic pulping processes shorten the cellulose chains.\n\nKraft pulp makes superior linerboard and excellent printing and writing papers.\n\nGroundwood, the main ingredient used in newsprint and a principal component of magazine papers (coated publications), is literally ground wood produced by a grinder. Therefore, it contains a lot of lignin, which lowers its strength. The grinding produces very short fibres that drain slowly.\n\nThermomechanical pulp (TMP) is a variation of groundwood where fibres are separated mechanically while at high enough temperatures to soften the lignin.\n\nBetween chemical and mechanical pulps there are semi-chemical pulps that use a mild chemical treatment followed by refining. Semi-chemical pulp is often used for corrugating medium.\n\nBales of recycled paper (normally old corrugated containers) for unbleached (brown) packaging grades may be simply pulped, screened and cleaned. Recycling to make white papers is usually done in a deinking plant, which employs screening, cleaning, washing, bleaching and flotation. Deinked pulp is used in printing and writing papers and in tissue, napkins and paper towels. It is often blended with virgin pulp.\n\nAt integrated pulp and paper mills, pulp is usually stored in high density towers before being pumped to stock preparation. Non integrated mills use either dry pulp or wet lap (pressed) pulp, usually received in bales. The pulp bales are slushed in a [re]pulper.\n\nStock preparation is the area where pulp is usually refined, blended to the appropriate proportion of hardwood, softwood or recycled fibre, and diluted to as uniform and constant as possible consistency. The pH is controlled and various fillers, such as whitening agents, size and wet strength or dry strength are added if necessary. Additional fillers such as clay, calcium carbonate and titanium dioxide increase opacity so printing on reverse side of a sheet will not distract from content on the obverse side of the sheet. Fillers also improve printing quality.\n\nPulp is pumped through a sequence of tanks that are commonly called \"chests\", which may be either round or more commonly rectangular. Historically these were made of special ceramic tile faced reinforced concrete, but mild and stainless steels are also used. Low consistency pulp slurries are kept agitated in these chests by propeller like agitators near the pump suction at the chest bottom.\n\nIn the following process, different types of pulp, if used, are normally treated in separate but similar process lines until combined at a blend chest:\n\nFrom high density storage or from slusher/pulper the pulp is pumped to a low density storage chest (tank). From there it is typically diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest. From the unrefined stock chest stock is again pumped, with consistency control, through a refiner. Refining is an operation whereby the pulp slurry passes between a pair of discs, one of which is stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60 Hz AC, respectively. The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance. This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the fibrils of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength. For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly refined. Refined stock from the refiner then goes to a refined stock chest, or blend chest, if used as such.\n\nHardwood fibres are typically 1 mm long and smaller in diameter than the 4 mm length typical of softwood fibres. Refining can cause the softwood fibre tube to collapse resulting in undesirable properties in the sheet.\n\nFrom the refined stock, or blend chest, stock is again consistency controlled as it is being pumped to a machine chest. It may be refined or additives may be added en route to the machine chest.\n\nThe machine chest is basically a consistency levelling chest having about 15 minutes retention. This is enough retention time to allow any variations in consistency entering the chest to be levelled out by the action of the basis weight valve receiving feedback from the on line basis weight measuring scanner. (Note: Many paper machines mistakenly control consistency coming out of the machine chest, interfering with basis weight control.)\n\nThere are four main sections on this paper machine. The forming section makes the pulp into the basis of for sheets along the wire. The press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press felts that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water. The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally steam-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. In practice calender rolls are normally placed vertically in a \"stack\".\n\nFrom the machine chest stock is pumped to a head tank, commonly called a \"head tank\" or \"stuff box\", whose purpose is to maintain a constant head (pressure) on the fiber slurry or \"stock\" as it feeds the basis weight valve. The stuff box also provides a means allowing air bubbles to escape. The consistency of the pulp slurry at the stuff box is in the 3% range. Flow from the stuff box is by gravity and is controlled by the basis weight valve on its way to the fan pump suction where it injected into main flow of water to the fan pump. The main flow of water pumped by the fan pump is from a whitewater chest or tank that collects all the water drained from the forming section of the paper machine. Before the fiber stream from the stuff box is introduced, the whitewater is very low in fiber content. The whitewater is constantly recirculated by the fan pump through the headbox and recollected from the wire pit and various other tanks and chests that receive drainage from the forming wire and vacuum assisted drainage from suction boxes and wet fiber web handling rolls. On the way to the head box the pulp slurry may pass through centrifugal cleaners, which remove heavy contaminants like sand, and screens, which break up fibre clumps and remove over-sized debris. The fan pump ultimately feeds the headbox, whether or not any centrifugal cleaners or screens are present.\n\nThe purpose of the headbox is create turbulence to keep the fibers from clumping together and to uniformly distribute the slurry across the width of the wire. Wood fibers have a tendency to attract one another, forming clumps, the effect being called flocculation. Flocculation is lessened by lowering consistency and or by agitating the slurry; however, de-flocculation becomes very difficult at much above 0.5% consistency. Minimizing the degree of flocculation when forming is important to physical properties of paper.\n\nThe consistency in the headbox is typically under 0.4% for most paper grades, with longer fibres requiring lower consistency than short fibres. Higher consistency causes more fibres to be oriented in the z direction, while lower consistency promotes fibre orientation in the x-y direction. Higher consistency promotes higher calliper (thickness) and stiffness, lower consistency promotes higher tensile and some other strength properties and also improves formation (uniformity). Many sheet properties continue to improve down to below 0.1% consistency; however, this is an impractical amount of water to handle. (Most paper machine run a higher headbox consistency than optimum because they have been sped up over time without replacing the fan pump and headbox. There is also an economic trade off with high pumping costs for lower consistency).\n\nThe stock slurry, often called \"white water\" at this point, exits the head box through a rectangular opening of adjustable height called the \"slice\", the white water stream being called the \"jet\" and it is pressurized on high speed machines so as to land gently on the moving fabric loop or \"wire\" at a speed typically between plus or minus 3% of the wire speed, called \"rush\" and \"drag\" respectively. Excessive \"rush\" or \"drag\" causes more orientation of fibres in the machine direction and gives differing physical properties in machine and cross directions; however, this phenomenon is not completely avoidable on Fourdrinier machines.\n\nOn lower speed machines at 700 feet per minute, gravity and the height of the stock in the headbox creates sufficient pressure to form the jet through the opening of the slice. The height of the stock is the head, which gives the headbox its name. The speed of the jet compared to the speed of the wire is known as the \"jet-to-wire ratio\". When the jet-to-wire ratio is less than unity, the fibres in the stock become drawn out in the machine direction. On slower machines where sufficient liquid remains in the stock before draining out, the wire can be driven back and forth with a process known as \"shake\". This provides some measure of randomizing the direction of the fibres and gives the sheet more uniform strength in both the machine and cross-machine directions. On fast machines, the stock does not remain on the wire in liquid form long enough and the long fibres line up with the machine. When the jet-to-wire ratio exceeds unity, the fibers tend to pile up in lumps. The resulting variation in paper density provides the antique or parchment paper look.\n\nTwo large rolls typically form the ends of the drainage section, which is called the \"drainage table\". The \"breast roll\" is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre. At the other end of the drainage table is the suction (\"couch\") roll. The couch roll is a hollow shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5 mm diameter. The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary suction box, normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine. Vacuum is pulled on the suction box, which draws water from the web into the suction box. From the suction roll the sheet feeds into the press section.\n\nDown machine from the suction roll, and at a lower elevation, is the \"wire turning roll\". This roll is driven and pulls the wire around the loop. The wire turning roll has a considerable angle of wrap in order to grip the wire.\n\nSupporting the wire in the drainage table area are a number of drainage elements. In addition to supporting the wire and promoting drainage, the elements de-flocculate the sheet. On low speed machines these table elements are primarily \"table rolls\". As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a table roll increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the vacuum area and causes stock to jump off the wire, disrupting the formation. To prevent this drainage foils are used. The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action. Where rolls and foils are used, rolls are used near the headbox and foils further down machine.\n\nApproaching the dry line on the table are located low vacuum boxes that are drained by a barometric leg under gravity pressure. After the dry line are the suction boxes with applied vacuum. Suction boxes extend up to the couch roll. At the couch the sheet consistency should be about 25%.\n\nThe forming section type is usually based on the grade of paper or paperboard being produced; however, many older machines use a less than optimum design. Older machines can be upgraded to include more appropriate forming sections.\n\nA second headbox may be added to a conventional fourdrinier to put a different fibre blend on top of a base layer. A \"secondary headbox\" is normally located at a point where the base sheet is completely drained. This is not considered a separate ply because the water action does a good job of intermixing the fibers of the top and bottom layer. Secondary headboxes are common on linerboard.\n\nA modification to the basic fourdrinier table by adding a second wire on top of the drainage table is known as a top wire former. The bottom and top wires converge and some drainage is up through the top wire. A top wire improves formation and also gives more drainage, which is useful for machines that have been sped up.\n\nThe Twin Wire Machine or Gap former uses two vertical wires in the forming section, thereby increasing the de-watering rate of the fibre slurry while also giving uniform two sidedness.\n\nThere are also machines with entire Fourdrinier sections mounted above a traditional Fourdrinier. This allows making multi-layer paper with special characteristics. These are called top Fourdriniers and they make multi-ply paper or paperboard. Commonly this is used for making a top layer of bleached fibre to go over an unbleached layer.\n\nAnother type forming section is the cylinder mould machine using a mesh-covered rotating cylinder partially immersed in a tank of fibre slurry in the wet end to form a paper web, giving a more random distribution of the cellulose fibres. Cylinder machines can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher calliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD). High MD stiffness is useful in food packaging like cereal boxes and other boxes like dry laundry detergent.\n\nTissue machines typically form the paper web between a wire and a special fabric (felt) as they wrap around a forming roll. The web is pressed from the felt directly onto a large diameter dryer called a \"yankee\". The paper sticks to the yankee dryer and is peeled off with a scraping blade called a \"doctor\". Tissue machines operate at speeds of up to 2000 m/min.\n\nThe second section of the paper machine is the press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press felts that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water. The paper web consistency leaving the press section can be above 40%.\n\nPressing is the most efficient method of de-watering the sheet as only mechanical action is required. Press felts historically were made from wool. However, today they are nearly 100% synthetic. They are made up of a polyamide woven fabric with thick batt applied in a specific design to maximise water absorption.\n\nPresses can be single or double felted. A single felted press has a felt on one side and a smooth roll on the other. A double felted press has both sides of the sheet in contact with a press felt. Single felted nips are useful when mated against a smooth roll (usually in the top position), which adds a two-sidedness—making the top side appear smoother than the bottom. Double felted nips impart roughness on both sides of the sheet. Double felted presses are desirable for the first press section of heavy paperboard.\n\nSimple press rolls can be rolls with grooved or blind drilled surface. More advanced press rolls are suction rolls. These are rolls with perforated shell and cover. The shell made of metal material such as bronze stainless steel is covered with rubber or a synthetic material. Both shell and cover are drilled throughout the surface. A stationary suction box is fitted in the core of the suction roll to support the shell being pressed. End face mechanical seals are used for the interface between the inside surface of the shell and the suction box. For the smooth rolls, they are typically made of granite rolls. The granite rolls can be up to long and in diameter.\n\nConventional roll presses are configured with one of the press rolls is in a fixed position, with a mating roll being loaded against this fixed roll. The felts run through the nips of the press rolls and continues around a felt run, normally consisting of several felt rolls. During the dwell time in the nip, the moisture from the sheet is transferred to the press felt. When the press felt exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the press felt to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.\n\nSome grades of paper use suction pick up rolls that use vacuum to transfer the sheet from the couch to a lead in felt on the first press or between press sections. Pickup roll presses normally have a vacuum box that has two vacuum zones (low vacuum and high vacuum). These rolls have a large number of drilled holes in the cover to allow the vacuum to pass from the stationary vacuum box through the rotating roll covering. The low vacuum zone picks up the sheet and transfers, while the high vacuum zone attempts to remove moisture. Unfortunately, at high enough speed centrifugal force flings out vacuumed water, making this less effective for dewatering. Pickup presses also have standard felt runs with Uhle boxes. However, pickup press design is quite different, as air movement is important for the pickup and dewatering facets of its role.\n\nCrown Controlled Rolls (also known as CC Rolls) are usually the mating roll in a press arrangement. They have hydraulic cylinders in the press rolls that ensure that the roll does not bow. The cylinders connect to a shoe or multiple shoes to keep the crown on the roll flat, to counteract the natural \"bend\" in the roll shape due to applying load to the edges.\n\nExtended Nip Presses (or ENP) are a relatively modern alternative to conventional roll presses. The top roll is usually a standard roll, while the bottom roll is actually a large CC roll with an extended shoe curved to the shape of the top roll, surrounded by a rotating rubber belt rather than a standard roll cover. The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the de-watering. Compared to a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higher—delivering significant steam savings or speed increases. ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.\n\nThe dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally steam-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Steam pressures may range up to 160 psig. Steam enters the end of the dryer head (cylinder cap) through a steam joint and condensate exits through a siphon that goes from the internal shell to a centre pipe. From the centre pipe the condensate exits through a joint on the dryer head. Wide machines require multiple siphons. In faster machines, centrifugal force holds the condensate layer still against the shell and turbulence generating bars are typically used to agitate the condensate layer and improve heat transfer.\n\nThe sheet is usually held against the dryers by long felt loops on the top and bottom of each dryer section. The felts greatly improve heat transfer. Dryer felts are made of coarse thread and have a very open weave that is almost see through, It is common to have the first bottom dryer section unfelted to dump broke on the basement floor during sheet breaks or when threading the sheet.\n\nPaper dryers are typically arranged in groups called \"sections\" so that they can be run at a progressively slightly slower speed to compensate for sheet shrinkage as the paper dries. Some grades of paper may also stretch as they run through the machine, requiring increasing speed between sections. The gaps between sections are called \"draws\".\n\nThe drying sections are usually enclosed to conserve heat. Heated air is usually supplied to the pockets where the sheet breaks contact with the driers. This increases the rate of drying. The pocket ventilating tubes have slots along their entire length that face into the pocket. The dryer hoods are usually exhausted with a series of roof mounted hood exhausts fans down the dryer section.\n\nAdditional sizing agents, including resins, glue, or starch, can be added to the web to alter its characteristics. Sizing improves the paper's water resistance, decreases its ability to fuzz, reduces abrasiveness, and improves its printing properties and surface bond strength. These may be applied at the wet (internal sizing) or on the dry end (surface sizing), or both. At the dry end sizing is usually applied with a \"size press\". The size press may be a roll applicator (flooded nip) or Nozzle applicator . It is usually placed before the last dryer section. Some paper machines also make use of a 'coater' to apply a coating of fillers such as calcium carbonate or china clay usually suspended in a binder of cooked starch and styrene-butadiene latex. Coating produces a very smooth, bright surface with the highest printing qualities.\n\nA calender consists of two or more rolls, where pressure is applied to the passing paper. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. It also gives it a more uniform thickness. The pressure applied to the web by the rollers determines the finish of the paper.\n\nAfter calendering, the web has a moisture content of about 6% (depending on the furnish). The paper is wound onto metal spools using a large cylinder called a \"reel drum\". Constant nip pressure is maintained between the reel drum and the spool, allowing the resulting friction to spin the spool. Paper runs over the top of the reel drum and is wound onto the spool to create a \"master roll\".\n\nTo be able to keep the paper machine running continuously, the reel must be able to quickly switch from winding a finished roll to an empty spool without stopping the flow of paper. To accomplish this, each reel section will have two or more spools rotating through the process. Using an overhead crane, empty spools will be loaded onto two \"primary arms\" above the reel drum. When the master roll reaches its maximum diameter, the arms will lower the new spool into contact with the reel drum and a machine behind the drum will run a tape along the moving sheet of paper, swiftly tearing it and attaching incoming paper onto the new spool. The spool is then lowered onto the \"secondary arms\", which steadily guide the spool away from the reel drum as the diameter of paper on the spool increases.\nThe roll hardness should be checked, obtained and adjusted accordingly to insure that the roll hardness is within the acceptable range for the product.\nReels of paper wound up at the end of the drying process are the full trimmed width, minus shrinkage from drying, of the web leaving the wire. In the winder section reels of paper are slit into smaller rolls of a width and roll diameter range specified by a customer order. To accomplish this the reel is placed on an unwind stand and the distances between the slitters (sharp cutting wheels), are adjusted to the specified widths for the orders. The wider is run until the desired roll diameter is reached and the rolls are labeled according to size and order before being sent to shipping or the warehouse. A reel usually has sufficient diameter to make two or more sets of rolls.\n\nbroke: waste paper, either made during a sheet break or trimmings. It is gathered up and put in a repulper for recycling back into the process.\n\nconsistency: the percent dry fibre in a pulp slurry.\n\ncouch: French meaning \"to lie down\". Following the couch roll the sheet is lifted off the wire and transferred into the press section.\n\ndandy roll: a mesh covered hollow roll that rides on top of the Fourdrinier. It breaks up fibre clumps to improve the sheet formation and can also be used to make an imprint, as with laid paper. See also watermark.\n\nfan pump: the large pump that circulates white water from the white water chest to the headbox. The pump is a special low pulse design that minimizes the effect of vane pulses which would cause uneven basis weight of paper in the machine direction known as \"barring\". The flow from the fan pump may go through screens and cleaners, if used. On large paper machines fan pumps may be rated in tens of thousands of gallons per minute.\n\nfelt: a loop of fabric or synthetic material that goes between press rolls and serves as a place to receive the pressed out water. Felts also support the wet paper web and guide it through the press section. Felts are also used in the dryer section to keep the sheet in close contact with the dryers and increase heat transfer.\n\nfiller: a finely divided substance added to paper in the forming process. Fillers improve print quality, brightness and opacity. The most common fillers are clay and calcium carbonate. Titanium dioxide is a filler but also improves brightness and opacity. Use of calcium carbonate filler is the process called \"alkaline sizing\" and uses different chemistry than acid sizing. Alkaline sized paper has superior ageing properties.\n\nformation: the degree of uniformity of fiber distribution in finished paper, which is easily seen by holding paper up to the light.\n\nheadbox: the pressure chamber where turbulence is applied to break up fibre clumps in the slurry. The main job of the headbox is to distribute the fiber slurry uniformly across the wire.\n\nnip: the contact area where two opposing rolls meet, such as in a press or calender.\n\npH: the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution. Alkaline paper has a very long life. Acid paper deteriorates over time, which caused libraries to either take conservation measures or replace many older books.\n\nsize: a chemical (formerly rosin derived but now a different chemical) or starch, applied to paper to retard the rate of water penetration. Sizing prevents \"bleeding\" of ink during printing, improving the sharpness of printing.\n\nslice: the adjustable rectangular orifice, usually at the bottom of the headbox, through which the whitewater jet discharges onto the wire. The slice opening and water pressure together determine the amount and velocity of whitewater flow through the slice. The slice usually has some form of adjustment mechanism to even out the paper weight profile across the machine (CD profile), although a newer methods is to inject water into the whitewater across the headbox slice area, thereby using localized consistency to control CD weight profile.\n\nstock: a pulp slurry that has been processed in the stock preparation area with necessary additives, refining and pH adjustment and ready for making paper\n\nweb: the continuous flow of un-dried fibre from the couch roll down the paper machine\n\nwhite water: filtrate from the drainage table. The white water from the table is usually stored in a white water chest from which it is pumped by the fan pump to the headbox.\n\nwire: the woven mesh fabric loop that is used for draining the pulp slurry from the headbox. Until the 1970s bronze wires were used but now they are woven from coarse mono-filament synthetics similar to fishing line but very stiff.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in the Pulp and Paper industry for two primary reasons, to avoid iron contamination of the product and their corrosion resistance to the various chemicals used in the paper making process. Type 316 stainless steel is a common material used in paper machines.\n\n\n\n"}

This was due to the government instructing Ontario Power Generation to stop participating in projects which use more environmentally acceptable generations systems, such as co-generation. Originally, the plant was described as two identical 275 MW power train systems, each comprising a 175 MW GE 7FA gas turbine generator, and other equipment. This proposed configuration was capable of producing over 272,000 kilograms per hour of steam for district heating. This design would, according to a PEC newsletter, allow for the efficiency of the plant to be “about 55% compared to 35% for a typical fossil power plant” There were also plans to include “Canada’s largest solar array” capable of producing “hundreds of kilowatts” though no actual specification seems to have ever been given.\n\nThe original design met with some community resistance and many local residents, all local politicians and a number of significant City of Toronto departments including the Works Department and the Board of Health. These groups called for a full Environmental Assessment (EA) as a way to resolve some of the technical and health related issues with the plant. The Ontario Liberal Government denied a full EA. Over time, the plan was altered significantly in a way that reduced the efficiency and aesthetic virtues of the plant. In November 2004, the proponents hosted a meeting to tell the community that the generation of steam for district heating was no longer going to happen and that the solar panels were no longer going to be included. It was also noted that the attempts to make the exterior of the plant aesthetically pleasing had been dropped in favour of a shed type design.\n\nThe plant was met with considerable local opposition, since it was to be sited on the Waterfront, which is currently undergoing a revitalization process, and has been striving to be a “world leader in sustainable design” (according to the Corporation Chair, Robert Fung). The Ontario Liberal Government decided that, despite significant opposition, the project would be allowed to move forward without a full Environmental Assessment. The Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation played a more neutral role, offering criticism of the plant but falling short of calling for a change of plans.\n\nOn September 18, 2006, TransCanada issued a press release announcing that Portlands Energy Centre L.P. had signed a 20-year Accelerated Clean Energy Supply (ACES) contract with the Ontario Power Authority for the power output of the PEC.\n\nThe plant started delivering 340 MW of power to the City of Toronto in June 2008 in single-cycle operation and was fully operational with an output of 550 MW by the second-quarter 2009. Total capital costs are expected to reach $730MM.\n\n\n"}

The custom duty would allow the Monarch of the Kingdom to collect money that would then be spent to develop and maintain the naval force that protects the Kingdom. \n\nPoundage was closely associated with \"tonnage\", or \"tunnage\", which was a duty on every tun of wine imported.\n\nThe levy was introduced in 1347 under Edward II of England and was then granted by the Parliament in 1373. It continued for many years at the same rate until after the Restoration ((in 1660, when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under King Charles II) from when the Parliament set the rates according to current needs.\n\nMoreover, the Parliament voted in 1414, under Henri V of England, the right for life for every successive monarch to benefit of a royal collection on the ton and pound on imports. \nUnder the reign of Charles I of England (1600-1649), the House of Commons voted a limitation of the royal collection to a period of one year (while the period was for life for the previous monarchs). Charles continued to collect the customs duties, even if no Parliament act was established. \n\nIn January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. \n\nMembers of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies in light of the case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. \n\nOn March 2, 1629, Charles I ordered a parliamentary adjournment, but when the parliament’s speaker, Sir John Finch, was held by members of the Parliament in his chair in order to delay the end of the session, Charles decided to dissolve the Parliament. Sir John Finch as well as nine members of the Parliament were imprisoned. \n\nIn September 1640, following the Bishops' Wars, King Charles I issued writs summoning the Parliament to convene on 3 November 1640. It was the creation of the Long Parliament, that lasted until it voted its own dissolution on the 16 March 1660. \n\nIn 1641, the Tonnage and Poundage Act was voted by the Long Parliament, that would regulate all the taxes in force within the kingdom, concerning consequently the current poundage imposed on imports and exports. \nUnder the reign of Charles II of England (1660-1685), the Convention Parliament (25 April 1660 – 29 December 1660) was founded and followed the Long Parliament that was dissolved on 16 March 1660.\n\nThe Convention Parliament, that only has been existing for eight months, established back the right for life to collect the poundage to the monarch of England. \n\nFrom 1660, the successive monarchs of the Kingdom of England are able to collect once again the poundage. \n\nThe Customs Consolidation Act of 1787 replaced all the customs duties, which was including poundage, by a system where individual tariffs would be applied to importations. \n\nThe act is divided in two mains parts. A first part that includes a statement related to the regulation of all the customs duties. A second part that is listing tables of duty and drawback amounts for all types of products. \n\nA list comprising all importations and tariffs related to each import was consequently put in place. \n\nIn Britain, and elsewhere, the term \"poundage\" is used for the charge imposed on the sale of a postal order.\n\nA postal order is a financial instrument usually intended for sending money through the mail. It is purchased at a post office and is payable at another post office to the named recipient.\n\nThe poundage represents the small fee for the service that is paid by the purchaser.    \n\n"}

It is the only educational and professional academy exclusively dedicated to retail banking anywhere in the world.\nThe RBA is the only international, educational and professional body that's exclusively dedicated to retail banking. \n\nThe Certified Retail Banker (CRB) programme makes it possible for retail bankers to embark on a structured certification programme that covers every aspect of the industry end to end. \n. The Retail Banking Academy has its headquarters in London, UK.\n\nThe organisation was founded in London, UK in 2011 as the \"International Academy of Retail Banking\" with the objective of educating retail bankers worldwide to a high professional standard.\n\nIt believes that a separated, independent retail banking sector should be led by professionally qualified retail bankers, bound by an ethical code similar to those already in place for accountants and lawyers. This ethical code is intended to oblige retail bankers to act in the customer’s best interests. Bankers who persistently fail to comply would be barred from membership of the profession. To that end, the RBA believes that the foundation stone for a retail banking profession must be the complete separation of retail banking from both investment banking and large-scale corporate banking.\n\nIn 2012 the UK Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards accepted evidence from a number of participants operating in the banking sector. The Retail Banking Academy was one of the participants, and its submission was included in selected submissions in its final published report, Changing Banking for Good, which outlines the radical reform required to improve standards across the banking industry.\n\nIn October 2014, the organisation changed its name from the International Academy of Retail Banking to the Retail Banking Academy.\n\nThe RBA offers a large variety of programmes such as:\n\nThe \"Certified Retail Banker programme\" was designed by senior retail bankers and academics from around the world. Since 2011 the qualification strategy has evolved to grow with sector demands, for example, it was made available in the French language in 2012.\nTo become a Certified Retail Banker, and to be able to use the designation CRB, you need to join RBA Membership and successfully pass examinations at three separate levels.\n\n\nRetail Banking I was designed to introduce candidates to the theoretical and practical core competencies that are required for success within a retail banking organisation. It is ideal for retail bankers looking to broaden their scope and banking knowledge. \n\n\nRetail Banking II focuses on the issues that are encountered when leading people and retail banking departments. The course is ideal for retail bankers looking to fast track their career and understand the key divisions/functions of a retail bank.\n\n\nRetail Banking III focuses on developing and enhancing the capabilities required to run retail banking strategic business units. The course is ideal for retail bankers looking to understand how different functions are brought together in one retail bank, and challenges associated to leadership.\n\nThe \"Accelerated Programmes\" have been created for experienced retail bankers with over 10 or 15 years experience, , which means that eligible candidates will be exempt from Retail Banking I exams (Accelerated 10) or exempt from Retail Banking I & II (Accelerated 15) due to their extensive number of years working full-time in the sector. \nand renowned industry speakers are invited to lead thought-leadership discussion groups.\n\nThe \"Certified Cards and Payments Programme\" was launched in 2013 as a result of the introduction of an increasing number of new card payment methods to the market. CCPP certification is gained in the same way as the CRB certification above, with three levels of study and exams to pass. At that point in time, the programme was delivered as an in-bank classroom programme only. \n\nOn the back of the success of the in-bank sessions, there are now first and second levels of the programme available for individual candidates to enrol on our site:\n\n\nCards and Payments I is a specialised programme that provides a broad overview and coverage of the entire lifecycle of all types of payments cards, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, corporate cards and mobile payments.\nThe course is ideal for cards and payments professionals looking to broaden their scope and knowledge in the cards industry. As a functional specialist you will gain an excellent understanding of other areas along with a strategic grasp of the industry which embraces international trends and best practices.\n\n\nCards and Payments II is a specialised programme focussed on the key areas of the Cards and Payments industry. The course is ideal for cards and payments professionals looking to broaden their scope and knowledge in the cards industry.\n\nFor senior retail bankers with over 15 years of experience, the RBA also offers the Executive Management Programme that is hosted twice per year in London or Johannesburg. It's a three or five-day immersive programme for senior delegates, where a group our distinguished faculty deliver lectures, facilitate practical workshops\n\nThe Retail Banking Academy offers access to the CRB qualification via eLearning with a series of interactive modules and analytics solutions that continuously adapts to the candidates’ performance, facilitates critical reasoning and provides continuous coaching and feedback to help you become proficient at the core curriculum and enhance your retail banking training. \n\nProgrammes can also be tailored specifically to meet the needs of individual bank requirements, strategy and objectives with the in-bank programmes. Not only programmes can be bespoke, but can also be delivered by faculty staff in a classroom setting or via the e-learning platform, or in fact a combination of both types of learning.\n\nThe Retail Banking Academy is governed by a board of directors, an academic standards board, an awarding organisation and its governing body. The board of directors is chaired by Michael Lafferty (chairman of Lafferty Group and a former Financial Times journalist). The academic director is Professor Abdul Rahman, a former full professor of economics and finance and Telfer teaching Fellow at the Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa.\n"}

Upon the early death of his father, he began a commercial apprenticeship. As director of Ruinart, one of the leading champagne houses in Reims, France, he was experienced with the \"méthode champenoise\" when he on an 1841 boat trip met his future wife Sophie Kirchner from Vienna, the daughter of a wealthy factory owner. He had the idea to produce champagne-like wine (\"Schaumwein\") in Austria using the French method but Austrian grapes.\n\nIn 1842, Schlumberger founded his company renting several vineyards in Vöslau, a small Lower Austrian town south of Vienna situated in the present-day \"Thermenregion\" wine-growing area of the eastern Vienna Woods. His alliance which Sophie Kirchner, whom he married in the following year, helped him finance his business venture. Schlumberger presented his first sparkling wine in 1846 under the name \"Vöslauer weißer Schaumwein\" (White sparkling wine of Vöslau), from 1859 under \"Vöslauer Goldeck\", the first protected wine trademark in Austria. It was produced from red Blauer Portugieser grapes growing in the Goldeck vineyards in Vöslau, which Schlumberger bought in 1843, and the sparkling wine was an immediate success.\n\nSchlumberger wines were on board of the SMS Novara on its around-the-world mission 1857-59. The company opened branch stores in Berlin and after the 1862 International Exhibition also in London, where the wine was sold under the brand name \"Vöslauer Sparkling\". Robert Schlumberger also served as Vöslau mayor from 1864 to 1870. In 1878, one year before his death, he was ennobled by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria as \"Edler von Goldeck\". He died in Vöslau, aged 64.\nRobert Schlumberger's son and heir Otto received the title of a \"K.u.k. Hoflieferant\" in 1895. The company survived the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1918 and up to today, Schlumberger Wein- und Sektkellerei GmbH with its seat at Vienna-Döbling is one of the leading producers of sparkling wine in Austria.

Levine\n\nSolomon Bernard Levine(August 10, 1920 - October 3, 2006) was one of the U.S.'s foremost experts on Japanese labor and industrial relations.\n\nLevine's book \"Industrial Relations in Postwar Japan\", published in 1958, was considered to be a landmark in the field, influencing a generation of Asian scholars. His deep knowledge and interest in Japan came long before the 1980s explosion in interest and writing about the rapid growth and success of the Japanese economy and employment system. Levine’s book then became the classic reference that everyone working on these topics were told to read.\n\nLevine was a naval intelligence officer in World War II and learned to speak Japanese as part of the war effort. While in the language program, he met his wife, Betty, also a naval intelligence officer. Levine was part of the Okinawa landing and, later, the occupation of Japan. While serving in the occupation, Levine developed a fascination with Japanese culture that was to last the rest of his life. Still in Naval intelligence, he served as a translator for a Japanese admiral who had helped design the battleship \"Yamato\".\n\nAfter the service, Levine received a BA and MBA from Harvard and a Phd. in Economics from MIT. He was then hired as an assistant professor at the University of Illinois and began to do research on Japanese labor relations. His department head warned, \"no one would ever be interested in\" his chosen field. Eventually, Levine became the Director of the Asian Studies Center at the Univ. of Illinois and, later, Chairman of the East Asian Studies program and professor of industrial relations and international business at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.\n\nAlthough widely respected, Levine's work often ran counter to accepted truisms on the subject. For example, Japan's postwar boom was often attributed to an extraordinarily loyal and docile workforce. Levine showed that Japanese workers in the 1950s were actually just as likely to strike as American ones. And he contended that the supposed cradle-to-grave job security offered by Japanese corporations was a myth, long before the economic decline of the 90s demonstrated this on a widespread basis. He noted, correctly, that life-time security was afforded at best one third of the male labor force. It did not extend to those working outside of large firms in smaller manufacturing supplier firms, those over the age of 55, women, and those in the service sector.\n\nLevine’s work was widely acclaimed by other Japanese and international scholars and experts for its rich understanding of the Japanese culture, institutions, and history. He attracted to the University of Illinois, and then to the University of Wisconsin, many Japanese students who went on to take up faculty positions in leading Japanese universities and to become top advisors of Japanese government leaders. Much of this came from the time he and his wife lived and studied in Japan and from the knowledge he gained from the wide array of Japanese scholars, students, and professionals with whom he interacted. Noted industrial relations expert, Thomas Anton Kochan, wrote, “Unlike much of the more superficial writing about the Japanese ‘model’ of labor and employment relations that appeared during the peak of its success and popularity, Levine’s work and depiction of industrial relations in Japan has stood the test of time well.\"\n\nIndustrial Relations in Postwar Japan by Solomon B.

He added that the dialogues lacked credibility, and that there is a \"lack of an adult, emotionally mature perspective\". \n\nWriting for \"The New York Observer\", Matthew Kassel argued that it \"read[s] like a cross between \"Jane Eyre\" and \"Running with Scissors\", adding that \"it contain[ed] more than a few unsavory details about her family, personal things that one might not want the public to know about.\" He went on to say that \"the book feels like a child's revenge on her family.\" \n\nIn \"Salon\", Laura Miller called it \"a mournful, curious tale of an anxious child's longing for security.\" She added that it lacked \"the fluency of truly accomplished storytelling\". \n\nIn \"The Boston Globe\", Buzzy Jackson, the author of \"Shaking the Family Tree: Blue Bloods, Black Sheep, and Other Obsessions of an Accidental Genealogist\", argued that it was \"unpleasant for the reader to spend time with these spoiled, deranged people.\" \n\nIn the \"Star Tribune\", Eric Hanson called the book, \"wearying, gorgeous, ugly, sad, bohemian and only mildly sordid or scandalous by TV or literary standards.\"\n"}

The company is based in New York City.\n\nTrello was released at a TechCrunch event by Fog Creek founder Joel Spolsky. \"Wired\" magazine named the application in September 2011 one of \"The 7 Coolest Startups You Haven't Heard of Yet\". Lifehacker said \"it makes project collaboration simple and kind of enjoyable\".\n\nIn 2014, it raised $10.3 million in funding from Index Ventures and Spark Capital.\n\nIn 2015, Trello launched third-party integrations with tools such as Slack, GitHub and Salesforce for its paying users. In 2016, Trello opened this platform to additional developers with the launch of its \"Power-Ups Platform\" for developers wanting to integrate their services with Trello.\n\nIn May 2016, Trello claimed it had more than 1.1 million daily active users and 14 million total signups.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, Atlassian announced its intent to acquire Trello for $425 million. The transaction was made with $360 million in cash, while the remaining $65 million was made with shares and options. Trello had earlier sold 22% of its shares to other investors with the remaining majority held by founders Michael Pryor and Joel Spolsky at the time of acquisition.\n\nTrello has a variety of work and personal uses including real estate management, software project management, school bulletin boards, lesson planning, accounting, web design, gaming and law office case management.

{"id": "16597487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16597487", "title": "Wells Fargo", "text": "Wells Fargo\n\nWells Fargo & Company is an American multinational financial services company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with central offices throughout the United States. It is the world's second-largest bank by market capitalization and the fourth largest bank in the US by total assets. Wells Fargo is ranked #26 on the 2018 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest US corporations by total revenue. In July 2015, Wells Fargo became the world's largest bank by market capitalization, edging past ICBC, before slipping behind JPMorgan Chase in September 2016, in the wake of a scandal involving the creation of over 2 million fake bank accounts by Wells Fargo employees. Wells Fargo surpassed Citigroup to become the third-largest US bank by assets at the end of 2015 but fell behind Bank of America to third in bank deposits in 2017.\n\nThe firm's primary operating subsidiary is national bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco–based Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls. Along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, Wells Fargo is one of the \"Big Four Banks\" of the United States. , it had 8,050 branches and 13,000 ATMs. In 2018 the company had operations in 35 countries with over 70 million customers globally.\n\nIn February 2014, Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the second consecutive year in \"The Banker\" and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands. In 2016, Wells Fargo ranked 7th on the Forbes Magazine Global 2000 list of largest public companies in the world and ranked 27th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the US. In 2015, the company was ranked the 22nd most admired company in the world, and the 7th most respected company in the world. , the company had a Standard & Poors credit rating of A−. However, for a brief period in 2007, the company was the only AAA‑rated bank, reflecting the highest credit rating from two firms. \n\nOn February 2, 2018, the US Federal Reserve Bank barred Wells Fargo from growing its nearly US$2 trillion-asset base any further, based upon years of misconduct, until Wells Fargo fixes its internal problems to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve. In April 2018, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that the US Department of Labor had launched a probe into whether Wells Fargo was pushing its customers into more expensive retirement plans as well as into retirement funds managed by Wells Fargo itself. Subsequently in May 2018, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Wells Fargo's business banking group had improperly altered documents about business clients in 2017 and early 2018. In June 2018, Wells Fargo began retreating from retail banking in the Midwestern United States by announcing the sale of all its physical bank branch locations in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio to Flagstar Bank.\n\nThe company operates 12 museums, most known as a Wells Fargo History Museum, in its corporate buildings in Charlotte, North Carolina, Denver, Colorado, Des Moines, Iowa, Los Angeles, California, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Phoenix, Arizona, Portland, Oregon, Sacramento, California and San Francisco, California. Displays include original stagecoaches, photographs, gold nuggets and mining artifacts, the Pony Express, telegraph equipment and historic bank artifacts. The company also operates a museum about company history in the Pony Express Terminal in Old Sacramento State Historic Park in Sacramento, California, which was the company's second office, and the Wells Fargo History Museum in Old Town San Diego State Historic Park in San Diego, California.\nWells Fargo operates the Alaska Heritage Museum in Anchorage, Alaska, which features a large collection of Alaskan Native artifacts, ivory carvings and baskets, fine art by Alaskan artists, and displays about Wells Fargo history in the Alaskan Gold Rush era.\n\n \n\n\nOn October 3, 2008, Wachovia agreed to be bought by Wells Fargo for about US$14.8 billion in an all-stock transaction. This news came four days after the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) made moves to have Citigroup buy Wachovia for US$2.1 billion. Citigroup protested Wachovia's agreement to sell itself to Wells Fargo and threatened legal action over the matter. However, the deal with Wells Fargo overwhelmingly won shareholder approval since it valued Wachovia at about seven times what Citigroup offered. To further ensure shareholder approval, Wachovia issued Wells Fargo preferred stock that holds 39.9% of the voting power in the company.\n\nOn October 4, 2008, a New York state judge issued a temporary injunction blocking the transaction from going forward while the situation was sorted out. Citigroup alleged that they had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia that barred Wachovia from negotiating with other potential buyers. The injunction was overturned late in the evening on October 5, 2008, by New York state appeals court. Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. Those negotiations failed. Sources say that Citigroup was unwilling to take on more risk than the US$42 billion that would have been the cap under the previous FDIC-backed deal (with the FDIC incurring all losses over US$42 billion). Citigroup did not block the merger, but indicated they would seek damages of US$60 billion for breach of an alleged exclusivity agreement with Wachovia.\n\nOn October 28, 2008, Wells Fargo was the recipient of US$25 billion of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act funds in the form of a preferred stock purchase by the US Treasury Department. Tests by the US Federal Government revealed that Wells Fargo needed an additional US$13.7 billion in order to remain well capitalized if the economy were to deteriorate further under stress test scenarios. On May 11, 2009, Wells Fargo announced an additional stock offering which was completed on May 13, 2009, raising US$8.6 billion in capital. The remaining US$4.9 billion in capital was planned to be raised through earnings. On Dec. 23, 2009, Wells Fargo redeemed the US$25 billion of preferred stock issued to the US Treasury. As part of the redemption of the preferred stock, Wells Fargo also paid accrued dividends of US$131.9 million, bringing the total dividends paid to US$1.441 billion since the preferred stock was issued in October 2008.\n\nWells Fargo Securities was established in 2009 to house Wells Fargo's capital markets group which it obtained during the Wachovia acquisition. Prior to that point, Wells Fargo had little to no participation in investment banking activities, though Wachovia had a well established investment banking practice which it operated under the Wachovia Securities banner.\n\nWachovia's institutional capital markets and investment banking business arose from the merger of Wachovia and First Union. First Union had bought Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co. on April 30, 1998 adding to its merger and acquisition, high yield, leveraged finance, equity underwriting, private placement, loan syndication, risk management, and public finance capabilities.\n\nLegacy components of Wells Fargo Securities include Wachovia Securities, Bowles Hollowell Connor & Co., Barrington Associates, Halsey, Stuart & Co., Leopold Cahn & Co., Bache & Co.. Prudential Securities, A.G. Edwards, Inc. and the investment banking arm of Citadel LLC.\n\nIn 2009, Wells Fargo ranked #1 among banks and insurance companies, and #13 overall, in Newsweek Magazine’s inaugural \"Green Rankings\" of the country’s 500 largest companies. In 2013, the company was recognized by the EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership as a Climate Leadership Award winner, in the category \"Excellence in Greenhouse Gas Management (Goal Setting Certificate)\"; this recognition was for the company's aim to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its US operations by 35% by 2020 versus 2008 levels.\n\n, Wells Fargo had provided more than in financing for environmentally beneficial business opportunities, including supporting 185 commercial-scale solar photovoltaic projects and 27 utility-scale wind projects nationwide.\n\nWells Fargo has launched what it believes to be the first blog among its industry peers to report on its environmental stewardship and to solicit feedback and ideas from its stakeholders.\n\nWells Fargo delineates three different business segments when reporting results: Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement.\n\nThe Community Banking segment includes Regional Banking, Diversified Products, and Consumer Deposits groups, as well as Wells Fargo Customer Connection (formerly Wells Fargo Phone Bank, Wachovia Direct Access, the National Business Banking Center, and Credit Card Customer Service). Wells Fargo also has around 2,000 stand-alone mortgage branches throughout the country. There are mini-branches located inside of other buildings, which are almost exclusively grocery stores, that usually contain ATMs, basic teller services, and, space permitting, an office for private meetings with customers. In March 2017, Wells Fargo announced a plan to offer smartphone-based transactions with mobile wallets including Wells Fargo Wallet, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.\n\nAs of Q3 2011, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage was the largest retail mortgage lender in the United States, originating one out of every four home loans. Wells Fargo services US$1.8 trillion in home mortgages, the second largest servicing portfolio in the US It was reported in 2012 Wells Fargo reached 30% market share for US mortgages, however, the then-CEO John Stumpf had said the numbers were misleading because about half of that share represented the aggregation of smaller loans that were then sold on in the secondary market. In 2013, its share was closer to 22%; of which eight percentage points was aggregation.\n\nWells Fargo private student loans are available to students to pay for college expenses, such as tuition, books, computers, or housing. Loans are available for undergraduate, career and community colleges, graduate school, law school and medical school. Wells Fargo also provides private student loan consolidation and student loans for parents.\n\nWells Fargo has various divisions that finance and lease equipment to different types of companies. One venture is Wells Fargo Rail, which in 2015 agreed to the purchase of GE Capital Rail Services and merged in with First Union Rail. In late 2015, it was announced that Wells Fargo would buy three GE units focused on business loans equipment financing. \n\nWells Fargo offers investment products through its subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Investments, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC, as well as through national broker/dealer firms. Mutual funds are offered under the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds brand name. The company also serves high-net-worth individuals through its private bank and family wealth group.\n\nWells Fargo Advisors is the brokerage subsidiary of Wells Fargo, located in St. Louis, Missouri. It is the third largest brokerage firm in the United States as of the third quarter of 2010 with US$1.1 trillion retail client assets under management.\n\nWells Fargo Advisors was known as Wachovia Securities until May 1, 2009, when it legally changed names following the Wells Fargo's acquisition of Wachovia Corporation.\n\nIn September 2018, Wells Fargo announced to cut 26,450 jobs by 2020 to reduce costs by US$4 billion.\n\nWells Fargo Securities (WFS) is the investment banking division of Wells Fargo & Co. The size and financial performance of this group is not disclosed publicly, but analysts believe the investment banking group houses approximately 4,500 employees and generates between US$3 and US$4 billion per year in investment banking revenue. By comparison, two of Wells Fargo’s largest competitors, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase generated approximately US$5.5 billion and US$6 billion respectively in 2011 (not including sales and trading revenue). WFS headquarters are in Charlotte, North Carolina, with other US offices in New York, Minneapolis, Boston, Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, with international offices in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo.\n\nA key part of Wells Fargo's business strategy is cross-selling, the practice of encouraging existing customers to buy additional banking products. Customers inquiring about their checking account balance may be pitched mortgage deals and mortgage holders may be pitched credit card offers in an attempt to increase the customer's profitability to the bank. Other banks have attempted to emulate Wells Fargo's cross-selling practices (described by \"The Wall Street Journal\" as a hard sell technique); \"Forbes\" magazine describes Wells Fargo as \"better than anyone\" at the practice.\n\nWells Fargo has banking services throughout the world, with offices in Hong Kong, London, Dubai, Singapore, Tokyo, Toronto. They operate back-offices in India and the Philippines with more than 3,000 staff.\n\nWells Fargo operates under Charter #1, the first national bank charter issued in the United States. This charter was issued to First National Bank of Philadelphia on June 20, 1863, by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Traditionally, acquiring banks assume the earliest issued charter number. Thus, the first charter passed from First National Bank of Philadelphia to Wells Fargo through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, which had inherited it through one of its many acquisitions.\n\nIn 1981, it was discovered that a Wells Fargo assistant operations officer, Lloyd Benjamin \"Ben\" Lewis, had perpetrated one of the largest embezzlements in history, through its Beverly Drive branch. During 1978 - 1981, Lewis had successfully written phony debit and credit receipts to benefit boxing promoters Harold J. Smith (né Ross Eugene Fields) and Sam \"Sammie\" Marshall, chairman and president, respectively, of Muhammed Ali Professional Sports, Inc. (MAPS), of which Lewis was also listed as a director; Marshall, too, was a former employee of the same Wells Fargo branch as Lewis. In excess of US$300,000 was paid to Lewis, who pled guilty to embezzlement and conspiracy charges in 1981, and testified against his co-conspirators for a reduced five-year sentence. (Boxer Muhammed Ali had received a fee for the use of his name, and had no other involvement with the organization.)\n\nIllinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed suit against Wells Fargo on July 31, 2009, alleging that the bank steers African Americans and Hispanics into high-cost subprime loans. A Wells Fargo spokesman responded that \"The policies, systems, and controls we have in place – including in Illinois – ensure race is not a factor...\" An affidavit filed in the case stated that loan officers had referred to black mortgage-seekers as \"mud people,\" and the subprime loans as \"ghetto loans.\" According to Beth Jacobson, a loan officer at Wells Fargo interviewed for a report in \"The New York Times\", \"We just went right after them. Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches, because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans.\" The report goes on to present data from the city of Baltimore, where \"more than half the properties subject to foreclosure on a Wells Fargo loan from 2005 to 2008 now stand vacant. And 71 percent of those are in predominantly black neighborhoods.\" Wells Fargo agreed to pay US$125 million to subprime borrowers and US$50 million in direct down payment assistance in certain areas, for a total of US$175 million.\n\nIn a March 2010 agreement with US federal prosecutors, Wells Fargo acknowledged that between 2004 and 2007 Wachovia had failed to monitor and report suspected money laundering by narcotics traffickers, including the cash used to buy four planes that shipped a total of 22 tons of cocaine into Mexico.\n\nIn August 2010, Wells Fargo was fined by US District Court judge William Alsup for overdraft practices designed to \"gouge\" consumers and \"profiteer\" at their expense, and for misleading consumers about how the bank processed transactions and assessed overdraft fees.\n\nOn February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally Financial, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a settlement with the US Federal Government and 49 states. The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about US$26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the federal and state governments. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in US history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The five banks were also required to comply with 305 new mortgage servicing standards. Oklahoma held out and agreed to settle with the banks separately.\n\nOn April 5, 2012, a federal judge ordered Wells Fargo to pay US$3.1 million in punitive damages over a single loan, one of the largest fines for a bank ever for mortgaging service misconduct. Elizabeth Magner, a federal bankruptcy judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana, cited the bank's behavior as \"highly reprehensible\", stating that Wells Fargo has taken advantage of borrowers who rely on the bank's accurate calculations. She went on to add, \"perhaps more disturbing is Wells Fargo's refusal to voluntarily correct its errors. It prefers to rely on the ignorance of borrowers or their inability to fund a challenge to its demands, rather than voluntarily relinquish gains obtained through improper accounting methods.\"\n\nOn August 14, 2012, Wells Fargo agreed to pay around US$6.5 million to settle US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges that in 2007 it sold risky mortgage-backed securities without fully realizing their dangers.\n\nOn October 9, 2012, the US Federal Government sued the bank under the False Claims Act at the federal court in Manhattan, New York. The suit alleges that Wells Fargo defrauded the US Federal Housing Administration (FHA) over the past ten years, underwriting over 100,000 FHA backed loans when over half did not qualify for the program. This suit is the third allegation levied against Wells Fargo in 2012.\n\nIn October 2012, Wells Fargo was sued by United States Attorney Preet Bharara over questionable mortgage deals.\n\nIn April 2013, Wells Fargo settled a suit with 24,000 Florida homeowners alongside insurer QBE, in which Wells Fargo was accused of inflating premiums on forced-place insurance.\n\nIn May 2013, Wells Fargo paid US$203 million to settle class-action litigation accusing the bank of imposing excessive overdraft fees on checking-account customers. Also in May, the New York attorney-general, Eric Schneiderman, announced a lawsuit against Wells Fargo over alleged violations of the national mortgage settlement, a US$25 billion deal struck between 49 state attorneys and the five-largest mortgage servicers in the US. Schneidermann claimed Wells Fargo had violated rules over giving fair and timely serving.\n\nIn February 2015, Wells Fargo agreed to pay US$4 million for violations where an affiliate took interest in the homes of borrowers in exchange for opening credit card accounts for the homeowners. This is illegal according to New York credit card laws. There was a US$2 million penalty with the other US$2 million going towards restitution to customers.\n\nWith CEO John Stumpf being paid 473 times more than the median employee, Wells Fargo ranks number 33 among the S&P 500 companies for CEO—employee pay inequality. In October 2014, a Wells Fargo employee earning US$15 per hour emailed the CEO—copying 200,000 other employees—asking that all employees be given a US$10,000 per year raise taken from a portion of annual corporate profits to address wage stagnation and income inequality. After being contacted by the media, Wells Fargo responded that all employees receive \"market competitive\" pay and benefits significantly above US federal minimums.\n\nIn December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized Wells Fargo for spending US$11 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting US$681 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of US$49 billion, laying off 6,385 workers since 2008, and increasing executive pay by 180% to US$49.8 million in 2010 for its top five executives. As of 2014 however, at an effective tax rate of 31.2% of its income, Wells Fargo is the fourth-largest payer of corporation tax in the US.\n\nThe GEO Group, Inc., a multi-national provider of for-profit private prisons, received investments made by Wells Fargo mutual funds on behalf of clients, not investments made by Wells Fargo and Company, according to company statements. By March 2012, its stake had grown to more than 4.4 million shares worth US$86.7 million. As of November, 2012, the latest SEC filings reveal that Wells Fargo has divested 33% of its dispositive holdings of GEO's stock, which reduces Wells Fargo's holdings to 4.98% of Geo Group's common stock. By reducing its holdings to less than 5%, Wells Fargo will no longer be required to disclose some financial dealings with GEO.\n\nWhile a coalition of organizations, National People's Action Campaign, have seen some success in pressuring Wells Fargo to divest from private prison companies like GEO Group, the company continues to make such investments.\n\nIn 2015, an analyst at Wells Fargo settled an insider trading case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The former employee was charged with insider trading alongside an ex-Wells Fargo trader. Sadis & Goldberg obtained a settlement that permitted the client to continue in securities industry, while neither admitting nor denying one charge of negligence-based § 17(a)(3) claim, and paying a US$75,000 civil penalty\n\nIn September 2016, Wells Fargo was issued a combined total of US$185 million in fines for creating over 1.5 million checking and savings accounts and 500,000 credit cards that its customers never authorized. The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued US$100 million in fines, the largest in the agency's five-year history, along with US$50 million in fines from the City and County of Los Angeles, and US$35 million in fines from the Office of Comptroller of the Currency. The scandal was caused by an incentive-compensation program for employees to create new accounts. It led to the firing of nearly 5,300 employees and US$5 million being set aside for customer refunds on fees for accounts the customers never wanted. Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the department, retired in July 2016 and received US$124.6 million in stock, options, and restricted Wells Fargo shares as a retirement package. On October 12, 2016, John Stumpf, the then Chairman and CEO, announced that he would be retiring amidst the controversies involving his company. It was announced by Wells Fargo that President and Chief Operating Officer Timothy J. Sloan would succeed, effective immediately. Following the scandal, applications for credit cards and checking accounts at the bank plummeted dramatically. In response to the event, the Better Business Bureau dropped accreditation of the bank, S&P Global Ratings lowered its outlook for Wells Fargo to negative from stable, and several states and cities across the US ended business relations with the company. An investigation by the Wells Fargo board of directors, the report of which was released in April 2017, primarily blamed Stumpf, whom it said had not responded to evidence of wrongdoing in the consumer services division, and Tolstedt, who was said to have knowingly set impossible sales goals and refused to respond when subordinates disagreed with them. The board chose to use a clawback clause in the retirement contracts of Stumpf and Tolstedt to recover US$75 million worth of cash and stock from the former executives.\n\nIn November 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay US$50 million to settle a racketeering lawsuit in which the bank was accused of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for appraisals ordered after they defaulted on their mortgage loans. While banks are allowed to charge homeowners for such appraisals, Wells Fargo frequently charged homeowners US$95 to US$125 on appraisals for which the bank had been charged US$50 or less. The plaintiffs had sought triple damages under the U S Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act on grounds that sending invoices and statements with fraudulently concealed fees constituted mail and wire fraud sufficient to allege racketeering.\n\nWells Fargo is a top investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline project in North Dakota, a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground oil pipeline project in the United States. The pipeline has been controversial regarding its necessity, and potential impact on the environment.\n\nIn February 2017, Seattle, Washington's city council unanimously voted to not renew its contract with Wells Fargo \"in a move that cites the bank's role as a lender to the Dakota Access Pipeline project as well as its \"creation of millions of bogus accounts.\" and saying the bidding process for its next banking partner will involve \"social responsibility.\" The City Council in Davis, California, took a similar action voting unanimously to find a new bank to handle its accounts by the end of 2017.\n\nIn December 2016, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Wells Fargo US$5.5 million for failing to store electronic documents in a \"write once, read many\" format, which makes it impossible to alter or destroy records after they are written.\n\nOn May 6, 2018, Wells Fargo launched an integrated marketing campaign called \"Re-Established\" to emphasize the company's commitment to re-establish trust with stakeholders and to demonstrate how Wells Fargo is transforming as it emerges from a challenging period in its history. The television commercial opens with the bank's origins in the Old West, references the scandal and fast-forwards to depict dedicated bank employees and happy customers as a narrator assures viewers: \"It's a new day at Wells Fargo\".\n\nWells Fargo is the top banker for US gun makers and the National Rifle Association (NRA). From December 2012 through February 2018 it reportedly helped two of the biggest firearms and ammunition companies obtain US$431.1 million in loans and bonds. It also created a US$28-million line of credit for the NRA and operates the organization’s primary accounts.\n\nIn a March 2018 statement Wells Fargo said, \"Any solutions on how to address this epidemic will be complicated. This is why our company believes the best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process. ... We plan to engage our customers that legally manufacture firearms and other stakeholders on what we can do together to promote better gun safety for our communities.” Wells Fargo’s CEO subsequently said that the bank would provide its gun clients with feedback from employees and investors.\n\nIn June 2018, about a dozen female Wells Fargo executives from the wealth management division met in Scottsdale, Arizona to discuss the minimal presence of women occupying senior roles within the company. The meeting, dubbed \"the meeting of 12\", represented the majority of the regional managing directors, of which 12 out of 45 are women. Wells Fargo had previously been investigating reports of gender bias in the division in the months leading up to the meeting. The women reported that they had been turned down for top jobs despite their qualifications, and instead the roles were occupied by men. There were also complaints against company president Jay Welker, who is also the head of the Wells Fargo wealth management division, due to his sexist statements regarding female employees. The female workers claimed that he called them \"girls\" and said that they \"should be at home taking care of their children.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The company also initiated a line of Opera productions, Musicals, theater shows and sport events. The most prominent of them were The Bolshoy Theater, 42nd Street, Walt Disney’s World on Ice and the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nAmong other things Talit was also responsible for the Night of Love performance which was held in Tzemach, on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, The Magician, a musical based on The Wizard of Oz, which ran since 1994 and had more than 600 shows. During the past few years, Talit has been responsible in a joint production with the Beit Lesin Theater in Israel, for the hit one man show starring Avi Kushnir, Returning the Cave Man.\n\nAt the same time, the company has represented many artists and Israeli performers from Kaveret and Shalom Hanoch to Avi Kushnir and Danny Sanderson.
