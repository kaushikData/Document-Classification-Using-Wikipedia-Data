In the 70's, he became one of the main shareholders of Ocasa, and at the end of President Raúl Alfonsín's term he began to operate airport security in Ezeiza.\n\nHis name became known due to allegations of former economy minister Domingo Cavallo. At a session of the Congress in 1995, the then finance minister denounced Yabrán as a kind of mafia boss with political and judicial protection. Yabrán, currently known by the general public, was largely unknown at the time and the press did not have any pictures of him.\n\nLegally, Yabrán only declared a few companies, but Cavallo accused him of driving, through proxies, other major companies. Among them, Correo OCA (which handled 30% of the Argentine postal market), Ocasa (which Yabrán claimed to have sold ), Ciccone Calcográfica (a print and minting company that printed the Patacones Bonaerenses in the 2001 recession) and a transport and logistics company called Villalonga Furlong. These companies were sold to the Exxel Group for $605 million.\n\nThe main accusation against Yabrán was that their transport and security companies were being used to hide drugs, weapons trafficking and money laundering.\n\nAmong other things, he owned the private courier company OCASA, and the immense - of which are covered - EDCADASSA warehouses at the Ezeiza international airport in Buenos Aires.\n\nWhen his name became known due to allegations of former economy minister Domingo Cavallo, Yabrán was extremely secretive and jealous of his privacy. After the murder of photojournalist José Luis Cabezas, who had been investigating Yabrán, he was forced to come out in public and face the suspicions of society.\n\nThe killing of Cabezas embarrassed President Carlos Menem's government while Menem admitted that Emir Yoma was Alfredo Yabrán's friend, he denied that Yabran knew him.\n\nHis former wife Zulema Yoma insisted that they were close friends, and was proven right when it was found out that Yabran had given Menem a mansion in Buenos Aires as a marriage gift.\n\nJustice Minister Elias Jassan had to resign over the 102 calls he personally made to Yabran and because of the calls that he had with Yabran's bodyguards the day after the murder of Cabezas.\n\nCabinet Minister Jorge Rodriguez was criticized for receiving Yabran in the Casa Rosada.\n\nIn 1998, Yabrán was found dead in one of his houses, with a gunshot through his face which left him nearly unrecognizable.\n"}

The state park encompasses surrounding the Ames Mansion, which was built in 1910. The area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Borderland Historic District in 1997. It is operated by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, with an appointed advisory council that participates in policy decision-making.\n\nIn 1906, Oakes Ames, a Harvard botanist (son of Massachusetts governor Oliver Ames and grandson of U.S. Representative Oakes Ames), and his wife Blanche Ames Ames (daughter of Mississippi governor Adelbert Ames, but not related to Oakes Ames), an artist and feminist, purchased land on the border of Sharon and Easton. There they built a mansion which still stands and created a nature preserve with woodland paths and roadways and man-made ponds. The family's home, a three-story, 20-room stone mansion constructed in 1910, was built largely at the direction of Blanche Ames. Her paintings still hang on the walls and much of the original furnishings are still intact. After remaining in the family for sixty-five years, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts acquired the Borderland estate in 1971, two years after the death of Blanche Ames, and opened it as a state park.\n\nThe park has more than of wooded trails for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding. Trails include a portion of the Bay Circuit Trail and the Quarry Loop to Moyles Quarry which supplied the facing stone for the Canton Viaduct in 1835. The park features mansion tours, a visitors center, pond fishing and canoeing, ice skating, sledding, and disc golf.\n\nBorderland is the home course for Oliver Ames High School cross country team. It is also utilized by the Old Colony League for its annual cross country meet, hosts the Hockomock League Championship meet and various invitational meets on the course, and was the site of the World Masters Flying Disc Championships in 1996.\n\nThe park has been used in a commercial, a documentary, and the film \"Mermaids\". Scenes from the Martin Scorsese movie \"Shutter Island\" were shot at the stone lodge next to Leach Pond in 2008. Ames Mansion interiors were used as a filming location for \"Ghostbusters\" in 2016.

{"id": "534617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=534617", "title": "Care Bears", "text": "Care Bears\n\nThe Care Bears are a fictional group of multi-colored bear characters originally painted in 1981 by artist Elena Kucharik to be used on greeting cards from American Greetings, but later used for toys, in TV programs, and in films. There are 218 Care Bears to date. \n\nThe original development was through American Greetings' \"Those Characters From Cleveland\" research and development division, In 1983, Kenner turned the Care Bears into plush teddy bears. The Care Bears appeared in TV specials called \"The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings\" (1983) and \"The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine\" (1984). They then had a television series from 1985 to 1988, and three feature films: \"The Care Bears Movie\" (1985), \"\" (1986) and \"The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland\" (1987).\n\nEach Care Bear comes in a different color and has a specialized insignia on its belly that represents its personality. The movie \"\" named them \"belly badges\". Adding to the Care Bear family are the \"Care Bear Cousins\", which feature a lion, rabbit, penguin, raccoon, monkey, elephant, pig, dog, cat, and other such animals created in the same style as the teddy bears.\n\nIn 2002, the bears were reintroduced with new toys. Made by Play-Along Toys, the new toys offered features such as illuminated bellies upon touch, aerobic bears, and glow-in-the-dark bears. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in two computer-animated movies: \"\" (2004), \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" (2005) and \"The Care Bears' Rise Up Of Kingdom\" (2006). In 2007, the franchise celebrated its 25th anniversary; another relaunch took place, as well as the release of \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\".\n\nIn mid-2011, American Greetings announced a revival TV animated series titled \"\". The premiere of the series utilizes \"30 years of caring\". It premiered on The Hub on June 2, 2012. Though Welcome to Care-a-Lot lasted one season, a continuation of the series, \"Care Bears and Cousins\", was commissioned by Netflix and premiered November 6, 2015. The cast of characters and animation style of Welcome to Care-a-Lot remains for Care Bears and Cousins. Toy company Just Play debuted a range of Care Bears toys (plush, figures & blind bag collectibles) based on the Welcome to Care-a-Lot characters and style guide in Spring 2015. Just Play continued their range of product for Care Bears and Cousins in 2016.\n\nThe Care Bears were initially created in 1981 by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the licensing division of American Greetings. Jack Chojnacki, the co-president of TCFC, introduced the first Care Bear, to six businessmen—three from American Greeting Cards, and three from the toy company Kenner—in February 1981. On the employees' reaction to the toy, Chojnacki recalled in early 1985: \"It had a high aaaaaah factor.\"\n\nMuriel Fahrion, the artist who helped create Strawberry Shortcake's look, was also among the franchise's first concept artists. Working with TCFC Creative VP Ralph Shaffer, Muriel designed the first six bears, creating the best-selling greeting card themes for their belly graphics. Susan Trentel, Muriel's sister and doll designer of Strawberry Shortcake, designed the Care Bears plush. Once out of the concept stage children's book illustrator Elena Kucharik became the primary artist for the Care Bears creating hundreds of full color illustrations for cards, books and a myriad of licensed products. TCFC's creative team of artists and writers worked to create numerous characters in the line, which was a joint development by Those Characters From Cleveland and MAD (Marketing and Design Service of the toy group of General Mills).\n\nAs they had done with Strawberry Shortcake, once titled \"Project I\", American Greeting Cards called the Care Bears development \"Project II\" as they strove to make the character program secret until advertising was ready. At the start of the franchise, Care Bears was already established as its working title.\n\nOn September 24, 1982, the Care Bears franchise was launched in New York City before members of the area's Society of Security Analysts. Attending the event were American Greetings president Morry Weiss, and two employees of Those Characters from Cleveland: Jack Chojnacki and senior vice-president Henry Lowenthal. Eventually, the characters were announced as a toyline for production by Parker Brothers and Kenner the following spring, as well as pre-licensed characters and media stars. At that time, American Greetings touted their debut as \"the biggest character launch in the history of retailing\". On a US$5–6 million advertising budget and a wholesale commitment worth US$122.5 million, American Greetings introduced the characters to the general public in February 1983, with an appearance at New York City's Toy Fair; 26 licensees were involved upon launch. Among them was General Mills, a food company which owned the board game manufacturer Parker Brothers. In early 1983, Parker Brothers released six books featuring the Care Bears as part of its publishing division's first offerings. On television, the original ten Bears starred in their first syndicated special, Atkinson Film-Arts' \"The Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings\"; Kenner produced and sponsored it.\n\nIn December 1983, American Greetings and CPG Products lost a lawsuit against Easter Unlimited, importers of a line known as \"Message Bears\". According to New York City judge Leonard B. Sand, those toys lacked the \"heart-shaped 'touché tags'\" used to identify the Care Bears.\n\nIn 1984, AGC introduced a spin-off line, the Care Bear Cousins; another syndicated special, \"The Care Bears Battle the Freeze Machine\", came out that same year. A miniseries based on the toys was distributed by Lexington Broadcast Services Company. A year later, the Bears and Cousins starred in their first film, \"The Care Bears Movie\", produced by Nelvana Limited and released by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. It became the highest-grossing animated film made outside the Disney market at the time of its release. Later that autumn, DIC Entertainment released an 11-episode television series in syndication.\n\nIn 1986, Nelvana returned to the franchise with a second movie, \"\". Released by Columbia Pictures, the film featured a new villain, Dark Heart, and introduced more of the Care Bears and Care Bears Cousins: Harmony Bear, True Heart Bear, and Noble Heart Horse.\n\nLater that year, a TV series titled \"The Care Bears Family\" (also from Nelvana) premiered on the U.S. ABC network and Canada's Global. Lasting two seasons and consisting of over 70 episodes, this introduced the evil wizard No Heart and his sidekick Beastly. In the second season, No Heart's niece Shreeky was introduced.\n\nThe Care Bears' third film, \"The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland\", debuted in 1987. A TV special, \"Care Bears Nutcracker Suite\", premiered on the Disney Channel in 1988.\n\nOver 40 million Care Bears were sold between 1983 and 1987, and American Greetings printed over 70 million of their cards during the decade. In whole, the sales of their merchandise reached over $2 billion during the 1980s.\n\nIn early 1991, Those Characters from Cleveland and Kenner embarked on a relaunch of the franchise, involving seven bears. One of the Care Bear Cousins, Proud Heart Cat, was released as a bear with white fur that sported the belly symbol of a heart-shaped American flag. The publishing company Random House released two tie-in books: \"The Care Bears and the Big Cleanup\" (1991) by Bobbi Katz, and \"The Care Bears and the Whale Tale\" (1992) by Peggy Kahn.\n\nIn 1999, the rights to the Care Bears franchise were bought by Jay Foreman, the president of Fort Lauderdale-based Play Along Toys, for less than $1 million; he also planned to acquire fellow American Greeting Cards property Strawberry Shortcake. Three years later, Kenton Avery Frederick American Greetings relaunched the Care Bear brand as part of the Bears' 20th anniversary celebration with a series of plush toys and movies. The artwork and design of the bears were changed for relaunch. Also, Champ Bear's colours were changed from tan to true blue, with his belly symbol changed to a winner's cup with a star, and Share Bear's belly symbol was changed from a milkshake with two straws to two lollipops crossed. The change to Share Bear's symbol stems from Play Along Toys' suggestion of the change on the grounds that sharing a milkshake may spread germs. Apart from that, many other minor changes were made to the designs, mostly involving lightening the colors of the bears and minor redesigns to the belly symbols.\n\nIn the midst of this revival, Play Along released brand new toys based on the newly redesigned Bears, sold at stores such as Wal-Mart, Kmart, Toys \"R\" Us, Target, KB Toys, and Mervyns. The new merchandise included the Bears doing aerobics; Tenderheart Bear as a patient (casting the child that is playing with the toy as the doctor); Champ Bear as a fireman; and the Care Bears themselves as Cubs. Over 70 million plush Bears have been sold since the re-launch. In addition, Lionsgate Home Entertainment and subsidiary FHE Pictures, in association with Nelvana, have made two direct-to-DVD computer-animated films, \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\" in 2004 and \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" in 2005. Various other music CDs featuring the bears and video games were also produced.\n\nNew versions of the various cousins were produced (with Proud Heart being changed back into a cat, in a different color and the same symbol she had in the 1980s franchise). Two of the Cousins, Treat Heart Pig and Noble Heart Horse, were never produced as 13 inch plushes in the 2000s, and the Cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 relaunch of the franchise.\n\nIn 2007, American Greetings relaunched Care Bears again, first with a series of dolls, then a new movie, \"\" and immediately before with a new TV series \"\". The animation and artwork is completely different from the originals giving the Care Bears have smaller body structures and redesigned belly symbols, which are now called belly badges. Also, instead of Nelvana, the film and the animated series are produced by SD Entertainment.\n\nAs part of the franchise's 25th anniversary celebrations, the Bears were redesigned by the American Greetings Properties illustration team, as was the logo of the franchise. The line consists of fifteen of the thirty-nine bears (as seen in \"\"). Five of the bears were chosen to be the focus of the franchise: Oopsy Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear and Share Bear. The other bears include Wish Bear, True Heart Bear, Bedtime Bear, Tenderheart Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Harmony Bear, Amigo Bear, Surprise Bear, Superstar Bear, Do Your Best Bear, Best Friend Bear, Play-A-Lot Bear, Heartsong Bear, Good Luck Bear and Hopeful Heart Bear, although the remaining 24 bears are also stated to have a release in the near future according to Play Along Toys.\n\nTheir new theme song is performed by former Letters to Cleo member, Kay Hanley, and the music video premiered on Fox and Nickelodeon. In August 2007, they appeared in the film \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\". This was followed by the television series from SD Entertainment, \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\". The series premiered on CBS' \"KEWLopolis\" block on September 15, 2007.\n\nThe Care Bears franchise was rebooted upon the 2007 relaunch. Prior plot devices like the Cloudmobiles, Caring Meter, the Cloud Keeper, and even Care-a-lot castle were not referred to or mentioned as of the new series. In its place is the gathering tree, which is where the Care Bears now gather to meet or hold festivities. Also, the Care Bears have, up until the point of the first direct-to-DVD release for the new franchise (\"Grizzle-ly Adventures\"), never had humans visit Care-a-lot, and a new villain named Grizzle (who seeks to conquer Care-a-lot and nothing else) was introduced. A February 2007 article in the \"Wall Street Journal\" states that in the new version, \"they live in a village, centered on a big tree; with no castle in sight\".\n\nHowever, the Caring Meter made its return in \"Grizzle-y Adventures\", and the second direct-to-DVD release of the franchise, \"Ups and Downs\", included a passing remark regarding the Forest of Feelings. In addition, Care-a-lot castle reappeared in certain scenes in the new game for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, \"Play Day\".\n\nOn July 23, 2008, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears (along with \"Strawberry Shortcake\") would be sold to Cookie Jar Entertainment in an acquisition due to take place on September 30, 2008. By April 2009, it was announced that Cookie Jar Entertainment had problems in financing the acquisition and that a French company called MoonScoop has also expressed interest in the franchise. The deadline for Cookie Jar's acquisition was April 30, and MoonScoop's attempt June 7. In mid-August 2009, MoonScoop sued American Greetings, claiming the latter backed out of the planned US$95 million deal; AGC and Cookie Jar sued each other in the process as well. In late April 2010, the Cleveland company \"won summary judgment on MoonScoop SAS' contract\", as well as \"promissory estoppel claims\" in the case; MoonScoop filed for an appeal the following month. At the end of November 2012, the US District Court in Cleveland ruled in favor of American Greetings over MoonScoop.\n\nIn late 2009, American Greetings announced that the Care Bears will be re-imagined with the launch of a new series, \"Care Power Team\". This re-imagining re-used the \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\" designs, has the bears sport \"enhanced belly badges\", and sees the bears taking on emergencies. Soon after, a trio of new films appeared: \"\", \"\" and \"Care Bears: To the Rescue\". In the same year, it was announced that the master rights to the toys for the Care Bears have changed hands from Play Along Toys to Hasbro, in a deal that also involved Strawberry Shortcake. However, it was only in mid-2013 that the first Care Bear toys from Hasbro appeared. There has been no word on what caused the delay.\n\nIn July 2011, the card company announced that a new television series, the franchise's first in CGI, is in development. Entitled \"\", it premiered on The Hub on June 2, 2012.\n\nIn December 2013, AG Properties and Mindworks Entertainment announced they will collaborate with Sanrio for a co-branding with the character franchise \"Little Twin Stars\". An expanded rollout is expected in March 2014.\n\nIn July 2014, it was announced that Hasbro has lost the rights to making the toys to another toy company called \"Just Play\". It is widely thought that the reason for the change is due to American Greetings being unhappy with how long it took Hasbro to release a toyline from the time it acquired the rights to make the toys.\n\nIn October 2014, When The Hub changed over to Discovery Family, it was revealed that Welcome to Care-A-Lot has been cancelled and that there won't be further work on the show.\n\nIn January 15, 2015, it was revealed that Netflix had commissioned a new series called \"Care Bears and Cousins\" after The Hub cancelled \"Welcome to Care-a-Lot\". The show was originally expected to premiere sometime in 2016, but the release was eventually pushed back to November 2015 and it premiered with six episodes. It was followed by another six episodes.\n\nIn September 2018, a new television series, titled \"Care Bears: Unlock the Magic\", was announced. The series is to premiere on the Boomerang premium streaming service. The series order includes 48 11-minute regular episodes, two 22-minute specials and 20 shorts. The series will introduce a new character named Dibble, who will serve as \"the team\"s newest pet and companion\". \n\nThe franchise consists mainly of the Care Bears themselves, as well as the later additions the Care Bear Cousins. Both of them live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (home to the Care Bear Cousins). In 1989, Carole Ashkinaze of \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" referred to them as \"the whimsical, late 20th-century descendents of what we used to know as guardian angels: furry, friendly, adorable creatures whose mission is to guide small children and protect them from bogeymen. Running against a Care Bear is like, well, running against the Easter Bunny.\"\n\nAccompanying them are the Star and Heart Buddies, who look out for the Bears and Cousins whenever they are on missions in caring; and the Birds, who are usually seen in the Forest of Feelings with the Care Bear Cousins and watch over them. A less recurring character is The Cloud Keeper, the portly gentleman who maintains Care-a-lot. He only appeared in some of the franchise's early publications and on the DiC-produced TV episodes.\n\nThe ten original Care Bears consisted of Bedtime Bear, Birthday Bear, Cheer Bear, Friend Bear, Funshine Bear, Good Luck Bear, Grumpy Bear, Love-a-lot Bear, Tenderheart Bear, and Wish Bear. Later on, additional bears joined them, as well as the Cousins.\n\nFor the new 2007 TV series, \"\", five of the Care Bears were chosen to be the main characters of the show. As seen on the Care Bears website, they are Share Bear, Cheer Bear, Funshine Bear, Grumpy Bear, and the new bear introduced in the movie, Oopsy Bear who would frequently make a mess of things. However, the other Care Bears still make appearances in the series. The unofficial role of leader of the bears, as of the new series, was transferred from Tenderheart Bear to Cheer Bear. The cousins were not relaunched in the 2007 series.\n\nSome elements of the Care Bears franchise pay homage to the legend of King Arthur. For example, the name of the main characters' residence, Care-a-lot, is a play on King Arthur's legendary Camelot castle. The Care Bear Family sits around a heart-shaped table, similar to the Round Table used by Arthur and his knights. In addition, Sir Lancelot's name inspired that of Love-a-lot Bear.\n\nThroughout the movies and series, various villains have tried to stop the Bears and Cousins in the background on their missions. On the first two specials and DiC television series, they battled against Professor Coldheart, his assistant Frostbite, and occasionally Auntie Freeze; in Nelvana's version, they faced Wizard No Heart, his bumbling assistant Beastly and his ill-tempered niece Shreeky, and minor villains such as Dr. Fright and Sour Sam. In the movies, they went up against Nicholas and the Evil Spirit in \"The Care Bears Movie\", Dark Heart in \"\", The Wizard of Wonderland and his assistants Dim & Dumb in \"The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland\", and the Rat King and Evil Vizier in \"Care Bears Nutcracker Suite\". Following the 2002 revival, Sir Funnybone the rat was introduced as a villain in the movie \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\", while \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" broke from tradition in that it did not have a villain. For the 2007 revival, the new film \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\" introduced new villains, Grizzle and WingNut, who persists into the new TV series, \"\".\n\nThe Care Bears' ultimate weapon is the \"Care Bear Stare\" (a.k.a. \"Belly Magic\"), in which the collected Bears stand together and radiate light from their respective belly symbols. These combine to form a ray of love and good cheer which could bring care and joy into the target's heart. The Care Bear Stare has several different looks. One has a beam coming from the belly being made up of several replicated images of the symbol. Another variation forms a rainbow when multiple Bears and/or Cousins are involved. A yellow beam with red hearts is sometimes seen as well. The movies \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\" and \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\" do not feature the Care Bear stare, but it does return in \"Oopsy Does It!\". In the new series, \"Care Bears Adventures in Care-a-lot\", the stare appears as a beam of light in the color of the bear from which it originates, but is initiated by simply rubbing the symbol.\n\nIn the original animated specials and the DiC series, the Care Bear Stare is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears...prepare to stare!\" while in the Nelvana series and later versions it is initiated by the phrase \"Care Bears Countdown!\"\n\nDuring the movies and the DiC series, the Care Bear Cousins call their weapon the \"Care Bear Cousin Call\". In the DiC series, the call looks identical to the Care Bear Stare and is often performed at the same time without it being referred to as the call. In the first movie, the Cousins, excluding Swift Heart Rabbit, simply made whatever animal noise is common to their species since they did not have any belly symbols; those are later given to them by the Care Bears at the end of the movie. In the second movie, the Call looks like a musical score which radiates from their belly symbols. By the start of the Nelvana series, the Care Bear Cousin Call was no longer used and the Cousins simply performed the Care Bear Stare.\n\nAlthough commonly used on villains, the stare and call have been also been used on humans and the Care Bears themselves. It was occasionally used in the DiC series to cure Care Bears and humans who were placed under the effects of Professor Coldheart's uncaring magic. It also occurred once in \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\", when it was used to temporarily cheer Grumpy up in the episode \"Tell-Tale belly\".\n\nIn addition to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use their belly symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges and sending out a distress signal.\n\nShown prominently in most of the Care Bears movies and TV episodes made in the 80s, the Caring Meter is typically in the dead center of Care-a-lot inside the Care Bears' main meeting hall. This meter shows how much caring there is both in Care-a-lot and on Earth. In the 1980s movies/cartoons, it is shown as an un-numbered clock-like meter. In \"The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie\", the meter is shown with a raincloud (less caring) side and a rainbow (more caring) side. Ideally, the Caring Meter should be all the way towards the rainbow side. Whenever the Bears see the meter drop towards the raincloud side, they try to prevent it from getting worse by going on \"caring missions\" to try to get more people to care or for the Bears themselves to do caring deeds. If the meter drops near zero, Care-a-lot will suffer disasters, such as thunderstorms, buildings and rainbows crumbling (earlier movies) or the bright colors of Care-a-lot gradually turning into black and white (later movies). If the meter were to reach all the way to zero (there is no caring \"anywhere\"), then Care-a-lot would be gone forever.\n\nInitially, no mention was made of the Caring Meter in \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\" and the first season of \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\". With the release of \"Grizzle-y Adventures\", the franchise's first direct-to-DVD release, the Caring Meter has returned, and the Care Bears have begun to interact with humans once again.\n\nApart from toys, books, greeting cards and animated media, the Care Bears have been prominently featured in merchandising as well, some of which includes gummy bears, party goods, cell phone covers, interior decoration sets, stationery, school supplies, stickers, clothing, accessories and many other goods. During the early 2000s relaunch, the classic Care Bear toys were available at stores such as Carlton Cards, Claire's, and Spencer Gifts.\n\nWhen the franchise was introduced in the 1980s, a mistake was made while manufacturing the stuffed animals causing Bedtime Bear (blue) and Wish Bear (aqua) to swap colors. As soon as the mistake was discovered, the two bears returned into their appropriate colors. Later, a children's story was written explaining why the bears had switched colors.\n\nIn his 1986 essay, \"The Shortcake Strategy\", Tom Englehardt referred to the Care Bears dolls as \"highly specialized\" toys. \"So specialized [are they] that instead of being complex individual personalities, they are no more than carefully labeled fragments of a personality\", he stated. \"Together, they must engage in a series of specialized interventions as complex as those of any real-life medical unit.\"\n\nMany children's books have been based on, and have featured, the Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. Some early publications include \"Meet the Care Bear Cousins\" (based on the first movie), \"Sweet Dreams for Sally\", \"The Witch Down the Street\", \"The Trouble with Timothy\", and \"A Sister for Sam\". All of these titles were published by toy makers Parker Brothers, who was a licensee of the characters. Over 45 million Care Bears books were sold during the 1980s. As of 2006, Scholastic Press has published books based on the Bears' first two CGI films, as well as the new toys, while Modern Publishing publishes a small number of activity and baby books featuring the bears for the toddler market. Publications International and Penny Candy Press are also known to have published a few sound books featuring the bears in the past.\n\nIn \"Playing by Different Rules\", a 1988 book chronicling the Parker Brothers/General Mills merger, Ellen Wojahn wrote that Parker's Care Bears books (along with those based on sister property Strawberry Shortcake) \"were, in fact, little more than illustrated brochures for Kenner's projects—and who knew [by 1984] how long the likes of these characters would remain popular?\"\n\nBetween November 1985 and January 1989, the Care Bears appeared in a 20-issue comic book series published by Marvel's Star Comics; the books were drawn by DC Comics artist Howard Post. The November 13, 1986 issue featured a crossover with another American Greetings property, the Madballs.\n\nDuring the same period, over in Britain the Care Bears also appeared in a comic book series published by Marvel UK with artwork by Mario Capaldi. The periodic comics were later bundled into hardcover Care Bear Annual books. Some of these UK comic book issues also had stories and art from the US comic series.\n\nAt the height of the '80s Care Bears craze, Kid Stuff Records released several LPs based on the franchise. These included \"Introducing the Care Bears\", \"The Care Bears Care For You\", \"Adventures in Care-a-lot\", \"The Care Bears' Birthday Party\", and \"The Care Bears' Christmas\" (all from 1983), and 1986's \"Friends Make Everything Better\" (released as a promotion with Trianimic). They released the soundtrack albums for the first two movies. The albums based on the toys were best sellers in children's music during their prime.\n\nAll of the albums from 1983 (except for \"Birthday Party\") featured writing, production, and performance credits from Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan (who were the lead singers of The Turtles, also known as Flo & Eddie; former Mothers of Invention from Frank Zappa's 1970–1972 period). The soundtrack album from The Care Bears Movie featured songs by Carole King and John Sebastian, who sang lead for The Lovin' Spoonful.\n\nIn the midst of the 2002 revival, Madacy Kids released brand new Care Bear CDs. In 2004, \"Meet the Care Bears\", \"Care Bears Holiday Hugs\", \"Care Bears Christmas Eve\", and the \"Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot\" soundtrack album came out, as well as \"Care Bears Nighty-Night\" the following year.\n\nThe cover of both \"Care Bears Holiday Hugs\" and \"Care Bears Nighty-Night\" advertises another two CDs, called \"Care Bears Share A Smile\" and \"Care Bears Let's Be Friends\". As of April 2008, Both Share A Smile and Let's Be Friends have been folded into a single album and released as a digital download from www.Amazon.com and www.Walmart.com, however it is at this date not available as a physical CD. This has caused some difficulties to international fans as Amazon.com and Walmart.com will not sell digital downloads to fans who reside outside North America.\n\nApproximately 50 seconds into the music video for the breakout single \"I Need Some Fine Wine and You, You Need to Be Nicer\" from Swedish rock band The Cardigans' sixth studio album \"Super Extra Gravity\", there is a brief appearance of Bedtime Bear. He is shown again for the last time at the 76th second, lying on a bed in close proximity to the featured dog.\n\nA Care Bears game was planned for the Atari 2600 in 1983. It was preliminarily completed and ready for beta testing, but the project was canceled before testing could begin. The beta prototype subsequently disappeared into obscurity and the only known existing prototype to date is an early alpha of the game. No other games featuring the bears were ever made during the period.\n\nIn 2004, the Bears starred in their first official game, \"Care-a-lot Jamboree\" for the PC. A few months later, another game featuring the Care Bears for the PC, \"Let's Have a Ball!\" was released. In the same year they were featured in \"Care Bears: A Lesson in Caring\" for the V.Smile educational game console.\n\nIn 2005, they appeared in \"Catch a Star\" (also for the PC) and \"Care Bears: Care Quest\" (for the Game Boy Advance).\n\nLike the movies, no game for any systems was produced in 2006, and no new game was released in time for the 2007 relaunch. However, in August 2008, a new game, \"Care Bears Play Day\", was released for the V.Smile Baby Infant Development System, finally breaking the two years of silence for the franchise on the gaming front.\n\nthem, \"Care Bears Share-A-Story\", was introduced by Play Along in July 2005. The toy is based upon the same basic idea of a Teddy Ruxpin. The head, mouth and eyes of the Care Bear move around as a cartridge plays fairy tales such as Goldilocks and the Three Care Bears, Jack and the Beanstalk and the Three Little Pigs. A hardback book version of the story comes with it so the parent and child can read along as the story plays. The toy ships with the story \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\", and additional story cartridges and books are to be purchased separately. Also, apparently only Share Bear was ever made as such a toy.\n\nAdditionally, Care Bears Sing-along pals were also introduced. These Care Bears plush toys sing three different songs while their heads rock back and forth and could synchronize wirelessly with other singing Care Bears of the series to sing together in a group (the effective wireless coverage being three feet, although the range might deteriorate due to environmental conditions and remaining battery strength). While initially introduced in a rather large variety of designs, at the moment only the Share Bear, Cheer Bear and Funshine Bear models are still being made, with the physical appearance of the bears redesigned to match the 25th anniversary looks.\n\nAnother Care Bear smart toy is the Care Bears Tenderheart Smart Check-up. The toy comes with an interactive plush Tenderheart bear and various toy medical equipment. The interactive plush has soft-touch points throughout the body and can be fully played with without the toy medical equipment.\n\nLastly, there are a line of Care Bears smart toys that would play hide and seek with the owner. The line, called \"Hide 'N Seek Care Bears\", comes in two designs: Secret Bear and Surprise Bear. Both bear comes with a wireless handpiece. To play the toy, a third party, usually the parent, must partake in the game by hiding the bear. The child then has to find the bear, with the handpiece occasionally providing hints on how close the child is to the bear through audible instructions.\n\nThe Care Bears appeared in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985. With the redesign of the characters on the heels of their 25th anniversary, the Care Bears returned to the parade for the holiday in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Also in those latter two years, they appeared at the Macy's Flower Show in the flagship New York store.\n\nIn 1984 and 1985, the Care Bears appeared at the San Diego Zoo in California, performing in a stage show at the amphitheater.\n\nTenderheart Bear, Funshine Bear and Cheer Bear appeared in a live-action 1985 TV special produced by ABC station WLS-TV in Chicago called \"Be A Safe Kid\", teaching kids how to be safe from strangers.\n\nIn the Summer and Fall of 1986 and 1987, the ABC television network toured shopping malls across the country with their stage show \"The ABC Family Fun Fair\" promoting their Saturday morning cartoon lineup for those years. With \"The Care Bears Family\" series as part of that block, some of the cast were part of the show...Funshine Bear, Cheer Bear and Braveheart Lion in the 1986 edition and Cheer Bear with Tenderheart Bear in the 1987 tour.\n\nDuring the Summers from 1988 through 1992, the Care Bears were the official characters in residence at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom near Allentown PA. On the park's Center Stage, they performed in \"The Care Bear Song & Dance Revue\" and also did many walkabout meets & greets with guests around the amusement park. Dorney Park also had the animatronic \"Care-A-Lot Castle\" show created by Sally Industries.\n\nTenderheart Bear appeared at the Teddy Bear Rally in Amherst, MA from 1996 to 2005.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, the Care Bears have appeared in the DooDah Parade in Ocean City, NJ.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the Care Bears starred in their own stage show, called \"Care Bears Live\", organized by VEE Corporation.\n\nThe Care Bears appeared in the 2007 St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, where, as grand marshal, Good Luck Bear ceremoneously dyed the Chicago River green from a motorboat.\n\nThe Care Bears have been appearing in the annual Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, BC, Canada since 2008.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday season, the Care Bears have done shows and appearances in Singapore at the Downtown East shopping mall and entertainment district from 2008 through 2010.\n\nDuring the 2010s, Tenderheart Bear has appeared in the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade in New York City.\n\nFunshine Bear and Share Bear appear in America's Children's Holiday Parade taking place in Oakland, CA early during the Christmas season.\n\nFunshine and Share have also been appearing in the Indy 500 Festival Parade in Indianapolis, IN over Memorial Day weekend.\n\nAs part of the Care Bears' 30th Anniversary, Share Bear appeared at the Noodlecat restaurant in San Diego, CA as part of The Hub's presence at Comicon 2012.\n\nAlso in connection with their 30th anniversary, Cheer Bear appeared at The Toonseum in Pittsburgh, PA during a 2012 exhibit about the Care Bears' animated television series, and also at the Pittsburgh Comic Arts Festival sponsored by them.\n\nOn the weekend in the middle of June 2013, Funshine Bear, Cheer Bear, Share Bear and Grumpy Bear appeared onstage for \"A Care Bears Dance Party\" at Sesame Place in Langhorne, PA.\n\nIn July 2013, Funshine Bear and Love-A-Lot Bear appeared at Anthrocon, a convention for the furry fandom in Pittsburgh, PA, which took place in the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.\n\nIn April 2015, Cheer Bear appeared in the Cherry Blossom Parade in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44134802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44134802", "title": "Carlos Bettini", "text": "Carlos Bettini\n\nCarlos Antonio Bautista Bettini Francese is an Argentinian businessman, politician, and diplomat who was the Argentinian ambassador to Spain and Andorra. In his youth he was a close friend of Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, both of whom appointed him to the ambassadorship during their terms as president of Argentina. His appointment to this position was a matter of considerable controversy owing to his background as a lobbyist for Spanish businesses in Argentina.\n\nBettini, who was a member of the Montoneros, a militant left-wing group of the 1960s and 70s, has been accused to be the perpetrator of a famous murder in 1976. More recently, his activities on behalf of Spanish interests have caused him to face charges of corruption and bribery.\n\nBettini was born on October 13, 1951, in La Plata, where his family was one of the best known and wealthiest families in the city. In his youth he played rugby for a club called San Luis.\n\nBettini was a friend of Cristina Fernández when they were in their teens in La Plata. Some sources say that they were romantically involved. He knew Cristina five years before they both met Néstor Kirchner. His connections to both Kirchners would end up being pivotal in shaping his political and diplomatic career. To this day he is described as an “intimate” of Cristina Kirchner.\n\nIn his early years, Bettini belonged to the Montoneros, a militant left-wing group of the 1960s and 70s, and according to some sources was the principal perpetrator of the “ETA-style” murder of retired Naval Captain Jorge Bigliardi on a street in La Plata on June 12, 1976. It was said that Bettini was able to approach Bigliardi without arousing suspicion because they were friends. Bettini, who went by the alias Soldado Emilio, is said to have committed the crime in collaboration with his brother and another member of the Montoneros. Some sources indicate that his brother-in-law Jorge Devoto, another Naval Captain who lived in the same building as Bigliardi, was another proposed target for assassination by Bettini and his confederates.\n\nBettini's father, Antonio Bautista Bettini, was a federal prosecutor and a professor at several universities who was “disappeared” in 1977 during the military dictatorship. His brother, Marcelo Gabriel José Bettini, a student of agronomics, was “disappeared” in 1976; Jorge Alberto Daniel Devoto, a Naval Captain who was the husband of Bettini's sister Maria, was “disappeared” in 1977. Bettini's maternal grandmother, María de las Mercedes Hourquebie de Francese, was also “disappeared” in that year.\n\nBettini went into exile in Spain after the disappearances of his family members. He received a law degree in 1986 from Universidad Complutense de Madrid in Spain.\n\nIn Spain, Bettini became a close friend and political and business ally of Felipe González, the longtime leader of Spain's Socialist Workers' Party. He also had business dealings with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, the richest man in the world. In addition, he is said to have befriended a circle of pro-Franco industrialists and members of the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei.\n\nAfter Isabel Martínez de Perón was released from Spanish prison and moved to Madrid, Bettini reportedly “approached her and won her confidence” and developed a “close relationship” to her, soon taking the place of Mario Rotundo, who had been in charge of the assets she had inherited from her husband. After he took over this role, Bettini reportedly was an “accomplice” of Argentinian President Carlos Menem and Isabel Perón in the management of several funds.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1993, he served as an advisor on foreign relations to the Spanish government Ombudsman, a position that during those years was held in turn by Joaquín Ruiz-Giménez Cortés, Álvaro Gil-Robles, and Margarita Retuerto Buades. He is said to have acquired this job thanks to the influence of González, who also arranged for Bettini to receive Spanish citizenship.\n\nReturning to Argentina in 1991, Bettini served between 1993 and 1996 as the director of Aerolineas Argentinas. During part of his tenure in this position, he also worked as a lobbyist in Argentina for Spanish companies. Spanish politician and union leader Ariel Basteiro called this “the period of greatest depletion” for the airline, explaining that under Bettini's control its interests shifted from Argentina to Spain, specifically toward the Spanish state airline, Iberia. According to Basteiro, Bettini promoted a business strategy for the airline that involved borrowing a hundred million dollars, selling real estate, equipment, and aircraft, and cutting back on services. The result was a significant loss of market share to Iberia.\n\nDuring the presidency of Carlos Menem, he was a consultant in the Ministry of Justice under Jorge Maiorano, Rodolfo Barra, and Elias Jassán. He was the head of the cabinet of Attorney General Nicolás Becerra from 1998 until Becerra's retirement in February 2004.\n\nDuring the years 1993 to 1996, he was also a member of the organizing committee for IDEA (Instituto para el Desarrollo Empresarial de la Argentina) and a member of Patronato de la Fundación Euroamérica. He was Argentina's representative to the annual meeting of the UN Commission for the Prevention of Crime in Vienna (1994,1995) and to an international conference of Ombudsmen in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1994.\n\nIn December 1999, Patricia Bullrich, then Minister of Corrections, filed a complaint against Bettini with federal Judge Jorge Urso for corruption, specifically for an attempt to bribe Bullrich herself, in connection with his alleged activity on behalf of a Spanish firm, Dycasa, that sought to secure a contract to build and renovate prisons in Argentina. Bullrich's allegations were studied by the Anti-Corruption Bureau, which suggested prosecuting him, at the very least, on the charge of inappropriate exercise of public functions. Although there was a raid on Bettini's office and a plan was apparently underway to prosecute Bettini, it came to nothing. Proceedings against him were halted, and it was widely argued that this happened because of his high position and connections. It was noted in particular that Becerra, his superior, had close ties to Dycasa.\n\nOn June 2, 2001, Bullrich, then Minister of Labor, said in a television interview “that...no one had shown interest in the proposed privatization of Aerolineas Argentinas” in 1990 and that “Carlos Menem had to personally call Felipe González to ask that Iberia do so.” A report by a committee of experts who ruled that the proposal was inviable \"economically and technically” never came to anything.\n\nAt one point, Bettini also was the subject of a preliminary probe into charges of conspiracy, involving payments made to benefit the interests of the so-called “Floating Casino.”\n\nBettini has been Argentina's Ambassador to the Kingdom of Spain and the Principality of Andorra since August 6, 2004. He has served in this capacity under both President Néstor Kirchner and President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.\n\nHis appointment as ambassador to Spain caused controversy because he had no diplomatic background and was viewed as a lobbyist for Spanish business interests in Argentina. Patricia Bullrich openly criticized his appointment, saying that it was inappropriate to appoint a lobbyist for Spain to the ambassadorship. Bullrich cited Bettini's alleged actions on behalf of Dycasa, and noted that he had been reported at the time to the Anti-Corruption Bureau. Bettini denied having ever worked as a lobbyist, and announced that he would file a complaint against Bullrich in response to her accusations. Opposition leader Elisa Carrio warned that if he was appointed ambassador, she would “file a criminal complaint for illegal appointment.”\n\nOne source noted that although Bettini, upon being appointed ambassador to Spain, denied ever having been a lobbyist or representative for Spanish companies, stating that such activities would be inappropriate for a public official or diplomat, he had explicitly identified himself in 2000 as a lobbyist for Spanish business and political interests.\n\nIn a 2013 public address by Maria Bettini, the “disappearances” of the Bettini family members were used to contrast the terror and human-rights abuses of the military dictatorship with what Carlos Bettini himself, at that event, described as the benign human-rights policies of the Kirchners.\n\nIn 2004 the Kingdom of Spain awarded Bettini the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabel the Catholic, with the degree of Commendation. This award was viewed as a reflection of the closeness of Bettini's relationship with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party.\n"}

{"id": "5541266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5541266", "title": "Collegiate Middle Level Association", "text": "Collegiate Middle Level Association\n\nThe Collegiate Middle Level Association (CMLA) is a student association designed to promote and support the professional development of future middle level teachers, as well as the development and nurturing of middle level education programs. CMLA is an affiliate of National Middle School Association. Currently, Otterbein College is serving as the national host site for the organization's leadership. Their two-year leadership term will conclude November 2011 with CMLA's annual meeting at NMSA's headquarters in Columbus, OH.\n\n\nJohn Swaim,\nCMLA Advisory Chair\n\nThe Collegiate Middle Level Association currently has 31 chapters. These 31 chapters represent a growing number of colleges and universities who are now preparing teachers to teach young adolescents in American's middle schools. This would have been an unthinkable dream for a handful of college students in the middle school teacher education program at the University of Northern Colorado who were trying to create a national organization for students preparing to become middle school teachers in 1988. At that time there were only 18 states that had middle school certification or endorsement as opposed to 46 states today. In 1988 middle school teacher education programs were the exception rather than the rule. Even more rare were middle school teacher education programs with active student organizations. As the decade of the 90s began there were only four higher education institutions that had active middle school student groups, University of Northern Colorado, University of Northern Iowa, Illinois State University, and Appalachian State University.\n\nIn 1989, under the leadership of Ned Gilardino, a UNC student, a constitution was drafted and the Student Association for Middle Education (SAME) was born. Its name was later changed to Collegiate Middle Level Association (CMLA). That same year CMLA made a presentation to the NMSA Board of Trustees. The Board recognized CLMA and agreed to help finance them by sharing a percentage of the membership fee of all college students who joined NMSA and had an interest in also becoming a member of CMLA. However, joining by individual membership did not provide the stability that was needed to help the association grow. In fact, when the elections were held the officers often came from several different campuses which made it difficult to conduct the business of the association.\n\nThen, in 1995 two significant events occurred that moved CMLA to a new level. First, NMSA recognized CMLA as an official affiliate member, joining other state middle school associations. Secondly, CMLA moved from an individual membership to a chapter membership. The constitution underwent major revisions that not only changed membership from individual to chapter membership, but also changed how the association would be financed and governed. An advisory board was established consisting of the chapter advisors of all the member chapters. The officers were now elected from one campus that applied and was approved by the Advisory Board to be the host site for a two year term. Financing was more closely aligned with NMSA. The association was able to have two annual meetings rather than just meeting at the NMSA annual conference.\n\nAt first CMLA grew slowly under this newly revised structure. However, as more states legislated middle school teacher licensure and more colleges and universities began to develop middle school teacher education programs, CMLA provided an ever increasing number of prospective middle school teachers the opportunity to become professionally involved as middle level educators.\n\nThe following colleges and universities have been leadership host sites for CMLA since the new restructuring: Otterbein College (2009–Present); Georgia College & State University (2007-2009); University of Dayton (2005-2007); Ashland University (2003-2005); Appalachian State University (2001-2003); Central Michigan University (1999-2001); Missouri Southern State University (1997-1999); and Illinois State University (1995-1997).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "396723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=396723", "title": "Diseconomies of scale", "text": "Diseconomies of scale\n\nIn microeconomics, diseconomies of scale are the cost disadvantages that firms and governments accrue due to increase in firm size or output, resulting in production of goods and services at increased per-unit costs. This typically follows the law of diminishing returns, where further increase in size of output will result in even greater increase in average cost. This concept is the opposite of economies of scale. In business, diseconomies of scale are the factors that lead to an increase in average costs as a business grows beyond a certain size.\n\nIdeally, all employees of a firm would have one-on-one communication with each other so they know exactly what the other workers are doing. A firm with a single worker does not require any communication between employees. A firm with two workers requires one communication channel, directly between those two workers. A firm with three workers requires three communication channels between employees (between employees A & B, B & C, and A & C). Here is a chart of one-on-one communication channels required:\nThe graph of all one-on-one channels is a complete graph.\n\nThe number of one-on-one channels of communication grows more rapidly than the number of workers, thus increasing the time and costs of communication. At some point one-on-one communications between all workers becomes impractical; therefore only certain groups of employees will communicate with one another (e.g. within departments or within geographical locations). This reduces, but does not stop, the increase in unit costs; and also the organisation will incur some inefficiencies due to the reduced level of communication.\n\nAn organisation with just one person cannot have any duplication of effort between employees. If there are two employees, there could be some duplication of efforts, but this is likely to be minor, as each of the two will generally know what the other is working on. When organisations grow to thousands of workers, it is inevitable that someone, or even a team, will take on a function that is already being handled by another person or team. In colloquial terms, this is described as \"one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing\". General Motors, for example, developed two in-house CAD/CAM systems: CADANCE was designed by the GM Design Staff, while Fisher Graphics was created by the former Fisher Body division. These similar systems later needed to be combined into a single Corporate Graphics System, CGS, at great expense. A smaller firm would have had neither the money to allow such expensive parallel developments, nor the lack of communication and cooperation which precipitated this event. In addition to CGS, GM also used CADAM, UNIGRAPHICS, CATIA and other off-the-shelf CAD/CAM systems, thus increasing the cost of translating designs from one system to another. This endeavor eventually became so unmanageable that they acquired (and then eventually sold off) Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in an effort to control the situation. Smaller firms typically choose a single off-the-shelf CAD/CAM system, with no need to combine or translate between systems.\n\n\"Office politics\" is management behavior which a manager knows is counter to the best interest of the company, but is in his personal best interest. For example, a manager might intentionally promote an incompetent worker, knowing that the worker will never be able to compete for the manager's job. This type of behavior only makes sense in a company with multiple levels of management. The more levels there are, the more opportunity for this behavior. In a small company, such behavior could cause the company to go bankrupt, and thus cost the manager his job, so he would not make such a decision. In a large company, one manager would not have much effect on the overall health of the company, so such \"office politics\" are in the interest of individual managers.\n\nAs an organisation increases in size, it becomes costly to keep control of a sprawling corporate empire, and this often results in bureaucracy as executives implement more and more levels of management. As firms increase in size, managers will initially provide a net benefit to the firm and increase productivity; however, as a firm grows and covers a larger geographical area and/or employs more people, a principal–agent problem arises, leading to lower productivity. To counter this, executives introduce standards and controls in order to maintain productivity, and this necessitates the hiring of more managers to apply these standards and controls, hence the proportion of managerial to working class begins to lean towards managerial and the company becomes \"top-heavy\". However, these additional managers are not providing additional output: they are spending their time implementing standards and carrying out supervision that is unnecessary in smaller firms, hence the cost-per-unit has increased.\n\nThese do not always increase the cost-per-unit, but do reduce the ability of a large firm to compete.\n\nA small firm only competes with other firms, but larger firms frequently find their own products are competing with each other. A Buick was just as likely to steal customers from another GM make, such as an Oldsmobile, as it was to steal customers from other companies. This may help to explain why Oldsmobiles were discontinued after 2004. This self-competition wastes resources that should be used to compete with other firms.\n\nIf a single person makes and sells donuts and decides to try jalapeño flavoring, they would likely know on the same day whether their decision was good or not, based on the reaction of customers. A decision-maker at a huge company that makes donuts may not know for many months if such a decision worked out or not, especially if their research or marketing team fails to respond in a timely manner. By that time, the decision-makers may very well have moved on to another division or company and thus see no consequence from their decision. This lack of consequences can lead to poor decisions and cause an upward-sloping average cost curve.\n\nIn a reverse example, the smaller firm will know immediately if people begin to request other products, and be able to respond the next day. A large company would need to do research, create an assembly line, determine which distribution chains to use, plan an advertising campaign, etc., before any changes could be made. By this time, the smaller competitors may well have grabbed that market niche.\n\nThis will be defined as the \"we've always done it that way, so there's no need to ever change\" attitude (see appeal to tradition). An old, successful company is far more likely to have this attitude than a new, struggling one. While \"change for change's sake\" is counter-productive, refusal to consider change, even when indicated, is likewise toxic to a company, as changes in the industry and market conditions will inevitably demand changes in the firm in order to remain successful. An example is Polaroid Corporation's delay in moving into digital imaging, which adversely affected the company, ultimately leading to bankruptcy.\n\nSuch opposition is largely a function of the size of the firm. Behavior from Microsoft, which would have been ignored from a smaller firm, was seen as an anti-competitive and monopolistic threat, due to Microsoft's size, thus bringing about government lawsuits.\n\nA small company with only a 1% market share could relatively easily double market share, and hence revenues, in a year. A large company with 50% market share will find it difficult to do so.\n\nA small investment fund can potentially yield a higher return because it can concentrate its investments in a small number of good opportunities without driving up the purchase price as they buy in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large investment fund must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole. As the size of the market controlled grows, the results will be closer to market average.\n\nA company which is heavily dependent on a resource supply of a fixed or relatively-fixed size will have trouble increasing production. For instance, a timber company cannot increase production above the sustainable harvest rate of its land (although it can still increase production by acquiring more land). Similarly, service companies are limited by available labor (and thus tend to concentrate in large, densely-populated metropolitan areas); STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professions are often-cited examples.\n\nLarge firms also tend to be old and in mature markets. Both of these have negative implications for future growth. Old firms tend to have a large retiree base, with high associated pension and health costs, and also tend to be unionized, with associated higher labor costs and lower productivity. Mature markets tend to only offer the potential for small, incremental growth. (Everybody might go out and buy a new invention next year, but it is unlikely they will all buy cars next year, since most people already have them.)\n\nWhile diseconomies of scale are typically associated with large mature firms, similar problems have been observed in the growth phase of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. Mclean has observed that this can occur once the workforce exceeds around 20 employees. At this point business complexity grows more rapidly than revenue. The business experiences falling productivity, leading to rising variable costs along with rapidly rising overheads.\n\nSolutions to the diseconomies of scale for large firms may involve splitting the company into smaller organisations. This can either happen by default when the company is in financial difficulties, sells off its profitable divisions and shuts down the rest; or can happen proactively, if the management is willing.\n\nTo avoid the negative effects of diseconomies of scale, a firm must stick to the lowest average output cost and try to recognise any external diseconomies of scale. Moreover, on reaching the lowest average cost, a firm must either expand to other countries to increase demand for its products, or seek new markets or produce new products that do not compete with its original products. However, neither of these actions will necessarily eliminate communications and management problems often associated with large organisations.\n\nA systematic analysis and redesign of business processes, in order to reduce complexity, can counter diseconomies of scale. (Of course, this phase of analysis and revamping in itself can be, and usually is, a diseconomy leading to hiring of new personnel and investment in new, competing systems.) This leads to increased productivity. Improved management systems and more effective control of labor and operations can lower overhead.\n\nReturning to the example of the large donut firm, each retail location could be allowed to operate relatively autonomously from the company headquarters.\n\nFor instance, the local management may decide on the following factors instead of relying on the central management:\nWhile a single, large, centrally-controlled firm may have higher ability to innovate and develop or market new products more effectively than when its resources are divided, it may lack the flexibility to offer individual customizations. Allowing the different retail locations to make decisions independent of the central management may allow them to meet local consumers' demands more efficiently.\n\nIn addition, if the employees own a portion of the local business, employees will also have more vested interest in its success.\n\nNote that all these changes will likely result in a substantial reduction in corporate headquarters staff and other support staff. For this reason, many businesses delay such a reorganization until it is too late to be effective. However, the whole company incurs reputation and legal risks arising from each unit.\n\n\n"}

He previously served as CEO of Warner Music Group from 2004 to 2011 and as Chairman of Warner Music Group from 2011 to 2012. In May 2011, the sale of WMG was announced; Bronfman would continue as CEO in the transaction. In August 2011, he became Chairman of the company as Stephen Cooper became CEO. Bronfman previously served as CEO of Seagram and vice-chairman of Vivendi Universal. Bronfman Jr. expanded and later divested ownership of the Seagram Company, and also worked as a Broadway and film producer, and songwriter under the pseudonyms Junior Miles and Sam Roman.\n\nBorn in 1955, Edgar Jr. (\"Efer\" to friends) is the son of Edgar Miles Bronfman and the grandson of Samuel Bronfman, patriarch of one of the wealthiest and most influential Jewish families in Canada. The Bronfman family gained its fortunes through the Seagram Company, an alcohol distilling company. Edgar Jr. is the second of five children of Ann (Loeb) and Edgar Miles Bronfman. His mother was the daughter of John Langeloth Loeb Sr. (a Wall Street investment banker whose company was a predecessor of Shearson Lehman/American Express) and Frances Lehman (a scion of the Lehman Brothers banking firm). They divorced in 1973.\n\nBronfman proceeded to a brief career in entertainment in the 1970s as a film and Broadway producer. The summer before his final year of high school, in 1972, he was a credited producer on the film, \"The Blockhouse\". Despite his inexperience, Bronfman's involvement was accepted because of his connections and access to financing through his family's wealth. His Efer Productions company was signed by Universal Studios in 1977 to a three-year movie production contract. He produced the unsuccessful film \"The Border\" (1982), which starred Jack Nicholson.\n\nIn 1982, Bronfman returned to the Seagram Company, spending three months learning the ropes before moving to London to become managing director of Seagram Europe. In 1984, Bronfman returned to New York as President of the House of Seagram, the company's U.S. marketing division. By 1994, he became the Chief Executive Officer, where he began a move away from the traditional liquor business and into entertainment. According to \"Cigar Aficionado,\" Edgar Jr. led the family on a series of disastrous business deals, ultimately losing the family's ownership of Seagram.\n\nThe first step in this diversification was the widely criticized sale of Seagram's stake in DuPont. In 1981, Edgar Bronfman Sr. had sold Seagram's stake in Conoco to DuPont, in exchange for almost 25% of the chemical giant. This stake in DuPont, by 1995, represented about 70% of Seagram's total earnings. Nevertheless, Bronfman Jr., acting as Seagram CEO, approached DuPont about buying back its shares, a deal that DuPont wasted no time in closing.\n\nWith the proceeds of the $9 billion sale, Bronfman Jr. went on an expansion into the entertainment business, in music through the acquisition of Polygram, and in film entertainment through MCA and Universal Pictures. However, the new entertainment conglomerate he created had a brief life, before needing a strategic partner. Bronfman Jr., then led Seagram into a controversial all-stock acquisition by French conglomerate Vivendi in 2000. Bronfman Jr., became chief of the new company, Vivendi Universal, but the Seagram company effectively lost control of its entertainment businesses. Meanwhile, the beverage division—the core of Seagram was acquired by Pernod Ricard and Diageo and divided between the two firms. Seagram, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist.\n\nIn December 2001, Bronfman announced he was stepping down from an executive capacity at Vivendi Universal, but remaining as vice chair of the board.\n\nIn 2002, Bronfman joined private investment firm Accretive LLC as General Partner. The firm focuses on conducting deep market research and hand-selecting firms to back. Among its past projects are Accretive Health and Fandango (ticket service). Companies it currently backs include human resources firm AlphaStaff and small-business insurance company Insureon.\n\nOn February 27, 2004, Bronfman finalized the acquisition of Warner Music Group and served as Chairman and CEO of the music company for the following 7 years. Bronfman helped to transform WMG by rapidly growing the company's digital music sales, redefining the relationships it has with artists and diversifying its revenue streams through its expansion into growing areas of the music business. WMG held an initial public offering of stock in 2005 (NYSE: WMG), and is now the only standalone major music company to be publicly traded. While the stock has fallen from a high in 2005 of over $30 per share, the company has nonetheless produced double-digit growth in its digital business, increased its market share and delivered stable revenue performance despite a drastic music industry decline during the same period. In 2008, \"The New York Times\" reported that WMG's Atlantic Records became the first major record label to generate more than half of its music sales in the U.S. from digital products.\n\nIn May, 2011, WMG and Bronfman announced the company's sale to Access Industries for US$3.3 billion cash. Access is controlled by Russian-born billionaire Len Blavatnik, a former board member and still-substantial shareholder of WMG at the time of the purchase announcement. The sale, coming after a three-month bidding process, \"serves the best interests of stockholders as well as the best interests of music fans, our recording artists and songwriters, and the wonderful people of this company,\" according to a statement released by Bronfman. CEO Bronfman would continue in his post in the transaction, though further job cuts were also foreseen. The investment group which has owned the company since 2004 was said to have received a positive return on its investment.\n\nIn August 2011, Bronfman became Chairman of Warner Music and Stephen Cooper became CEO. He stepped down as Chairman on January 31, 2012. In February 2017, it was reported that Meredith Corp. and a group of investors led by Bronfman Jr. were considering pursuing Time Inc.\n\nHe is currently the chairman of Endeavor, an international non-profit development organization that supports entrepreneurs.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that Bronfman would be launching a new venture capital firm called Waverley Capital, alongside Luminari Capital founder Daniel Leff. This firm would invest in \"innovative and disruptive\" companies within both technology and entertainment, with offices in New York and Palo Alto, California, with a Los Angeles office expected to open in the future.\n\nIn 1973, Bronfman began a songwriting career under the pseudonyms Junior Miles and Sam Roman. He often collaborated with Bruce Roberts on songs like \"Whisper in the Dark\", which he gave to Dionne Warwick to record in thanks for introducing him to his first wife, Sherry. Bronfman also co-wrote \"To Love You More\", which was recorded by Celine Dion, and Barbra Streisand's \"If I Didn't Love You\".\n\nEdgar M. Bronfman, Jr., is the son of Edgar Bronfman, Sr., the billionaire businessman and longtime president of the World Jewish Congress who died aged 84 in 2013. He is the half-brother of Clare Bronfman, who as a 39-year-old was charged in 2018 in a NXIVM sex-trafficking case.\n\nIn 1979, Bronfman married his first wife, Sherry Brewer, an African-American actress, in New Orleans. Bronfman's father did not approve of the marriage. \"I very much wanted for him to end the relationship, because I told him, all marriages are difficult enough without the added stress of totally different backgrounds\", Bronfman Sr. wrote in his memoirs. \"Sherry offered to convert [to Judaism], which though well intentioned, was not the point.\"\n\nBronfman and Brewer eloped and he and his father remained estranged. The couple had three children before they divorced in 1991:\n\nIn 1993, Bronfman married Clarisa Alcock San Román, a Catholic, the daughter of Frank Alcock Pérez-Matos, a Venezuelan oil executive of half British descent, and Dinorah San Román Strup, her Venezuelan mother. They have four children: Aaron, Bettina, Erik, and Clarissa.\n\nOn January 21, 2011, Bronfman was found guilty in French court of insider trading as Vivendi chief and received a 15-month suspended sentence and a €5m fine.\nConsidering the jail sentences handed out to other executives for similar convictions, BNN reporter Michael Kane told CTV News \"The fact that the judge suspended the jail time could be looked at as getting off lightly, perhaps.\" He has appealed the decision.\n\nAt the height of file sharing service Napster's popularity, Bronfman was a leading opponent of the illegal use of peer-to-peer technology. As CEO of Universal, he helped lead the music industry's opposition to Napster, likening it to slavery and Soviet communism.\n\nIn 2006, WMG was the first major media company to create a business model around user-generated content and, more recently, has been pushing for ways to monetize the popularity of P2P networks on college campuses.\n\nIn late 2006 in an interview with Reuters, Bronfman caused a stir by admitting that his children have copyright infringing music. He claims to have delivered punishment for this but wants it to remain within the realm of the family.\n\nLately, Bronfman may have revised his judgment. During the GSMA Mobile Asia Congress, he told the audience that mobile operators should not make the same mistakes that the music industry has:\n\nIn 2010 Bronfman changed his philosophy on the music industry's online business models, stating that he does not support free advertising supported models. He said that WMG will focus on promoting services that require payment, that will appeal to the population that already pays for downloads in stores such as iTunes.\n\n\n"}

He served as Governor of Atlántico Department from 2008 to 2011, and as Colombian Minister of Environment from 1997 to 1998.\n\nVerano studied Business Administration at the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, graduating in 1973. He continued graduate studies in this university, graduating as a Specialist in Urban Regional Development in 1975. He then moved to New York City in the United States, where he received an MBA from Columbia Business School in 1978.\n\nUpon his return from the United States, Verano started a career as a business administrator, combined with his militancy in the Colombian Liberal Party. Between 1978 and 1984 Verano was appointed manager of \"Cementos del Caribe\", a Colombian cement company. In 1984 he was appointed general manager of the \"Empresa Municipal de Teléfonos de Barranquilla\", the local state owned telephone company of Barranquilla. From 1986 until 1990 Verano was the appointed general manager of the \"Electrificadora del Atlántico\", Barranquilla's state owned electricity company.\n\nIn December 1990, representing the Colombian Liberal Party under the support of Horacio Serpa, Verano ran for a seat in the Constituent Assembly of Colombia and was elected. The Constituent Assembly drafted and approved the Colombian Constitution of 1991.\n\nDuring the mandate of President César Gaviria, Verano was appointed Director of the National Institute of Radio and Television, INRAVISION (\"Instituto Nacional de Radio y Televisión\") in 1992. Between 1992 and 1994 Verano served as general manager of the \"Corporación Eléctrica de la Costa\", Corelca, the electric company that controlled the energy in most of the Caribbean Region of Colombia.\n\nAfter the triumph of Liberal party candidate Ernesto Samper for the presidency of Colombia in 1994, Verano postulated himself for the Mayorship of Barranquilla but was defeated by Edgar George. President Samper then appointed him as Presidential Advisor to the Caribbean Region of Colombia until 1997 when he was then appointed as Minister of Environment in which he served until the end of the Pastrana administration.\n\nIn 1999 Verano was elected by the Liberal Party as Secretary General of the Colombian Liberal Party and later reelected in 2001. During his four years as Secretary General, Verano participated in the association of the party with the Socialist International, he also modernized and pushed forward the internal democratization of the party after the Liberal Constitution of 2000-2003 which concludes with internal elections. After these elections Verano resigned.\n\nIn the internal elections of 2003 to select the candidate for the Governorship of Atlántico Department, Verano ended in second place behind Fernando Borda, who was supported by Senator José Name, despite this Borda was defeated in the general elections. After these elections Verano dedicated himself to private businesses and affairs until 2005. In 2005 Horacio Serpa asked Verano to manage Serpa's third attempt to become president of Colombia, but in May 2006 Serpa ended up third in the presidential race.\n\nVerano then decided to participate in the Colombian regional elections of October 28, 2007 by postulating his name for the Governorship of Atlántico Department. In the internal election of the Colombian Liberal Party Verano was the only candidate for what the president of the Liberal party, Cesar Gaviria decided to cancel the elections, but later Verano was reaffirmed. After this polls showed that Verano had a slightly preference among the opinion and above the other possible candidate José Name. In some polls both candidates were technically in a tie. Verano then received the support of other candidates Jaime Amín, Marieta Morad and Alfredo Palencia that allowed him to gain the support necessary to win. He was scheduled to assume office on January 1, 2008.\n"}
{"id": "6550686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6550686", "title": "Edward H. Ntalami", "text": "Edward H. Ntalami\n\nEdward Haggai Ntalami is a business executive and the former CEO of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) of Kenya, which is an equivalent of the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US or the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the UK. Ntalami is involved in Kenya's capital markets. He has served for over two decades in financial planning and management in the fields of commerce and industry, public sector. Prior to his appointment at the CMA, Ntalami was the Executive Director of Sterling Securities Limited, a local stockbroker. He was appointed Chief Executive, Capital Markets Authority in December 2002 by President Mwai Kibaki. He completed his term in office on 17 December 2007. Seven months after he left Stella Kilonzo became head of CMA.\n\nNtalami was educated at Strathmore University (formerly \"Strathmore College\"), where in 1974 he qualified as a Fellow of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) of the United Kingdom. He took up employment with Housing Finance Company of Kenya (HFCK) Limited then, aged 28, was awarded a three-year scholarship by the Government of Kenya to pursue a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from the University of Sheffield, England. He then returned to his homeland, where in 1979 he qualified as a member of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CPA), Kenya. He died on 20 November 2014 after a long battle with cancer at the age of 67.\n\nIn 1970 he became an audit trainee with the City Council of Nairobi for two years. He later joined Magadi Soda Company (MSC) Limited, a mineral mining company, serving as an Assistant Accountant. After two years at the company, Ntalami joined international audit firm Ernst and Young. He served as a senior audit assistant, then transferred to Housing Finance Company of Kenya (HFCK) Limited, a local real estate financier, as Senior Accountant for three years.\n\nNtalami later served as Chief Accountant, and later, Ag. CEO, for Kenya Airways for four years.\n\nThe early 1980s, which was billed as the golden moment for local indigenous accounting firms, Ntalami became a partner at Kimani Onyancha & Company, a medium size firm of Certified Public Accountants involved primarily in the provision of statutory audits. He held special responsibility for the management consultancy services (MCS).\n\nAfter ten years with KO& Co., he became a stockbroker in 1995. He served as Executive Director for Sterling Securities Limited (SSL), a then fledgling stock broking firm.\n\nHere, Ntalami participated in a number of private and public share issues and flotation, including initial public offerings (IPOs), divestiture, and privatisation of public enterprises. At its peak in 1996, SSL was retained by Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) as a sponsoring broker during its third share issue.\n\nBy 1998 the Sterling Securities Limited partnership was dissolved and, on 11 August 1999, SSL was suspended from trading on the NSE, but later resumed its operations.\n\nFollowing the unexpected restructuring of the stockbroking business, Ntalami left to open and operate a Financial and Investment consultancy firm, Marited Associates. After two years, in December 2002 he was appointed Chief Executive of the Capital Markets Authority by the President replacing Paul. K. Melly, following a major cabinet and public service reshuffle.\n\nA new chairman, Chege Waruinge, the Vice-Chancellor of Gretsa University and Dean Professor Academic Affairs, United States International University (USIU), was also appointed. On 14 January 2009 Waruinge, tendered his resignation to the regulator's board.\n\nNtalami completed his term in office on 17 December 2007, and did not renew his contract. His departure was immediately followed by the exit of Christine Mweti, the Head of Legal Services who was second in command at CMA, who since moved to Renaissance Capital. Stella Kilonzo, was appointed the CMA acting chief executive, and confirmed as CEO on 15 July 2008\n\nSome of the key events that have characterised the Chief Executive's tenure include:\n\nThe Government sold 40 per cent of its stake in the 37-year-old reinsurance firm, or 240 million shares, through an initial public offering (IPO) at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). The IPO opened on 18 July 2007, and closed on 31 July 2007. The IPO was oversubscribed by an average of 363.5 per cent with the retail segment, recording the highest oversubscription of 715 per cent. For the first time ever, the transaction team implemented the delivery versus payment (DVP) method, which allowed institutional investors and insurance firms to hold off payment until the share allocation was completed.\n\nKenya Reinsurance shares closed their first day of trading at KSh15.75. This was 65.78 per cent higher than the share offer price of Sh9.50 a share, a significant gain for shareholders.\n\nOn 20 July 2007, the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) revised the companies listed on its main share index to replace inactive stocks. The 20-Share Index is a reflection of the twenty (20) most actively trading counters in Kenya and was last reviewed in May 2003.\n\nIn the financial sector, ICDCI replaced NIC Bank, while in the industrial sector; KenGen replaced BOC Gases, whose shares were suspended following the proposed merger with Carbacid Investments (see below). In the Agricultural sector, Rea Vipingo replaced Kakuzi, whereas, Mumias Sugar Company replaced Unilever Tea. In the Commercial and Service Sector, CMC replaced Uchumi Supermarkets Limited (under receivership – see below).\n\nThe review of the NSE 20-share index was done to bring on board newly listed firms with active trading track-records and would see the NSE market capitalisation increase substantially with the entry of the profitable firms from the country's fastest growing economic sectors. It is expected that this will give the market a better image, which reflects the true value of the bourse as opposed to retaining less active stocks in the Index. \n\nOn 4 June 2007 the AccessKenya Group was listed on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, becoming the first Information Communication Technology (ICT) company to do so. The web firm, which provides wireless access and email, said the listing for 800 million Kenyan shillings (US$11.9 million) was oversubscribed by 363% with every category, from wealthy investors to institutional investors being fully subscribed.\n\nThe IPO also heralded the creation of a fifth investment segment at the bourse – the technology sector. This is in addition to the already existing agricultural, commercial and services, finance and investment and industrial and allied sectors.\n\nThe shares began trading at Sh14 with 1,000,000 shares changing hands within an hour of the opening bell.\n\nAn attempted takeover bid of Carbacid Investments by BOC Group was aborted after the capital markets regulator declined to endorse the deal. In May 2006, the CMA argued that the latter had not met all the terms it had stated in an offer to Carbacid shareholders. The critical condition in the deal to warrant the takeover and subsequent delisting of Carbacid from the NSE was that at least 80 per cent of Carbacid shareholders had to back the takeover transaction, but only owners holding 71.0 per cent backed the transaction. Ironically, a ruling by the Capital Markets Tribunal okayed the takeover forcing the CMA to appeal against the ruling. Mr Ntalami said the approval of the takeover deal was likely to set a bad precedent that would plunge future takeovers of listed companies into chaos.\n\nThe protracted takeover saga, that has seen the two counters suspended for over four(4) years was resolved in November 2009, as trading in carbon dioxide manufacturer Carbacid shares resumed after suspension since 2005.\n\nOn 11 September 2006 the Nairobi Stock Exchange migrated from the hitherto Open Outcry system to the Automated Trading System (ATS), an electronic trading platform. The President commissioned the new technology on 25 October 2006.\n\nThe change is expected to double the value of shares traded each day on the bourse with enhanced integrity and efficiency. Investors are now able to access current information thus facilitating them to make informed investment decisions on timely basis.\n\nOn 17 December 2007, the NSE completed its migration from the open outcry trading floor method to an all encompassing Wide Area Network (WAN) trading system which allows stockbrokers to trade from the comfort of their offices.\n\nListing and official trading of Equity Bank shares on the NSE commenced on 7 August 2006; a day which saw the price move from Kes. 70 to Kes. 158 in a single price setting deal involving 1000 shares.\n\nOn 17 July 2006, the initial public offering of Scangroup Limited shares kicked off what was to be a historical listing at the NSE. Scangroup, became the first marketing services company in Africa to go public through an IPO. The advertising house, an intelligence-intensive outfit, offloaded 69 million company shares into the capital markets at an offer price of Kes 10.45 per share. The IPO was oversubscribed by 520% and official trading of the company's shares on the NSE) commenced on 29 August 2006.\n\nThe Scangroup share price rose by 39% on its first day of trading to close the day at Kes. 15 with 3, 056,000 shares exchanging hands.\n\nIn April 2006, the Government offloaded 659.51 million shares in Kenya Electric Generating Company (KenGen) through the capital markets. The IPO premiered at the NSE at a discounted price of Kes. 11.90 price before rallying to a high of Sh40, representing a massive fourfold jump. The success of the IPO is credited for spurring the current appetite and excitement for investing in Kenya.\n\nOn 25 April 2007, an intended secondary offer for the shares, in pursuance of the IPO's initial success, was abruptly postponed by former Finance Minister Amos Kimunya attributing the move to the prevailing share price being very low and the bulk tariff conflict between Kengen and KPLC. \n\nOn 23 December 2005, CFCStanbic Bank officially listed 12.0 million new shares, arising out of its successfully completed rights issue. The bank succeeded in raising the Kes. 744 million (US$10 million) needed to align its capital base with Central Bank of Kenya risk management guidelines.\n\nIn October 2005, the retail chain, already facing serious financial challenges, received approval from the CMA for its shareholders to inject an extra Kes. 1.1 billion (US$15 million) through a rights share issue.\n\nIn May 2007, a year after the near-collapse of the retail supermarket, attention shifted to renewed efforts toward the retail chain's tortuous recovery strategy. The company's receiver-managers, led by Mr Jonanthan Ciano, offered shareholders yet another chance to inject Sh800 million (U.S$. 11.4 million) into the company under a new recapitalisation plan. Analysts then observed that were the plan to fail due to shareholder reluctance, the retail chain would have to find a new equity partner to fund its recovery.\n\nThe highly successful Kenya Commercial Bank rights issue in September 2004, mobilised in excess of Kes. 2.3 billion (US$31 million) needed for the bank's growth strategy. The rights offer for 50 million shares at a price of Kshs 49.00, was oversubscribed by 12.25%, necessitating a refund of Kes. 310 million (US$4.1million) to applicants following shortage of untaken rights for allotment.\n\n\nPrevious Chief Executives of the CMA (Kenya), include (a) William Chelashaw, who served from 1992 until 1997 and (b) Paul K.

{"id": "2371270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2371270", "title": "Egmore", "text": "Egmore\n\nEgmore is a neighbourhood of Chennai, India. Situated on the northern banks of the Coovum River, Egmore is an important residential area as well as a commercial and transportation hub. The Egmore Railway Station was the main terminus of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway and later, the metre gauge section of the Southern division of the Indian Railways. It continues to be an important railway junction. The Government Museum, Chennai is also situated in Egmore. Other important institutions based in Egmore include the Government Women and Children's Hospital, the Tamil Nadu State Archives and the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department. The Wesley Church, Egmore is the oldest church of the region.\n\nThe earliest references to Egmore occur in the inscriptions of the Chola king Kulothunga I.Under the Chola Empire, Egmore was the headquarters of an administrative division or \"Nadu\" called Elumbur Nadu. An inscription of the Nellore Chola king Vijaya Kanda Gopal dated 2 September 1264 speaks of a village in Elumur-Tudarmuni Nadu in Pulal Kottam. A Vijayanagar period inscription of Sriranganatha Yadavaraya records an endowment to a monastery in Thiruvottriyur by a resident of Serruppedu (identified with the present day Chetpet) in Elumur-Tudarmuni Nadu. \n\nEgmore is the Anglicised form of \"Ezhumbur\", the name of a pre-British era village situated on the northern banks of the River.\nDespite the fact that Egmore had been a part of the East India Company's possessions since 1720, it was not until the \"Golden age of British rule\" stretching from 1858 to 1947 that Egmore witnessed some real growth. The Egmore Museum was one of the first notable monuments to be constructed here. The construction of this famous landmark was undertaken immediately after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. The Connemara Library was created as an annex housing the Museum's vast book collection and became operational in 1896.\n\nEgmore, in 1796, was the site of the Military Male Orphan Asylum near Madras. This asylum was headed by Andrew Bell, who invented the Madras System for schooling there.\n\n\n\n\nEgmore has been a stronghold for Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), ever since the party's creation. Other than barely losing to Congress in 1962 election, it has consistently voted for DMK, even during times of low popularity for the DMK. However it is worth noting, that recently the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK), have made significant in-grounds, like they have in many localities around Chennai, which used to be DMK strongholds. Egmore is also 1 of the two total constituents won by DMK in 1991 election. This constituent is reserved for scheduled caste. This is also the first MLA seat held by K Anbazhagan, when he won it in 1957 election.\n\nEgmore assembly constituency is part of Chennai Central (Lok Sabha constituency).\n\nEgmore Railway Station is the second most important in the state of Tamil Nadu after the Chennai Central Railway Station. It was constructed in 1908 and functioned as the headquarters of the now defunct Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway till 1951.\n\nEgmore is well connected to other parts of the city. Many of the state-run Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses run through Egmore. Egmore has its own suburban train station on the Chennai Beach - Tambaram railway line, which connects it to other parts of the city.\n\n"}

The retail environments he created were destinations, rather than simply places to buy clothes; his New York store was known by some as the daytime Studio 54 and gave space to artists and creatives – including Andy Warhol.\n\nFiorucci is credited with designing and popularising stretch jeans, and for transforming the fashion scene. Giorgio Armani described him as a revolutionary, adding: \"He was always ready to take some risks to really understand his time\".\n\nElio Fiorucci was born in Milan and was one of six children, two of them boys. The family escaped to the countryside during the war, returning afterwards to continue running the family shoe shop and manufacturing business.\n\nFiorucci started working in his father's shop when he was 14, becoming a full-time worker there at 17. In 1962, Fiorucci created his first successful design – a brightly coloured waterproof overshoe. The design was featured in the Italian magazine \"Amica\" and earned him enough money to go travelling. His travels included a visit to London, then a hotbed of young fashion, and he was said to have been surprised and also influenced by the dynamic retailing approaches found in Carnaby Street and Kensington Market. Later he would say: \"That creative chaos represented a new deal, free from the pressures of formal dressing and elegance\".\n\nAfter returning to Milan, he opened his first shop in 1967. This was located in the Galleria Passarella and targeted a much younger clientele than was typical for Italian retailing of the time. Fiorucci stocked London designers such as Ossie Clark, as well as the typical hippie uniform of Afghan coat. The store became an eclectic mix of eccentricities – everything from rag rugs and kettles to hair products and clothing.\n\nThe exotic market-style approach he'd seen in Kensington Market was added to, with Fiorucci using the fashion inspiration he'd gained in his travels to places such as Mexico and Ibiza, as well as being inspired by the London scene.\n\nHe created his own label in 1970. While he was considerably older than his target market – the teenage and young shopper – he employed young fashion scouts internationally to report back on what young people were wearing and discover different products and designs that could be incorporated into his manufacturing. The distinctive logo he chose for Fiorucci was two less than saintly looking Victorian cherubs in sunglasses. The clothing he manufactured was affordable and often kitsch – such as bright coloured T-shirts featuring his trademark cherub motif or Disney characters.\n\nThe store was distinctively different and radical for the time and grew to become what Fiorucci himself would describe as: \"an amusement park of novelties\". A second store opened in Milan's Via Torino – it included a fast-food restaurant and became a place for young people to see and be seen. By this stage, Fiorucci had financial backing from the Montedison group.\n\nIn 1976, the Fiorucci brand was taken to New York, with a retail store on East 59th Street. Its interior was part designed by Ettore Sottsass and it became part of the ascendent disco culture – the opening party was held at Studio 54 and Fiorucci chartered a jumbo jet to fly in his Italian guests. Like his Milan stores, this became a place for people to hang out and the store offered free espresso and music from resident DJs – it became known as the daytime Studio 54 because of the disco crowd that gathered there.\n\nFiorucci became friendly with Andy Warhol and gave him a free office in the store in order to set up \"Interview\". Warhol described the store as fun, saying: \"That's all I ever wanted, all plastic\". Fiorucci also offered wall space to artist Keith Haring and gave retail concessions to designers Anna Sui and Betsey Johnson. Famous patrons included Elizabeth Taylor, Jackie Onassis and Cher, and the teenage Marc Jacobs also spent time there.\n\nThe expansion, which had begun in 1975, continued apace. By 1984, the brand had stores on London's King's Road and LA's Rodeo Drive, as well as branches in Sydney, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Its Milan store would attract up to 10,000 visitors on a Saturday at the peak of its success. For a while, Elio Fiorucci's reach appeared unstoppable – he said: \"we were never wrong\" – but he struggled to manage the company's financial affairs. In 1981 Benetton bought Montedison's share in the company, selling it on to Aknofin six years later. Also in 1986, the New York store was forced to close, followed by other international outlets and the company went into administration.\n\nThe Fiorucci label was sold to the Carrera jeans label, which sold it on in 1990 to the Japanese firm Edwin International. Fiorucci retained creative control under Edwin, but the relationship was not smooth. His original Fiorucci store in Milan closed in 2003. The New York store closed in the same year, having moved downtown and – in post 9/11 New York – become a space that sponsored and supported new artists. AndrewAndrew used the shop to launch their careers.\n\nAfter the Fiorucci brand, Elio Fiorucci launched a new fashion label Love Therapy, which included jeans, hoodies, clothes and accessories. Five years after its launch, a licensing deal was agreed with Coin Group, with both women's and children's ranges being sold in branches of the retailer Oviesse.\n\nIt has been said that garments were the least important part of Fiorucci's success. Instead, it was the retail ambience and branding – he was an early adopter of the outrageous advertising campaign and even had the stickers for one monokini campaign seized by the Italian police.\n\nHis most significant introductions was in jeans, which he cut close to the body and to fit women's shape. From 1982, his denims incorporated lycra, and he also made jeans in other materials, including vinyl. The skintight – almost spray-on – look he created was said to have been inspired by the sight of women in Ibiza in wet jeans; Fiorucci, having noted that they fitted women's bodies better when wet, decided to recreate the effect, and his designs left little to the imagination.\n\nHe helped to popularise animal prints in 1970s and early '80s fashion – his trademark was leopard-print – although he himself was a vegetarian and never used leather in his jeans or other garments.\n\nFiorucci's influence on the disco scene was strong; his New York art director also styled the then rising star Madonna. Later, at the brand's 15th anniversary party in Studio 54, it was Madonna who agreed to jump out of the birthday cake. Fiorucci's brand had a name check – alongside Halston and Gucci – in the Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers song \"He's the Greatest Dancer\", a disco anthem sung by Sister Sledge.\n\nAn obituary on the BBC Radio 4 programme \"Last Word\" (first broadcast on 18 August 2015) interviewed fashion curator at the Victoria & Albert Museum Sonnet Stanfill, who suggested Elio Fiorucci helped to make fashion a lot less formal – transforming jeans into fashion that could be worn day or evening. She added that his design skills encompassed not just fashion but also retail environment and marketing materials, which combined to make the garments more compelling. Graphic designer Terry Jones suggested that his approach had a direct influence on fashion brands that followed, such as Dolce & Gabbana and Moschino.\n\nDespite the flamboyance of the clothes and retail environments he created, Fiorucci's personal style was restrained – typically sweater and trousers – and he told \"WWD\" in 1976, in an interview about the opening of his Manhattan store that he was: \"a merchant, not a man of fashion\". He married twice and had three daughters.\n\n"}

It was one of the Baltimore garment industry's major employers.\n\nThe company mostly manufactured pajamas and nightwear, leading to their slogan, \"The Nightwear of a Nation\". They were the first manufacturer to use elastic in the waist of pajama pants, rather than drawstrings or belts.\n\nThe company was best known at the time for its jingle \"My Faultless Pajama Girl\". This piece, a fox-trot, was composed by Louis Fisher in 1917. Sheet music was published by Jerome H Remick & Co.\n\nThe company was sold to fellow garment manufacturer Wilson Brothers in the 1940s. Wilson Brothers continued to produce pajamas under the Faultless Pajama name in addition to their own Wilson Wear line.\n\nThe building in which the company was located is part of the Loft Historic District North, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 as the Rosenfeld Building. The building was converted to loft-style apartments in the 1980s and is currently known as the Inner Harbor Loft Apartments.

The fund is structured as a pledge fund based on annual commitments, with deals sourced through Lepe's business contacts.Lepe's portfolio includes: Pharmacy2U, Boat International Media, CreativeLive, Masabi, and Festicket. The fund successfully exited its investment in Wahanda (now Treatwell) in 2015, following a sale of the business to Recruit Holding. Lepe has advised on investment deals for News Corp, Ministry of Sound and TalkTalk.\n\nIn 2006 Goodwin and Hoberman created Founders Forum, an invitation-only network for digital entrepreneurs, corporate CEOs and senior investors. The Forum has 1500 members and has become known as a Europe-based equivalent of Sun Valley, the Allen & Co retreat for media executives in the US. Speakers and attendees at previous Forum meetings include Sir Richard Branson, Arianna Huffington, Eric Schmidt, Reid Hoffman, Sean Parker, Niklas Zennstrom, Mikitani Hiroshi, Ben Horowitz, Natalie Massenet, Charles Dunstone, Tony Fadell, Natalie Vodianova, Jessica Alba, Peter Gabriel, Ashton Kutcher, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Daniel Ek and Ari Emanuel.\n\nEvents are currently held in London, Paris, Madrid, Istanbul, Los Angeles, New York City, Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai, New Delhi, Qingdao and Singapore. In 2013 the \"Financial Times\" announced a media partnership with the Forum, presenting two awards at that year's London event.\n\nAlso in 2013, Founders Forum and the British Government's UK Trade & Investment arm created the Technology Innovators' Forum (TIF-IN), which connects new UK businesses with influential heads of content, media and finance companies worldwide.\n\nIn 2009 Goodwin, Hoberman and other partners co-founded PROfounders Capital, an early stage fund backed by entrepreneurs for digital entrepreneurs. One of its first investments was UK-based TweetDeck, the online application sold two years later to Twitter for $40m.\n\nFounders Forum has launched a number of initiatives under the Founders aegis, including the executive search arm Founders Keepers and the strategic consultancy Founders Intelligence.\n\nIn June 2015 Goodwin co-launched Founders Pledge, a UK- and US-registered charity to enable tech entrepreneurs to commit to donating at least 2% of their personal proceeds to philanthropic causes upon exit. Founders Pledge's declared mission is to \"...strip down the barriers to charitable giving, making it easy for technology entrepreneurs to give back to society.\" The Pledge's service is paid for by sponsors, partners, and private donors, and is offered free to entrepreneurs. Founders Pledge also offers post-exit support, including charity sourcing, due diligence and impact reporting. \n\nAt launch, £18.5m was pledged by leaders of 50 UK technology companies, including Alex Depledge of Hassle.com, José Neves of Farfetch, Ben Medlock from SwiftKey and James Alexander of Zopa. Founder's Pledge has facilitated the giving of $15.5 million to charities of donors' choices and has secured a further $180 million in legally binding pledges.  \n\nIn March 2016 Founders Pledge launched Founders of the Future, a philanthropic initiative that uses artificial intelligence and recommendations to uncover entrepreneurial talent in the 15–35 age group who are not currently founders.   \n\nFounders Pledge has also entered partnerships with US seed accelerators MassChallenge and Y Combinator, to obtain pledges from their funded companies. \n\nGoodwin joined with Hoberman and lastminute.com co-founder Martha Lane Fox to develop the Founders Forum Foundation. The Foundation facilitates internships and scholarships to school-leavers from across the UK, to break down the barriers that Goodwin believes result in the majority of media and tech company leaders coming from privileged backgrounds. Goodwin also believes entrepreneurship can address the problems faced by young people, especially \"NEETs\" (\"not in employment, education or training\").\n\nGoodwin is disparaging of large tech firms for not doing enough to engage with the UK communities in which they operate, and for failing to paying enough tax: “We should be leaning on them harder to put more back into the country,” he told \"The Telegraph\" newspaper. “I’m not talking about complicated tax structures – we need to [encourage them] to put more back into the cities they're a part of. We're sometimes so afraid of our own shadow that they'll go somewhere else, but where are they going to go? If you want a [European] headquarters, London is the best place to be.\"\n\nIn 2012 Founders Forum announced the launch of Founders Forum For Good. Led by Martha Lane-Fox and with Board members including Goodwin, Jimmy Wales and Mike Lynch, Founders Forum for Good's mission is to bring together digital entrepreneurs with the leaders of social and environmental organisations to tackle social issues and inequalities. In June 2013 the following year the Forum partnered with Nominet Trust to launch Social Tech, Social Change, a £1m fund providing early-stage finance for social entrepreneurs.\n\nGoodwin is married to Flora Hesketh, the daughter of Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh, the former Conservative Party treasurer.\n\nGoodwin's hobbies include sailing. In 2012 he campaigned the J/109 \"Harlequin\", becoming the overall winner at Cowes Week 2012 for both the White Group, J/109 group, and Cowes Week overall.\n\n"}

On August 6, 2018, Larry Ellison published a letter announcing that he will be joining Kosmos as an investor.\n\nKosmos partnership with the International Tennis Federation to revamp the Davis Cup has been criticized by the tennis community. Many claim that the partnership will take away from the traditions of the 118-year-old tennis event. In a secret meeting held in Orlando, Florida, on August 16, 2018, the changes proposed by Kosmos received a 71 percent approval at the International Tennis Federation annual general meeting. Proposals require a two-thirds majority to pass. While France and USA voice strong support for the changes and voted in favor of the move, others, such as Australia, were against the new format.\n\nAfter the vote, French player Nicolas Mahut tweeted, \"The Davis Cup died, and a part of the history of our sport flew away for a handful of dollars\". Other players on the circuit including Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, and Rafael Nadal have publicly supported the new idea. Lleyton Hewitt of Australia strongly opposes the new initiative as an erosion of the 100-year-old tradition of the Davis Cup.\n"}

{"id": "8570918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8570918", "title": "Nuclear Energy Institute", "text": "Nuclear Energy Institute\n\nThe Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) is a nuclear industry trade association in the United States of America, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to its website, the NEI \"develops policy on key legislative and regulatory issues affecting the industry. NEI then serves as a unified industry voice before the U.S. Congress, executive branch agencies and federal regulators, as well as international organizations and venues. NEI also provides a forum to resolve technical and business issues for the industry. Finally, NEI provides accurate and timely information on the nuclear industry to members, policymakers, the news media and the public.\" In practice, this takes the form of representing the nuclear industry's interests before Congress and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as serving as an industry think tank in order to influence public policy.\n\nThe nuclear energy industry that NEI represents and serves includes: Commercial electricity generation, nuclear medicine including diagnostics and therapy, food processing and agricultural applications, industrial and manufacturing applications, uranium mining and processing, nuclear fuel and radioactive materials manufacturing, transportation of radioactive materials, and nuclear waste management\n\nNEI is governed by a 47-member board of directors. The board includes representatives from the nation's 27 nuclear utilities, plant designers, architect/engineering firms and fuel cycle companies. Eighteen members of the board serve on the executive committee, which is responsible for NEI's business and policy affairs.\n\nNEI was founded in 1994 from the merger of several nuclear energy industry organizations, the oldest of which was created in 1953. Specifically, in 1994, NEI was formed from the merger of the Nuclear Utility Management and Resources Council (NUMARC), which addressed generic regulatory and technical issues; the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness (USCEA), which conducted a national communications program; the American Nuclear Energy Council (ANEC), which conducted government affairs; and the nuclear division of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), which handled issues involving used nuclear fuel management, nuclear fuel supply, and the economics of nuclear energy. In 1987, NUMARC and USCEA were created through a division of the Atomic Industrial Forum (AIF). USCEA was founded in 1979 as the U.S. Committee for Energy Awareness. AIF was created in 1953 to focus on the beneficial uses of nuclear energy. This was two years before the international “Atoms for Peace” conference held in Geneva in 1955, marking the dawn of the nuclear age.\n\nIn addition to its core mission, NEI also sponsors a number of public communications efforts to build support for the industry and the expansion of nuclear energy, a number of which have come under attack from environmentalists and anti-nuclear activists. In 2006, NEI founded the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition (CASEnergy) to help build local support around the country for new nuclear construction. The co-chairs of the coalition are Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore and former United States Environmental Protection Agency Secretary and New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman. As of April 2006, CASEnergy boasted 427 organizations and 454 individuals as members.\n\nIn April 2004, the Austin Chronicle reported that NEI has hired the Potomac Communications Group to ghostwrite pro-nuclear op-ed columns to be submitted to local newspapers under the name of local residents. In 2003 story in the Columbus Dispatch, NEI said that it engaged a public affairs agency to identify individuals with technical expertise in the nuclear energy industry to participate in the public debate. However, as many of these individuals have little experience in opinion writing for a non-technical audience, the agency provides assistance if requested, a common industry practice.\n\nIn 1999, Public Citizen filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission charging that an NEI advertising campaign overstated the environmental benefits of nuclear energy to consumers living in markets where sales of electricity had been deregulated. In a ruling the following December, the FTC rejected those claims concluding: NEI did not violate the law; agreed that the advertisements were directed to policymakers and opinion leaders in forums that principally reach those who set national policy on energy and environmental issues, and therefore did not constitute \"commercial speech\"; noted that in different circumstances, such as direct marketing of electricity, such advertising could be considered commercial speech and be subject to stricter substantiation.\n\nNEI ran other ads with similar content, most recently one released in September 2006 touting nuclear energy's non-emitting character and the role it can play in reducing American dependence on foreign sources of fossil fuels like oil and natural gas.\n\nIn 2008, Greenpeace criticised NEI's public relations efforts and suggested that NEI's advertising about nuclear power was an example of greenwashing. In the first quarter of 2008, NEI spent $320,000 on lobbying the US federal government. Besides Congress, the nuclear group lobbied the White House, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy and others in the first three months of the year. The NEI spent $1.3 million to lobby the federal government in 2007.\n\nIn 2012, NEI quoted Kathyrn Higley, professor of radiation health physics in the department of nuclear engineering at Oregon State University, who described the health impact of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident to be \"really, really minor\", adding that \"the Japanese government was able to effectively block a large component of exposure in this population\".\n\n\n\n"}

He continued at the school for university, graduating in 1970 with a degree in business administration, with the aim of returning to his home state to be an entrepreneur. He chose to study at the Tec because of its educational model and the respect held in Zacatecas for the industry in Monterrey. One of his aims in high school was to meet the Tec founder Eugenio Garza Sada which he was able to do.\n\nIn the very early 1980s, Guillermo Jones Pereda, Juan De Santiago Ortega and Reimers founded Cerámica Santo Niño, today known as Cesantoni. The business began by making ceramic tiles but has since branched out into other ceramic products. The traditional means of making tile in Mexico requires two firings, but he decided to work to find a way to create the product in one firing, succeeding by the end of the 1980s. In 1998, the company worked to automate the process as much as possible, which included replacing many of the existing facilities. Much of the work is now done by robots. The plant works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and is an important source of employment in the state, not only in the plants but also through its demand for raw materials from mines in the state of Zacatecas.\n\nHe has been quoted as saying that making more money is not the purpose of life, but rather go beyond what already exists. In 1985, Reimers was approached by his alma mater to organize and find resources to found a campus of Tec de Monterrey in Zacatecas. A short time later, he became an advisor to the new institution.

Carey has won the Miles Franklin Award three times and is frequently named as Australia's next contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Carey is one of only four writers to have won the Booker Prize twice—the others being J. G. Farrell, J. M. Coetzee and Hilary Mantel. Carey won his first Booker Prize in 1988 for \"Oscar and Lucinda\", and won for the second time in 2001 with \"True History of the Kelly Gang\". In May 2008 he was nominated for the Best of the Booker Prize.\n\nIn addition to writing fiction, he collaborated on the screenplay of the film \"Until the End of the World\" with Wim Wenders and is executive director of the Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing program at Hunter College, part of the City University of New York.\n\nPeter Carey was born in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, in 1943. His parents ran a General Motors dealership, Carey Motors. He attended Bacchus Marsh State School from 1948 to 1953, then boarded at Geelong Grammar School between 1954 and 1960. In 1961, Carey enrolled in a science degree at the new Monash University in Melbourne, majoring in chemistry and zoology, but cut his studies short because of a car accident and a lack of interest. It was at university that he met his first wife, Leigh Weetman, who was studying German and philosophy, and who also dropped out.\n\nIn 1962, he began to work in advertising. He was employed by various Melbourne agencies between 1962 and 1967, including on campaigns for Volkswagen and Lindeman's Wine. His advertising work brought him into contact with older writers who introduced him to recent European and American fiction: \"I didn't really start getting an education until I worked in advertising with people like Barry Oakley and Morris Lurie—and Bruce Petty had an office next door.\"\n\nDuring this time, he read widely, particularly the works of Samuel Beckett, William Faulkner, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, and Gabriel García Márquez, and began writing on his own, receiving his first rejection slip in 1964, the same year he married Weetman. Over the next few years he wrote five novels—\"Contacts\" (1964–1965), \"Starts Here, Ends Here\" (1965–1967), \"The Futility Machine\" (1966–1967), \"Wog\" (1969), and \"Adventures on Board the Marie\" [sic] \"Celeste\" (1971). None of them were published. Sun Books accepted \"The Futility Machine\" but did not proceed with publication, and \"Adventures on Board the Marie Celeste\" was accepted by Outback Press before being withdrawn by Carey himself. These and other unpublished manuscripts from the period—including twenty-one short stories—are now held by the Fryer Library at the University of Queensland.\n\nCarey's only publications during the 1960s were \"Contacts\" (a short extract from the unpublished novel of the same name, in \"Under Twenty-Five: An Anthology\", 1966) and \"She Wakes\" (a short story, in \"Australian Letters\", 1967). Towards the end of the decade, Carey and Weetman abandoned Australia with \"a certain degree of self-hatred\", travelling through Europe and Iran before settling in London in 1968, where Carey continued to write highly regarded advertising copy and unpublished fiction.\n\nReturning to Australia in 1970, Carey once again did advertising work in Melbourne and Sydney. He also kept writing, and gradually broke through with editors, publishing short stories in magazines and newspapers such as \"Meanjin\" and \"Nation Review\". Most of these were collected in his first book, \"The Fat Man In History\", which appeared in 1974. In the same year Carey moved to Balmain in Sydney to work for Grey Advertising.\n\nIn 1976, Carey moved to Queensland and joined an alternative community named Starlight in Yandina, north of Brisbane, with his new partner, the painter Margot Hutcheson, with whom he lived in the 1970s and 1980s. He remained with Grey, writing in Yandina for three weeks, then spending the fourth week at the agency in Sydney. It was during this time that he produced most of the stories collected in \"War Crimes\" (1979), as well as \"Bliss\" (1981), his first published novel.\n\nCarey started his own advertising agency in 1980, the Sydney-based McSpedden Carey Advertising Consultants, in partnership with Bani McSpedden. After many years of separation, Leigh Weetman asked for a divorce in 1980 so that she could remarry and Peter agreed. In 1981, he moved to Bellingen in northern New South Wales. There he wrote \"Illywhacker\", published in 1985. In the same year he married theatre director Alison Summers. \"Illusion\", a stage musical Carey wrote with Mike Mullins and composer Martin Armiger, was performed at the 1986 Adelaide Festival of the Arts and a studio cast recording of the musical was nominated for a 1987 ARIA Award (for which Carey as lyricist was nominated).\n\nThe decade—and the Australian phase of Carey's career—culminated with the publication of \"Oscar and Lucinda\" (1988), which won the Booker McConnell Prize (as it was then known) and brought the author international recognition. Carey explained that the novel was inspired, in part, by his time in Bellingen:\n\nCarey sold his share of McSpedden Carey and in 1990 moved with Alison Summers and their son to New York, where he took a job teaching creative writing at New York University. He later said that New York would not have been his first choice of place to live, and that moving there was his wife's idea. Carey and Summers divorced in 2005 after a four-year separation. Carey is now married to the British-born publisher Frances Coady.\n\n\"The Tax Inspector\" (1991), begun in Australia, was the first book he completed in the United States. It was followed by \"The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith\" (1994), a fable in which he explored the relationship between Australia and America, disguised in the novel as \"Efica\" and \"Voorstand\". This is a relationship that has preoccupied him throughout his career, going back to \"Bliss\" (1981), \"Illywhacker\" (1985), and the early short stories. Nevertheless, Carey continued to set his fiction primarily in Australia and remained diffident about writing explicitly on American themes. In a piece on \"True History of the Kelly Gang\" (2001), Mel Gussow reported that:\n\nIt was only after nearly two decades in the United States that he embarked on \"Parrot and Olivier in America\" (2010), loosely based on events in the life of Alexis de Tocqueville. Carey says \"Tocqueville opened a door I could enter. I saw the present in the past. It was accessible, imaginable.\" Carey continues to extend his canvas; in his most recent novel, \"The Chemistry of Tears\" (2012), \"contemporary London is brought intimately in touch with ... a 19th-century Germany redolent of the Brothers Grimm\".\n\nIn 1998, Carey was accused of snubbing Queen Elizabeth II by declining an invitation to meet her after winning the Commonwealth Writers Prize for \"Jack Maggs\" (1997). While Carey is a republican, in the Australian sense, he insists that no offence was intended:\n\nThe meeting did eventually take place, with the Queen remarking, according to Carey, \"I believe you had a little trouble getting here.\"\n\nThe unhappy circumstances of Carey's break-up with Alison Summers received publicity (largely in Australia) in 2006 when \"\" appeared, depicting the toxic relationship between its protagonist, Butcher Bones, and his ex-wife, known only as \"the Plaintiff\".\n\nIn April 2015 he, alongside Michael Ondaatje, Francine Prose, Teju Cole, Rachel Kushner and Taiye Selasi, withdrew from the PEN American Center gala honouring the French satirical magazine \"Charlie Hebdo\" with its \"Freedom of Expression Courage\" award. He stated that one of his reasons for doing so was \"PEN’s seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population.\". In addition, 204 PEN members, including Teju Cole and Deborah Eisenberg, wrote to PEN, objecting to its decision to give the award to Charlie Hebdo.\n\nCarey has been awarded three honorary degrees. He has been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (1989), an Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (2001), a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2003), and a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2016), which has also awarded him its Harold D Vursell Memorial Award (2012). In 2010, he appeared on two Australian postage stamps in a series dedicated to \"Australian Legends\". On 11 June 2012, Carey was named an Officer of the Order of Australia for \"distinguished service to literature as a novelist, through international promotion of the Australian identity, as a mentor to emerging writers.\" And in 2014, Carey was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (honoris causa) by Sydney University.\n\nCarey has won numerous literary awards, including:\n\n\nStories from Carey's first two collections have been repackaged in \"The Fat Man in History and Other Stories\" (1980), \"Exotic Pleasures\" (1990), and \"Collected Stories\" (1994); the last also includes three previously uncollected stories: \"Joe\" (\"Australian New Writing\", 1973), \"A Million Dollars Worth of Amphetamines\" (\"Nation Review\", 1975), and \"Concerning the Greek Tyrant\" (\"The Tabloid Story Pocket Book\", 1978).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kennedy, and the senators Robert F. Kennedy and Edward Kennedy. From the 1940s to the 1960s, he was a well-known celebrity and starred in a number of highly acclaimed films. In later years, he was noted more for his off-screen activities as a celebrity than for his acting; it was said that he was \"famous for being famous\".\n\nBorn in London in 1923, he was the only child of Lieutenant General Sir Sydney Turing Barlow Lawford, KBE (1865–1953) and May Sommerville Bunny (1883–1972). At the time of Peter's birth, however, his mother was married to Lieutenant colonel Dr Ernest Vaughn Aylen D.S.O, one of Sir Sydney's officers, while his father was married to Muriel Williams. At the time, May and Ernest Aylen were living apart. May confessed to Aylen that the child was not his, a revelation that resulted in a double divorce. Sydney and May wed in September 1924 after their divorces were finalised and when their son was one year old.\n\nLawford's family was connected to the English aristocracy through his uncle Ernest Lawford's wife (a daughter of the 14th Earl of Eglinton) as well as his aunt Ethel Turner Lawford (who married a son of the 1st Baron Avebury). His aunt, Jessie Bruce Lawford, another of his father's sisters, was the second wife of the Hon Hartley Williams, senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court of the colony of Victoria, Australia. A relative, through his mother, was Australian artist Rupert Bunny. \n\nHe spent his early childhood in France and, owing to his family's travels, was never formally educated. Instead, he was schooled by governesses and tutors, and his education included tennis and ballet lessons. \"In the beginning,\" his mother observed, \"he had no homework. When he was older he had Spanish, German and music added to his studies. He read only selected books: English fairy stories, English and French classics; no crime stories. Having studied Peter for so long, I decided he was quite unfitted for any career except art, so I cut Latin, Algebra, high mathematics and substituted dramatics instead.\" Because of the widely varying national and religious backgrounds of his tutors, Lawford \"attended various services in churches, cathedrals, synagogues and for some time was an usher in a Christian Science Sunday School...\" Around 1930, aged seven, he made his acting debut in the English film \"Poor Old Bill\".\n\nAt the age of 14, Lawford severely injured his right arm in an accident when it went through a glass door. The injury greatly compromised the use of his lower arm and hand with irreversible nerve damage, which he later learned to hide. The injury was judged to be serious enough to prevent his entrance into the armed forces, which his parents had planned. Instead, Lawford decided to pursue a career as an actor, a decision that resulted in one of his aunts refusing to leave him her considerable fortune, as originally planned.\n\nLawford's first film role was at age seven in the British film \"Poor Old Bill\".\n\nPrior to the Second World War, Lawford was offered a contract by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In 1938, he made his Hollywood debut in a minor part in the film \"Lord Jeff\". His first role in a major film production was in \"A Yank at Eton\" (1942), starring Mickey Rooney, in which Lawford played a snobbish bully. He had uncredited roles as a pilot in \"Mrs. Miniver\" (1942) and as a sailor in \"Sherlock Holmes Faces Death\" (1943).\n\nIn June 1943, MGM signed Lawford to a long-term contract. His first role under this was \"The White Cliffs of Dover\" (1944), in which he played a young soldier during the Second World War. MGM gave him another important role in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" (1945). Lawford's first leading role came in \"Son of Lassie\" (1945), and he later won a \"Modern Screen\" magazine readers' poll as the most popular actor in Hollywood of 1946. His fan mail jumped to thousands of letters a week.\n\nWith actors such as Clark Gable and James Stewart away at war, Lawford was recognised as a new romantic lead on the MGM lot. Lawford's busiest year as an actor was 1946, when two of his films opened within days of each other: \"Cluny Brown\" and \"Two Sisters from Boston\". He made his first comedy film that year, \"My Brother Talks to Horses\" (released in 1947). He appeared with Frank Sinatra for the first time in the musical \"It Happened in Brooklyn\" (1947). Lawford received rave reviews for his work in the film, while Sinatra's were lukewarm.\n\nLawford later admitted that the most terrifying experience of his career was the first musical number he performed in the musical \"Good News\" (1947). Using an American accent for his role, he won acclaim as a performer. Over the next few years, he was given supporting roles in MGM films, including \"On an Island with You\" (1948), \"Easter Parade\" (1948), \"Little Women\" (1949), \"Royal Wedding\" (1951) and \"You for Me\" (1952).\n\nLawford's first film after Metro released him and several other players from their contracts was the comedy \"It Should Happen to You\", wherein he starred alongside Judy Holliday and Jack Lemmon. In 1959, Sinatra invited Lawford to join the \"Rat Pack\" and also got him a role in \"Never So Few\". The casino caper \"Ocean's 11\" (1960) was a project Lawford first brought to Sinatra's attention. Other films included the acclaimed Israeli-set drama \"Exodus\" (1960); \"The Longest Day\" (1962), a war film with a star-studded cast; and the political drama \"Advise & Consent\" (1962) (in which he played a United States Senator). He reunited with the Rat Pack for the western adventure \"Sergeants 3\".\n\nIn 1961, Lawford and his manager Milt Ebbins formed \"Chrislaw Productions\", which was named after Peter's son Christopher, and produced the 1963 action film \"Johnny Cool\" starring Henry Silva and Elizabeth Montgomery. He went on to produce the 1965 Patty Duke film \"Billie\" as well as two films with Sammy Davis, Jr., \"Salt and Pepper\" and \"One More Time\". He returned to MGM for \"They Only Kill Their Masters\" (1972), which reunited him with several former MGM contract players. His last role was as Montague Chippendale in \"Where Is Parsifal?\" (1983).\n\nLawford made his television debut in 1953 in a guest-starring role on Ronald Reagan's anthology series \"General Electric Theater\". In 1954, he starred as a newspaper advice-to-the-lovelorn columnist named Bill Hastings in the short-lived NBC series \"Dear Phoebe\" with Marcia Henderson and Charles Lane.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1959, Lawford co-starred with Phyllis Kirk in \"The Thin Man\", an NBC series from MGM based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett. He had a recurring role on \"The Doris Day Show\" from 1971 to 1973 as the love interest to Day's character. \n\nLawford guest-starred on various television series, including \"The Doris Day Show\", \"The Martha Raye Show\", \"Schlitz Playhouse of Stars\", \"Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"The Wild Wild West\", \"The Virginian\", \"Bewitched\", \"The Patty Duke Show\", \"The Love Boat\", \"Fantasy Island\" and \"The Bob Cummings Show\". \n\nAside from guest spots, he also guest-starred on variety shows, such as \"The Judy Garland Show\" and \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\", and game shows, such as \"What's My Line?\", \"Password\" and \"Pyramid\".\n\nHis first marriage, in 1954, was to socialite Pat Kennedy, a younger sister of then-US Senator John F. Kennedy (D-MA). They had four children: a son, actor and author Christopher Lawford (1955−2018), and daughters Sydney Maleia Lawford (b. 1956), Victoria Francis Lawford (b. 1958), and Robin Elizabeth Lawford (b. 1961).\n\nLawford became an American citizen on 23 April 1960. He had prepared for this in time to vote for his brother-in-law in the upcoming presidential election. Lawford, along with other members of the \"Rat Pack\", helped campaign for Kennedy and the Democratic Party. Sinatra famously dubbed him \"Brother-in-Lawford\" at this time. Lawford and Patricia Kennedy divorced in February 1966.\n\nLawford was originally cast as Alan A. Dale in the film \"Robin and the 7 Hoods\" but was replaced by Bing Crosby following a break in Sinatra's relationship with Lawford. The break stemmed from a scheduled visit to Sinatra's home by Lawford's brother-in-law, President Kennedy, during a 1962 West Coast trip. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was long concerned about Sinatra's rumoured ties with underworld figures, encouraged the President to change his plans and stay at Crosby's home, which (it was maintained) could provide better security for the President. The change came at the last minute, after Sinatra had made extensive arrangements for the promised and eagerly awaited presidential visit, including the construction of a helipad. Sinatra was furious, believing that Lawford had failed to intercede with the Kennedys on his behalf, and ostracised him from the Rat Pack. \n\nSinatra and Lawford's friendship was over. They only spoke when Sinatra called after his son Frank Sinatra Jr. was kidnapped on 8 December 1963, and he needed the help of Lawford's brother-in-law Robert Kennedy, then Attorney General. With the exception of Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey's 1968 presidential race, Sinatra never endorsed another Democratic candidate. Crosby, a staunch Republican, ended up cast in Lawford's role.\n\nLawford married his second wife, Mary Rowan, daughter of comedian Dan Rowan, in October 1971. Rowan and Lawford separated two years later and divorced in January 1975. In June 1976 he married aspiring actress Deborah Gould, whom he had known for three weeks. Lawford and Gould separated two months after marrying and divorced in 1977. Following the divorce, Lawford moved into the Sierra Towers where he lived for the next few years on the thirtieth floor. During his separation from Gould, Lawford met Patricia Seaton who became his fourth and final wife in July 1984, just months before his death.\n\nLawford died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve 1984, aged 61, from cardiac arrest. He had suffered from kidney and liver failure after years of substance abuse. His body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery. Owing to a dispute between his widow and the cemetery, Lawford's ashes were removed from the cemetery in 1988 and scattered into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California by his widow Patricia Seaton Lawford, who invited the \"National Enquirer\" tabloid to photograph the event.\n\nFor his contribution to the television industry, Peter Lawford has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6920 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nA plaque bearing Lawford's name was erected at Westwood Village Memorial Park\n\n\n\n"}

Its sub-title is An Examination of the Tariff Question with Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor. As the title suggests, George examined the debate between protectionism and free trade.\n\nGeorge was opposed to tariffs, which were at the time both the major method of protectionist trade policy and an important source of federal revenue. He argued that tariffs kept prices high for consumers, while failing to produce any increase in overall wages. He also believed that tariffs protected monopolistic companies from competition, thus augmenting their power. Like Progress and Poverty, much of the book was devoted to attacking privileges, such as land monopoly, which limit trade and rob value from producers.\n\nLargely as a result of this book, free trade became a major issue in federal politics. \"Protection or Free Trade\" was the first book to be read entirely into the Congressional Record. It was read aloud by five Democratic congressmen.\n\nGeorge defended what he considered \"true free trade\". For him, this required free trade to be coupled with the treatment of land as common property:\n\nFree trade means free production. Now fully to free production it is necessary not only to remove all taxes on production, but also to remove all other restrictions on production. True free trade, in short, requires that the active factor of production, Labor, shall have free access to the passive factor of production, Land. To secure this all monopoly of land must be broken up, and the equal right of all to the use of the natural elements must be secured by the treatment of the land as the common property in usufruct of the whole people.\n\nIn 1997, Spencer MacCallum wrote that Henry George was \"undeniably the greatest writer and orator on free trade who ever lived.\"\n\nIn 2009, Tyler Cowen wrote that George's 1886 book \"Protection or Free Trade\" \"remains perhaps the best-argued tract on free trade to this day.\"\n\nJim Powell said that \"Protection or Free Trade\" was probably the best book on trade written by anyone in the Americas, comparing it Adam Smith's \"Wealth of Nations\".\n\nMilton Friedman said it was the most rhetorically brilliant work ever written on trade. Friedman also paraphrased one of George's arguments in favor of free trade: \"It’s a very interesting thing that in times of war, we blockade our enemies in order to prevent them from getting goods from us. In time of peace we do to ourselves by tariffs what we do to our enemy in time of war.”\n\nOswald Garrison Villard said, \"Few men made more stirring and valuable contributions to the economic life of modern America than did Henry George,\" and that what George had \"written about protection and free trade is as fresh and as valuable today as it was at the hour in which it was penned.\"\n\nThe table of contents are as follows:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "625914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625914", "title": "Theophostic counseling", "text": "Theophostic counseling\n\nTheophostic Counseling was developed in the United States during the mid-1990s Ed Smith, a Baptist minister. After concerns about legal liabilities associated with offering counseling services, Smith later changed the name to Theophostic Prayer Ministry.\n\nIts name comes from the Greek \"theo\" (God) and quasi-Greek \"phostic\" (light), and it is often associated with the Christian Inner Healing Movement. Smith says people are being delivered from phobias, depressions, anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorders, dissociative personality disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, sexual addictions, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, and homosexuality through Theophostic principles. The name Theophostic is a registered trademark.\n\nFew empirical evaluations of Theophostic Ministry are available, although Christian psychologist Fernando Garzon says that current case study and survey data has yielded clinically significant changes in client symptom levels, and high degrees of client and practitioner satisfaction.\n\nSmith's definition of Theophostic Prayer Ministry is that \"Theophostic is a ministry of helping emotionally wounded people to acknowledge and to identify the true source of their inner emotional pain and find lasting peace through receiving personalized truth directly from the Lord.\"\n\nSmith lists fourteen basic principles of Theophostic Prayer Ministry,:\n\n1. Our present situation is rarely the cause of our ongoing emotional pain.\n2. Everything we presently know, feel or are mentally aware of has its roots in a first-time experience.\n\n3. If we try to resolve our present conflicts without resolving our historical lie-based woundedness, we will find only temporary relief for our emotional pain. However, if we find renewal for our past, we can redeem our present.\n\n4. Since many of the negative emotions we currently feel are reflections of the past, they provide opportunities for the wounds of our lives to be exposed and thus for renewal to occur.\n\n5. To facilitate emotional renewal, we need to identify the three basic elements in the renewal process: (1) the present emotional pain, (2) the original memory container and (3) the original lie(s) implanted in the memory container.\n\n6. People are in emotional bondage due to two basic factors, belief and choice. These two factors are rooted in the context of deception.\n\n7. When we believe a lie, the outcome will often have much the same consequences as though it were true.\n\n8. To be free of the lies we believe, we must identify and own the lies rather than suppress or deny we believe them before we can be free from them.\n\n9. In the midst of our “darkness”, we must come to realize how utterly bound we are to the lie and how helpless we are to overcome its debilitating grip on our lives apart from God’s divine intervention.\n\n10. No person, including ourselves, is capable of talking us out of the lies we believe. We will be free only when we receive the truth from the One who is Truth (John 14:6, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life\").\n\n11. When we know the truth experientially, having received truth from God in our memory experience, we can walk in genuine maintenance-free victory in these areas of our lives.\n\n12. In time of crisis or in emotionally charged life situations, our experiential knowledge tends to override our logical truth.\n\n13. Lie-based pain can only be removed as the lies causing the pain are replaced with truth, whereas, sin-based pain can only be dealt with through the cross of Jesus.\n\n14. Mind renewal is a lifelong process.\n\nParticipants in a typical Theophostic Prayer Ministry session are the ministry recipient, a ministry facilitator and optionally a prayer partner.\n\nThe ministry facilitator ensures that the ministry recipient understands the process before the session begins.\n\nThe facilitator begins the session with a prayer of encouragement.\n\nThe ministry recipient closes his eyes and concentrates on feeling the emotional pain from which he is seeking relief. The purpose of focusing on the emotion is to allow his mind to drift back to a related memory\n. That memory is of a situation that the recipient regards as painful and which he has interpreted to form a belief about himself or his situation. The event that is contained in the memory may have occurred many years ago, for example in the person’s childhood. The emotion provides a bridge to the belief.\n\nThe ministry recipient describes the memory to the facilitator. The facilitator asks the recipient some questions that will enable the recipient to drill down to the core belief housed in this memory that is troubling him. The questions are not leading questions, as the facilitator does not assume anything about the memory’s content. Rather they are open questions, posed to help the recipient himself to identify the core belief. This core belief is known in TPM parlance as a “lie” that causes lie-based pain. The lie arises from the recipient’s interpretation of the situation. For example, a rape victim may have formed a belief that she is dirty or shameful, whereas she was actually an innocent victim. Though her belief is false, it has the same impact on her emotional state now as if it were true.\n\nOnce the recipient has identified the core troublesome belief, the facilitator prays, asking the Lord Jesus to provide the recipient with his perspective, that is, what he would like the recipient to know. The Lord answers that prayer in various ways. He might provide his truth to the recipient by means of a mental picture, a feeling, a scripture, a word, a realization or some other way. The truth received from Jesus replaces the painful lie previously believed. The result is peace.\n\nEvery person believes not just one, but many lies of the kind that lead to present emotional pain. Each lie can be eliminated with the same process.\n\nIn his 2008 book, Dr. Fernando Garzon, an associate professor in the Center for Counselling and Family Studies at Liberty University, describes his team’s two-year-long outcomes-based case study research project that evaluated TPM. The research team found very clear preliminary results that showed a correlation between TPM treatment and symptom reductions. Garzon wrote that the case studies strongly support the need for randomized comparative or control group studies.\n\nGarzon had conducted preliminary practitioner studies in 2001 which showed promise, concluding that \"...outcome-based case studies and randomized clinical trials should proceed on TPM to ascertain whether the therapeutic perception of efficacy displayed in this survey actually has merit...\" He also found that a wide variety of people were practicing Theophostic Ministry at that time, including pastors, lay counselors, and psychologists. According to Garzon, this raised questions about some practitioners' level of training.\n\nA Kentucky journalist has associated Theophostic Prayer Ministry with Recovered Memory Therapy, an approach now widely discredited after discovery of false memory phenomena\non the basis that Theophostic Prayer Ministry also presupposes the possibility of repression or memory inhibition, A critical entry from Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance also seeks to associate Theophostic Ministry with Recovered Memory Therapy, although the article does not identify the aspects of Theophostic Prayer Ministry that merit the assertion. It also claims that Theophostic Prayer Ministry has added beliefs about demonic possession, Satanic influence, direct communication with \"Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit\" and \"unique concepts about the inner workings of the mind\". However, Smith himself strongly repudiates Recovered Memory Therapy, and in recent years he has taught that it is counter-productive to pursue or even allow demonic confrontations in a ministry session. However, in his Basic Training Seminar Manual (and in each of the training videos), Smith warns strongly against making any suggestions that might affect the actual content of a memory, and he lists ten ways in which TPM differs from RMT. Nevertheless, once a core belief about self has been identified through the memory (not in the memory per se), Smith does \"invite the Lord\" to speak truth to the ministry recipient concerning that belief.\n\nIn an article about TPM in the Christian Research Journal, Elliot Miller said that to accuse TPM of practicing recovered memory therapy and visualization is to betray ignorance or bias against TPM that refuses to be corrected by clear and consistent facts.\n\nA Christian psychologist, David Entwistle, has expressed concerns with its practice: \"TPM follows in the lineage of 'healing of memory' techniques, though it departs from that lineage in a number of important respects. Numerous concerns exist surrounding insufficient attempts to ground TPM in biblical concepts; inadequate and often flawed explanations of basic psychological processes; dubious claims about the prevalence of DID, SRA, and demonic activity; estimates of traumatic abuse that exceed empirical findings; and the failure to sufficiently appreciate the possibility of iatrogenic memory contamination\".\n\nEntwistle raises concern over empirical validity, with questions about literal appearances of God, as Entwistle interprets claimed perceptions of truth, including spontaneous visualizations of Christ; ethical and legal issues relating to guarantees of healing; application of TPM to a variety of mental disorders without empirical validation; the legal question of whether it should be considered a religious intervention or a counseling procedure – and whether this was settled by changing the name from Theophostic Counseling to Theophostic Ministry; and the failure of Smith to welcome public analysis and critique of TPM.\n\nIn Cumberland County, Maine, sexual-abuse charges against pastor Thomas Wright were laid after a church member's memory surfaced during Theophostic sessions, of Wright allegedly abusing a child. When the case went to trial in 2002, the charges were thrown out by the District Attorney because evidence was based on ‘unconventional and biased therapeutic methods’. The District Attorney noted that these methods were considered unreliable by the American Psychological Society. In Australia, a psychologist was found guilty of malpractice for using Theophostic methods in 2006 by the Queensland Health Practitioners Tribunal. The tribunal found that Irene Moreau, who practiced from a Christian counselling centre in Brisbane, 'inappropriately used Theophostic Prayer Ministry as a counselling technique'.\n\nPractitioners of inner healing techniques such as TPM frequently do not have formal training in psychology or counseling, although Fernando Garzon suggests that this in many cases may be beneficial, saying: \"...it may serve people who might not get help otherwise, cannot afford professional therapy, do not wish to use insurance, or have access to counseling limited by managed care. Others belong to churches in which the pastor is either not trained, not interested, or not available (due to having too many other pastoral duties) to meet the needs for pastoral counseling. Still others simply may trust lay people, whom they know, more than a therapist, whom they do not know. In addition, the training itself may benefit the lay counselors spiritually and emotionally.\"\n\nIn addition to questions about the efficacy, safety and reliability of TPM, it has also divided Christian observers with regard to the soundness of its theology. In the conclusion of their paper \"A theological analysis of Theophostic Ministry\", Bryan Maier and Philip Monroe put it this way: \"...on the issues of sin and healing, the question remains for Christian counselors and the evangelical community as a whole as to whether Smith's \"theological basis\" is consistent with responsible biblical doctrine. We do not think that Smith has warrant to make this claim. Furthermore, we think these differences are so significant that we advise great caution before engaging in this ministry – whether as a client or as facilitator.\"\n\n"}

Total cost of good becomes cheaper when trading within the agreement because of the low tariff. This is as compared to trading with countries outside the agreement with lower cost goods but higher tariff. The related term Trade creation is when the formation of a trade agreement between countries decreases of price of the goods for more consumers, and therefore increases overall trade. In this case the more efficient producer with the agreement increases trade.\n\nThe terms were used by 'old' Chicago School economist Jacob Viner in his 1950 paper \"The Customs Union Issue\".\n\nAn early use of the terms was by Jacob Viner in his 1950 paper \"The Customs Union Issue\". Later in same decade Richard Lipsey noted that not only the location of production but also the location of consumption of goods would be effected by trade agreements.\n\nBéla Balassa discussed the concepts in relation to the European Common Market in his paper 1967 \"Trade Creation and Trade Diversion in the European Common Market\".\n\nIn 2013, Paul Oslington's \"Contextual History, Practitioner History, and Classic Status: Reading Jacob Viner’s The Customs Union Issue reviewed\" revisited Viner's original paper.\n\nWhen a country applies the same tariff to all nations, it will always import from the most efficient producer, since the more efficient nation will provide the goods at a lower price. With the establishment of a bilateral or regional free trade agreement, that may not be the case.\nIf the agreement is signed with a less-efficient nation, it may well be that their products become cheaper in the importing market than those from the more-efficient nation, since there are taxes for only one of them. Consequently, after the establishment of the agreement, the importing country would acquire products from a higher-cost producer, instead of the low-cost producer from which it was importing until then. In other words, this would cause a trade diversion.\n\nThe term was coined by Jacob Viner in \"The Customs Union Issue\" in 1950. In its literal meaning the term was however incomplete, as it failed to capture all welfare effects of discriminatory tariff liberalization, and it was not useful when it came to non-tariff barriers. Economists have however dealt with this incompleteness in two ways. Either they stretched the original meaning to cover all welfare effects, or they introduced new terms like trade expansion or internal versus external trade creation.\n\nViner's article became and still is the foundation of the theory of international economic integration. It considered only two states comparing their trade flows with the rest of the world after they abolish customs tariffs on inner border of their union. Following the fact that economic unions most often include more than 2 states, attempts have been made to increase the number of the states (3+world), but not so successfully, as they did not have as clear conclusions as Viner's.\n\nOpposite to economically efficient trade creation effect, the trade diversion flow is cost-inefficient compared with the rest of the world. Balance between trade creation and trade diversion effects due to the creation of economic union makes the union either economically efficient (positive balance) or inefficient (negative balance). It is based on the fact that unification of states usually applies mergers of more than 1 sector in economy (even European Coal and Steel Union, which had 2 sectors only) leading to the creation of either trade creation or diversion effects.\n\nPositive effects of trade diversion include increase of trade between unified states, increase of employment in manufacturing states inside the union consequently leading to increase of respective taxes and welfare.\n\nDiverted trade may hurt the non-member nation economically and politically, and create a strained relationship between the two nations. The decreased output of the good or service traded from one nation with a high comparative advantage to a nation of lower comparative advantage works against creating more efficiency and therefore against more overall surplus. It is widely believed by economists that trade diversion is harmful to consumers.\nThe dynamics of trade diversion was described by Ravshanbek Dalimov in 2009. He used similarity of trade flows to the flux of gas or liquid stimulated by the pressure difference, while the flows of trade flows are stimulated by the price difference. This allowed use of Navier-Stokes equations for the interregional dynamics of trade flows.\n\n"}
