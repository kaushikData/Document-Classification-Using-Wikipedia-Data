The building was constructed in 1988 by the Mitsui Fudosan development group and designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, 461 Fifth Avenue was the residence of the Misses Furniss, who were known for hosting musicals and other social functions. They had acquired the address from a J. M. Bixby sometime after 1873.\n\nSometime between 1911 and 1915, the private house was replaced with an eleven-story office building, which in 1945 was renovated to become a Lane Bryant store. By 1988 the Lane Bryant building was demolished.\n\nThe current structure was built in 1988 by a Japanese-lead development group using a design by Raul de Armas of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Within a year of completion, the building had a 90% occupancy rate and had spurred a building boom in the Fifth Avenue area. By 1992 it was fully leased. The first floor shopping level was occupied by a Pier 1 Imports until 2007, when it was leased to BCBGMAXAZRIA.\n\nThe building was sold to its current owner, SL Green Realty, in 2003 for $62.3 million.\n\nThe 461 Fifth Avenue building is noted for its use of modern materials, creating a stone-finish look, as well as its base-setback that is the same height as older buildings in the neighborhood. The building is also noted architecturally for its combination of a 10-story 19th-century base, which mirrors nearby older buildings, and an 18-story post-modern tower.\n\nThe exterior uses a pre-cast concrete finish to mimic the appearance of limestone and has a copper mansard roof similar to other buildings in the area.\n"}

Located at the intersection of 57th Street and Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) in Manhattan, it is temporarily closed for renovations until December 2018. Under normal service patterns, it is served by the F train at all times. North of the station, the line turns east and becomes the IND 63rd Street Line.\n\nFirst announced in 1962, the 57th Street station was opened on July 1, 1968, at the cost of $13.2 million. The station was a terminal station until 1989, after which all service was extended to 21st Street–Queensbridge. The station was temporarily served by shuttle trains in the 1990s during the 63rd Street Line's reconstruction. In July 2018, the station was closed for an extensive five-month renovation.\n\nThe station was built as part of the Chrystie Street Connection, which expanded train capacity on the Sixth Avenue Line. The Sixth Avenue extension to the new terminal at 57th Street was announced in 1962. The next year, the contract to construct the IND Sixth Avenue Line between 52nd and 58th Streets, including the 57th Street station, was awarded to Slattery Construction Company for $7.5 million (). Construction of the spur ultimately cost $13.2 million.\n\nThe 57th Street station opened on July 1, 1968, as one of two stations added during construction of the Chrystie Street Connection, the other being Grand Street. The opening of the station was celebrated by a 300-guest lunch on the platform on June 27, which was attended by Deputy Mayor Robert W. Sweet; MTA Chairman William J. Ronan; and Avenue of the Americas Association president Eyssell. The new station was intended to serve the new residential and commercial developments being built in the immediate area. Upon its opening, the 57th Street station acted as the terminus of two services, the B during rush hours and KK during off-peak hours. The KK was renamed the K in 1974 and eliminated in 1976. From 1978 to 1990, this station was also served by the JFK Express service to the eponymous airport.\n\nWhen the north side of the Manhattan Bridge was closed for construction from 1986-1998 and again from July to December 2001, this station was only served by a shuttle train along Sixth Avenue. Starting in 1988, this station was served by Q trains on weekdays, B trains on weekday evenings and weekends, and F trains during late nights. This was the terminal for all services until the IND 63rd Street Line to 21st Street–Queensbridge opened on October 29, 1989 Late night F-train service was replaced by a shuttle in 1997. Since December 2001, when the 63rd Street Tunnel Connector opened in Queens, the F route has served this station at all times, simultaneous with the withdrawal of all other services from the 63rd Street Line.\n\nUnder the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan, this station, along with 32 others, will undergo a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps, improved signage, and improved station lighting. In January 2018, the NYCT and Bus Committee recommended that Judlau Contracting receive the $125 million contract for the renovations of 57th and 23rd Streets on the IND Sixth Avenue Line; 28th Street on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and 34th Street–Penn Station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and IND Eighth Avenue Line. However, the MTA Board temporarily deferred the vote for these packages after city representatives refused to vote to award the contracts. The contract was put back for a vote in February, where it was ultimately approved. The station was closed for renovations on July 9, 2018 until December 2018. \n\n57th Street contains two tracks and a single island platform serving both tracks. From the full-length mezzanine, there are six staircases to the platform. The station walls are plain white, with \"57th St\" stenciled on long, narrow tiles along the wall. The platform is approximately below ground.\n\nMuch of the station design remains unchanged from 1968 opening. , the \"Next Train\" indicator lights were still hanging from the platform ceiling, dating from the period when the station was a terminal two decades prior. The tower and the crew area still exist. They were used until the 63rd Street extension opened to 21st Street–Queensbridge in 1989, but were back in service in 1998 when trains from Sixth Avenue terminated here due to long term construction work that necessitated a shuttle train from Queensbridge to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue on the BMT Broadway Line. Once all construction work was completed on the 63rd Street Connector to the IND Queens Boulevard Line in December 2001, the tower was permanently abandoned.\n\nA plaque dedicated to retired Colonel John T. O'Neill, who served as the New York City Transit Authority's Chief Engineer until his death in 1978, sits next to the booth on the west wall.\n\nThere are eight street staircases spread on both sides of Sixth Avenue from 56th to 57th Streets. These entrances have an unusual design, with lit posts reading \"SUBWAY\" on their side rather than the lighted red-or-green globes typical to other station entrances.\n\n"}

In 2007 the first Alternative Elfstedentocht in Mongolia will be held.\n\nThe Austrian editions became the most popular through the years as thousands of Dutch people travel to the Weissensee each year to compete each other in several speed skating marathons in various distances, with the 200 km Open Dutch National Championships being the main and most prestigious event. Until 2006 this gave the local authorities a profit of 36 million euros. As a result, Koopmans and co-organiser Leo van Hees (who died in 2002) were awarded with the Austrian Cross of Honour.\n\nSince 2006 he resided in Portugal. He was scheduled to retire from his position as Alternative Elfstedentocht organiser in 2011, but was taken to a Coimbra hospital in November 2006. He suffered from bacterial infections and pneumonia, which resulted in his death on 15 January 2007.\n\nThe already scheduled Alternative Elfstedentocht of 2007 and the other scheduled races in the same period will go through, but in memorial of Aart Koopmans.\n\n"}

He became a small business owner and was involved in local politics at the school board level. He married Shelley McDougall in 1972. In the 1991 provincial election, Graham was defeated by Liberal incumbent Fred Harvey, however Harvey's victory was later declared void when Harvey was convicted of violating election spending laws. Graham was successful in a by-election in 1993 winning the Carleton North seat. Graham went on to be re-elected in the new electoral district of Carleton in the 1995, 1999, 2003, 2006 and 2010 elections.\n\nGraham's 1993 victory was a key test for his Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick. His party had been defeated provincially in 1987 going from having led the government for 17 years to being shut out of the legislature. Though the party regained 3 seats in the 58 seat legislature in 1991, the upstart Confederation of Regions Party of New Brunswick (CoR) had won 8 seats and claimed official opposition. Graham's victory was seen as a sign that CoR would not necessarily displace the Progressive Conservatives as the voice of conservatism in Anglophone New Brunswick.\n\nIn 1999, Graham's party was returned to government. Graham, who co-chaired the election campaign, was named deputy premier and Minister of Supply and Services.

Earnings is also the amount on which corporate tax is due. For an analysis of specific aspects of corporate operations several more specific terms are used as EBIT -- earnings before interest and taxes, EBITDA - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nMany alternative terms for earnings are in common use, such as income and profit. These terms in turn have a variety of definitions, depending on their context and the objectives of the authors. For instance, the IRS uses the term profit to describe earnings, whereas for the corporation the profit it reports is the amount left after taxes are taken out. Many economic discussions use principles derived from Karl Marx and Adam Smith.

They may be employed in product evaluation and testing, using measuring and diagnostic devices to adjust, test, and repair equipment. Electronics technicians may also work as sales workers or field representatives for manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers giving advice on the installation, operation, and maintenance of complex equipment and may write specifications and technical manuals. Electronics technicians represent over 33% of all engineering technicians in the U.S. In 2009, there were over 160,000 electronics technicians employed in the U.S. Electronics technicians are accredited by organizations such as the Electronics Technicians Association (ETA), or International Society of Certified Electronics Technicians (ISCET).\n\nMost employers prefer to hire electronics technicians with an associate degree or other post-secondary training in engineering technology. Training is available at technical institutes, at community colleges, at extension divisions of colleges and universities, at public and private vocational-technical schools, and in the Armed Forces. Naval electronics technicians are the largest group of engineering technicians in the military (see Electronics Technician (US Navy)). Many 2-year associate degree programs accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) include at least college algebra and trigonometry and one or two basic science courses. Depending on the specialty, more math or science may be required. About 200 ABET-accredited programs are offered in engineering technology specialities. ABET-accredited electronics technician programs usually require at least two mathematics courses and two physics courses in addition to the core competencies.\n\nElectronics technician curriculum generally consists of courses in basic electricity and electronics, including Ohm's Law, Parallel and Series Circuits, Magnetism, AC/DC Circuits, Capacitance, Inductance, Transformers, Resonance, Filters, Semiconductors, Transistors, Amplifiers, Integrated Circuits and Digital electronics. In addition to vocational learning outcomes associated with the study of electronics and control systems, graduates of electronics technician programs are also expected to have essential employability skills and meet certain general education learning outcomes. Individual schools largely determine the specific program structure, delivery methods, and other curriculum components to be used to assist students in achieving the required program outcomes.\n\nA significant component of course material includes laboratory experimentation. These lab courses and projects often represent up to 50% of the course material and are used to reinforce theoretical concepts associated with the study of electronics. Schools offering electronics technician programs will have electronics laboratories to support the delivery of course curriculum. Historically, these laboratories have been traditional \"hands on\" learning environments, although in recent years the trend is moving towards electronics simulation software such as Multisim and CircuitLogix. Electronics software simulation is also used in conjunction with traditional labs to provide greater opportunities for students to complete laboratory projects as part of their studies.\n\nThe demand for jobs in the electronics engineering and service fields is the result of a recent proliferation of both consumer and industrial electronics products. The design, installation, servicing and maintenance of this equipment has created significant employment opportunities in the electronics industry.\nTypical job-related activities may involve:\n\nJob opportunities for electrical and electronics technologists and technicians are increasing because many industries use electronic products and systems. Key sectors are telecommunications, audio/video, computers, robotics, energy conversion and efficiency, power generation, transmission and distribution, and electrical equipment manufacturing.\nEmployment opportunities for electronics technicians vary and are largely based on their areas of expertise. For example, employment growth for Electronics technicians in areas such as robotics, energy conversion, and power generation is expected to grow by 5%/yr from 2010 through 2020.\n"}
{"id": "41556404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41556404", "title": "Firestone Natural Rubber Company", "text": "Firestone Natural Rubber Company\n\nFirestone Natural Rubber Company, LLC is a subsidiary of the Bridgestone Americas, Inc. Headquartered in Nashville, TN, the company operates the largest contiguous rubber plantation in the world in Liberia, which first opened in 1926.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the United States access to rubber was restricted by the European colonial powers (Britain and the Netherlands), which held a monopoly in rubber production. Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce, considered rubber a vital resource due to its usage for car tires and began working with American rubber companies in order to find a rubber source that was controlled by US interests. Part of a Department of Commerce-subsidised worldwide search for a place for rubber plantations, rubber magnate Harvey Samuel Firestone sent experts to Liberia in December 1923 to do a soil survey.\n\nIn 1926, the Liberian government granted Firestone a 99-year lease for a million acres (to be chosen by the company wherever in Liberia) at a price of 6 cents per acre, Firestone then set about establishing rubber tree plantations of the non-native South American rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis in the country, eventually creating the world's largest rubber plantation. Firestone also provided a $5 million loan at a 7% interest rate to the government to pay the foreign debts it had and to build a harbour needed by Firestone. The loan was given in exchange for complete authority over the government's revenues until the loan was paid.\n\nThe loan took a larger and larger portion of the Liberian government's incomes: it grew from 20% of the total revenue of Liberia in 1929, to 32% in 1930, to 54.9% in 1931 and nearly the whole revenue in 1932. An estimation made by a member of the American Legation in Liberia said that Liberia really paid a 17% interest rate for the loan.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, as rubber price fell, Firestone stopped its development of the plantation (using just 50,000 acres and cutting wages in half), and, depriving the Liberian government of tax incomes, the government missed a payment to the loans to the company. Firestone asked the US government to send a warship to Monrovia to enforce the debt payment, but President Franklin Delano Roosevelt rejected the \"gunboat diplomacy\". The loans to the company were finally paid in 1952.\n\nAs rubber demand went down during the 1980s, Firestone dismissed a number of 5000 workers, leading to the local antipathy to the company. On June 6, 1990, during the First Liberian Civil War, the resistance group National Patriotic Front of Liberia took over the Firestone plantation and evacuated US personnel. The exact nature of Firestone's activities in the plantation between 1990 and 1997 is unclear, the government's official stance was that they were able to take it back within a few months, while media reports say that it was not operational until late 1994.\n\nIn 1997, after the violence was over, the company restarted the operations, at first at a third of capacity, with 3000 workers. The company soon faced a number of violent protests, as its employees wanted better working conditions, better pay and resettlement benefits. By October 2008, it was operating at half the capacity, withholding further investments until the government finally agreed to give the company a lenient tax status.\n\nIn 2005, the Firestone Company and the Liberian government signed a new 37-year deal raising the lease to 50 cents per acre.\n\nThe workers accuse the company of serious labor abuses, including exploitative child labor, which they claim amount to modern-day slavery. Workers specifically claim that Firestone's high daily quotas force them to employ their own children, subjecting them to grueling and dangerous work conditions. In response to the claims, the president of Firestone Natural Rubber told a CNN interviewer that \"each tapper will tap about 650 trees a day, where they spend perhaps a couple of minutes at each tree.\" As the network pointed out, this would add up to more than 21 hours of work per day.\n\nIn May 2006, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) released a report detailing the state of human rights on Liberia's rubber plantations. According to the report, Firestone managers in Liberia admitted that the company does not effectively monitor its own policy prohibiting child labor. UNMIL found that several factors contribute to the occurrence of child labor on Firestone plantations: pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education.\n\nIn November 2005, the International Labor Rights Fund, representing \"tappers\" (workers who extract latex from rubber trees) on the Liberian plantation, filed an Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) case in US District Court in California against Bridgestone (parent company owning Firestone), alleging \"forced labor, the modern equivalent of slavery\", on the Firestone Plantation in Harbel, Liberia.\n\nThe lawsuit stated: \n\nFirestone rejected these allegations, stating that the corporation has provided employment and pensions to thousands of Liberians as well as healthcare. The company also provides education and training opportunities to employees and their children.\n\nIn reply to the charge of exploitative child labor, Management of the plantation claims that workers are bringing their own children to work to assist them and that this is not endorsed by the plantation management.\n\nWorkers claim that management's high daily quotas force them to employ their own children as their only means of meeting quotas.\n\nEven though Liberia does have child labor laws and Firestone has banned children from tapping trees, workers say the ban is not enforced. The workers say the only way they can complete their daily quota is to bring their children along.\n\nFirestone management says if children are found helping their parents, the employees are cancelled, and if necessary, disciplined. \"We have very strict policies about our child labor.

It is in St. Johns River Park (also known as Friendship Fountain Park) at the west end of Downtown Jacksonville's Southbank Riverwalk attraction. The world's largest and tallest fountain when it opened, it has been one of Jacksonville's most recognizable and popular attractions. \n\nThe fountain and park were designed by Jacksonville architect Taylor Hardwick in 1963 and opened in 1965. The fountain's three pumps could push of water per minute up to in height. Friendship Fountain remained one of Jacksonville's signature attractions through the 20th century, but severe corrosion and deterioration to the equipment resulted in periodic closures in the 2000s. In 2011 the city completed a $3.2 million renovation to the fountain and the surrounding park.\n\nThe fountain and Friendship Park was designed by Taylor Hardwick, the Jacksonville architect who also designed the Haydon Burns Library. An area of of land were donated for the project by the Southside Business Men's Club, an organization dedicated to the improvement of the Southside that was established in 1932. Begun in 1963 and completed at a cost of $1.7 million, the park opened in March 1965. The \"world’s largest and tallest\" fountain at the time, it became a popular tourist attraction. \n\nThe three pumps had a combined and could push per minute; some streams as tall as a 10-story building. The enclosure for the pumps and controls was so large that the architect had to include it as an element of design.\n\nThe Fountain was originally called the \"Fountain of Friendship in Dallas Thomas Park\"; \"friendship\" at the suggestion of a Rotary Club member and \"Dallas Thomas\" after the city's parks and finance commissioner. However, when Thomas was later involved in a scandal and indicted, the park was renamed in 1968.\n\nThe Acosta Bridge was rebuilt beginning in 1990, and the Diamond Head Lobster House was in its path and had to be demolished. The city agreed to use a big portion of Friendship park for the new restaurant and parking lot, cutting the park by more than half. \nEssentially, all the design structures in the park were removed-—with the exception of the fountain itself—-for what became a boondoggle.\nThe new facility was named Harbormasters, and the city guaranteed a $2.9 million federal building loan on the city's land. Initial success was followed by lawsuits, a new owner, missed rent payments, foreclosure, loan default and finally closure in 1992. \nWhen the venture failed, the city had to pay off the nearly $3 million loan. The River City Brewing Company, which replaced Harbormasters in November 1993, has been successful, but because the city owns the land, the restaurant pays no property taxes.\n\nFriendship Fountain functioned for over 20 years and was refurbished in December 1985, before resuming operation for another 15 years. Finally, wear and corrosion forced its closure at the end of the century. A five-month, $1.3 million rehabilitation began when the fountain was drained in March 2001. A new feature was added: six light towers with computer-controlled color-changing floodlights. Unanticipated damage to stainless steel pipes was uncovered, requiring a $97,000 increase in cost and two-month delay, but the fountain re-opened in December 2001. It operated for seven months until a power outage/voltage spike damaged the computer controller and blew out 40 lights and lenses on April 29, 2002. That was repaired, and the fountain was fully functional for nearly 3 years. It was a major attraction at Super Bowl XXXIX in February 2005, but two months later, two of the three original (40-year-old) pumps failed and parts were no longer available. The replacement cost for the pumps was estimated at $400,000, but the city budget was tight and money was not available. Afterward the fountain was run on one pump with a greatly reduced flow. It was repaired in 2011 and is functional.\n\n\nThe future of the Jacksonville landmark was in doubt for a number of years. A number of proposals were made, including moving Kids Kampus from Metropolitan Park and eliminating the fountain, rebuilding a smaller fountain or renovating the existing fountain. As of May 2008, there was $15 million in the city's capital projects budget to improve the Southbank Riverwalk, which includes the area around Friendship Fountain; but Mayor John Peyton felt the amount was not enough.\n\nThe Jacksonville City Council approved final plans for a $3.2 million renovation and repair to the surrounding park and Friendship Fountain on February 9, 2010. On August 10, 2010 , The Friends of Friendship Fountain Website, reported communications from the Jacksonville Economic Development Commission that AC General Inc was named contractor for the project. An official groundbreaking was held on September 1, 2010 marking the start of the renovation of Friendship Fountain and Park. The fountain was closed for eight months for construction, and reopened again on June 18, 2011 amid a celebration.\n\n"}

He was president of the Ford Motor Company from 1945 to 1960, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman for several months thereafter. Notably, under the leadership of Henry Ford II, Ford Motor Company became a publicly traded corporation in 1956. From 1943 to 1950, he also served as president of the Ford Foundation.\n\nHenry Ford II was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Eleanor Clay Ford and Edsel Ford on September 4, 1917. He, brothers Benson and William, and sister Josephine, grew up amid affluence. He graduated from The Hotchkiss School in 1936. He attended Yale University, where he served on the business staff of \"The Yale Record\", the campus humor magazine, but left in 1940 before graduation.\n\nWhen his father Edsel, president of Ford, died of cancer in May 1943 (during World War II), Henry Ford II was serving in the Navy and unable to take over the presidency of the family-owned business. The elderly and ailing Henry Ford, company founder, re-assumed the presidency. By this point in his life, the elder Ford was mentally inconsistent, suspicious, and no longer fit for the job; most of the directors did not want to see him as president. But for the previous 20 years, although he had long been without any official executive title, he had always had de facto control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different. The directors elected him, and he served until the end of the war. During this period the company began to decline, losing over $10 million a month. The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt considered a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production, but the idea never progressed to execution.\n\nHenry Ford II left the Navy in July 1943 and joined the company's management a few weeks later. After two years, he assumed presidency of the business on September 21, 1945. Since it had been assumed that Edsel Ford would continue in his capacity as president of the company for much longer than turned out to be the case, Henry Ford II had received little grooming for the position, and he took over the company during a chaotic period; its European factories had suffered a great deal of damage during the war, and domestic sales were also in decline.\n\nHenry Ford II immediately adopted an aggressive management style. One of his first acts as company president was to place John Bugas in charge of taking control of the company from its entrenched management and firing Harry Bennett, head of the Ford Service Department, whom his grandfather initially hired to stifle attempts at unionization. Next, acknowledging his inexperience, he hired several seasoned executives to support him. He hired former General Motors executives Ernest Breech and Lewis Crusoe away from the Bendix Corporation. Breech was to serve in the coming years as HF2's business mentor, and the Breech–Crusoe team would form the core of Ford's business expertise, offering much-needed experience.\n\nAdditionally, Henry Ford II hired ten young up-and-comers, known as the \"Whiz Kids\". These ten, gleaned from an Army Air Forces statistical team, Henry Ford II envisioned as giving the company the ability to innovate and stay current. Two of them, Arjay Miller and Robert McNamara, went on to serve as presidents of Ford themselves. A third member, J. Edward Lundy, served in key financial roles for several decades and helped to establish Ford Finance's reputation as one of the best Finance organizations in the world. As a team, the \"whiz kids\" are probably best remembered as the design team for the 1949 Ford, which they took from concept to production in nineteen months, and which re-established Ford as a formidable automotive company. It was reported that 100,000 orders for this car were taken the day it was introduced to the market.\n\nHenry Ford II was president of Ford Motor Company from 1945 to 1960. In 1956, under his leadership, the company became a publicly traded corporation and dedicated its new world headquarters building. When he resigned the presidency, he became CEO of the company. During his term as CEO of Ford, he resided in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. On July 13, 1960, he was additionally elected Chairman; he resigned as CEO on October 1, 1979, and as Chairman in 1980. His nephew, William Clay Ford, Jr. would later assume these positions after 20 years of non-Ford family management of the company. During the interim, the family interests were represented on the board by Henry's younger brother William Clay Ford, Sr., as well as Henry's son Edsel Ford II and his nephew William Clay Ford, Jr.\n\nDuring the early 1960s Henry Ford II engaged in lengthy negotiations with Enzo Ferrari to buy Ferrari, with a view to expanding Ford's presence in motorsport in general and at the Le Mans 24 Hours in particular. However negotiations collapsed due to disputes over control over Ferrari's racing division. The collapse of the deal led him to inaugurate the Ford GT40 project, intended to end Ferrari's dominance at Le Mans (the Italian marque won the race six consecutive times from 1960 to 1965). After two difficult years in 1964 and 1965, in 1966 GT40s locked out the podium at both the Daytona 24 Hours and the Sebring 12 Hours before taking the first of four consecutive wins at Le Mans.\n\nIn 1973 and 1974, as it became clear that the American car market would begin to favor smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, Ford's then-President Lee Iacocca was highly interested in buying powertrains from Honda Motor Company as a way to minimize the cost of developing a small Ford car for the North American market, such as a modified version of Ford of Europe's Ford Fiesta. The plan was rejected by Henry Ford II, who stated: \"No car with my name on the hood is going to have a Jap engine inside.\" Although, strictly speaking, it was too late for that, as the Ford Motor Company had been selling a Mazda compact pickup truck as the Ford Courier since late 1971, Henry Ford II did not like the idea of flagship North American passenger car models moving in that direction. Ford Motor Company did go on to adapt to the era in which Japanese, German, and American participation in a globalized automobile industry became tightly integrated. For example, Ford's relationship with Mazda was well developed even before the end of HF2's period of influence. However, in Iacocca's view, it lagged several years behind GM and Chrysler, due to Henry Ford II's unappealable influence, before others led it forward despite his resistance.\n\nHF2's management style caused the company's fortunes to fluctuate in more ways than one. For example, he allowed the offering of public stock in 1956, which raised $650 million for the company, but the \"experimental car\" program instituted during his tenure, the Edsel, cost the company almost half that. Likewise, HF2 hired the creative Lee Iacocca, who was fundamental to the success of the Ford Mustang, in 1964, but fired Iacocca due to personal disputes in 1978 (about the break in their relationship, Iacocca quoted Ford as saying, \"Sometimes you just don't like somebody\"). He formally retired from all positions at Ford Motor Company on October 1, 1982, upon reaching the company's mandatory retirement age of 65, but remained the ultimate source of authority at Ford until his death in 1987.\n\n\nHenry Ford II was married three times:\n\n\nFord died of pneumonia in Detroit at Henry Ford Hospital on September 29, 1987, at age 70. After a private funeral service at Christ Church Grosse Pointe, his remains were cremated and the ashes scattered.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

He was also a successful real estate investor. After selling his stock in Carnegie Steel, he devoted a great deal of his time and money to philanthropic works.\n\nHenry Phipps Jr. was born on September 27, 1839 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the son of English born Hannah Frank and Henry Phipps, an English shoemaker who migrated to Philadelphia in the early part of the 19th century before settling in Pittsburgh in 1845. He was educated at public schools in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. He had one sister, Amelia Phipps Walker (Mrs. John Walker; 1846-1887), and two brothers: William Henry Phipps (1825-1902), and John Phipps (1833-1860), who was also friends with Carnegie and who died young.\n\nPhipps began working as a young man as an office boy and later a bookkeeper with Dillworth & Bidwell. In 1861, he became a partner in Bidwell & Phipps, which was an agent for the du Pont Powder Company, and a partner in Kloman & Phipps, a small iron mill.\n\nIn 1865, he became a partner in childhood friend and neighbor's Andrew (1835–1919) and Thomas Carnegie's (1843–1886) Union Iron Mills, which was created from a merger between Phipps' Kloman & Phipps and Cyclops Iron Company, an iron company which the Carnegies had acquired an interest in. Kloman and Phipps at first refused, but Thomas made an offer of all the shares in Cyclops plus an additional payment of $50,000 (). Therefore, on May 1, 1865, the new Union Iron Mills Company was formed.\n\nFor the next year, Phipps and Carnegie went to Europe on tour, and when they returned in 1866, went to work. Phipps toiled for the next 20 years and proved a capable financier, becoming Carnegie's business partner in Carnegie Steel Company, founded in 1892, which would make him a very wealthy man as the company's second largest shareholder. In 1901, Carnegie Steel Company was sold to the United States Steel Corporation; a newly formed organisation, set up by Pierpont Morgan. It sold for $400 million (approx. $13.3 billion today), of which $226 million went to Carnegie himself, and $48 million went to Phipps.\n\nIn 1907, Henry Phipps established Bessemer Trust Company to manage his substantial assets that would be shared by his offspring following his death.\n\nIn 1909, Phipps expanded his Cape Cod holdings to the entire 800 acre Great Island on Cape Cod, purchasing the remaining 50 acres from Charles B. Cory (1857–1921). The Cape Cod estate was next to Aberdeen Hall (which burnt down in September 1924) and was near Andrew Carnegie, Henry M. Flagler, and Henry Clay Frick's estates.\n\nIn 1912, Phipps divided $3,000,000 () worth of real estate in Chicago, Illinois realty among his three sons. Later in the same year, he also gave his sons $10,000,000 () worth of property in Pittsbugh.\n\nIn 1916, he purchased property in Great Neck, Long Island in the Village of Lake Success and in 1917, began construction on a thirty-nine-room Georgian mansion summer home, which was completed in 1919. He named the home, Bonnie Blink, which is Scottish for Pretty View. After his death, the mansion and property were donated to the school district and have since become William A. Shine Great Neck South High School.\n\nIn 1926, he bought Island Beach, which was sold by his heirs in 1953 to the State of New Jersey. Now known as Island Beach State Park, it is the last remaining stretch of undeveloped barrier island on the central New Jersey coast.\n\nPhipps was one of the pioneer investors in Florida real estate. At one time, he and his family owned one-third of the town of Palm Beach, 28 miles (approximately 45 kilometers) of oceanfront between Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, prime bay front property in downtown Miami, and 29,653 acres (approximately 12,000 hectares) of land in Martin County. The Phipps family donated to the town of Palm Beach one of the most significant gifts in county history: an ocean-to-lake frontage property that is now known as Phipps Park.\n\nPhipps believed that those who have achieved great wealth should give back for the public good and create institutions dedicated to that purpose. As such he was involved with a number of philanthropic causes, the best known of which is the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in Schenley Park, an 1893 gift to the city of Pittsburgh. Among his many benevolent works, he also funded the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis at the University of Pennsylvania and The Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital which in 1913 made possible the first inpatient facility in the United States for the mentally ill constructed as part of an acute care hospital.\n\nPhipps was also an advocate of decent housing for the poor and in 1905 Phipps funded the non-profit Phipps Houses to build affordable housing in New York City. He gave $1,000,000 () to build tenement houses for \"working people.\" Phipps Houses still operates to this day; Henry Phipps's great-grandson, Stuart S.

In recent years, she has written for that publication regarding: money in politics; government prosecution of whistleblowers; the United States Predator drone program; Donald Trump's ghostwriter,; and President Trump's financial backer, Robert Mercer. In 2016, Mayer's book \"Dark Money\"—in which she investigated the history of the right-wing billionaire network centered on the Koch brothers—was published to critical acclaim.\n\nMayer was born in New York City. Her mother, Meredith (née Nevins), is a painter, a former president of the Manhattan Graphics Center, and a print-maker. Her father, William Mayer, was a composer. Her paternal great-great-grandfather was Emanuel Lehman, one of the founders of Lehman Brothers. Her maternal grandparents were Mary Fleming (Richardson) and Allan Nevins, a historian and John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s authorized biographer, who wrote that, despite the Ludlow Massacre, Rockefeller and his fellow industrialists \"...did nothing criminal.\"\n\nMayer attended two prestigious, non-denominational secondary schools: Fieldston, in the northwest area of the Bronx borough of New York City; and—as an exchange student in 1972-1973—Bedales, a boarding school in the village of Steep, Hampshire, England. A 1977 \"magna cum laude\" graduate of Yale University, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and served as senior editor of the \"Yale Daily News Magazine\" and as campus stringer for \"Time\" magazine. She continued her studies at Oxford University.\n\nMayer began her journalistic career in Vermont writing for two small weekly papers, \"The Weathersfield Weekly\" and \"The Black River Tribune\", before moving to the daily \"Rutland Herald\". She worked as a metropolitan reporter for the now-defunct \"Washington Star\", and in 1982 joined \"The Wall Street Journal\", where she worked for 12 years. She was the first woman at the WSJ to be named White House correspondent, and subsequently, senior writer and front page editor.\n\nShe served as a war correspondent and foreign correspondent for the \"Journal\", where she reported on the bombing of the American barracks in Beirut, the Persian Gulf War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the last days of Communism in the former Soviet Union. Mayer also contributes to the \"New York Review of Books\", \"The Washington Post\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and the \"American Prospect.\"\n\nShe has co-authored two books: \"Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas\" (1994) (co-authored with Jill Abramson), a study of the nomination and appointment of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court; and \"Landslide: The Unmaking of the President, 1984–1988\" (1989; co-authored with Doyle McManus), an account of Ronald Reagan's second term in the White House. \"Strange Justice\" was adapted as a 1999 Showtime television movie of the same name, starring Delroy Lindo, Mandy Patinkin, and Regina Taylor. \"Strange Justice\" was a finalist for the 1994 National Book Award for Nonfiction, and both books were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\n\"Time\" magazine said of \"Strange Justice\": \"Its portrait of Thomas as an id suffering in the role of a Republican superego is more detailed and convincing than anything that has appeared so far.\" Of \"Landslide\", \"The New York Times\" Washington correspondent Steven V. Roberts said, \"This is clearly a reporter's book, full of rich anecdote and telling detail... I am impressed with the amount of inside information collected here.\"\n\nMayer's third nonfiction book, \"The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals\" (2008), addresses the origins, legal justifications, and possible war crimes liability of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques (commonly considered torture) on detainees and the subsequent deaths of detainees, sometimes victims of mistaken identity, under such interrogation by the CIA and DOD. The roles of Dick Cheney and attorneys David Addington and John Yoo in providing cover for the grisly procedures were prominent. The book was a finalist for the National Book Awards.\n\nIn its review of \"The Dark Side\", \"The New York Times\" noted that the book is \"the most vivid and comprehensive account we have so far of how a government founded on checks and balances and respect for individual rights could have been turned against those ideals.\" The \"Times\" subsequently named \"The Dark Side\" one of its ten most notable books of the year.\n\nMilitary and diplomatic historian, Colonel Andrew J. Bacevich, reviewing the book in \"The Washington Post\", wrote: \"[Mayer's] achievement lies less in bringing new revelations to light than in weaving into a comprehensive narrative a story revealed elsewhere in bits and pieces.\" \"Post\" reporter Joby Warrick reported that Mayer's book revealed that a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst warned the Bush administration that \"up to a third of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay may have been imprisoned by mistake.\" The administration ignored the warning and insisted that all were enemy combatants.\n\nIn a story appearing the same day in \"The New York Times\", reporter Scott Shane revealed that Mayer's book disclosed that International Committee of the Red Cross officials had concluded in a secret report in 2007, that \"the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes.\"\n\nMayer said of her book: \"I see myself more as a reporter than as an advocate.\"\n\nMayer covered the Obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers with an article about former National Security Agency (NSA) official Thomas Drake. Despite Obama's campaign promises of transparency, Mayer wrote, his administration \"has pursued leak prosecutions with a surprising relentlessness.\" She won the Polk Award for the article, and the judges said her article helped expose \"prosecutorial excess\" and \"helped lead to all major charges against Drake being dropped.\"\n\nIn 2009, Mayer covered the Obama administration's use of drones. \"The number of drone strikes has risen dramatically since Obama became President\", she wrote. Her article described errors, ethical concerns, and potential unintended consequences in the increased use of drone strikes.\n\nFor more than a decade, Mayer has written about money in politics, covering and criticizing both liberals and conservatives. In 1997, she wrote an article about \"dubious Democratic Party fundraising tactics leading to the 1996 election.\" The article described how the Clinton campaign \"marketed the prestige and glamour of the Presidency as never before.\"\n\nIn 2004, she wrote an article on George Soros and other activist billionaires who sought \"to use their fortunes to engineer the defeat of President George W. Bush in the 2004 election.\" The article described Soros's \"extreme measures\" and how his \"outsized financial role in the election\" had \"stirred alarm\".\n\nIn 2010, Mayer published an article about the political activities of the Koch brothers, describing their \"war against Obama\" and funding of the Tea Party and nonprofit organizations that sought to block liberal policy proposals and defeat Democratic candidates. The article was a finalist for the 2011 National Magazine Awards.\n\nIn 2011, Mayer reported on retail sales millionaire Art Pope's dominant spending in North Carolina politics. It documented his extraordinarily successful efforts as a Koch brothers ally, who held seats on the boards of their Americans for Prosperity and Citizens for a Sound Economy organizations, to target both Democrats and moderate Republican state legislators and it predicted the redistricting-generated loss of Democratic congressional delegation seats. Her article won a Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, and the judges called it \"the kind of journalism that strengthens democracy and shows the value of a free press.\" Mark Bauerlein, writing in the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\", was critical of the piece, saying the article was \"a tendentious, poorly-researched, and weakly argued bit of journalism\" and that \"Pope never gets a fair shake.\" In response to criticism, Mayer supplemented her article with a blog entry pointing out that, despite Pope's claims that he was \"not an heir\", his \"political career was launched\" by more than $300,000 from his parents.\n\nIn 2012, Mayer wrote an article about President Obama's efforts to raise money from liberal billionaires, and the decision of his campaign to flip-flop and encourage fundraising from super PACs.\n\nFollowing the 2016 election cycle, Mayer covered in the New Yorker, the exertion of considerable influence of former Democratic strategist and pollster Patrick Caddell, in his capacity as advisor to reclusive contributor Robert Mercer. Hedge fund director Mercer, joined in his efforts by his daughter Rebekah, has been an increasingly important source of substantial funding for right wing campaigns, including the successful candidacy of Donald Trump.\n\nIn 2016, Doubleday published Mayer’s fourth book, \"Dark Money\", which became an instant national best-seller, and the New York Times named it one of the ten best books of the year. The New York Review of Books described it as “absolutely necessary reading for anyone who wants to make sense of our politics,” and Esquire Magazine called Mayer, “quite simply one of the very few, utterly invaluable journalists this country has.” In interviews about her book, Mayer revealed that approximately six investigators, led by former New York Police Chief Howard Safir, had been hired by the industrialist Koch brothers in an effort to try to dig up dirt in order to smear her reputation, and that accusations of plagiarism had been leveled at her. She responded by publicly airing those tactics of intimidation, effectively debunking the smear campaign. Dark Money won the 2017 Helen Bernstein Award, and was a finalist for the PEN Jean Stein Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize.\n\nOn May 7, 2018, within hours of publication of an article co-written by Mayer and fellow reporter Ronan Farrow in \"The New Yorker\", that New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, during his term in that office, had physically abused at least four women with whom he had been romantically involved, and he had habitually abused alcohol and prescription drugs, he resigned, effective May 8, 2018. Mayer and Farrow had reported that they had confirmed the women's allegations both with photographs of contusions, as well as with statements from friends with whom the alleged victims had confided subsequent to the claimed assaults. Though he denied the allegations, Schneiderman stated he resigned because they \"effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work\". Governor Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the filing of possible criminal charges against Schneiderman.\n\nMayer has appeared as a guest on the \"Charlie Rose Show\", as well as on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". She was also a guest on the \"Bill Moyers Journal\" show on PBS in 2008, and appeared as a guest on PBS \"Tavis Smiley show\" on August 7, 2008, to discuss her book \"The Dark Side\", which had just made \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. She appeared as a guest on the Comedy Central's \"Colbert Report\" on August 12, 2008.\n\nOn January 26, 2009, Mayer was interviewed at the Yale Law School Law and Media lecture series by Linda Greenhouse, Distinguished Journalist in Residence, and Emily Bazelon, Truman Capote Fellow in Creative Writing. In October 2008, Mayer participated in a panel discussion of journalists at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, devoted to the media's coverage of the Iraq War. That same month Mayer participated as a panelist in a discussion of the same subject at the Newseum in Washington, D.C..\n\nAlthough not a personal appearance by Mayer, the FOX show \"24\" had a minor character in its seventh season named Blaine Mayer. The character was named after Jane Mayer, who wrote, \"\"Well, there's kind of a balancing sensation. The elevation to the U.S. Senate is a nice start to the year, but the sex change is a bit disappointing, since if I have to be male, I was hoping for a younger, more fit body, and a better head of hair. It does however fulfill one of my greatest fantasies, which is that I have long had subpoena envy.\"\n\nMayer has appeared frequently on Free Speech TV's \"Democracy Now!\" program. On February 17, 2016, she was interviewed by American University journalism professor Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, at a public discussion of her career and \"Dark Money\" that was broadcast on C-Span.\n\nMayer was awarded the 2008 John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism for her investigative report leading to her book \"The Dark Side\". The Award, presented annually by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, is given to reporters for \"distinguished cumulative accomplishments.\" In presenting the award, Nicholas Lemann, dean of the journalism school and one of the nine members of the award committee, noted that Mayer and her fellow winner, Andrew C. Revkin (science reporter for \"The New York Times\") \"set the gold standard for journalists, and we have benefited tremendously from their dedication and hard work.\" She also has won the Ridenhour Book Prize and the New York Public Library's Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism.\n\nMayer was a finalist in the National Magazine Awards for 2007 for her nonfiction piece in \"The New Yorker\" entitled \"The Black Sites\", which was subsequently collected in \"The Best American Magazine Writing 2008\", published by Columbia University Press, and edited by Jacob Weisberg.\n\nIn 2008, Mayer was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in connection with her work on her third book, \"The Dark Side\". In 2009 Mayer was awarded the Hillman Prize, the Shorenstein Center's Goldsmith Book Prize for trade book of the year, and the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize for \"The Dark Side\".\n\nShe received the Edward Weinthal Award from Georgetown University, in 2009, and the James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism in 2010.\n\nMayer was awarded the George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting in 2011 for her investigative reporting on the relentless United States Department of Justice prosecution of NSA whistleblower Thomas Andrews Drake. Mayer's article in The New Yorker told the story of how Drake faced up to 35 years in federal prison for communicating non-classified information about an NSA surveillance program known as \"Trailblazer\" to Baltimore Sun reporter Siobahn Gorman, who wrote a prize-winning article about it. Drake had been arrested after an investigation meant to identify the source for the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 New York Times report on warrantless wiretapping, Neither Drake nor any other NSA employee had actually been the story's source. After Mayer's story was published, the prosecution dismissed all 10 felony charges against Drake. He pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of violating rules regarding the retention of classified materials. \n\nIn 2012, Mayer received the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting for her coverage of North Carolina state politics.\n\nMayer married William B. Hamilton, also a journalist, in 1992. Hamilton is the former national editor at \"The Washington Post\" and former Washington editor for \"The New York Times\". Hamilton's father was a foreign correspondent and U.N. bureau chief for \"The Times\", and his grandfather was the editor and publisher of \"The Augusta\" (Georgia) \"Chronicle\" and a member of the Democratic National Committee. Their daughter Kate Hamilton was the 2015 winner of the Truman Scholarship from Washington, D.C. Mayer is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and a steering board director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press.\n\n\n"}

Previously, final official results had shown him as the winner of the November 2016 election.\n\nJovenel Moïse was born to a middle-class family in Trou-du-Nord, Nord-Est. He is the son of Etienne Moïse, a merchant, and Lucia Bruno, a seamstress.\n\nIn July 1974, his family moved to Port-au-Prince, where he attended the Don Durélin National School, the Lycée Toussaint Louverture, and the Cultural Center of the Collège Canado-Haïtien. He studied political science at Université Quisqueya and married Martine Marie Etienne Joseph, a classmate, in 1996. That year, he left the capital and moved to Port-de-Paix with the goal of developing rural areas.\n\nWith little investment capital, Moïse created his first business in Port-de-Paix: JOMAR Auto Parts, still in operation today.\n\nShortly after, he began a project to provide clean water to rural areas. In 2001, he partnered with Culligan, a company based in Port-au-Prince. With loans from financial institutions and individuals, he opened a water plant serving the departments of Nord-Ouest and Nord-Est.\n\nIn 2004, Moïse became a member of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Northwest (CCINO). Soon after, he was elected president of CCINO. He later became secretary general of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti (CCIH), where he helped increase the representation of the regional Chambers of Commerce within the national organization.\n\nIn 2008, he helped found the Haitian Energy Company SA, which aims to bring solar and wind power to 10 communes in Nord-Ouest.\n\nIn 2012, in Trou-du-Nord, he founded Agritrans SA and helped create Haiti's first agricultural free trade zone, a banana plantation spread out on nearly 1,000 hectares of land in Nord-Est. This led to more than a dozen agricultural projects that created almost 3,000 direct jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs.\n\nIn 2015, President Michel Martelly designated Moïse as the presidential candidate of the political party Martelly founded, the Haitian Tèt Kale Party (PHTK).\n\nIn his campaign, Moïse promoted bio-ecological agriculture as an economic engine for Haiti, whose population is over 50% rural. He also expressed support for policies pursued by Martelly: universal education and health care, energy reform, rule of law, the creation of sustainable jobs, environmental protection, and development of Haiti as a destination for ecotourism and agritourism.\n\nMoïse received 32.8% of votes in the first round of the 2015 elections held on 15 October 2015, qualifying for a runoff with the second-place finisher, Jude Célestin. However, an exit poll conducted by the \"Haiti Sentinel\" showed Moïse receiving only 6% of the vote, and many observers called the results fraudulent. Thousands of people took to the streets in violent protest, forcing the postponement of the runoff election.\n\nOn 27 November 2016, election officials said Moïse had won the 2016 election in the first round based on preliminary results, with an estimated voter turnout of 21%.\n\n\"Note: Table abridged as there are too many candidates.

She served as the bookkeeper for the Committee for the Re-Election of the President.\n\nMiller was born in Pennsylvania, the daughter of Lois (née Litchfield; 1899-1955) and Charles Luther Graham (1895-1951). Her father was an athletic coach at West Chester University with its swimming pool named in his honor. He had served in World War I and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery with her mother. She has two brothers, Ross Graham and David Graham (d. 2013).\n\nMiller was married and had a daughter Kelly with her first husband James Hoback (1938-1970), who died of a heart attack. In 1984 she married Grover Miller, owner of the firm \"H & M Marketing\" for which she worked as the accountant. Miller is retired and lives in Florida with her second husband. Her daughter is a teacher.\n\nMiller (then Hoback) was working as the bookkeeper for Richard Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972 when Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein contacted her for information. Woodward has stated that she was just as important as Deep Throat for unveiling the Watergate Scandal, because she had knowledge about where money was going and who it was coming from.\n\nHobeck was one of the few people who would talk freely with Woodward and Bernstein, allowing them to come to her home, although she has stated she was \"pretty nervous and scared\" and was also \"frustrated that the truth wasn't coming out\". She had already notified the FBI and felt they were not handling the investigation properly. She revealed to Woodward and Bernstein that evidence of financial misconduct had been destroyed, and some of the committee members including G. Gordon Liddy and Jeb Stuart Magruder were receiving payouts from a secret fund. This information advanced the investigation that lead to Richard Nixon's resignation from the office of President of the United States.\n\nIn the 1976 film \"All the President's Men\", actress Jane Alexander portrayed Judy Hoback, who is referred to as \"The Bookkeeper\" in the screenplay. Alexander met with Hoback to prepare for the role, and the production rented Hoback's former home for her character's scenes. Some historians have criticized the film for downplaying the importance of Hoback's role in the scandal. Jane Alexander was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.\n"}

She is the daughter of the founding North Korean leader Kim Il-sung and the sister of the late leader Kim Jong-il. She currently serves as Secretary for Organization of the Workers' Party of Korea. An important member of Kim Jong-il's inner circle of trusted friends and advisors, she was director of the WPK Light Industry Department from 1988 to 2012. Her husband was Jang Sung-taek, who was executed in December 2013 in Pyongyang, after being charged with treason and corruption.\n\nKim Kyong-hui was born in Pyongyang on 30 May 1946, the youngest child of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-suk. Her birth mother died when she was four. After her father remarried, she was raised by various surrogates away from the family.\n\nAfter a brief period spent in Jilin Province, China due to the Korean War, she returned to Pyongyang with her brother, Kim Jong-il. She entered Kim Il-sung University in 1963, studying political economy, where she met her future husband. The couple continued dating after he relocated to Wonsan, allegedly because the Kim family opposed their relationship. The two eventually married in 1972. She attended the Kim Il-sung Higher Party School in 1966, and went to study at Moscow State University in 1968. \n\nKim and Jang had a daughter, Jang Kum-song (1977–2006), who lived overseas in Paris as an international student; she refused an order to return to Pyongyang and then reportedly committed suicide in September 2006 due to her parents' opposition to her relationship with her boyfriend.\n\nKim Kyong-hui's political career began in 1971 with a position in the Korean Democratic Women's Union, and in 1975 she was transferred to the post of vice-director of the International Liaison Department of the Workers' Party of Korea, promoted to first vice-director in 1976. It was the period when North Korea was establishing diplomatic relations with a number of capitalist countries, like Thailand and Singapore, as well as the United Nations. She oversaw the placement of qualified diplomatic personnel during her tenure as International Department vice-director.\n\nIn 1988, she was promoted to WPK Central Committee member and director of the Light Industry Department. In 1990, she was elected deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly for the first time. Her role was particularly significant as she led the Economic Policy Inspection Department, then again the Light Industry Department during the \"Arduous March\" period after Kim Il-sung's death. \n\nKim Kyong-hui disappeared from the limelight in 2003, in the same period when Jang Sung-taek was apparently purged as well. However, while her husband resurfaced with a high-level position in 2007, she did not appear in public until 2009, playing a more and more prominent role, accompanying Kim Jong-il to several inspection tours and attending official events. On 27 September 2010, it was announced that she was made a general in the Korean People's Army, the first woman in North Korea to achieve this military rank. This coincided with her nephew Kim Jong-un's promotion to the same rank. A day later, the 3rd Conference of the Workers’ Party elected her as a member of the Political Bureau, which is the central organization of the party. Kim Kyong-hui later continued to pose as a prominent member of the North Korean leadership under Kim Jong-un. She was elected member of the WPK Secretariat and a leading figure of the WPK Organization and Guidance Department (the foremost party department led by her uncle Kim Yong-ju until 1974, and by Kim Jong-il himself from 1974 till his death) at the 4th Party Conference in April 2012. \n\nAccording to South Korean sources, she also worked as Kim Jong-il's personal aide. Her influential position in North Korean echelons (also confirmed by Kenji Fujimoto) allowed her to maintain close relations with president Kim Yong-nam of the SPA Presidium, WPK Secretaries Choe Thae-bok and Kim Ki Nam, and Director Kim Yang-gon of the WPK United Front Department. Her post as head of the Light Industry Department gave her a prominent role in shaping North Korean economic policy as it was shifting its focus on developing light industry.\n\nIn 2010, Kim Kyong-hui opened the first hamburger restaurant in Pyongyang.\n\nOn 8 December 2013, her husband, Jang Sung-taek was publicly expelled from the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. Jang was accused of factionalism, corruption, and a range of misbehaviour that included affairs with other women. On 13 December, it was reported that he had been executed for treason.\n\nOn 14 December, the Korean Central News Agency released a roster of six top officials appointed to a national committee in charge of organizing a state funeral for Kim Kuk-tae, a former Workers' Party official. The roster included the name of Kim Kyong-hui, indicating she had survived the purge and remained in favour. The status of Kim Kyong-hui's relationship with Jang had been a subject of frequent speculation. Analysts believe that Jang and Kim Kyong-hui had been estranged. Yoon Sang-hyun, a National Assembly of South Korea deputy floor leader of the governing Saenuri Party, said that Kim had been \"separated\" from Jang and did not oppose his purge.\n\nIn recent years, Kim Kyong-hui has been rumored to be either dead or very ill. According to a report by the \"Daily NK\" in August 2012, she has suffered from ill health due to alcoholism. According to Paul Fischer, who wrote \"A Kim-Jong-Il Production\", she has suffered from this disease every so often since at least the late 1970's. This has prompted at least one rehab trip into China for treatment. At this time, it has been suggested that she has had a fatal stroke or a heart attack. According to a defector, the alleged stroke came just days after Jang's execution when Kim Kyong-hui was on the phone with Kim Jong-un discussing the killing. Some reports claim she has committed suicide. According to other reports, she underwent surgery for a brain tumour in 2013 and was left in a vegetative state. In 2015, an unnamed source, described as a high-ranking defector, claimed that Kim Jong-un had ordered Kim Kyong-hui to be poisoned. In February 2015 the South Korean National Intelligence Service stated she was still alive.

He was the sixth of ten children (one died on the day of birth), born to Elbert Weston Ott (1855-1924) of Mount Hermon, Louisiana, who was of German and French descent, and the former Martha Estelle Leggett (1860-1955, a native of Mississippi. His father was engaged in the mercantile and planting businesses and instituted the post office in Mount Hermon. Young Ott worked in his father's store and office and became self-educating in the field of accounting. The senior Ott was known for his strong support for prohibition of alcoholic beverages.\n\nIn 1918, Ott moved to New Orleans to enter the accounting firm of Smith and Skinner. In 1921, he formed his own company, Ott and Prados. He was active in the Masonic lodge and the Young Men's Business Club.\n\nIn 1940, Ott was elected to one of the eight state Senate slots from Orleans Parish. He served during the administrations of Governors Sam H. Jones and Jimmie Davis. He resigned in 1945 early in his second term. The next year, he was elected commissioner of finance on the New Orleans City Council under the city commission government. He was reelected as finance commissioner in 1950. The mayor at the time of Ott's two council terms was deLesseps Story Morrison, a subsequent three-time candidate for governor.\n\nIn 1952, Ott joined the ticket of gubernatorial candidate James M. McLemore a cattleman from Alexandria in Central Louisiana, in an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor. Much of the campaigning was conducted in the last few months of 1951. While Robert F. Kennon won the governorship, C. E. \"Cap\" Barham of Ruston, the choice of gubernatorial candidate Hale Boggs, the U.S. representative from Louisiana's 2nd congressional district, was placed into a runoff election with the later Governor John McKeithen for the second position. Barham prevailed and served one term until his own defeat in 1956 by the educator Lether Frazar.\n\nOtt was twice married; his wives were the former Helen Merritt and Carolyn McCormick (1912-2007). He had no children. He is interred beside his second wife at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.\n\nOtt's papers are housed at the New Orleans Public Library.\n"}

He's also a large shareholder of the real estate Notias Constructions Company, Director of Operations of Cardiff Holdings Inc., Director of Operations of Liverpool Holdings Inc., and until June 2013, the major shareholder and Vice President of the famous Greek football club AEK Athens.\n\nSon of the late Harry N. Notias and Phyllis Thravalos, he had a beloved sister named Irene. His father, \"Captain Harry\" as he was fondly known, immigrated in the early 1940s from the Greek island Chios and became a US citizen. He was a selfmade man who achieved the American dream. He came from a close-knit family of modest means, became a Captain in the U.S. Maritime Service and later founded a successful shipping business, Independence Maritime Agency Inc., with offices in New York and Greece. Nicholas followed his father roots and values, and after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (1988) and a Master of Business Administration (1990) from Fordham University, took over the family business. Nikos Notias is married to Maria C.

Yachting industry experience for motor yachts including brokerage, construction and transport. Also expert in chartering of a fleet of dry bulk carriers engaged in the international transport of bulk commodities world wide.\n\n\nWith AEK struggling terribly in corruption and the prospect of relegation to the fourth division looming, Demis Nikolaidis (ex club charismatic player) supported by the majority of AEK fans, established a consortium of businessmen such as Polys V. Hajioannou, Petros Pappas and Takis Kanellopoulos, who convinced Nikos Notias to participate in the project. The approach was made by Ghikas Goumas, grandson of the late Nikos Goumas (former President of the Club). At the first contact, which was held in New York City, Nikos Notias was convinced that the operators had pure purposes, and a great vision for the clubs regeneration. Small doubts initially led Notias to take a small percentage of shares (about 8%) but he changed his mind quickly, when he realized that the fans totally backed-up the effort and gradually, over a period of three and a half years, he became the major holder of the shares, reaching 35%. His financial assistance to the club amounts to 18 million euros but the largest and most expected project of Nikos Notias, remains the clubs Sports Center which will cost over 25 million euros. It will be the biggest project in the modern history of the club and Notias's intention is to name it \"Harry Notias\" in honour of his father. Among the tremendous economic crisis in Greece and due to the clubs financial problems, AEK Athens in June 2013 declared bankruptcy and was self-relegated to the amateur third division. The Athletic Center of Spata nowadays includes state of the art facilities, three fields (one of them with synthetic turf) for soccer, a fitness and health center with weight-training and fitness rooms, a cryotherapy center and more. Unfortunately, the rest of the project (the clubs Museum, Hotel, Aquatic Center and two more soccer fields) could not be delivered and remained unfinished.\n"}

It was based on the play of the same name by Jerry Sterner. The film adaptation was directed by award winner Norman Jewison, and written by Alvin Sargent.\n\nLawrence \"Larry the Liquidator\" Garfield (Danny DeVito) is a successful corporate raider who has become rich buying up companies and selling off their assets. With the help of a computerized stock analyzing program called \"Carmen\", Garfield has identified New England Wire & Cable Company as his next target. The struggling company is run by the benevolent and folksy Andrew \"Jorgy\" Jorgenson (Gregory Peck) and is the primary employer in its small Rhode Island town in New England. The company is doing okay and stock is rising.\n\nGarfield decides to take over the company. After Jorgy learns that he has filed a Schedule 13D report, and after stubbornly insisting that no outsider can seize control of a business his father began, Jorgy is finally persuaded to hire his stepdaughter Kate (Penelope Ann Miller), a big-city lawyer, to defend against a hostile takeover. Garfield is instantly smitten with the beautiful Kate, although he is on to her tactics and does not waver from his goal of becoming the majority stockholder of New England Wire & Cable. Garfield tactlessly and unsuccessfully tries to seduce her. Despite their antagonism, Kate finds herself attracted to Garfield's bold nature.\n\nThe takeover attempt begins to fracture the New England Wire & Cable Company family. Kate's mother Bea (Piper Laurie) secretly travels to Garfield's offices to offer one million dollars in greenmail to Garfield if he'll go away, but he refuses, stating, \"I don't take money from widows or orphans.\" Trusted company president Bill Coles (Dean Jones), fearful that the takeover will leave him with nothing, offers to let Garfield vote his shares in the company in exchange for a million-dollar payout. Garfield agrees, but specifies that Coles will get only half as much if his shares fail to make up the margin of victory.\n\nGarfield concedes to Jorgy's offer to let the matter be settled at the annual shareholder's meeting. Relying on the support of longtime friends and investors, Jorgy makes an impassioned plea to save the company, appealing to the traditions of manufacturing as opposed to the new breed of capitalism which Larry the Liquidator represents, in which buyers of companies create no products or jobs and are interested only in money. The shareholders seem swayed by Jorgy's speech and boo Garfield when he gets up to give a rebuttal.\n\nIn his rebuttal, Garfield compares New England Wire & Cable to the last buggy whip manufacturer, arguing that even though the company's product may be high quality, changing technology has rendered it obsolete. Rather than running a failing business into the ground, he contends that the shareholders should follow his lead and get what value they can from the stock before the company's inevitable demise. At least when this company is liquidated, he says, they'll end up with a few dollars in their pocket.\n\nWhen the vote is taken, the shareholders agree to give Garfield controlling interest in the company. The margin of victory is greater than Coles' shares and thus he does not receive the full amount he betrayed Jorgy to get.\n\nBack at home in Manhattan, Garfield finds himself uncharacteristically despondent after his victory, having realized he has lost his chance for a romance with Kate. Just then, Kate calls. She's been having discussions with a Japanese automaker that wants to hire New England Wire & Cable to manufacture stainless steel wire cloth for making automobile airbags, something which will make the company profitable again on a new expanding industrial product. An excited Garfield invites her to dinner to discuss it.\n\n\nSome of the scenes that take place inside the factory were shot in the now defunct \"Seymour Specialty and Wire\" in Seymour, Connecticut. Also Known As: Reactive Metals Inc., National Distillers and Chemical Co. and Bridgeport Brass Co., Seymour, Connecticut. Other scenes were shot in the (also defunct) Gilbert and Bennett mill in Georgetown, Connecticut.\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews, with a 31% rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes based on 16 reviews. Roger Ebert of \"The Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, but said 'I didn’t like the very last scene of “Other People’s Money.” It felt tacked on, manufactured, concocted out of a Hollywood studio’s knee-jerk need to provide a smileyface ending that was not in the spirit of the film'. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" said of Sargent's adaptation, 'culminates in a speechy but effective debate about the merits of old-fashioned business versus the corporate takeover,' but still felt that the film was 'too genial to be hard-hitting.'\n\n"}

Weil is best known as being the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Global Wealth Management & Business Banking at UBS AG. Weil eventually became a member of UBS's Group Executive Board.\n\nDuring Weil’s tenure at UBS, the Bank became embroiled in the 2008-09 U.S. tax evasion controversy, which led to Weil’s voluntary departure from the Bank after he was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly offering help to thousands of UBS’s U.S. clients who failed to pay their federal income taxes. Arrested in October 2013 during a trip to Italy, Weil has been extradited to the United States. On December 16, 2013, Weil was released on $10.5 million bail by the federal district court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The trial began in Ft. Lauderdale on October 14, 2014 and the jury found him not guilty on November 3, 2014.\n\nWeil was born in Switzerland. Weil graduated from the University of Basel with a degree in economics. He also earned a masters in economics with a specialization in national economics and business administration.\n\nRaoul Weil is a member of the Optimus Foundation, a charitable foundation administered by UBS which helps with disease prevention and education across the world. In 2008, Weil was elected chairman of the Optimus Foundation’s board, pledging the foundation to the goal of becoming the largest charitable organization in Switzerland in the next decade.\n\nIn September 2008, Weil led the Global UBS Philanthropy Forum, which brought together philanthropists, business leaders, social entrepreneurs, and representatives from civil society from around the world to consider the theme of “Building Change Communities.”\n\nAfter he finished active duty in the Swiss military in 1984, Weil was hired by the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), and worked in SBC's private banking division in Basel, Zurich, Monaco, New York City, and Hong Kong from 1984 until 1998. When SBC and UBS merged in 1998, Weil joined UBS as part of its private banking division for Asia and Europe, becoming head of UBS's Wealth Management International unit in 2002. In July 2007, Weil became CEO of WM&BB.\n\nOn November 12, 2008, Weil voluntarily relinquished his duties with UBS to focus on his defense after being indicted in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS's US cross-border business by the United States Department of Justice. The United States issued an international arrest warrant for Weil in 2008.\n\nOn May 23, 2008, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (EBK, the predecessor to FINMA) opened an investigation into UBS’s role in facilitating tax evasion by its US clients. The EBK concluded, among other things, that UBS’s “top management” was not aware of the Bank’s US clients’ fraudulent conduct, and were not “accessories or accomplices” to UBS’s violations. The EBK also found that the US cross-border business’s managers at the time – Martin Liechti and Michel Guignard – were the principal architects of UBS’s wrongdoing and had actively concealed their misconduct from Weil.\n\nAfter leaving UBS, Weil was hired as a consultant in 2010 by Reuss Private Group (Pfäffikon, Schwyz, Switzerland), eventually becoming a managing partner. At the beginning of 2013, he succeeded Adriano B. Lucatelli as chief executive officer of Reuss Private Group. In February 2013, FINMA granted Reuss a license to deal in securities and certified that Reuss management, including Weil, was engaged in “proper business conduct” (Gewähr für eine einwandfreie Geschäftstätigkeit). As part of the application process, Weil confirmed in writing that he had not concealed anything with respect to the US-UBS tax dispute.\n\nOn December 2, 2013, Weil was replaced by Felix Brem as CEO of Reuss Private Group.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation began probing a multimillion-dollar tax evasion case involving UBS due to disclosures made by Brad Birkenfeld, a former UBS banker in Switzerland, who was arrested entering the United States and cooperated with the US Department of Justice, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and the US Internal Revenue Service. Concurrently, a United States Senate subcommittee accused Swiss banks, including UBS, of helping wealthy Americans evade taxes through offshore accounts, which it estimated cost of the U.S. excess of US$100 billion annually.\n\nIn response, UBS announced that it would cease providing cross-border private banking services to US-domiciled clients through its non-US regulated units as of July 2008.\n\nAs part of its investigation into the conduct of UBS’s US cross-border business, DOJ demanded client banking records from UBS. Under Swiss bank secrecy laws, UBS was prohibited from turning over such documents. The Swiss government interceded and began negotiating with DOJ in an effort to persuade DOJ to stop trying to force UBS to violate Swiss law. On November 6, 2008, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Raoul Weil in connection with the ongoing investigation of UBS, and DOJ obtained an order from the court there placing the indictment under seal. On November 10, 2008, Swiss Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz and Head of the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulsen asking that DOJ go through the information-sharing provisions of the US-Switzerland Double Taxation Treaty if it wanted to obtain information regarding UBS’s clients. Weil’s indictment was unsealed two days later, on November 12, 2008. According to one high-level Swiss source, “[t]hat was a clear message . . . One can imagine that without the letter they would have at least delayed the indictment of Weil.”\n\nWeil soon thereafter left the Bank to focus on the criminal case. On February 18, 2009, UBS agreed to pay a fine of US$780 million to the U.S. government and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement on charges of conspiring to defraud the United States by impeding the Internal Revenue Service. Weil’s charges were not dismissed as part of UBS’s deal, and he continued to face charges even after UBS had settled its criminal case and a subsequent dispute with the US government and IRS in the Fall of 2009, which resulted in UBS’s agreeing to turn over thousands of US customer files to the US.\n\nOn 6 January 2014, the National Whistleblowers Center claimed that Weil \"will make a sweetheart deal with the DOJ\" because he has \"information that would be extremely embarrassing to wealthy and powerful people\" in the United States and elsewhere.\" Notwithstanding this claim, no such deal has apparently been reached. Weil is preparing for trial.\n\nWeil was declared a fugitive by Judge James Cohn on January 13, 2009. Weil has maintained his innocence of the charges against him. Weil, who remained in Switzerland, his home country and place of residence, after being indicted, maintains that he did not run from the United States.\n\nOn October 19, 2013, Weil was arrested in Bologna, Italy while on a trip from Switzerland. Weil's request for house arrest was turned down by Italian authorities, and Weil decided not to contest extradition to the United States. Weil's willingness to return to the U.S. raised the suspicion that he may have been offered a \"sweetheart deal\" by the U.S. Department of Justice, which treated another UBS conspirator, Martin Liechti, extremely leniently, according to Bradley Birkenfeld's lawyer, Stephen M. Kohn of the National Whistleblower Center.\n\nBirkenfeld worked several levels below Weil at UBS, and apparently did not know him. According to Kohn, Weil \"knows where all the skeletons are buried. Kohn claims that, \"Weil can clearly bargain inside information he has that could be embarrassing to American officials or institutions for leniency.\"\n\nWeil has said in filings with the court that the wrongdoing was committed by people below him, who concealed their own misconduct from Weil. He has also contended that the EBK investigation and decision exonerating Weil confirm that version of events.\n\nCharged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS in his appearance before the federal district court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on 16, December 2013, Weil was released on bail under house arrest with friends in New Jersey by US Magistrate Judge Patrick Hunt. At his January 7, 2014 arraignment, Weil pleaded not-guilty to helping U.S. taxpayers evade taxes on $20 billion in offshore assets.\n\nThe trial began in Ft. Lauderdale on October 14, 2014 and the jury found him not guilty on November 3, 2014. Jurors deliberated just over an hour before returning a not guilty verdict. The acquittal is final as prosecution cannot appeal in this case.\n\n"}

She immigrated to the United States in 1883, where the family set up a business which grew into Kosher food manufacturers Horowitz Brothers and Margareten Company. She was profiled several times by \"The New York Times\", and continued to attend the business until two weeks prior to her death.\n\nRegina Margareten was born in Miskolc, Hungary, on either December 20 or 25, 1863, to Jacob Horowitz and his wife Miral Chayah Horowitz (née Brunner), who went by the name of Mary. At birth, Margareten was known as both Rebush and Hannah Rivka. While pregnant, she emigrated with her husband Ignatz Margareten and her parents in 1883 to the United States, where they settled in New York City. They opened a grocery store on the Lower East Side, as they wanted to continue following Orthodox Judaism. The made their own matzoh for their first Passover while in the United States, and this grew over the following years to become the sole object of the family's business in New York, which was known as Horowitz Brothers and Margareten Company.\n\nThe business grew from using a rented bakery in their first year, to having a turnover of more than a million dollars in 1931. Margareten would make checks on the matzoh routinely throughout each day, and proposed the use of wheat from three different American states to improve the quality of the matzoh, and expand the business into other Kosher products. When her husband died in 1923, she became Treasurer of the company. During the 1940s and 50's, she would speak on the local radio just prior to Passover in both Yiddish and English. When the city took over the original business location in 1945, Margareten oversaw the opening of a larger facility in Long Island. Margareten was profiled on several occasions in later life by \"The New York Times\", on her 80th birthday in 1942, on her 91st in 1953 and finally on December 24, 1957. She continued to visit the plant daily until two weeks prior to her death at the age of 96 on January 15, 1959. In her obituary, \"The New York Times\" described her as the \"Matzoh Queen\".\n\nRegina Margareten was the matriarch of the extended family. She owned property near to Hunter Mountain in New York State, and established Margareten Park in Hunter, New York.

Vargas, who only attended in one general assembly of the POC, argued that being an active member does not equate to physical presence in the POC's general assembly. He attempted to have the November 2016 elections postponed by the Pasig Regional Trial Court to allow for dialogue between his camp and Cojuangco's but failed. Cojuangco secured a fourth term unopposed in the 2016 elections.\n\nThe Pasig court later ruled the results of the 2016 elections for the post of president and chairman null and void, said that the commission on elections cannot restrict or qualify the eligibility criteria of being an \"active member\", and ordered and election with Vargas and Tolentino as candidates to be held in February 23, 2018. An extraordinary meeting was held in February where the general assembly agreed to hold elections and a commissions on elections was formed which was also led by Francisco Elizalde. Given the latter fact, Vargas and Tolentino anticipated that they will be disqualified again though Elizalde allowed the two to run to avoid being cited in contempt by court despite the election head's view that the two are ineligible.\n\nVargas secured a 24–15 victory over Cojuangco for the post of POC President ending the latter's long tenure.

Containers may be produced from small, single serve bottles to large containers up to 20-30 liters in volume - but wheel machines are often sized for the volume and dimensional demands of a specific container, and are typically dedicated to a narrow range of bottle sizes once built. Multiple parison machines, with high numbers of molds are capable of producing over one million bottles per day in some configurations.\n\nRotary blow molding \"wheels\" are targeted to the high output production of containers. They are used to produce containers from one to seven layers. View stripe and In Mold Labeling (IML) options are available in some configurations. Rotary wheels, which may contain from six to thirty molds, feature continuously extruded parisons. Revolving sets of blow molds capture the parison or parisons as they pass over the extrusion head. The revolving sets of molds are located on clamp \"stations\".\n\nRotary wheels come in different variations, including both continuous motion and indexing wheels, and vertical or horizontal variations. Wheel machines are favored for their processing ease, due to having only single (or in some cases, two) parisons, and mechanical repeatability.\n\nIn some machinery configurations, the molds take on the shape of a \"pie\" sector. Thus, if two or more parisons are used, each blow molded \"log\" has a unique length, requiring special downstream handling and trimming requirements. In other machine configurations, the molds utilize \"book style\" opening mechanisms, allowing multiple parisons of equal length. However, machines of this style typically have lower clamp force, limiting the available applications.\n\nThe mold close and open actuation is typically carried out through a toggle mechanism linkage that is activated during the rotational process by stationary cams. This mechanical repeatability is considered an advantage by most processors.\n\nThe method of wheel rotation is typically conducted through an electric motor with a \"pinion\" gear or small gear to or in mesh with a rotating \"bull\" gear or large gear. All utilities for blowing containers and for mold cooling are carried through the main shaft or the axle from which the wheel rotates about. These utilities include compressed air and water. Sequencing functions necessary to inflate the parison, hold the container prior to discharge and discharge are completed by mechanical actuation to pneumatic valves – resulting in a high degree of repeatability.\n\nVery tight weight and dimensional tolerances can be obtained on wheel equipment, as the parison is captured on both ends. It is pinched in the preceding mold on the leading end, and positioned by the stationary flowhead die on the other end. In shuttle machinery and reciprocating screw machinery multiple parisons are extruded and are free hanging. Because there is always some variation in the parison length on these machines, bottle weight and tolerance consistencies are not as tight as on rotary wheel machinery.\n\nOther advantages of wheel equipment include:\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThe growth of wheel machinery in the United States was spurred by the conversion of motor oil containers from paperboard cans to plastic bottles, and the conversion of laundry detergent from powder to liquid form. Additional high volume applications have included single-serve juices and drinkable yogurt, condiments, and household cleaning supplies.\n\n"}

Lear served Washington from 1784 until the former-President's death in 1799. Through Lear's journal, we receive the account of Washington's final moments and his last words: \" 'Tis well.\"\n\nTobias Lear also served as third President Thomas Jefferson's envoy to Saint-Domingue (modern-day Haiti), and as peace envoy in the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa during the First Barbary War (1801–1805) and the Second Barbary War (1815). He was responsible for negotiating a peace treaty with the Bey of Tripoli that ended the first Barbary War.\n\nLear was born on Hunking Street in the seaport town of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on September 19, 1762, a fifth-generation American and the fifth generation of his family named Tobias. His parents were Tobias Lear (born August 1, 1737) (cousin of John Langdon) and Mary Stillson Lear (born May 25, 1739). His parents were married on December 29, 1757. The family home on Hunking Street, which still stands today, had been built in 1742 by the Stillson family. Lear had an older sister named Mary (Polly).\n\nBefore going to college, Lear attended Dummer Charity School (now known as The Governor's Academy) where Samuel Moody helped prepare Lear for college. Instead of joining the Continental Army, as many of his contemporaries did, Lear attended Harvard College, beginning in 1779, during the American Revolutionary War. He graduated with 30 classmates in 1783.\n\nHe began his career by being an apprentice until his uncle, Benjamin Lincoln, recommended him for the job of tutoring Martha Washington's grandchildren and to the post of George Washington's personal secretary, both to which he was hired in 1784. He was integrated into Washington's house and his post quickly evolved beyond clerk to being Washington's right-hand man, doing whatever Washington needed, such as tutoring, filling out expense reports, and writing letters. He performed all his duties well.\n\nLear moved with Washington to New York City in 1789, when Washington became president, and they often dined alone together during his presidency. Lear was responsible for filling out Washington's expense reports as president, which Washington had wisely chosen instead of a $25,000 salary, as they turned out to be much more.\n\nIn 1793, at the start of Washington's second term, Lear decided to leave Washington and start out on his own (albeit with help from Washington). He started a company, T. Lear & Company, which focused on two things: working with Washington's Potomac Company to promote river traffic to the soon-to-be nation's capitol and participating in land speculation there. Lear traveled to Europe to sell parcels of land in Washington, DC, but was unsuccessful. His engineering work related to the Potomac Company also failed to enable navigation around two waterfalls on the Potomac River. He lost money in this failed venture despite his wealthy partners.\nLear married Mary (Polly) Long, his childhood sweetheart, in 1790. Together they had a son, Benjamin Lincoln Lear (b. 1791), but Polly died in the President's House in Philadelphia during the 1793 Yellow fever epidemic that claimed around 5,000 people. In 1795, he married Frances Bassett Washington, recent widow of the President's nephew, George Augustine Washington, but Fanny died in 1796 of tuberculosis. Tobias married again, this time to the young Frances Dandridge Henley. His new wife was also nicknamed Fanny and was the niece of Martha Washington.\n\nIn the late 1790s, Lear's finances became more distraught. During this period, he continued to run unpaid errands for Washington. On one of these errands, Lear collected rent from one of Washington's tenants, but pocketed the funds. Washington found out when he questioned his tenant as to why they had not paid. Washington was furious for at least two days but Lear apologized and was quickly forgiven.\n\nThe next year, Lear was given the rank of colonel as chief aide to Washington, who had been reappointed by Congress to command the troops during a period when a French attack was feared. He preferred to be addressed as Colonel Lear for the rest of his life despite the fact that the French never attacked by land and he never faced active duty.\n\nLear collected funds for the sale of a business partner's real estate and kept the funds. He feigned illness for several months before meeting the man and apologizing, confessing and agreeing to reimburse him.\n\nIn 1799, Washington unexpectedly died while Lear was visiting him at Mount Vernon, leading to Lear's famous diary entry:\n\nLear oversaw the funeral arrangements, even to the detail of measuring the corpse at 6 feet 3.5 inches long and 1 foot 9 inches from shoulder to shoulder. Lear inherited a lifetime interest in Walnut Tree Farm.\n\nLear's only biographer, Ray Brighton, was convinced that Lear destroyed many of Washington's letters and diary entries, which he had possession of for about a year after Washington's death. Lear was to work on a Washington biography with Bushrod Washington, a Washington nephew, who had contacted Lear about collecting Washington's papers and collaborating on a Washington biography. Swaths of Washington's diary (especially sections during the presidency and the American Revolutionary War) and a few key letters were discovered missing about a year after their transfer to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, who had instead volunteered to write the biography. Lear denied destroying any papers in a long letter to Marshall; however, Lear's own correspondence casts this into doubt. Lear wrote Alexander Hamilton offering to suppress Washington documents: \"There are as you well know among the several letters and papers many which every public and private consideration should withhold from further inspection.\" Lear explicitly asked Hamilton in that letter if he desired any military papers removed. Suspiciously, almost all the presidential diary entries are gone except for those that covered Washington's 1789 visit to Lear's family home in Portsmouth. Six key Washington letters are also missing.\n\nMany biographers believe that Thomas Jefferson and Washington had a big falling out over a letter Jefferson sent to Philip Mazzei in Italy, which called Washington's administration Anglican, monarchical and aristocratic, and claimed that Washington had appointed as military officers \"all timid men that prefer the calm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty.\" The letter was eventually published overseas and then re-translated back into English by Noah Webster and published in America. Its publication is thought to have sparked a nasty correspondence of three rounds of letters between Jefferson and Washington. In conversation with friends over wine, Lear admitted the existence of the letters but subsequently denied having said such. Albin Rollins, a Mount Vernon overseer, stated to a nephew of Washington that he had seen the letters and that the second round was so strong that it made the hair on his head rise and that a duel must surely follow. The missing letters' loss brought great benefit to Thomas Jefferson, as they would have been fuel for Jefferson's political enemies. Brighton believes (without direct evidence) that Jefferson requested Lear to destroy the letters and that Jefferson rewarded Lear for their destruction for the rest of his life.\n\nJefferson appointed the financially struggling Lear to the potentially lucrative assignment of American commercial agent in Saint-Domingue at the start of his term of president. During this job, Lear appointed Rollins to oversee Walnut Tree Farm. Unfortunately, Lear arrived right before Napoleon Bonaparte was about to clamp down on the slave rebellion there. In a January 17, 1802, in a long letter of gratitude to Jefferson, Lear predicted the long anticipated French response was still six months out. One week later, a French armada arrived at Cape Francois and captured the main port there from Toussaint L'Ouverture. Lear attempted to help the Americans during the ensuing French embargo. However, with the Louisiana Purchase looming large for Jefferson, Lear was asked not to irritate the French commanders, and after a suggestion from James Madison, retreated back to Virginia.\n\nA year after returning to the U.S., in 1803, Jefferson appointed Lear, now 41, to be Consul General to the North African coast with the privilege of simultaneously conducting private business. Before preparing to depart on the \"Philadelphia\" to Algeria, Lear was married for the third time to Frances Dandridge Henley). In a last-minute change, the Lears were reassigned to the \"USS Constitution\", and the \"Philadelphia\" ended up being captured in the Mediterranean. Lear became the primary negotiator for the crew's release in 1805 with the Treaty of Tripoli that ended the First Barbary War in which he was alleged to have mishandled the resolution. The Lears stayed on in Algiers until 1812 when Lear fell out of favor with the \"Dey\".\n\nUpon their return, the U.S. was in the throes of the War of 1812. Consequently, they had to follow a circuitous route back to Portsmouth from their entry in Virginia. Under James Madison, he was then appointed as a secretary to the War Department and moved to a location a few blocks from the White House. While serving in this post, the British attacked and burned the city.\n\nIn 1814, Lear was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.\n\nOn October 11, 1816, Lear apparently committed suicide by shooting himself with a pistol. Although it was known that he suffered severe headaches and stints of depression, as well as being vilified by the media, the specific reasons for his suicide are unknown. It is curious that this \"scrupulous record keeper\" left behind neither suicide note nor will. He is buried in the Congressional Cemetery, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}
