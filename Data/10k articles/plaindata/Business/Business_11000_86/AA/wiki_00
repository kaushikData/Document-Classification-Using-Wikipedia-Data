Annual revenues are around $11 billion, around 1% of GDP. Around 2.5 million people graduate in India every year. Wages are rising by 10–15 percent as a result of skill shortage.\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, American Express consolidated its JAPAC (Japan and Asia Pacific) back office operations into Gurgaon region. This centre (called the Financial Resource Centre East or FRC-E)was headed by an Expat Harry Robertson, a veteran American Express employee with Raman Roy reporting to him, Raman Roy later on quit Amex to join GE and later on started his own enterprise called Spectramind which got later on merged with Wipro and then later on started Quatrro BPO.\n\nIn the 1990s Jack Welch was influenced by K.P. Singh, (a Delhi-based realtor) to look at Gurgaon in the NCR region as a base for back office operations. Pramod Bhasin, the India head of G.E. hired Raman Roy and several of his management from American Express to start this enterprise called GECIS (GE Capital International Services). Raman for the first time tried out voice operations out of India. The operations in India were the Beta site for the GE Six sigma enterprise, as well. The results made GE ramp up their Indian presence and look at other locations. In 2004 GECIS was spun off as a separate legal entity by GE, called Genpact. GE has retained a 40% stake and sold a 60% stake for $500 million to two equity companies, Oak Hill Capital Partners and General Atlantic Partners..\nUntil G.E. most of the work was being done by \"captives\"- a term used for in house work being done for the parent organisation. In 2000 Raman Roy and some team members from GECIS quit, and with VC funding from Chrysalis Capital, started Spectramind. At the same time, an organisation called Efunds started in Mumbai and Gurgaon, vCustomer in New Delhi and Daksh in Gurgaon. One of the current big BPO firms, EXL Services, started in April 1999, and in 2012 hit $442.9 million in revenues.\n\nHowever, recently, most of the Indian BPOs, even smaller and mid-sized ones, are setting up their onshore presence in the markets they serve. Most of the large players are improving the outsourced business processes by leveraging on their years of experience, and now some are offering more than just plain vanilla BPO processes. KPO, transformation and Consulting opportunities are gaining favour among large third party BPO providers like Genpact, Infosys BPM, WNS and EXL Services.\n\nAnalysts believe that India remains a vital destination for outsourcing and expect its annual GDP to grow at 8–10% for the next decade. In addition, outsourcing efforts to India are held up as an effective remedy for concerns about both Chinese government policy and labour force issues, such as increasing costs and shortages.\n\nThe industry has been growing rapidly. It grew at a rate of 38% over 2005. For the FY06 financial year the projections is of US$7.2 billion worth of services provided by this industry. The base in terms of headcount being roughly 400,000 people directly employed in this Industry. The global BPO Industry is estimated to be worth 120–150 billion dollars, of this the offshore BPO is estimated to be some US$11.4 billion. India thus has some 5–6% share of the total Industry, but a commanding 63% share of the offshore component. The U.S $7.2 billion also represents some 20% of the IT and BPO Industry which is in total expected to have revenues worth US$36 billion for 2006. The headcount at 400,000 is some 40% of the approximate one million workers estimated to be directly employed in the IT and BPO Sector.\n\nThe related Industry dependent on this are Catering, BPO training and recruitment, transport vendors (home pick up and drops for night shifts being the norm in the industry), security agencies, facilities management companies.\n\nBPO/KPO/Domestic & International Call Centres/NOC etc. are covered under the 'Other Service Provider' (OSP) Category by the Department of Telecommunications.\n\nThe companies who are providing the 'Applications Services' means providing services like tele-banking, tele-medicine, tele-education, tele-trading, e-commerce, call centre, network operation centre and other IT Enabled Services, by using Telecom Resources provided by\nAuthorised Telecom Service Providers. The 'Telecom Resource' means Telecom facilities used by the OSP including, but not limited to Public Switched Telecom Network (PSTN), Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and /or the telecom bandwidth provided by authorized telecom service provider having valid licence under Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.\nThe 'Company' means a company registered under Indian Companies Act including foreign companies permitted by RBI under Foreign Exchange Management Regulations and registered under Part-XI(Section 591 to 608) of the Companies Act, 1956 for setting up a place of business in India.\n'Domestic OSP' are the OSP providing the Application Services within national\nboundaries. 'International OSP' are the OSP providing the Application Services beyond\nnational boundaries.\n\n(1) Registration may be granted to any company to provide Application Services. These service providers will not infringe on the jurisdiction of other Authorised Telecom Service Providers and they will not provide switched telephony.\n(2) The entities entitled for OSP registration must be a company registered under\nIndian Companies Act,1956.\n(3) A Company may apply for registration to the Authority in the proforma prescribed by the Authority from time to time.\n\nIt is mandatory to get new Registration Number allotted by the Online OSP Registration system for the existing OSP Registrations. In case you have existing registered OSP sites for which you would like to get the new Registration Number from the system please contact Assistant Director General (ADG) of the concerned Telecom Enforcement, Resource and Monitoring Cell (TERM Cell) preferably before applying for the login-id from the system.\n\nTerms and conditions of the OSP registration are available on the DOT website\n\nBangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, NCR, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Pune are Tier I cities that are leading IT cities in India.\n\nWith rising infrastructure costs in these cities, many BPO's are shifting operations to Tier II cities like Nashik, Sangli, Aurangabad (Maharashtra), Mangalore, Mysore, Hubli-Dharwad, Belgaum, Coimbatore, Nagpur, Trichy, Kochi, Trivandrum, Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula, Bhubaneshwar, Jaipur, Visakhapatnam, Raipur and Lucknow.\n\nTier II cities offer lower business process overhead compared to Tier I cities, but have a less reliable infrastructure system which may hamper dedicated operations. The Government of India in partnership with private infrastructure corporations is working on bringing all around development and providing robust infrastructure all over the nation.\n\nThe BPO industry in India has attracted criticism from some observers.\n\n\nAnother point that should be considered while outsourcing, not only to India but any other region, is Intellectual Property Protection. When companies outsource their work, they have to dilute their core knowledge related to process before transferring the diluted knowledge to the outsourcee. If they fail to do this, the outsourcee can learn enough about the outsourcing organization's business to compete with them later by offering similar services in their own country or even multi-nationally.\n\n\n\nArticles\n\nVideos\n"}

{"id": "12092949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12092949", "title": "Donald E. Bently", "text": "Donald E. Bently\n\nDonald E. Bently (October 18, 1924 - October 1, 2012) was a globally recognized authority on rotor dynamics and vibration monitoring and diagnostics, and an American entrepreneur and engineer. He was best known as the founder and former owner of Bently Nevada Corporation where he performed pioneering work in the field of instrumentation for measuring the mechanical condition of rotating machinery. He founded Bently Nevada in October, 1961, and served as its CEO until February, 2002. He sold the company to GE Energy in February, 2002, and in 2017 GE merged it into Baker Hughes. It continues to design, manufacture, and market these products and services under the Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC brand.\n\nFollowing the sale of the company, Bently subsequently remained active in his other family-owned businesses representing a diverse range of interests including rotordynamics, agriculture, biofuels, real estate, externally pressurized fluid bearings, and machinery diagnostics.\n\nBorn in Muscatine, Iowa, Bently served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a Seabee. He attended the University of Iowa, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 1949, followed by a master's degree in Electrical Engineering in 1950. Bently worked as the lead azide and mercury fulminate assembly line engineer at the Iowa Ordnance Plant in Burlington, Iowa. He then worked for North American Aviation and Rocketdyne in California. He later completed graduate-level coursework at UC Berkeley while working for an aerospace company. He experimented the eddy-current sensing technology that was later the foundation of Bently Nevada Corporation.\n\nDuring Bently's brief employment in the aerospace industry in the mid-1950s, he assisted with research into the use of electronic sensing technologies for aircraft control systems. At the time, his employer concluded that there was limited use for the eddy-current technology in aircraft controls. Bently, however, felt the technology showed commercial promise elsewhere and received permission to use it in his own endeavors. In 1956, he left to form Bently Scientific Company, manufacturing and selling eddy-current products via mail order from his garage in Berkeley, California. In 1961, Bently relocated the company to Minden, Nevada, and incorporated it there as Bently Nevada Corporation with three people. \n\nBently's primary application of eddy-current technology was for non-contacting displacement sensors. Often thought of as a type of electronic dial indicator, such sensors are typically used to measure very small distances between the tip of the sensor and a conductive surface, such as rotating shaft. The displacements measured are extremely small, typically on the order of several thousandths of an inch. \n\nInitially, Bently's sensors were sold mainly for laboratory rather than industrial measurements. However, beginning in the early 1960s, users began to experiment with eddy-current sensors for measuring vibration on turbines, compressors, pumps, electric motors, and other turbomachinery. This application proved to be extremely successful, allowing machinery operators a practical method of observing actual shaft vibratory motion for the first time. Soon thereafter, Bently augmented his sensors with monitoring instrumentation that accepted his sensors as inputs and provided simple visual indication of the amount of vibration. Users could set alarm levels for annunication and machine shutdown purposes when vibration levels became excessive. From that time forward, Bently began to focus his company's efforts almost exclusively on instrumentation for rotating machinery condition measurements. \n\nIn 2001, Bently Nevada built a new $30 million, 283,000-square-foot hadquarters outside Minden at Orchard and Buckeye, previously known as Ferris Heights. The new location consolidated operations previously located at eight different locations around Carson Valley. Bently acquired the Buckeye Ranch in 1978, the former location of the Dangberg sheep operation. Bently renamed the location Bently Science Park.\n\nThis specialized focus resulted in substantial growth. When Bently sold Bently Nevada to GE Energy in January 2002 for between $600 million and $900 million, the company had 1,200 people at its headquarters in Minden, Nevada and 2,100 employees worldwide, operated in more than 40 countries, and had global sales exceeding $235 million USD.\n\nBently said he sold Bently Nevada so he could concentrate on other interests.\n\nBently founded other businesses, including Bently Pressurized Bearing Company, which manufactured a bearing that can hold a rotating axle in place. The technology injected highly pressurized air between the bearing and the rotating machinery, preventing the axle from touching the bearing, virtually eliminating friction. \n\nIn 1981, Bently established a pure research organization called Bently Rotordynamics Research Corporation (BRDRC or \"Birdrock\"). BRDRC's objective was to conduct rotordynamic research, furthering the knowledge of rotating machinery behavior, modeling techniques, and malfunction diagnostic methodologies. Its mission was considered complementary to Bently Nevada, with BRDRC focused on understanding how machinery behaved, and Bently Nevada focused on understanding and building instrumentation to measure machinery behavior. \n\nBRDRC made a number of important contributions to the field of rotordynamics such as a better understanding of fluid-induced instabilities, advanced models for understanding shaft crack behavior, insight into rubbing malfunctions between stationary and rotating parts, and enhancement of the rotordynamic equations via introduction of a new variable lambda (λ) which denoted the fluid circumferential average velocity ratio and more accurately modeled hydrodynamic effects. Bently was personally responsible for many of these developments, publishing his work under the auspices of BRDRC. BRDRC also introduced several new data presentation formats, such as so-called \"full\" spectrum plots and \"acceptance region\" trend plots. Its research findings were published extensively in relevant technical journals, and the research that had practical commercial applications often found its way into the Bently Nevada product line. In 2002, BRDRC was sold along with Bently Nevada to GE Energy.\n\nBently founded Bently Agrowdynamics, which focused on environmentally sustainable agricultural practices and innovative uses of renewable resources. The company led reconstruction of Mud Lake Dam which had been damaged during the 1994 Double Springs Flat earthquake. They converted the 100-year-old earth filled dam to a rock filled structure, ensuring a supply of irrigation water for Bently Agrowdynamics’ South Ranch properties and improving the dam's resistance to earthquakes, protecting the surrounding community. \n\nOther businesses included Bently Tribology Services, Bently Biofuels, Gibson Tool and Supply, and RoMaDyn, a mechanical engineering services and diagnostics company. He also held more than of agricultural land in and around Carson Valley, Nevada and numerous real estate holdings in the United States and abroad.\n\nAll of Bently's businesses were privately held, allowing him to focus on a long-term strategy without the pressure of quarterly stockholder reports. This also enabled him to keep his company in the front of his field technologically. He successfully competed against subsidized Japanese companies and from U.S. government-funded entities.\n\nA significant amount of Bently's rotordynamic research efforts were about rotor dynamic stability. In 2001, he established ISCORMA, (International Symposium on Stability Control of Rotating Machinery), a bi-annual industry event. Bently was an active organizer and participant in all ISCORMA conferences until his death.\n\nHis expertise also led to work for NASA. He spent 2½ years studying the area where the oxygen and hydrogen fuel pumps connect to the main engines on the space shuttle following the January 1986 challenger disaster.\n\nBently was a leader of and major financial supporter if The Institute of World Politics. Bently purchased the Marlatt Mansion and two adjacent townhouses for the Institute. For the first 15 years, he rented the building to the Institute for $1.00 per year.

After returning to Finland, he worked for the Finnish State Railways and a gasworks, until he moved to Caucasus to work for Branobel. When he got back to Finland in 1890, he worked in many companies. Bergroth managed the newly re-established Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works in 1895–1900.\n\nBetween 1905 and 1915 Bergroth was board member of Tampere Linen and Iron Industry. As a chairman, he initiated several development projects which grew the company and improved its productivity.\n\nBergroth was married twice. Four of his children lived until adult age.\n\nBergroth's parents were Pihlajavesi chaplain Johan Mikael Bergroth and Emma Lovisa née Cajanus; the father died when Bergroth was just six years old. He did his matriculation exam in Nikolaistad Gymnasium in 1857 and went to study engineering. After getting a scholarship he continued in Hanover Polytechnic School in Prussia in 1858 and graduated engineer in 1860.\n\nBergroth worked for the Royal Prussian Mint in Hanover until 1861, and, upon returning to Finland, for a short time for the Finnish State Railways. Bergroth managed construction of Leppäkoski railway bridge in 1862. In the same year Bergroth was appointed Technical Manager of Helsinki Gas Illumination Company. The company was a private monopoly, that had been granted in 1860 an exclusive permit for street illumination until 1900 in those areas of Helsinki, where it had built the network. Bergroth travelled to Germany and Switzerland for a field trip visiting the local gas works and collecting knowledge. At the time he left the company in 1884, he had become its manager. Bergroth moved to Branobel in Baku, Caucasus, where he got a Technical Manager vacance. Bergroth got back to Finland in 1890, after which he worked for a number of companies. Until 1892 he was inspector in Finnish Sawmills Fire Assistance Association. One of the employers was Nokia, where he worked from 1890 until 1913. By time Bergroth gained reputation as businessman. When Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works was re-established after bankruptcy on 18 November 1895, Bergroth was selected its first manager. During his leadership the company enlarged its premises and invested heavily on facilities and machinery. Considering the limited amount of capital and the market situation, Bergroth's management was successful. He left his position in 1900 but continued as board member after that.\n\nBy the 1880s city of Helsinki had become increasingly dissatisfied on Bergroth's old employer, the gas illumination company, which was unwilling to invest on new light technology and produced gas inefficiently by burning wood. In November 1899 the city took over the gas distribution; Bergroth was appointed to the board of the new City of Helsinki Illumination Works.\n\nIn 1905 Bergroth became board member in Tampere Linen and Iron Industry company and in the following year he became chairman of board. The company underwent thorough renewal under Bergroth's chairmanship, and many of the changes were initiated by him. The company invested on new buildings and machinery for linen production, increasing both capacity and productivity. During the economic upswing prior to First World War, the company invested on production of various yarn types, canvas, sailcloth and plain weave for bedclothes. The investments continued also during the war, when new linen storage and weaving facility were built. Bergroth left the board in 1915.\n\nBergroth was member of Helsinki City Council in 1875–1877, 1880–1882 and 1897–1899. He represented Helsinki bourgeoisie in Diet of Finland in 1882 and 1899. Bergroth took part in number of state committees, Swedish-speaking technical association, voluntary fire brigade activities and charity work.\n\nIn 1864 Bergroth got married to Lydia née von Essen, daughter of professor Carl Gustaf von Essen and Catalina Sofia née Arppe. Between 1865–1871 they got three daughters and four sons. After Lydia Bergroth's death in 1872, he was married to Evelina née Bergroth, whose parents were vicar Carl Edvard Bergroth and Carolina Amalia née Stenbäck. They got one son in 1876. In total, four of Bergroth's children survived until adult age.\n\nBergroth has been characterised as a warm-hearted person.\n"}

He served as the chairman of the Board of Directors of Rwandair until 2017. \nGirma was born in 1943 in Yeka district, Addis Ababa. He attended the Dejazmatch Wondiyirad School and then the Kotebe Teacher's College. He attended the University College of Addis Ababa, then the country's only higher education institution. He was recruited in his second year by the airline. \n\nGirma joined Ethiopian Airlines upon his graduation in 1965. At the time, the airline was dominated by Americans, primarily from TWA, which had assisted in the airline's development. Girma was one of the first Ethiopians to rise in the airline's executive hierarchy. Girma stayed at the airline for nearly three decades, until debates in 1993 between the new Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front government and the airline leadership led to several resignations, including that of Girma.\n\nIn November 2003, Seyoum Mesfin, chairman of Ethiopian Airlines, and then-minister of foreign affairs, offered Girma, then at Gulf Air as head of cargo operations, the position of Ethiopian Airlines' CEO. Girma, then 60, was at first reluctant to take the position, but he eventually relented with the intention for only staying in the post for five years and also serving the carrier without government interference under his leadership. \n\nWhen Girma became CEO in February 2004, Ethiopian Airlines had only twelve jetliners. It carried 1.2 million passengers annually to 42 international and 16 domestic destinations. Girma spent most of 2004 devising a plan with the assistance from the local branch of Ernst and Young. The plan that was formulated was, Vision 2010 that was launched in 2005, however the plan was received with skepticism. Despite this, between 2005 and 2010 the airline grew at an average rate of 25% per annum. The 1.2 million passengers the airline used to carry annually when Girma took office almost tripled and now stood at 3.2 million by the end of the plan. The 12 planes the airline had increased by more than three-fold to 37, and the airline's fleet was one of the youngest globally. The airline went from having one codeshare agreement to becoming as a member of Star Alliance, which it joined in 2011. \n\nUnder Girma, Ethiopian Airlines Girma’s created 1,500 new jobs including 250 for foreigners.The profits the airline has made have significantly raised employees’ incomes, by an average of 167 percent. Ethiopian also increased its presence in other African markets, forming a strategic partnership with the West African ASKY Airlines, in which it has a 45% stake. \n\nAfter he stepped down in 2011 mostly due to conflict with authorities on the investigation of the crashed flight ET 409 which crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, shortly after it departed Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport, killing all 90 people on board and was immediately replaced by Tewolde Gebremariam, he became chairman of the United Insurance Company.

From 2008 to 2013, he served in a number of product management roles at Google in London and California, including Vice President and product spokesman of Google's Android division.\n\nHe was vice president of the Chinese electronics company, Xiaomi, from 2014 to 2017. He is currently Vice President of Virtual Reality at Facebook, which he joined shortly after his departure from Xiaomi.\n\nBarra attended primary and secondary schools at local Colégio Pitágoras in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and in 1995 enrolled at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), majoring in Electrical Engineering. In 1996, Barra transferred to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating with a bachelor's degree in management science and masters in electrical engineering and computer science. He was class president of the class of 2000 and student keynote speaker at MIT commencement 2000.\n\nBarra joined American technology company Google in London in March 2008 as Group Product Manager for the Google Mobile team. In 2010 Barra joined the Android team.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2013, Barra’s role expanded to include product spokesperson for the Android team, speaking at both press conferences and Google I/O, Google’s annual developer-focused conference. Barra’s product involvement included the entire Android ecosystem of software and hardware, including Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean and KitKat operating system launches, the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 smartphones, the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 tablets, and other related products such as Google Now, selected in 2013 as Popular Science’s Innovation of the Year, and Google Voice Search, Google’s speech recognition service. He was promoted to Vice President in 2012.\n\nIn September 2013, Barra left Google for Chinese electronics company Xiaomi, serving as Vice President of International. The move was considered a ‘significant hire’ for Xiaomi, one of the fastest growing manufacturers in China, enhancing international legitimacy to the company by adding a key former Google Android executive to its senior management.\n\nIn December 2013, Barra spoke at LeWeb tech conference in Paris, France about his impressions of the Chinese economy and the opportunity it represented for tech companies such as Xiaomi, citing China's 600 million internet users, high market caps of recent Chinese IPOs, the massive scale of the top Chinese apps' monthly active users, and the size of companies such as Alibaba's Taobao, a shopping site more than double the size of eBay and Amazon combined. The talk was widely cited throughout the industry.\n\nIn February 2014, Barra announced the launch of the new Redmi and Mi3 smartphones in Singapore, then in India. Global expansion outside of China into surrounding emerging markets is a key initiative for Xiaomi, given the company’s business model to release high performance smartphone products at an affordable consumer price, generating revenue not only from the hardware itself, but the software and internet services provided to the consumer. According to Xiaomi co-founder and president Lei Jun, it is \"entirely Barra’s job to figure out which region that we should enter next and how.\" Barra has stated intentions to expand next into various countries.\n\nIn March 2014, Barra visited Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturing company with plants in Brazil and Mexico responsible for assembling products for various tech brands, indicating plans for Xiaomi to expand into Latin America.\n\nIn May 2014, Barra announced the launch of the MiPad, a 7.9 inch tablet. \"We spent four years working up to the point where we thought we had the right hardware design and software capability to build a world-class tablet,\" Barra said. \"We think we are there, finally.\" Barra described the release as part of Xiaomi's overall strategy to expand both its product lineup and into new international markets including Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. Barra also indicated eventual plans to enter the U.S. market.\n\nIn January 2017, Barra announced his departure from Xiaomi. Barra explained his decision had been strongly motivated by a feeling of detachment from his family and the life he had built up in Silicon Valley. \"What I've realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health. My friends, what I consider to be my home, and my life are back in Silicon Valley, which is also much closer to my family. Seeing how much I've left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return.\" \n\nThere are reports that quoted Barra saying that his resignation was prompted by health reasons and some analysts noted that the departure came amid Xiaomi's declining sales in China. On the other hand, global expansion has been successful. Around the time of his resignation, Xiaomi announced that it has exceeded US$1 billion in revenue from the Indian market alone.\n\nHe announced in a Facebook post on 25 January 2017 that he would be joining Facebook as Vice President of virtual reality, writing:\n\n\"I’m excited to share my next adventure as I return to Silicon Valley—in a couple of months I'll be joining Facebook as VP of virtual reality (VPVR!) and lead the Oculus team. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun always says that the highest calling of an engineer is to make technology breakthroughs quickly and readily available to the widest possible spectrum of humanity. That will be my mission at Facebook and I look forward to building the future of immersive technology with Mark Zuckerberg, Brendan Trexler Iribe, Mike Schroepfer, and the visionaries in the Oculus team.\"Based on his early pronouncements, Barra appears to be focusing on the development of standalone VR headsets as well as social VR. During an appearance at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), he described the technology as \"a product category that will help us bring the most number of people into VR and really start unlocking these opportunities for social presence.\" During the event, Barra announced Oculus' standalone VR headset called Oculus Go, with Xiaomi as global hardware partner.\n\nIn 2011, Barra was ranked #23 in Wired Magazine’s Wired 100. In 2013, Business Insider’s Silicon Valley 100 included Barra at #92. Brazil's \"Época\" magazine ranked Barra among the most influential Brazilians in both 2011 and 2013.\n"}

The last Annual Convention took place in September 2016 and included former Greece finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, Lord Norman Lamont of Lerwick, global economist Dambisa Moyo, and Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nOwing to declining ticket and sponsorship revenues the Annual Convention took a year's break in 2017. It will take on a new look in March 2018, with the format and speaker line-up to be confirmed.\n\nIn 2015, the IoD launched the annual Rhondda Lecture, in honour of Viscountess Rhondda, the first female President of the IoD. The lecture celebrates radical thought, leadership, bold ideas and activism. Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister delivered the inaugural lecture in June 2015 at 116 Pall Mall to an audience of politicians, academics, and business leaders. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservative party, gave the 2016 lecture and was interviewed by BBC journalist Laura Kuenssberg at 116 Pall Mall in December.\n\n\"Director\" is a business and lifestyle magazine for business leaders. It is circulated bi-monthly, is free to IoD members and available to purchase through subscription. It contains interviews with business leaders and politicians, updates from the IoD, debates on topical issues, reviews and features. In April 2017 it was announced that the editorial, advertising and production functions of the magazine will be transferred over to SevenC3, a contract publisher. As a result, a number of members of staff were made redundant. This was followed by an announcement in October 2017 that the magazine would be cut back to only six issues per year.\n\nThe IoD is made up of regional divisions and branches across the UK which serve as the local point of contact for IoD members. At the national level, the IoD is governed by a board and a council, which serves as the voice of IoD members.\n\nStephen Martin is the director general, having succeeded Simon Walker in October 2016.\n\nBarbara, Lady Judge became the IoD's first female chairman in May 2015. She promised to champion women and work to boost the number of women in senior executive positions across British business. In September 2018, it was announced that she would be succeeded by Charlotte Valeur.\n\nInternationally there are different organizations with the same target. In Germany, the Deutsches Institut der Aufsichtsräte exists as an active non profit organization.\n\nThe IoD occupy the Grade I listed 116 Pall Mall in London, which is open to members of the IoD, and has rooms and function suites available for commercial hire. The building is owned by the Crown Estate, along with the large collection of artwork that decorates the rooms. Until 1978, the building was run by the United Services Club. The building was designed by John Nash, the 19th-century architect who also designed the Brighton Pavilion and Marble Arch, and constructed between 1826-28.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2014, members also had use of 123 Pall Mall. This was opened as a contemporary meeting space in contrast with the more traditional 116 Pall Mall, and the interiors were created by noted designers Wayne and Geraldine Hemingway. Despite its popularity with members, the building was closed in 2014 as part of cost saving measures.\n\n116 Pall Mall has been used as a location for many films and TV programmes, including \"Gandhi\", \"Foyle's War\", \"Downton Abbey\", \"The Ali G Show\", \"Parks and Recreation\" and \"The Dark Knight\".\n\n"}

The application indicated that the Malaysian company was planning to forward the parts to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Defense and Aviation. The DDTC advised that the application was denied because the Malaysian company was an unreliable recipient of items on the United States Munitions List.\n\nIn January 2004, Humayun formed his own company, Vash International, Inc., to engage in the business of export management for defense and logistic support, including tanks, guided missiles and rocket launchers. Then, on 11 separate occasions between January 2004 and May 2006, Humayun, via Vash International, exported to the Malaysian company Northrop F-5 and F-14 Tomcat fighter jet parts and CH-47 Chinook helicopter parts. According to United States Attorney Michael J. Garcia, it is documented in public reports that the sole customer of F-14 parts is the Iranian Air Force. Neither Humayun nor Vash International applied for or received the export license required to send the parts included in the 11 shipments outside the United States.\n\nHumayun admitted that, at the Malaysian company's request, he undervalued the shipments on his export paperwork so that the Malaysian company could avoid paying Malaysian customs duties. This conduct forms the basis for the mail fraud conspiracy charged. Humayun is also charged with a money laundering conspiracy relating to the Malaysian company's wire transfer payments totaling US$357,085 to Vash International.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald L. Ellis denied a request by a prosecutor to order Humayun held without bail. The judge set bond at US$500,000 and ordered Humayun detained at his home in Lynbrook, New York after Humayun's lawyer, Joyce London, described her client as a \"true New Yorker\" who rarely traveled and had visited Pakistan only once since coming to the United States in 1981.\n\nThe arrest of Jilani Humayun followed action taken against Abdul Qadeer Khan, another Pakistani arms trader, who was also involved in smuggling components to rogue states via Malaysia (see main article: Scomi Precision Engineering nuclear scandal).\n"}

{"id": "13737778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13737778", "title": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians", "text": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians (often abbreviated KUWTK) is an American reality television series that airs on the E! cable network. The show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian–Jenner blended family. Its premise originated with Ryan Seacrest, who also serves as an executive producer. The series debuted on October 14, 2007 and has subsequently become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country. The fifteenth season premiered on August 5, 2018.\n\nThe series focuses mainly on sisters Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian and their half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner. It also features their parents Kris and Caitlyn Jenner (previously known as Bruce Jenner), and brother Rob Kardashian. The significant others of the Kardashian sisters have also appeared on the show, including Kourtney's ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, Kim's ex-husband Kris Humphries, and current husband Kanye West, Khloé's ex-husband Lamar Odom, ex-boyfriend French Montana, and current fiance Tristan Thompson. Caitlyn's son Brody Jenner made appearances in the early seasons, before appearing regularly between the 8th and 11th seasons, along with brother Brandon and Brandon's wife Leah. Kim's friend Jonathan Cheban and Khloé's friend Malika Haqq have also been part of the show.\n\n\"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" has received very poor critical reviews since its premiere. It is often criticized for the high degree of emphasis on the \"famous for being famous\" concept, and for appearing to fabricate some aspects of its storylines. Several critics also noted the show's lack of intelligence. However, some critics recognized the reality series as a \"guilty pleasure\" and acknowledged the family's success. Despite the negative reviews, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians \" has attracted high viewership ratings, becoming one of the network's most successful shows and winning several audience awards.\n\nThe series' success has led additionally to the creation of numerous spin-off series, including: \"Kourtney and Kim Take Miami\", \"Kourtney and Kim Take New York\", \"Khloé & Lamar\", \"Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons\", \"Dash Dolls\", \"Rob & Chyna\", and \"Life of Kylie\". The network has also broadcast several television specials featuring special events involving members of the family and friends.\n\nRobert Kardashian (19442003) and Kristen Mary \"Kris\" Houghton (born 1955) married in 1978, and had four children together: daughters Kourtney (born 1979), Kim (born 1980), and Khloé (born 1984), and son Rob (born 1987). The couple divorced in 1991. In 1994, Robert rose to prominence when he defended O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman during the O.J. Simpson trial. In 1991, Kris married retired Olympic decathlon champion Caitlyn Jenner (born 1949; formerly known as Bruce Jenner before undergoing a gender transition in 2015). Kris and Caitlyn had two daughters together, Kendall (born 1995) and Kylie (born 1997). Robert died in 2003, eight weeks after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer. The Kardashian sisters began appearing in the media spotlight more often. In 2004, Kim became a personal stylist for recording artist Brandy Norwood. She eventually developed into a full-time stylist, and was a personal shopper and stylist for actress Lindsay Lohan. Khloé, Kim, and Kourtney ventured further into fashion, opening a high fashion boutique Dash in Calabasas, California. Throughout Kim's early career, she was involved in some high-profile relationships including Brandy Norwood's brother, singer Ray J, and later, singer Nick Lachey. In 2006, Kourtney starred in her first reality television series, \"\". In February 2007, a home sex video that Kim made with Ray J years earlier was leaked. Vivid Entertainment bought the rights for $1 million and released the film as \"Kim Kardashian: Superstar\" on February 21. Kim sued Vivid for ownership of the tape, but dropped the suit in April 2007 settling with Vivid Entertainment for $5 million. It is often assumed that the release of the sex tape was a major contributor to the rising fame of Kim Kardashian and her family.\n\nThe idea of creating a reality series originated in 2006 when Kris Jenner showed an interest in appearing on a television show together with her family. Jenner commented: \"Everybody thinks that [my children] could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even have to think about. It would be natural.\" Producer Ryan Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, having the popular family-based show \"The Osbournes\" in mind. He hired a camera man to visit the Kardashian's family home to film them having a Sunday barbeque: \"They were all together as crazy and as fun as loving as they are,\" Seacrest described the family after seeing the tape. He later initiated the series by sharing the tape with E!, an American cable network which features mostly entertainment-related programming, and reality television series; the show was eventually picked up. In August 2007, it was announced that the Kardashian and Jenner families would star in a yet-to-be-titled reality show on E! described as a \"new non-scripted family sitcom\", being produced by Ryan Seacrest and Bunim/Murray Productions. The series' announcement came one week after Paris Hilton and her friend Nicole Richie announced that their popular E! series, \"The Simple Life\", was ending.\n\nThe show, entitled \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\", premiered on October 14, 2007. The reality series centers around the members of the Kardashian-Jenner blended family, focusing on the sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloé. Most episodes have very similar structure: the family \"show[s] off their privileged lifestyle and maybe get into one or two minor family squabbles before ultimately wrapping things up with a monologue that reinforces the importance of family,\" as noted by Caroline Siede of \"Quartz\". Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the reality series as a: \"Hollywood version of \"The Brady Bunch\" -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections\". Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, \"When we first started [the show], we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'\". She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network \"has never once put anything out there that we haven't approved of or accepted\". The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: \"At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another […] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain.\"\n\nThe following year, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" was picked up for a third season. In April 2012, E! signed a three-year deal with the Kardashian family that kept the series airing through seasons seven, eight and nine. \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" was later renewed for a tenth season which premiered on March 15, 2015. In February 2015, it was announced that the show had been renewed for four more years, along with an additional spin-off series, making it one of the longest-running reality television series in the country. In terms of the show's future, Kim Kardashian has commented that the reality series could go for an indefinite number of seasons saying that she: \"hope[s] it goes on for as long as it can.\" \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\", including its spin-off series, has become the cable network's flagship show and its most lucrative franchise. \"It has changed the face of E!\" said Lisa Berger, the network's executive producer. \"We were a place to report on celebrity; we weren't a place to break and make celebrity, which is now the whole idea of the E! brand.\" The show's success contributed significantly towards building the \"Kardashian brand\", or \"Kardashian Inc.\" as it is called by \"The Hollywood Reporter\". \"These shows are a 30-minute commercial,\" Khloé Kardashian admitted in 2011, in response to a suggestion that the television series is used to promote their retail stores and endorsement deals.\n\nOn August 3, 2017, it was announced the show's 10 year anniversary will premiere on September 24, 2017 following the show's season 14 premiere.\n\nOn August 24, 2017, it was announced the family had signed a $150 million deal with E!.\n\nThe reality series revolves around the children of Kris Jenner, and originally focused mainly on the children from her first marriage to deceased attorney Robert Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob. Kris' children Kendall and Kylie from her subsequent marriage to American athlete Caitlyn (formerly Bruce) Jenner have also been featured on the show since its beginning, along with Jenner's son Brody from another marriage, although he appeared very few times during the early seasons, mostly being called by his step-brother Rob to babysit their half-sisters Kylie and Kendall. Kourtney's boyfriend Scott Disick has also been appearing frequently on the show since the first season, as well as on the show's spin-offs. Cast members also include numerous friends and other acquaintances of the family members, most notably Malika Haqq and Jonathan Cheban who joined \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" in the second and third seasons, respectively.\n\nMost of the Kardashian sisters' significant others have appeared on the reality series. Kim's relationship with football player Reggie Bush was featured on the show when they were dating; after the breakup, Bush commented on appearing on the show saying that he never felt comfortable being followed by cameras, adding: \"I do it because it's important to [Kim].\" Rob's relationship with singer Adrienne Bailon has also been documented on the show when they were dating from 2007 to 2009; although Bailon later admitted that the decision to appear on the show, and be associated with the family, hurt her career. Kim's eventual husband Kris Humphries first appeared on the show during the premiere of the sixth season; their relationship was chronicled throughout the season and ended with the couple's wedding special \"Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event\". They eventually went through a highly publicized divorce; Kardashian's former publicist later claimed that Humphries was allegedly set up to be portrayed on the show in a negative way and that the short-lived marriage was staged for the cameras as a ploy to generate money.\n\nKhloé married basketball player Lamar Odom during a fourth-season premiere aired in 2009. He later had a major role as part of the supporting cast of the series, though he did not appear regularly during the following seasons as he was attempting to repair his marriage with Khloé. Kim's current husband Kanye West made his first appearance on \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" in July 2012 during the seventh season when he started dating Kim. However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: \"You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get.\" He also criticized the show for its cinematography and further complained about the way how the show is filmed. In the eighth season, Caitlyn Jenner's sons Brandon and Brody Jenner, as well as Brandon's wife at the time Leah, joined the cast for regular appearances.\n\nThe success of the reality series resulted in the development of several spin-off shows and other related programming. In April 2009, E! announced the first spin-off of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" entitled \"Kourtney and Khloé in Miami\", which was later renamed \"Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami\". The series followed the sisters who moved to Miami to open a new Dash boutique. Ted Harbert, president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, considered the sisters capable of handling their own standalone series. \"It's a very simple formula that we took from scripted TV and applied to a reality show. […] There are a lot of family sitcom elements to 'Kardashians,' and we think that humor and warmth will carry over to Miami,\" Harbert added. The show premiered on August 16, 2009 to very high ratings; the first episode brought in 2.7 million total viewers and then became the most-watched show on the network since \"The Anna Nicole Show\" in 2002. The spin-off was subsequently renewed for a second season which premiered on June 13, 2010, and later returned as \"Kourtney and Kim Take Miami\" for a third season on January 20, 2013. Additionally, a series of webisodes entitled \"Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord\" were released following the show, which showcased Disick as he informed viewers how to live like a \"king\".\nIn October 2010, the network announced another spin-off called \"Kourtney and Kim Take New York\" which followed the same format as its predecessor. The show debuted on January 23, 2011, and followed the sisters who opened a Dash location in New York City. The series returned for another season which premiered on November 27 the same year. In January 2011, \"Khloé & Lamar\", which featured Khloé and her husband Lamar Odom, became the third spin-off of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\". The show premiered on April 10, 2011, and lasted two seasons. In March 2014, E! announced the fourth spin-off entitled \"Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons\". The series premiered on November 2, 2014, and followed Kourtney and Khloé who relocated to the Hamptons to work on opening a new Dash pop-up store. The fifth spin-off series called \"Dash Dolls\" premiered on September 20, 2015. The reality series chronicles the daily life of the employees of the Dash boutique in Los Angeles. In June 2016, the network announced another show entitled \"Rob & Chyna\" which premiered on September 11 the same year, and follows the relationship of Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna as they prepare to welcome their first child. The show was later renewed for a second season. In July 2017, E! confirmed the series was put on hold, and not on their current schedule.\n\nThe network has also aired several television specials featuring important family events. A two-part television event called \"Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event\", showcasing the wedding between Kim and Kris Humphries, was broadcast on October 9 and 10, 2011 as part of the sixth season; the special was highly successful with a combined 10.5 million viewers. A few days after Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce) came out as a trans woman during a \"20/20\" interview with Diane Sawyer in May 2015, E! aired a two-part special on \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" entitled \"About Bruce\", in which another side of the story was told featuring family members who were not involved in the previous interview on \"20/20\". The first part of the special debuted on May 17, 2015, and attracted 2.92 million total viewers, a 40% increase from the previous episode, while the second part aired the following day with similar viewership. \"I Am Cait\", a separate documentary series, was announced immediately after the \"20/20\" interview. Jeff Olde, head of programming at E! network, said that the series is \"not at all a \"Kardashian\" spin-off\", and that \"we will not resort to spectacle,\" trying to emphasize its distinct format that is entirely different from most programming on the network, including \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\". The eight-part, one-hour docuseries debuted on July 26, 2015, on E!, and focused on how Jenner was handling the aftermath of the transition; it also attempted to deal with various LGBT-related issues. It was later cancelled after two seasons. In April 2017, it was announced E! had ordered an 8-episode spin-off \"Life of Kylie\" revolving around Kylie Jenner. It premiered on August 6, 2017.\n\n\"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" has been the subject of constant panning by critics since its inception. Brian Lowry, reviewing the show for \"Variety\", said that the network: \"widens its lens to encompass the whole irritating brood — including Kim's sisters Khloé and Kourtney, mom-manager Kris and stepdad Bruce Jenner, who now has the distinction of having two sets of useless rich kids featured in pointless reality shows.\" Ginia Bellafonte of \"The New York Times\" compared the show to reality series \"Gene Simmons Family Jewels\" and exclaimed that: \"the Kardashian show is not about an eccentric family living conventionally; it is purely about some desperate women climbing to the margins of fame, and that feels a lot creepier.\" Laura Burrows of IGN criticized the family for being too self-seeking and using the given platform only to gain more notoriety for themselves. Following the conclusion of the second season of the series, Burrows wrote: \"Those of us who watch this show […] want to believe that these whores of attention have souls and would actually do something for their fellow man and not reap the benefits of their service, but two seasons' worth of self-absorbed egocentrism speaks to the contrary.\"\n\nRoxana Hadadi, reviewing \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" for \"The Washington Post\", was extremely negative towards the reality series due to its absurdity, and commented that the show: \"firmly captures all of Kim and Co.'s dumbest instances from the series' debut from the simply self-absorbed to the downright despicable.\" Amaya Rivera, writing about the series for \"Popmatters\", noted: \"Indeed, there is something disturbing about the Kardashians' intense hunger for fame. But even worseit is downright boring to watch this family live out their tedious lives.\" John Kubicek, the senior writer of BuddyTV, reviewed the premiere of the third season of the show and discussed the reason for the family's success by saying that: \"the Kardashians' fame is a lot like Möbius strip or an M. C. Escher painting.\" Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" as a: \"Hollywood version of \"The Brady Bunch\" -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections\". Jessica Chasmar of \"The Washington Times\" said that series: \"illustrates our nation's moral, spiritual and cultural decay.\" Chasmar emphasized its negative influence and noted: \"America of 50 years ago would regard Ms. Kardashian with a mixture of disdain and pity, embarrassed by the very idea of a young lady's most private moments being broadcast for all the world to see.\"\n\nGoal Auzeen Saedi, reviewing \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" for \"Psychology Today\", emphasized the show's influence saying that: \"The Kardashians become more relatable the more famous they become.\" Saedi also questioned their decision to appear on the show and added: \"But if living life in the spotlight is so taxing and demands multiple justifications for the way your life is being lived and criticized, perhaps you can take the cameras out of your house.\" Vinnie Mancuso, writing for \"New York Observer\", criticized the show and felt: \"roughly one iota of shadenfreudic pleasure from this endeavor, but for the most part this show is the 100% drizzling poops.\" David Hinckley of the \"New York Daily News\", reviewing the tenth season, said that \"even when you think something about the Kardashians could be interesting, it's not,\" adding that the \"entertainment value [of the show] is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change.\" Amy Amatangelo of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that \"in true Kardashian fashion, they managed to make everything about them,\" after Caitlyn Jenner came out as a trans woman to her family in the \"About Bruce\" special aired as part of the tenth season. Amatangelo felt that the conversations \"seemed a little too staged, too controlled\", and noted that \"there was no attempt to educate the viewers about transgender issues.\"\n\nHowever, several critics were more positive towards the show. A number of publications welcomed the show as \"guilty pleasure\", including \"The Huffington Post\", \"The Atlantic\", and \"The Week\". Tim Stack, writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\", described the reality series as: \"my favorite little slice of reality TV spongecake.\" Lauren Le Vine of Refinery29 appreciated the success of the family which \"achieved the American dream of making something out of nothing,\" using the given platform. Libby Hill of \"The A.V. Club\" also acknowledged the show's success and said: \"\"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" gives us real, joyous, ugly, unsavory, hilarious life, with all the polished sitcom trappings. And though the latter may have launched a multimedia empire, the former has made it last\". Maura Kelly of \"The Guardian\" evaluated the aftermath of the failed wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, which was documented on \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" and subsequently caused public outrage, including an online protest petition to cancel the show. \"Since Kim doesn't exactly seem to be an exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible that she really believed she and Humphries would live happily ever after,\" Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a publicity stunt. \"But more likely, she and E! are laughing all the way to the bank 10.5 million viewers tuned into \"Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event\", after all,\" Kelly summarized the controversy. Josh Duboff, writing for \"Vanity Fair\", commented on the show's long run and said that \"it is near impossible to argue that their continued relevance, 10 years later, is anything other than awe-inspiring and remarkable\".\n\n\"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" has been a ratings success for E! in its first month it became the highest-rated series aired on Sunday nights for adults 1834 and was seen by 1.3 million total viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. Lisa Berger, executive vice president of original programming and series development for E!, said: \"The buzz surrounding the series is huge, and viewers have clearly fallen for the Kardashians. […] Seacrest and Bunim-Murray's unique ability to capture this family's one-of-a-kind dynamics and hilarious antics has made the series a fantastic addition to our prime-time lineup.\" The second season continued the success and was viewed by 1.6 million viewers on average, which led to a third season renewal. The two-hour fourth-season premiere, which aired on November 8, 2009, and featured the wedding ceremony of Khloé and Lamar Odom, brought in then-record ratings with 3.2 million viewers. The subsequent season debuted with nearly 4.7 million total viewers, which ranked as the highest-rated season premiere of the show, as of August 2015. It was also the second highest-rated episode of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\", second only to the previous season's record-breaking finale with 4.8 million viewers.\n\nThe seventh-season premiere of the series, which aired on May 20, 2012 in its earlier timeslot, continued to deliver high ratings attracting almost three million total viewers which exceeded the premiere of the previous season by 16%. Kim Kardashian has explained the success of the show by saying that people tune in to watch the series because they can relate themselves to the members of the family; in an interview with the \"V\" magazine she said: \"You can see that soap operas aren't on the air as much anymore. I think reality shows are taking over that genre, but I think the draw to our show is that we are relatable.\" The eighth season debuted to 3 million viewers, up 6% from the previous season, while the subsequent ninth season's premiere was down by 20%. The ninth season averaged 3.3 million total viewers and almost 2.2 million in the 1849 years adult demographic, the most sought after by advertisers. It was the highest rated cable show in its timeslot. The series finished as the most-social ad-supported cable program and, as of March 2015, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" is the most-watched show on E! network. The first episode of the tenth season averaged 2.5 million viewers, slightly less than the premiere of the ninth season. In 2016, a \"New York Times\" study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" \"tends to most popular in areas with large Hispanic populations, particularly in the Southwest\".\n\nDespite negative reviews from critics, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" has been nominated for, and won, several television awards. The reality series has received nominations for a Teen Choice Award in the Choice TV: Celebrity Reality Show category nine consecutive times between 2008 and 2016, winning the award in 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2016. The show also won a People's Choice Award as Favorite TV Guilty Pleasure in 2011. The Kardashian sisters have been nominated as part of the cast for five awards, winning four times; Kim Kardashian has been nominated for three awards winning one in 2012. In 2010, Kris and Caitlyn Jenner received a Teen Choice Award nomination in a one-time Choice TV: Parental Unit category.\n\n\"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" premiered on October 14, 2007 in the United States on the E! cable network at 10:30/9:30 pm ET/PT.

{"id": "218723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=218723", "title": "Orion Pictures", "text": "Orion Pictures\n\nOrion Pictures Corporation is an American motion picture producer and distributor that produced and released films from 1978 until 1999 and was also involved in television production and syndication throughout the 1980s until the early 1990s. It was formed in 1978 as a joint venture between Warner Bros. and three former top-level executives of United Artists. Although it was never a large motion picture producer, Orion achieved a comparatively high reputation for Hollywood quality. Woody Allen, James Cameron, Jonathan Demme, Oliver Stone, and several other prominent directors worked with Orion during its most successful years from 1978 to 1992. Of the films distributed by Orion, four won Academy Awards for Best Picture: \"Amadeus\" (1984), \"Platoon\" (1986), \"Dances with Wolves\" (1990), and \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991). Two other Orion films, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986) and \"Mississippi Burning\" (1988), were nominated for that same category.\n\nIn 2013, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer revived the Orion name for television; a year later, Orion Pictures was relaunched by the studio.\n\nIn January 1978, three executives of Transamerica (TA)-owned studio United Artists (UA) – Arthur B. Krim (chairman), Eric Pleskow (president and chief executive officer), and Robert S. Benjamin (chairman of the finance committee) - quit their jobs. Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951, and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967, and within a decade a rift formed between Krim and TA chairman Jack Beckett regarding the studio's operations. Krim suggested spinning off United Artists into a separate company, which was rejected by Beckett.\n\nThe last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica's offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened when \"Fortune\" magazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA, in which Beckett had stated that if the executives disliked the parent company's treatment of them, they should resign. Krim, Benjamin, and Pleskow quit United Artists on January 13, 1978, followed by the exits of senior vice presidents William Bernstein and Mike Medavoy three days later. The week following the resignations, according to the website \"Reference for Business\", \"63 important Hollywood figures took out an advertisement in a trade paper warning UA that it had made a fatal mistake in letting the five men leave. The 'fatal mistake' came true following the box office disaster of \"Heaven's Gate\"\" which led to Transamerica selling UA to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nIn February 1978, the five men forged a deal with Warner Bros. The executives formed Orion Pictures Company, named after the constellation, which they claimed had five main stars (it actually has seven/eight). The new company intended only to finance projects, giving the filmmakers complete creative autonomy; this ideal was implemented with great success at United Artists. Orion held a $100 million line of credit, and its films would be distributed by the Warner Bros. studio. Orion, however, was contractually given free rein over distribution and advertising, as well as the number and type of films the executives chose to invest in.\n\nIn late March 1978, Orion signed its first contract; a two-picture deal with John Travolta's production company. Contracts with actress and director Barbra Streisand; actors James Caan, Jane Fonda, Peter Sellers, Jon Voight, and Burt Reynolds; directors Francis Ford Coppola and Blake Edwards; writer/director John Milius; singer Peter Frampton; and producer Ray Stark soon materialized. Orion also developed a co-financing and distribution deal with EMI Films. In its first year, Orion had 15 films into productions plus were in production, and had a dozen more actors, directors and producers line up to sign up with Orion.\n\nIn 1979, Benjamin died. Orion's first film, \"A Little Romance\", was released in April that year. That year, Orion released Blake Edwards' \"10\", which became a big critical and commercial success; the first for Edwards in over a decade (aside from installments of \"The Pink Panther\" franchise). Other films released in that period included \"Caddyshack\"; \"The Great Santini\", a critically praised but underpromoted adaptation of a Pat Conroy novel; and \"Promises in the Dark\". Out of the 23 films Orion released between April 1979 and December 1981, only a third of them made a profit. Orion executives were conflicted over financing big-budgeted films and passed on \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" for that reason.\n\nBy early 1982, Orion had severed its distribution ties with Warner. As part of the deal, the rights to Orion's films made up to that point were sold to Warner. Orion was now looking to have its own distribution network by acquiring another company with such capabilities. The four partners looked into Allied Artists and Embassy Pictures before settling on Filmways. Orion subsequently purchased Filmways and reorganized the flailing company. New employees were hired and all of Filmways' non-entertainment assets (Grosset & Dunlap and Broadcast Electronics) were sold off. On August 31, 1982, Filmways was renamed as Orion Pictures Corporation.\n\nAnother result of the merger was that Orion entered television production. Orion's biggest TV hit was \"Cagney & Lacey\", which lasted seven seasons on CBS. In 1983, Orion Pictures introduced art-house division Orion Classics with executives who had previously run United Artists Classics.\n\nAccording to \"Reference for Business\": \"Of the first 18 movies the company had released as Orion Pictures Corporation, ten had been profitable, five had broken even, and three had losses of less than $2 million.\" One such film, Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Cotton Club\", was mired in legal troubles and Orion lost $3 million of its investment. '\"We've had some singles and doubles [but haven't] had any home runs,\" lamented Krim. In September 1984, Orion distributed \"Amadeus\", which garnered many accolades, winning eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n\nFor Orion, 1985 was a dismal year. All but two films, \"Desperately Seeking Susan\" and \"Code of Silence\", made less than $10 million in the United States box office, including an unsuccessful attempt at a James Bond-type franchise, \"\". Orion's haphazard distribution channels and unsuccessful advertising campaigns made it impossible to achieve a hit. Another factor was that Orion was about to venture into the video business and stopped selling off home use rights to its films. Furthermore, production of the Rodney Dangerfield comedy \"Back to School\" was put on hold when a co-producer died, taking the film off of its Christmas 1985 release slate.\n\nIn January 1986, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, producers of the \"Rambo\" films (the first film, \"First Blood\", was distributed by Orion) attempted to buy $55 million worth of the studio's stock through the duo's company, Anabasis. Had they succeeded, Kassar and Vajna would have controlled the board and laid off every executive save for Krim. Warburg Pincus subsequently limited its 20% stake in Orion to 5%; the remaining stocks were acquired by Viacom International. Viacom hoped to use Orion's product for its pay-TV channel Showtime. Orion expanded into home video distribution with the formation of Orion Home Entertainment Corporation.\n\nOn May 22, 1986, Metromedia, a television and communications company controlled by billionaire (and a friend of Krim's) John Kluge, which had just divested of its television station group to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation (which would form what is now the Fox network), purchased a 6.5% stake in Orion. Kluge's investment in the company came at the right time- \"Back to School\" was a success and ultimately earned $90 million at the box office. By March 1987, the studio's fortunes increased dramatically with a succession of critical and commercial hits, including \"Platoon\" (which ultimately won a Best Picture Oscar), Woody Allen's \"Hannah and Her Sisters\", and the sports film \"Hoosiers\". Orion's 1986 offerings totaled 18 Academy Award nominations, more than any other studio. In 1987, Orion achieved further success with \"RoboCop\", and \"No Way Out\". By this time, Orion's television division had expanded into the lucrative syndicated game show market under the name \"Century Towers Productions\", in reference to Orion's street address at the time. It produced revivals of format inherited from Heatter-Quigley Productions after the Filmways merger (as Filmways had previously acquired HQ in the late 1960s); this included \"The New Hollywood Squares\", which ran from 1986 to 1989, and a revival of \"High Rollers\" which aired in the 1987-88 season.\n\nIn January 1987, Kluge faced big competition with the arrival of Sumner Redstone. His theater chain, National Amusements, purchased 6.42 percent of the company's stock. National Amusements later acquired Viacom, increasing their Orion stake at 21%, then 26%. Soon Kluge started buying more Orion stock, leading to him and Redstone battling it out to take over the company. Kluge ultimately succeeded when Metromedia took over approximately 67% of Orion on May 20, 1988, effectively giving him control of the studio. One analyst commented on the takeover to the \"Wall Street Journal\": \"This amount is probably so small to Kluge it doesn't matter. He probably burns that up in a weekend.\"\n\nIn 1989, Orion suffered from a disastrous slate of films, placing themselves dead last among the major Hollywood studios in terms of box office revenue. Among its biggest flops that year were \"Great Balls of Fire!\", the biography of Jerry Lee Lewis starring Dennis Quaid and Winona Ryder; \"She-Devil\", a dark comedy starring Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr; and Miloš Forman's adaptation of \"Les Liaisons dangereuses\", \"Valmont\", which competed with \"Dangerous Liaisons\", also based on the same source material. Test screenings of the \"Weird Al\" Yankovic comedy \"UHF\" were so strong that Orion had high expectations for it. It flopped at first, but it has since attained a strong cult following.\n\nIn February 1990, Orion signed a deal with Columbia Pictures Entertainment in which the much larger studio would pay Orion $175 million to distribute Orion's movies and television programs overseas. Orion had previously licensed its films to individual distributors territory by territory. That same month, Mike Medavoy left Orion and became head of Tri-Star Pictures.\n\n1990 was just as dismal for Orion as the year prior, with such failures as \"The Hot Spot\" and \"State of Grace\". The only bright spot that year was Kevin Costner's western epic \"Dances with Wolves\". It won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and grossed $400 million worldwide. A few months later, Orion garnered another winner with \"The Silence of the Lambs\", but these two films could not make up for years of losses. Only Kluge's continued infusions of cash were enough to keep the company afloat, but soon he had enough.\n\nAfter failing to sell Orion to businessman (and former 20th Century Fox owner) Marvin Davis (Sony, which had recently purchased Columbia Pictures was also interested), Kluge took drastic steps. First, Orion shut down production. Second, Kluge ordered the sale of several projects, such as \"The Addams Family\" (which went to Paramount, though the international rights to the film were retained by Orion), in order to accumulate much-needed cash. Finally, in the spring of 1991, Kluge's people took over the company, leading to the departure of Arthur Krim. Orion's financial problems were so severe, that at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards in March 1991, host Billy Crystal made reference to the studio's debt in his opening monologue, joking that \"\"Reversal of Fortune\" [is] about a woman in a coma, \"Awakenings\" [is] about a man in a coma; and \"Dances with Wolves\" [was] released by Orion, a studio in a coma.\"\n\nIt was during this time that ABC stepped in to co-finance and assume production over many of Orion TV's shows it had in production, such as \"American Detective\" and \"Equal Justice\".\n\nOn November 25, 1991, Orion sold its \"Hollywood Squares\" format rights to King World Productions after Orion closed down its television division. On December 11, 1991, Orion filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nIn December 1991, Orion was in talks with New Line Cinema, a successful independent film company, to acquire the bankrupt studio. By the following April, Orion and New Line Cinema cancelled their plans on the issue of price. Republic Pictures and the then-new Savoy Pictures also attempted to buy Orion, but no deal materialized.\n\nAt the Academy Awards ceremony, broadcast on March 30, 1992, Crystal yet made another reference to Orion, this time about its demise: \n\n\"The Silence of the Lambs\" swept all five major Academy Awards; however, a majority of key executives, as well as the talent they had deals with, had left the studio. Hollywood observers had doubts that Orion would be resurrected to its former glory.\n\nOn November 5, 1992, Orion reemerged from bankruptcy. Its reorganization plan would allow for Orion to continue producing and releasing films, but financing for the features would be provided by outside sources, with the studio purchasing the distribution rights to them after their completion.\n\nOrion's bankruptcy also delayed the release of many films the studio had produced or acquired, among them: \"Love Field\" (1992), \"RoboCop 3\" (1993), \"The Dark Half\" (1993), \"Blue Sky\" (1994), \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" (1994), \"Clifford\" (1994), \"The Favor\" (1994), and \"There Goes My Baby\" (1994). Orion started releasing these films after their reorganization. \"Blue Sky\" won star Jessica Lange an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1995.\n\nIn November 1995, Orion and three other companies controlled by Kluge were merged to form the Metromedia International Group. Few of the films released during the four years after bankruptcy protection were successful either critically or commercially.\n\nIn 1996, Metromedia acquired production company Motion Picture Corporation of America, and installed its heads, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler, as co-presidents of Orion. Both received a six picture put picture distribution deal as a part of their contracts.\n\nIn the years ahead, Orion produced very few films, and primarily released films from other producers, including LIVE Entertainment. Orion Classics, minus its founders (who had moved to Sony Pictures Entertainment and founded Sony Pictures Classics), continued to acquire popular art-house films, such as \"Boxing Helena\" (1993), before Metromedia merged the subsidiary with Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment in 1996.\n\nIn July 1997, Metromedia shareholders approved the sale of Orion (as well as Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment and Motion Picture Corporation of America) to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. This led to the withdrawal of 85 employees, including Krevoy and Stabler, while 111 other employees were to be laid off within nine months, leaving 25 of them to work at MGM. Orion also brought with it, a two thousand film library, ten completed movies and five direct-to-video features for future release and the Krevoy and Stabler movie put picture distribution deal. Krevoy and Stabler retained the right to the Motion Picture Corporation of America name and their three top movies. Metromedia retained Goldwyn Entertainment's Landmark Theatre Group. \"One Man's Hero\" (1999) was the last film released by Orion for 15 years.\n\nMGM kept Orion intact as a corporation thus to avoid its Warner Bros. video distribution agreement and began distributing Orion Pictures films under the Orion Home Video label. MGM acquired the 2/3 of pre-1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment library from Seagram in 1999 for $250 million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 video distribution agreement with Warner. In March 1999, MGM bought out its distribution contract with Warner Bros. for $225 million, effectively ending the distribution problem.\n\nIn 2013, MGM revived the Orion Television brand (after Orion's original TV unit was shut down during its bankruptcy era in the early 1990s) as Orion TV Productions with a new syndicated series, \"Paternity Court\".\n\nThe Orion Pictures name, also as Orion Releasing, was extended in fourth quarter 2014 for smaller multi-platform video on demand and limited theatrical distribution. Its name was first seen again on September 10, 2014 in front of the trailer for \"The Town That Dreaded Sundown\" that was released in October. The label's first release was the Brazilian film \"Vestido pra Casar\".\n\nIn September 2015, Entertainment One Films relaunched the Momentum Pictures banner with an announced deal with Orion Pictures to co-acquire and co-distribute films in the United States and Canada, and selected foreign markets, such as the United Kingdom (Momentum's country of origin). The initial films under the deal were \"The Wannabe\", \"Fort Tilden\" and \"Balls Out\". Other films released by Orion Pictures and Momentum Pictures include \"Pocket Listing\" and \"Diablo\".\n\nStarting in September 2016 with \"Burn Country\", Orion Pictures and Samuel Goldwyn Films paired in acquiring several films.\n\nIn 2017, Orion TV added another court series, \"Couples Court\", to its syndicated line up. The show is presided over by a husband wife team and deals with marital issues primarily cheating.\n\nOn September 6, 2017, MGM officially revitalized the Orion Pictures brand as a standalone, US theatrical marketing and distribution arm with the hiring of John Hegeman, who had come from Blumhouse Tilt (distributor of Orion's \"The Town That Dreaded Sundown\" and \"The Belko Experiment\") and incidentally got his start working at the old Orion in the 1980s. Hegeman will serve as president of the expanded label and report to Jonathan Glickman, president of MGM's motion picture group. Under his leadership, the \"new\" Orion will produce, market and distribute four to six modestly budgeted films a year across genres and platforms, both wide and limited releases for targeted audiences, and its first release, the young adult romance drama \"Every Day\", was released in February 23, 2018.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced the Orion Classics would be revived as a multiplatform distribution label, with 8 to 10 films being released per year.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, Orion's output included Woody Allen films, Hollywood blockbusters such as the first \"Terminator\" and the \"RoboCop\" films, comedies such as \"Throw Momma from the Train\", \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\", \"Something Wild\", \"UHF\", and the \"Bill & Ted\" films, and Best Picture Academy Award winners \"Amadeus\", \"Platoon\", \"Dances with Wolves\", and \"The Silence of the Lambs\".\n\nFollowing is a list of the major Academy Awards (Picture, Director, two Screenplay and four Acting awards) for which Orion films were nominated.\n\nAlmost all of Orion's post-1982 releases, as well as most of the AIP and Filmways backlogs and all of the television output originally produced and distributed by Orion Television, now bear the MGM name. However, in most cases, the 1980s Orion logo has been retained or added, in the case of the Filmways and AIP libraries.\n\nMost ancillary rights to Orion's back catalog from the 1978–1982 joint venture period remain with Warner Bros., including such movies as \"10\" (1979), \"Caddyshack\" (1980), \"Arthur\" (1981), \"Excalibur\" (1981), and \"Prince of the City\" (1981). Some post-1982 films originally released by Orion — \"Lionheart\" (1987), \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" (1988), and \"Amadeus\" (1984) (the latter two being Saul Zaentz productions) — are currently distributed by Warner Bros. as well. HBO also owns video distribution rights to \"Three Amigos\" (1986), which co-produced the film and owns pay-TV rights. However, MGM owns all other rights and the film's copyright. \"The Wanderers\" is owned by the film's producers; however, the copyright is held by MGM/Orion.\n\nWoody Allen's films \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" (1982) and \"Zelig\" (1983) are the only Orion films from the original joint venture period now owned by MGM. Orion releases produced by the Hemdale Film Corporation and Nelson Entertainment are included in MGM's library as well, and are incorporated into the Orion library. MGM via Polygram Entertainment did not acquire the Hemdale films, (which include \"The Terminator\", \"Hoosiers\", and \"Platoon\") or the Nelson films (including the \"Bill & Ted\" films), until MGM via Polygram Entertainment bought the pre-1996 library of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, which included both companies' libraries, although the television and digital rights to certain Nelson films are now held by Paramount Television, with television syndication handled on behalf of Paramount Television by Trifecta Entertainment & Media.\n\nMany of the film and television holdings of The Samuel Goldwyn Company have now also been incorporated into the Orion library (with ownership currently held by MGM), and the copyright on some of this material is held by Orion, except \"The New Adventures of Flipper\" now carries the MGM Television Entertainment copyright.\n\nMGM still holds distribution rights to the 1980s revival of \"Hollywood Squares\" and \"High Rollers\" the company produced, as well as the remnants of the Heatter-Quigley library that was not erased, including all remaining episodes of the original \"Squares\"; they do not own the rights to the format, which is currently owned by CBS Television Distribution, successor-in-interest to King World, who purchased the format rights in 1991 and produced another syndicated revival from 1998 to 2004.\n\nOrion distributed the first Rambo film, \"First Blood\" (1982). That film, like the rest of the \"Rambo\" franchise, is now owned by StudioCanal as a result of purchasing the library of its co-distributor, Carolco Pictures.\n\n"}

{"id": "20812322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20812322", "title": "Paul David Wilson", "text": "Paul David Wilson\n\nPaul David Wilson (born August 30, 1952) is a songwriter, composer, conductor, and music producer. Most of his professional life has been devoted to music, including composing for radio and TV commercials. He became the president of a start-up record label begun by Frank Thomas, who was then the starring player on the Chicago White Sox baseball team. Wilson suffered a massive and debilitating stroke when he was 46 years old. Due to the terribly limiting effects of aphasia, a common but complicated and severe post-stroke condition, he was for a number of years unable to communicate without great difficulty. His fight back to full functioning has been a decade-long challenge that, although largely successful, in many ways still continues.\n\nPaul David Wilson was born in Chicago, Illinois. He was third son to father, Herbert, a classical tenor vocalist and choir director who taught elementary school and retired after becoming a vice-principal of the school. Paul's mother, Odessa, was a child prodigy who grew to become a concert pianist and choir director. She was accomplished in a variety of music genres, but due to her commitment to God, only performed certain styles of music. Paul's early lessons on piano came from his mother, and he grew up absorbing the classical and gospel music of the choirs and vocal ensembles his parents directed.\n\nWhile still of pre-school age, Paul began composing simple songs and by the time he began primary school had learned to musically notate the songs he composed. At age 12, Paul began organizing \"street corner\" vocal ensembles to perform his songs at parties and selected school functions. At 13, he discovered the flute and it soon became his major instrument. Paul attended James H. Bowen High School in Chicago. In Paul's fourth year of high school, a friend, Arlene Johnson, persuaded him to run for class president. He was elected Senior Class President of Bowen in 1970.\n\nHe remembers the day when he was a still-young teenager and \"my mother dragged me to a seminar on how to create commercial jingles.\" The presenters were Dick Marx, whose young son would later become a pop music star known as Richard Marx, who was then Chicago's most prominent master of music for Radio and TV commercials, and Dr. Thomas Fabish, the concert master of DePaul University’s music department. The presentation involved a big band, top-notch singers and a film. Even as he listened, Paul was thinking, \"I could do that.\"\n\nInspired by Primous Fountain III, a young composer at DePaul University, Paul enrolled and majored in music composition and theory. He studied music composition with Dr. Leon Stein, Dr. Phil Winsor and Darlene Cowles, while taking flute with Philip Seeburg and Joseph Kainz. In 1973, he was one of 20 music students from around the U.S. selected by Ron Logan of Walt Disney Entertainment to participate in a professional \"work experience.\" Paul remembers it as one of the major highlights of his college career. He wrote at that time in August 1973:\n\nDuring his study at DePaul, he founded, performed in, and composed for many ensembles and often organized concerts and productions that featured works by him and others. In his senior year, Paul was honored by inclusion in \"Who's Who Among Students in American Universities & Colleges\" and graduated in 1975 with a B.A. in music composition and theory.\n\nIn May 1974, while a senior at DePaul, he landed part-time employment at \"Star Point 7,\" a music production company founded by Chuck Colbert, a producer/musician with a jazz-rock band, American Breed (\"Bend Me, Shape Me\"). Paul started this \"job\" as an unpaid go-fer, answering phones and doing basic clerical chores. After two months, Paul was eager for a chance to show what he could contribute and saw the situation as an opportunity. \"Chuck and his writing partner had parted ways and he needed someone to help finish a project. I was around and available and had the skills. I had to ask him, what are you waiting for?\" Once Paul had called attention to his talents, Colbert began using him as a composer and arranger.\n\nA short time later, in the Summer of 1974, Paul met a young musician who was just completing his military service, Danny Leake. At the time, Danny was a talented songwriter and electric guitar player, but would later become one of America's foremost recording studio engineers and one of Paul's closest and most frequent collaborators.\n\nIn the Fall of 1975, Danny played a significant role in Paul's life by introducing him to Ian Levine, a producer and songwriter, who was a celebrated member of the European black music fan base known as the Northern Soul scene. In 1975, while working with Ian, Paul composed, arranged and produced for Dance, R&B and Northern Soul recording artists, in the course of which he traveled in the U.S. and England. One of the Levine's artists, Evelyn Thomas, scored a chart hit with her first single, reaching the UK Top 30 in 1976 with the single \"Weak Spot,\" and \"which was (co-written and) arrangement by Paul.\" As the writer, Neil Rushton, wrote in a review which appeared in Black Echoes, \"Paul put the incredible zinging, scurrying strings in \"Your Magic Put A Spell In Me\" performed by [L.J Johnson Ian Levine] for Ian Levine productions and also served as the songwriter and arranger for the \"1976 Disco classic, originally sung by James Wells, called \"Baby I'm Still The Same Man.\"\n\nDespite the success and trans-Atlantic travel he was experiencing, Paul still lived at home with his mother and father. One day in early 1976, while diligently making \"cold calls\" from his parents’ basement in hopes of drumming up some fresh music opportunities, Paul found himself talking to Jerry Butler, a fellow Chicagoan who was already well known in American soul music. Butler had (with Curtis Mayfield) been one of the original founding members of The Impressions and then established a long later career as a celebrated solo artist. That lucky phone call not only gave Paul a chance to meet Butler, but soon led to the opportunity to work with him on a few projects, including three albums \"Suite For The Single Girl\", \"It All Comes Out In My Song\" (title song) and Thelma (Houston) & Jerry for the Motown label. Subsequently, Paul and Butler they produce an album on Dee Dee Sharp-Gample with Philadelphia International. \"Billboard\" said, \"writer/co-producer Paul Wilson’s \"Invitation\" is a regal, touching trumph that alone would have made for worthwhile album.\" In 1981 with \"Breaking and Entering\" / \"Easy Money,\" from Sharp-Gamble's album \"Dee Dee\", Paul's production spent four weeks at number one on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and Dance Chart Billboard.\n\nAfter two years of working with Chuck Colbert and learning the myriad business-related details one must to be successful in commercial music production, in 1976, at age 24, Paul founded Herschel Commercial, Inc (\"I just named it Hershel Commercial, Inc. because it rhymed, he notes) with Maurice Earl, Arlene Johnson and, later, Bruce Montgomery. His first client was Chicago-based Burrell Communications Group, LLC, founded by Tom Burrell. Although Anna Morris, the creative director of Burrell, thought Paul might benefit from a little more \"seasoning\" before going out on his own, he proclaimed with great certainty, \"Look, I’m ready!\" Now, as impressed with his confidence as with his talents, Morris awarded him a package of several arranging spots to produce for Coca-Cola. The tracks featured Kitty Heywood, a sweet-voiced soul singer who had already performed on a number of albums as well as commercials. Once produced, the spots were enthusiastically received, both at the ad agency and at the client. Paul was soon creating and producing a long list of memorable and award-winning spots for Burrell and many other ad agencies, often working with such established artists as: Phyllis Hyman, Lena Horne, Anita Baker, Midnight Star, Walter Jackson, The Dells, Peabo Bryson, Ada Dyer Vickie Winans, Tramaine Hawkins, The Bar-Kays, Valerie Simpson, Joshie Jo Armstead, Millie Jackson and Rufus Thomas.\n\nAlso of note is the score Paul composed for a television film \"Happy Birthday, Martin\" sung by Joshie Jo Armstead, which is on permanent display at the King Center in Atlanta.\n\nIn 1977, a chance meeting at a barbershop brought Paul to the attention of Don Richards, a young vice-president and account executive at Leo Burnett Worldwide, Chicago's largest and most celebrated advertising agency. Richards had been hired to facilitate Burnett's efforts to identify promising new African American staffers and suppliers, so he was ready to talk business even on a weekend trip to his barber. On hearing the young composer's story, Richards handed him a card, saying, \"Call me… next week.\" Paul made sure he called Richards. That meeting was most fortunate for Paul and for Herschel. It set them on the path to success and helped establish their reputation with even the biggest and best clients, which included such major brand names as Kraft, Quaker Oats, Campbell Soup Company, United Airlines, Kellogg Company, Coca-Cola, Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company, Anheuser Busch, Busch Entertainment, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, Mars Incorporated, Alberto-Culver and Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Productions (Oprah Winfrey). In 1980, People magazine, they featured an article on Paul. The title was \"Lookout. A Guide To The Up And Coming.\" \n\nPaul says, \"To be successful, you have to be a chameleon. You're paid to do a job, not to be a conscience.\" Paul wrote and composed many memorable TV and Radio music spots during the commercial phase of his career. Some of the many highlights include; \"I Wanna Pop, I Wanna Shasta\" for Shasta Beverages, \"Sweet Talker, Betty Crocker\" for Betty Crocker, \"Mmm, Ahh, Ohh, Pop ‘N Fresh Dough\" for Pillsbury. \"Until 1981, I was known for lavish, heartwarming arrangements,\" says Wilson, who is a classically trained flutist with degrees in composition and orchestration. \"Then I had a hit with \"I Wanna Pop! I Wanna Shasta!\" and suddenly I was the rock ‘n’ roll guy, the king of the synthesizers.\"\nPaul won a prestigious CLIO award for his arranging work on the McDonald's commercial \"Makin’ Music.\"\n\nIn 1985, Paul scored a true \"crossover hit\" when a song he’d created for Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau and composed both lyrics and music featuring Lee Montgomery \"Calling Me Home, Chicago,\" a song written for a $10 million state tourism campaign, became so instantly popular that it was released as a single and sold through area record stores. Jan Zechman of Jan Zechman Associates said, \"For Chicago Tourism, our advertising agency asked six local composers to create a musical centerpiece for our campaign. We expected the competition to be fierce. It was not. One airing of Paul's musical vision was enough to win him the job, and to help us create one of the most memorable and successful tourism campaigns in Chicago history. I believe in the power of words, but the power of Paul's music, his notes, proved mightier than any pen on this day.\" That song is widely regarded even today as one of the true \"classic\" songs of Chicago.\n\nRuth L. Ratny, the owner of the magazine \"Screen\" and editor, she wrote, \"Among the most memorable for the Illinois Department of Tourism, are the unforgettable \"Calling Me Home, Chicago.\" State tourism director Lynda Simon says isn’t surprised that Wilson was able to write words and that went a long way towards popularizing the agency's first major television campaign. \"He’s a very talented and creative person,\" says Simon, \"and he’s a joy to work with.\" \n\nIn 1987, because of his desire to re-enter the record business, Paul (with attorney Linda Mensch) discovered and produced a new artist, \"Nikki.\" Eventually signed to Geffen Records, the debut album entitled \"Nikki\" was released in the summer of 1989. One song, \"Notice Me\" was a hit, reaching #21 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #11 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, bringing Paul honors from BMI as writer and publisher of one of the most performed songs of the year.\n\nIn early 1989, Paul was called on by noted choral conductor Nathan Carter to orchestrate Robert Ray's \"Gospel Mass\" for a joint performance of the Morgan State University Choir and the Detroit Symphony. Also in 1989, Paul was appointed conductor/artistic director for a concert series entitled \"Classic Black\" (Executive Produced by Valarie Norman). The first concert was given at Chicago's Orchestra Hall in April 1990.\n\nPaul wrote:\n\nIn 1997, Wilson accepted an offer from Frank Thomas, \"The Big Hurt\" the star player and home run hitter of the Chicago White Sox, to serve as President of Un-D-Nyable Entertainment, an independent record label. Paul agreed to run the label in partnership with Thomas.\n\nTheir initial release was a CD single entitled \"3-5, The White Sox Got’em Open Up Wide,\" with Frank Thomas featuring D. Stoy. Paul discovered and signed Dejah Gomez, a precociously talented 14-year-old singer and songwriter, and hired Cleo Powell, who had an established reputation locally for recognizing and nurturing talent, as the label's A&R Director.\n\nIn 1998, Wilson hired Jun Mhoon, accomplished both as a musician and an executive at A&M Records, as Executive V.P. General Manager and Maurice White, formerly with Columbia Records, as Promotion Director and Jon Smith, Studio Manager. He also signed Entourage (James \"Slique\" Adams, Floyd Massey, Eric Wade and Irone Guyton, a R&B singing group), rapper Ant-Dub and STRONG, an R&B group that was a family of five brothers. He then secured the services of songwriters/producers, Jack & Earl and George Claiborne. He soon formed an alliance with the music distributors, Navarro.\n\nIn late 1998, Wilson produced the debut CD for Dejah Gomez (\"Dejah\") and Entourage (\"The Fall Backs of a Playa\") and matching videos for the CD songs and a CD single title \"I Can’t Hide\" featuring STRONG. In December, a single \"When,\" by Entourage, they charted on Billboard. Soon, both Dejah Gomez and Entourage were starting to \"take off,\" but, in January 1999, just as the action and excitement was building for his young record company, Paul Wilson suffered a stroke.\n\nOn January 2, 1999, the stroke left the active and energetic 46-year-old composer, producer and businessman suddenly and seriously disabled (CT). The doctors revealed that an ischemic CVA of left MCA with hemorrhagic transformation. Paul was told he’d have to accept lasting and severe restrictions on his ability to verbally communicate, due to the post-stroke condition known as Aphasia.\n\nAphasia is the inability to speak, read, write or understand speech. Wilson was hospitalized at West Suburban Hospital Medical Center in Oak Park and Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Subsequently, he went through rehabilitation at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and Willowbrook.\n\nPaul wrote:\n\nIn need of a restful setting for his recuperation, Paul and his wife, Terry, relocated to Maui in Hawaii where they lived for five years. Paul eventually found and studied with Dr. Walter Tokishi, a speech therapist, but the scarcity of expert medical support to help him overcome the limitations imposed by his aphasia was still a drawback of living on Maui. In 2005, he returned to Chicago, where he began an intensive rehabilitation regimen, fiercely determined to resume his musical career.\n\nPaul has six brothers. They are: James Warren (classical/gospel organ, piano), Herbert Liston (Acoustic/electric bass), John Oland (vocalist), Mark Andrew, Steward Franklin\n(B-3, piano). One brother, Mark, died when he was an infant do to heart complication.\n\nPaul has been married and divorced two times and has one stepchild:\n\n\nHe has been a Chicago Chapter Governor and National Trustee of The Recording Academy (NARAS) and active on its Education, Finance, Restructuring and Long Range Planning Committee. In the mid-1990s, he was Chicago Chapter President of The Recording Academy and later served as a trustee of the Winans Academy of Performing Arts.\n\n\nPaul performed with the band \"The Nightclub Band\" on the film, \"A Family Thing\" (Robert Duvall, James Earl Jones) which also featured the song \"Family Thing Blues\" on the soundtrack. A film, \"Signs,\" was used with Paul's music jingle, \"I Wanna Pop, I Wanna Shasta.\" His song titled, \"Invitation\" perform by Ada Dyer, was \"sample\" and then used another song entitled \"Brown Sugar (fine)\", with the film \"Brown Sugar\", which performed by Mos Def and produced by Kanye West. (The film's credits of \"Brown Sugar (fine)\" was incorrect)\n\n"}
{"id": "23728089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23728089", "title": "Public affairs industry", "text": "Public affairs industry\n\nPublic affairs generally refer to the building and development of relations between an organization and politicians, governments and other decision-makers.\n\nThe industry has developed over recent years and is normally considered a branch or sub-discipline of public relations (PR). Given the broad nature of public affairs, what exactly the industry encapsulates remains a point of discussion. While often equated with lobbying, this is usually only a small part of what a public affairs practitioner might do. Other typical functions include research, strategy planning and providing advice. \n\nIt is difficult to determine the size of the public affairs industry in the United Kingdom. Studies suggest the industry is becoming more professionalized, and that it is more widespread than often assumed. The Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR), which is the UK's professional body for public relations including public affairs, estimates there are around 48,000 people involved in PR, of which 30% are involved in public affairs. This research is limited as it only measures specific job titles and those who declare themselves to be working in PR. There are large numbers of professionals providing public affairs services while working under different job titles across a wide variety of sectors. The job titles of public affairs practitioners may vary, depending on the focus of their role, but may include, \"public affairs\", \"external affairs/relations\", \"corporate communications\", \"government/parliamentary affairs\" and \"policy\". \n\nOrganizations who make use of public affairs are typically large companies, charities, trade unions, membership organizations and interest groups. They will either have staff working directly for them or employ a firm of public affairs consultants. Very often public affairs staff will work with their non-PR colleagues who are experts in a given field. \n\nIt has been argued that professional lobbying goes against democracy as it allows big business to buy power and influence with well funded campaigns giving them an unfair advantage. Steps are being taken in several countries to attempt to increase levels of regulation and transparency in the public affairs industry. Several countries have introduced a mandatory register for lobbyists. The European Union has been working with a voluntary register since July 2008. Many other governments including the United Kingdom are debating a register of some kind.\n\nIn the United States, President Barack Obama has introduced several measures intended to increase transparency in public affairs. In an attempt to close the \"revolving door\" of executive-branch officials becoming lobbyists immediately following the expiration of their federal appointments, he issued Executive Order 13490 on January 21, 2009, dictating, among other things, a two-year ban on lobbying for former top executive branch officials related to any issue that they worked on during their final year in government employment. He also introduced a ban on verbal communication between lobbyists and the federal agencies tasked with awarding economic recovery funds. These measures have proved controversial and while some argue they are a positive and necessary step, others have deemed the policies as failures due to various loopholes.\n\nPublic affairs practitioners are engaged in a variety of roles. These can include lobbying, monitoring and predicting political, legal, economic and social developments, and providing political intelligence and strategic advice. In addition, public affairs practitioners may undertake media relations work, understanding and relating with the many streams of business, trade and electronic media in seeking publicity for an organization or in responding to media inquiries and issues. \n\nCentral to all of these areas is the concept of stakeholder relations. Building relationships and partnerships are key when engaging with policymakers.\nConsideration should be given to potential partnership with a variety of groups and individuals, usually encompassed in the ubiquitous public affairs term \"key stakeholders\" which includes community groups, pressure groups, nongovernmental organizations, technical experts and policy and influences from think tanks and academics.\n\n"}
{"id": "6233389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6233389", "title": "RTI International", "text": "RTI International\n\nRTI International (formerly Research Triangle Institute) is a nonprofit organization headquartered in the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina that provides research and technical services. It was founded in 1958 with $500,000 in funding by local businesses and the three North Carolina universities in the Research Triangle region. RTI started with departments for research in isotopes, operational sciences and statistics. It restructured into four departments in 1971 and later created the Office for International Projects, now called the International Development Group. \n\nRTI later split into eleven departments, including Health Research, Drug Discovery & Development, Education & Training Research, Survey Research, among others. The US Agency for International Development has come to account for 35 percent of RTI's research revenue. RTI research has covered HIV/AIDS, healthcare, education curriculum and the environment, among others. Forbes magazine ranked RTI International sixth of 250 in its America’s Best Employers list for mid-size companies for 2016. In 2016, RTI acquired business interests in banking/financial consulting to accompany its profitable RTI-Health Solutions, a unit focused on the pharmaceutical and health technology sectors. \n\nIn 1954, Romeo Guest, a building contractor, met with the North Carolina state treasurer, Brandon Hodges, and the president of Wachovia, Robert Hanes, to discuss building a research park in North Carolina to attract new industries to the region. They obtained support for the concept of Research Triangle Park from state governor Luther Hodges and the three universities that form the research triangle: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University and North Carolina State University. The Research Triangle Institute (now RTI International) was formed as the research park's first tenant in 1958 by the park's founders. The following January they announced that $1.425 million had been raised by the Research Triangle Foundation to fund the park and that $500,000 of it had been set aside for RTI.\n\nRTI started with three divisions: Isotope Development, Operational Sciences and Statistics Research. Its first contract was a $4,500 statistical study of morbidity data from Tennessee. In RTI's first year of operation, it had 25 staff and $240,000 in research contracts. Its early work was focused on statistics, but within a few years expanded into radioisotopes, organic chemistry and polymers. In 1960 the Institute had its first international research contract, for an agricultural census in Nigeria. RTI won contracts with the Department of Education, Defense Department, NASA and the Atomic Energy Commission, growing to $3.4 million in contracts in 1964 and $85 million in 1988. \n\nIn 1971, RTI's staff of 430 was reorganized into four research groups: social and economic systems, statistical sciences, environmental sciences and engineering, and chemistry and life sciences. It also created a division for education called the Center for Education Research and Evaluation. Four years later, RTI created the Office for International Programs to manage international projects. RTI provided funding assistance to help found the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in 1980, and two years later was part of a joint venture to create Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC), a non-profit whose computer network connected local K-12 schools. A Health Solutions division formed in 2000 serves the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. In 2015, it formed a subsidiary in New Delhi, India. Among other projects, it was funded to develop a waterless toilet for use in third-world countries.\n\nRTI International is a not-for-profit research organization that also includes commercial for-profit industries in business consulting and pharmaceutical sectors. RTI was initially established by three local universities, but managed independently by a separate board and management team. RTI's structure consists of members of the corporation, the board of governors and corporate officers. The members of the corporation elect governors, who in turn create the organization's policies. Corporate officers are senior managers that report to the board for their area of responsibility. \n\nRTI has eleven service areas:\nRTI also has a separate business called RTI Health Solutions, which supports biotech, diagnostic and medical device companies. As of 2012, the organization's largest division managed the social, statistical and environmental sciences services. More than half of RTI's staff have advanced degrees in one of 120 fields and work on approximately 1,200 projects at a time. RTI has partnerships with the Research Triangle Energy Consortium, the Triangle Global Health Consortium and other universities and research organizations. Many of RTI's staff hold faculty positions at the three universities that form the Research Triangle and participate in cooperative research projects. \n\nThere are nine US offices and nine international locations in France, the United Kingdom, South America, India and Indonesia, among others, supporting operations in 80 countries. About 60 percent of RTI's staff are headquartered on a 180-acre campus inside the Research Triangle Park. Most of RTI International's funding comes from government research contracts. In 2012 it authored 627 journal articles. RTI staff are not independent researchers, but are instead compensated for their time as salary in exchange for yielding any scientific interests in external publications and extramural funding. At the time, RTI owned 400 patents. RTI competes with the three universities that form the research triangle and other research institutes for contracts. It bids on $2 billion in research contracts a year and wins approximately 40 percent of the budget it bids on. While RTI is technically a non-profit research institute, senior employees are rewarded salary bonuses (4% for senior staff, and 9-15% for managers) based on annual performance and corporate profit. However, employees have no current vested interest or role in corporate governance. \n\nRTI International's research has spanned areas like cancer, pollution, drug abuse and education.\n\nRTI scientists Monroe Wall and Mansukh C. Wani synthesized anti-cancer treatments camptothecin in 1966, from the bark of the Camptotheca tree, and Taxol in 1971, from a Pacific yew tree. These two drugs account for $3 billion a year in sales by pharmaceutical companies. In 1986, RTI was awarded a $4 million contract with the National Cancer Institute to conduct an eight-year clinical trial on the effects of an anti-smoking campaign. Two years later, RTI began a $4.4 million program to coordinate AIDS drug trials for the National Institutes of Health. This had grown to $26 million by 1988.\n\nRTI scientists helped identify toxic chemicals in the Love Canal in the 1970s. In 1978, RTI researched the possibility of improving solar cells for the US Department of Energy and coal gasification for the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979. It trained Chinese government employees on using computer models to forecast pollution patterns before the 2007 Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAn RTI survey in 1973, commissioned by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, confirmed prior research that found no connection between drug use and violent crime, despite prior perceptions of heroin users as more prone to violence. A 1975 study RTI conducted for the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that 28 percent of 13,000 teenagers polled were \"problem drinkers,\" despite their age. A 1996 study done by RTI and funded by the Pentagon found that drug abuse in the military had been reduced by 90 percent since 1980.\n\nRTI in 1975 recommended that the Bureau of the Mint halt expensive production of pennies, and replace half-dollars with a new dollar coin. In 2001, RTI scientists created a new thinfilm superlattice material that uses the thermoelectric effect to cool microprocessors. A 2009 study by RTI and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in \"Health Affairs\" estimated that obesity in the US caused $147 billion in increased medical care costs annually. RTI also developed a reading skill measurement program, the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA), for the USAID and the World Bank. The EGRA has been used in 70 languages and 50 countries.\n\nIn the 1980s, RTI created and distributed the Architecture Design and Assessment System, a set of software programs that helped model intricate systems. The ADAS programs were produced until the mid-1990s.\n\nRTI began working for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) after the conflict between Iraq and the US began in 2003. USAID work represented 35 percent of RTI's revenue by 2010. An employee of the contractor Unity Resources Group, hired to protect RTI staff doing USAID work in Iraq, shot and killed two Iraqi women on October 9, 2007. \n\nIn 2004, Nextreme was spun off of RTI to develop a thermoelectric material for semiconductors commercially.

From an Irish Catholic family in County Cork, Ireland, Hennessy as with many Irishmen of his generation of a Jacobite political tendency, fled into exile with his fellow Wild Geese as part of an Irish Catholic military diaspora, serving in the French Army.\nRichard Hennessy was born in 1724 to James Hennessy and Catherine Barrett at Ballymacmoy House, Killavullen, a small village in County Cork, Ireland. His paternal family were of Gaelic Irish stock; the Hennessys were anciently of the \"Laighin\" and claimed descent from a junior branch of the O'Dempsey family. Specifically with Richard's family, his family were able to restore themselves to a level of prominent through his grandfather's marriage to a daughter of the Norman descended Sir Richard Nagle. \n\nGrowing up an Irish Catholic to a family of some ambition, in the aftermath of the Revolution of 1688, whereby Anglo-Protestant hegemony was operative in Ireland, the young Richard Hennessy at the age of 19 elected to leave the country for Bourbon France. Here he joined the Clare Regiment of the Irish Brigade in the French Army, serving as an officer. This was in the service of king Louis XV of France. Shortly after the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 he became familiar with the Charente region, famous for its cognac production. Using money he had earned in his military career, he decided to become involved in cognac investment from afar, without much success initially.\n\nRichard Hennessy and his cousin James Hennessy went to Ostend in Flanders in 1757 to learn how to trade. Upon returning to France in 1765 he decided to settle in the Charente area permanently with his wife Ellen Barrett (an aunt of the political philosopher Edmund Burke) and their son Jacques Hennessy (11 October 1765 - 22 April 1843). With the assistance of some of the banking houses in Paris, he and two business partners by the name of Connelly and Arthur began trading in cognac from his house.\n\nDuring this time the trade in alcoholic spirits were booming, popular not only with French customers, but also with foreigners, especially people from the British Empire showing interest, leading to a massive boom in cognac in the 1760s. Indeed, in Hennessy’s homeland, the Kingdom of Ireland, spirits from the European Continent were popular, because customs duties were much lower than those practiced in the Kingdom of Great Britain. As well as this there was a shortage of rum due to the Seven Years' War and \"implied that the growing taste for alcohol could only be satisfied by increased imports.\"\n\nHennessy expanded his customer base by shipping the product from Cognac to London, Dublin and Flanders. He also had clients at the Court of the King of France, such as the Prince of Soubise, familiar with the Charente. However, the Hennessy House was still of negligible importance in the 1770s, and Richard Hennessy left the city in 1776 to settle in Bordeaux, where he had associates, as a distiller, in association with alderman George Boyd. It was only in the context of the revolutionary decade that \"the Hennessy, until then a minor house, reached the rank of great.\" Two marriage covenants with an older and firmly established house, the Martells, allowed and endorsed both this promotion in the last decade of the century.\n\n\n"}

He was elected along with Anies Baswedan in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election after defeating incumbent pair Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (widely known as \"Ahok\") and Djarot Saiful Hidayat. He resigned the office to run as Prabowo Subianto's running mate for the 2019 Indonesian presidential election.\n\nA graduate of George Washington University, Sandiaga worked for several companies and rose in rank before founding his own business, which led him to become one of the richest people in Indonesia. In 2015, he resigned from his companies to join Gerindra.\n\nSandi Uno graduated from Wichita State University in 1990 and from George Washington University with an MBA in 1992, paid by William Soerjadjaja, because his mother personally knew the Astra International group founder. He began his career with Summa Bank in 1990. In 1994, he joined MP Group Holding Limited as an investment manager. The following year, he began working for NTI Resources Ltd in Canada and worked as an Executive Vice President in the company. The 1997 financial crisis hit NTI Resources Ltd hard and caused it to go into administration, leaving him unemployed.\n\nIn 1997, he co-founded PT. Recapital Advisors with his high school friend, Rosan Perkasa Roeslani. the following year, he co-founded Saratoga Capital with Edwin Soeryadjaya, son of William Soerjadjaja. Both businesses continue to flourish today. Listed as 29th richest man in Indonesia according to \"Forbes\" magazine in 2009, he continued to grow his businesses, buying a controlling (51%) stake in Mandala Airlines in May 2011. He was listed as 47th richest man in Indonesia according to \"Forbes\" in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, his name appeared on the list of Panama Papers (known as Tax Scandal), although he denies he evaded taxes or broke the law.\n\nHe decided to leave the business world, entering politics in mid-2015. In the period from April to July 2015, he officially resigned from various positions in 16 subsidiaries of Saratoga and Recapital. Joining the Gerindra party as vice chairman of the board of supervisors, he was catapulted to the second highest office after Prabowo. His name began to be considered by Gerindra to be nominated in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election.\n\nLate in 2015, several volunteer community support groups began to emerge, including \"Sahabat Sandiaga Uno\" (Friends of Sandiaga Uno or SSU). He began making visits to various locations within Jakarta. In early 2016, Sandiaga Uno, with assistance of his supporters, began to intensify visits to various locations in Jakarta. Performing visits to up to 7 different locations a day, for the 6-month period from February to August 2016. The rumour of his candidacy intensified, as news leaked of the desire of 7 political parties to form a grand coalition in August 2016.\n\nThis desire was not realised following the withdrawal the ruling PDI-P party, which threw its weight behind incumbent governor Ahok, along with Golkar, Hanura and Nasdem. The Democratic Party, PAN, PKB and PPP then announced it planned to nominate Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono (son of former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono) for the position.\n\nThe remaining parties, Gerindra and PKS, agreed to remain in the coalition, selecting former Education Minister Anies Baswedan as their candidate, and Sandiaga Uno as his running mate. Sandi said, he had suggested Baswedan to Prabowo because he felt that Baswedan would be more suitable for the position.\n\nFollowing victory in the election, which an editorial described as \"the most polarizing and most divisive the nation has ever seen in Indonesian political history,\" and the incarceration of Ahok, he was made vice governor on 16 October 2017.\n\nIn 2018, he was accused of paying opposition parties PAN and PKS Rp 500 billion (USD 35 million) each to approve him as Prabowo Subianto's vice presidential candidate for the 2019 presidential election. Regardless, he declared his resignation from his office to participate in the election on 10 August 2018. The resignation was made official on 18 September 2018.\n\nIn November 2017 an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism cited his name in the list of politicians named in \"Paradise Papers\" allegations. He was claimed to have own an offshore company named NTI resources, as well as several shell companies in British Virgin Islands. Regarding this, the Indonesian Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, vowed to study the legitimacy of the paper, and will take an appropriate measure if there was any wrongdoing conducted.\n\nEven before his appointment to the vice governorship, Sandiaga proceeded to execute plans mentioned during his campaigning. In early October, an entrepreneurship program dubbed \"OK OCE\" (One Kecamatan, One Center for Entrepreneurship), which he had called for during the election, was initiated with his elder brother Indra initially acting as president, although the following day he was replaced due to nepotism concerns.\n\nThere were multiple reports in Indonesia that Sandiaga Uno was appointed as a distinguished research professor in residence at George Washington University.\n"}

It caters for children for whom mainstream schooling has become insufficient, for varying reasons. The school's motto is \"Rebuilding Lives Through Education.\"\n\nThe school, founded in its current form as a charitable trust on 14 September 1998 as the Beth Marie Centre, is based in of parkland on lease from Mohamed Al-Fayed, who contributed almost £3 million towards the school. The building formerly housed the school where Diana Spencer, later Princess of Wales and her two older sisters, Sarah and Jane, received their childhood education. It was then called West Heath Girls' School and was a very exclusive girls' school with around 100 boarding pupils.\n\nThe Reverend Philip Bennet Power and his wife, Emma, undertook the education of their own daughters at their Abbey Wood home, West Heath House. The quality of the girls' education attracted other local families to ask the Powers to teach their children and West Heath School thus opened in 1865. \n\nIn 1879 the expanding school moved to 1 Ham Common, in what was then the agricultural community of Ham, Surrey. The house, set in over of grounds, was the former residence of the Duc de Chartres. \n\nIn 1890 Misses Sarah, Maria and Anna Buckland and Miss Jane Percival who owned a similar school in Reading joined forces with the ageing Mrs Power at Ham Common and they ran the school until its purchase in 1900 by Misses Emma Lawrence and Margaret Skeat. Miss Elliott joined the staff in 1928 and was appointed Principal the following year. \n\nThe development of nearby shops and housing prompted a second move, Ham having become \"too suburbanised for a high class girls' school\". In 1932 the school moved to its present site, the 18th century Ashgrove House, near Sevenoaks, the former home of the Elliot family. The larger premises allowed the school to grow from its previous capacity at Ham of about seventy boarders, to over one hundred by the end of the Second World War. \n\nIn addition to the Spencer sisters, Issy Van Randwyck, Annabel Croft and Tilda Swinton were educated there.\n\nIn the 1990s the school had financial difficulties due to falling numbers of pupils, and was placed into receivership in 1997.\n\nThe Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund considered buying the school, but decided against it, and Mohamed Al Fayed stepped in to buy West Heath for £2,300,000 on 20 May 1998 as new premises for the Beth Marie Centre. He later pledged to contribute a further £550,000 towards equipping the school. In a statement, he said:\n\nThe school was founded in its current form, with Valerie May as Principal, on 14 September 1998. At the start it had around 30 pupils.

{"id": "38879282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38879282", "title": "Theodorico de Sacadura Botte", "text": "Theodorico de Sacadura Botte\n\nTheodorico César de Sande Pacheco de Sacadura Botte (Quinta da Bica, Portugal, October 31, 1902 - Maputo, Mozambique, November 18, 1987), commonly known as Theodorico de Sacadura Botte, was a Portuguese colonial administrator and entrepreneur.\n\nBorn into a Portuguese rural aristocratic family, Sacadura Botte left Lisbon and moved to the Portuguese African Overseas in the wave of State takeover of the colonial administration from the British-owned private companies it was formerly commissioned to. After many years as a colonial administrator, and having been Administrator of two different districts, as well as Chief of Cabinet of the Governor of Mozambique, he became an entrepreneur and businessman, with strong interests in international trade, real estate, horticulture and agriculture.\n\nAfter the fall of the Portuguese authoritarian regime known as Estado Novo, all Portuguese overseas territories in Africa were granted independence. Most of the political factions that took over these new countries were marxist guerilla movements, which started a wave of nationalization of properties and businesses, as well as, in many cases, persecution of Portuguese nationals. Although Sacadura Botte saw most of his property taken or destroyed and most of his family and friends exiled, he remained in Mozambique and acknowledged the new regime, thus earning the respect of the new leaders and of the Mozambican people, who mostly left him in peace. This was also, in all likeliness, fueled by the fact that he was considered a just and kind governor by the people under his rule in both his jurisdictions.\n\nIn his final years, he wrote a memoir, titled \"Memórias e Autobiografia: 24 anos em Portugal e 60 em Africa\" (Memoirs and Autobiography: 24 years in Portugal and 60 in Africa), which told his life story and is considered by many to be a great instrument of insight into the final years of the Portuguese Overseas Empire, as well as an interesting account of most of the 20th century through the eyes of a member of the last generation of Portuguese colonialists.\n\nTheodorico de Sacadura Botte died in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, on November 18, 1987, aged 85.\n\nSacadura Botte was born on 31 October 1902 at the family manor of Quinta da Bica, in Seia, Portugal, near Serra da Estrela. He was the fifth and last son of João Pacheco de Sacadura Botte, 8th Lord of the Bica House and Estate, and Maria da Ascenção Mendes de Oliva, second daughter of the Lords of Ponte Pedrinha. His father was a magistrate, landowner and winemaker, as well as a monarchist politician and candidate for the Beira region. As a young boy, Theodorico lived through the fall of the Portuguese Monarchy, much to the dismay of his traditional, Catholic and monarchist family, and helped his father in his campaign as monarchist candidate to the government of the region where they lived in Portugal, albeit unsuccessfully.\n\nHe started his studies in Coimbra, and then studied Business and Economical Sciences, at the \"Instituto Superior de Comércio\" in Lisbon. After finishing his studies, he considered the diplomatical career, but could not follow this idea due to the republican nature of the Portuguese regime at the time, with which he profoundly disagreed. For the following two years, he ran the agricultural production of his father’s estate. Afterwards, and giving up the idea of joining the diplomatic corps, he was invited by his good friend José de Moura Forjaz de Gusmão, then manager of the “Sociedade Colonial de Tabacos”, the Portuguese Colonial Tobacco Society, to move to Africa on a three-year commission, as a bookkeeper for that same company. Accepting the invitation, and against his family’s wishes, Sacadura Botte left for the Portuguese colony of São Tomé and Príncipe, boarding the \"Angola\" steamship, in Lisbon, on May 31, 1926.\n\nIt was also during his early years that Sacadura Botte developed many of the interests that would accompany him through life. He discovered his favourite sports, horse-riding and hunting, early in life, being initiated into both in his family's estate. He also had his first close contact with silviculture, which went on to become a later years passion, in one of his maternal family's estates, Quinta do Outeiro, where his maternal grandfather, Theodorico César Mendes de Oliva, created a well known botanical garden known as \"Bussaquinho\", because of its similarity to the famous Bussaco forest.\n\nAfter stops in Madeira, the Canary Islands, Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe and Luanda, Sacadura Botte finally arrived in Lourenço Marques, capital of the Portuguese overseas province of Mozambique, in late June, 1926. He took over his job as bookkeeper for the Lourenço Marques factory of the Colonial Tobacco Society, and moved into the Cardoso Hotel, where he lived during his first tenure in Mozambique.\n\nAfter little over two years in Mozambique, Sacadura Botte was invited to fill in for the manager of the Luanda factory of the same company, Pedro de Figueiredo e Lemos, who was leaving for Portugal for a year. After taking the offer, he moved to Luanda, where he lived in the manager's suite on the factory premises. After Figueiredo e Lemos' return from Portugal, Sacadura Botte travelled to São Tomé for a month, where he inspected the many tobacco plantations on that island that supplied the Colonial Tobacco Society. After finishing the inspection, and upon arriving in Lourenço Marques, he took over as manager of the Lourenço Marques factory, this time filling in for José de Moura Forjaz de Gusmão, who was leaving for Portugal, also for a year.\n\nLittle before Moura Forjaz de Gusmão's return, Sacadura Botte decided to leave the tobacco industry for a career in public administration. Although he was highly regarded within the Tobacco Society, both Figueiredo e Lemos and Moura Forjaz de Gusmão were young and bound to stay on as managers for a long time, and Sacadura Botte felt he should move beyond his bookkeeper position, so he decided to try a different career.\n\nDuring his first years in Africa, Sacadura Botte often indulged in the pleasures of one of his favourites sports: game hunting. During his many years in Africa, he hunted alongside famous hunters like German aristocrat Baron Werner von Alvensleben, Portuguese industrialist Hermínio Madeira Leitão (who would become Theodorico's son João's father in law), brothers and businessmen José Diogo and Manuel Mascarenhas Gaivão, and his great friend Maximiano Cotta. Sacadura Botte, aside from regular hunting expeditions, also joined many Portuguese colonial figures in hunting trips, having hunted alongside, José Frederico Ulrich, who would later become Portugal's Minister of Public Works, and many others.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the colonization of many of Portugal's overseas provinces was concessioned to private companies, due to Portugal's lack of funds to pursue the development of these areas. One of said companies was the Niassa Company, whose concession covered the regions of Niassa and Cabo Delgado, among others in the Portuguese East Africa. On October 27, 1929, the Niassa Company's concession expired, and the Portuguese Government refused to grant an extension. This refusal was due to the Ditadura Nacional regime's belief that the state should head colonization.\n\nIn this wave of state takeover of colonial administration, many formerly concessioned districts were now in need of an administrator. The Governor of Mozambique opened a selection process to choose who would occupy these positions. Theodorico de Sacadura Botte, having, as earlier stated, decided to try a different career in which he could have a greater degree of autonomy, applied. He was one of the three chosen candidates, alongside Lieutenants Ribeiro da Silva and Pinto da Fonseca, and chose to administrate the district of Magude.\n\nIn his first tenure as District Administrator of Magude, he showed many of the traits that would accompany him throughout his career as a colonial administration. His strong opposition to the forced labour system known as chibalo, as well as his strong defense of the native people and cooperation with local tribes gained enormous respect from the Mozambican population. This was at a time in which natives were used as cheap labour for many of the landowners, and were mostly at their mercy. Although Sacadura Botte faced some opposition at first, soon his uncompromising stand and firm ideals prevailed.\n\nDuring his time as district administrator, he often went on hunting and riding expeditions, as he so much enjoyed, having at one point lead the hunting expedition devised to obtain a buffalo worthy of figuring in Portugal's exposition in the Exposition Universelle in Paris.\n\nDuring a stay at a country club he met Incomati Sugar Estates manager Thomas Newman and his wife Leila. They agreed to play a tennis doubles match, and Sacadura Botte was paired with Leila Newman's sister Sheila May Younger. After this first encounter, Sacadura Botte began courting Sheila May, and after her conversion to Catholicism, they were eventually married by Father Alfredo Corrêa de Lima, in Magude. Sheila was the youngest daughter of then already deceased William Douglas Younger, of the renown Younger family, of Clackmannanshire, Scotland, and his Australian-born British wife, Leila May.\n\nDuring his term in Magude, Sacadura Botte earned the respect of the locals through his reputation for being a just and fair administrator. His often unorthodox methods in fighting inequality and his refusal to accommodate existing lobbies, especially those which attempted to corrupt him or his officials, garnered him some enemies during that period. Once, upon realizing that the Portuguese businessmen were buying cattle from the locals at a price much lower than its worth, Sacadura Botte forbade any cattle from being sold or bought until fair prices were paid. After some time being unable to buy cattle, the businessmen accepted the fair prices proposed by Sacadura Botte and commerce resumed as usual.\n\nSacadura Botte wrote a three-volume set of \"memoirs\", called \"Memórias e Autobiografia\", which have been considered an insightful look at the final years of the Portuguese Colonial Empire through the eyes of one of its last great colonialists. \n\nHe was also the inspiration for a poem, titled simply \"T.S.B.\", written by Portuguese ambassador to Mozambique José Cutileiro, in which he is compared to Prospero, from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", and the new Mozambican regime to Caliban, from the same play.\n<br>\nToday I have met Prospero.<br>\nLiving in an island under Caliban's rule.<br>\nHe opted out but he did not go<br>\nAnd treads the ground and breathes the air with no<br>\nAllegiance of a subject to the fool<br>\n<br>\nFifty or more years ago<br>\nHe came to settle and has not left since.<br>\nThe lifetime of a Master.

WPS allows users to create, edit and run programs written in the language of SAS.\n\nThe program was the subject of a lawsuit by SAS Institute. The EU Court of Justice ruled in favor of World Programming, stating that the copyright protection does not extend to the software functionality, the programming language used and the format of the data files used by the program. It stated that there is no copyright infringement when a company which does not have access to the source code of a program studies, observes and tests that program to create another program with the same functionality.\n\nWPS can use programs written in the language of SAS without the need for translating them into any other language. In this regard WPS is compatible with the SAS system. WPS is a language interpreter able to process the language of SAS and produce similar results.\n\nWPS is available to run on Mainframe z/OS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Linux for Arm8 64-bit (AArch64), PowerLinux, POWER/System p/pSeries (LE), Solaris, AIX and Linux on Mainframe System z.\n\nOn all supported platforms, programs written in the language of SAS can be executed from a WPS command line interface, often referred to as running in batch mode.\n\nWPS can also be used from a graphical user interface known as the WPS Workbench for managing, editing and running programs written in the language of SAS. The WPS Workbench user interface is based on Eclipse.\n\nWPS version 4 (released in March 2018) introduced a drag-and-drop workflow canvas providing interactive blocks for data retrieval, blending and preparation, data discovery and profiling, predictive modelling powered by machine learning algorithms, model performance validation and scorecards.\n\nWPS version 3 (released in February 2012) provides a new client/server architecture that allows the WPS Workbench GUI to execute SAS programs on remote server installations of WPS in a network or cloud. The resulting output, data sets, logs, etc., can then all be viewed and manipulated from inside the Workbench as if the workloads had been executed locally. SAS programs do not require any special language statements to use this feature.\n\nIn 2010 World Programming defended its use of the language of SAS in the High Court of England and Wales in \"SAS Institute Inc. v World Programming Ltd\".\n\n\nGartner recognized World Programming in their Cool Vendors in Data Science, 2014 Report.\n\n"}
