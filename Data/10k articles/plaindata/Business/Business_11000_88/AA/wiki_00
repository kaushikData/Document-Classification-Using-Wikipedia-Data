Between October 2015 and April 2017 he was Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.\n\nAbdullah bin Faisal was born in Taif in 1951. His mother, Luluwah bint Abdulaziz, is the full sister of Sudairi Seven. He has six siblings and is the oldest of them. His brother, Sultan bin Faisal bin Turki, was killed in a car crash at age 41 on 23 July 2002 while coming from Jeddah to Riyadh to participate in funeral prayers for Prince Ahmed, son of Prince Salman, who has been the King of Saudi Arabia since 2015.\n\nPrince Abdullah's family on the father's side is directly descended from Saud bin Faisal. Saud's rule as well as that of his brother Abdullah marked the end of the second Saudi state after an invasion of Ottomans early in the 19th century.\n\nPrince Abdullah received elementary and secondary education in Saudi Arabia. He then went to the United Kingdom for higher education where he studied engineering.\n\nPrince Abdullah's early career as an engineer involved both technical and management positions. He assumed the responsibility of the coordination of various studies for the two industrial cities, and later for the industrial security and safety sector.\n\nAbdullah bin Faisal began his career at the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu immediately after its establishment in 1975. He served as the acting secretary general of the Royal Commission from 1985 to 1987. Then, he was appointed secretary general of the royal commission in 1987. Next, he was appointed chairman of the body in 1991 and he served as chief executive officer of the commission and chairman of its board of directors. \nIn April 2000, Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) was created, responsible for promotions of the foreign and domestic investments in Saudi Arabia. Prince Abdullah was appointed governor of SAGIA with the rank of minister in 2000. His tenure lasted until 2004 when he resigned from this post. It was speculated that since he was frustrated with the government’s bureaucratic approach and the slow pace of the reforms in the country, he left SAGIA.\n\nPrince Abdullah was the chairman of Saudi Italian Development Company (SIDCO), charged with the task of revitalizing Saudi Arabia's economy. Since he had knowledge of the Italian economy, he was regarded as the most appropriate figure to support the commercial relations between Saudi Arabia and Italy.\n\nIn October 2015 Prince Abdullah became the Saudi ambassador to the USA. He succeeded Adel al-Jubeir in the post. On 23 April 2017 Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud replaced Prince Abdullah as ambassador to the USA.\n\nWhen Prince Abdullah was the governor of SAGIA, he strongly supported both liberal policies and privatization in the Saudi Arabia’s economy. Nearly 2,000 foreign business licenses were issued during his tenure. The worth of these licenses were estimated to be 15 billion U.S. dollars. Prince Abdullah further encouraged the membership of Saudi Arabia to the World Trade Organization. However, this goal was not achieved at that time because of Saudi Arabia’s protectionist policies towards the industries of oil production and telecommunications, and its inability to produce a formal trade agreement with the United States.\n\nAbdullah bin Faisal is married and has four children: Turki, Salman, Elanoude and Sarah. He is keenly interested in environmental issues and in international relations as well as in the arts.\n"}

First-year associates are entry-level junior attorneys and are generally recent law school graduates in their first year of law practice.\n\nGenerally, an associate has the goal of being made a partner in the firm, after a number of years gaining practice experience and being assigned to increasingly important and remunerative tasks. At firms with an \"up or out\" policy, associates who are repeatedly passed over for promotion to partner may be asked to resign. Some firms will also have \"non-partner-track\" associates who, though performing satisfactorily as employees, for whatever reason, will not be promoted to partner.\n\nJunior attorneys were formerly called \"law clerks\"; the term \"associate attorney\" was coined by Emory Buckner, hiring partner of Root, Clark & Bird (which subsequently became Dewey Ballantine) in the 1920s. The term \"law clerk\" now generally refers to an attorney who serves as a research and writing assistant in a judge's chambers, although some law firms use the term to refer to a lawyer or non-lawyer who has specialized knowledge in one of the firm's practice areas but is not classified as a practicing attorney at the law firm.\n\nSummer associates are current law students who have usually completed their second year of school (or in some cases, their first year of law school) and are interning at the firm for the summer. Summer associates have not passed the bar exam and are not attorneys. The summer associate program is often the primary method by which a law firm recruits for full-time associate positions.\n\nAccording to published data from the New York Times, the annual base salary for partner-track first year associate attorneys at top law firms in major U.S. legal markets such as New York, California, Massachusetts, the District of Columbia, and Texas can range from $160,000 to $180,000 per year—with salary varying depending on the size and reputation of the firm.\n"}

It falls under the remit of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and is also a member of the Public Data Group. All forms of companies (as permitted by the United Kingdom Companies Act) are incorporated and registered with Companies House and file specific details as required by the current Companies Act 2006. All registered limited companies, including subsidiary, small and inactive companies, must file annual financial statements in addition to annual company returns, which are all public records. Only some registered unlimited companies (meeting certain conditions) are exempt from this requirement.\n\nThe United Kingdom has had a system of company registration since 1844. The legislation governing company registration matters is the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 permitted the incorporation of joint-stock companies, previously only possible by the mechanisms of royal charter or private act, which had meant few companies were formed. The act therefore required that all companies formed under it were recorded on a public register, and created the office of Registrar of Joint Stock Companies to be responsible for maintaining the register.\n\nCompany registration in Scotland commenced in 1856, with the first company registered being 'The Daily Bulletin Limited'. The first Registrar of Joint Stock Companies for Scotland was George Deane from 1856 to 1858, before he was transferred to the London office of Companies House to be Chief Clerk to the Registrar for England and Wales.\n\nThe remaining staff were transferred to the office of the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer (Q&LTR), who took on the role of Registrar of Companies for Scotland.\n\nIn 1982 the post of Q&LTR was transferred to the Crown Agent and the staff and functions relating to companies registration in Scotland were transferred to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on 1 April 1981.\n\nIn October 1988, Companies House became an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, and then in October 1991 started to operate as a trading fund, self-financing by retaining income from charges.\n\nEngland and Wales are treated as a single entity (companies may be ‘Registered in England and Wales’) with a unified register, separate from those of Scotland or Northern Ireland. Companies must advise Companies House of their intended registered office (the official address of the company), which may be in England and Wales, in Scotland, or in Wales. Consequently, on incorporation, companies will be either ‘Registered in England and Wales’, ‘Registered in Scotland’, or ‘Registered in Wales’. Effectively, companies in England must register in England and Wales, companies in Scotland must register in Scotland, while companies in Wales may choose to register in either England and Wales, or in Wales.\n\nAlthough actual legal registration is in either England and Wales, or in Wales, according to Companies House companies must display the company registered office location in a format similar to one of the following suggested formats:\n\"“On all company’s business letters, order forms (in hard copy, electronic or any other form) and its websites, the company must show in legible lettering:\"\n\n\"(a) the part of the United Kingdom in which the company is registered which is:\"\n\n\"For Companies registered in England and Wales either:\"\n\n\nThe Companies House office in Cardiff handles companies incorporated in England and Wales.

The role of Chief Registrar is not a political one and the incumbent is a civil servant. The previous Chief Executive was Tim Moss.\n\nCompanies House is also responsible for dissolving companies.\n\nThe Edinburgh office handles companies incorporated in Scotland.

The results came from Datanomic who had screened the 6.8 million names on the register against a World-Check database of high risk individuals and businesses.

The time and place of the auction is published in official records.\n\nIn case the value of the debt being foreclosed on is substantially less than the market value of the real property, this can finish the trouble for the debitor by paying all the credits.\n\nIn Germany the court may suspend the auction for 6 months on the debtor's justified request. Justification may be hardship, e.g. if debtor has a physical disability and cannot find adequate housing. The creditor can object up to twice if the result of the auction is not sufficient to fulfil the claim. The bidder must deposit security in the amount of 10%. The highest bidder becomes the owner of the real property. If the claim is greater than the market value of the real property, debts are handled in an insolvency proceeding.\n\nSpanish mortgage holders are responsible for the full amount of the loan to the bank in addition to penalty interest charges, and court fees.\n\nHistorically, the vast majority of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money with which to hire counsel. The highest bidder at the auction becomes the owner of the real property, free and clear of interest of the former owner. In 2009 there was a growing consensus that the deepening collapse of the housing market was at the heart of the country’s acute economic downturn. The rules for court auction differ in the states.\n\n"}

It also connotes a higher authority given to lower level functionaries, executives, and workers. This can be in any organization of any size, from a governmental authority to a corporation. However, the context in which the term is used is generally that of larger organizations. This distribution of power, in effect, has far-reaching implications for the fields of management, organizational behavior, and government.\n\nThe decisions arising from a process of decentralized decision-making are the functional result of group intelligence and crowd wisdom. Decentralized decision-making also contributes to the core knowledge of group intelligence and crowd wisdom, often in a subconscious way a la Carl Jung's collective unconscious.\n\nDecision theory is a method of deductive reasoning based on formal probability and deductive reasoning models. It is also studied in a specialized field of mathematics wherein models are used to help make decisions in all human activities including the sciences and engineering. (See also Game theory, Uncertainty, Expectation maximization principle.)\n\nDecentralization and centralization have been consistent themes throughout history pertaining to governmental authority and political theory. From the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, there have been periods of centralization and decentralization in societies worldwide. Almost any political movement, from the rise of city states in Roman times, to the later rise and downfall of feudal empires during the middle ages, to the rise of fascism in Germany prior to World War II, to the late 20th century formation of the European Economic Union, the history of Europe has been one of cycles of centralization and decentralization.\n\nMIT Professor Thomas W. Malone explains that \"decentralization has three general benefits:\n\n\nDecentralized decision-making, Malone says, tends to create less rigidity and flatter hierarchies in organizations. When upper management delegates decision-making responsibilities, there also exist wider spans of control among managers, creating a more lateral flow of information. Thus there will be more bottom up directional information flow, allowing for more innovation and efficiency closer to the means of production. This increased flow information thereby allows for innovation in what is called Total quality management.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "68804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68804", "title": "Equity (finance)", "text": "Equity (finance)\n\nIn accounting, equity (or owner's equity) is the difference between the value of the assets and the value of the liabilities of something owned. It is governed by the following equation:\nFor example, if someone owns a car worth $15,000 (an asset), but owes $5,000 on a loan against that car (a liability), the car represents $10,000 of equity. Equity can be negative if liabilities exceed assets. Shareholders' equity (or stockholders' equity, shareholders' funds, shareholders' capital or similar terms) represents the equity of a company as divided among shareholders of common or preferred stock. Negative shareholders' equity is often referred to as a shareholders' deficit.\n\nAlternatively, equity can also refer to a corporation's share capital (\"capital stock\" in American English). The value of the share capital depends on the corporation's future economic prospects. For a company in liquidation proceedings, the equity is that which remains after all liabilities have been paid.\n\nWhen starting a business, the owners fund the business to finance various operations. Under the model of a private limited company, the business and its owners are separate entities, so the business is considered to owe these funds to its owners as a liability in the form of share capital. Throughout the business's existence, the equity of the business will be the difference between its assets and debt liabilities; this is the accounting equation.\n\nWhen a business liquidates during bankruptcy, the proceeds from the assets are used to reimburse creditors. The creditors are ranked by priority, with secured creditors being paid first, other creditors being paid next, and owners being paid last. Owner's equity (also known as risk capital or liable capital) is this remaining or residual claim against assets, which is paid only after all other creditors are paid. In such cases where even creditors could not get enough money to pay their bills, the owner's equity is reduced to zero because nothing is left to reimburse it.\n\nIn financial accounting, owner's equity consists of the net assets of an entity. Net assets is the difference between the total assets and total liabilities. Equity appears on the balance sheet (also known as the statement of financial position), one of the four primary financial statements.\n\nThe assets of an entity can be both tangible and intangible items. Intangible assets include items such as brand names, copyrights or goodwill. Tangible assets include land, equipment, and cash. The types of accounts and their description that comprise the owner's equity depend on the nature of the entity and may include:\n\nThe book value of equity will change in the case of the following events:\n\nWhen the owners are shareholders, the interest can be called shareholders' equity; the accounting remains the same, and it is ownership equity spread out among shareholders. If all shareholders are in one and the same class, they share equally in ownership equity from all perspectives. However, shareholders may allow different priority ranking among themselves by the use of share classes and options. This complicates analysis for both stock valuation and accounting.\n\nShareholders' equity is obtained by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of the shareholders. These assets and liabilities can be:\n\n\nAn equity investment generally refers to the buying and holding of shares of stock on a stock market by individuals and firms in anticipation of income from dividends and capital gains. Typically, equity holders receive voting rights, meaning that they can vote on candidates for the board of directors (shown on a diversification of the fund(s) and to obtain the skill of the professional fund managers in charge of the fund(s)). An alternative, which is usually employed by large private investors and pension funds, is to hold shares directly; in the institutional environment many clients who own portfolios have what are called segregated funds, as opposed to or in addition to the pooled mutual fund alternatives.\n\nA calculation can be made to assess whether an equity is over or underpriced, compared with a long-term government bond. This is called the yield gap or Yield Ratio. It is the ratio of the dividend yield of an equity and that of the long-term bond.\n\nIn the stock market, market price per share does not correspond to the equity per share calculated in the accounting statements. Equity stock valuations, which are often much higher, are based on other considerations related to the business' operating cash flow, profits and future prospects; some factors are derived from the accounting statement. While accounting equity can potentially be negative, market price per share is never negative since equity shares represent ownership in limited liability companies. The principle of limited liability guarantees that a shareholder's losses may never exceed his investment.\n\nUnder the \"Merton model\", the value of stock equity is modeled as a call option on the value of the whole company (including the liabilities), struck at the nominal value of the liabilities. Here, the equity market value depends on the volatility of the market value of the company assets.\n\nThis is the first example of a \"structural model\", where bankruptcy is modeled using a microeconomic model of the firm's capital structure - it treats bankruptcy as a continuous probability of default, where, on the random occurrence of default, the stock price of the defaulting company is assumed to go to zero. \nThis microeconomic approach, to some extent, allows us to answer the question \"what are the economic causes of default?\". \n\nThe notion of equity as it relates to real estate derives from the concept called equity of redemption. This equity is a property right valued at the difference between the market value of the property and the amount of any mortgage or other encumbrance.\n\n"}

Such false self-employment is often a way to circumvent social welfare and employment legislation, for example by avoiding employer's social security and income tax contributions. While a modern \"gig economy\" encourages more casual employment practices in the interests of labour flexibility, the extent to which this disguises precarious employment and denial of rights is of growing concern to authorities.\n\nThere is a grey area of self-employed persons who rely heavily on a single customer while legitimately being independent.\n\nA salaried-work relation hidden behind a false pretense of self-employment is in some jurisdictions a violation of and a non‑compliance with labour law.\n\nFor social security, the falsely self-employed is declared not to be subject to employment law, but actually works under an employer’s authority in a , with the same conditions as his salaried colleagues but without any employment contract.\n\nWhen a salaried-work relation is hidden under such a false pretense, there is a violation of law and both parties expose themselves to sanctions.\n\nThe constitutive elements of an employment contract typically are:\n\nThe (Belgian) legislator considers the following elements to define a subordinate relationship:\nLabour law tends in a jurisprudential way to view self-employment as false when many of the above elements are present.\n\nThe ministers’ council (the Belgian Cabinet) on 5 May 2006 examined a legislative proposal (a bill) which no longer refers to a “faux indépedant” (read: falsely self-employed person), but to \"qualification adequate de la nature des relations de travail\" (\"appropriate qualification about the nature of relationships at work\"), whether salaried or independent. The bill came from the minister of small business, Sabine Laruelle (MR political party – liberal), and the minister of social affairs, Rudy Demotte (PS political party – socialist). The governmental declaration of July 2004 already planned such a bill.\n\nThe legislative proposal confirms the general principles stated by the jurisprudence and the Court of Cassation: to have an employment contract, there must be a relationship of authority and subordination; (and) to have a contract between independent actors, there must be no such relationship. This reflects the party’s intention as expressed in their programme. Elements such as freedom to organise one’s working time/period, freedom to organise one's work and the possibility to have a hierarchical control allow to evaluate the existence or not of any hierarchical relationship.\n\nMoreover, this establishes legal certainty: the current system of freedom of contract between parties is confirmed, the potential problems are framed either in specific sectors, or in individual situations.\n\nA British trade union UCATT which specialized in the construction industry has expressed concern that false self-employment was being used by many British employers to evade taxes and engage workers without having to respect employment rights and entitlements such as holiday pay, sick pay and pensions. In their opinion, whilst the practice was immoral, it was not, in their view, necessarily illegal.\nThe UK taxation arrangement known as the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) allowed registered companies to deduct tax at source and thus avoid employing workers directly as their regular or casual employee who would thus have acquired legal employee rights.\n\nInstead casual staff could be assumed to be sub-contractors who were falsely supposed to be self-employed, and thus responsible for paying their own tax and social security contributions.\n\nIf such persons were not registered as self-employed, they would thereby be liable for unlawfully evading their legal obligations.\n\nThe British Government’s HM Revenue and Customs service found in 2013 evidence that some companies and employment businesses connected with the offshore oil industry were using employment intermediaries to disguise the employment of their workers as self-employment, primarily to avoid paying employers National Insurance contributions and to reduce the costs associated with workers’ employment rights.\n\nThe Spanish Ministry of Employment is trying (as of mid August 2017) to address commercial accounting agencies who invoice employers on behalf of regular employees falsely presented self-employed persons to evade or minimise their tax and social security obligations (Self employed people are known as autónomos in Spanish, and usually raise their own invoices for irregular work assignments themselves). Fidelis Factu Sociedad Cooperativa, better known as Factoo, has been obliged to close its operation following a sanction imposed by the Ministry. There are known to be several other cooperatives of this type, although Factoo is the largest so far identified and the first to be shut down.\n\n\n"}

The Franchise Rule is published by the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe Franchise Rule seeks to facilitate informed decisions and to prevent deception in the sale of franchises by requiring franchisors to provide prospective franchisees with essential information prior to the sale. It does not, however, regulate the substance of the terms that control the relationship between franchisors and franchisees.\nAlso, while The Franchise Rule removed the regulation of the sale of franchises from the purview of the states under the authority of the FTC to regulate interstate commerce, The FTC Franchise Rule does not require franchisors to disclose the unit performance statistics of the franchised system to new buyers of franchises as would be necessary and material under state and federal Securities and Exchange law.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has oversight of franchising, rather than the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \nThe FTC administrates oversight via the FTC Franchise Rule. \nThe FTC announced an update to the franchise Rule on January 23, 2007, becoming effective July 1, 2007.\n\nThe most recent version of the FTC \"Franchise Rule\" was in 2007, is printed in .\n\nAfter July 2008, all franchisors in the United States are to use the Franchise Disclosure Document with potential franchisees.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission began examining practices in franchising in 1970. In 1971 the FTC began a formal rule making proceeding, to possibly develop a regulation requiring disclosure and prohibiting unfair practices in offering and selling franchises. These developments resulted in promulgation of the FTC Franchise Rule in 1979. The FTC enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act (\"FTC Act\"), which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\n\nThe FTC Act also empowers the Commission to prescribe rules that define with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive. One such rule is the Commission's Franchise Rule.\n\nThe Commission focuses much of its Franchise Rule enforcement and consumer educational resources on combating business opportunity fraud.\n\nThe Franchise Rule requires franchisors to make material disclosures in five categories: \n\nIn addition, franchisors must have a reasonable basis and substantiation for any earnings claims made to prospective franchisees, as well as disclose the basis and assumptions underlying any such earnings claims. Earnings Claims are not required to be provided to prospective franchisees under the FTC Rule and the majority of franchisors do not make earnings claims and do not disclose the unit performance statics of their franchisees to prospective franchisees.\n\nThe Franchise Rule generally covers two different types of business arrangements: franchises and business opportunity ventures.\n\nFranchise agreements typically involve retail outlets that bear the franchisor's trademark and follow the franchisor's business operations model, such as fast-food restaurants, hotels, and automotive repair shops. These are commonly known as \"business-format\" franchises.\n\nFranchise business opportunities rip offs often do not entail a trademark or detailed business plan. \nThe franchise business opportunity typically promises to provide the buyer with equipment that is used to sell products or services to the public, such as vending machines, rack displays, pay phones, or medical billing software, and frequently promises to find the buyer a market for the products or services.\nMany business opportunities are outright scams that disappear shortly after taking consumers' money. Compliance with The Franchise Rule by business opportunity sellers is low.\n\nIn addition to the FTC, fifteen states require pre-sale disclosure in franchise sales in the form of a Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (\"UFOC\"). \nBecause a UFOC is accepted by both the states and the FTC, the UFOC Guidelines have effectively become the national franchise disclosure standard.\n\nThe Franchise Rule has the force and effect of law, and it may be enforced through civil penalty actions in federal courts.(10) The FTC Act authorizes courts to impose civil penalties of not more than $11,000 per compliance violation.\n\nThe Franchise Rule requires franchisors to provide all potential franchisees with a disclosure document containing 23 specific items of information about the offered franchise, its officers, and other franchisees.\n\nRequired Franchise Disclosure Document topics include: the franchise’s litigation history, past and current franchisees and their contact information, any exclusive territory that comes with the franchise, assistance the franchisor provides franchisees, and the cost of purchasing and starting up a franchise. If a franchisor makes representations about the financial performance of the franchise, this topic also must be covered, as well as the material basis backing up those representations.\" \nFranchise termination is covered in the franchise agreement between the franchiser and franchisee. In the 2007 Franchise Rule, comments from former franchisees were listed concerning confidentiality agreements and Franchise fraud.\n\n\n"}

Frederick and Isabelle were leading personalities in Nelson. She died in 1936, he died in 1945. They were survived by four daughters and two sons.\n\nFrancis Hamilton bought E Buxton & Co, general merchants in 1881 and greatly expanded the business so that it handled a large wholesale and retail trade in agricultural, mining, building and household equipment and groceries. As a stock and station agency it handled wool hops and barley, purchased directly from farmers. The barley was malted and supplied to local breweries.\n\nAfter the business was restructured in 1936 it was renamed Buxton's. In 1963 it was sold to Wright Stephenson & Co.\n\nFrederick Hamilton entered the firm ten years after his father had purchased it. After three years he went to work for the hardware business of Briscoe, MacNeil & Co as a representative covering the East Coast of the North Island. Appointed a director of Buxton's when his father died in 1901 Frederick developed broader interests for the firm now run with his brothers.\n\nWhen apples began to be grown for export Frederick offered growers financial help. He also successfully lobbied the government to offer apple exporters a guaranteed price and help with marketing arrangements in London.\n\nA district hop growers association was founded in 1918. Hamilton offered them his full co-operation and his enthusiasm and encouragement in the development of hop marketing led to his being appointed their managing agent.\n\nGerhard Husheer of the New Zealand Tobacco Company was persuaded by Hamilton to choose Nelson for tobacco-growing following a visit to the district in 1914.

Most of the business, financial, and diplomatic establishments are located in the area, which also forms the center of the city. The area is the main CBD of Jakarta, where most of the tallest skyscrapers are located. The area is bordered by main avenues of Jakarta, Thamrin Avenue-Sudirman Boulevard (North-Southwest), Rasuna Said Avenue (North-Southeast), and Gatot Subroto Avenue (East-West). There are many other roads criss-crossing the area.

Development axis of Jakarta was shifted towards south direction starting from Medan Merdeka to Kebayoran as the center of Jakarta in the 1950s, replacing that of Medan Merdeka-Senen-Salemba-Jatinegara axis which has grown since the 18th century.\n\nSome of the notable infrastructure projects of Sukarno during the first half of the 1960s were, construction of wide avenues like Jalan M.H.

Following implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the health plans must be integrated with a qualified employer-sponsored group health insurance plan to avoid excise tax penalties. Using a Health Reimbursement Arrangement yields \"tax advantages to offset health care costs\" for both employees and employers.\n\nHealth Reimbursement Accounts are funded solely by the employer; they cannot be funded through employee salary deductions. The employer sets the parameters for the Health Reimbursement Accounts, and unused dollars remain with the employer: they do not follow the employee to new employment.\n\nHealth Reimbursement Accounts are notional accounts; no funds are expensed until reimbursements are paid. By health reimbursement arrangements, employers reimburse employees directly only after the employees incur approved medical expenses. According to the IRS, an HRA \"must be funded solely by an employer. Contributions cannot be paid through a salary reduction agreement (such as a cafeteria plan). There is no minimum or maximum contribution limit on the employer's contributions to an HRA.\n\nAccording to the IRS, employees are reimbursed tax-free for qualified medical expenses up to a maximum amount for a coverage period. HRAs reimburse only items (co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, and services) agreed to by the employer that are not covered by the employer's selected standard insurance plan (any health insurance plan, not only a High Deductible Health Plan). The arrangements are described in IRC Section 105.\n\nWith an HRA, employers fund individual reimbursement accounts for their employees and define what those funds can be used for, specified out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays.\n\nQualified claims must be described in the HRA plan document at inception: before reimbursing employees for the medical expenses. Arrangements (medical services, dental services, co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, participation) may vary from plan to plan, and an employer may have multiple plans in place, allowing much flexibility. The kinds of expenses that can be paid under an HRA are generally the same as the expenses that can be paid through a Flexible Spending Account (FSA).\n\nThe employer is not required to prepay into a fund for reimbursements. Instead, the employer reimburses employee claims as they occur.\n\nReimbursements under an HRA can be made to the following persons:\n\nAdvantages of HRAs for employers include:\n\nAdvantages of HRAs for employees include:\n\nA frequent complaint regarding HRA arrangements is that they are extremely opaque in regards to their requirements. HRAs must follow \"a variety of statutory rules and provisions\" including the COBRA continuation coverage requirements, ERISA, and HIPAA.\n\nHRA plans are considered \"Primary Payers\" subject to Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) mandatory reporting requirements. There are significant penalties for failure to comply with the MSP reporting requirements. Although the MSP reporting requirements began to apply to certain group health plans on January 1, 2009, CMS has delayed mandatory reporting for HRAs.\n\nRules pertaining to their reimbursements are perceived by member participants to be somewhat contradictory and/or even incoherent, leading some to lose contributions intended for healthcare but later (after the procedure or laboratory test) to be disallowed.\n\nOther disadvantages of HRAs include:\n\nA sole proprietor can employ a spouse who actually helps the business. The employer would need to establish a W-2 to make the spouse's employment legitimate. The health care can be run through the business and save the family, on average, $3,000 each year. As small businesses look to reduce costs, especially medical, the HRA can be a great tool that has been used by all too few since the 1954 tax law.\n\nHRAs are treated as group health plans and subject to the Medicare secondary payment (MSP). HRAs are subject to the provisions regardless of whether or not they have an end-of-year carry-over feature.\n\nStandalone HRAs not offered in conjunction with a High Deductible Health Plan are subjected to restrictions starting in 2014. The law now essentially bans the existence of most such HRAs, as a health plan with maximum benefit limit.\n"}

He was also heir to the A&P supermarket fortune.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1922, Hartford became one of the heirs to the estate left by his grandfather and namesake, George Huntington Hartford. After graduating from Harvard University in 1934, he only briefly worked for A&P. For the rest of his life, Hartford focused on numerous other business and charitable enterprises. He owned Paradise Island in the Bahamas, and had numerous other business and real estate interests over his lifetime including the Oil Shale Corporation (TOSCO), which he founded in 1955.\n\nHartford was once known as one of the world's richest people. His final years were spent living in the Bahamas with his daughter, Juliet.\n\nHuntington Hartford was born in New York City, the son of Henrietta Guerard (Pollitzer) and Edward V. Hartford (1870–1922). He was named George Huntington Hartford II for his grandfather, George Huntington Hartford. His father and uncles, John Augustine Hartford and George Ludlum Hartford, privately owned the A&P Supermarket, which at one point had 16,000 stores in the U.S. and was the largest retail empire in the world. In the 1950s A&P was the world's largest grocer and, next to General Motors, it sold more goods than any other company in the world. \"Time\" magazine reported that A&P had sales of $2.7 billion in 1950. His maternal grandfather was from an Austrian Jewish family, and his maternal grandmother, who was Protestant, had deep roots in South Carolina. Hartford's father was a successful inventor and manufacturer who perfected the automotive shock absorber. Along with his brothers, Edward was also an heir to the A&P fortune and served as A&P's corporate secretary as well as one of three trustees that controlled A&P's stock.\n\nAfter Hartford's birth, the family moved to Deal, New Jersey, a wealthy community on the Atlantic shore. After Huntington's father died when he was 11, his mother moved the family to a mansion in Newport, Rhode Island known as \"Seaverge\" next to Rough Point, the mansion owned by tobacco heiress Doris Duke. The family also lived on a plantation in South Carolina called \"Wando\" as well as an apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\n\nAfter his father died in 1922, Hartford's mother sent him to St. Paul's School. He later majored in English literature at Harvard University. After his graduation from Harvard in 1934, he went to work at A&P headquarters in New York in the statistical department. He lived on a trust fund that generated about $1.5 million per year.\n\nOn 10 November 1936, he purchased from Alan Villiers the sailing ship Joseph Conrad which he converted to a private yacht, and donated to the U.S. Maritime Commission as a sail training ship in 1939.\n\nIn 1940, Hartford invested $100,000 to help start a newspaper, \"PM\", with Marshall Field III and worked as a reporter for the publication. An avid sailor, he donated his yacht to the Coast Guard at the start of World War II. During the war he was commissioned in the Coast Guard and commanded the Army supply ship \"FS-179\", commissioned in May 1944, in the Pacific Theater. Hartford twice accidentally ran the ship aground.\n\nAfter the war, he moved to Los Angeles and attempted to purchase Republic Pictures and RKO Studios from Howard Hughes. Huntington also started a modeling agency and an artists' colony, and opened a theater.\n\nIn the 1950s, Hartford purchased a penthouse duplex on the 13th and 14th floors of One Beekman Place in the 1950s after moving from an apartment at the River House in New York City. He owned a home called \"Pompano\" on 240 El Vedado Drive in Palm Beach, a estate in Mahwah, New Jersey called \"Melody Farm\", a Hollywood estate known as \"The Pines\" (also known as Runyon Canyon Park), a townhouse in London, a home in Juan-les-Pins France and a house on Paradise Island in the Bahamas.\n\nHartford owned Huntington Hartford Productions which produced several films including the Abbott and Costello film, \"Africa Screams\", in 1949. In 1950, Hartford produced \"Hello Out There\", the last film of James Whale, the acclaimed director of the 1931 version of \"Frankenstein\". He produced several films starring Marjorie Steele and encouraged her to become an artist.\n\nIn 1955, Hartford founded the Oil Shale Corporation, later known as Tosco, and was its majority shareholder and chairman. Tosco was later acquired by ConocoPhillips. He also set up the Denver Research Institute at the University of Denver to find alternate methods of oil extraction. During this period, he also wrote and produced \"The Master of Thornfield\", a stage adaptation of \"Jane Eyre\" that ran for two weeks in Cincinnati starring Errol Flynn as Mr. Rochester. This partnership led to Flynn staying in Hartford's pool-house briefly in 1957–58 and is the origin of a legend that \"The Pines\" was Flynn's estate. Later, Hartford produced the play on Broadway. In 1964, Hartford offered The Pines as a gift to the city but was turned down by Mayor Sam Yorty. As Lloyd Wright recalled in 1977, \"Here was this very wealthy man, and he wanted to give something very stunning to Hollywood. The Chambers of Commerce, the hotel owners and the various businesses were jealous of the park and with the help of the city officials, the city refused to give us permits. Hunt was so angry that he wanted to get out immediately and sold the property to [Jules] Berman who destroyed the mansion and let the place run down.\"\n\nWhen his uncle George Ludlum Hartford died in 1957, the trust set up by the elder George Huntington Hartford was liquidated and Hartford inherited his portion of the estate. The \"Chicago Tribune\" estimated his wealth in 1969 as half a billion dollars. In 1959, Mike Wallace introduced him on television interview as being worth half a billion dollars.\n\nIn 1959, Hartford bought Hog Island in the Bahamas, renaming it Paradise Island. He developed it over the next three years hoping to turn it into another Monte Carlo. One feature of his Ocean Club was a cloister built from the disassembled stones of a monastery that William Randolph Hearst had stored in a Florida warehouse. In an interview with David Frost on British television, Hartford stated that the flag he created for Paradise Island was in the shape of a \"P\" and that he wanted to put it on the moon as a symbol of peace for the world. Hartford was responsible for getting the gambling license for Paradise Island by hiring Sir Stafford Sands, a Bahamian lawyer.\n\nIn 1969, Hartford produced the Broadway show \"Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?\", which opened at the Belasco Theater starring the then-unknown actor Al Pacino. Pacino won a Tony for his performance.\n\nHartford was a patron of the arts, building an artists colony above Los Angeles and later a gallery in New York City, and his opinions on the arts were equally strong. He criticized Abstract Expressionists, believing they had ushered in a great \"ice age of art,\" freezing out the grand traditions of music, painting and sculpture; he described Pablo Picasso as a \"mountebank\". Beyond expressionism, he derided the \"beatnik, the Existentialist, the juvenile delinquent, the zaniest of abstract art, the weirdest aberrations of the mentally unbalanced, the do-nothing philosophy of Zen Buddhism\" as a result of wanton \"abuse of liberty and freedom.\" He had strong opinions against the work of Tennessee Williams, T. S. Eliot, and Willem de Kooning, as well as art dealer Sidney Janis.\n\nTo support the art that he enjoyed, Hartford built an artists' colony in Rustic Canyon, above the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. Buying more than 150 acres in 1948, he hired Lloyd Wright (son of Frank Lloyd Wright) to adapt existing structures and design new ones. When it opened in 1951, it had more than a dozen cottages and a central dining room for distinguished artists, composers and craftspeople who won scholarships for one to six-month retreats. For nearly 15 years, more than 400 colony artists generated international success with exhibitions, concerts, theater performances and Pulitzer Prizes; included among them were composers Ernst Toch and Ruth Shaw Wylie, writer and activist Max Eastman, and painter Edward Hopper.\n\nHartford also renovated and opened a theater which he renamed the Huntington Hartford Theater, which opened in 1954. For ten years the Hartford Theater was Los Angeles's premier venue for Broadway-scale productions featuring the stars of the time.\n\nHartford's taste for Los Angeles began to wane, however, after the Los Angeles County Museum of Art rejected an exhibition he proposed. He decided to build his own museum in New York City, the 1964 Gallery of Modern Art on New York's Columbus Circle, declaring that building a museum in Los Angeles was like putting up \"a theater in Oklahoma\" due to a lack of audience. With the financial commitment to a new museum in New York and tiring of his art colony, he asked local government officials and wealthy patrons to contribute to the colony's support. Lacking what he felt would be sufficient commitment, he shut down the colony in 1965 (he had sold the Huntington Hartford Theater in 1964).\n\nHartford owned an extensive art collection. In an interview by Edward R. Murrow on his show \"Person to Person\" he gave a tour of the collection at his Beekman Place apartment including Rembrandt's \"Portrait of a man, half-length, with his arms akimbo\", which sold at Christie's auction house in London on December 8, 2009 for $33 million, a world record for a Rembrandt.\n\nTo house his extensive collection of 19th- and 20th-century art, Hartford built the Gallery of Modern Art at 2 Columbus Circle in Manhattan which opened in 1964. Pointedly, it did not include Abstract Expressionism which Hartford panned in his book, \"Art or Anarchy\". Hartford was a patron of the architect Edward Durell Stone who designed the modernist marble-clad structure often derided as the \"lollipop building\". Stone had previously designed the Museum of Modern Art for the Rockefeller family. Hartford commissioned Salvador Dalí to paint The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus for the museum's opening. The museum also included Hartford's paintings by Monet, Manet, Degas, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Hartford closed the museum after five years. Later the building housed the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and was recently rebuilt with a new facade to house the Museum of Arts and Design.\n\nHartford was married four times, all ending in divorce, and had five children. His mother intended Huntington to marry Doris Duke, but in April 1931, Huntington married Mary Lee Epling, the 18-year-old daughter of a dentist from Covington, West Virginia. They divorced in 1939. In 1938, Huntington had a son, Edward \"Buzzy\" Barton, with dancer Mary Barton. Hartford supported the boy financially but refused to legally acknowledge him as his son. In 1967, Edward Barton died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nHuntington's second wife was Marjorie Steele, an aspiring actress whom Hartford married in 1949. The couple had two children, Catherine (born 1950) and John Hartford (born 1958). The couple divorced in 1960. Catherine Hartford died of a drug overdose in June 1988. John Hartford later became a musician and music teacher. He died of throat cancer on April 15, 2011.\n\nIn 1962, Hartford married Diane Brown at Melody Farm in Mahwah, New Jersey. They had a daughter, Cynara Juliet, before divorcing in 1970. Five years later, he married Elaine Kay but was divorced again in 1981.\n\nIn February 2004, he and his daughter moved to Lyford Cay in the Bahamas.\n\nHartford died at his home in Lyford Cay on May 19, 2008 at the age of 97. The cause of his death was publicly released. His remains are interred at Lakeview Memorial Gardens & Mausoleums in Nassau.\n\n\n"}

Completed in 1979 at a cost of $57 million as a replacement for the Detroit Olympia, it sits adjacent to Cobo Center on the bank of the Detroit River and is accessible by the Joe Louis Arena station on the Detroit People Mover. The venue is named after former heavyweight champion boxer Joe Louis, who grew up in Detroit.\n\nIt was the home of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League and the second oldest NHL venue after Madison Square Garden until the start of the 2017–18 NHL season. Joe Louis Arena is owned by the city of Detroit, and operated by Olympia Entertainment, a subsidiary of team owner Ilitch Holdings.\n\nIn April 2017, the Red Wings hosted their final game at Joe Louis Arena; the venue was succeeded by the new Little Caesars Arena, in Midtown Detroit, beginning with the 2017–18 season. Joe Louis Arena will be demolished, and its site slated for redevelopment. The arena closed on July 30, 2017. Demolition was scheduled to begin in September 2017, but Olympia renewed the lease of the arena with the city and are using it as storage and offices until November 2017. Olympia Entertainment moved out in November 2017, and demolition is planned to begin sometime in 2019.\n\nJoe Louis Arena replaced the Olympia Stadium, where the Detroit Red Wings had played since 1927. The neighborhood around the Olympia had gradually deteriorated, especially after the 1967 Detroit riot. After two murders near the Olympia, Red Wings owner Bruce Norris seriously considered moving to a proposed arena in suburban Pontiac. However, the city of Detroit countered with a proposal for a new riverfront arena at one-third of the rent Pontiac was offering. The package also gave the Red Wings operational control of the arena, nearby Cobo Arena and nearby lots.\n\nThe arena hosted its first event on December 12, 1979: a college basketball game between the University of Michigan and the University of Detroit. The Red Wings played their first game at Joe Louis Arena on December 27, 1979, hosting the St. Louis Blues. The game ended in a 3-2 loss for the Red Wings. The Red Wings first win at the arena came on December 30, 1979, where they defeated the New York Islanders 4-2. Later that first season it hosted the 32nd NHL All-Star Game on February 5, 1980, which was played before a then-NHL record crowd of 21,002. Joe Louis Arena was the site of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, which marked the first NHL Entry Draft to be held in the United States. In 1980, the arena hosted the Republican National Convention that nominated Ronald Reagan as the Republican candidate for President of the United States.\nIn 1990, color matrix boards were installed on the scoreboard; these were replaced by four Sony JumboTron video walls three years later, when the matrix boards were placed in the corners of the fascia. In 2006, LED video screens replaced the JumboTrons. The screens debuted November 22, 2006, when the Red Wings played the Vancouver Canucks. That same day, the arena's West Entrance was named the \"Gordie Howe Entrance\" in honor of the legendary Red Wing player, and a bronze statue of Howe was placed inside the entrance. Joe Louis Arena houses 86 premium suites. In 2008, the arena introduced the Comerica Bank Legend's Club, a 181-person private seating location in the arena's southeast corner.\n\nOn July 20, 2014, following the July 2013 approval of a $650 million project to build a new sports and entertainment district in Downtown Detroit, Christopher Ilitch unveiled designs for a new arena near Comerica Park and Ford Field which was completed in 2017 and succeeded Joe Louis Arena as the home of the Red Wings. On October 16, 2014, lawyers involved in the ongoing Detroit bankruptcy case disclosed in court that after demolition (which will be paid for by the city and state), the land on which the arena stands, along with an adjacent parking lot, will be transferred to the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), a bond insurer with a $1 billion claim against the city.\n\nThe Red Wings' final game at Joe Louis Arena was played on April 9, 2017 against the New Jersey Devils. The Red Wings won 4–1, the final goal in the arena's history coming from Red Wing Riley Sheahan. It was the second of two he scored, which were also the only goals he scored at all during the 2016–17 season.\nThe last ticketed event held at The Joe was a WWE Live Event, held on July 29, 2017. The arena will be demolished and replaced with new development at the site in 2019.\n\nIn 1995, the Detroit Junior Red Wings won the Ontario Hockey League's J. Ross Robertson Cup, defeating the Guelph Storm.\n\nJoe Louis Arena hosted college hockey events as part of College Hockey at The Joe, the Great Lakes Invitational, and the Big Ten Conference hockey tournament in 2015 and 2017.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons of the NBA used the arena for Game 5 of their 1984 playoff series against the New York Knicks when the Pontiac Silverdome was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict. In the game, Pistons star Isiah Thomas scored 16 points in the final 1:34 of regulation to send the game into overtime before the Pistons lost. The Pistons were forced to return to Joe Louis Arena for 15 games during the 1984–85 season, after the roof of the Silverdome collapsed during a snowstorm.\n\nThe National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings hosted the Stanley Cup Finals at the arena six times (1995, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2008, and 2009), and won two of their Stanley Cup championships at Joe Louis Arena in 1997 and 2002. The 1998 Stanley Cup championship was won in Washington, D.C.'s MCI Center and the 2008 championship was won in Pittsburgh's Mellon Arena. The Red Wings lost in the Finals to New Jersey in 1995 at the Meadowlands Arena and lost on home ice in the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals to Pittsburgh.\n\nJoe Louis Arena was the site of the decisive Game 5 of the 2006 WNBA Finals between the Sacramento Monarchs and Detroit Shock on September 9, due to The Palace of Auburn Hills (the Shock's usual home arena) being used for a Mariah Carey concert on the same day. The Shock won the game 80–75 to clinch the championship.\n\nFormer Arena Football League team the Detroit Drive also had success during their time at the arena, playing in six consecutive ArenaBowls from 1988 to 1993 and winning four of them. Four of the games (ArenaBowl III, ArenaBowl IV, ArenaBowl V and ArenaBowl VII) were played in Joe Louis Arena.\n\nJoe Louis Arena was the site of the 2013 edition of the Skate America figure skating competition. In addition, Joe Louis Arena hosted the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, best known for the pre-competition attack on Nancy Kerrigan by associates of Tonya Harding.\n\nIt was announced on May 7, 2015, that the Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament would be held in Detroit beginning in 2016 under a five-year deal; the 2016 and 2017 tournaments were held at Joe Louis Arena.\n\nJoe Louis Arena was also a concert venue. Until the Palace of Auburn Hills was built in 1988, Joe Louis Arena was Michigan's largest indoor arena for concerts. The first concert to take place there occurred on February 17, 1980, in which Max Webster opened for the Canadian rock group Rush To compensate for most of Joe Louis Arena's concert business being moved north following the opening of the Palace, the Red Wings began a tradition of playing a home game on New Year's Eve. Aside from lockouts cancelling part or all of the 1994–95, 2004–05, and 2012–13 seasons, the Red Wings left the New Year's Eve date open in years they were scheduled to participate in the NHL Winter Classic. For New Year's Eve 2012 and 2013, the Zac Brown Band held concerts at the Joe. The 2012 date was open due to the planned 2013 Winter Classic that was postponed by lockout until 2014.\n\n"}

He studied law in Paris and became involved with commerce at an early age, importing Russian wheat to London and Marseilles. From these activities he amassed a large fortune.\n\nIn 1874, Melas settled permanently in Athens, where he soon achieved a distinguished place among Athenian high society. He played a crucial role in the foundation of the Athens Club in 1875, the Greek capital's oldest and most exclusive gentlemen's club, and served as its president in 1882–1886 and 1888–1897. In 1890, he was elected to the Greek Parliament for Attica. He became mayor of Athens in 1891, holding the office until 1894, after an unsuccessful first attempt in 1883, when he lost to Dimitrios Soutsos.

Santiago is a Democrat representing the 53rd Assembly District, which encompasses parts of Downtown Los Angeles and East Los Angeles.\n\nSantiago is a member of the California Latino Legislative Caucus. Prior to being elected to the Assembly in 2014, he was a member of the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees. He also served as District Director to former Assembly Speaker John Pérez.\n\nSantiago co-authored S.B. 822 alongside Senator Scott Wiener, legislation that would strengthen net neutrality protections in California. Hours after being signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown, a Motion for Preliminary Injunction was filed by the Department of Justice. Both parties have agreed to wait until a separate court case in the D.C. Circuit Court is decided before moving on. As part of the agreement, the law is not currently being enforced and the injunction was withdrawn. \n\nAfter passing the California Senate, S.B. 822 was amended by Miguel Santiago in June 2018. SB-822 would restore Obama-era rules that the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission rolled back in December, 2017. Santiago's amendments removed all provisions of the bill's net neutrality protections that were not in the text of the 2015 Open Internet Order, leaving in only those that were in the two-pages of rules. This prompted the bill's original sponsor, Senator Scott Wiener, to pull his support for his own bill and declare that it had been \"hijacked\" and that he was \"not interested in passing a bill that is watered down so severely.\" The changes also included deleting a large section of definitions, which critics claim could make it more difficult for California's attorney general to prosecute violations of the legislation. \n\nThe amendments, published less than 12 hours before the hearing, were approved 8-0[6] by the Communications and Conveyance committee, which Santiago chairs, on June 20, 2018. That vote occurred before Wiener could argue against them and before any testimony. After the testimony, the amended bill was approved 8-2. Opponents of the amended version stated that Santiago's changes would create loopholes through which broadband providers could charge fees to content providers while exempting their own content from any data caps. Proponents of the changes contend that without them broadband providers would not be allowed to offer free mobile data that doesn't count against users' caps, harming consumers, and that net neutrality in general would discourage providers from improving their network infrastructure. Representatives of major ISPs continue to oppose the bill, even in its amended form. \n\nState Assemblyman Miguel Santiago has received over $60,000 from telecom lobbyists, with AT&T and Comcast being the top telecom contributors, over the course of his assembly career. However, Wiener said that despite the \"strenuous disagreement here, [...] it’s not about campaign contributions\" and that the telecoms \"spent a lot of money in California targeting members with Twitter and Facebook ads, doing robo-calls to seniors telling them their bills are going to go up, that this bill is going to make your monthly payment go up. They flooded the capitol with lobbyists.\"\n\nOn June 6, 2018, Santiago released a press statement saying that his amendments were intended to help \"deliver a bill that could withstand legal challenges from the telecommunications industry\" and that \"we ran out of time\" to reach an agreement with Wiener. Knowing Wiener would not support the changes, the committee \"took action to insert amendments without his consent to keep the bill moving.\" Santiago expressed regret at the \"legislative maneuverings\" required to advance the bill and that he does not \"envision policy being created in this manner.\" The public response was intense, and Santiago stated that his family had received threats and that offensive memes smearing his wife and children had been shared online. \n\n"}

{"id": "9525663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9525663", "title": "Overhead (business)", "text": "Overhead (business)\n\nIn business, overhead or overhead expense refers to an ongoing expense of operating a business. Overheads are the expenditure which cannot be conveniently traced to or identified with any particular cost unit, unlike operating expenses such as raw material and labor. Therefore, overheads cannot be immediately associated with the products or services being offered, thus do not directly generate profits. However, overheads are still vital to business operations as they provide critical support for the business to carry out profit making activities. For example, overhead costs such as the rent for a factory allows workers to manufacture products which can then be sold for a profit. Such expenses are incurred for output generally and not for particular work order; e.g., wages paid to watch and ward staff, heating and lighting expenses of factory, etc. Overheads are also very important cost element along with direct materials and direct labor.\n\nOverheads are often related to accounting concepts such as fixed costs and indirect costs.\n\nOverhead expenses are all costs on the income statement except for direct labor, direct materials, and direct expenses. Overhead expenses include accounting fees, advertising, insurance, interest, legal fees, labor burden, rent, repairs, supplies, taxes, telephone bills, travel expenditures, and utilities.\n\nThere are essentially two types of business overheads: administrative overheads and manufacturing overheads.\n\nAdministrative overheads include items such as utilities, strategic planning, and various supporting functions. These costs are treated as overheads due to the fact that they aren't directly related to any particular function of the organization nor does it directly result in generating any profits. Instead, these costs simply take on the role of supporting all of the business' other functions.\n\nUniversities regularly charge administrative overhead rates on research. In the U.S. the average overhead rate is 52%, which is spent on building operation, administrative salaries and other areas not directly tied to research. Academics have argued against these charges. For example, Benjamin Ginsberg showed how overhead rates are primarily used to subsidize ballooning administrative salaries and building depreciation, neither of which directly benefit research; although it does benefit the administrators that determine university policy in his book The Fall of Faculty. An article written by Joshua Pearce in Science argued that overhead accounting practices hurt science by removing funds from research and discouraging the use of less-expensive open source hardware. He went into detail on the accounting showing how millions were wasted each year on overhead cash grabs by university administrators in ZME Science.\n\nThis includes mainly monthly and annual salaries that are agreed upon. They are considered overheads as these costs must be paid regardless of sales and profits of the company. In addition, salary differs from wage as salary is not affected by working hours and time, therefore will remain constant. In particular, this would more commonly apply to more senior staff members as they are typically signed to longer tenure contracts, meaning that their salaries are more commonly predetermined.\n\nThis includes office equipment such as printer, fax machine, computers, refrigerator, etc. They are equipment that do not directly result in sales and profits as they are only used for supporting functions that they can provide to business operations. However, equipment can vary between administrative overheads and manufacturing overheads based on the purpose of which they are using the equipment. For example, for a printing company a printer would be considered a manufacturing overhead.\n\nThis includes the cost of hiring external law and audit firms on behalf of the company. This would not apply if company has own internal lawyers and audit plans. Due to regulations and necessary annual audits to ensure a satisfactory work place environment, these costs often cannot be avoided. Also, since these costs do not necessarily contribute directly to sales, they are considered as indirect overheads. Although in most cases necessary, these costs can sometimes be avoided and reduced.\n\nMany companies provide usage of company cars as a perk for their employees. Since these cars do not contribute directly to sales and profits, they are considered an overhead. Similar company perks that are a one-off or constant payment such as partner contract fees with a gym will also fall under administrative overheads.\n\nThis will include company-paid business travels and arrangements. As well as refreshments, meals, and entertainment fees during company gatherings. Although one might argue that these costs motivate workers to become more productive and efficient, the majority of economists agree that these costs do not directly contribute to sales and profits, therefore shall be categorized as an administrative overhead. Despite these costs occurring periodically and sometimes without prior preparation, they are usually one-off payments and are expected to be within the company's budget for travel and entertainment.\n\nManufacturing overheads are all costs endured by a business that is within the physical platform in which the product or service is created. Difference between manufacturing overheads and administrative overheads is that manufacturing overheads are categorized within a factory or office in which the sale takes place. Whilst administrative overheads is typically categorized within some sort of back-office or supporting office. Although there are cases when the two physical buildings may overlap, it is the usage of the overheads that separates them.\n\nAlthough the general concept is identical to the example under administrative overheads, the key difference is the role of the employee. In the case of manufacturing overheads, employees would have roles such as maintenance personnel, manufacturing managers, materials management staff, and quality control staff. It would also include the set wages for janitorial staff members. Once again, the key difference lies in the nature of their respective jobs and the physical location in which their jobs are carried out.\n\nThis refers to the reduction in value of equipments as it becomes older and more obsolete. For example, if a printer has a potential useful life span of 5 years, the amount that it can be sold for will decrease each year. Therefore, this value in depreciation is calculated as a manufacturing overhead. Moreover, this also applies to vehicles as they tend to depreciate in value significantly after the first year. When calculating manufacturing overheads, accountants mainly use two methods: straight-line method and declining balance method.\n\nEvery single property unless government owned is subject to some form of property tax. Therefore, the taxes on production factories are categorized as manufacturing overheads as they are costs which cannot be avoided nor cancelled. In addition, property taxes do not change in relation to the business's profits or sales and will likely remain the same unless a change by the government administration.\nUnless the business decides to purchase land and build its own factory, it will be subject to some sort of rent due to the amount of capital required to build a privately owned factory. Therefore, this rent must be paid to the landlord on a regular basis regardless of the performance of the business. Although the rent for the building provides the physical platform for the company to produce its products and services, it is not a direct contributor.\n\nThis would vary depending on how the utility bill is structured. In the case of it being an overhead, the utility bill is pre-negotiated meaning that the monthly utility bill will be the same regardless of the amount in which the factory actually consumes. This will only be relevant in various countries where there is an option for standardized utility bills. However, due to the vast consumption of electricity, gas, and water in most factories, most companies tend to not have standardized utility bills as it tends to be more expensive. Standardized utility bills are also oftentimes discouraged by governments as it leads to wastage of resources and negative externalities of production.\n\nFor most businesses, business overheads are calculated by accountants for budgeting purposes but also often so the business has an idea of how much they must charge consumers in order to make a profit. The following are common accounting tools which take account of business overheads.\nThe break-even analysis determines the point which the business's revenue is equivalent to the costs required to receive that revenue. It first calculates a margin of safety (the point which the revenue exceeds the break-even point) as that is the \"safe\" amount which the revenue can fall whilst still remaining to be above the break-even point. The graph on the right shows a typical break-even chart. Contribution refers to sales of the product or service, it can also be interpreted as the business's revenue stream. Fixed costs in this case serves the same purpose as business overheads, it will simply be shown as a straight horizontal line on the graph as shown.\n\nIn economics, revenue curves are often illustrated to show whether or not a business should stay in business, or shut down. In theory, if a business is able cover variable operational costs but unable to cover business overheads in the short run, the business should remain in business. On the other hand, if the business is not even able to cover operational costs, it should shut down. Although this rule largely differs depending on the size of the business, the business's cash-flow, and the competitive nature of the business, it serves as a model rule for most small competitive businesses to operate on.\n\nBalance sheet is a financial statement which outlines a company's financial assets, liabilities, and shareholder's equity at a specific time. Both assets and liabilities are separated into two categories depending on their time frame; current and long-term. Business overheads in particular fall under current liabilities as they are costs for which the company must pay on a relatively short-term/immediate basis. Although the balance sheet by itself does not offer much information, it is a useful piece of financial information when combined with other documents such as the income statement or ratio analysis as it offers a diverse and well-rounded description of the company's financial position.\n\n"}

At the time of its construction, it was the tallest building in the state of Florida and was the defining landmark in Jacksonville's skyline. On April 18, 2012, the American Institute of Architects's Florida Chapter placed the building on its list of \"Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places\" as the Riverplace Tower / Formerly Gulf Life Tower.\n\nThe Auchter Company, Jacksonville's oldest general construction contractor, built the 542,000 ft Gulf Life Tower for the Gulf Life Insurance Company in 1966. It was designed by the notable architect, Welton Becket and KBJ Architects. When completed in 1967, it was the tallest precast, post-tensioned concrete structure in the world.\n\nIt remained Florida's tallest for five years until Miami's One Biscayne Tower was constructed in 1972. \nIt was Jacksonville's tallest for eight years until the Independent Life Building (now the Wells Fargo Center) was built in 1974. In 2007, 40 years after its construction, Riverplace Tower was still the fifth tallest building in Jacksonville.\n\nGulf Life Insurance Company was merged into American General Life of Houston in 1991 and the Jacksonville Gulf Life Tower was unneeded and destined to be sold. American General wanted $30 million, but the building was 24 years old and no longer a class \"A\" property. Several prospective buyers looked at the building, but the property stayed on the market for more than two years. For tax reasons, American General was desperate to sell during 1993 and accepted a cash offer from Gate Petroleum for substantially less than their asking price. Shortly thereafter, Gate began a multimillion-dollar renovation of the entire building and renamed it \"Riverplace Tower\".\n\nBuilding occupancy was 40% when the sale closed; within two years from the completion of the renovation, it had soared to nearly 95% and the building was restored to its former prominence.\n\nThe banner sign at the top of the building originally displayed \"Gulf Life\" in 1967. After Gulf Life was acquired by American General in 1991, it was changed to \"SouthTrust\", and the structure was known as the \"SouthTrust Building\". When SouthTrust and Wachovia merged in 2005, \"Wachovia\" signage was installed, but it was removed January 22, 2011.\n\nSince 1968, the University Club of Jacksonville has occupied the building's top floor. The private club is available members and their guests, or ClubCorp affiliates. There are approximately 1,300 members: business executives of both genders; older, long-term associates; and young professionals. The facility is a hub for networking and entertaining clients, as well as providing conference rooms and offices for conducting business in private. The club also offers two full service athletic facilities; one co-ed and one for men only.\n\nThe structural system consists of precast concrete floorplates and a poured concrete core. The concrete grid on the outside of the building is the only support needed to hold up the structure, leaving the interior completely available for use. Each of the exposed beams consist of fourteen precast units held together with high strength post-tensioned steel cables. The beams cantilever 42 feet from the columns as they taper upward and inward. The color of the concrete façade comes from White quartz sand and white cement bonded to the surface.\n\nThe Gate River Run \"Hall of Fame\" was established in 2002 and is permanently located on the concourse level. Memorabilia from the event, which began in 1978, is on display, and a five-minute video gives visitors an overview of the race. Plaques for each of the 12 persons inducted into the HOF are on display.\n\nThe Southbank Grille is a public restaurant located on the second floor of the tower, and it offers an excellent view of the river and northbank through its glass, north-facing wall.\n\nIn honor of its 50th anniversary, the \"Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute\" went through the arduous process of selecting the Seven precast concrete \"Wonders\". Their choices were: the Department of Housing & Urban Development Headquarters in Washington, D.C.; Gulf Life Tower in Jacksonville, Fla.; Disney World Monorail in Orlando, Fla.; TransAmerica Pyramid in San Francisco, Calif.; Aurora Justice Facility and Municipal Center in Aurora, Colo.; Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay, Fla.; and the Blue Cross-Blue Shield Parking Structure in North Haven, Conn.\n\nAccording to an Architecture article in \"Time Magazine\", \"(the) Gulf Life, placed in a shoddy, chaotic part of Jacksonville, is a tonic for its area, acts as an organizing beacon. And the bold Alcoa building…makes a positive contribution to San Francisco. Both buildings thus achieve excellence.\" \n\n\n"}

{"id": "46792382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46792382", "title": "The HTML500", "text": "The HTML500\n\nThe HTML500 is a multi-city Canadian technology conference that teaches 500 attendees per event the basics of HTML and CSS programming. Its goal is to promote web development and web programming literacy among Canadian youth, and open the doors for those who may be interested in pursuing careers in technology. Its annual events are held in four Canadian cities: Vancouver, Toronto, London, and Calgary. Event sponsors include IBM, Telus (a Canadian telecom giant), the British Columbia Government's Innovation Council, and Microsoft.\n\nThe HTML500 is Canada's largest educational technology event, having taught thousands of Canadians how to code since its inception.\n\nThe HTML500 was founded in 2013 by Canadian entrepreneurs Khurram Virani and Jeremy Shaki. Virani and Shaki are the co-founders of Lighthouse Labs, the largest Canadian web developer Coding Bootcamp . Lighthouse Labs acts as the official sponsor and parent company of the conferences. In an interview with BetaKit, Shaki said of the educational initiative, \"It’s about more people in Canada understanding the value of digital literacy. It’s about trying to get our governments and other major Canadian institutions involved in the conversation.\"\n\nIn 2014, the event expanded to three additional Canadian cities: Calgary, Toronto, and London.\n\nThe second annual event in Vancouver had over 2500 applicants, of which the official 500 were selected through a lottery process. Over half of the attendees were women. Beginning with the second Vancouver event, the Vancouver Economic Commission began running a career fair in tandem with the day's activities to further provide career resources to aspiring web developers.\n\nThe multi-city events are routinely covered on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television network.\n\nEach event is designed to host 500 attendees. In each city, 50 local technology companies are chosen to help participate by managing and providing teaching assistance at one of the event's 50 attendee roundtables. All the partners and local community members who participate in the event donate their time voluntarily, as the event is a not-for-profit, and there is no entry charge.\n\nEach event begins with a keynote speech plus an educational crash course taught by a notable member of the Canadian technology industry. Attendees are then provided with reference materials to assist them in the second phase of the schedule: building a website from scratch. By the end of the seven-hour schedule, it is the conference's goal to have removed the attendees' intimidation associated with programming, and to give them the confidence and resources needed to continue their web development learning if they choose to do so.\n\n"}

It was built in 1959 and stands at 14 floors in height and was completely remodeled in 2011. It was designed in the modern architectural style, and uses a great deal of marble to coordinate with the buildings in the nearby Civic Center. It was designed by Albert Kahn Associates.\n\nThe Qube stands on the site of Detroit's first skyscraper, the Hammond Building. The ground floor of this building is a massive 1.5-story glass sheathed, banking hall. The building was known as 'Chase Tower' from 2006 to 2011 to reflect Chase Bank's buyout of Bank One. In March 2007, the Sterling Group purchased the tower from JP Morgan Chase. Occupancy was approximately 50 percent at the time of sale. The building has had 3 official names now, for each of the 3 successive banks that have owned it: National Bank of Detroit (NBD), succeeded by Bank One, and lastly Chase.\nThe building has gone by several names in the past, most notably: Bank One Center, National Bank of Detroit Building, Bank One Building and Chase Tower.\n\nIn April 2011, Quicken Loans bought the building, renamed it the Qube and relocated 4,000 of the company's employees to the facility. The company plans to fill remaining space with retail.\n\nIn August 2014, the Detroit bureau of Southfield-based ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV moved into the Qube after spending several decades across from the headquarters of the Detroit Police Department; its new location now includes satellite studio and newsroom facilities.\n\nThe building is located on the block bordered by Woodward Avenue to the east, with the First National Building across Woodward. West Fort Street borders the building on the north, with Cadillac Square and 1001 Woodward across the street.
