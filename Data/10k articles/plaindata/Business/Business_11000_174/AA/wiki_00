Its grand skylighted hall, based on French retail structures, cast daylight into the lower floors. Its architect was George B. Post, who built it from 1881–84. \n\nThe Produce Exchange Building was demolished in 1957 and replaced by a 32-story tower constructed in 1958-1959. The developer, Uris Buildings Corporation, first preferred a design by William Lescaze with Kahn & Jacobs, which featured a tower slab set at right angles to Broadway. However, ultimately Emery Roth & Sons was given the contract, which saw a radically different design which would fill most of the lot, with the building rising in triple setbacks. The facade is now covered in blue-green tinted glass.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was vacating its headquarters at 370 Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The MTA rented space in 2 Broadway where it moved some of its operations. In 1995, Tamir Sapir, a Russian immigrant and cab driver turned real-estate investor, bought 2 Broadway for $20 million, with the MTA as the only tenant in the building. The MTA signed a 49-year lease in July 1998, shortly after selling its New York Coliseum. Shortly after, Sapir and the MTA agreed to conduct $39 million worth of renovations to 2 Broadway. However, the renovations had become delayed and over budget, and Sapir and the MTA became involved in numerous lawsuits and countersuits. By 2000, the renovations were expected to cost $135 million. By 2003, the cost of the renovations had risen to $435 million. Part of the budget increase was attributed to corruption by contractors who were renovating the buildings. One such contractor was later ordered to pay restitution to the MTA for corruption.\n\n\n"}

These standards are published each year in the \"AATCC Technical Manual\". All standards are developed and updated by volunteer members, through research committees. All industry stakeholders may participate in the standards-development process.\n\nBefore a standard is published in the \"AATCC Technical Manual\", it must be unanimously approved by voting members of the responsible research committee and the Technical Committee on Research (TCR). During the first three years, each new standard is reviewed annually, at which time, on recommendation of the research committee and approval by TCR, it may be reaffirmed, revised, or withdrawn. After the first three years, each standard is reviewed at least every five years. The content of many AATCC methods form the basis of equivalent ISO methods.\n\nAATCC serves as secretary for the US Technical Advisory Committee (TAG) to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) textile test method development. (For many years, AATCC was also secretary of ISO TC38 SC1 and SC2.)\n\nAATCC provides test method training at its laboratories, at members’ facilities, online, and in more than 10 countries around the globe. AATCC also offers test method proficiency programs and quality control products for use in conducting its test methods.\n\nAATCC publishes a bi-monthly magazine, \"AATCC Review\", containing technical articles, feature articles, and news for textile professionals. The Association also publishes the \"AATCC Journal of Research\", a bi-monthly online peer-reviewed research journal with a broad scope. The \"AATCC News\", a newsletter published twice per month, is distributed by e-mail. Other publications include a website, \"AATCC Blog\", books, and training videos.\n\nThe association conducts educational programs, such as workshops, seminars, conferences, webinars, and online instruction, on various aspects of textiles. Proficiency programs are available for labs to participate in.\n\nEach year, AATCC honors outstanding members and the greater textile community with many awards, including the Olney Medal for outstanding achievement in textile chemistry. The Millson Award for Invention recognizes outstanding contributions to textile technology, the Harold C. Chapin Award is presented for exemplary service to AATCC, and the J. William Weaver Paper of the Year Award goes to the authors of the best peer-reviewed manuscript published in \"AATCC Journal of Research\" during the year. Students are eligible to participate and compete in several awards and competitions, including the C2C Student Design Competition, C2C Student Merchandising Competition, Herman & Myrtle Goldstein Student Paper Competition, Student Chapter Awards, and Outstanding College Graduate of the Year Award. AATCC Foundation Inc., a 501(c)(3) public charitable organization, was established in 1997 and operates independently in the furtherance of the charitable mission of the association by providing scholarships and research grants to undergraduate and graduate students studying textiles and related fields.\n\nAATCC works in collaboration with other textile associations around the world, including the Textile Institute (UK), Federación Latinoamericana de Químicos y Profesionales Textiles (FLAQT) (Latin American Federation of Textile Chemical Professional Associations), La Asociación Argentina de Químicos y Coloristas Textiles (Argentina), the China Textile Information Center (China), and the Associação Brasileira de Químicos e Coloristas Têxteis (Brazil). In addition, AATCC works with ASTM International, INDA (the Nonwovens Association), the Specialty Graphics Imaging Association (SGIA), the Synthetic Yarn and Fiber Association (SYFA), Industrial Fabrics Association International (IFAI), Inter-Society Color Council (ISCC), the National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO), TAPPI, [TC], the Textile Exchange, and the Nonwovens Institute. Together with its counterpart in the United Kingdom, the Society of Dyers and Colourists, AATCC maintains the Colour Index, an international reference database of pigments and dyes.\n\nLocal sections and student chapters are formed by association members located in a particular geographical area. Sections and chapters further the exchange of textile information by arranging local meetings, lectures, and other technical or social activities. Several sections make up a region.\n\nAATCC is administered by a board of directors, including regional representatives who are elected by the members from their region, and Interest Group Chairs and At-Large members, who are elected from their Interest Groups. Eligible members of all regions elect the AATCC President-Elect. After two years, the President-Elect becomes President, who serves two years in that office before becoming Past-President for an additional two-year term (six years total commitment with specific duties and responsibilities for each office). AATCC staff is based at the AATCC Technical Center and provides administrative assistance to the board.\n\nResearch committees, made up of volunteer members, are responsible for test method development. Administrative committees, also consisting of volunteer members, are responsible for the various activities of the association.\n\nThere are three Interest Groups within AATCC:\n\nThe Chemical Applications Interest Group stimulates and expands its members' knowledge base of applying chemicals (preparation aids, colorants, finishes, polymers, etc.) to textile substrates. This includes the technologies, equipment, systems, and processes used, as well as the tested physical/mechanical properties of treated materials.\n\nThe Concept 2 Consumer (C2C) Interest Group focuses on the creation of textiles and textile-containing products, from design to retail. C2C activities promote the association to the retail, merchandising, and design communities to increase membership and participation in activities benefiting textile, apparel, and home fashions production.\n\nThe Materials Interest Group addresses the latest innovations in fibers and fiber products, including smart textiles, novel fibers, medical/biomedical, and protective textiles. Areas of interest include modifications of existing structures and the creation of unique chemical-, polymer-, and fiber-based materials. The Materials Interest Group concentrates on the science and engineering used to create new materials, along with any technologies, equipment, systems, and processes developed for their commercial production and their tested physical/mechanical properties.\n\nAATCC was founded in 1921 by Dr. Louis Atwell Olney, professor, Lowell Technological Institute and other textile professionals in the Boston area (Massachusetts, USA). Since 1964, the association has been headquartered at the AATCC Technical Center in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA. A complete history of AATCC (to 1996) is covered in the book \"Dyeing for a Living\" by Mark Clark and published by AATCC.\n\nAATCC has individual, student, and corporate members in areas of the textile industry such as retail quality control, design, and merchandising; textile and apparel manufacturing; textile fiber, dye, chemical, instrument, and machinery manufacturing; testing labs; and academia.\n\n"}

Depending on the employer's policies, differing number of days may be offered, and the employee may be required to give a certain amount of advance notice, may have to coordinate with the employer to be sure that staffing is adequately covered during the employee's absence, and other requirements may have to be met. The vast majority of countries today mandate a minimum amount of paid annual leave by law, though the United States is a notable exception in mandating no minimum paid leave and treating it as a perk rather than a right.\n\nMost countries around the world have labour laws that mandate employers give a certain number of paid time-off days per year to workers. Canada requires at least two weeks (and at least three weeks for most workers in Saskatchewan); in the European Union the countries can set freely the minimum, but it has to be at least equivalent to 4 working weeks. Full-time employment in Australia requires twenty annual leave days a year. US law does not require employers to grant any vacation or holidays, and about 25 per cent of all employees receive no paid vacation time or paid holidays.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States, the average paid holidays for full-time employees in small private establishments in 1996 was 7.6 days. Members of the US Armed Forces earn 30 vacation days a year, not including national holidays. Although the law does not mandate vacation time, many employers nonetheless offer paid vacation, typically around 10 work days in the private sector, to attract employees. Under US federal law, employers usually must compensate terminated employees for accrued but unused vacation time. Additionally, many American employers provide paid days off for national holidays, such as Christmas, New Year's Day, Independence Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving.\n\nSome countries, such as Denmark and Italy, or particular companies may mandate summer holidays in specific periods.\n\nArgentina has different labour laws, for public employment and private employment. Public employees, have between a minimum of 21 days paid to 45 days paid for vacations (including holidays and weekends). Private employees have since 14 paid days to 28 paid days (including holidays and weekends). In both cases is always relying on the years of service. The more years the worker has the more days of paid vacation they will have.\n\nConsecutive holidays refers to holidays that occur in a group without working days in between. In the late 1990s, the Japanese government passed a law that increased the likelihood of consecutive holidays by moving holidays from fixed days to a relative position in a month, such as the second Monday.\n\n"}

He was the first American to be the Master of an Oxford college, and was a significant benefactor to the College.\n\nArthur Goodhart was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the youngest of three children born to Harriet \"Hattie\" (née Lehman) and Philip Julius Goodhart. His siblings were Howard Goodhart and Helen Goodhart Altschul (married to Frank Altschul). His maternal grandfather was Mayer Lehman, one of three brothers who co-founded the investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Goodhart was educated at the Hotchkiss School, Yale University and Trinity College, Cambridge. At Yale, he was an editor of campus humor magazine \"The Yale Record\". After returning to the United States, he practised law until World War I. Following the war, he started to pursue an academic career in law, initially at Cambridge University and later at Oxford University where he became Professor of Jurisprudence and subsequently the Master of University College. He was editor of the \"Law Quarterly Review\" for fifty years.\n\nRejected for service with British forces in World War I, in 1914, Goodhart became a member of the U.S. forces when the U.S. joined the war in 1917; he became counsel to the U.S. mission to Poland, in 1919.\n\nGoodhart was called to the bar by the Inner Temple 1919, and became a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and university lecturer in jurisprudence; he edited the \"Cambridge Law Journal\", 1921–5, and the \"Law Quarterly Review\", 1926.

The BigChampagne dashboard is used primarily by music industry professionals such as concert promoters, venues, radio programmers, managers, agents, and marketers to access information about the popularity of artists and songs across radio airplay, online streaming, social activity, sales, and live events. BigChampagne provides a number of services related to producing business intelligence (BI) and competitive intelligence (CI) for users of the dashboard via access to proprietary data and data management (integration and analysis) combined with web applications and other technologies.\n\nBigChampagne was co-founded by Eric Garland, Adam Toll, and Zachary Allison in 2000. The company was funded entirely by the founders, without outside capital. Musician Glen Phillips was an early adviser and supporter. The company's earliest service tracked the popularity of songs on the original Napster file-sharing service.\n\nCo-founder Adam Toll has said that the company was named for a lyric in the Peter Tosh song \"Downpressor Man\": \"You drink your big champagne and laugh.\"\n\nBigChampagne has courted some controversy; the company's early focus on Napster and other file sharing networks originally discouraged major music companies from working with them. In 2003, founder Eric Garland testified before the California State Senate that online file sharing was \"fundamentally unstoppable.\" The Recording Industry Association of America publicly criticized his remarks. Beginning in 2002 BigChampagne was involved in a lawsuit with a company called Webspins. Both companies alleged defamation and unfair business practices. The suit was settled out of court in 2003 but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Also in 2003, Altnet, a distribution partner of file sharing service Kazaa, sent legal threats to BigChampagne and eight other companies alleging patent infringement. BigChampagne was dropped from the list of targeted companies almost immediately.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation hoped to use the record industry's relationship with BigChampagne to defend file sharing networks like Kazaa as they believed using the networks for market information constituted a non-infringing use of the networks. This defense proved unsuccessful.\n\nData provided by BigChampagne is used by companies to help make decisions about signing artists and promoting music online and to radio stations; broadcasters use BigChampagne to inform playlist decisions. Led Zeppelin used BigChampagne to choose songs for a 2007 reunion \"with good results.\" BigChampagne also collaborated with Radiohead to assess the impact of the band's pay-what-you-wish album In Rainbows.\n\nIn 2006, BigChampagne contributed data and analysis to Wired editor-in-chief Chris Anderson and was featured in \"The New York Times\" best-seller \"The Long Tail: Why the Future Business is Selling Less of More\".\n\nBigChampagne's metrics and analysis have been cited by media outlets including \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Financial Times\", \"USA Today\", and National Public Radio (NPR).\n\nIn 2011, BigChampagne was acquired by Live Nation Entertainment and is currently part of OnTour with Ticketmaster.\n\nBigChampagne generates revenue from dashboard subscription fees and consulting fees. The company is primarily a \"B2B\", selling information \"business-to-business,\" though some aspects of BigChampagne's data and analysis are available to the general public. The company's business model is similar to the Bloomberg Terminal, Omniture, or a number of Nielsen Company products and services.\n\nBigChampagne's BC Dash is a software platform for integrating, analyzing, and reporting information about radio airplay, online streaming, social activity, sales, and live events.\n\nPartners and data sources include iHeartMedia, Mediabase, YouTube, iTunes, TIDAL, VEVO, Napster, Slacker, StreetPulse, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n\nThe Ultimate Chart is a ranked list of the most popular music based on sales, radio, streaming, & social media.

Perhaps best known for his work at Palladium Books from July 1998 through May 2002, he made significant contributions to several of Palladium's game series, most notably \"Palladium Fantasy\", but also \"Heroes Unlimited\" and \"Rifts\", and created his own game, \"Systems Failure\".\n\nBill Coffin is a well-received author who made many books for Palladium Books from 1988-2002. He was a contributor to \"Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing\" and \"Rifts\". In his post-apocalyptic game \"Systems Failure\" (1999), Y2K was real. However, due to a conflict with Kevin Siembieda, the president and co-founder of Palladium Books, Coffin left the company, much to the disappointment of his fans. Coffin was let go by Siembieda due to editorial differences and general discontent with the \"Rifts Coalition Wars\" (which Siembieda and Coffin had co-authored). At the time of his departure, Coffin was the lead author of six titles in the final stages of production. He was subsequently demoted to second- and third-author status on two of these books prior to their release, and the other four were ultimately shelved and have not been rescheduled for publication. In addition, having only received limited support from Palladium, \"Systems Failure\" has since gone out of print.\n\nIn March 2007, it was revealed that Coffin was working on \"Septimus\", a new campaign setting for the \"D6 Space\" core book for West End Games. However, due to financial concerns, the publisher cancelled the project in March 2008. Shortly thereafter, Coffin declared that he would release the game as a PDF under Evil Hat Productions' \"FATE\" system. In May 2009, West End Games announced that they had agreed to publish \"Septimus\" again and that it would be released August 2009. Eric Gibson released \"Bill Coffin's Septimus\" in 2009 as a PDF, which became West End Games's last product.

{"id": "1132096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1132096", "title": "Bill of materials", "text": "Bill of materials\n\nA bill of materials or product structure (sometimes bill of material, BOM or associated list) is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts, and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product. A BOM may be used for communication between manufacturing partners or confined to a single manufacturing plant. A bill of materials is often tied to a production order whose issuance may generate reservations for components in the bill of materials that are in stock and requisitions for components that are not in stock.\n\nA BOM can define products as they are designed (engineering bill of materials), as they are ordered (sales bill of materials), as they are built (manufacturing bill of materials), or as they are maintained (service bill of materials). The different types of BOMs depend on the business need and use for which they are intended. In process industries, the BOM is also known as the formula, recipe, or ingredients list. The phrase \"bill of material\" (or \"BOM\") is frequently used by engineers as an adjective to refer not to the literal bill, but to the current production configuration of a product, to distinguish it from modified or improved versions under study or in test.\n\nSometimes the term \"pseudo-bill of materials\" or \"pseudo-BOM\" is used to refer to a more flexible or simplified version. Often a place-holder part number is used to represent a group of related (usually standard) parts that have common attributes and are interchangeable in the context of this BOM.\n\nIn electronics, the BOM represents the list of components used on the printed wiring board or printed circuit board. Once the design of the circuit is completed, the BOM list is passed on to the PCB layout engineer as well as the component engineer who will procure the components required for the design.\n\nBOMs are of hierarchical nature, with the top level representing the finished product which may be a sub-assembly or a completed item. BOMs that describe the sub-assemblies are referred to as modular BOMs. An example of this is the NAAMS BOM that is used in the automotive industry to list all the components in an assembly line. The structure of the NAAMS BOM is System, Line, Tool, Unit and Detail.\n\nThe first hierarchical databases were developed for automating bills of materials for manufacturing organizations in the early 1960s. At present, this BOM is used as a data base to identify the many parts and their codes in automobile manufacturing companies.\n\nA bill of materials \"implosion\" links component pieces to a major assembly, while a bill of materials \"explosion\" breaks apart each assembly or sub-assembly into its component parts.\n\nA modular BOM can be displayed in the following formats:\n\nA BOM can also be visually represented by a product structure tree, although they are rarely used in the workplace. For example, one of them is Time-Phased Product Structure where this diagram illustrates the time needed to build or acquire the needed components to assemble the final product. For each product, the time phased product structure shows the sequence and duration of each operation.\n\nA configurable bill of materials (CBOM) is a form of BOM used by industries that have multiple options and highly configurable products (e.g. telecom systems, data-center hardware (SANS, servers, etc.), PCs, cars).\n\nThe CBOM is used to dynamically create \"end-items\" that a company sells. The benefit of using CBOM structure is that it reduces the work-effort needed to maintain product structures. The configurable BOM is most frequently driven by \"configurator\" software, however it can be enabled manually (manual maintenance is infrequent because it is unwieldy to manage the number of permutations and combinations of possible configurations). The development of the CBOM is dependent on having a modular BOM structure in place. The modular BOM structure provides the assemblies/sub-systems that can be selected to \"configure\" an end-item.\n\nWhile most configurators utilize top-down hierarchical rules syntax to find appropriate modular BOMs, maintenance of very similar BOMs (i.e., only one component is different for various voltages) becomes highly excessive. A newer approach, (bottom-up/rules-based structuring) utilizing a proprietary search engine scheme transversing through selectable componentry at high speeds eliminates the planning modular BOM duplications. The search engine is also used for all combinatorial feature constraints and GUI representations to support specification selections.\n\nTo decide which assembly variant of the parts or components is to be chosen, they are attributed by the product options which are the characteristic features of the product. If the options of the product build an ideal Boolean algebra, it is possible to describe the connection between parts and product variants with a Boolean expression, which refers to a subset of the set of products.\n\nParts which will not be assembled at all in one or more variants are typically marked as \"DNP\" (for \"do not populate\" or \"do not place\") in the affected variants. Other less frequently used designators for this include \"NP\" (\"no placement\", \"not placed\"), \"DNM\" (\"do not mount\"), \"NM\" (\"not mounted\"), \"DNI\" (\"do not install\"), \"DNE\" (\"do not equip\"), \"DNA\" (\"do not assemble\"), \"DNS\" (\"do not stuff\"), \"NOFIT\" etc.\n\nA multi-level bill of materials (BOM), referred to as an indented BOM, is a bill of materials that lists the assemblies, components, and parts required to make a product in a parent-child, top-down method. It provides a display of all items that are in parent-children relationships. When an item is a sub-component, of a (parent) component, it can in-turn have its own child components, and so on. The resulting top-level BOM (item number) would include children; a mix of finished sub-assemblies, various parts and raw materials. A multi-level structure can be illustrated by a tree with several levels. In contrast, a single-level structure only consists of one level of children in components, assemblies and material.\n\n\n"}

It is one of stock car racing's most legendary venues, and is referred to as \"NASCAR's longest-running weekly race track\". Bowman Gray Stadium is part of the Winston-Salem Sports and Entertainment Complex and is home of the Winston-Salem State University Rams football team. It was also the home of the Wake Forest University football team from 1956 until Groves Stadium (later BB&T Field) opened in 1968. Bowman Gray Stadium was a popular venue for high school football in the 1970s and 1980s. Parkland and R.J. Reynolds High Schools shared Bowman Gray Stadium as their home field for high school football until the two schools built their own facility (Deaton-Thompson Stadium) in 1994.\n\nThe stadium was built in 1937 as a public works project to provide jobs during the Great Depression. The first event at the new stadium was a football game in the fall of 1938 between Wake Forest College and Duke University. In the beginning, the stadium's sole use was for collegiate football until trotter horse racing was added on the .250-mile dirt oval. The first auto racing at Bowman Gray was a type of midget auto racing on the dirt quarter mile track from 1939-1949. The track was paved in 1947, after a promoter got the City of Winston-Salem to agree to pay to have the track paved in exchange for restitution of payments through a percentage of future income from races. However, after the track was paved the promoter fled before any payments were made to the city. Stock car racing at Bowman Gray Stadium was started by Bill France Sr. and Alvin Hawkins, two men who were founding fathers of NASCAR. The track was NASCAR's very first weekly track. The track would run weekly NASCAR sanctioned events during the summer months.\n\nThe first NASCAR-sanctioned event took place on May 18, 1949, and was won by Fonty Flock. The track was opened by NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. and Alvin Hawkins, and remains operated by members of the Hawkins family to this day. By the end of the inaugural Bowman Gray season 11 races had been run and five more were rained out. Tim Flock won the track championship with a season that included four wins.\n\nAs the racing had become extremely popular at the track an additional of seating 7,000 seats were built connecting the east and west grandstands in 1953. It raised the seating capacity from 10,000 to 17,000.\n\nThe track has hosted many different series through the years, including The Grand National Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series), NASCAR Convertible Division, NASCAR Late Model Short Track Division, NASCAR Grand American Series, Dash Series, NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour, NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Division (now Xfinity Series) and NASCAR K&N Pro Series. The first Grand National event took place in 1958 and it was won by Bob Welborn. Other winners include Glen Wood, Rex White, David Pearson, Richard Petty, Bobby Allison, Junior Johnson and Marvin Panch. Richard Petty won his 100th race at the track. The Grand National Series first raced at the track in 1958 and hosted a total of 29 Grand National races through 1971.\n\nMotorcycle races were run on a temporary dirt track at the stadium in 1970 and 1971. The stock car races were run first in the events before construction crews would lay dirt down during an intermission for motorcycles races the same night.\n\nBowman Gray's nickname, the \"Madhouse,\" is largely attributed to the racing antics that take place on the tight, quarter mile bull ring. In 2014, Bowman Gray's promoter, Gray Garrison described the events at BGS as part racing, part religion, and part wrestling. While this is partially the reason for the nickname, it actually originated from a qualifying format the track used in the 1950s called the \"mad scramble.\" \n\nIn 2015, Bowman Gray celebrated its 1,000th NASCAR sanctioned race \n\nOn November 14, 2018, it was announced that the Stadium would get a $9 Million renovation. It will begin in 2019, with construction starting in 2020 and ending in 2022. It will include new restrooms, a track resurface, and a new name for the football field entitled \"Rams Field At Bowman Gray\". \nCurrently, the track features four divisions: the modifieds, sportsman, street stock and stadium stock. The modifieds are the featured division at Bowman Gray, the division started in 1949 and the all-time wins list features some of the best NASCAR drivers including Lee Petty, Ralph Earnhardt, Ned Jarrett, Richie Evans, and Jerry Cook.\n\nThe football history of the stadium is also quite storied. Wake Forest University played home games in the stadium from its move to Winston-Salem in 1956, until the 1968 season when Groves Stadium (now BB&T Field) opened. Players such as Brian Piccolo, the 1964 ACC Player of the Year who led the nation in rushing and scoring, played his home games in Bowman Gray. Piccolo later became famous as the teammate of Gale Sayers with the Chicago Bears, and the subject of the 1971 film \"Brian's Song\". The Winston-Salem high schools of R.J.Reynolds High and Parkland High also played their home games at the stadium in the late 1960s through the 1980s.\n\nBowman Gray's weekly racing tradition continues as part of the Whelen All-American Series, with races Saturday evenings from the end of April through August. The track can seat 17,000 people in the stands, with an additional 2,000 standing-room around the wall above the seating areas. The weekly races during the year normally have an average attendance between 12,000 and 15,000 per night. Many events are standing room only, as some events have had estimated crowds of more than 23,000 show up.\n\nWeekly races include the modified, sportsman, street stock and stadium stock divisions. Bowman Gray is also a part of the special events including classic modified coupes and East Coast Flathead Ford Racing Association (ECFFRA), monster trucks, demolition derbies, chain races, skid races and INEX Legends Car and bandolero races. The History Channel show \"MadHouse\" was taped at the track during the 2009 season. The showed aired in January 2010 and ran through April 2010. On October 29, 2018, a new show entitled \"Race Night At Bowman Gray\" will air on Discovery Channel. The show will focus on the Modified Division. After the first few episodes, the show was moved to the Discovery Go App and Motor Trend (TV network), after fear of cancellation.\n\nSpectators listen to the officials during the races on frequencies 461.200 MHz, 463.625 MHz, and 466.600 MHz on a scanner or \"race radio.\" Many, if not all of the drivers also communicate via a two-way radio during the race. Most of them use a frequency between 450-470 MHz, but there are exceptions.\n\nNOTES:\n\nModified and sportsman car counts were thin during the latter part of the 1950s and the track combined the two and let the V6s run with the V8s and named it the \"Modified-Sportsman Division\". Leading into the 1968 season, the track dropped the sportsman cars and title, hence officially named the featured division as the modifieds.\n\nThe Amateur Division was the support division to the modified-sportsman and ran from 1950 to mid-1958, where the division dissolved and the track picked up the Hobby Division.\n\nThe Claiming Division was tabbed as a third weekly division in 1964. It was a division that cost only $99 to run, it was so popular that the track had to cut the fields down to two races with ten cars apiece. The division ran from 1964 to 1972. The track changed the name to what is now the Sportsman Division.\n\nThe Hobby Division, which was the predecessor of the Street Stock Division, ran from mid-1958 to 1974. Then the following year, the division was renamed to the street stock.\n\nBowman Gray ran Blunderbust races as a fourth division from 1977-1989 until they replaced that division with the Buzzbomber Division in 1990. The following season, the track kept the cars, but changed the division to what is now the Stadium Stock Division.\n\n\n"}

He became a significant operator in 1878 when he started winter season shipping between Hanko and Stockholm. Korsman laid the basis to the Finnish winter season shipping together with captain August Alexander Granroth.\n\nKorsman founded also Vätti techno-chemical factory and engineering company \"Åbo Mekaniska Verkstads Ab\". He developed the Hanko spa the most prominent in Finland.\n\nKorsman retired in 1895 and moved to Helsinki, where he died in 1907.\n\nKorsman was born in Pyhämaa, Finland Proper. His parents were vicar of Merikarvia Johan Jacob Korsman and Amalia Carolina née Achander. Korsman studied six years in Pori trivial school, after which he went to military.\n\nKorsman started his military career in Finnish Rifle Battalion in which he served as junior non-commissioned officer in 1846–1849, Fähnrich with Portepee in 1849–1851 and ensign in 1851–1852. After this he was relocated to Finnish Grenadier Rifle battalion; he became sub-lieutenant in 1853 and in 1855 he was promoted lieutenant. In 1856 Korsman became company commander in Turku Rifle Battalion. He became first staff captain and in 1868 he became captain. Korsman left the military in the same year.\n\nIn 1868 Korsman started trading firewood in Turku, but already in the following year he moved to a new line of business: Korsman bought a screw-propeller steamer named \"Ahkera\" and started liner shipping between Turku and Salo. In the 1870s he expanded from coastal shipping to liner shipping between Turku and Stockholm, and cargo shipping in the Baltic Sea. Korsman aimed to use the latest technology and to increase the capacity. In 1874 Korsman founded shipping company \"Ångfartygsaktiebolaget Åbo\" to operate between Stockholm and Saint Petersburg by steamship \"Åbo\", which was the largest steamship built in Finland until then.\n\nA company called \"Finska Transito-ångbåtsaktiebolaget\" had started winter season operation between Hanko and Stockholm in 1876 by 298-tonne \"S/S Express\". Due to unprofitable summer season operation the company bankrupted in 1878. The state regarded a year-round operation to Sweden highly important, and sought for successor for the operation. Korsman saw the potential of steam shipping for wintertime operation, and rented the ship from the state which had confiscated it due to outstanding payments. He moved to Hanko and recruited captain August Alexander Granroth to master the ship. \"Express\" sailed weekly between Stockholm and Hanko between 15 November and 15 May. Out of total 303 journeys planned during 1878–1889, 242 were successful despite of difficult ice conditions at times. Korsman played with a high risk, because no a marine insurance company agreed giving an insurance to a such operation; on the other hand, the Grand Duchy and city of Stockholm supported him financially.\n\nDuring the 1880s the number of passengers grew and in addition to mail delivery, Korsman exported Finnish butter and paper to the Swedish and British market. Korsman and captain Granroth created the basis for the Finnish winter shipping, and Hanko became the centre of it. In 1889 the state organised a Danish icebreaker to ease manoeuvring in ice and in the following year the first state-owned icebreaker started in service. Korsman planned to grow his business and buy another ship alongside the \"Express\" which he had earlier purchased from the state, but gave up with the plan due to health reasons. He built a four-floor house in Helsinki, close to South Harbour in 1895.\n\nKorsman was founder and manager of Vätti techno-chemical factory started in 1872. In 1874 he took part at founding engineering company \"Åbo Mekaniska Verkstads Ab\" and became its manager.\n\nDuring 1880–1890 Korsman was the manager of Hanko spa, which developed the most significant spa of Finland during his leadership.\n\nKorsman took part in many municipal positions of trust both in Turku and Hanko. He was chairman of Hanko town council in 1890–1891. During 1885–1889 Korsman participated in three committees which aimed developing the Finnish seafaring.\n\nIn 1854 Korsman married Isabella Charlotta née Ramsell (1832–1907). The couple got 12 children in 1855–1875; ten of them lived until adulthood.\n"}
{"id": "818329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=818329", "title": "Co-counselling", "text": "Co-counselling\n\nCo-counselling (spelled co-counseling in American English) is a grassroots method of personal change based on reciprocal peer counselling. It uses simple methods. Time is shared equally and the essential requirement of the person taking their turn in the role of counsellor is to do their best to listen and give their full attention to the other person. It is not a discussion; the aim is to support the person in the client role to work through their own issues in a mainly self-directed way.\n\nCo-counselling was originally formulated in the early 1950s by the American Harvey Jackins and originated in a schism in the Dianetics movement (itself in part derived from schisms in General Semantics and Cybernetics). Jackins founded the Re-evaluation Counseling (RC) Communities, with headquarters in Seattle, Washington, United States. His son, Tim Jackins, is currently the international leader of Re-evaluation Counseling and its main affiliates.\n\nThere are a number of smaller, separate, independent organizations that have resulted from breakaways from, or re-workings of, Re-evaluation Counseling. The principal one of these is Co-Counseling International (CCI).\n\nThe main activity in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs to give each other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking the role of counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. The person in the role of counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.\n\nSafety (in the sense of being very low risk) and the sense that a co-counselling session is a safe space is important to the methods. There are strict rules of confidentiality. In most circumstances, the counsellor may not talk about a client's session without explicit and specific permission by the client. This is stricter than in other practices where practitioners discuss clients with supervisors, colleagues and sometimes with all sorts of other people. The peer relationship makes a considerable contribution to a sense of trust.\n\nThe nature of the co-counselling session opens up the possibility for people to get in touch with emotions that they would avoid in any other circumstance. A belief in the value of working with emotions has become a core focus of the approach. Co-counselling training emphasizes methods for accessing and working with emotions, and co-counsellors aim to develop and improve emotional competence through the practice. Evidence as to the actual effectiveness of this method is undemonstrated.\n\nTo get involved in co-counselling, it is usually first necessary to complete a Fundamentals course. The training involves learning how to carry out the roles of client and counsellor. Trainers may be counsellors or simply experienced members of the community. It also covers the guidelines or rules affecting co-counselling for the particular organization. Differences in approach mean that each organization normally requires completion of one of its own courses as a prerequisite for membership, even if someone has already completed a course with another organization.\n\nThe original theory of co-counselling centres on the concept of distress patterns. These are patterns of behaviour, that is, behaviour that tends to be repeated in a particular type of circumstance, that are irrational, unhelpful or compulsive. The theory is that these patterns are driven by the accumulated consequences in the mind of (not currently) conscious memories of past events in which the person was unable to express or discharge the emotion appropriate to the event. Co-counselling enables release from the patterns by allowing \"emotional discharge\" of the past hurt experiences. Such cathartic discharge includes crying, warm perspiration, trembling, yawning, laughing and relaxed, non-repetitive talking. In day-to-day life, these \"discharging\" actions may be limited by social norms, such as, for example, taboos around crying, which are widespread in many cultures.\n\nHaving temporary, undivided, supportive attention from another person often gives rise to strong feelings towards that person; your counsellor often becomes your best friend for life. Sometimes people \"fall in love\" with each other. This is similar to the phenomenon of transference, particularly when one of the partners is felt to have more authority because, for instance, they are more experienced, are teachers of co-counselling, or have authority roles within the organisation. The organisations differ in the ways that they handle this. The inability to trust and feel in real relationships is sometimes exacerbated by the intimacy of co-counselling relationship, making transference a possibility. But participants are strongly encouraged and supported to counsel through these feelings, often leading to profound changes in their perspectives and abilities around closeness. For the most part, co-counselling relationships become life-long, therapeutic partnerships that enable the participant to have healthier relationships in general.\n\nMany co-counsellors take the view, often quite strongly, that co-counselling is not psychotherapy. In the beginning, this was because Re-evaluation Counseling decided not to draw on any discipline of psychotherapy for its theory and practice, although RC did incorporate some ideas from psycho-analysis such as \"unconscious promptings\" which Jackins adapted and relabeled \"restimulation\". A similar view is taken by some non-RC co-counsellors who regard psychotherapy as involving specialist techniques used by a therapist on a client and is therefore not peer and the client has little or no control over the process.\n\nOthers consider that co-counselling is psychotherapeutic, in that it enables change or therapy to take place in the psyche, soul affect or being of an individual. Co-counselling takes a positive view of the person (i.e. we are all essentially good), considers the mind and body as an integrated whole and acknowledges the value of catharsis; it is regarded as an approach within humanistic psychology, a view that would be rejected by some within RC. \n\nThe core organization structure of RC consists of classes and local communities set up by experienced co-counsellors, which are in turn organized by regions and country.\n\nThe term \"re-evaluation\" refers to the client's need to rethink their past distress experiences after the emotional hurt in those experiences have been discharged, and thereby regain (\"re-emerge\" with) their natural intellectual and emotional capacities. The RC organization and literature do not accept the description of its practice as psychotherapy, maintaining instead that the process of developing distress patterns that dissolve through emotional discharge in the context of appreciative attention is simply a natural process that does not imply either psychopathology on the part of the individual or the need for professional treatment. Re-evaluation Counseling regards other forms of \"mainstream counselling\" and psychotherapy in general as frequently inadequate attempts to bring about relief from distress using methods that do not focus on discharge and re-emergence.\n\nIn RC, the client and counsellor are expected to work co-operatively, participants are expected to provide non-judgmental active listening and to \"contradict\" the misinformation or other conditions thought to be associated with distress patterns. RC also engages techniques such as \"non-permissive\" counselling, in which the counsellor intervenes to \"interrupt\" client patterns without the consent of the client. The structure of RC is one of clearly defined leadership, to encourage clarity in the difficult struggles many people have to achieve breakthroughs against their distresses. RC encourages counsellors to think very hard about all possible ways to assist the client in discharging.\n\nRC approaches the issue of feelings between co-counsellors by having a strict \"no-socialising\" rule. RC co-counsellors are expected not to socialise or have social or sexual relationships with other co-counsellors unless these relationships pre-dated their becoming co-counsellors. RC specifically rejects the label \"transference\" for this phenomenon, as this is seen as part of a \"symptomatic\" method typical in psychology; the original theory of co-counselling (from RC) teaches that the best thing to do in these circumstances is repeatedly counsel on, and \"discharge\" about, such feelings. In addition, methods of \"getting attention out of distress\" are available which help with the difficulty of \"switching roles\" between counsellor and client. When taught correctly, counsellors are soon able to grasp the difference between counselling relationships and those from outside life. However, sometimes there is a marked pull to \"socialise\" or confuse the boundaries of the co-counselling relationship with other types of relationships. This is one reason why many consider a well-organised community of co-counsellors with clear rules to be essential in the successful practise of co-counselling.\n\nRe-evaluation Counseling places a high importance on the need to understand and adhere to a comprehensive theory about the nature of the universe and of human beings (known in general as the \"Benign Reality\"), the best ways of assisting the discharge process and of pro-liberation attitudes in co-counselling. RCers believe that, when taken together, these enable the counsellor to keep a clear picture of the client's \"re-emergence\" and are therefore very effective. People disagreeing with the theoretical perspective are asked to think and discharge on the points at issue before actively challenging such perspectives. The main aim is to provide a safe, stable and supportive atmosphere within which people can client skillfully and also lead \"re-emergent lives\" where they are not dependent in a therapeutic sense, but instead become more energetic and effective (a state known as \"zestfulness\" in RC).\n\nCo-Counselling International (CCI) was started in 1974 as a breakaway from Re-evaluation Counseling by John Heron, who was at the time director of the Human Potential Research Project, University of Surrey UK, and Tom Sargent and Dency Sargent from Hartford, Connecticut, United States. Unlike other breakaways from RC, which involved changes of leadership but otherwise continued to practice in similar ways to RC, the CCI break was ideological, and CCI developed in significantly different ways. The differences are in practice, theory and organisation.\n\nIn practice, the client in CCI co-counselling is wholly in charge of the session. In other words, client and counsellor do not work co-operatively. The counsellor only intervenes in accordance with one of three levels of \"contract\"—free attention, normal and intensive—which are defined in CCI's principles. The only requirement of the counsellor is that they give \"free attention\" (that is, full supportive attention) to the client. The other two contracts constitute invitations to the counsellor to make interventions from within those permitted if they feel it is appropriate. The intensive contract can be similar to the RC way of working, although the counsellor is still not permitted to intervene as flexibly as in RC.\n\nThe original theory of co-counselling is taught in the CCI fundamentals training courses, and participants learn techniques for releasing, or \"discharging\", emotions. However, the theory is not seen as a constraint within CCI, and co-counsellors draw on the whole range of psychotherapeutic theory and methods including analytical, cognitive-behavioural and transpersonal as well as humanistic approaches. The principal constraint is that the client must be able to work self-directedly.\n\nOrganisationally, CCI is a peer network with no core structure. Local and national networks have a variety of organisation. Classes and activities are organised by individuals or groups acting self-directedly. John Heron's status within the network has always been as an equal member, although inevitably as a founder member and activist for some 15 years and the person who developed much of the thinking behind CCI, there was a certain amount of transference on him. Heron now lives in New Zealand and is involved with the CCI network there.\n\nCCI approaches the issue of personal relationships between co-counsellors as a matter for raising awareness. CCI co-counsellors may and do have the whole range of personal relationships with other co-counsellors. However, new co-counsellors are encouraged not to develop new non-co-counselling relationships with other co-counsellors until they have more experience and experienced co-counsellors will often have people with whom they only have a co-counselling relationship. Teachers of co-counselling are strongly discouraged from having sexual relationships with people they have taught.\n\nThe existence of other co-counselling organisations is generally not mentioned in RC, and RC co-counsellors are often not aware of their existence.\n\nAmongst those within RC who know about it, CCI is often seen as an \"attack organisation\" and was specifically condemned as such in many private and public conversations by Jackins, who claimed that Heron had started it against a specific agreement not to, and in breach of RC guidelines he had previously agreed to. In turn, Heron and many of his supporters claimed that RC was authoritarian and cult-like, and later, that Jackins engaged in sexual abuse of clients. RC supporters parried that CCI fostered a sexually-liberal atmosphere that blurred the boundaries of co-counselling and relationships. \n\nThe history of co-counselling including its origins with RC is normally taught on CCI Fundamentals courses. CCI, by its nature, has no corporate opinion about RC, and individual CCI co-counsellors have their own views. Most CCI co-counsellors have a benevolent view toward RC, regarding it as a different, alternative approach to co-counselling. Membership of RC is not a bar to membership of CCI, and a few people manage to do both despite the RC ban.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6778039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6778039", "title": "Dimensional modeling", "text": "Dimensional modeling\n\nDimensional modeling (DM) is part of the \"Business Dimensional Lifecycle\" methodology developed by Ralph Kimball which includes a set of methods, techniques and concepts for use in data warehouse design. The approach focuses on identifying the key business processes within a business and modelling and implementing these first before adding additional business processes, a bottom-up approach. An alternative approach from Inmon advocates a top down design of the model of all the enterprise data using tools such as entity-relationship modeling (ER).\n\nDimensional modeling always uses the concepts of facts (measures), and dimensions (context). Facts are typically (but not always) numeric values that can be aggregated, and dimensions are groups of hierarchies and descriptors that define the facts. For example, sales amount is a fact; timestamp, product, register#, store#, etc. are elements of dimensions. Dimensional models are built by business process area, e.g. store sales, inventory, claims, etc. Because the different business process areas share some but not all dimensions, efficiency in design, operation, and consistency, is achieved using conformed dimensions, i.e. using one copy of the shared dimension across subject areas.\n\nDimensional modeling does not necessarily involve a relational database. The same modeling approach, at the logical level, can be used for any physical form, such as multidimensional database or even flat files. It is oriented around understandability and performance.\n\nThe dimensional model is built on a star-like schema or snowflake schema, with dimensions surrounding the fact table. To build the schema, the following design model is used:\n\n\nThe process of dimensional modeling builds on a 4-step design method that helps to ensure the usability of the dimensional model and the use of the data warehouse. The basics in the design build on the actual business process which the data warehouse should cover. Therefore, the first step in the model is to describe the business process which the model builds on. This could for instance be a sales situation in a retail store. To describe the business process, one can choose to do this in plain text or use basic Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) or other design guides like the Unified Modeling Language (UML).\n\nAfter describing the business process, the next step in the design is to declare the grain of the model. The grain of the model is the exact description of what the dimensional model should be focusing on. This could for instance be “An individual line item on a customer slip from a retail store”. To clarify what the grain means, you should pick the central process and describe it with one sentence. Furthermore, the grain (sentence) is what you are going to build your dimensions and fact table from. You might find it necessary to go back to this step to alter the grain due to new information gained on what your model is supposed to be able to deliver.\n\nThe third step in the design process is to define the dimensions of the model. The dimensions must be defined within the grain from the second step of the 4-step process. Dimensions are the foundation of the fact table, and is where the data for the fact table is collected. Typically dimensions are nouns like date, store, inventory etc. These dimensions are where all the data is stored. For example, the date dimension could contain data such as year, month and weekday.\n\nAfter defining the dimensions, the next step in the process is to make keys for the fact table. This step is to identify the numeric facts that will populate each fact table row. This step is closely related to the business users of the system, since this is where they get access to data stored in the data warehouse. Therefore, most of the fact table rows are numerical, additive figures such as quantity or cost per unit, etc.\n\nDimensional normalization or snowflaking removes redundant attributes, which are known in the normal flatten de-normalized dimensions. Dimensions are strictly joined together in sub dimensions. \nSnowflaking has an influence on the data structure that differs from many philosophies of data warehouses.\nSingle data (fact) table surrounded by multiple descriptive (dimension) tables\n\nDevelopers often don't normalize dimensions due to several reasons:\n\n\nThere are some arguments on why normalization can be useful. It can be an advantage when part of hierarchy is common to more than one dimension. For example, a geographic dimension may be reusable because both the customer and supplier dimensions use it.\n\nBenefits of the dimensional model are the following:\n\nWe still get the benefits of dimensional models on Hadoop and similar big data frameworks. However, some features of Hadoop require us to slightly adapt the standard approach to dimensional modelling.\n\n"}

Furthermore, in a 1998 speech Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt called earnings management \"widespread\". Despite its pervasiveness, the complexity of accounting rules can make earnings management difficult for individual investors to detect.\n\nEarnings management is believed to be widespread. A 1990 report on earnings management situations stated that \"short-term earnings are being managed in many, if not all companies\", and in a 1998 speech, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Arthur Levitt called earnings management a \"widespread, but too little-challenged custom\". In a 2013 essay, Ray Ball, while opining that accounting research was not reliably documenting earnings management, wrote: \"\"Of course\" earnings management goes on. [...] People have been tried and convicted.\"\n\nThe SEC has criticized earnings management as having adverse consequences for financial reporting, and for masking \"the true consequences of management's decisions\". It has called on standard-setters to make changes to accounting standards to improve financial statement transparency, and has called for increased oversight over the financial reporting process. The SEC has also pressed charges against the management of firms involved in fraudulent earnings management.\n\nEarnings management involves the manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management is said to be carrying out \"income smoothing\". Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.\n\nEarnings management may involve exploiting opportunities to make accounting decisions that change the earnings figure reported on the financial statements. Accounting decisions can in turn affect earnings because they can influence the timing of transactions and the estimates used in financial reporting. For example, a comparatively small change in the estimates for uncollectible accounts can have a significant effect on net income, and a company using last-in, first-out accounting for inventories can increase net income in times of rising prices by delaying purchases to future periods.\n\nEarnings management may be difficult for individual investors to detect due to the complexity of accounting rules, although accounting researchers have proposed several methods. For example, research has shown that firms with large accruals and weak governance structures are more likely to be engaging in earnings management. More recent research suggested that linguistics-based methods can detect financial manipulation, for example studies in 2012 found that whether a subsequent irregularity or deceptive restatement occurred is related to the linguistics used by top management in earnings conference calls.\n\n"}

This entity classification election is made by filing Internal Revenue Service Form 8832. Absent filing the form, a default classification applies. U.S. corporations of the type that can be publicly traded must be treated as corporations. There is a list of specific foreign entities that must be treated as corporations. The election is effective for Federal and most state income tax purposes.\n\nIf an entity is not classified as a corporation, it is treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes if it has more than one owner, or is a disregarded entity if it has a single owner (i.e. is treated as part of the single owner).\n\nThe classification of either a U.S. or non-U.S. entity for U.S. tax purposes has no effect for purposes other than U.S. income tax.\n\nAn entity, which is eligible to make an election, is referred to as an eligible entity. Generally, a corporation organized under U.S. federal or state statute (and referred to as a corporation, body corporate or body politic by that statute) is not an eligible entity. However, the following types of business entity are treated as eligible entities:\n\nThe list of foreign entities classified as corporations for federal tax purposes (so called \"per se\" corporations, not eligible to make an entity classification election) includes, as of September 2009:\n\n\nIn 2013, the IRS added a Croatian dionicko drustvo to the list of per se corporations.\nAn eligible entity is classified for federal tax purposes under the default rules described below unless it files Form 8832 or Form 2553, Election by a Small Business Corporation, to elect a classification or change its current classification. The IRS uses the information entered on the form to establish the entity's filing and reporting requirements for federal tax purposes. Certain domestic and foreign entities that were in existence before January 1, 1997, and have an established federal tax classification generally do not need to make an election to continue that classification. If an existing entity decides to change its classification, it may do so subject to the 60-month limitation rule.\n\nUnless an election is made on Form 8832, a domestic eligible entity will be classified by default as:\n\nUnless an election is made on Form 8832, a foreign eligible entity will be classified by default as:\n\nThe effect of these rules is that a U.S. limited liability company (LLC) or limited liability partnership (LLP) is treated by default as a partnership (or disregarded entity if it has only one owner), whereas a foreign LLP is treated by default as a corporation (if, as is generally the case, all its members have limited liability).\n\nIf an entity has been operating under one classification for some time, but then elects to change its classification, there may be tax consequences. The initial regulations were unclear on this point, so the IRS issued Revenue Rulings 99-5 and 99-6 in 1999 to address questions surrounding the conversion of an LLC to a partnership and vice versa.\n\nThe \"check-the-box\" regulations paved the way for various new tax avoidance and tax deferral strategies. Specifically, they expanded the opportunity for \"hybrid branch\" or \"hybrid entity\" strategies, which take advantage of differences in the classification of an entity as a corporation or not in multiple jurisdictions, in order to engage in cross-border tax arbitrage. The possibility that the check-the-box rules would greatly expand the potential for such strategies had been pointed out prior to implementation, and at one point some commentators suggested disallowing foreign entities from electing their classification at all; however, in the end, the IRS, while acknowledging such concerns, issued regulations which gave foreign and domestic entities largely similar powers to elect their own classification.\n\nUS owners of foreign subsidiaries benefit from the ability to have those foreign subsidiaries treated as disregarded entities. Under the United States' Internal Revenue Code Subpart F, payments between related Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs), or from American companies to related CFCs, may be \"treated as Subpart F income\" (subject to current taxation as if they were profits in the hands of the ultimate American owner of the corporate structure), in an effort to limit the ability of American citizens and corporations to defer US tax on the income of foreign corporations they control. However, payments between an American-owned foreign entity which is taxed as a corporation, and a foreign subsidiary of that entity which itself has elected to be treated as a disregarded entity, are not treated as Subpart F income. This arrangement may be used to shift income between the two non-American jurisdictions and avoid local taxes in one or the other, e.g. through thin capitalization. Another category of US taxpayers who benefit from check-the-box regulations consists of US flow-through entities (S corporations and partnerships) with foreign subsidiaries. If the foreign subsidiary is treated as a corporation, the taxes it pays to the foreign government do not create a foreign tax credit for the US owner under Section 902. However, with a check-the-box election to be treated as a disregarded entity, the foreign taxes are treated as having been directly imposed on the US owner, thus giving rise to the tax credit.\n\nFor US owners with foreign subsidiaries, choosing to have a subsidiary treated as a disregarded entity is not always the most beneficial tax-planning choice, however. For example, if a US taxpayer owns a disregarded foreign entity, its income will be taxed at the owner's ordinary US income tax rates, less the foreign tax already paid. This may result in every marginal dollar being taxed at the highest rate. However, if the foreign entity had elected to be taxed as a corporation (or been classified as such by default), paid a low rate tax in the foreign country, then repatriated its income to the US by paying qualified dividends to its owner, the total proportion of tax paid on income might actually be less, as qualified dividends are only taxed at 15%. However, this treatment is only available for dividends from corporations in certain countries, and is set to sunset in 2010 under the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005.\n\nForeign owners of US corporations also benefit from the ability to have entities normally treated as flow-through instead be taxed as corporations by the IRS. In what is sometimes known as a \"domestic reverse hybrid\" strategy, a non-US corporation may set up a US holding company which elects to be treated as a corporation for US tax purposes, but which its home country tax law sees as a flow-through entity. The US holding company receives a loan from its home country parent which it invests in a US operating subsidiary; the US holding company receives dividends from the US operation subsidiary and pays interest to the non-US parent. US tax law thus sees a US company making a dividend payment to another US company (which is thus not subject to withholding tax, unlike a dividend paid to a foreign company) which then pays interest to a foreign company, while the home country tax law will see a US company paying dividends directly to its home country parent. Under typical treaties for the relief of double taxation, neither government has the right to tax the payment, because each sees it as a type of payment which only the other has the right to tax.\n\nPrior to 1996, whether domestic and foreign entities were classified as corporations was based on a six-factor test which looked at:\n\nAn entity which had a preponderance of the first four factors (the last two, in practice, were shared by all business entities) was treated as a corporation, otherwise as a partnership or an association. In practice, however, this test was easily manipulated.\n\nThe \"check-the-box\" regulations (Treasury Decision 8697) were adopted in 1996 in order to simplify the issue of entity classification. A grandfather clause allowed entities in existence on May 8, 1996 to continue using their previous classification, even if they would no longer be eligible to elect that classification under the new rules. There were three conditions for this grandfathering:\n\nThe initial regulations also included a list of foreign entities which would always be classified as corporations (\"per-se corporations\") and which could not elect to be disregarded. The proposed regulations included naamloze vennootschap formed under the laws of Aruba or the Netherlands Antilles in that list, but they were removed from the final list; conversely, Canadian corporations were added to the list.\n\nIn 1998, the IRS issued Notice 98-11, 1998-1 C.B. 433 in an attempt to combat the use of \"check-the-box\" in international tax planning (see below); however, the notice met opposition, and was withdrawn by Notice 98-35, 1998-2 C.B. 34. Another proposal, around 1999, would have left the basic check-the-box regime in place, but allowed the IRS to disregard entity classification elections made in connection with \"extraordinary transactions\" (where the tax liability changes \"significantly\" as a result of the election). An \"extraordinary transaction\" was defined as one in which there was a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposition of a 10-percent or greater interest in a foreign entity; the proposed regulations provided that an election to be classified as a disregarded entity could be ignored, and thus the entity continue to be taxed as a corporation, if the election occurred within twelve months following the day before an extraordinary transaction. However, various tax professionals opposed the changes, arguing that the threshold for defining an extraordinary transaction was far too low, and that existing internal revenue regulations, as well as common law doctrines such as the principle of substance over form and the step transaction doctrine, were already sufficient to combat any abuses of the check-the-box rules.\n\nPresident Barack Obama attempted to revive the IRS' 1998 notice in his proposed 2010 budget. Specifically, the proposal stated:\n\nThe proposal was eventually dropped again due to criticism from businesses, and it was not included again in the 2011 budget proposal either.\n"}

As we change parameters of the objective, the envelope theorem shows that, in a certain sense, changes in the optimizer of the objective do not contribute to the change in the objective function. The envelope theorem is an important tool for comparative statics of optimization models.\n\nLet formula_1 and formula_2 be real-valued continuously differentiable functions on formula_3, where formula_4 are choice variables and formula_5 are parameters, and consider the problem of choosing formula_6, for a given formula_7, so as to:\nThe Lagrangian expression of this problem is given by\nwhere formula_12 are the Lagrange multipliers. Now let formula_13 and formula_14 together be the solution that maximizes the objective function \"f\" subject to the constraints (and hence are saddle points of the Lagrangian),\nand define the value function\nThen we have the following theorem.\n\nTheorem: \"Assume that formula_17 and formula_18 are continuously differentiable. Then\"\n\"where formula_20\".\n\nLet formula_21 denote the choice set and let the relevant parameter be formula_22. Letting formula_23 denote the parameterized objective function, the value function formula_17 and the optimal choice correspondence (set-valued function) formula_25 are given by:\n\n\"Envelope theorems\" describe sufficient conditions for the value function formula_17 to be differentiable in the parameter formula_29 and describe its derivative as\n\nwhere formula_31 denotes the partial derivative of formula_32 with respect to formula_29. Namely, the derivative of the value function with respect to the parameter equals the partial derivative of the objective function with respect to formula_29 holding the maximizer fixed at its optimal level. (The term derives from describing the graph of formula_17 as the \"upper envelope\" of the graphs of the parameterized family of functions formula_36.)\n\nTraditional envelope theorem derivations use the first-order condition for (1), which requires that the choice set formula_21 have the convex and topological structure, and the objective function formula_32 be differentiable in the variable formula_6. (The argument is that changes in the maximizer have only a \"second-order effect\" at the optimum and so can be ignored.) However, in many applications such as the analysis of incentive constraints in contract theory and game theory, nonconvex production problems, and \"monotone\" or \"robust\" comparative statics, the choice sets and objective functions generally lack the topological and convexity properties required by the traditional envelope theorems.\n\nPaul Milgrom and Segal (2002) observe that the traditional envelope formula holds for optimization problems with arbitrary choice sets at any differentiability point of the value function, provided that the objective function is differentiable in the parameter:\n\nTheorem 1: Let formula_40 and formula_41. If both formula_42 and formula_43 exist, the envelope formula (3) holds.\n\nProof: (1) implies that for formula_44,\n\nUnder the assumptions, the objective function of the displayed maximization problem is differentiable at formula_46, and the first-order condition for this maximization is exactly (3). Q.E.D.\n\nWhile differentiability of the value function in general requires strong assumptions, in many applications weaker conditions such as absolute continuity, differentiability almost everywhere, or left- and right-differentiability, suffice. In particular, Milgrom and Segal 's (2002) Theorem 2 offers a sufficient condition for formula_17 to be absolutely continuous, which means that it is differentiable almost everywhere and can be represented as an integral of its derivative:\n\nTheorem 2: Suppose that formula_48 is absolutely continuous for all formula_49. Suppose also that there exists an integrable function formula_50 formula_51 formula_52 such that formula_53 for all formula_49 and almost all formula_22. Then formula_17 is absolutely continuous. Suppose, in addition, that formula_48 is differentiable for all formula_49, and that formula_59 almost everywhere on formula_60. Then for any selection formula_61,\n\nProof: Using (1), observe that for any formula_63 with formula_64,\n\nThis implies that formula_17 is absolutely continuous. Therefore, formula_17 is differentiable almost everywhere, and using (3) yields (4). Q.E.D.\n\nThis result dispels the common misconception that nice behavior of the value function requires correspondingly nice behavior of the maximizer. Theorem 2 ensures the absolute continuity of the value function even though the maximizer may be discontinuous. In a similar vein, Milgrom and Segal's (2002) Theorem 3 implies that the value function must be differentiable at formula_68 and hence satisfy the envelope formula (3) when the family formula_36 is equi-differentiable at formula_70 and formula_71 is single-valued and continuous at formula_68, even if the maximizer is not differentiable at formula_73 (e.g., if formula_74 is described by a set of inequality constraints and the set of binding constraints changes at formula_73).\n\nTheorem 1 implies Hotelling's lemma at any differentiability point of the profit function, and Theorem 2 implies the producer surplus formula. Formally, let formula_76 denote the profit function of a price-taking firm with production set formula_77 facing prices formula_78, and let formula_79 denote the firm's supply function, i.e.,\n\nLet formula_81 (the price of good formula_82) and fix the other goods' prices at formula_83. Applying Theorem 1 to formula_84 yields formula_85 (the firm's optimal supply of good formula_82). Applying Theorem 2 (whose assumptions are verified when formula_87 is restricted to a bounded interval) yields\n\ni.e. the producer surplus formula_89 can be obtained by integrating under the firm's supply curve for good formula_82.\n\nConsider an agent whose utility function formula_91 over outcomes formula_92 depends on his type formula_22. Let formula_94 represent the \"menu\" of possible outcomes the agent could obtain in the mechanism by sending different messages. The agent's equilibrium utility formula_95 in the mechanism is then given by (1), and the set formula_96 of the mechanism's equilibrium outcomes is given by (2). Any selection formula_61 is a choice rule implemented by the mechanism. Suppose that the agent's utility function formula_91 is differentiable and absolutely continuous in formula_29 for all formula_100, and that formula_101 is integrable on formula_60. Then Theorem 2 implies that the agent's equilibrium utility formula_17 in any mechanism implementing a given choice rule formula_104 must satisfy the integral condition (4).\n\nThe integral condition (4) is a key step in the analysis of mechanism design problems with continuous type spaces. In particular, in Myerson's (1981) analysis of single-item auctions, the outcome from the viewpoint of one bidder can be described as formula_105, where formula_106 is the bidder's probability of receiving the object and formula_107 is his expected payment, and the bidder's expected utility takes the form formula_108. In this case, letting formula_109 denote the bidder's lowest possible type, the integral condition (4) for the bidder's equilibrium expected utility formula_17 takes the form\n\n(This equation can be interpreted as the producer surplus formula for the firm whose production technology for converting numeraire formula_107 into probability formula_106 of winning the object is defined by the auction and which resells the object at a fixed price formula_29). This condition in turn yields Myerson's (1981) celebrated revenue equivalence theorem: the expected revenue generated in an auction in which bidders have independent private values is fully determined by the bidders' probabilities formula_115 of getting the object for all types formula_29 as well as by the expected payoffs formula_117 of the bidders' lowest types. Finally, this condition is a key step in Myerson's (1981) of optimal auctions.\n\nFor other applications of the envelope theorem to mechanism design see Mirrlees (1971), Holmstrom (1979), Laffont and Maskin (1980), Riley and Samuelson (1981), Fudenberg and Tirole (1991), and Williams (1999). While these authors derived and exploited the envelope theorem by restricting attention to (piecewise) continuously differentiable choice rules or even narrower classes, it may sometimes be optimal to implement a choice rule that is not piecewise continuously differentiable. (One example is the class of trading problems with linear utility described in chapter 6.5 of Myerson (1991).) Note that the integral condition (3) still holds in this setting and implies such important results as Holmstrom's lemma (Holmstrom, 1979), Myerson's lemma (Myerson, 1981), the revenue equivalence theorem (for auctions), the Green–Laffont–Holmstrom theorem (Green and Laffont, 1979; Holmstrom, 1979), the Myerson–Satterthwaite inefficiency theorem (Myerson and Satterthwaite, 1983), the Jehiel–Moldovanu impossibility theorems (Jehiel and Moldovanu, 2001), the McAfee–McMillan weak-cartels theorem (McAfee and McMillan, 1992), and Weber's martingale theorem (Weber, 1983), etc. The details of these applications are provided in Chapter 3 of Milgrom (2004), who offers an elegant and unifying framework in auction and mechanism design analysis mainly based on the envelope theorem and other familiar techniques and concepts in demand theory.\n\nFor a multidimensional parameter space formula_118, Theorem\n1 can be applied to partial and directional derivatives of the value\nfunction. If both the objective function formula_32 and the value function formula_17 are\n(totally) differentiable in formula_29, Theorem 1 implies the envelope formula for\ntheir gradients: formula_122\nfor each formula_44. While total differentiability of\nthe value function may not be easy to ensure, Theorem 2 can be still applied\nalong any smooth path connecting two parameter values formula_73 and formula_29.\nNamely, suppose that functions formula_48 are differentiable for all formula_127 with formula_128 for all formula_129 formula_130. A\nsmooth path from formula_73 to formula_29 is described by a differentiable mapping formula_133 with a bounded derivative, such\nthat formula_134 and formula_135.\nTheorem 2 implies that for any such smooth path, the change of the value\nfunction can be expressed as the path integral of the partial gradient formula_136 of the objective function along the path:\n\nIn particular, for formula_68, this establishes that cyclic path integrals\nalong any smooth path formula_139 must be zero:\n\nThis \"integrability condition\" plays an important role in mechanism design with multidimensional types, constraining what kind of choice rules formula_104 can be sustained by mechanism-induced menus formula_94. In application to producer theory, with formula_143 being the firm's production vector and formula_144 being the price vector, formula_145, and the integrability condition says that any rationalizable supply function formula_104 must satisfy\n\nWhen formula_104 is continuously differentiable, this integrability condition is equivalent to the symmetry of the substitution matrix formula_149. (In consumer theory, the same argument applied to the expenditure minimization problem yields symmetry of the Slutsky matrix.)\n\nSuppose now that the feasible set formula_150 depends on the parameter, i.e.,\n\nwhere formula_153 for some formula_154\n\nSuppose that formula_21 is a convex set, formula_32 and formula_157 are concave in formula_6, and there exists formula_159 such that formula_160 for all formula_161. Under these assumptions, it is well known that the above constrained optimization program can be represented as a saddle-point problem for the Lagrangian formula_162, where formula_163 is the vector of Lagrange multipliers chosen by the adversary to minimize the Lagrangian. This allows the application of Milgrom and Segal's (2002, Theorem 4) envelope theorem for saddle-point problems, under the additional assumptions that formula_21 is a compact set in a normed linear space, formula_32 and formula_157 are continuous in formula_6, and formula_31 and formula_169 are continuous in formula_170. In particular, letting formula_171 denote the Lagrangian's saddle point for parameter value formula_29, the theorem implies that formula_17 is absolutely continuous and satisfies\n\nFor the special case in which formula_175 is independent of formula_29, formula_177, and formula_178, the formula implies that formula_179 for a.e. formula_29. That is, the Lagrange multiplier formula_181 on the constraint is its \"shadow price\" in the optimization program.\n\nMilgrom and Segal (2002) demonstrate that the generalized version of the envelope theorems can also be applied to convex programming, continuous optimization problems, saddle-point problems, and optimal stopping problems.\n\n"}

{"id": "1335092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1335092", "title": "Insolvency", "text": "Insolvency\n\nInsolvency is the state of being unable to pay the money owed, by a person or company, on time; those in a state of insolvency are said to be \"insolvent\". There are two forms: cash-flow insolvency and balance-sheet insolvency.\n\nCash-flow insolvency is when a person or company has enough assets to pay what is owed, but does not have the appropriate form of payment. For example, a person may own a large house and a valuable car, but not have enough liquid assets to pay a debt when it falls due. Cash-flow insolvency can usually be resolved by negotiation. For example, the bill collector may wait until the car is sold and the debtor agrees to pay a penalty.\n\nBalance-sheet insolvency is when a person or company does not have enough assets to pay all of their debts. The person or company might enter bankruptcy, but not necessarily. Once a loss is accepted by all parties, negotiation is often able to resolve the situation without bankruptcy.\n\nA company that is balance-sheet insolvent may still have enough cash to pay its next bill on time. However, most laws will not let the company pay that bill unless it will directly help all their creditors. For example, an insolvent farmer may be allowed to hire people to help harvest the crop, because \"not\" harvesting and selling the crop would be even \"worse\" for his creditors.\n\nIt has been suggested that the speaker or writer should either say technical insolvency or actual insolvency in order to always be clear - where technical insolvency is a synonym for balance sheet insolvency, which means that its liabilities are greater than its assets, and actual insolvency is a synonym for the first definition of insolvency (\"Insolvency is the inability of a debtor to pay their debt.\").\n\nWhile technical insolvency is a synonym for balance-sheet insolvency, cash-flow insolvency and actual insolvency are not synonyms. The term \"cash-flow insolvent\" carries a strong (but perhaps not absolute) connotation that the debtor is balance-sheet solvent, whereas the term \"actually insolvent\" does not.\n\nCash-flow insolvency involves a lack of liquidity to pay debts as they fall due.\n\nBalance sheet insolvency involves having negative net assets—where liabilities exceed assets. Insolvency is not a synonym for bankruptcy, which is a determination of insolvency made by a court of law with resulting legal orders intended to resolve the insolvency.\n\nAccounting insolvency happens when total liabilities exceed total assets (negative net worth).\n\nThe principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business debt restructuring practices no longer rests on the liquidation and elimination of insolvent entities but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing financial distress so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of their business. This is known as business turnaround or business recovery. Implementing a business turnaround may take many forms, including keep and restructure, sale as a going concern, or wind-down and exit. In some jurisdictions, it is an offence under the insolvency laws for a corporation to continue in business while insolvent. In others (like the United States with its Chapter 11 provisions), the business may continue under a declared protective arrangement while alternative options to achieve recovery are worked out. Increasingly, legislatures have favored alternatives to winding up companies for good.\n\nIt can be, in several jurisdictions, grounds for a civil action or even an offence, to continue to pay some creditors in preference to other creditors once a state of insolvency is reached.\n\nDebt restructurings are typically handled by professional insolvency and restructuring practitioners, and are usually less expensive and a preferable alternative to bankruptcy.\n\nDebt restructuring is a process that allows a private or public company - or a sovereign entity - facing cash flow problems and financial distress, to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent debts in order to improve or restore liquidity and rehabilitate so that it can continue its operations.\n\nAlthough the term \"bankrupt\" may be used referring to a government, sovereign states do not go bankrupt. This is so because bankruptcy is governed by national law; there exists no entity to take over such a government and distribute assets to creditors. Governments \"can\" be insolvent in terms of not having money to pay obligations when they are due. If a government does not meet an obligation, it is in \"default\". As governments are sovereign entities, persons who hold debt of the government cannot seize the assets of the government to re-pay the debt. The recourse for the creditor is to request to be repaid at least some of what is owed. However, in most cases, debt in default is refinanced by further borrowing or monetized by issuing more currency (which typically results in inflation and may result in hyperinflation).\n\nInsolvency regimes around the world have evolved in very different ways, with laws focusing on different strategies for dealing with the insolvent. The outcome of an insolvent restructuring can be very different depending on the laws of the state in which the insolvency proceeding is run, and in many cases different stakeholders in a company may hold the advantage in different jurisdictions.\n\nIn Australia Corporate insolvency is governed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Companies can be put into Voluntary Administration, Creditors Voluntary Liquidation & Court Liquidation. Secured creditors with registered charges are able to appoint Receivers and Receivers & Managers depending on their charge.\n\nIn Canada, bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. An alternative regime is available to larger companies (or affiliated groups) under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act, where total debts exceed $5 million.\n\nIn India, bankruptcy and insolvency are generally regulated by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016.The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) is the regulator for overseeing insolvency \"proceedings\" and entities like Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPA), Insolvency Professionals (IP) and Information Utilities (IU) in India.\n\nIn South Africa, owners of businesses that had at any stage traded insolvently (i.e. that had a balance-sheet insolvency) become personally liable for the business' debts. Trading insolvently is often regarded as normal business practice in South Africa, as long as the business is able to fulfill its debt obligations when they fall due.\n\nUnder Swiss law, insolvency or foreclosure may lead to the seizure and auctioning off of assets (generally in the case of private individuals) or to bankruptcy proceedings (generally in the case of registered commercial entities).\n\nTurkish insolvency law is regulated by Enforcement And Bankruptcy Law (Code No: 2004, Original Name: İcra ve İflas Kanunu). Main concept of the insolvency law is very similar to Swiss and German insolvency laws. Enforcement methods are realizing pledged property, seizure of assets and bankruptcy.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term bankruptcy is reserved for individuals. Insolvency is defined both in terms of cash flow and in terms of balance sheet in the UK Insolvency Act 1986, Section 123, which reads in part:\n\nA company which is insolvent may be put into liquidation (sometimes referred to as winding-up). The directors and shareholders can instigate the liquidation process without court involvement by a shareholder resolution and the appointment of a licensed Insolvency Practitioner as liquidator. However, the liquidation will not be effective legally without the convening of a meeting of creditors who have the opportunity to appoint a liquidator of their own choice. This process is known as creditors voluntary liquidation (CVL), as opposed to members voluntary liquidation (MVL) which is for solvent companies. Alternatively, a creditor can petition the court for a winding-up order which, if granted, will place the company into what is called compulsory liquidation or winding up by the court. The liquidator realises the assets of the company and distributes funds realised to creditors according to their priorities, after the deduction of costs. In the case of Sole Trader Insolvency, the insolvency options include Individual Voluntary Arrangements and Bankruptcy.\n\nIt can be a civil and even a criminal offence for directors to allow a company to continue to trade whilst insolvent. However, two new insolvency procedures were introduced by the Insolvency Act 1986 which aim to provide time for the rescue of a company or, at least, its business. These are Administration and Company Voluntary Arrangement:\n\n\nOne particular type of Administration that is becoming more common is called pre pack administration (more information under administration (law)). In this process, immediately after appointment the administrator completes a pre-arranged sale of the company's business, often to its directors or owners. The process can be seen as controversial because the creditors do not have the opportunity to vote against the sale. The rationale behind the device is that the swift sale of the business may be necessary or of benefit to enable a best price to be achieved. If the sale was delayed, creditors would ultimately lose out because the price obtainable for the assets would be reduced.\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned corporate insolvency procedures, a creditor holding security over an asset of the company may have the power to appoint an insolvency practitioner as administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver. The process, latterly known as administrative receivership or, in Scotland, receivership, has existed for many years and has often resulted in a successful rescue of a company's business via a sale, but not of the company itself. Since the introduction of the collective insolvency procedure of Administration in 1986, the legislators have decided to set a shelf life on the administrative receivership or, in Scotland, receivership procedure and it is no longer possible to appoint an administrative receiver or, in Scotland, receiver under security created after 15 September 2003.\n\nIn individual cases the bankruptcy estate is dealt by an official receiver, appointed by the court. In some cases the file is transferred to RTLU (OR Regional Trustee Liquidator Unit) that will assess your assets and income to see if you can contribute towards paying costs of bankruptcy or even discharge part of your debts.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code, a person is considered to be insolvent when the party has ceased to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business, or cannot pay its debts as they become due, or is insolvent within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code. This is important because certain rights under the code may be invoked against an insolvent party which are otherwise unavailable.\n\nThe United States has established insolvency regimes which aim to protect the insolvent individual or company from the creditors, and balance their respective interests. For example, see Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code. However, some state courts have begun to find individual corporate officers and directors liable for driving a company deeper into bankruptcy, under the legal theory of \"deepening insolvency\".\n\nIn determining whether a gift or a payment to a creditor is an unlawful preference, the date of the insolvency, rather than the date of the legally declared bankruptcy, will usually be the primary consideration.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1910981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910981", "title": "Marine protected area", "text": "Marine protected area\n\nMarine protected areas (MPA) are protected areas of seas, oceans, estuaries or large lakes. These marine areas can come in many forms ranging from wildlife refuges to research facilities. MPAs restrict human activity for a conservation purpose, typically to protect natural or cultural resources. Such marine resources are protected by local, state, territorial, native, regional, national, or international authorities and differ substantially among and between nations. This variation includes different limitations on development, fishing practices, fishing seasons and catch limits, moorings and bans on removing or disrupting marine life. In some situations (such as with the Phoenix Islands Protected Area), MPAs also provide revenue for countries, potentially equal to the income that they would have if they were to grant companies permissions to fish.\n\nOn 28 October 2016 in Hobart, Australia, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources agreed to establish the first Antarctic and largest marine protected area in the world encompassing 1.55 million km (600,000 sq mi) in the Ross Sea. Other large MPAs are in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans, in certain exclusive economic zones of Australia and overseas territories of France, the United Kingdom and the United States, with major ( or larger) new or expanded MPAs by these nations since 2012—such as Natural Park of the Coral Sea, Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area. When counted with MPAs of all sizes from many other countries, as of August 2016 there are more than 13,650 MPAs, encompassing 2.07% of the world's oceans, with half of that area – encompassing 1.03% of the world's oceans – receiving complete \"no-take\" designation.\n\n\"MPA\" is an umbrella term for protected areas that includes some area of marine landscape and/or biodiversity. The IUCN defines a marine protected area as:\n\"Any area of the intertidal or subtidal terrain, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment.\"An alternative is \"a clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated, and managed through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\".\n\nUnited States Executive Order 13158 in May 2000 established MPAs, defining them as;\"Any area of the marine environment that has been reserved by federal, state, tribal, territorial, or local laws or regulations to provide lasting protection for part or all of the natural and cultural resources therein.\"The Convention on Biological Diversity defined the broader term of \"marine and coastal protected area\" (MCPA);\"Any defined area within or adjacent to the marine environment, together with its overlying water and associated flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which has been reserved by legislation or other effective means, including custom, with the effect that its marine and/or coastal biodiversity enjoys a higher level of protection than its surroundings.\"\n\nSeveral types of compliant MPA can be distinguished:\n\nIUCN offered seven categories of protected area, based on management objectives and four broad governance types.\n\nRelated protected area categories include the following;\n\n\nWhile \"area\" refers to a single contiguous location, terms such as \"network\", \"system\", and \"region\" that group MPAs are not always consistently employed.\"System\" is more often used to refer to an individual MPA, whereas \"region\" is defined by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre as:\n\"A collection of individual MPAs operating cooperatively, at various spatial scales and with a range of protection levels that are designed to meet objectives that a single reserve cannot achieve.\"\n\nAt the 2004 Convention on Biological Diversity, the agency agreed to use \"network\" on a global level, while adopting \"system\" for national and regional levels. The \"network\" is a mechanism to establish regional and local systems, but carries no authority or mandate, leaving all activity within the \"system\".\n\n\"No take zones\" (NTZs), are areas designated in a number of the world's MPAs, where all forms of exploitation are prohibited and severely limits human activities. These no take zones can cover an entire MPA, or specific portions. For example, the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, the world's largest MPA (and largest protected area of any type, land or sea), is a 100% no take zone.\n\nRelated terms include; \"specially protected area\" (SPA), \"Special Area of Conservation\" (SAC), the United Kingdom's \"marine conservation zones\" (MCZs), or \"area of special conservation\" (ASC) etc. which each provide specific restrictions.\n\nStressors that affect oceans include \"the impact of extractive industries, localised pollution, and changes to its chemistry (ocean acidification) resulting from elevated carbon dioxide levels, due to our emissions\". MPAs have been cited as the ocean's single greatest hope for increasing the resilience of the marine environment to such stressors. Well-designed and managed MPAs developed with input and support from interested stakeholders can conserve biodiversity and protect and restore fisheries.\n\nMPAs can help sustain local economies by supporting fisheries and tourism. For example, Apo Island in the Philippines made protected one quarter of their reef, allowing fish to recover, jumpstarting their economy. This was shown in the film, \"Resources at Risk: Philippine Coral Reef\". A 2016 report by the Center for Development and Strategy found that programs like the United States National Marine Sanctuary system can develop considerable economic benefits for communities through Public–private partnerships.\n\nTypical MPAs restrict fishing, oil and gas mining and/or tourism. Other restrictions may limit the use of ultrasonic devices like sonar (which may confuse the guidance system of cetaceans), development, construction and the like. Some fishing restrictions include \"no-take\" zones, which means that no fishing is allowed. Less than 1% of US MPAs are no-take.\n\nShip transit can also be restricted or banned, either as a preventive measure or to avoid direct disturbance to individual species. The degree to which environmental regulations affect shipping varies according to whether MPAs are located in territorial waters, exclusive economic zones, or the high seas. The law of the sea regulates these limits.\n\nMost MPAs have been located in territorial waters, where the appropriate government can enforce them. However, MPAs have been established in exclusive economic zones and in international waters. For example, Italy, France and Monaco in 1999 jointly established a cetacean sanctuary in the Ligurian Sea named the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals. This sanctuary includes both national and international waters. Both the CBD and IUCN recommended a variety of management systems for use in a protected area system. They advocated that MPAs be seen as one of many \"nodes\" in a network of protected areas. The following are the most common management systems:\n\nSeasonal and temporary management—Activities, most critically fishing, are restricted seasonally or temporarily, e.g., to protect spawning/nursing grounds or to let a rapidly reducing species recover.\n\nMultiple-use MPAs—These are the most common and arguably the most effective. These areas employ two or more protections. The most important sections get the highest protection, such as a no take zone and are surrounded with areas of lesser protections.\n\nCommunity involvement and related approaches—Community-managed MPAs empower local communities to operate partially or completely independent of the governmental jurisdictions they occupy. Empowering communities to manage resources can lower conflict levels and enlist the support of diverse groups that rely on the resource such as subsistence and commercial fishers, scientists, recreation, tourism businesses, youths and others.\n\nMarine Protected Area Networks or MPA networks have been defined as \"A group of MPAs that interact with one another ecologically and/or socially form a network\".\n\nThese networks are intended to connect individuals and MPAs and promote education and cooperation among various administrations and user groups. \"MPA networks are, from the perspective of resource users, intended to address both environmental and socio-economic needs, complementary ecological and social goals and designs need greater research and policy support\".\n\nFilipino communities connect with one another to share information about MPAs, creating a larger network through the social communities' support. Emerging or established MPA networks can be found in Australia, Belize, the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Mexico.\n\nThe 17th International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) General Assembly in San Jose, California, the 19th IUCN assembly and the fourth World Parks Congress all proposed to centralise the establishment of protected areas. The World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 called for The Evian agreement, signed by G8 Nations in 2003, agreed to these terms. The Durban Action Plan, developed in 2003, called for regional action and targets to establish a network of protected areas by 2010 within the jurisdiction of regional environmental protocols.It recommended establishing protected areas for 20 to 30% of the world's oceans by the goal date of 2012. The Convention on Biological Diversity considered these recommendations and recommended requiring countries to set up marine parks controlled by a central organization before merging them. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to the terms laid out by the convention, and in 2004, its member nations committed to the following targets;\n\n\"The establishment by 2010 of terrestrial and by 2012 for marine areas of comprehensive, effectively managed, and ecologically representative national and regional systems of protected areas that collectively, inter alia through a global network, contribute to achieving the three objectives of the Convention and the 2010 target to significantly reduce the current late of biodiversity loss at the global, regional, national, and sub-national levels and contribute to poverty reduction and the pursuit of sustainable development.\"\n\nThe UN later endorsed another decision, Decision VII/15, in 2006:\n\nOn 7 April 1982, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CAMLR Convention) came into force after discussions began in 1975 between parties of the then-current Antarctic Treaty to limit large-scale exploitation of krill by commercial fisheries. The Convention bound contracting nations to abide by previously agreed upon Antarctic territorial claims and peaceful use of the region while protecting ecosystem integrity south of the Antarctic Convergence and 60 S latitude. In so doing, it also established a commission of the original signatories and acceding parties called the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to advance these aims through protection, scientific study, and rational use, such as harvesting, of those marine resources. Though separate, the Antarctic Treaty and CCAMLR, make up part the broader system of international agreements called the Antarctic Treaty System. Since 1982, the CCAMLR meets annually to implement binding conservations measures like the creation of 'protected areas' at the suggestion of the convention's scientific committee.\n\nIn 2009, the CCAMLR created the first 'high-seas' MPA entirely within international waters over the southern shelf of the South Orkney Islands. This area encompasses and all fishing activity including transhipment, and dumping or discharge of waste is prohibited with the exception of scientific research endeavors. On 28 October 2016, the CCAMLR, composed of 24 member countries and the European Union at the time, agreed to establish the world's largest marine park encompassing 1.55 million km (600,000 sq mi) in the Ross Sea after several years of failed negotiations. Establishment of the Ross Sea MPA required unanimity of the commission members and enforcement will begin in December 2017. However, due to a sunset provision inserted into the proposal, the new marine park will only be in force for 35 years.\n\nMany countries have established national targets, accompanied by action plans and implementations. The UN Council identified the need for countries to collaborate with each other to establish effective regional conservation plans. Some national targets are listed in the table below\n\nThe marine protected area network is still in its infancy. As of October 2010, approximately 6,800 MPAs had been established, covering 1.17% of global ocean area. Protected areas covered 2.86% of exclusive economic zones (EEZs). MPAs covered 6.3% of territorial seas. Many prohibit the use of harmful fishing techniques yet only 0.01% of the ocean's area is designated as a \"no take zone\". This coverage is far below the projected goal of 20%-30% Those targets have been questioned mainly due to the cost of managing protected areas and the conflict that protections have generated with human demand for marine goods and services.\n\nThe Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area is a marine protected area around the Cape Peninsula, in the vicinity of Cape Town, South Africa It was proclaimed in Government Gazette No. 26431 of 4 June 2004 in terms of the Marine Natural Resources Act, 18 of 1998.\n\nThe MPA is of value for conservation of a wide range of endemic species, and has considerable economic value as a tourist destination. It encloses a large number of recreational dive sites visited by local residents and tourists from further afield. The shark and whale watching tourist industries are also represented, and there are several popular surf breaks. The MPA includes controlled zones where extractive activities are allowed under permit, and smaller no-take zones. The MPA is administrated by the Table Mountain National Park, a branch of SANParks. \n\nThe marine ecology is unusually varied for an area of this size, as a result of the meeting of two major oceanic water masses near Cape Point, and the park extends into two coastal marine bioregions. The ecology of the west or \"Atlantic Seaboard\" side of the park is noticeably different in character and biodiversity to that of the east, or \"False Bay\" side. Both sides are classified as temperate waters, but there is a significant difference in average temperature, with the Atlantic side being noticeably colder.\n\nThe MPA contains culturally significant fish traps, historicalwrecks and traditional fishing communities, and is also important for commercial fisheries. Part of the West Coast rock lobster industry takes place within the MPA – as well as recreational and subsistence fishers, and an illegal poaching industry mostly targeting abalone, rock lobster and territorial linefish from the no-take zones.\n\nThe Greater Caribbean subdivision encompasses an area of about of ocean and 38 nations. The area includes island countries like the Bahamas and Cuba, and the majority of Central America. The Convention for Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (better known as the Cartagena Convention) was established in 1983. Protocols involving protected areas were ratified in 1990. As of 2008, the region hosted about 500 MPAs. Coral reefs are the best represented.\n\nTwo networks are under development, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (a long barrier reef that borders the coast of much of Central America), and the \"Islands in the Stream\" program (covering the Gulf of Mexico).\n\nSoutheast Asia is a global epicenter for marine diversity. 12% of its coral reefs are in MPAs. The Philippines have some the world's best coral reefs and protect them to attract international tourism. Most of the Philippines' MPAs are established to secure protection for its coral reef and sea grass habitats. Indonesia has MPAs designed for tourism and relies on tourism as a main source of income.\n\nThe Philippines host one of the most highly biodiverse regions, with 464 reef-building coral species. Due to overfishing, destructive fishing techniques, and rapid coastal development, these are in rapid decline. The country has established some 600 MPAs. However, the majority are poorly enforced and are highly ineffective. However, some have positively impacted reef health, increased fish biomass, decreased coral bleaching and increased yields in adjacent fisheries. One notable example is the MPA surrounding Apo Island.\n\nLatin America has designated one large MPA system. As of 2008, 0.5% of its marine environment was protected, mostly through the use of small, multiple-use MPAs.\n\nThe South Pacific network ranges from Belize to Chile. Governments in the region adopted the Lima convention and action plan in 1981. An MPA-specific protocol was ratified in 1989. The permanent commission on the exploitation and conservation on the marine resources of the South Pacific promotes the exchange of studies and information among participants.\n\nThe region is currently running one comprehensive cross-national program, the Tropical Eastern Pacific Marine Corridor Network, signed in April 2004. The network covers about .\n\nOne alternative to imposing MPAs on an indigenous population is through the use of Indigenous Protected Areas, such as those in Australia.\n\nThe North Pacific network covers the western coasts of Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. The \"Antigua Convention\" and an action plan for the north Pacific region were adapted in 2002. Participant nations manage their own national systems. In 2010-2011, the State of California completed hearings and actions via the state Department of Fish and Game to establish new MPAs.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed a proclamation on September 25, 2014, designating the world's largest marine reserve. The proclamation expanded the existing Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, one of the world's most pristine tropical marine environments, to six times its current size, encompassing of protected area around these islands. Expanding the Monument protected the area's unique deep coral reefs and seamounts.\nIn April 2009, the US established a United States National System of Marine Protected Areas, which strengthens the protection of US ocean, coastal and Great Lakes resources. These large-scale MPAs should balance \"the interests of conservationists, fishers, and the public.\" As of 2009, 225 MPAs participated in the national system. Sites work together toward common national and regional conservation goals and priorities. NOAA's national marine protected areas center maintains a comprehensive inventory of all 1,600+ MPAs within the US exclusive economic zone. Most US MPAs.allow some type of extractive use. Fewer than 1% of U.S. waters prohibit all extractive activities.\n\nIn 1981 Olympic National Park became a marine protected area. The total protected site area is . 173.2 km of the area was an MPA. The national system is a mechanism to foster MPA collaboration. Sites that meet pertinent criteria are eligible to join the national system. Four entry criteria govern admission:\nIn 1999, California adopted the Marine Life Protection Act, establishing the first state law requiring a comprehensive, science-based MPA network. The state created the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The MLPA Blue Ribbon Task Force and stakeholder and scientific advisory groups ensure that the process uses the science and public participation.\n\nThe MLPA Initiative established a plan to create California's statewide MPA network by 2011 in several steps. The Central Coast step was successfully completed in September, 2007. The North Central Coast step was completed in 2010. The South Coast and North Coast steps were expected to go into effect in 2012.\n\nIn exchange for some of its national debt being written off, the Seychelles designates two new marine protected areas in the Indian Ocean, covering about . It is the result of a financial deal, brokered in 2016 by The Nature Conservancy.\n\nThere are a number of marine protected areas around the coastline of the United Kingdom, known as Marine Conservation Zones in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, Marine Protection Areas in Scotland. They are to be found in inshore and offshore waters.\n\nThe United Kingdom is also creating marine protected reserves around several British Overseas Territories.\nThe UK is responsible for 6.8 million square kilometres of ocean around the world, larger than all but four other countries.\n\nThe Chagos Marine Protected Area in the Indian Ocean was established in 2010 as a \"no-take-zone\". With a total surface area of , it was the world's largest contiguous marine reserve. In March 2015, the UK announced the creation of a marine reserve around the Pitcairn Islands in the Southern Pacific Ocean to protect its special biodiversity. The area of surpassed the Chagos Marine Protected Area as the world's largest contiguous marine reserve, until the August 2016 expansion of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in the United States to .\n\nIn January 2016, the UK government announced the intention to create a marine protected area around Ascension Island. The protected area will be , half of which will be closed to fishing.\n\nThe Natura 2000 ecological MPA network in the European Union included MPAs in the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea. The member states had to define NATURA 2000 areas at sea in their Exclusive Economic Zone.\n\nTwo assessments, conducted thirty years apart, of three Mediterranean MPAs, demonstrate that proper protection allows commercially valuable and slow-growing red coral (Corallium rubrum) to produce large colonies in shallow water of less than . Shallow-water colonies outside these decades-old MPAs are typically very small. The MPAs are Banyuls, Carry-le-Rouet and Scandola, off the island of Corsica.\n\n\n\n\nManagers and scientists use geographic information systems and remote sensing to map and analyze MPAs. NOAA Coastal Services Center compiled an \"Inventory of GIS-Based Decision-Support Tools for MPAs.\" The report focuses on GIS tools with the highest utility for MPA processes. Remote sensing uses advances in aerial photography image capture, pop-up archival satellite tags, satellite imagery, acoustic data, and radar imagery. Mathematical models that seek to reflect the complexity of the natural setting may assist in planning harvesting strategies and sustaining fishing grounds.\n\nCoral reef systems have been in decline worldwide. Causes include overfishing, pollution and ocean acidification. As of 2013 30% of the world's reefs were severely damaged. Approximately 60% will be lost by 2030 without enhanced protection. Marine reserves with \"no take zones\" are the most effective form of protection. Only about 0.01% of the world's coral reefs are inside effective MPAs.\n\nMPAs can be an effective tool to maintain fish populations; see refuge (ecology). The general concept is to create overpopulation within the MPA. The fish expand into the surrounding areas to reduce crowding, increasing the population of unprotected areas. This helps support local fisheries in the surrounding area, while maintaining a healthy population within the MPA. Such MPAs are most commonly used for coral reef ecosystems.\n\nOne example is at Goat Island Bay in New Zealand, established in 1977. Research gathered at Goat Bay documented the spillover effect. \"Spillover and larval export—the drifting of millions of eggs and larvae beyond the reserve—have become central concepts of marine conservation\". This positively impacted commercial fishermen in surrounding areas.\n\nAnother unexpected result of MPAs is their impact on predatory marine species, which in some conditions can increase in population. When this occurs, prey populations decrease. One study showed that in 21 out of 39 cases, \"trophic cascades,\" caused a decrease in herbivores, which led to an increase in the quantity of plant life. (This occurred in the Malindi Kisite and Watamu Marian National Parks in Kenya; the Leigh Marine Reserve in New Zealand; and Brackett's Landing Conservation Area in the US.\n\nBoth CBD and IUCN have criteria for setting up and maintaining MPA networks, which emphasize 4 factors:\n\nMisconceptions about MPAs include the belief that all MPAs are no-take or no-fishing areas. However, less than 1 percent of US waters are no-take areas. MPA activities can include consumption fishing, diving and other activities.\n\nAnother misconception is that most MPAs are federally managed. Instead, MPAs are managed under hundreds of laws and jurisdictions. They can be exist in state, commonwealth, territory and tribal waters.\n\nAnother misconception is that a federal mandate dedicates a set percentage of ocean to MPAs. Instead the mandate requires an evaluation of current MPAs and creates a public resource on current MPAs.\n\nSome existing and proposed MPAs have been criticized by indigenous populations and their supporters, as impinging on land usage rights. For example, the proposed Chagos Protected Area in the Chagos Islands is contested by Chagossians deported from their homeland in 1965 by the British as part of the creation of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). According to WikiLeaks CableGate documents, the UK proposed that the BIOT become a \"marine reserve\" with the aim of preventing the former inhabitants from returning to their lands and to protect the joint UK/US military base on Diego Garcia Island.\n\nOther critiques include: their cost (higher than that of passive management), conflicts with human development goals, inadequate scope to address factors such as climate change and invasive species.\n\nIn 2010, one study found that fish larvae can drift on ocean currents and reseed fish stocks at a distant location. This finding demonstrated that fish populations can be connected to distant locations through the process of larval drift.\n\nThey investigated the yellow tang, because larva of this species stay in the general area of the reef in which they first settle. The tropical yellow tang is heavily fished by the aquarium trade. By the late 1990s, their stocks were collapsing. Nine MPAs were established off the coast of Hawaii to protect them. Larval drift has helped them establish themselves in different locations, and the fishery is recovering. \"We've clearly shown that fish larvae that were spawned inside marine reserves can drift with currents and replenish fished areas long distances away,\" said coauthor Mark Hixon.\n\n\n\n"}

From an accounting stand point, this type of lease (if it fails to meet varied criteria that define a finance lease) results in off balance sheet financing.\n\nThe determination of whether a lease is a finance (also called capital) lease or an operating lease from an accounting point of view is defined in the United States by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS 13). In countries covered by International Financial Reporting Standards, the tests are defined in IAS 17. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) announced the commencement of a joint project to comprehensively reconsider lease accounting. In July 2008, the boards decided to defer any changes to lessor accounting, while continuing with the project for lessee accounting, with the stated intention to recognise an asset and liability for all lessee leases (in essence, eliminating operating lease accounting). This culminated in the issuance of IFRS 16 and FASB Topic 842.

The nearby Babe Ruth Birthplace & Museum remains in existence as a separate museum on Emory Street, two and a half blocks from Camden Station.\n\nA replica of the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Super Bowl V is part of the museum's collection. The original trophy from the Colts' 1971 Super Bowl victory was taken by former owner Carroll Rosenbloom after he traded the Colts for the Los Angeles Rams in 1972. A replica trophy was later made for the Colts, but in the Midnight Move of 1984, the team was not allowed to keep the trophy. That trophy stayed in the city of Baltimore's possession, and was placed in the Sports Legends Museum.\n\n\n"}

High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as statistical pattern learning. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a database), deriving patterns within the structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interest. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (\"i.e.\", learning relations between named entities).\n\nText analysis involves information retrieval, lexical analysis to study word frequency distributions, pattern recognition, tagging/annotation, information extraction, data mining techniques including link and association analysis, visualization, and predictive analytics. The overarching goal is, essentially, to turn text into data for analysis, via application of natural language processing (NLP) and analytical methods.\n\nA typical application is to scan a set of documents written in a natural language and either model the document set for predictive classification purposes or populate a database or search index with the information extracted.\n\nThe term text analytics describes a set of linguistic, statistical, and machine learning techniques that model and structure the information content of textual sources for business intelligence, exploratory data analysis, research, or investigation. The term is roughly synonymous with text mining; indeed, Ronen Feldman modified a 2000 description of \"text mining\" in 2004 to describe \"text analytics\". The latter term is now used more frequently in business settings while \"text mining\" is used in some of the earliest application areas, dating to the 1980s, notably life-sciences research and government intelligence.\n\nThe term text analytics also describes that application of text analytics to respond to business problems, whether independently or in conjunction with query and analysis of fielded, numerical data. It is a truism that 80 percent of business-relevant information originates in unstructured form, primarily text. These techniques and processes discover and present knowledge – facts, business rules, and relationships – that is otherwise locked in textual form, impenetrable to automated processing.\n\nSubtasks—components of a larger text-analytics effort—typically include:\n\n\nText mining technology is now broadly applied to a wide variety of government, research, and business needs. All three groups may use text mining for records management and searching documents relevant to their daily activities. Legal professionals may use text mining for e-discovery. Governments and military groups use text mining for national security and intelligence purposes. Scientific researchers incorporate text mining approaches into efforts to organize large sets of text data (i.e., addressing the problem of unstructured data), to determine ideas communicated through text (e.g., sentiment analysis in social media) and to support scientific discovery in fields such as the life sciences and bioinformatics. In business, applications are used to support competitive intelligence and automated ad placement, among numerous other activities.\n\nMany text mining software packages are marketed for security applications, especially monitoring and analysis of online plain text sources such as Internet news, blogs, etc. for national security purposes. It is also involved in the study of text encryption/decryption.\n\nA range of text mining applications in the biomedical literature has been described, including computational approaches to assist with studies in protein docking, protein interactions, and protein-disease associations. In addition, with large patient textual datasets in the clinical field, datasets of demographic information in population studies and adverse event reports, text mining can facilitate clinical studies and precision medicine. Text mining algorithms can facilitate the stratification and indexing of specific clinical events in large patient textual datasets of symptoms, side effects, and comorbidities from electronic health records, event reports, and reports from specific diagnostic tests. One online text mining application in the biomedical literature is PubGene, a publicly accessible search engine that combines biomedical text mining with network visualization. GoPubMed is a knowledge-based search engine for biomedical texts. Text mining techniques also enable us to extract unknown knowledge from unstructured documents in the clinical domain\n\nText mining methods and software is also being researched and developed by major firms, including IBM and Microsoft, to further automate the mining and analysis processes, and by different firms working in the area of search and indexing in general as a way to improve their results.\nWithin public sector much effort has been concentrated on creating software for tracking and monitoring terrorist activities.\n\nText mining is being used by large media companies, such as the Tribune Company, to clarify information and to provide readers with greater search experiences, which in turn increases site \"stickiness\" and revenue. Additionally, on the back end, editors are benefiting by being able to share, associate and package news across properties, significantly increasing opportunities to monetize content.\n\nText mining is starting to be used in marketing as well, more specifically in analytical customer relationship management. Coussement and Van den Poel (2008)<ref name=\"10.1016/j.im.2008.01.005\"></ref> apply it to improve predictive analytics models for customer churn (customer attrition). Text mining is also being applied in stock returns prediction.\n\nSentiment analysis may involve analysis of movie reviews for estimating how favorable a review is for a movie.\nSuch an analysis may need a labeled data set or labeling of the affectivity of words.\nResources for affectivity of words and concepts have been made for WordNet and ConceptNet, respectively.\n\nText has been used to detect emotions in the related area of affective computing. Text based approaches to affective computing have been used on multiple corpora such as students evaluations, children stories and news stories.\n\nThe issue of text mining is of importance to publishers who hold large databases of information needing indexing for retrieval. This is especially true in scientific disciplines, in which highly specific information is often contained within written text. Therefore, initiatives have been taken such as Nature's proposal for an Open Text Mining Interface (OTMI) and the National Institutes of Health's common Journal Publishing Document Type Definition (DTD) that would provide semantic cues to machines to answer specific queries contained within text without removing publisher barriers to public access.\n\nAcademic institutions have also become involved in the text mining initiative:\n\n\nComputational methods have been developed to assist with information retrieval from scientific literature. Published approaches include methods for searching, determining novelty, and clarifying homonyms among technical reports.\n\nThe automatic analysis of vast textual corpora has created the possibility for scholars to analyze\nmillions of documents in multiple languages with very limited manual intervention. Key enabling technologies have been parsing, machine translation, topic categorization, and machine learning.\nThe automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analyzed by using tools from network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes. This automates the approach introduced by quantitative narrative analysis, whereby subject-verb-object triplets are identified with pairs of actors linked by an action, or pairs formed by actor-object.\n\nContent analysis has been a traditional part of social sciences and media studies for a long time. The automation of content analysis has allowed a \"big data\" revolution to take place in that field, with studies in social media and newspaper content that include millions of news items. Gender bias, readability, content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documents. The analysis of readability, gender bias and topic bias was demonstrated in Flaounas et al. showing how different topics have different gender biases and levels of readability; the possibility to detect mood patterns in a vast population by analyzing Twitter content was demonstrated as well.\n\nText mining computer programs are available from many commercial and open source companies and sources. See List of text mining software.\n\nBecause of a lack of flexibilities in European copyright and database law, the mining of in-copyright works (such as web mining) without the permission of the copyright owner is illegal. In the UK in 2014, on the recommendation of the Hargreaves review the government amended copyright law to allow text mining as a limitation and exception. It was only the second country in the world to do so, following Japan, which introduced a mining-specific exception in 2009. However, owing to the restriction of the Copyright Directive, the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions.\n\nThe European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licenses for Europe. The fact that the focus on the solution to this legal issue was licenses, and not limitations and exceptions to copyright law, led representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.\n\nBy contrast to Europe, the flexible nature of US copyright law, and in particular fair use, means that text mining in America, as well as other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea, is viewed as being legal. As text mining is transformative, meaning that it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one such use being text and data mining.\n\nUntil recently, websites most often used text-based searches, which only found documents containing specific user-defined words or phrases. Now, through use of a semantic web, text mining can find content based on meaning and context (rather than just by a specific word). Additionally, text mining software can be used to build large dossiers of information about specific people and events. For example, large datasets based on data extracted from news reports can be built to facilitate social networks analysis or counter-intelligence. In effect, the text mining software may act in a capacity similar to an intelligence analyst or research librarian, albeit with a more limited scope of analysis. Text mining is also used in some email spam filters as a way of determining the characteristics of messages that are likely to be advertisements or other unwanted material. Text mining plays an important role in determining financial market sentiment.\n\nIncreasing interest is being paid to multilingual data mining: the ability to gain information across languages and cluster similar items from different linguistic sources according to their meaning. Popular text analytics tools includes Accern, Lexalytics, and Repustate. \n\nThe challenge of exploiting the large proportion of enterprise information that originates in \"unstructured\" form has been recognized for decades. It is recognized in the earliest definition of business intelligence (BI), in an October 1958 IBM Journal article by H.P. Luhn, A Business Intelligence System, which describes a system that will:\n\"...utilize data-processing machines for auto-abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles for each of the 'action points' in an organization. Both incoming and internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points.\"\nYet as management information systems developed starting in the 1960s, and as BI emerged in the '80s and '90s as a software category and field of practice, the emphasis was on numerical data stored in relational databases. This is not surprising: text in \"unstructured\" documents is hard to process. The emergence of text analytics in its current form stems from a refocusing of research in the late 1990s from algorithm development to application, as described by Prof. Marti A. Hearst in the paper Untangling Text Data Mining:\n\nFor almost a decade the computational linguistics community has viewed large text collections as a resource to be tapped in order to produce better text analysis algorithms. In this paper, I have attempted to suggest a new emphasis: the use of large online text collections to discover new facts and trends about the world itself. I suggest that to make progress we do not need fully artificial intelligent text analysis; rather, a mixture of computationally-driven and user-guided analysis may open the door to exciting new results.\nHearst's 1999 statement of need fairly well describes the state of text analytics technology and practice a decade later.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2748787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2748787", "title": "Whitfield, Kent", "text": "Whitfield, Kent\n\nWhitfield is an ancient village, civil parish and electoral ward in the English county of Kent. It has a modern counterpart in the large settlement located at the junction of the A2 and A256 roads, some four miles (6.4 km) north of Dover.\n\nThe village itself (Church Whitfield) can claim ancient roots in that evidence of both Roman and Saxon settlements have been unearthed. The village church, dedicated to St Peter, has two Saxon windows, and the bell is from the 13th century, or earlier. St. Peter's Church is a 10th Century Saxon Church largely rebuilt in Norman times, though the church is first mentioned in 762 AD. It was restored and enlarged in 1894.\n\nThere is also an early Congregational Chapel in the village (Chapel Rd) dating to 1781 but rebuilt in 1867. Whitfield also had its own windmill for many years, with a bakery beneath. It was built in about 1755 and was owned by generations of the Cadman family. In 1900 the mill was left to decay and was finally demolished in 1916 though the mill house still stands in Napchester Road.\n\nThe modern Whitfield began to appear when the more affluent citizens of Dover built their homes in \"West Whitfeld\", alongside what was to become the A2 trunk road which bypassed the village. Modern (post-Second World War) development enlarged the new village and in the 1960s Beauxfield was built then extended in the 1980s.\n\nThe 1970s saw with the introduction of Newlands, Cranleigh Drive and Farncombe Way. Again in 2005, the government proposed a maximum of 9,900 new homes to be built on greenfield sites around the village, doubling its size. The \"Whitfield Action Group\" was set up to oppose any large scale developments while accepting natural growth. It was confirmed in February 2010, that this figure will now be 6,000 new homes built.\n\nThe main village of Whitfield along the 'Sandwich Road' has, as amenities, a public house, 'The Archer'; the private members/function hall 'The Whitfield Club' Rolles Court Guest House and the Ramada Dover Hotel (formerly the Dover Motel). There is also a village hall with doctors surgery, vets, café, take aways, hairdresser and the local Post Office. A branch of McDonald's and Esso service station is located near the A2 roundabout at the top of 'Whitfield Hill'. The village's older pub, the Royal Oak, closed in February 2008 and a Marston's Brewery pub/restaurant, the 'Kittiwake', is now open at the junction of Menzies Road/Gordon Road. July 2015 saw the introduction of new KFC, Pets at Home and B & M stores on the ever-expanding Honeywood Retail Park, Honeywood Parkway.\n\nThe village has two schools, both of which also cater for special educational needs: primary and secondary. Whitfield and Aspen School (primary); and Dover Christ Church Academy, formerly Archers Court School.\n\nIn view of its site on the periphery of a town such as Dover, and because of its strategic position on the A2/A256 junction, Whitfield is of importance to businesses. The huge White Cliffs Business Park, covering 272 acres (110 ha) is located at Whitfield and is described as attracting \"… household names and a raft of companies with international pedigrees\".\n\nThe village of Whitfield has grown so that it is now physically connected to urban Dover, Kent, yet it has kept its own identity and sense of place. The central core of modern Whitfield was, however, not the original heart of the village; the original settlement was sited at Church Whitfield to the east. Pineham, located to the east of Church Whitfield is a small rural hamlet that is often considered part of the Whitfield community. It contains a small handful of farms and houses.\n\nChurch Whitfield seems to have originated around a small, enclosed farmstead; archaeological work in the area showed that there was a collection of structures on the site during the early medieval period and evidence of both Roman and Saxon settlements. The Roman road from Dover (Dubris) to Richborough (Rutupiae) runs north-south near Pineham, suggesting that the village developed along its route. The village church, dedicated to St Peter, is testament to this history; the church is a 10th Century Saxon structure largely rebuilt in Norman times, though the church is first mentioned in 762 AD. The building has two Saxon windows, and the bell dates from the 13th century. The village was originally known as 'Bewsfield', which is said to refer to its high and open situation. It is thought that Whitfield began to be called 'Whytefeld' in the mid-seventeenth century.\n\nAt some point in the later medieval period, a new village was formed to the west. This may have been due to the Black Death, whereby many villages moved their centre of habitation a mile or two for fear of being too near the burial site of victims. The 'new' village became known as West Whitfield, before changing to Lower Whitfield and simply as 'Whitfield' as the village gradually grew. Old Whitfield to the northeast then became known as Church Whitfield. The villages developed quite different characters but maintained a close attachment in terms of physical proximity. Early maps such as the Andrews and Drury map of 1769, shows the basic arrangement of the villages, as separate, but linked hamlets.\n\nMap research shows the small scale, village origins of Whitfield, before twentieth century expansion. The village was based around a roughly triangular road pattern, comprising Forge Lane/Lenacre Lane, Church Lane (now Napchester Road and Nursery Lane), and what is known today as The Drove. To the west, development was centred on Lenacre Court, although the original Lenacre Manor may originally have been located further south; a 'Lennickers' is shown on early nineteenth century maps, on roughly the location of Bewsbury Cross Farm. This development led along forge lane to the north, around Whitfield house, and towards the Congregational Chapel, originally built in 1781. To the east, development was clustered around the Windmill with a bakery beneath, originally built in 1755. The example at Whitfield was a smock mill, consisting of an octagonal, weather boarded tower, on a brick or masonry base. However, windmills suffered a rapid decline during the early twentieth century due to an influx of cheap imported grain and new government food regulations. Whitfield mill was demolished in 1916 after standing derelict for many years. This was originally a key focus to the village.\n\nThe village was linked to Church Whitfield and Pineham via Shepherds Cross to the north, and through a series of lanes and footpaths across the fields. It is clear that Whitfield was originally very rural in character with a tight knit collection of lanes in the oldest section of the village to the north of Nursery Lane. Map research shows however, that Whitfield was bisected in the early nineteenth century by the main Sandwich Road. The Mudge map of 1801 shows that a small lane or footpath had been built linking church lane to the crossroads at the top of forge lane. However, by the production of the first small scale ordnance survey maps in 1816, a main route running directly through the village from north to south had been constructed. This altered the village in a drastic manner, literally cutting the settlement in half – the reasoning behind the chosen route is unclear. The Royal Oak Public house dates from this time, built as a coaching stop along this main route to the improving harbour at Sandwich.\n\nThe modern Whitfield developed when more affluent citizens of Dover began to build new homes, alongside the junction of the A2 and A256 roads near the village. Gradually, the historic built form has been subsumed into the modern housing with no clear distinction created between the older segments of the village, and the modern growth. This has diluted the architectural character of Whitfield. As a result, Whitfield is now largely suburban in character, with remnants of the older village scattered throughout. There are a few elements within Whitfield that give some indication of the original character of the village, within the network of small lanes. Post housing dates from the post-war period. Where historic buildings survive, they show a strong tradition of brick and flint. In contrast, church Whitfield has retained a very rural character with a small cluster of houses and farms built around the church. The houses have however, been altered in form and are now mainly rendered and modernised. Post war development enlarged the village and in the 1960s new estates such as Beauxfield were built and extended in the 1980s. The Newlands, Cranleigh Drive and Farncombe Way were built in the 1970s.\n"}
