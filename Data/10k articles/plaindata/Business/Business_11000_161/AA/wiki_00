The basic requirements for financial reporting by all companies in Bangladesh are provided by the Companies Act of 1994. Today, it is represented by two professional bodies, the Institute of Cost & Management Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB).\n\nChartered Accountants complete their training in practising firms and specialise in financial accounting, financial audit and tax. CMAs receive particular training in cost audit, management audit and management accounting, as well as general accounting and taxation. Both the ICMAB and ICAB are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Commerce. The Government of Bangladesh considers both type of professional accountants equal in respect of employment in government services per circular No.Com/PTMA/AP/2/19/87.\n\nThe Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in Bangladesh are based upon standards set by the ICAB, which has stated its intention to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards. , ICAB has adopted the IFRS as issued by the IASB, except for IAS 39, IAS 29, and IFRS 9 and All foreign companies, and domestic companies listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and/or the Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) are required to use IFRS.\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB) prescribes Financial Reporting Standards which are known as Bangladesh Financial Reporting Standards (BFRS). Bangladesh Accounting Standards (BAS) are also included in BFRS. International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board are what the BFRS models on. For listed companies under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, adopted BFRS are legally enforceable. \n\nThe professional Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh's national body is the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh (ICMAB). In order to promote and regulate the Cost and Management Accounting profession in the country, the ICMAB was established. To students interested in pursuing a career in this field, the institute offers training and education and highly recognized CMA degrees on fulfillment of their qualifications. The ICMAB is the sole authority to issue licences to their members for practice in the field. \n\nThey have many visions and missions. By promoting and regulating Cost and Management Accounting they want to improve the quality of life and economic competitiveness which will eventually lead to helping Bangladesh become and industrialized nation. The institute's mission is to provide better service to the society by having its members maintain the highest professional standard while developing, equipping, and promoting the Cost and Management Accounting profession. Implementation of National Accounting as well as Cost Accounting Standards are also used with other necessary steps in order to regulate the profession. The ultimate goal of this is to develop Bangladesh's natural and human resources to enrich the shared future of the country and to ensure common welfare. \n\nThe Institute is governed by a council which is under the provision of the Cost and Management Accountants Ordinance of 1977. There are twelve members consisted in the council and they are elected by the members of ICMAB. The council also consists of four nominees from the Government of Bangladesh. Each term is for three years and every year there is one President, two Vice- Presidents, one Secretary, and one Treasurer elected from the councilors. A team of fully employed personnel, however, manages the day to day administrative affairs of the institute. \n\nThe sole regulator of accountants and auditors in Bangladesh under the Bangladesh Chartered Accountants Order of 1973 was the Institute of Charted Accountants (ICAB). There are many mandatory requirements included in the ICAB: \nMembership in the ICAB is mandatory for all Chartered Accountants whether financial accountant or financial auditor. Fellow Chartered Accountants or Associate Chartered Accountants are usually what members of the ICAB are designated as. \n\n"}

The induction noted \"In addition to his duties as owner of the team, Arthur Griffiths was also actively involved at the league level as a member of the NHL's Marketing / Public Relations Committee.\"\n\nThe younger Griffiths inherited his father's ownership stake in the Vancouver Canucks in 1988. It was Griffiths who led the initiative to build GM Place. The original arena of the Canucks, the Pacific Coliseum, was owned by the Pacific National Exhibition. The old coliseum became unsuitable for the growing team, and as result Griffiths financed the building of GM Place in 1995.\n\nGriffiths sold the Vancouver Canucks in 1997.

{"id": "113560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113560", "title": "Barbara W. Tuchman", "text": "Barbara W. Tuchman\n\nBarbara Wertheim Tuchman (; January 30, 1912 – February 6, 1989) was an American historian and author. She won the Pulitzer Prize twice, for \"The Guns of August\" (1962), a best-selling history of the prelude to and the first month of World War I, and \"Stilwell and the American Experience in China\" (1971), a biography of General Joseph Stilwell.\n\nTuchman focused on writing popular history.\n\nShe was born January 30, 1912, the daughter of the banker Maurice Wertheim and his first wife Alma Morgenthau. Her father was an individual of wealth and prestige, the owner of \"The Nation\" magazine, president of the American Jewish Congress, prominent art collector, and a founder of the Theatre Guild. Her mother was the daughter of Henry Morgenthau, Sr., Woodrow Wilson's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nWhile she did not explicitly mention it in her book \"The Guns of August\", Tuchman was present for one of the pivotal events of the book: the pursuit of the German battle cruiser \"Goeben\" and light cruiser \"Breslau\". In her account of the pursuit she wrote, \"That morning [August 10, 1914] there arrived in Constantinople the small Italian passenger steamer which had witnessed the \"Gloucester\"'s action against \"Goeben\" and \"Breslau\". Among its passengers were the daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren of the American ambassador Mr. Henry Morgenthau.\" As she was a grandchild of Henry Morgenthau, she is referring to herself, which is confirmed in her later book \"Practicing History\", in which she tells the story of her father, Maurice Wertheim, traveling from Constantinople to Jerusalem on August 29, 1914, to deliver funds to the Jewish community there. Thus, at two, Tuchman was present during the pursuit of \"Goeben\" and \"Breslau\", which she documented 48 years later.\n\nWertheim was influenced at an early age by the books of Lucy Fitch Perkins and G.A. Henty, as well as the historical novels of Alexandre Dumas. She attended the Walden School on Manhattan's Upper West Side. She received her Bachelor of Arts from Radcliffe College in 1933, having studied history and literature.\n\nFollowing graduation, Wertheim worked as a volunteer research assistant at the Institute of Pacific Relations in New York, spending a year in Tokyo in 1934-35, including a month in China, before returning to the United States via the Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow and on to Paris. She also contributed to \"The Nation\" as a correspondent until her father's sale of the publication in 1937, traveling to Valencia and Madrid to cover the Spanish Civil War. A first book resulted from her Spanish experience, \"The Lost British Policy: Britain and Spain Since 1700,\" published in 1938.\n\nIn 1940 Wertheim married Lester R. Tuchman (taking his surname), an internist, medical researcher and professor of clinical medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan. They had three daughters, including Jessica Mathews, who became president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nDuring the years of World War II, Tuchman worked in the Office of War Information. Following the war, Tuchman spent the next decade working to raise the children while doing basic research for what would ultimately become the 1956 book \"Bible and Sword: England and Palestine from the Bronze Age to Balfour.\"\n\nWith the publication of \"Bible and Sword\" in 1956, Tuchman dedicated herself to historical research and writing, turning out a new book approximately every four years. Rather than feeling hampered by the lack of an advanced degree in history, Tuchman argued that freedom from the rigors and expectations of academia was actually liberating, as the norms of academic writing would have \"stifled any writing capacity.\"\n\nTuchman favored a literary approach to the writing of history, providing eloquent explanatory narratives rather than concentration upon discovery and publication of fresh archival sources. In the words of one biographer, Tuchman was \"not a historian's historian; she was a layperson's historian who made the past interesting to millions of readers\". Tuchman's storytelling prowess was rewarded in 1963 when she received the Pulitzer Prize for her book \"The Guns of August,\" dealing with the behind-the-scenes political machinations which led to the eruption of World War I in the summer of 1914.\n\nIn 1971, Tuchman received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates.\n\nTuchman received a second Pulitzer in 1972 for her biography of Joseph Stilwell, \"Stilwell and the American Experience in China.\"\n\nIn 1978, Tuchman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She became the first female president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1979. She won a U.S. National Book Award in History for the first paperback edition of \"A Distant Mirror\" in 1980. Also in 1980 the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) selected Tuchman for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. Tuchman's lecture was entitled \"Mankind's Better Moments\".\n\nTuchman was a trustee of Radcliffe College and a lecturer at Harvard, the University of California, and the Naval War College. Although she never received a formal graduate degree in history, Tuchman was the recipient of a number of honorary degrees from leading American universities, including Yale, Harvard, New York University, Columbia, Boston University, and Smith College, among others.\n\nShe died in 1989 in Greenwich, Connecticut, following a stroke, at 77.\n\nA tower of Currier House, a residential division first of Radcliffe College and now of Harvard College, was named in her honor.\n\nIn the introduction to her 1978 book \"A Distant Mirror,\" Tuchman playfully identified a historical phenomenon which she termed \"Tuchman's Law,\" to wit:\n\nDisaster is rarely as pervasive as it seems from recorded accounts. The fact of being on the record makes it appear continuous and ubiquitous whereas it is more likely to have been sporadic both in time and place. Besides, persistence of the normal is usually greater than the effect of the disturbance, as we know from our own times. After absorbing the news of today, one expects to face a world consisting entirely of strikes, crimes, power failures, broken water mains, stalled trains, school shutdowns, muggers, drug addicts, neo-Nazis, and rapists. The fact is that one can come home in the evening — on a lucky day — without having encountered more than one or two of these phenomena. This has led me to formulate Tuchman's Law, as follows: \"The fact of being reported multiplies the apparent extent of any deplorable development by five- to tenfold\" (or any figure the reader would care to supply).\n\nTuchman's Law has been defined as a psychological principle of \"perceptual readiness\" or \"subjective probability\".\n\n\n\n"}

He is credited as being the founder and a \"pioneer\" in the area of market research.\n\nBefore joining the Curtis Publishing Company, Parlin acted as a schoolteacher in the state of Wisconsin. In 1911, he was hired by the Curtis Publishing Company in a job that had no clearly defined title, as the work he was doing had not previously been done. Parlin came up with the name \"commercial research\" for his work, which would later end up being changed to market research. The company had just bought out the magazine, Country Gentleman, but the owner of the company, Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis, had little knowledge about agriculture. Since much of the advertising in the \"Country Gentleman\" magazine was purchased by the agriculturalists, Parlin began researching agriculture in general. After six months of interviews with a number of people in the industry, he completed a 460-page survey that \"revealed unsuspected facts about where agricultural tools were made, to whom they were sold, when, and where.\"\n\nAfter this, Parlin carried out a study on \"the market for almost everything in the nation's one hundred largest cities,\" which involved 1,121 interviews across the nation, compiling all of the fuindings in order to draw conclusions about the workings of the national market. His \"pioneer report\", \"Department Store Lines\", was released in 1912 and it focused on the distinctions between convenience goods and shopping goods and how the marketer should focus on selling primarily shopping goods in order to obtain the highest profits.\n\nIn 1914, Parlin released a five-volume study titled \"Automobiles\". It focused on the future of the automobile age and \"collected facts on manufacturing and distribution, on the influence of women on automobile purchase\". The study predicted correctly that the number of grades and makes would be reduced in the future and it \"envisaged the dimensions and even the shape of the automobile market.\" This information resulted in an increase in advertising by automobile manufacturers, in order to obtain customers faster than their competitors in the burgeoning market for automobiles.\n\nLargely due to Parlin's success, other commercial organisations began creating Departments of Commercial Research including: United States Rubber Company in 1915 and Swift and Company in 1916. Foreseeing a need for \"standardized definitions and common measures\" after the release of Parlin's studies, the Audit Bureau of Circulations was formed in 1914 in order to regulate publisher's claims for newspaper and magazine circulations.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Parlin went on to found the \"first commercial research company\" with Donald M. Hobart, backed by the Curtis Publishing Company, called National Analysts. Parlin retired from the company in 1938 and was succeeded by Hobart.\n\nThe \"Charles Coolidge Parlin Marketing Research Award\" was established in 1945 by \"the Philadelphia Chapter of the AMA and The Wharton School in association with the Curtis Publishing Company to honor persons who have made outstanding contributions to the field of marketing research.\" It is meant to act as a memorial to Parlin, due to his creation of the field of market research.\n\n"}

Contingent contracts usually occur when negotiating parties fail to reach an agreement. The contract is characterized as \"contingent\" because the terms are not final and are based on certain events or conditions occurring. (Malhotra, Bazerman 2008, p. 70).\n\nA contingent contract can also be viewed as protection against a future change of plans (Malhotra, Bazerman 2008, p. 70). Contingent contracts can also lead to effective agreement when each party has different time preferences. For example, one party may desire immediate payoffs, while the other party may be interested in more long-term payoffs (Thompson 2008, p. 122). Further, contingency contracts can foster an agreement in negotiations involving resolute differences of expectations about the future (Malhotra, Baerman 2008, p. 69).\n\nContingent contracts can be used in many types of settings such as work, school, home, etc. In regards to work, a common example of contingent contracts comes in the form of job negotiations. It usually involves the opportunity to discuss salary, position, promotion, etc. However, contingent contracts can often include negotiations regarding flextime, job sharing, responsibilities, etc. Although contingent contracts concerning employment packages are more the exception than the norm, these types of negotiations can be very successful, allowing both parties to walk away feeling very satisfied with the newly agreed upon arrangement (Krutzberg, Naquin 2011, p. 86-87).\n\nThe following examples are everyday agreements that may occur in the workplace:\n\nThe following example illustrates a behavioral contract between a teenager and parents to be used in the home:\n\nA contingent contract can be used to create enormous benefit to both parties. One advantage would be that it limits the loss that would occur if the contract failed. Another would be that it wouldn't make one party gain more at the expense of the other. This leads to an increase in trust between both parties, which would allow them to have more beneficial negotiations in the future.\n\nIn order to be most effective, contingent contracts should possess some of the following characteristics:\nA contingency contract can also be viewed as protection against a future change of plans\n\nNecessary is because the contract is built on expected differences from each party. Each party can leverage their differences through bets that lead to both sides winning (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p. 69). However, contingent contracts do not increase integrative value, rather they affect distribution value (Brett 2007, p. 74). Contingency contracts can create value by causing each negotiating party to stop arguing about their different beliefs. Both parties will be better off because they are each confident in their beliefs, ideas or projections (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p. 69).\n\nContingency contracts can be beneficial for both parties by producing value and motivating performance, however there are some situations in which contingency contracts are not the best solution (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p. 70). Here are some limitations (Mahlotra, Bazerman 2008, p. 71):\n\n"}
{"id": "13647644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13647644", "title": "Coworking", "text": "Coworking\n\nCoworking is a self-directed, collaborative, flexible and voluntary work style that is based on mutual trust and the sharing of common core values between its participants. Coworking involves a shared workplace, often an office, and independent activity. Unlike in a typical office, those coworking are usually not employed by the same organization. Typically, it is attractive to work-at-home professionals, independent contractors, independent scientists or people who travel frequently who end up working in relative isolation. Coworking is a social gathering of a group of people who are still working independently, but who share values and who are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with people who value working in the same place alongside each other. Coworking offers a solution to the problem of isolation that many freelancers experience while working at home, while at the same time letting them escape the distractions of home. It generally costs money in the form of membership dues, though some spaces are free of charge.\n\nCoworking is not only about the physical place, but about establishing a community. Indeed, its rapid growth has been seen as a possible way for city planners to address the decline of high street retail in urban centres. Its benefits can already be experienced outside of the physical spaces, and it is recommended to start with building a coworking community first before considering opening a Coworking place. However, some coworking places don't build a community; they just get a part of an existing one by combining their opening with an event which attracts their target group.\n\nReal-estate centric coworking spaces are about selling desks first, with building community as a secondary goal. Players target freelance professionals, remote workers, and small to medium enterprises (SMEs) who need a space and seek a community with a collaborative spirit. Customers also often benefit from professional services such as printing or incorporation or consulting.\n\nCoworking is distinct from business accelerators, incubators and executive suites. These spaces do not fit into the coworking model because they often miss the social, collaborative, and informal aspects of the process. In coworking, management practices are closer to that of a cooperative, including a focus on community rather than profit. Many of the coworking participants are also participants in an unconference like BarCamp and other related open-source participatory technology events.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2015, a few studies have shown the number of coworking spaces and available seats have roughly doubled each year.\n\nBrad Neuberg is credited with starting the coworking movement in San Francisco in 2005 with the idea to combine the independence of freelancing with the structure and community of an office space. To do this, he invented the word \"coworking\" with no hyphen. Coworking how we experience it today was preceded by European hacker spaces of the 1990s, where programmers would exchange skills and best practices. \n\nSome coworking places were developed by nomadic Internet entrepreneurs seeking an alternative to working in coffee shops and cafes, or to isolation in independent or home offices.\nA 2007 survey showed that many employees worry about feeling isolated and losing human interaction if they were to telecommute. Roughly a third of both private-sector and public-sector workers also reported that they did not want to stay at home during work. A major factor that drives demand for coworking is the growing part of independent workers.\n\nCoworking in Asia has become very popular as space is limited in countries like China, India, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nIn Hong Kong for example, dozens of coworking spaces have been set up to foster the rapidly growing startup community; according to \"Forbes\" it is among the leading tech locations in the world, along with Silicon Valley and New York City. Spread across almost all districts, coworking places can be found everywhere while the majority of places are situated on Hong Kong Island and there predominantly in the Central and Sheung Wan districts.\n\nThe Malaysian state of Penang, long regarded as the \"Silicon Valley of the East\", has also witnessed an increase in coworking spaces. Aside from privately-owned startups, the Penang state government has embarked on a drive to convert colonial-era buildings in the capital city of George Town into coworking spaces.\n\nAs well as tech startups, coworking is becoming increasingly common amongst digital nomads in Asia. A 2011 survey found most coworkers are currently in their late twenties to late thirties, with an average age of 34 years. Two-thirds are men, one third are women. Four in five coworkers started their career with a university education. The majority of coworkers work in creative industries or new media. Slightly more than half of all coworkers are freelancers.\n\nCoworking spaces in India are also on the rise with Mumbai experiencing a huge surge in 2017.\nThere are 200-odd companies offering shared office spaces in India and a sizeable chunk of them still identify themselves as startup-focused spaces. However, more providers of co-working spaces—including Awfis Space Solutions, 91Springboard, InstaOffice, WhyWorks and BHIVE Workspace as well as global companies like WeWork—are positioning themselves as enterprise-focused facilities. \n\nFrance opened its first coworking space in 2007, la Boate, located in Marseilles. In 2008, two new ones open in Paris: and la Ruche.\n\nNowadays, the U.K. is among the most responsive European country to the idea of collaborative working, with a special focus on London. The city leads the coworking market, not only for the large number of coworking places it offers but also for the variety of places that exist to fit the differing needs among start-ups, entrepreneurs and freelancers. Camden Collective is a regeneration project in London that re-purposes previously vacant and underused properties that opened its first ‘wire-less, wall-less’ coworking space in 2009.\n\nIn June 2013, the U.K. Government announced it would be applying coworking principles to a new pilot scheme for its 'One Public Sector Estate' strategy covering 12 local authorities in England, which will encourage councils to work with central government departments and other bodies so that staff share buildings. This will enable the authorities to encourage collaboration as well as re-use or release property and land deemed surplus to requirements, cutting spending and freeing up land for local development.\n\nCoworking is also becoming more common in continental Europe, with the startup metropolis Berlin being a major booster for this development. Several diverse offers can be found in the city, such as Factory Berlin.\n\nThis kind of working environment is not exclusive to big cities. Smaller urban areas with many young and creative people and especially university cities may offer coworking places, with \"Cowork Greifswald\" in Germany being one example. Cooperation between coworking spaces and academic environments are focused.\n\nSince Neuberg started the coworking movement in 2005, San Francisco continues to have a large presence in the coworking community and is home to a growing number of coworking spaces. Also in the Bay Area, Anca Mosoiu established Tech Liminal in 2009, a coworking place in Oakland. In Miami new places have been opening their doors. Coworking has also spread into many other metropolitan areas, with cities such as Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon, Toronto, and Wichita, Kansas now offering several coworking venues. The New York coworking community has also been evolving rapidly in places like Regus and Rockefeller Group Business Center. Several new startups like WeWork have been expanding all over the city. The demand for coworking in Brooklyn neighborhoods is high due to the rise in the millenial workforce; nearly one in 10 workers in the Gowanus area work from home. The industrial area of Gowanus is seeing a surge in new startups that are redesigning old buildings into new coworking spaces. In Brooklyn, in 2008, the first green-focused coworking space in the US, called Green Spaces, was founded by Jennie Nevin, and it expanded in 2009 to Manhattan and Denver and has been a driving force for green entrepreneurship through the collaboration of coworking. New models of coworking that go beyond the original concept of shared office space have also been established. For example, Work and Play in South Orange has onsite childcare for entrepreneurial parents and CoWorking With Wisdom in Berkeley combines coworking with yoga, meditation and mindfulness programs.\n\n\n"}

Stock's paternal Ashkenazi Jewish family originated from Frankfurt am Main, German Empire, while his maternal Sephardi Jewish family arrived in Split during Napoleonic era. His father moved to Split in 1844 from Trieste, Italy. Stock graduated from university with a civil engineering degree. After graduation he built a cement factory near Solin, and also a factory of asbestos-cement products. At the beginning of the 1900s Stock became involved in the production of alcoholic beverages. In 1905 Stock , along with Vid Morpurgo, another Croatian Jewish industrialist, founded the alcoholic beverages company \"Morpurgo, Stock e Comp.\" Stock 84 was being produced in the Split-based old Morpurgo factory. The new company obtained the franchise to construct a new liquor factory on the outskirts of Split (today part of the city). The factory concession was subsequently challenged by the municipal prefect Vicko Mihaljević , ostensibly due to environmental issues, while some attributed the problem to a political conflict between the owners and the municipal authorities. Disappointed by the withdrawal of the concession, Stock and Morpurgo went on to build the factory in Rovinj, Croatia. The business was prosperous so Stock and his partner decided to build a second plant in Trieste, where Stock's brother Lionel already owned the steam wine distillery \"Distilleria a vapore Camis & Stock\" (now Fernet Stock) which produced cognac \"Medicinal\". Stock died in Trieste in 1951.\n"}

{"id": "13653210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13653210", "title": "Expenses versus Capital Expenditures", "text": "Expenses versus Capital Expenditures\n\nUnder the U.S. tax code, businesses expenditures can be deducted from the total taxable income when filing income taxes if a taxpayer can show the funds were used for business-related activities, not personal or capital expenses (i.e., long-term, tangible assets, such as property). Capital expenditures either create cost basis or add to a preexisting cost basis and cannot be deducted in the year the taxpayer pays or incurs the expenditure.\n\nIn terms of its accounting treatment, an expense is recorded immediately and impacts directly the income statement of the company, reducing its net profit. In contrast, a capital expenditure is capitalized, recorded as an asset and depreciated over time.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations (including new regulations proposed in 2006), and case law set forth a series of guidelines that help to distinguish expenses from capital expenditures, although in reality distinguishing between these two types of costs can be extremely difficult. In general, four types of costs related to tangible property must be capitalized:\n\n1. Costs that produce a benefit that will last substantially beyond the end of the taxable year.\n\n2. New assets that have a useful life substantially beyond one year. For example, in \"Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co\"., the taxpayer used its own equipment to construct and improve various facilities that it owned. The taxpayer sought to have the depreciation of the construction equipment treated as a deduction. The Court held that because the equipment was used to invest in a capital asset – the new and improved facilities – the costs had to be treated as capital expenditures.\n\n3. Improvements that prolong the life of the property, restore property to a “like-new” condition, or add value to the property. For example, in \"Fedex Corp. v. United States\", the taxpayer performed repairs upon jet engines by removing them from the airplane and then having parts replaced. The taxpayer argued that these expenses were deductible, but the IRS stated that the costs should be capitalized. The court held that the inspection and replacement costs could be deducted because the improvements did not add to the value and did not prolong the life of the airplanes as a whole.\nIn \"Midland Empire Packing Co. v. Commissioner\", the taxpayer added a concrete lining to its basement floor to prevent oil from seeping into where the taxpayer stored meat. The taxpayer argued that the costs of installation were deductible and the tax court agreed. The costs of installation only permitted the taxpayer to continue the plant’s operation. The expenses did not add to the value of the business or permit the taxpayer to make new uses of the basement.\n\n4. Adaptations that permit the property to be used for a new or different purpose. In contrast to \"Midland Empire Packing Co.\", in \"Mt. Morris Drive-In Theatre Co. v. Commissioner\", under threat of litigation, the taxpayer was forced to create a new drainage system to prevent run-off rainwater from flooding his neighbor's farm. The taxpayer argued that these costs were deductible, but the tax court disagreed. Because the taxpayer knew in advance the property had an inadequate drainage system, the costs to accomplish this adaptation of the property were a capital expenditure. The costs were not simply an improvement of the preexisting drainage system, but rather a completely new addition to the property that permitted the taxpayer to use the property as a drive-in theater.\nThough it is an oversimplification, when trying to distinguish between expenses and capital expenditures it can be helpful to remember that the U.S. tax code attempts to levy tax on those most able to pay it.\n\nImagine that a business buys a truck for $50,000 and uses $5,000 this year on gasoline to distribute tomatoes upon which it earned $20,000. If we want to apportion tax on the business according to its abilities to pay we should ask, \"how much better off is the businesses businesses in Year One?\" It seems unfair to say that the business is $20,000 better off than at the beginning of the year - after all it spent $55,000 to earn those $20,000. However, it also seems unfair to say that the business is $35,000 worse off (the $20,000 earned minus the $55,000 spent) – after all it also has a truck which it will use for years to come. \n\nProbably the fairest characterization is to say that in Year One the business earned $20,000, spent $5,000 on gas, and \"spent\" some (but not all) of the value of the truck it purchased. Since the $5,000 on gas was consumed in Year One and all of its value has been provided during Year One its full cost is properly offset against the income of Year One. In other words it is an \"expense\", and it is recorded right away as such. On the other hand, the truck will contribute to income in Year One, but also contribute to income in future years. Since the truck’s benefits are spread over the years that the truck is in use, we will want to spread the cost of the truck over those subsequent years as well. Otherwise the business would appear overly burdened in Year One and unnaturally profitable every year thereafter. Thus the truck is a \"capital expenditure\" which should be depreciated. However, keep in mind that while depreciation spreads the cost of a capital asset over several years (for tax purposes) it is not intended to actually mirror the real world wear and tear on the asset.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14850094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14850094", "title": "Goal", "text": "Goal\n\nA goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envisions, plans and commits to achieve. People endeavor to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines.\n\nA goal is roughly similar to a purpose or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an end, which is an object, either a physical object or an abstract object, that has intrinsic value.\n\nGoal-setting theory was formulated based on empirical research and has been called one of the most important theories in organizational psychology. Edwin A. Locke and Gary P. Latham, the fathers of goal-setting theory, provided a comprehensive review of the core findings of the theory in 2002. In summary, Locke and Latham found that specific, difficult goals lead to higher performance than either easy goals or instructions to \"do your best\", as long as feedback about progress is provided, the person is committed to the goal, and the person has the ability and knowledge to perform the task.\n\nAccording to Locke and Latham, goals affect performance in the following ways:\n\nA positive relationship between goals and performance depends on several factors. First, the goal must be considered important and the individual must be committed. Participative goal setting can help increase performance, but participation itself does not directly improve performance. Self-efficacy also enhances goal commitment. For goals to be effective, people need feedback that details their progress in relation to their goal.\n\nSome coaches recommend establishing specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bounded (SMART) objectives, but not all researchers agree that these SMART criteria are necessary. The SMART framework does not include goal difficulty as a criterion; in the goal-setting theory of Locke and Latham, it is recommended to choose goals within the 90th percentile of difficulty, based on the average prior performance of those that have performed the task.\n\nGoals can be long-term, intermediate, or short-term. The primary difference is the time required to achieve them. Short-term goals expect accomplishment in a short period of time, such as trying to get a bill paid in the next few days. The definition of a short-term goal need not relate to any specific length of time. In other words, one may achieve (or fail to achieve) a short-term goal in a day, week, month, year, etc. The time-frame for a short-term goal relates to its context in the overall time line that it is being applied to. For instance, one could measure a short-term goal for a month-long project in days; whereas one might measure a short-term goal for someone's lifetime in months or in years. Planners usually define short-term goals in relation to long-term goals.\n\nBefore an individual can set out to achieve a goal, they must first decide on what their desired end-state will be. Peter Gollwitzer's mindset theory of action phases proposes that there are two phases in which an individual must go through if they wish to achieve a goal. For the first phase, the individual will mentally select their goal by specifying the criteria and deciding on which goal they will set based on their commitment to seeing it through. The second phase is the planning phase, in which that individual will decide on which set of behaviors are at their disposal and will allow them to best reach their desired end-state or goal.\n\nIndividuals can set personal goals. A student may set a goal of a high mark in an exam. An athlete might run five miles a day. A traveler might try to reach a destination-city within three hours. Financial goals are a common example, to save for retirement or to save for a purchase.\n\nManaging goals can give returns in all areas of personal life. Knowing precisely what one wants to achieve makes clear what to concentrate and improve on, and often subconsciously prioritizes that goal. However, successful goal adjustment (goal disengagement and goal re-engagement capacities) is also a part of leading a healthy life.\n\nGoal setting and planning (\"goal work\") promotes long-term vision, intermediate mission and short-term motivation. It focuses intention, desire, acquisition of knowledge, and helps to organize resources.\n\nEfficient goal work includes recognizing and resolving all guilt, inner conflict or limiting belief that might cause one to sabotage one's efforts. By setting clearly defined goals, one can subsequently measure and take pride in the accomplishment of those goals. One can see progress in what might have seemed a long, perhaps difficult, grind.\n\nAchieving complex and difficult goals requires focus, long-term diligence and effort (see Goal pursuit). Success in any field requires forgoing excuses and justifications for poor performance or lack of adequate planning; in short, success requires emotional maturity. The measure of belief that people have in their ability to achieve a personal goal also affects that achievement.\n\nLong-term achievements rely on short-term achievements. Emotional control over the small moments of the single day makes a big difference in the long term.\n\nThere has been a lot of research conducted looking at the link between achieving desired goals, changes to self-efficacy and integrity and ultimately changes to subjective well-being. Goal efficacy refers to how likely an individual is to succeed in achieving their goal. Goal integrity refers to how consistent one's goals are with core aspects of the self. Research has shown that a focus on goal efficacy is associated with well-being factor happiness (subjective well-being) and goal integrity is associated with the well-being factor meaning (psychology). Multiple studies have shown the link between achieving long-term goals and changes in subjective well-being; most research shows that achieving goals that hold personal meaning to an individual increases feelings of subjective well-being.\n\nThe self-concordance model is a model that looks at the sequence of steps that occur from the commencement of a goal to attaining that goal. It looks at the likelihood and impact of goal achievement based on the type of goal and meaning of the goal to the individual. Different types of goals impact both goal achievement and the sense of subjective well-being brought about by achieving the goal. The model breaks down factors that promote, first, striving to achieve a goal, then achieving a goal, and then the factors that connect goal achievement to changes in subjective well-being.\n\nGoals that are pursued to fulfill intrinsic values or to support an individual's self-concept are called self-concordant goals. Self-concordant goals fulfill basic needs and align with what psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott called an individual's \"True Self\". Because these goals have personal meaning to an individual and reflect an individual's self-identity, self-concordant goals are more likely to receive sustained effort over time. In contrast, goals that do not reflect an individual's internal drive and are pursued due to external factors (e.g. social pressures) emerge from a non-integrated region of a person and are therefore more likely to be abandoned when obstacles occur.\n\nThose who attain self-concordant goals reap greater well-being benefits from their attainment. Attainment-to-well-being effects are mediated by need satisfaction, i.e., daily activity-based experiences of autonomy, competence, and relatedness that accumulate during the period of striving. The model is shown to provide a satisfactory fit to 3 longitudinal data sets and to be independent of the effects of self-efficacy, implementation intentions, avoidance framing, and life skills.\n\nFurthermore, self-determination theory and research surrounding this theory shows that if an individual effectively achieves a goal, but that goal is not self-endorsed or self-concordant, well-being levels do not change despite goal attainment.\n\nIn organizations, goal management consists of the process of recognizing or inferring goals of individual team-members, abandoning goals that are no longer relevant, identifying and resolving conflicts among goals, and prioritizing goals consistently for optimal team-collaboration and effective operations.\n\nFor any successful commercial system, it means deriving profits by making the best quality of goods or the best quality of services available to end-users (customers) at the best possible cost. Goal management includes:\n\nJens Rasmussen (human factors expert) and Morten Lind distinguish three fundamental categories of goals related to technological system management:\n\nOrganizational goal-management aims for individual employee goals and objectives to align with the vision and strategic goals of the entire organization. Goal-management provides organizations with a mechanism to effectively communicate corporate goals and strategic objectives to each person across the entire organization. The key consists of having it all emanate from a pivotal source and providing each person with a clear, consistent organizational-goal message so that every employee understands how their efforts contribute to an enterprise's success.\n\nAn example of goal types in business management:\n\nGoal displacement occurs when the original goals of an entity or organization are replaced over time by different goals. In some instances, this creates problems, because the new goals may exceed the capacity of the mechanisms put in place to meet the original goals. New goals adopted by an organization may also increasingly become focused on internal concerns, such as establishing and enforcing structures for reducing common employee disputes. In some cases, the original goals of the organization become displaced in part by repeating behaviors that become traditional within the organization. For example, a company that manufactures widgets may decide to do seek good publicity by putting on a fundraising drive for a popular charity, or having a tent at a local county fair. If the fundraising drive or county fair tent is successful, the company may choose to make this an annual tradition, and may eventually involve more and more employees and resources in the new goal of raising the most charitable funds, or having the best county fair tent. In some cases, goals are displaced because the initial problem is resolved or the initial goal becomes impossible to pursue. A famous example is the March of Dimes, which began as an organization to fund the fight against polio, but once that disease was effectively brought under control by the polio vaccine, transitioned to being an organization for combating birth defects.\n\n"}

It was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the third largest urban fire in the U.S., next to the Great Chicago Fire, and the 1906 San Francisco fire.\n\nIn 1901, Jacksonville was a city which consisted mainly of wooden buildings with wood shingled roofs. The city itself had been suffering under a prolonged drought, leaving the building exteriors across the city dry and fire-prone.\nAt around noon on Friday, May 3, 1901, workers at the Cleaveland Fibre Factory, located on the corner of Beaver and Davis Streets, left for lunch. Several minutes later, sparks from the chimney of a nearby building started a fire in a pile of Spanish moss that had been laid out to dry. First, factory workers tried to put it out with a few buckets of water, as they had frequently done on similar occasions. However, the blaze was soon out of control due to the wind picking up out of the east. A brisk northwest wind fanned the flames, which \"spread from house to house, seemingly with the rapidity that a man could walk\".\n\nIn eight hours, the fire burned 146 city blocks, destroyed more than 2,368 buildings, and left almost 10,000 residents homeless. It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah, Georgia, and the smoke plumes in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nJames Weldon Johnson, principal of a local school claimed, however, that firemen tried to save the fire from spreading to a white neighborhood, allowing black parts of town to burn down in the process:\"We met many people fleeing. From them we gathered excitedly related snatches: the fiber factory catches afire - the fire department comes - fanned by a light breeze, the fire is traveling directly east and spreading out to the north, over the district where the bulk of Negroes in the western end of the city live - the firemen spend all their efforts saving a low row of frame houses just across the street on the south side of the factory, belonging to a white man named Steve Melton.\"\n\nFlorida Governor William S. Jennings declared martial law in Jacksonville and dispatched several state militia units to help. Reconstruction began immediately, and the city was returned to civil authority on May 17. Seven human deaths were reported. St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, built of bricks in 1887, was the only major church in the city to withstand the fire. The Duval County Courthouse and all its real estate records were destroyed in the fire. To this day real estate deeds in Duval County refer either to \"the current public records of Duval County, Florida\" or, if the records predate the fire, \"the former public records of Duval County, Florida.\" It is the only county in Florida for which that is the case. The only existing pre-Fire real estate records are title abstracts saved by Title and Trust, a title company that still charges for their use.\n\nNew York City architect Henry John Klutho helped rebuild the city. He and other architects, enamored by the \"Prairie Style\" of architecture then being popularized by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago and other Midwestern cities, designed exuberant local buildings with a Florida flair. Buildings designed by Klutho were Dyal-Upchurch Building (1902), Carnegie Library (1905), Bisbee Building (1909), Morocco Temple (1910), and the Florida Baptist Building (1924) While many of Klutho's buildings were demolished or abandoned by the 1980s, several of his creations remain including his most prominent work the St. James Building. The Jacksonville City Hall currently uses the St. James Building. Local charity Fresh Ministries recently restored the Klutho Apartments, in Springfield, and converted them into office space for the Community Development Corporation's Operation New Hope. Jacksonville has one of the largest collections of Prairie Style buildings (particularly residences) outside the Midwest.\n\n"}

{"id": "477765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477765", "title": "Kathleen Kennedy Townsend", "text": "Kathleen Kennedy Townsend\n\nKathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend (born July 4, 1951) is an American attorney who was the sixth Lieutenant Governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003. She ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Maryland in 2002. In 2010 Townsend became the chair of the non-profit American Bridge, an organization whose focus is to raise funds for Democratic candidates and causes. She is a member of the prominent political Kennedy family.\n\nTownsend was born as Kathleen Hartington Kennedy in Greenwich, Connecticut, the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel's 11 children, the eldest grandchild of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Kennedy. A baptismal certificate from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Greenwich shows that the godparents at the July 22, 1951 baptismal were Jean Kennedy and Daniel Walsh, a professor at Manhattanville College who later became a Catholic priest. She was named after her aunt, Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington. It was not assumed that the girls in the politically oriented Kennedy family would run for office or become public persons, while she was growing up. However, after her uncle President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, her father wrote her saying, \"As the oldest of the next generation you have a particular responsibility. ... Be kind to others and work for your country.\" Her family gave her the nicknames \"Clean Kathleen\", \"the Nun\", and \"the Un-Kennedy\".\n\nOver the summer of 1964, Kennedy won four blue ribbons for her \"excellence in horsemanship\".\nOn August 29, 1965, the fourteen-year-old Kennedy was somersaulted by her horse while competing at Sea Flash Farms in West Barnstable, Massachusetts. She was left unconscious and bleeding internally and was rushed to Cape Cod Hospital, located fifteen miles away. Her family was en route to Hyannis Port at the time of the incident and was not located for another three hours.\nShe was sixteen when her father was assassinated. The night he was shot at the Ambassador Hotel, Kennedy and her two eldest brothers, Joe and Robert, Jr., were being flown to Los Angeles aboard one of the jets in the Secret Service's presidential fleet named \"the Jet Star\". She spent most of her childhood in McLean, Virginia, and attended Stone Ridge School in nearby Bethesda, Maryland. She graduated from The Putney School in Vermont. She attended Radcliffe College, receiving her bachelor's degree in history and literature in 1974. She then studied at the University of New Mexico School of Law, receiving her Juris Doctor degree in 1978.\n\nAfter graduation, she was admitted to and is a member of the Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maryland bar associations. For several years, she worked as an attorney in New Haven, Connecticut, while her husband attended Yale Law School. She also worked on her uncle Ted Kennedy's 1980 presidential campaign, stumped for local Democrats, and was a policy analyst for the Massachusetts governor's office in the early 1980s.\n\nThe family moved to Maryland, her husband's home state, in 1984. In 1986, Townsend became the first Kennedy to lose a general election when she ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in Maryland's strongly Republican second congressional district, using the name Townsend only. Incumbent Republican Helen Delich Bentley defeated her 59% to 41%.\n\nShe then went to work for the state government of Maryland, holding numerous posts including assistant Attorney General.\n\nIn 1994, Parris Glendening was running for Governor in a highly contested primary against then-Lt. Governor Melvin A. Steinberg when he selected her as his running mate. Experts did not believe she would be an asset, but her name recognition (she now used the name Kennedy Townsend) and her fund-raising skills, helped him to win.\nIn the general election, Glendening and Townsend beat Republican candidate Ellen Sauerbrey in one of Maryland's closest and most controversial gubernatorial elections. After unofficial results indicated that Sauerbrey had lost the election by a narrow margin, she began making what \"The Washington Post\" called \"sensational charges\" that the election had been stolen. Sauerbrey's allegations included ballot box stuffing, 100% voting in one precinct, voting by numerous dead people, and what she called the Kennedy \"precedent\"—that unproven rumors that John Kennedy had stolen the 1960 Presidential election proved that his niece Townsend had stolen this election.\n\nThe official vote tally declared Glendening the winner by 5,993 votes out of 1.4 million. Sauerbrey hired an election specialist known for aggressive tactics then filed a lawsuit alleging that 50,000 votes had been cast illegally. By the time the hearing began in January 1995, however, Sauerbrey had backed away from the fraud charges and her claim centered on sloppy election procedures and 3,600 challenged ballots. The number of challenged ballots would not have been enough to change the result even if all of them were thrown out. The judge ruled that about 1,800 votes had been cast in Baltimore by people whose names should have been purged from the rolls, but said that there was no clear and convincing evidence that fraud or procedural errors had affected the outcome. Sauerbrey dropped the suit three days before Glendening was to be inaugurated, but still maintained her belief that she had won the election.\n\nSauerbrey ran against Glendening again in 1998, but this time Glendening and Townsend won by a much wider margin (55% to 44%).\n\nDuring her tenure as lieutenant governor, Townsend focused on reducing crime and promoting economic development.\n\nIn the Maryland gubernatorial election of 2002, Townsend faced off against Republican Robert Ehrlich and Libertarian Spear Lancaster.\n\nDuring the campaign, Townsend was criticized for her choice of running mate, Admiral Charles R. Larson, a novice politician who had switched parties only a few weeks before. Larson was also a white male, unlikely to help minority turnout. Ehrlich's running mate was Michael Steele, an African-American lawyer who had been chairman of the Republican Party of Maryland.\n\nThough Maryland traditionally votes Democratic and had not elected a Republican Governor in almost 40 years, Townsend lost the race, gaining 48% of the vote to Ehrlich's 51% and Lancaster's 1%. Ehrlich became only the seventh Republican governor in state history. The \"Baltimore Sun\" said the defeat derailed her political career, at least in the short run.\n\nTownsend, along with siblings Robert, Jr. and Kerry, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the 2008 Democratic primaries. Subsequently, other family members (siblings Rory, Max, mother Ethel, cousins Caroline and Patrick and uncle Ted) endorsed Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination. Once Obama won the nomination, however, Townsend and her siblings Robert, Jr. and Kerry supported him in the general election.\n\nSince leaving office, Townsend has written the book, \"Failing America's Faithful: How Today's Churches Are Mixing God with Politics and Losing Their Way\", (Warner Books, 2007, ). Townsend also contributes to \"The Recovering Politician\" website started by Jonathan Miller.\n\nShe is an adjunct professor at the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, a visiting fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and senior Nitze fellow at St. Mary's College of Maryland.\n\nIn December 2010, she was appointed chair of American Bridge, a new non-profit that will raise funds for Democratic candidates and causes, and that is intended to be a Democratic counterpart to right-leaning organizations such as American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS. She noted that the Democrats did not have such an organization during the 2010 election cycle, and that Republicans outspent the Democrats by $70 million. \"I want to compete dollar to a dollar with the Republicans and I want to beat them\", she said.\n\nIn 1973, she married David Lee Townsend (b. 1947), whom she had met when he was a graduate student and her tutor at Radcliffe. David is now a member of the faculty at St. John's College in Annapolis. The couple has four daughters: Meaghan Anne Kennedy Townsend (born November 7, 1977), Maeve Fahey Kennedy Townsend (born November 1, 1979), Rose Katherine \"Kat\" Kennedy Townsend (born December 17, 1983) and Kerry Sophia Kennedy Townsend (born November 30, 1991). On June 27, 2011, her daughter Maeve gave birth to a son named Gideon Joseph Kennedy McKean. Gideon is the first great-grandchild for Bobby and Ethel as well as the first of the \"sixth-generation\" of Kennedys. On January 3, 2013, Maeve had her second child, a daughter Gabriella. Gabriella is the second of the \"sixth-generation\" of Kennedys. Meaghan and her Husband Billy Birdzell had twins Arabella & David Kennedy Birdzell on August 15, 2016. Maeve gave birth to a boy Toby McKean in 2017.\n\nShe has served on the boards of many organizations, and as a consultant to several corporations. She is the chair of the Institute for Human Virology at the University of Maryland. She is on the boards of directors of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, the Points of Light Foundation, the Center for American Progress and Catholic Democrats. She was formerly on the independent Advisory Council of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), a panel that was appointed to review the functioning of ACORN following the scandal touched off by hidden camera videos in September 2009, and the board of the \"National Catholic Reporter\". Townsend is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Inter-American Dialogue. She is also on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service. She is on the Board of Directors at the Lightbridge nuclear fuel technology company.\n\n\n"}

It is a leading liberal business broadsheet. The TNS Media and NRS Russia certified July 2013 circulation of the daily was 120,000-130,000.\n\nThe newspaper was initially published in 1909, and it was closed down following the Bolshevik seizure of power and the introduction of censorship in 1917.\n\nIn 1989, with the onset of press freedom in Russia, \"Kommersant\" was re-established under the ownership of businessman and publicist Vladimir Yakovlev.\n\nTo make the point that the publication had outlasted the Soviet regime, \"Kommersant\" is spelled in Russian with a terminal hard sign (ъ) – a letter that is silent at the end of a word in modern Russian, and was thus largely abolished by the post-revolution Russian spelling reform. This is played up in the Kommersant logo, which features a script hard sign at the end of somewhat more formal font. The newspaper also refers to itself or its redaction as “Ъ”.\n\nIn 1997, autos-to-Aeroflot mogul Boris Berezovsky – a member of the former President Boris Yeltsin's 'family' – bought the Kommersant publishing house, which included \"Kommersant-daily\", two serious weekly magazines (the political \"Kommersant-vlast\" (literally 'Power') and the financial \"Kommersant Dengi\" ('Money') – as well as entertainment magazines \"Domovoi\" and \"Avtopilot\" and \"Molotok\", a teen magazine, which later incurred the authorities' wrath.\n\nBerezovsky sacked \"Kommersant\"'s director-general, Andrei Vassiliev, and editor-in-chief, Alexander Stukalin, on 14 July 2005 in a move widely seen as preparation for the 2008 Russian presidential elections.\n\nIn January 2005, \"Kommersant\" published blank pages as a protest at a court ruling ordering it to publish a denial of a story about a crisis at Alfa-Bank. The sole article in the paper was this one, published upside down, on the front page. The headline of the article was \"Full Plaintiff\" (полный истец) which has little meaning, but rhymes with a Russian swear word, meaning \"complete disaster\" (). The English version of the article was headed \"Alfa-d Up\".\n\nBerezovsky sold the Kommersant publishing house to an old friend and business partner, Georgian fruit canner and opposition television station owner Badri Patarkatsishvili, who was already chairman of the Kommersant company's board. In August 2006, Patarkatsishvili sold his 100% stake in the Kommersant publishing house to Alisher Usmanov, head of Gazprom's Gazprominvestholding subsidiary.\n\nAfter clashing with Usmanov, \"Kommersant\" editor-in-chief Vladislav Borodulin left the paper. \"[Borodulin’s] decision to resign was not forced, but evidently they expressed different views on how the publishing house should be developed,\" said the group's commercial director. Andrei Vasilyev, appointed for a second stint at the helm of the daily – after a long run from 1999 to 2005– said \"Kommersant-daily\" had no intention of following any imposed policy, and added that the edition would carry articles that might not please the owner.\n\nOn 9 December 2008 the publication of articles in English ceased, and currently the Kommersant website has no English version. Since February 2009 \"Kommersant\" newspaper is printed and distributed in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2015, the paper began hosting US-Russia Crosstalk, a joint initiative between \"Kommersant\" and the Valdai Club in Russia, and \"The Washington Times\" and the Center for the National Interest in the United States, featuring foreign policy related discussion regarding relations between the two countries.\n\nIn January 2000 \"Kommersant\" was found guilty of libel against Russian entrepreneur Alex Konanykhin and ordered to pay compensation of US$3,000,000.\n\nIn May 2009 a Russian MP and prominent businessman Oleg Mikheyev sued the \"Kommersant\" for $217 million, claiming that one of the newspaper's articles \"spoiled of his bank so badly it had to be sold at disadvantageous price\".

{"id": "44421969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44421969", "title": "Money Monster", "text": "Money Monster\n\nMoney Monster is a 2016 American thriller film directed by Jodie Foster and written by Alan Di Fiore, Jim Kouf and Jamie Linden. The film stars George Clooney (who also co-produced) as Lee Gates, a TV personality who advises his audience on commerce and Wall Street, and who is forcefully interrogated by Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell), a grief-stricken bankrupt viewer who lost his money after a previous tip; the film also stars Julia Roberts, Giancarlo Esposito, Dominic West and Caitriona Balfe.\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 27, 2015 in New York City. The film was released by Sony Pictures Entertainment through TriStar Pictures on May 13, 2016, received mixed reviews from critics and grossed over $93 million.\n\nFlamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, \"Money Monster\". Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview about the crash, but Camby unexpectedly left for a business trip to Geneva.\n\nMidway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. He is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000—his entire life savings—in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on the show. Kyle was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, he will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver—and with it, Kyle's leverage—is to shoot Lee and hope he survives.\n\nWith the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and find Camby for him, though Kyle is not satisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He also is not satisfied by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied by her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues to contact a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position unless someone meddled with it.\n\nLee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. New York City police find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, seemingly taking pity on Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong.\n\nOnce Camby finally returns, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that he did not go to Geneva but to Johannesburg. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the \"Money Monster\" team contact a group of Icelandic hackers to seek the truth. After a police sniper takes a shot at Lee and misses, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at Federal Hall National Memorial, where Camby is headed according to Diane. They head out with one of the network's cameramen, Lenny, plus the police and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers.\n\nIt turns out that Camby bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owners stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. If Camby's plan had succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when work resumed at the mine and the stock of the mine's owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe the union leader, Moshe Mambo, in order to stop the strike, but Mambo refused and continued the strike, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the flailing company.\n\nDespite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. Camby admits to his wrongdoing to Kyle on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away, then much to Lee's dismay gets fatally shot by the police. In the aftermath, the SEC announces that IBIS will be put under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nThe project \"Money Monster\" was first announced by \"Deadline\" on February 7, 2012, when Daniel Dubiecki launched his own film production company, \"The Allegiance Theater\". It would be the company's first produced film. IM Global financed while Dubiecki produced, along with Stuart Ford.\n\nAlan Di Fiore and Jim Kouf wrote the script of the film. On October 11, 2012, Jodie Foster was set to direct the film. Lara Alameddine also produced the film. The story was altered from its original script inspired by the stock market glitch and crash of Cynk Technologies.\n\nOn July 25, 2014, TriStar Pictures won the rights to finance and release the film, whose latest draft was written by Jamie Linden. Clooney and Grant Heslov also produced for their Smoke House Pictures.\n\nOn May 8, 2014, it was announced that George Clooney was director Foster's choice to star in the film as a TV personality, Lee Gates, but the deal was not yet confirmed. Clooney's involvement was confirmed in July 2014. Jack O'Connell and Julia Roberts were added to the cast November 14, 2014 to star along with Clooney in the film. Caitriona Balfe joined the cast of the film on January 29, 2015, to play the head of PR of the company whose stock bottomed. Dominic West signed-on on February 25, 2015 to play the CEO of the company. Christopher Denham also joined the cast on March 4, 2015, playing Ron, a producer on the show.\n\nIn October 2012, filming was scheduled to begin early 2013. In July 2014, it was announced that production would begin after Clooney completed the Coen brothers' \"Hail, Caesar!\", and principal photography on the film began in New York City on February 27, 2015.\n\nClooney was spotted on March 1 arriving at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, NYC to film scenes. On April 8, filming began on Wall Street in the Financial District, Manhattan, where it would last for 15 days. A scene was also shot in front of Federal Hall National Memorial. Some re-shooting for the film took place in mid-January 2016 in New York City on William Street and Broad Street.\n\nIn August 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment set the film for an April 8, 2016 release. The film was later pushed back to May 13, 2016.\nThe Money Monster Premiered in Cannes on May 12, 2016, where the cast attended the photocall and screening in the evening.\n\n\"Money Monster\" grossed $41 million in the United States and Canada, and $52.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $93.3 million, against a net production budget of $27 million.\n\nIn North America, the film was projected to gross $10–12 million from 3,104 theaters in its opening weekend. The film grossed $600,000 from its early Thursday night previews and $5 million on its first day. It went on to gross $14.8 million in its opening weekend, beating expectations and finishing 3rd at the box office behind \"\" ($72.6 million) and \"The Jungle Book\" ($17.1 million). It fell 53% to $7 million in its second weekend, finishing 6th.\n\n\"Money Monster\" met with mixed reviews from critics. As of April 2018, the film holds a 57% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 255 reviews with the consensus stating: \"\"Money Monster\"s strong cast and solidly written story ride a timely wave of socioeconomic anger that's powerful enough to overcome an occasionally muddled approach to its worthy themes.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while comScore reported audiences gave an 81% overall positive score and a 56% definite recommend.\n\nClooney's performance was praised by critics. A.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" said that the \"quality of the acting both enhances the credibility of the narrative and exposes some of its weak points\". Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com, in a mixed review, praised Clooney's \"enormous charisma\", but criticised that the film \"never ends up being quite as thrilling or thought-provoking as [its] premise sounds\". Chris Hewitt of \"Empire\" also praised the film.\n\nSeveral reviewers praised the atmosphere of suspense. Sandra Hall of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" praised the film, particularly Foster's directing and her ability to \"keep things moving\". Richard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that Foster \"keeps the action vigorous and the suspense high\", but said that the film was \"swallowed up by the very hectoring and impersonal sensationalism that it derides\".\n\nSome reviewers criticised the script. Wendy Ide of \"The Guardian\" gave the film a negative review, writing that the film lacks the \"authentic anger\" of \"The Big Short\" and the \"sniper-like accuracy\" of \"Network\", and criticising Clooney's \"complete lack of sincerity\". Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" said that what the script lacks in \"emotional subtext\" can be found in the cast's \"richly detailed\" performances. In a mixed review, Robbie Collin of \"The Telegraph\" called the film a \"raucous hostage thriller that eschews explanation for wish-fulfillment\", concluding by saying that \"in the heat of the moment, \"Money Monster\"s bluster and nerve keeps you hooked\". Josh Lasser of IGN was critical of the film's mix of comedy and drama, calling the transitions \"too fast, ripping the audience out of the unfolding drama\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14761765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14761765", "title": "OHADA", "text": "OHADA\n\nOHADA is a system of corporate law and implementing institutions adopted by seventeen West and Central African nations in 1993 in Port Louis, Mauritius. OHADA is the acronym for the French \"Organisation pour l'harmonisation en Afrique du droit des affaires\", which translates into English as \"Organisation for the Harmonization of Corporate Law in Africa\".\n\nThe OHADA Treaty is made up today of 17 African states. Initially fourteen African countries signed the treaty, with two countries (Comoros and Guinea) subsequently adhering to the treaty and a third (the Democratic Republic of Congo) due to adhere shortly. The Treaty is open to all states, whether or not they are members of the Organisation of African Unity. OHADA was created with the objective of fostering economic development in West and Central Africa by creating a better investment climate so as to attract investment in a 225 million-consumer market.\n\nAs a West and Central African initiative to harmonize business laws and implementing institutions, OHADA aims to find alternative solutions to the lack of economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa - a region which has challenged and puzzled development economists for several decades. The stated purpose of the initiative is to facilitate and encourage both domestic and foreign investment in the member states, and as most of the participating countries are former French colonies, they draw chiefly on a modernised French legal model to achieve their goals. The laws promulgated by OHADA are exclusively business-related. The OHADA treaty has created a supranational court (Common Court of Justice and Arbitration of the Organization for the Harmonization in Africa of Business Law ) to ensure uniformity and consistent legal interpretations across the member countries, and the French influence in court proceedings is apparent.\n\nThe most critical tool for legal integration is the Uniform Act. A uniform act is the recollection of all relevant legal norms needed to ease business in the Member States. As of today, OHADA includes nine validated Uniform Acts: General Commercial Law, Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups, Secured Transactions Law, Debt Resolution Law, Insolvency Law, Arbitration Law, Harmonization of Corporate Accounting, Contracts for the Carriage of Goods, Cooperatives Companies Law. Two Uniform Acts (Arbitration and Accounting) are currently being revised.\n\n"}
{"id": "44534062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44534062", "title": "P2P asset management", "text": "P2P asset management\n\nPeer-to-peer asset management is the practice of sharing investment strategies between unrelated individuals, or \"peers\", without going through a traditional financial intermediary such as a bank or other collective investment management vehicle.\n\nThe rationale for P2P asset management is financial disintermediation. When multiple intermediaries participate in an investment management transaction, there is the potential for a conflict of interest between providers and buyers of the service, in a well documented sequence described in economic theory as the principal–agent problem. Intermediaries seek profit maximization. In the context of investment management, they offer the most attractive risk/return propositions to larger, more sophisticated customers. This maximizes their commission revenue for a given distribution effort. Further, given the option between two comparable investment opportunities, an intermediary enticed by investment management kickbacks will recommend the option most lucrative to him, perhaps at the expense of the best interests of non-sophisticated investors.\n\nThis regime is under regulatory and competitive pressure because it privileges large, sophisticated investors at the cost of the choice available to the relatively worse-off, and because incentives are against the most vulnerable element of the chain. The FCA (UK), have implemented the \"treating customers fairly\" policy, with wide-ranging reforms such as the Retail Distribution Review, gradually banning \"kickbacks\" whereby providers of investment management services reward \"independent\" advisers who place their products.\n\nRather than the symptom – kickbacks and inadequate advice – new competitors tackle the issue – multiple intermediaries – by disrupting the intermediation chain. Propositions like Wealthfront (US) and Nutmeg (UK) leverage the reach of the Internet to pair a central provider of investment management services with end-customers online.\n\nP2P asset management takes dis-intermediation full circle. Rather than a central provider directing investors choices, an information exchange takes place between all investors, whereby the best performing strategies by all are made available to all. The first completely P2P provider is Darwinex (UK). Darwinex describe themselves as an exchange pairing providers with buyers of investment strategies, without intermediaries. Buyers pay providers with a share in their investment profits, with Darwinex acting as a central counter-party that independently lists the strategies for a public quoted price based off the underlying assets, rates strategy quality and manages investor risk.\n\nP2P asset management offers the potential benefit vs. centralized providers that all participants crowdsource strategies that are independently rated in a competitive set-up.\n\nWhile peer-to-peer asset management shares some of the characteristics of traditional investment management services, owing to its innovative nature it is sometimes referred to as an alternative financial service.\n\nThe key characteristics of peer-to-peer asset management are:\n\n\nEarly peer-to-peer asset management was also characterized by disintermediation and reliance on social networks but features like \"Social Trading\" have started to fade. Since \"Social Trading\" disclosed live trades, investors learnt to replicate the strategies without compensation to the best providers, who then refused to publish them.\n\nPopular providers of P2P asset management services such as Darwinex provide the following services:\n\nP2P asset management is a recent industry. Growth by venture backed companies like Currensee or Covestor failed to satisfy their backers, and without additional funding, some were bought (Currensee).\n\nSome customers argued that failure to independently manage the risk of the strategies or to protect the intellectual property of the providers breached the confidence chain required between strategy providers and investors.\n\nP2P asset managers broadly require two sets of regulatory permission. The first is to carry out brokerage services on behalf of traders and investors. The second is to manage investment strategies on behalf of retail or professional investors.\n\nIn the UK, these two permissions are the local implementation of MiFID regulation, referred to as \"Dealing in investments as agent\" for brokerage services, and \"Dealing in investments as principal\" and \"Managing Investments\" for the asset management side of the proposition. Further, permission is required for \"Arranging safeguarding and administration of assets\", which grants investors protection under the FCA Client Money Rules.\n\nAn important nuance is that P2P asset managers could suffer a conflict of interest, if in addition to acting in an agent capacity, providing investment management and brokerage services, they entered deals for their own account, acting as principals. This would stack their principal interests against the customers it served as agent. Traditional providers of financial services potentially suffering this conflict claim to overcome it by enforcing a Chinese wall.\n\nP2P managers like Darwinex, tackle the issue at source by acting exclusively in an agent capacity. Customers may verify this restriction by ensuring that P2P managers hold the \"matched principal restriction\", whereby the regulator bans their engaging in any activity as a principal. A further test to identify conflicts of interest is to verify that execution services are provided at arms' length through 3rd parties (ideally recognized exchanges), at public prices.\n\nThe main advantage of P2P asset management is the lack of intermediaries, which results in two structural advantages.\n\nThe first is that all incentives are aligned. The strategy provider can be certain that the strategy is not disclosed by the exchange because this would drop its prize to zero and hurt the exchange. The investor can be certain that the exchange will do its best to rate the strategies accurately, since it is the only way to ensure long term volumes.\n\nThe second advantage is that any profits achieved by the strategies are only shared between the strategy provider, the buyer, and the exchange. There is a single intermediary, without which the profit exchange is not possible, but no more.\n\nSome have criticised P2P asset managers for the lack of \"professional\" asset management expertise by the strategy providers.\n\n"}

{"id": "23736675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23736675", "title": "Public Service Commission of Canada", "text": "Public Service Commission of Canada\n\nThe Public Service Commission of Canada (PSC; ) is an independent government agency that safeguards merit-based hiring, non-partisanship, representativeness of Canada's diversity and the use of both official languages (English and French) in the Canadian public service. The PSC aims to protect the integrity of hiring and promotion within the public service. As well, the Commission works to protect the political impartiality and non-partisanship of public servants. The Commission develops staffing policies and provides guidance to public service managers and recruits Canadians into the public service. To ensure the staffing system in the government is properly maintained, the PSC has the authority to audit and investigate to ensure departments and managers make improvements. While typical government departments are headed by Ministers, the PSC is an independent agency that is headed by a President (currently Patrick Borbey) who reports to the Canadian Parliament.\n\nThe PSC has the mandate to appoint people to the public service, and to promote people within the government which can in turn be delegated to deputy heads (often referred to as Deputy Ministers in Canada). The PSC can also assist government departments with recruitment and assessment services.\nThe PSC oversees the integrity of the hiring and promotion system, and makes sure that the hiring process is not compromised by partisan interference from elected officials. Part of this overseeing role involves collecting and analyzing data on hiring and promotion in the public service (e.g., hiring of different groups, by region, by department). As well, the PSC performs audits across the staffing system, examining hiring and promotion files, to ensure that employees are hired and promoted based on merit. Lastly, the PSC administers the Part VII of \"Public Service Employment Act\" that recognizes the rights of public service employees to engage in political activities while maintaining the principle of political impartiallity in the public service.\nThe mission of the PSC is to achieve \"A highly competent, non-partisan and representative Public Service, able to provide services in both official languages and in which employment practices are characterized by fairness, access, representativeness and transparency\n\nThe PSC has set out four program activities that are done to reach its strategic outcome:\n\n\nThe 2003 \"Public Service Employment Act\" (which came into force on December 31, 2005) emphasizes the values of merit, non-partisanship, fairness, access, transparency and representativeness.\n\nMerit refers to the use of essential qualifications during the hiring and promotion process. This means that people who are hired and promoted in the public service must possess certain competencies, skills, and experience (merit), rather than based on political connections or partisan affiliations (political patronage). The merit principle requires that every person who is appointed to the public service has met the essential qualifications and requirements established for the position. The essential requirements can include official language proficiency, asset qualifications, operational requirements (e.g., availability to do shift work or work on weekends), and organizational needs (e.g., need to increase the hiring of women) that have been identified by the head of a department or agency.\n\nNon-partisanship means that appointments of people to the public service (and promotions of public servants )have to be made without political influence from Ministers or partisan officials. Although Canadian public servants were disallowed any involvement in political activities in their private time throughout much of the 20th century, in 1967, legislative changes allowed public servants to request permission to take leave without pay to run in an election. In 1991, a Supreme Court decision gave public servants the right to engage in political activities. The 2003 Public Service Employment Act clarified what political activities public servants are allowed to engage in.\n\nPublic servants can engage in political activities such as supporting a candidate in an election or taking leave without pay to run in an election, but they have to maintain their political impartiality as public servants. In order to comply with the non-partisanship values in the Act, public servants must only do the types of political activities that do not conflict or impair their ability to fulfill their responsibilities in a politically impartial manner. The type and degree of political activities that a public servant can engage in depends on several factors, such as the visibility of the political activities that the public servant wants to engage in and the visibility of the public servant in their job in the public service.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the center, not only for the city or the municipality, but also neighboring municipalities. The greater downtown area also called \"Centro\" can also include most districts part of Póvoa de Varzim Parish.\n\nDowntown, as defined by the City Hall, is arranged around Praça do Almada, the civic center, and extends in all directions for a number of blocks, including Junqueira shopping street, Passeio Alegre waterfront square, Mouzinho de Albuquerque business avenue, and Praça Marquês de Pombal (market square). It does not include the medieval and Discovery Age civic center of the city which is located in Bairro da Matriz district.\n\nDespite proven to be occupied at least since the Roman period, Downtown developed its current layout in the 18th century, by royal order of Queen Mary I of Portugal due to the importance that Póvoa de Varzim got as the main seaport in Northern Portugal.\n\nDowntown is limited to the North by Bairro Norte, to the south by Bairro Sul, to the east by Barreiros/Moninhas and Matriz/Mariadeira and to the west it borders Redonda Beach and Póvoa Cove.\n\nDowntown Póvoa de Varzim is, to a large extent, made up of pedestrian areas, with difficult car access in much of its extension, although underground parking spaces are available in the waterfront and in Avenida Mouzinho de Albuquerque.\n\nPraça do Almada, the civic center, is landscaped in an egg-shape, cut in half by the National Highway 13, and is tipped by buildings with local style. The building of the City Hall (1791) dominates the square. In the square, the Manueline pillory of Póvoa de Varzim (1514) is a national monument and represents Póvoa de Varzim's self-government and laws. Next to the pillory, the romantic gazebo (1904) follows the liking of the old Povoan bourgeoisie for its spare time.\n\nDespite being pedestrian, Rua da Junqueira is the most famous and elder of those three streets. Junqueira, which links Praça do Almada to the waterfront, appeared in the written records in 1694, even though artifacts from the Roman era surfaced in diverse street rearrangements and is the site of an ancient Roman fish factory. In 1839, the Town Hall expressed concerns over urbanization issues due to popularity of this street, one of the busiest in Póvoa de Varzim, as it became in that century a full-blown shopping street, identity that it maintained to these days in which ancient stores survive.\n\nUndersized but charismatic squares in Junqueira district, between Praça do Almada and Passeio Alegre (waterfront) can be found: Praça da República and Largo David Alves.\n\nFrom the surroundings of Praça do Almada, three parallel streets lead to the waterfront: Rua Tenente Valadim, that ends between the Casino and Grande Hotel, Rua da Junqueira and Rua Santos Minho. The later is related to the arts, most notably performing arts, since the 18th century. It was a square known as Campo das Cobras and the location of a theater since 1793, the local bullfighting arena and circus. The old building Salão Teatro (Theater Saloon) and Teatro Garrett Theater from the 19th century, with small artist's studios in the way, can still be found.\n\nAlbeit inhabited since the Roman period, with Roman fish factories and a Roman villa. The seaport, a natural harbor, appeared in the written records in the 11th century, and the ship-making industry developed considerably in the 17th century, it was in the 18th century, with the fishing industry getting national importance, that defined the city center as it is today, with the Royal Provision by Queen Mary I on February 21, 1791. The queen ordered \"Corregedor\" Almada to reorganize the town's layout given Póvoa's prosperity and importance in the fishing sector. Prior to development the area had lagoons in the port area such as Boído Lagoon and Galé Lagoon.\n\nThe new civic center (\"Praça Nova\" - New Square) with a new town hall was built in an area used as a market square during some periods in the site of Boído Lagoon. The square was later renamed Praça do Almada in honor of Corregedor Almada efforts. The new square replaced the old town hall around Praça Velha, the Old civic center.\n\nPrior to that, Junqueira district was already a bustling fishing quarter. As the 19th century moved in, and beach therapy became popular with the elites, Junqueira became a bourgeois shopping street.\n\nIn late 19th century and under the visions of David Alves, when Póvoa de Varzim was already a prosperous beach resort, sections of the urbanized area, which didn't grew in an orderly way, were demolished to give way for Mousinho de Albuquerque Avenue, linking Passeio Alegre Square to uptown's Dores Square (\"Largo das Dores\"), where mansions for the wealthy beach goers started being built. During late 20th century, some of the mansions and \"Orfeão Poveiro\" music hall ruins were destroyed to give rise to multifamily homes. Despite its losses, Mousinho Avenue got a new character, it became a central business avenue and a rehabilitation program was done in the 21st century.\n\nAround Rego Square, later David Alves square, appeared some of the most charismatic entertainment venues of Póvoa in the 19th century, the Hotel Luso-Brazileiro, the Chinês Saloon, Garrett Theater, and other entertainment venues. Centering the plaza, the Chinês Saloon appeared in 1882 and became popular all over the country and the most famous casino of Póvoa alongside Café David. The elites could listen to music, see shows with Spanish dancers, meet in tertulia and play roulette.\n\nOld bourgeois area par excellence, with the increasing business importance of Junqueira and Praça do Almada, whose spaces had been taken for tertiary activities such as shops and offices, in such a way that, today, only few people live in the most central areas of the city.\n"}

The animals were quarantined at the zoo then transferred to Hättö. The herd gradually began to increase and was in the late 1940s about 30 individuals.\n\n"}

Born in Nelson in 1847, Allan and his family moved to Wellington for several years and to Port Levy in 1851. The Allan family later settled in Lyttelton. Robert's father (also Robert) and uncle Magnus Allan were in business with John Grubb and notably were commissioned to construct the Canterbury Association wharf at Lyttelton for Captain Joseph Thomas.\n\nAllan was educated at the Church of England School under later at the Scots School. Joining the firm of J. T. Peacock & Co. at 15, Allan began a prosperous mercantile career. In the early 1870s he founded together with Mr Lightband, the boot and shoe manufacturers and general importers Lightband, Allan & Co. This firm later became the national concern of Skelton, Frostick and Co. Ltd which was famous for manufacturing Zealandia brand boots. In 1895 the firm erected a substantial four story brick building in Hereford Street, Christchurch which was the largest boot factory in the Colony. After Allan's retirement and subsequent death, Skelton Frostick fell victim to the difficult conditions of the Great Depression and was liquidated in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1900, Allan was president of both the Industrial Association and of the Jubilee Exhibition committee for Canterbury. He was appointed a Royal Reception Commissioner for the visit of the 1901 visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary) along with Sir Henry Wigram and Mr. Stead. Allan was also active in the Canterbury Chamber of Commerce, and one of the earliest members and the first treasurer of Christchurch's Union Rowing Club. He was a longtime director of the Kaiapoi Woollen Company, as well as electric lighting and tramway enterprises.\n\nAllan, in personal capacity and in his role as director was heavily involved in the promotional exhibitions of New Zealand made products. As President of the Industrial Association (1879-1881) he presided over the first Christchurch Industrial Exhibition in 1880. He was on the committee of the 1883 exhibition and in 1895 Robert had been elected a life member of the Association. He was appointed chairman of the Early History Committee of the Association. In 1900 Allan was President of both the Industrial Association and of the 1900 Jubilee Exhibition Committee.\n\nAllan's role and experience in exhibitions made him a natural choice for one of the Executive Commissioners of the New Zealand International Exhibition in 1906. G. S. Munro has been named as Government representative and Chairman of commissioners and Robert Allan named Vice-Chairman. Other commissioners included Sir John Hall (Mayor of Christchurch) and Mr. William Reece (ex-Mayor). It appears that Munro's dictatorial approach and treatment of his fellow commissioners took a serious toll on the organising committee and it is likely that in frustration Allan withdrew from the commission, sighting ill health as the reason. The Colonist of 11 August 1906 stated that Sir Joseph Ward had accepted Robert Allan's resignation. Though careful not to ascribe outright blame to Munro, the media were not fooled by the Allan's diplomatic resignation and pursued the matter that became known as \"The Exhibition Trouble.’ `Sir Joseph Ward was forced to investigate the matter further.\n\nOn 14 April 1869 Allan was married to Martha Haswell Wood at St Michaels Church, Merivale by the Very Rvd. Dean Jacobs. The couple had five daughters and two sons. In 1881 Allan had purchased Glenmore in Hillsborough, Opawa from John Chapman who had bought the house the previous year from John Barton Arudnel Acland of Mt Peel station. The house was built for Henry Selfe who was agent for the Canterbury Association but was rarely used by the first owner himself. Today, Glenmore is a Category II listed home by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.\n\nAllan later purchased Abberley in Springfield Avenue, St Albans, Christchurch. Abberley had been built in 1863 by well known importer and merchant Thomas James Maling (1836-1922). It was a substantial home with vast gardens — including a caged cherry orchard. The two hectare private garden is today the grounds of Abberley Park. The house was demolished in the 1930s after the City Council purchased the property. Allan also owned rural land in Canterbury, Northland and a sawmill at Tarawhiti. One of the properties at Nukutawhiti, Whangerai, was farmed by his son Robert S Allan. Robert Allan was staying at Nukatawhiti, his son’s sheep station in Northland, at the time of his death in 1927. Martha and Robert Allan are buried in the Bromley Cemetery, Christchurch.\n\n\n"}

He also performed a considerable amount of philanthropic work, benefiting his home city of Dundee and more widely Scottish education.\n\nBaxter was the second son of William Baxter, of Balgavies, Angus, and was born in Dundee on 15 February 1793. He was educated at the Dundee Academy.\n\nWhile still a young man, he became manager of the Dundee Sugar Refining Company. The concern was never prosperous, and notwithstanding his prudent and energetic management it collapsed in 1826. \n\nThereupon he became partner in the linen manufacturing firm of Baxter brothers, which included his father William and his two younger brothers. William had begun business with a mill in Glamis and in 1822 had started business in dundee with his eldest son Edward, who left the company in 1825 to commence the business of a general merchant. From the time that David Baxter joined the firm he was practically its head, and on the death of his two brothers and his father within a few years afterwards he and the former manager of the works Peter Carmichael remained the sole partners. They were later joined by William Ogilvie Dalgleish, who was married to David Baxter's niece.\n\nIn 1828 an attempt had been made by him to introduce power-loom weaving, but after a short trial it was abandoned until 1836, when its revival was followed by complete and extraordinary success. Through the mechanical skill of his partner Peter Carmichael in perfecting the machinery, and the business capacity and tact of David Baxter, the firm speedily became one of the largest manufacturing houses in the world; and to its remarkable success may be in a large degree ascribed the position which Dundee attained as the chief seat of the linen manufacture in Britain in the nineteenth century.\n\nSir David Baxter was also a partner in Turnbull & Co, later Boase & Co, which operated a bleachfield at Claverhouse, and was later fully taken over by Baxter Brothers.\n\nAlthough much immersed in the cares of business, Baxter took an active, if not very prominent, share in public affairs. In 1825 he was chosen a police commissioner, and in 1828 a guild councillor and member of the harbour board. A liberal in politics, he took a lively interest in parliamentary elections, both in Dundee and in the county of Fife, where in 1856 he purchased the estate of Kilmaron.\n\nHis enlightened regard for the welfare of his native town was, however, manifested chiefly in noble and generous benefactions which have given his name one of the highest places of honour in its annals. The most notable of these was perhaps his presentation, along with his sisters, of thirty-eight acres of land to Dundee as a pleasure garden and recreation ground, which, under the name of the Baxter Park, was opened by Earl Russell in September 1863. A £20,000 bequest on his death in 1872 led to the foundation of a mechanics' institute in 1888. Known then as the Dundee Technical Institute, it was the fore-runner of Abertay University.\n\nThe foundation of the Albert Institute of Literature, Science, and Art (now the McManus Galleries) was due also chiefly to his liberality and that of his relatives; and in connection with Dundee Royal Infirmary he erected a convalescent home at Broughty Ferry at a cost of £30,000. \n\nMore important than his benefactions to Dundee were his gifts in behalf of higher education in Scotland. Besides building and endowing at Cupar, Fife a seminary for the education of young ladies, he established several important foundations in the University of Edinburgh, including scholarships in mathematics, philosophy, physical science, and natural science, each of the annual value of £60; and a chair of engineering, with an endowment of £5,000, which was supplemented by an annual parliamentary vote of £200. \n\nOn 24 January 1863 he was created a baronet 'of Kilmaron in the County of Fife'.\n\nSoon thereafter he acquired 5 Moray Place, a huge Georgian townhouse on the Moray Estate in western Edinburgh.\n\nHe died 13 October 1872. Of Baxter's heritable and personal property, valued at £1,200,000, one half was divided among near relatives, and the other among distant relations and public institutions, the largest legacies being £50,000 to the Free Church of Scotland, £40,000 pounds to Edinburgh University, and £20,000 towards the foundation of a mechanics' institute in Dundee, later Abertay University.\n\nBefore his last illness Baxter's attention was occupied with a scheme for linking Dundee with the neighbouring University of St. Andrews, and although he did not survive to carry out his plans, his relatives helped found University College, Dundee. Towards the purchase of buildings and general equipment of this college one of his sisters Mary Ann Baxter who died unmarried on 19 December 1884, contributed £150,000.\n\nIn 1833 Baxter married to Elizabeth (1801-1882), daughter of R. Montgomerie, of Barrahill, Ayrshire. Elizabeth survived him, and they had no children. She was buried with him in the old churchyard in the centre of Cupar in Fife, just west of the church.\n\nAttribution:\n"}

The Softwarepark Hagenberg is a unique collaboration where research, business and education are intensively cooperating. Because of its success, the park has been called the \"Wunder von Hagenberg\" (miracle from Hagenberg).\n\nBuchberger devised the concept for the park in 1989. It was created to balance both economic needs and desire for research and as such, the concept focused one third on economic production, one third on research and one third on academic education in the field of IT and related sciences. These three components drive a synergetic \"spirale of innovation\". Softwarepark has four main partners: The Province of Upper Austria, the Johannes Kepler University Linz, the Community of Hagenberg, and Raiffeisen Landesbank Oberösterreich, a major local bank. The first institute to be established in the park was Buchberger's Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC) with then 25 students and employees.\n\nToday Softwarepark is increasing its international activities, e.g. with ISI - International Studies in Informatics Hagenberg or the recently launched International Incubator Hagenberg.\n\nWithin the twenty years of its existence, 100 million € were invested into developing the park.\n\nThe park currently houses 50 companies with more than 1000 employees as well as more than 1400 students of a number of universities and colleges, amongst them the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation, and the Software Competence Center Hagenberg SCCH funded by the Austrian COMET program.\n\nAdditionally, the park houses a social project for people with disabilities to provide computer support in cooperation with the Diakonisches Werk Gallneukirchen and the Fachhochschule Hagenberg.\n\nThe current expansion schedule plans to expand the park with 20 million € in funds until 2012, with the expansion of the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation as well as a hotel, sport arenas and an international student union building.

It examines how Israel, a 60-year-old nation with a population of 7.1 million, was able to reach such economic growth that \"at the start of 2009, some 63 Israeli companies were listed on the NASDAQ, more than those of any other foreign country.\"\n\nIn 2010, \"Start-up Nation\" was ranked fifth on the business bestseller list of \"The New York Times\". It also reached \"The Wall Street Journal\" bestseller list.\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations states in its publisher's blurb for the book that \"Start-up Nation\" addresses the question: \"How is it that Israel—a country of 7.1 million people, only sixty years old, surrounded by enemies, in a constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources—produces more start-up companies than large, peaceful, and stable nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada, and the United Kingdom?\" \"The Economist\" notes that Israel now has more high-tech start-ups and a larger venture capital industry per capita than any other country in the world. The success of Israel's high-tech sector over the past two decades has attracted recent attention from business journalists and \"The Economist\" describes \"Start-up Nation\" as the most notable of a \"growing pile\" of books on the subject.\n\nIn their attempt to explain Israel's success in this area, Senor and Singer discard \"the argument from ethnic or religious exceptionalism, dismissing 'unitary Jewishness' or even individual talent as major reasons for Israel's high-tech success\" and analyze two major factors that, in the authors' opinion, contribute most to Israel's economic growth. Those factors are mandatory military service and immigration.\n\nThe authors argue that a major factor for Israel's economic growth can be found in the culture of the Israel Defense Forces, in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors believe that IDF service provides potential entrepreneurs with the opportunities to develop a wide array of skills and contacts. They also believe that IDF service provides experience exerting responsibility in a relatively un-hierarchical environment where creativity and intelligence are highly valued. IDF soldiers \"have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules. If you're a junior officer, you call your higher-ups by their first names, and if you see them doing something wrong, you say so.\" Neither ranks nor ages matter much \"when taxi drivers can command millionaires and 23-year-olds can train their uncles,\" and \"Israeli forces regularly vote to oust their unit leaders.\"\n\nThe book also dwells at length on immigration and its role in Israel's economic growth: \"Immigrants are not averse to start from scratch. They are by definition risk-takers. A nation of immigrants is a nation of entrepreneurs. From survivors of the Holocaust to Soviet refuseniks through the Ethiopian Jews, the State of Israel never ceased to be a land of immigration: 9 out of 10 Jewish Israelis today are immigrants or descendants of immigrants the first or second generation. This specific demographic, causing fragmentation of community that still continues in the country, is nevertheless a great incentive to try their luck, to take risks because immigrants have nothing to lose.\"\n\nAdditional factors cited by the authors include a sense of dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, a culture where individuals frequently tinker with technology, and government policies friendly to start-ups.\n\nUsing stories and anecdotes, the book provides examples of Israel's technological and medical achievements, among them \"the Israeli innovations that made possible Google Suggest, the list of suggestions that appear instantly in menu form as you type a search request, the capsule endoscopy, a miniature camera embedded in a pill so that 18 photos per second can be wirelessly and painlessly transmitted from gastrointestinal tracts.\"\n\nWhile the book describes Israel's many successes in technological innovation, it also attempts to address, in the words of one reviewer, why Israel still lacks its own Nokia, Samsung, or IBM. According to the book's authors, this is partly because Israeli startups tend to be bought up by large foreign companies and partly because Israeli business has thus far failed to develop the kind of mature management culture needed to run such companies.\n\nSenor and Singer interviewed over 100 people to write the book, among them leading Israeli venture investors including key players in Google, Intel, and Cisco; and historians, U.S. military leaders, and Israeli heads of state. Their conclusion is that \"while Israel has much to learn from the world, the world has much to learn from Israel.\"\n\nDan Senor is a former foreign policy official in the United States government. He served as chief spokesmen for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and now advises venture capital firms. Saul Singer is a columnist and former editorial page editor for \"The Jerusalem Post\".\n\nJon Rosen OF \"USA Today\" believes that the book is written from an Israeli perspective and may irk those with reservations about Israeli foreign policy, but it is still an accomplishment, \"not simply for exposing the roots of Israel's success, but by showing what the Israeli case might teach the rest of the world.\" In \"The Wall Street Journal\", James K. Glassman says that \"the greatest strength of \"Start-up Nation\" is not analysis but anecdote. The authors tell vivid stories of entrepreneurial success, such as that of Shai Agassi, the son of an Iraqi immigrant to Israel, with his electric-automobile technology, now in the process of creating 'Car 2.0.'\"\n\n\"Publishers Weekly\" states that \"the authors ground their analysis in case studies and interviews with some of Israel's most brilliant innovators to make this a rich and insightful read not just for business leaders and policy makers but for anyone curious about contemporary Israeli culture.\"\n\nIn \"The Economic Times\", R Gopalakrishnan writes that the use of Hebrew expressions makes the book \"alive and eminently-readable.\" Besides \"chutzpah\", the authors use the word \"bitzua\", which roughly means \"getting things done.\" Another Hebrew expression used in the book is \"rosh gadol\", literally \"big head\", which could be translated \"can-do and responsible attitude with scant respect for the limitations of formal authority.\" Gopalakrishnan concludes that the ideas demonstrated in the book \"are highly relevant for innovation capability in general, but for India, especially at this juncture.\"\n\nDavid Horovitz of \"The Jerusalem Post\" says that conclusions of \"Start-up Nation\" find confirmation in the real world, such as how the life of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was saved when an emergency medical team applied a revolutionary elasticized bandage developed in Israel to staunch her head wounds.\n\nA review in \"The Washington Post\" says that \"the book weaves together colorful stories of Israeli technological triumphs\" such as the story of Shvat Shaked, who \"founded a cybersecurity firm with his old buddy from Army intelligence and had the chutzpah to bet a top executive at PayPal, the online commerce company owned by eBay, that his few dozen engineers could beat PayPal's thousands in developing secure online software.\" The review also states that the authors could have done a better job drawing \"straight lines between their theories about Israel's success and these case studies\".\n\nMaureen Farrell of \"Forbes\" was disappointed that the authors mostly ignored the effects of U.S. foreign aid, but says the book \"is worth reading to understand not just Israel's history but the history of capitalism and innovation.\"\n\nRuth Schuster, reviewing the book for \"Haaretz\", feels that it is \"tarnished by a jarring, tub-thumping patriotism.\" A review in \"The Christian Science Monitor\" notes that \"critics say that the story behind how a country of 7 million has more Nasdaq-listed companies than Europe is more complex than Singer and Senor paint it to be.\"\n\nEconomist Yusuf Mansur, writing in the \"Jordan Times\", argues that two of the factors to which Senor and Singer attribute Israel's success, the IDF and Soviet-Jewish immigration, have only been sustainable because of the foreign aid that Israel receives from the United States and private sources. Mansur also faults the authors for suggesting that the disparity between entrepreneurship in Israel's Arab and Jewish sectors is rooted in the exemption of Arabs from military service rather than what Mansour perceives to be \"the discriminatory policies of Israel against its Arab citizens,\" particularly in education and the labor market.\n\nGal Beckerman, writing in \"The Forward\" magazine, observes that the book \"presents Israel in an extremely positive light as a bastion of entrepreneurial spirit and technological achievement. It skirts a discussion of the conflict with the Palestinians, or even the wealth inequality within Israel, thereby dovetailing nicely with recent public relations efforts by Israel to shift attention away from its problems and toward its achievements.\"\n\nJournalists and policymakers in several countries have recommended \"Start-up Nation\" as a useful guide for promoting entrepreneurship. A review of the book in \"The Irish Times\" calls on Ireland to follow Israel's model. Andrius Kubilius, the prime minister of Lithuania, has cited \"Start-up Nation\" as his favorite book. Yrjö Ojasaar, managing partner of Solon Partners, an executive consulting and angel investor company in Estonia, says \"there is much to be learned from the Israeli experience of venture capital incubation through building incentives for privatization.\" CNN's Fareed Zakaria called \"Start-up Nation\" \"a book every single Arab businessman, Arab bureaucrat, and Arab politician should read.\" The book is cited as a handbook of \"classic economics.\" It teaches small businesses \"how effective a cohesive team can be, especially when that team places an emphasis on chutzpah first.\"\n\nPalestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad reportedly keeps a copy of \"Start-up Nation\" on his desk as a source of inspiration for the West Bank's own burgeoning technology industry.\n\n\n"}

The building is most notable as the vantage point of the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. An employee, Lee Harvey Oswald, allegedly shot and killed Kennedy from a sixth floor window on the building's southeastern corner. The structure is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. It is located at 411 Elm Street on the northwest corner of Elm and North Houston Streets, at the western end of downtown Dallas.\n\nThe site of the building was originally owned by John Neely Bryan. During the 1880s, Maxime Guillot operated a wagon shop on the property. In 1894, the Rock Island Plow Company bought the land, and four years later constructed a five-story building for its Texas division, the Southern Rock Island Plow Company. In 1901, the building was hit by lightning and nearly burned to the ground. It was rebuilt in 1902 in the Commercial Romanesque Revival style, and expanded to seven stories. In 1937 the property was acquired by the Carraway Byrd Corporation, and after the company defaulted on the loan, it was bought at public auction July 4, 1939 by D. Harold Byrd.\n\nUnder Byrd's ownership the building remained empty until 1940, when it was leased by a grocery wholesaler, the John Sexton & Co. Sexton Foods used this location as the branch office for sales, manufacturing and distribution warehouse for the south and southwest United States. In November 1961, Sexton Foods moved to a modern distribution facility located at 650 Regal Row Dallas; by then the building was known locally as the Sexton Building. Refurbishment after Sexton's departure saw the addition on the first four floors of partitions, carpeting, air conditioning and a new passenger elevator.\n\nIn 1963, the building was in use as a multi-floor warehouse providing the storage of school textbooks and other related materials as well as an order-fulfillment center by the privately owned Texas School Book Depository Company. Some time after the company had moved in, it was found that the upper floors had sustained oil damage from items stored there by the previous tenant, a wholesaler grocer. To protect the company's books (stored in cardboard boxes) from oil seeping up from the floor, a process to cover the floors with plywood had begun. Immediately before the President Kennedy's visit to Dallas, work on the west side of the sixth floor had started, \"leaving the whole scene in disarray, with stock shifted as far as the east wall, and stacks in between piled unusually high.\"\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former U.S. Marine who was working as a temporary employee at the building, fired three shots from a sixth floor window at the presidential motorcade, killing President John F. Kennedy.\n\nIn addition to its building at Elm and Houston, the Texas School Book Depository Company maintained a second warehouse at 1917 Houston. Several blocks north of the main building, the short four-story structure was well removed from the parade route, half-hidden on an unpaved section of Houston. Oswald's supervisor, Roy Truly, told the Warren Commission that he had had the option to assign Oswald to either building on his first day at work. \"I might have sent Oswald to work [there]... Oswald and another fellow reported for work on the same day [October 15] and I needed one of them for the depository building. I picked Oswald.\" This second building was eventually destroyed to make way for the Woodall Rodgers Freeway.\n\nDuring his two terms as mayor of Dallas, Wes Wise guided Dallas out from under the cloud of the assassination and at the same time saved the Texas School Book Depository from imminent destruction, preserving it for further research into the president's murder.\n\nThe Texas School Book Depository Company moved out in 1970 and the building was sold at auction to Aubrey Mayhew, a Nashville, Tennessee music producer and collector of Kennedy memorabilia, by the owner D. H. Bard. In 1972, ownership reverted to Bard, and the building was purchased in 1977 by the government of Dallas County. After renovating the lower five floors of the building for use as county government offices, the Dallas County Administration Building was dedicated on March 29, 1981.\n\nOn President's Day 1989, the sixth floor opened to the public (for an admission charge) as the Sixth Floor Museum of assassination-related exhibits. On President's Day 2002, the seventh-floor gallery opened. The gallery opened on February 18, 2002 with the exhibit: \"The Pulitzer Prize Photographs: Capture the Moment\". A $2.5 million renovation turned the storage area on the seventh floor into a new gallery space for the museum. Other exhibits that have hung in the space include the works Andy Warhol.\n\nOn May 4, 2010, burglars attempted to steal a safe from the Sixth Floor Museum, but fled when \"they were confronted by a security guard,\" leaving the unopened safe suspended from a winch on the back of a truck.\n\n\n"}

In addition to RVMs, TOMRA manufactures compactors, material recovery, and sorting machinery.\nWith over 70,000 RVMs installed worldwide, TOMRA is the leading provider in the industry.\n\nTOMRA is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSEBX) under the ticker symbol TOM. The parent company, Tomra Systems ASA, is headquartered in Asker, Norway, with central departments located in Mülheim-Kärlich, Germany and Shelton, Connecticut.\n\nTOMRA was founded by the two brothers Tore and Petter Planke in 1972. It started out with the design, manufacturing and sale of reverse vending machines (RVMs) for automated collection of used beverage containers. Through 70s a breakthrough for Tomra was in 1974 where the Swedish entity Systembolaget ordered 100 RVMs.\n\nTOMRA was listed in Oslo Børs on 18 January 1985 and tried to secure a position in the American market to no avail. It was then successfully attempted to enter the market in 1990s. By 1999, sales in the US accounted for more than half of total revenues. In 2006, TOMRA delivered more than 8000 new reverse vending systems to Germany.\n\nTOMRA's sensor-based sorting technology business was first established in 2004 with the acquisition of \"TiTech Visionsort AS\", a provider of optical recognition and sorting technology (which was renamed to \"Tomra Sorting Solutions\" in 2012), from \"Ferd AS\" for 219 million NOK.\n\nWith the acquisition of \"Orwak\" in 2005, TOMRA established itself as a producer of compaction and baling solutions with an installed base of more than 67,000 balers. In December 2014, TOMRA sold the \"Orwak\" operations in Norway, Sweden, Poland and Japan under the name \"TOMRA Compaction\" to \"San Sac Nordic AB\" of Sweden.\n\nAs of August 31, 2005, \"TOMRA Latasa Reciclagem S.A.\", offering aluminium can collection and recycling assets services in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, was acquired by Aleris International, Inc.\n\nOn 1 July 2006, TOMRA’s subsidiary \"Titech Visionsort AS\" acquired 100 percent of the shares of Germany-based \"CommoDaS GmbH\", a provider of recognition and sorting technology for metals, plastics, glass, minerals and gems, for approximately 100 million NOK.\n\nOn 1 Juli 2008 TOMRA announced it bought Australian peer \"Ultrasort Group\", a provider of advanced recognition and sorting technology to the mining industry, for 160 million NOK ($31.48 million).\n\nVia several acquisitions, TOMRA had grown into a global company since the 2000s and secured 75% global market share in RVMs and 60% Material Recovery from Collection Solutions and 40%-65% in Sorting Solutions.\n\nOn 12 December 2010, TOMRA's subsidiary \"TiTech\" acquired Dublin-based food technology company \"Odenberg\", a designer of equipment used for producing 65 per cent of all French fries worldwide, for up to 57.5 million Euro from \"ACT Venture Capital\" in Dublin and members of the Van den Bergh family in Belgium; Odenberg's chilling/freezing unit was later considered a non-core business and sold in 2013 as to a newly formed company, \"Power Food Technology Ltd.\", of Ireland.\n\nOn 31 December 2011, TOMRA sold the assets of \"Tomra Pacific, Inc.\", a recycler of used beverage containers in California, to \"rePlanet, LLC\" for approximately $25 million.\n\nIn June 2012, TOMRA purchased 100% of Belgium-based food sorting specialist \"Best Kwadraat\" for 138 million Euro.\n\nIn October 2016 TOMRA signed an agreement to acquire \"Compac Holding Ltd.,\" a New Zealand-based provider of packing house automation systems that sort fresh produce based on weight, size, shape, color, surface blemishes, and internal quality, for $70 million plus up to $230 million in earn-outs available to Compac founders; the transaction was completed in March 2017.\n\nIn 2001, the EU Commission performed an investigation of Tomra’s competition law compliance. Based on this investigation, the Commission concluded in March 2006 that TOMRA in their opinion had foreclosed competition in the period 1998 to 2002 in the market for reverse vending machines in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden by implementing an exclusionary strategy. TOMRA appealed the decision to the European General Court in 2006.\n\nIn September 2010, the Court issued their judgment where they dismissed Tomra’s appeal both on the substance and on the amount of the fine. TOMRA consequently accrued 28.2 million Euro (NOK 226.1 million) for the fine and accumulated interest in the third quarter financial statement for 2010. TOMRA appealed this decision again but finally lost the case in April 2012.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37123191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37123191", "title": "Tone at the top", "text": "Tone at the top\n\n\"Tone at the top\" is a term that originated in the field of accounting and is used to describe an organization's general ethical climate, as established by its board of directors, audit committee, and senior management. Having good tone at the top is believed by business ethics experts to help prevent fraud and other unethical practices.\n\nThe concept of tone at the top originated in audit firms, where it referred fairly narrowly to the attitude of an organization's senior leadership towards internal financial controls. It was popularized following a series of major corporate accounting scandals such as those affecting Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, Peregrine Systems and WorldCom, when the concept was strongly emphasized in the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 as important in the prevention and detection of fraud and other unethical financial practices. Today the term is applied very broadly, including in the fields of general management, information security, law and software development, and is often used to describe the general corporate culture established by an organization's leadership.\n\nThe tone at the top is often considered to permeate an entire organization, and good tone at the top is considered a prerequisite for solid corporate governance. It has been said that boards of directors have a dual role: creating codes of conduct, and living by them.\n\nGood organizational tone is set through policies, codes of ethics, a commitment to hiring competent employees, and the development of reward structures that promote good internal controls and effective governance. In an analysis of ethical leadership, KPMG described ethical leaders as those who are receptive to employees' ethical concerns, value ethics and integrity over short-term business goals, and respond appropriately if they become aware of misconduct.\n\nAuditors typically interview an organization's leaders as part of the audit fieldwork in order to assess tone at the top, because poor tone is associated with malfeasance. Questions commonly asked include \"how is the board compensated,\" \"how active is the audit committee,\" \"what is the nature of the organization's corporate culture,\" \"what pressures are there to make sales and earnings goals,\" \"how is wrong-doing dealt with,\" \"do employees understand their individual responsibilities for controls,\" \"do monitoring controls signal failures in a timely fashion so corrective action can be taken,\" and \"is there evidence that the employee code of ethics is complied with.\"\n\nImportant fraud factors include pressure to reach goals, incentives and meeting expectations.\n\nExperts say that weaknesses in the \"tone at the top\" have been associated with most modern financial frauds. Poor tone at the top may include a disdain for internal controls, an overemphasis on profits at the expense of ethics, a belief that compliance with the law is sufficient for defensible ethical conduct, the canvassing and accommodating of some stakeholders but not others, blaming higher-ups or colleagues for unethical practices, having one's judgement clouded due to conflicts of interest, and a misunderstanding of and lack of adherence to public expectations of what constitutes ethical behaviour for executives. Backdating stock options and pegging the granting of options to significant good or bad corporate announcements (known as spring-loading and bullet-dodging) are compensation practices that can be indicative of poor tone at the top.\n\nThe Enron scandal, revealed in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the de facto dissolution of Arthur Andersen, its audit firm. Enron is considered to be the largest bankruptcy reorganization in U.S. history, as well as the biggest audit failure. Executives at Enron used accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and misleading financial reporting to hide billions in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Andersen to ignore the issues. The Enron story demonstrated many common features of failed tone at the top, including inappropriate hostility to critics and a misunderstanding of public expectations. In a conference call on April 17, 2001, after Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman complained that Enron wasn't releasing a balance sheet along with its financial statements, then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling responded \"Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that ... asshole,\" a phrase that was met with dismay and astonishment by the media and public, but which became an inside joke among many Enron employees.\n\nArthur Andersen was criticized for being the only Big 5 audit firm to allow the partner in charge of an audit to override a ruling made by the quality control partner, and was found guilty in 2002 of obstruction of justice for shredding documents related to its audit of Enron, resulting in the Enron scandal. The Arthur Andersen story is now used in business ethics textbooks as an example of a failure of tone at the top, for emphasizing profitability over high ethical standards. \"See also Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States and the Enron scandal.\"\n\nIn 2002, Xerox was fined $10 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly deceiving the public between 1997 and 2000 by employing several \"accounting maneuvers,\" with six Xerox senior executives paying another $22 million in 2003. The SEC charged that former CEO Paul Allaire and his second-in-command G. Richard Thoman, who were among the six fined, \"set a tone at the top of the company which equated business success with meeting short-term earnings targets.\"\n\nBusiness experts say that although the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), colloquially known as Fannie Mae, gave the appearance of setting the appropriate tone at the top, its actual conduct fell short. In 2004, Fannie Mae was investigated by the U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), which alleged widespread accounting errors. In 2008 Fannie Mae was embroiled in several conflict of interest scandals, and in 2011 six of its executives, including 2005-2008 Fannie Mae CEO Daniel Mudd, were charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with securities fraud. In May 2006, OFHEO released a \"Report of the Special Examination of Fannie Mae\" which argued that at Fannie Mae \"earnings mattered, but not how they were achieved,\" and which blamed \"the actions and inactions of the Board of Directors [which] inappropriately reinforced rather than checked the tone and culture set by [1999-2004 Fannie Mae CEO Franklin] Raines and other senior managers.\" Former OFHEA head Armando Falcon attributed Fannie Mae's problems to \"the arrogance and huge egos of senior management,\" saying \"it was always just groupthink and if you ever raised a dissenting voice, your career would be over. Ego and arrogance was visible everywhere, in everything the company did: how it treated counterparties in the marketplace it dealt in, how it was able to throw its weight around politically, the way it spent money to curry political loyalty, the arrogance that permeated everything that the company did, including ultimately the accounting misconduct, and the lack of any kind of corporate ethics.\" \"See also the 2004 Fannie Mae accounting controversy, the Countrywide Financial political loan scandal and Friends of Angelo VIP program, and the 2011 Fannie Mae SEC charges.\"\n\nThe 2007–2012 global financial crisis, considered by many economists to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, was investigated by the U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which concluded that \"the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve’s failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels,\" and laid the blame for the crisis with government and regulatory leaders and CEOs of the failed companies, saying \"tone at the top does matter and, in this instance, we were let down. No one said 'no'.\"\n\nFormer chairman and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark H. Swartz were accused of the theft of more than $150 million from the company. During their trial in March 2004, they contended the board of directors authorized it as compensation.\n\nDuring jury deliberations, juror Ruth Jordan, while passing through the courtroom, appeared to make an \"okay\" sign with her fingers to the defense table. She later denied she had intended that gesture, but the incident received much publicity (including a caricature in \"The Wall Street Journal\"), and the juror received threats after her name became public. Judge Michael Obus declared a mistrial on April 2, 2004.\n\nOn June 17, 2005, after a retrial, Kozlowski and Swartz were convicted on all but one of the more than 30 counts against them. The verdicts carry potential jail terms of up to 25 years in state prison. Kozlowski himself was sentenced to no less than eight years and four months and no more than 25 years in prison. Swartz received the same sentence. Then in May 2007, New Hampshire Federal District Court Judge Paul Barbadoro approved a class action settlement whereby Tyco agreed to pay $2.92 billion (in conjunction with $225 million by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, their auditors) to a class of defrauded shareholders represented by Grant & Eisenhofer P.A., Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz & Kessler, and Milberg Weiss & Bershad.\n\nCEO Bernard Ebbers was accused of accounting fraud. Ebbers had become very wealthy from the rising price of his holdings in WorldCom common stock. However, in the year 2000, the telecommunications industry entered a downturn and WorldCom’s aggressive growth strategy suffered a serious setback when it was forced by the US Justice Department to abandon its proposed merger with Sprint in mid 2000. By that time, WorldCom’s stock price was declining and Ebbers came under increasing pressure from banks to cover margin calls on his WorldCom stock that was used to finance his other businesses (timber and yachting, among others). During 2001, Ebbers persuaded WorldCom’s board of directors to provide him corporate loans and guarantees in excess of $400 million to cover his margin calls. The board hoped that the loans would avert the need for Ebbers to sell substantial amounts of his WorldCom stock, as his doing so would put further downward pressure on the stock's price. However, this strategy ultimately failed and Ebbers was ousted as CEO in April 2002 and replaced by John Sidgmore, former CEO of UUNET Technologies, Inc.\n\nBeginning modestly in mid-year 1999 and continuing at an accelerated pace through May 2002, the company (under the direction of Ebbers, Scott Sullivan (CFO), David Myers (Comptroller) and Buford \"Buddy\" Yates (Director of General Accounting)) used fraudulent accounting methods to mask its declining earnings by painting a false picture of financial growth and profitability to prop up the price of WorldCom’s stock.\n\nThe fraud was accomplished primarily in two ways:\n\n\nIn 2002, a small team of internal auditors at WorldCom worked together, often at night and in secret, to investigate and unearth $3.8 billion in fraud. Shortly thereafter, the company’s audit committee and board of directors were notified of the fraud and acted swiftly: Sullivan was fired, Myers resigned, Arthur Andersen withdrew its audit opinion for 2001, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched an investigation into these matters on June 26, 2002 (see accounting scandals). By the end of 2003, it was estimated that the company's total assets had been inflated by around $11 billion.\n\nImClone's stock price dropped sharply at the end of 2001 when its drug Erbitux, an experimental monoclonal antibody, failed to get the expected Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. It was later revealed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that numerous executives sold their stock before the announcement of the decision after the close of trading on December 28.\n\nIts founder, Samuel D. Waksal, was arrested in 2002 on insider trading charges for informing friends and family to sell their stock, and attempting to sell his own. His daughter, Aliza Waksal, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 27. His father, Jack Waksal, sold $8.1 million in shares over the 27th and 28th. Company executives had done the same. John B. Landes, the general counsel, sold $2.5 million in shares on December 6. Ronald A. Martell, the vice president for marketing and sales, sold $2.1 million in shares on December 11. Four other executives sold shares in the following weeks as well. Later, Samuel Waksal pleaded guilty to various charges, including securities fraud, and on June 10, 2003, was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.\n"}

It originally premiered on HBO on May 21, 1994.\n\nDan Cutler, the head of an advertising agency, invites his colleagues to a whitewater rafting trip. The invitation feels more like an order to some, Cutler considering the outing a test of his employees' confidence, courage and skills. Retired agency executive Nick Karas is a last minute addition, wanting to help Cutler secure some clients and believing that it is a simple fishing trip.\n\nTragedy occurs along Canada's \"White Mile,\" when a canoe capsizes and several of Cutler's companions are swept away by the raging current. Two agency executives, retiree Karas and two clients die, and Cutler becomes at odds with Jack Robbins, one of his top executives, over how the aftermath should be portrayed to authorities and to relatives who are suing the company.\n\n\nThe film is loosely based on a rafting accident, on August 1, 1987, on the White Mile rapids in the Bidwell Canyon section of the Chilko River, in the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada. Current and retired executives of Chicago agency DDB Needham (DDB), along with clients from Kraft, Clorox, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Drug Free America Foundation (DFAF) and other major companies, were involved in the incident. Like the film, five men died that day—two current and one retired DDB executives, and one executive each from P&G and DFAF. As in the film, the court assigned a payout of $1.1 million to the family of the retired DDB executive who died that day.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26300734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26300734", "title": "World counseling system", "text": "World counseling system\n\nThe World Counseling System (WCS), otherwise called the Religious Counseling Standard, is a classification model developed for use mostly in religious counseling. It is a model commonly used for counseling in Africa, Asia and South America and it works on three assumptions:\n\n\nThis process involves the engagement of people with supernatural gifts such as prophets (in whatever religion) and faith-based counselors to help resolve the problem. The core of the model is that the person with the problem commits his or her case into the hands of the agent of a supernatural being who is expected to proffer solutions to the problem.\n\nOwing to the involvement of some supernatural being, the issues that can be resolved are unlimited, which makes categorization difficult. Categorization is based, therefore, on the personalities involved in the resolution process, rather than on the problems that need to be solved.\n\nUnder the WCS system, counseling is carried out in three categories:\nIf someone needs counseling in the area of personal relationship, he or she could seek help from the agents regarding a spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend or fiancée. He or she could ask such questions as \"Is my husband faithful?\" \"Is this person the right person for me to marry?\" and \"If I marry this person, will the marriage last?\" The online edition requires that you fill out a form. Information you need to supply includes your first name, the full name of the person you need information about, his or her mother's name and your question. When you send in your request, it is sent to at least two counselors. The agency using the WCS service will quickly prepare a composite report (from the two responses) which is sent back to you. The service comes at a fee since the WCS model has a copyright tied to it. An average response, which is usually more comprehensive than a typical on-line request, can take up to three hours before the reply is available. The response in a typical WCS service may have between 75 and 93 per cent accuracy in its predictions regarding the issue to be resolved.\n\nSimilar processes apply to the \"business\" and \"other\" categories. For business classification, the question might be something like \"I want to embark on this type of business. Will I succeed?\" \"Somebody wants to be my partner. Can this person be trusted?\" \"I want to obtain a loan from the bank. Will the loan bring profits?\" \"Will repayment of the loan be difficult?\" The \"other relationships\" category takes care of areas not covered by personal and business relationships.\n\n1.
