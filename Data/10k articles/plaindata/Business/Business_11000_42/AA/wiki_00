{"id": "481099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=481099", "title": "Adam Hochschild", "text": "Adam Hochschild\n\nAdam Hochschild (; born October 5, 1942) is an American author, journalist, historian and lecturer. His best-known works include \"King Leopold's Ghost\" (1998), \"To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914–1918\" (2011), \"Bury the Chains\" (2005), \"The Mirror at Midnight\" (1990), \"The Unquiet Ghost\" (1994), and \"Spain in Our Hearts\" (2016).\n\nHochschild was born in New York City. His father, Harold Hochschild, was of German Jewish descent; his mother, Mary Marquand Hochschild, was a WASP, and an uncle by marriage, Boris Sergievsky, was a World War I fighter pilot in the Imperial Russian Air Force.\n\nAdam graduated from Harvard in 1963 with a BA in History and Literature. As a college student, he spent a summer working on an anti-government newspaper in South Africa and subsequently worked briefly as a civil rights worker in Mississippi during 1964. Both were politically pivotal experiences about which he would eventually write in his books \"Half the Way Home: A Memoir of Father and Son\" and \"Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels.\" He later was part of the movement against the Vietnam War, and, after several years as a daily newspaper reporter, worked as a writer and editor for the left-wing \"Ramparts\" magazine. In the mid-1970s, he was one of the co-founders of \"Mother Jones\". Much of his writing has been about issues of human rights and social justice.\n\nA longtime lecturer at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, Hochschild has also been a Fulbright Lecturer in India, Regents' Lecturer at the University of California, Santa Cruz and Writer-in-Residence at the Department of History, University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He is married to sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild.\n\nHochschild's first book was a memoir, \"Half the Way Home: A Memoir of Father and Son\" (1986), in which he described the difficult relationship he had with his father. In \"The New York Times\", Michiko Kakutani called the book \"an extraordinarily moving portrait of the complexities and confusions of familial love.\"\n\nIn \"The Mirror at Midnight: A South African Journey\" (1990; new edition, 2007) he examines the tensions of modern South Africa through the prism of the nineteenth-century Battle of Blood River, which determined whether the Boers or the Zulus would control that part of the world, as well as looking at the contentious commemoration of the event by rival groups 150 years later, at the height of the apartheid era.\n\nIn \"The Unquiet Ghost: Russians Remember Stalin\" (1994; new edition, 2003), Hochschild chronicles the six months he spent in Russia, traveling to Siberia and the Arctic, interviewing gulag survivors, retired concentration camp guards, former members of the secret police and countless others about Joseph Stalin's reign of terror in the country, during which millions of people (the actual toll will never be known) died.\n\nHochschild's \"Finding the Trapdoor: Essays, Portraits, Travels\" (1997) collects his personal essays and shorter pieces of reportage, as does a more recent collection, \"Lessons from a Dark Time and Other Essays\" (2018).\n\nHis \"King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa\" (1998; new edition, 2006) is a history of the conquest of the Congo by King Léopold II of Belgium, and of the atrocities that were committed under Leopold's private rule of the colony, events that sparked the twentieth century's first great international human rights campaign. The book itself reignited contemporary interest and inquiry into the mystery surrounding Leopold's exploitative regime, yet has been subject to critical debate for its historical integrity, sensationalising the event, with Jean Stengers, a leading historian of the time, declaring, \"Terrible things happened, but Hochschild is exaggerating. It is absurd to say so many millions died.\"echoing critical sentiment that Hochoschild had exaggerated his depiction of the Congo atrocities.\n\nHochschild's \"\" (2005) is about the antislavery movement in the British Empire. The story of how abolitionists organized to change the mind of the British public about slavery has attracted attention from contemporary climate change activists, who see an analogy to their own work.\n\nIn 2011 Hochschild published \"To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914–1918\", which looks at the era of the First World War in terms of the struggle between those who felt the war was a noble crusade and those who felt it was not worth the sacrifice of millions of lives. His 2016 \"\" follows a dozen characters through that conflict, among them volunteer soldiers and medical workers, journalists who covered the war, and a little-known American oilman who sold Francisco Franco most of the fuel for his military. Hochschild's books have been translated into fourteen languages.\n\nHochschild has also written for the \"New Yorker\", \"Harper's Magazine\", \"The Atlantic\", \"Granta\", the \"Times Literary Supplement\", the \"New York Review of Books\", the \"New York Times Magazine\", and \"The Nation\" and other publications. He was also a commentator on National Public Radio's \"All Things Considered\".\n\nIn 2012, Hochschild was given an award for his work by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He and the other writers receiving awards at the Academy's annual ceremony were asked to write short statements about their work, to be part of an exhibit of their books and manuscripts.

He won 13 Gold Medal awards at the Chelsea Garden Show in London for this garden.\n\nHe was the son of Major John Congreve and Lady Helena Blanche Irene Ponsonby, the daughter of the Eighth Earl of Bessborough. As a businessman he ran Humphreys & Glasgow, the gasworks manufacturers and petrochemical engineers, from 1939, when he took over from Dr Arthur Glasgow, his father-in-law and a co-founder of the firm. He remained there until 1983, when the company was sold to an American concern. However, his abiding passion was gardening, especially at Mount Congreve, near Kilmeaden, County Waterford.\n\nThe Mount Congreve estate lies just outside the village of Kilmeadan. It is famous the world over for its rare species of plants and also its plant nurseries. It consists of around seventy acres of intensively planted woodland garden and a four-acre walled garden. In addition there are an 18th-century house (the ancestral home of Ambrose Congreve), ranges of glasshouses, more than 16 miles of paths and a wholesale nursery. After Congreve's death, aged 104 years, the Mount Congreve estate was left to the Irish State.\n\n"}

In 1758, van Braam arrived in China, and for the remaining eight years he was engage in trade in Guangzhou and Macau. During his sojourn in China, he left for Europe twice and married Catharina Cornelia Geertruida van Reede van Oudthoorn on his last visit.\n\nIn 1773, van Braam left China and the following year, he settled in a county-seat near Zutphen in the province of Gelderland. Inspired by the American Revolution, he decided to immigrate to the United States and settled in Charleston to work as a merchant and rice planter in 1783. He became a US citizen the following year. As a consequence of a family tragedy, van Braam decided to leave the US and take up a position as chief of the Dutch factory in Guangzhou. After a long journey, with stops in the Netherlands, Malacca and Batavia, he arrived in Guangzhou in 1790.\n\nHaving learned about the British Macartney Embassy to the Qing court in 1793, he requested that the commissioners-general in Batavia send a VOC embassy to the court of the Qianlong Emperor for the celebration of his sixtieth year on the throne. Batavia accepted the suggestion, but appointed the chief of the Dutch trading mission in Dejima, Isaac Titsingh (1745–1812) as head of the Dutch embassy instead of van Braam.\n\nIn November 1794, the embassy, which included van Braam and Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes (son of Joseph de Guignes) left Guangzhou and it arrived in Beijing in January 1795, just in time for Chinese new year.\nIn Beijing, the embassy was received together with representatives of other tributary countries and the members of the embassy performed the kowtow in front of the emperor according to Chinese custom. Unlike British diplomats, the members of the Dutch embassy did not refuse to perform the kowtow. Van Braam distinguished himself when his hat fell off while bowing, causing the emperor to laugh.\n\nVan Braam had retained his US citizenship and thus became the first American to meet a Chinese emperor.\nThe embassy was lavishly entertained for the remainder of their stay and they were allowed to have additional audiences with the Qianlong emperor at his palace outside Beijing.\n\nThe members of the Titsingh mission, including van Braam, were the last European diplomats to savour the mid-winter splendor of the vast Summer Palace (the \"Yuangmingyuan\", now known as the Old Summer Palace) before its destruction by the Lord Elgin's troops during the punitive Second Opium War in 1860.\n\nUpon the embassy's return to Guangzhou in March 1795, van Braam was unable to find a ship bound for the Netherlands and chose to board a ship to Philadelphia, where he arrived in 1796. Van Braam's arrival in the city attracted a lot of attention and he published an account of his journey, which he dedicated to George Washington. Van Braam decided to stay in the area and settled in Bristol outside the city. In 1798, he decided to leave the United States for unknown reasons, and after short stays in Germany and England, he bought a small property in Amsterdam, where he died in July 1801.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He held a special Samyak (सम्यक) ceremony in 1952 when the country was passing through a political crisis, and the Buddhist alms-giving festival became of crucial importance for both sides in the power struggle. \n\nBhakta Bir Singh was born to father Samyak Singh (also known as Samek Ratna) and mother Sānu Māyā Tuladhar in Kathmandu. The family home was located at Nhyokhā (न्ह्योखा), a neighborhood in the historical section of Kathmandu. He was married to Laxmi Hirā Kansakar, and was popularly known as Bhagat Sāhu.\n\nThe Tuladhars owned a business house in Lhasa, and following in the footsteps of his merchant ancestors, Bhakta Bir Singh went to Tibet to manage the family shop at a young age. He divided his time between Kathmandu, Lhasa and Kalimpong in India, a trade center and staging point for mule caravans to Tibet.\n\nBhakta Bir Singh's father Samyak Singh had made a pledge in 1950 to sponsor a special Samyak next year, and issued invitations to the ceremony, but he died while the preparations were being made. His sons went ahead with the arrangements to hold it as scheduled. However, the Nepalese revolution broke out, and their plans got caught in the middle. Since Samyak requires the presence of the head of state, Bhakta Bir Singh and his brothers were put in a difficult position regarding whom to invite. \n\nIn November 1950, King Tribhuvan went into exile in New Delhi, India in an attempt to bring down the Rana regime which held real power in the country. The Ranas then made his grandson Gyanendra the king. They pressed Bhakta Bir Singh to hold Samyak with Gyanendra presiding over it in order to grant him cultural endorsement. The freedom fighters, meanwhile, threatened him not to do so. Bhakta Bir Singh found a way out of the dilemma by citing his father's recent death and deferring the event. \n\nThe Ranas were overthrown in February 1951, and Tribhuvan returned to Nepal. A year later, the postponed Samyak was held on 15 January 1952 with Tribhuvan presiding over it. A stone mandala was installed at the venue at Bhuikhel to commemorate the event. The religious celebration was seen as an affirmation of the king's triumph in the power struggle against the hereditary prime ministers the Ranas.\n\nSamyak commemorates the practice of giving to the Buddhas and monks in the Newar Buddhist tradition. It is spread over three days, and is held at Kathmandu Durbar Square and the field at the foot of Swayambhu hill. During the ceremony, hundreds of images of Dīpankara Buddha are assembled, and gifts of different types of food are made to the deities and the Buddhist community.\n\n"}

Directly south of the historic CBD, Brickell is Miami and South Florida's major financial district.\n\nBrickell was settled in the modern era in the mid-19th century by early pioneers, growing to become Miami's \"Millionaire's Row\" in the early 20th century after the construction of lavish mansions along Brickell Avenue by Mary Brickell. By the 1970s, office towers, hotels and apartments began replacing the historic mansions. Today, Brickell has grown to overtake the city's historic central business district to the north, as one of the largest financial districts in the United States. With a fast-growing residential population, Brickell is one of Miami's fastest-growing as well as its most dense neighborhood, with a 2010 population of about 31,000.\n\nThe neighborhood of Brickell has its own newspaper, \"The Brickell Tribune\", \"which is published bi-weekly and is part of Miami Community Newspapers.\"\n\nBrickell is a dense, high-rise residential neighborhood with many upscale, luxury condominium and apartment towers. Brickell Avenue, Brickell's main north-south avenue and along Miami Avenue, home to many popular Miami restaurants, shops and places of entertainment. A few hundred feet east of the northeastern side of Brickell is Brickell Key, a gated island of upscale, high-rise residential and hotel towers. , over 190,000 office employees work in greater Downtown. Today, greater Downtown Miami is one of the fastest-growing neighborhoods in Miami, booming from 40,000 residents in 2000 to 80,000 in 2010. Brickell is served by the Miami Metrorail at the Brickell station and by 5 stations of the Metromover's Brickell Loop.\n\nAs South Florida's financial district, Brickell is the core of Miami's banking, investment, and financial sectors. Additionally, along with Downtown Miami, Brickell has most of the state's foreign consulates, including the consulates of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, France, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom amongst others.\n\nBrickell lies south of the Miami River, extending south to SW 26th Road (the Rickenbacker Causeway), and is mostly mixed financial and residential north of Broadway (SW 15th Road), and mostly residential south of Broadway. Brickell is home to 31,759 year-round residents. The area of Brickell south of Broadway is mainly low and mid-rise residential buildings west of Brickell Avenue and high-rise residential to the east of Brickell Avenue. This area of Brickell includes the \"Millionaires' Row\" section of Brickell Avenue, home to many expensive residences, and home to many of Miami's most expensive apartments and condominiums, as well as some iconic Miami skyscrapers, such as the Atlantis Condominium.\n\nAlthough Brickell has traditionally been known as a financial district, in recent years, construction of numerous condominium and apartment towers in Brickell, has extended the upscale residential neighborhood feel of lower Brickell into upper Brickell. Recent construction in Brickell has also enlarged the urban core of Brickell from Brickell Avenue west to the Metrorail line, with new office and residential towers, such as Axis at Brickell Village. As of 2010, 80,000 residents live in Brickell, among them, famous celebrities such as José José, Luis Miguel, Clinton Portis, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony.\n\nAt the center of Brickell is Mary Brickell Village, with an assortment of restaurants, boutiques, services that create a gathering area for high-class retail and restaurants. Some the best and most well-known names are leasing space in the project. The project is designed after a French-style village and attracts social gathering and entertainment.\n\nTo the north of Brickell is Downtown, with most of the area's public elementary schools and Miami Dade College's Wolfson Campus. Downtown is also home to the Miami Main Library, as well as various parks, theatres, museums, and sporting venues. South of Brickell is Coconut Grove, with Mercy Hospital, CocoWalk, Dinner Key, Villa Vizcaya, as well as many historic sites and parks. Coconut Grove also has many of Miami's best private schools, such as Ransom Everglades, Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart, and Immaculata-Lasalle High School.\n\nWest of Brickell is Little Havana, extending from SW 8th St westward. East of Brickell is Biscayne Bay, and eastward along the Rickenbacker Causeway, is Virginia Key and Key Biscayne. Both keys have many public beaches, nature preserves, parks, and various other cultural venues. Also east, along the MacArthur Causeway is South Beach.\n\nHistorically, all of Brickell was a wealthy suburb. As the downtown area expanded, the northeastern part of Brickell adopted high-density zoning that allowed high rise construction centered around Brickell Avenue, while south of 15th Street zoning remains highly limited with the exception of the very coastline east of Brickell Avenue. West of the Metrorail line, \"west Brickell\" melded with Little Havana until sweeping gentrification took place in the 2010s. The subdivisions of Brickell are recognized by the Downtown Development Authority.\n\nWest Brickell is a sub-neighborhood of Brickell, west of the Metrorail line (SW 1st Avenue), and east of I-95, south of the Miami River, and north of SE 15th Road (Broadway). It is primarily a residential neighborhood, made up mostly of low to mid-rise apartment buildings. In the 2010s Miami condominium boom that began in 2012, interest in Brickell spilled over into West Brickell, with mid-century and prewar buildings being replaced by larger buildings. However, they included affordable housing and were generally non-luxury.\n\nSouth Brickell is a sub-neighborhood of Brickell, south of SE 15th Road (Broadway) to the Rickenbacker Causeway, east of I-95, west of Biscayne Bay. It is primarily a residential neighborhood with single-family homes from the early-1900s along South Miami Avenue and high-rise residential towers along the east side of Brickell Avenue.\n\nBrickell was often referred to as the \"Brickell Financial District\", or just \"Financial District\", during the time of large-scale commercial office development, including major banks building headquarters there. The \"financial district\" area is what today comprises the core of Brickell, which has become overtaken by high rise residential buildings, and is hence referred to as simply \"Brickell\".\n\nAs of 2010, the population of Brickell had 27,776 people, with a population density of 37,622 per square mile, making it one of the densest neighborhoods in the United States. In the 2010 US Census, the racial makeup of Brickell was 62.0% Hispanic of any race, 33.2% White (non-Hispanic), 1.6% Asian, and 1.4% Black. The zip codes for Brickell include 33129, 33130, and 33131. The area covers . Many of its daily occupants work in banking, law, and finance.\n\nAs of 2000, there were 5,557 males and 5,972 females. The median age for males was 38.4 years old, while the median age for females was 40.6 years old. The average household size had 1.8 people, while the average family size had 2.6 members. The percentage of married-couple families (among all households) was 30.3%, while the percentage of married-couple families with children (among all households) was 8.5%, and the percentage of single-mother households (among all households) was 4.3%. The percentage of never-married males 15 years old and over was 20.2%, while the percentage of never-married females 15 years old and over was 16.0%.\n\nAs of 2000, the percentage of people who speak English not well or not at all made up 27.7% of the population. The percentage of residents born in Florida was 17.1%, the percentage of people born in another U.S. state was 13.7%, and the percentage of native residents but born outside the U.S. was 3.9%, while the percentage of foreign-born residents was 65.3%.\n\nBrickell is a highly educated and affluent neighborhood. As of 2014, an estimated 75% of residents older than 25 hold at least a bachelors level degree with 34% holding an advanced degree. The approximate average household income of $125,500 is more than twice the average for the City of Miami.\n\nMiami-Dade County Public Schools operates area public schools:\n\nPrivate schools:\n\n\n\n\nBrickell is served by Metrobus throughout the area, the Miami Metrorail, and the Metromover:\n\nMetrorail:\n\nMetromover:\nPublic Transportation in the Downtown/Brickell area is used more than in any other part of Miami and is a vital part of Brickell life. Metrorail, Miami's heavy rail system, has one station in Brickell at the Brickell Station. In addition to Metrorail, the Metromover train system runs 3 lines throughout Downtown (the Downtown Loop, the Omni Loop, and the Brickell Loop). The Metromover connects with Metrorail and is free. Metromover stations can be found at roughly every two blocks in Brickell.\n\nMetrorail has stops throughout Miami with connections to Miami International Airport, all Miami-Dade County bus lines, Tri-Rail and Amtrak. The main bus station in Downtown is located next to the Arsht Center at the Adrienne Arsht Center Station.\n\nAs an urban and pedestrian-friendly area with an extensive public transit network, Brickell (along with Downtown, Omni, and South Beach) is one of the areas in Miami where a car-free lifestyle is commonplace. Many Brickellites get around by foot, bicycle, Metromover or by taxi. The Metromover is a popular alternative to walking in the area, especially on rainy, hot or cold days, as the Metromover is free, and stations are located roughly every two blocks throughout the area.\n\nRecently, the City of Miami, along with the Downtown Development Authority, has begun bicycle initiatives promoting citywide bike parking and bike lanes, that have made bicycling much more popular for residents. Bike lanes and bike sharrows are currently planned for the majority of Downtown streets to be painted by the end of 2010. Decobike, the popular bike sharing program in Miami Beach, has announced a launch in Brickell/Downtown Miami in Mid 2014. The Venetian Causeway is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects South Beach to Downtown. The Rickenbacker Causeway is very popular on weekends for recreational bicyclists, and often, bicycles can outnumber cars on the causeway.\n\nTaxis are popular in Brickell, especially from Brickell to South Beach, Design District or to Coconut Grove. Since many Brickell residents choose to not have cars, taxis are also popular for rides within Downtown neighborhoods, especially after midnight when the Metromover stops running. Taxis can be hailed on the street, or phoned.\n\n\n\n\nWith rapid urbanization over the decades, very little remains of the original character of Brickell. Brickell was originally platted for mansions and large homes by Mary Brickell, which thus led to the name \"Millionaire's Row.\" With the growth of the city, especially in the 1970s onwards, Brickell's character began to change with the construction of high-rise office towers along Brickell Avenue, and high-rise residential towers in lower Brickell, south of SE 15th Road (Broadway). A commercial boom in the 1980s, brought mass construction of office towers to Brickell, and subsequent construction, would further change the neighborhood into the dense, urban, residential and commercial neighborhood it is today. Some of the historic buildings remaining in Brickell can be seen in the photos below. While not a registered historic landmark, Brickell is home to Tobacco Road, which claimed to be Miami's oldest bar, in business since 1912, with a now-demolished building built in 1915.\n\n\n"}

He pioneered the cultivation of Roselle for the production of Roselle fibre rope and twine, his initial effort including the Sweet Kamiri Estate in Sungei Siput. He was a member of the Perak Advisory Board and the last \"Kapitan China\" of Perak and Malaya. At the time of his death he was said to have been the wealthiest man in Penang. There was a big turnout at his funeral in Penang (7 April 1935) including many prominent personalities from the Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements and the funeral procession was a quarter of a mile long.\n\nKapitan Chung Keng Quee, Mandarin 2nd Class of the Imperial Chinese Court and leader of the Hai San secret society in British Malaya had nine male issue, the 4th and best known of whom was Chung, Thye-phin. Chung Thye Phin's Ch'i Yeh or godfather was Chin Seng Yam (Chin Ah Yam), the leader of the Ghee Hin, once the enemy of his father who was leader of the opposing Hai San, both factions (Ghee Hin and Hai San) fighting for domination of the tin fields of Larut.\n\nKapitan Chung Thye Phin was born 28 Sep 1879 in Kota, Taiping, Perak, Malaya. He received his education at the St. Xavier's, Penang. Upon leaving school, he was initiated into his father's business. Born in the Federated Malay States, in 1902 he was granted a certificate of naturalisation by the Straits Government, making him a British citizen.\n\nAn enterprising youth with a flair for progress, he later started a number of tin mines of his own, including a deep-shaft mine at Tronoh or Teronoh, adjoining the famous mine of the same name, and the hydraulic mine at Batu Tugoh. Tronoh was the centre of the mining field containing the mine of Chung Thye Phin's Tronoh Mines Company Ltd.\n\nHis open-cast mines were operated on the most modern system in his time. He had the distinction of being the first Chinese miner to have introduced the latest appliances on the mines, under the supervision of a European engineer.\n\nIn 1914 he was elected to the council of the F.M.S. Chamber of Mines.\n\nTogether with Ho Man and Foo Choong Nyit, Chung Thye Phin co-founded the Toh Allang Chinese Tin Company in Perak, the first Chinese limited liability company, in 1925. He was also a founder and member of the Board of Directors of the Eastern Smelting Company (1908), Ltd along with Eu Tong Sen, Ng Boo Bee, Ong Hung Chong, Khaw Joo Tok and his nephew Khaw Bian Kee. The Eastern Smelting Company, Penang was registered in August 1907, and in November that year, its prospectus was advertised in various newspapers offering shares to the public. Governor Sir John Andserson officiated at its opening in January 1908. The company appeared to be doing well and at its first ordinary general meeting in October that year a 5 per cent dividend was declared based on the good performance of the prior six months work. Problems arose the following year and by the end of it its works manager had resigned, accusing the managing director and other directors of financial mismanagement. By March 1911 it had been decided to sell off the business to a London company. Newspapers in July 1911 carried the prospectus of the new London-based company that was to acquire the business of the Malayan company. The chairmanship of the London-based public company was Chung Thye Phin's old friend, former British Resident, Sir Ernest Birch. By the end of November 1911 the transfer from old to new company had been completed and the first general meeting of the new London-based company took place. Ownership by the London-company of the Penang-company became complete with the liquidation of the Penang public company.\n\nIn 1907 he convened a public meeting held at his offices attended by leading miners and other prominent residents to discuss problems that could arise as a result of the construction of the proposed Tronoh Railway and calling for a memorandum to be sent to the government to postpone the letting of contracts until a full public enquiry could be taken.\n\nHe was also active in promoting tin mining and the latest tin mining technologies available at the time.\n\nHe also had vast interests in some of the Government revenue farm monopolies. On 2, July 1903, the public tenders were declared open for the running of the Kedah and Penang Opium Farms. There were eight tenders. The highest tender was made by Chung Thye Phin for the Penang farm at $260,000 a month.\n\nAn understanding was reached that: (i) the government cut the Penang opium farm from the $260,000 a month tendered by Chung Thye Phin to $220,000 (later reduced to $217,000), and agreed that the syndicate could have both the Penang and Kedah farms at an overall price of $260,000 per month; (ii) Gan Ngoh Bee could have half the farm, but the other half should go to Chung Thye Phin, whose tender was the highest; and (iii) the government would undertake to secure the Kedah farm on behalf of the Penang syndicate at $40,000 a month with one-to-three months' deposits.\n\nChung Thye Phin was a committee member of the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce (檳城華人商部局) which was founded in June 1903 and before that served as a President of the Penang Chinese Town Hall (平章公館) established in 1881. At one time he even led the Penang Chinese Literary Association.\n\nHe was a director of the Straits Echo.\n\nDespite his many business concerns, Chung Thye Phin evinced a lively interest in various philanthropic works, foreign famine funds and local charities.\n\nIn 1904 he subscribed (1,000) to the building fund for the founding of the Seven States Medical School. At a Chinese concert at Ipoh in 1908 in aid of the Canton famine fund he paid $100 for a plate of icecream.\n\nAccording to a deed dating back to 1906, he was one of the trustees of the Penang Chinese Recreation Club. \n\nDuring the financial depression in Perak in 1908 he was one of the four members of a deputation (the other three being Eu Tong Sen, Foo Choo Choon and Yau Tet Shin) appointed by the whole of the Chinese community in Perak to plead their plight and bring to the attention of the acting resident of Perak, Mr E L Brockman their requests for government aid.\n\nHe donated a fountain to the Penang Turf Club and the Taiping Lake Gardens to the Perak State Government. Both of these still exist today. Together with Eu Tong Sen he donated land in Papan for a jail. This same pair contributed $1,500 to the Perak Chinese Recreation Club in 1913.\n\nThis worthy scion of Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee was the recipient of a tasseled \"gold medal\" from the Government of Indo China (Annam) for his liberal gifts to the Relief Fund. (Vide \"The Chung Family Record\", op. cit., pp. 9–12)\n\nHe appears in the . He was just 25 years of age at that time.\n\nHe was a member of the board of governors of the Yuk Choy school in Ipoh which began Standard 5 and 6 classes in 1908.\n\nHe was made a Justice of the Peace in 1917.\n\nHe was appointed in March 1918, by Sir Arthur Henderson Young to be a member of the Federal Council of the Federated Malay States during the temporary absence of the Honourable Mr. Eu Tong Sen.\n\nHe also served as a member of the Commission to enquire into and report on the Mining Industry, for which all the members were thanked by Mr. E. L. Brockman, Chief Secretary, F. M. S., for \"the thoroughness with which you have gone into the various and important points raised and the clearness with which the conclusion arrived at regarding them have been recorded\". (K. L., F. M. S. Correspondence Ref: No. 508-1919 dated 29 January 1920)\n\nIn October 1920 he was appointed President of the Chinese Widow's and Orphan's Institution, Perak at its seventeenth annual general meeting in Ipoh.\n\nEarlier that year he was part of a deputation, also comprising the Hon. Mr A N Kenion, the Hon. Mr J H Rich, Messrs. F S Physick, Herbert Cooper, C F Green, Chairman, Sanitary Board, Kinta and Cheang Heng Thoy, J. P., who met with the Hon. Mr W George Maxwell, C.M.G. British Resident of Perak to discuss Ipoh's electricity and lighting needs.\n\nHe was elected representative vice president of the Garden Club for Penang, a position he was re-elected to for a number of years.\n\nOn 24 March 1921, His Highness Iskandar Shah K. C. M. G., the Sultan of Perak, with the advice of Colonel W. J. P. Hume, British Resident, Perak, conferred on him the title of \"Kapitan China\", in all probability, the last of the Chinese Kapitans in Malaya. He was installed by the Sultan of Perak in Kuala Kangsar amidst much traditional pomp and pagentry. His appointment was so popular with the community that he was escorted to Kuala Kangsar by the delegates of more than 70 Chinese organisations from Perak.\n\nLater that year he was invited to Kuala Lumpur to give his views to the Trade Depression Commission during its two day's sitting in camera.\n\nHe was appointed trustee of the resuscitated Perak Miners' and Planters' association in 1922.\n\nIn July 1923 he was elected the first president of the newly inaugurated British Chinese Association. In November 1923, at the annual general meeting of the Perak Chinese Dramatic Club, he was elected Patron.\n\nHe presided over the Association of States and Straits Representatives (representing Chinese born in the Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements) in 1923.\n\nIn 1926, together with Leong Sin Nam he was elected an honorary member of the Ipoh Club, whose members till then were restricted to the European community. The Times of Malaya said this was a compliment which should further cement the good feeling existing between the European and Chinese communities in Kinta.\n\nIn the name of His Majesty the King, His Excellency the High Commissioner awarded him a Certificate of Honour in recognition of his loyal and valuable services to the government of the F. M. S. in June 2007. He was presented the Malayan Certificate of Honour and its accompanying insignia by the Chief Secretary, F. M. S., Sir William Peel, in the throne room at Istana Nagara, Kuala Kangsar in August 1928, having received the same award on the occasion of H. M. the King-Emperor's birthday the year before.\n\nAccording to berita.perak.gov.my, Foo Yet Kai, another Perak philanthropist, bought Chung Thye Phin's villa in Ipoh from the family of the late Kapitan and later gave permission for it to be converted into a private hospital, then known as Our Lady's Hospital and run by the Franciscan Sisters from Salzkotten, Germany. The hospital subsequently was renamed Kinta Medical Centre in the 1980s when the Foo Yet Kai Foundation took over the administration.\n\nIn 1905 together with a few others, he maintained 'Seng Kee' a Mess patronized by wealthy miners and merchants including Foo Choo Choon with whom he had familial and business relations.\n\nIt is known that he owned expensive cars, prize-winning horses, and even issued his own currency for use in his mines.\n\nMotoring was one of his passions.\n\nChung Thye Phin was an enthusiastic sportsman and on more than one occasion won the Blue Ribbon of the Straits Turf apart from many lesser events. Among his racing trophies are one for the 1905 Singapore Derby won by one of his horses, Devilment. He was also a good billiards player.\n\nHe was also said to be a first class billiard player and played an exhibition match with world billiard champion John Roberts at the E&O Hotel in the early 1900s.\n\nAt one time, during the latter part of the first World War, he was among the few who were permitted by the Government to print and issue 10-cent notes for circulation. Chung Thye Phin first issued private banknotes in 10 cent denominations on 11 February 1918. These notes were only circulated within his mining concessions and the Kapitan's trading outlets at Phin Kee Chan in Ipoh and were used by large numbers of labourers in the mining areas in exchange for goods (Source: Museum Numismatik Maybank). No other denominations have been discovered. Circa 1918 the notes bear the legends Ten Cents \"Phin Kee Chan Ten Cents\" at top and bottom border and \"Phin Kee Chan\" at left and right border. The legend Chung Thye Phin was printed in a black panel diagonally. On the top left corner is a value of \"10cents\" and written in Chinese on the right is \"bearer of this bill may exchange 10c from Phin Kee Chan\". Embossed on it was an oval seal bearing the legend of Chung Thye Phin.\n\nIn 1897, during a trip to China, he found himself and his entourage held up by pirates. What's perhaps even more surprising is that more than a few United States newspapers carried the following story about this son of Malaya:\n\n\"Tacoma, Wash., August 30. -- The steamer Columbia, from Yokohama, brings Oriental advices up to July 27. News has just reached Hong Kong of the prevalence of pirates on the Canton River and one of the most daring outrages perpetrated. One of the sons of Capt. Chung Kewi, a Straits millionaire, Chung Ah Phin, was the victim. With a few of his relatives he hired a boat and they were proceeding to their native place. On the second day the boat stuck in the mud and could not proceed. During the night a gang of men with painted faces and fully armed boarded the boat. With revolvers leveled at the passengers they commanded silence, while four men began at once to look for plunder. Ah Phin brought from the Straits jewelry amounting in value to $50,000 and $20,000 in cash. These the pirates took, besides clothing, etc. They left, after threatening the victims with instant death if they made a noise till twelve hours afterwards. In the morning information was sent down to Canton, but before the authorities had time to get a gunboat up the river the pirates had made their escape.\"\n\nChung Thye Phin Building, 14 Station Road in Ipoh, Perak is a three-storey corner building from 1907. It originally housed the Medical Hall established by Dr. R.M. Connolly, the Oilfileds Dispensaries Ltd. and more recently the George Town Dispensary. Mr W. Cecil Payne, managing director of the Times of Malaya and a member of the Institute of Incorporated Accountants, had offices in Chung Thye Phin's buildings.\n\nApart from Phin Kee Chan (referred to by many other names, among them the Chung Thye Phin Building), he is also associated with his father's townhouse cum office in Penang, Hye Kee Chan, and with some other structures, like his country house on Dummond Hill in Taiping, Perak.\n\nHis villa in the heart of Ipoh, was bought by Foo Yet Kai who later allowed its conversion, free of rent, to a private hospital, then known as Our Lady’s Hospital. It was administered by the Sisters of the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood from April 1964 to Jan 1983 but has now been taken over by The Kinta Medical Centre.\n\nThe Chung Thye Phin Mansion at Gurney Drive on Penang island (the address at the time was No 2 Kelawai Road) with its subterranean passageways and chambers was, after his death, sold and turned into a hotel (The Shanghai Hotel) in the late 1930s but was later demolished in 1964 and on its footprint now stands an imposing condominium (1 Gurney Drive). Author Queeny Chang gives an extensive description of the place and her experience of it in her autobiography. At one time it served to house a club for German U-boatmen.\n\nHe designed Relau Villa (also on Penang island), his holiday resort with a swimming pool ringed by private and other types of rooms. Its derelict structure can still be seen and explored at Taman Metropolitan, Relau in Penang, today. According to family history Kapitan Chung Thye Phin was inspired by the artistic canals of Venice and the enchanting ponds and lakes of China when he designed the swimming-pool, which was constructed by Mr. B. H. Ung (Ung Ban Hoe was attached to the architectural firm of Stark & McNeil), the first Chinese architect who introduced reinforced concrete buildings to the community, notably the Ban Hin Lee Bank.\n\nA commentary by his grand daughter, Oola goes, \"Chung Thye Phin had many residences, some of them mansions, in Penang, Ipoh and Taiping. His residence in what is now Persiaran Gurney was the most famous, with its grand entertaining rooms and undersea wing. It was built before there was a Persiaran Gurney or a Gurney Drive, and was therefore right on the shore. His largest residence in Ipoh was in a street that carried his name (and still does). This mansion now serves as a hospital. He built a summer house on a large estate near Relau and surrounded it with gardens, orchards and fish ponds. However its most striking feature was the fact that it was built around a swimming pool (the first in Penang) in the Roman tradition. This house still exists in its ruined state, now surrounded by high rise 21st century flats. There are indeed many stories to be told about Chung Thye Phin.\"\n\nHe also had property on Penang Hill, as was the way with the rich in those days. His was a bungalow named, simply, \"Highlands\".\n\nSeveral articles have been published, mentioning these properties and erroneously attributing them to Thye Phin's father, Chung Keng Quee who died in 1901, well before any of these were built.\n\nA widely travelled Malayan, Kapitan Chung Thye Phin had gone round the world on many a business-cum-pleasure trip. On one occasion, he undertook a perilous trip up the scenic gorges of the Yangtze River at Chungking, China, thus earning for himself the distinction of being the first non-China-born Chinese to have made the venture. It was here that he was enraptured by Nature's inimitable splendour.\n\nIn Perak he was honoured with roads named after him. Jalan Chung Thye Phin in Ipoh borders the Kinta Medical Centre. This location is appropriate - the Centre, a private hospital under the administration of the Foo Yet Kai foundation, was formerly the family mansion of Chung Thye Phin. There is another road of the same name also named in his honour in his birthplace of Taiping.\n\nChung Thye Phin rubbed shoulders with the rich and powerful including Sultan Iskandar Shah of Perak, a polo lover. A photograph in the National Archives shows him sitting next to the Sultan.\n\nHe was among the group of Chinese towkays who presented the address to King George V when he visited Singapore in 1901 as Duke of Cornwall.\n\nIn February 1907 When the Duke and the Duchess of Connaught and Princess Patricia paid an official visit to Penang in Feb. 1907, they were driven by Kapitan Chung Thye Phin in his own private car.\n\nIn 1921 he feted Sir Ernest Woodford Birch at his Ipoh residence having invited all the old residents of Perak, European and Chinese.\n\nEu Tong Sen and Chung Thye Phin were \"blood\" brothers. They went through Chinese ceremony to become \"Keet Bye Heng Tai\". When Chung Thye Phin travelled to Hong Kong, he stayed in Eu Tong Sen's villa there and they kept an account of his expenses in the company's account books. Eu Tong Sen's villa in HK was called \"Eucliff\". It has been torn down. It was built at Repulse Bay, HK, overlooking the sea. The property was huge. It was built with stone like a castle. It included within its walled area a tennis court and also a swimming pool.\n\nEu Tong Sen and Chung Thye Phin had common interests – motorcars, racehorses, country houses, etc. 1903 when the Ipoh Gymkhana Club was founded, both of them decided to enter their thoroughbreds regularly in the Ipoh races. They jointly built a weekend retreat, \"Forest Lodge\", at Gopeng Road with a large stable. In April 1912 Eu Tong Sen was appointed the permanent Chinese Member of the Federal Council, the seat having fallen vacant on the demise of Leong Fee. Chung Thye Phin sold his half-share to Eu Tong Sen who desired grander accommodations following the latter's elevation in status. Chung Thye Phin in turn bought Drummond’s Hill in Taiping, a estate and the former Residency of Sir Hugh Low. In 1908, together with Chung Thye Phin he built a large Chinese theatre in the important mining town of Kampar near Ipoh.\n\nChung, Thye Phin's Penang firms served as the agent for Eu, Tong Sen in Penang before he (Eu) opened a branch on the island. Eu Tong Sen's Penang branch, at least according to business directories, was the latest in his branch office network. It seemed to have opened only in 1920.\n\nHe studied at St. Xavier's Institution on Penang Island. He was a patron of the Khek Community Guild (Singapore). He was appointed trustee of the Penang Tseng-Lung Hui-kuan in 1916 and tasked with overhauling the association, removing irresponsible elements from the association and repairing its premises. He also played an important role in the administration of the country, and was both a State Councillor and a Federal Councillor. He was a member of the Perak State Advisory Board and the last Kapitan China of Perak and Malaya. In 1900 he replaced his father as member of the Perak State Council, a position held by Chung Keng Quee since the council was first formed in 1877 and remained on the council till his resignation in 1927. On 24 March 1921, His Highness Iskandar Shah K. C. M. G., the Sultan of Perak, conferred on him the title of \"Kapitan China\". His installation ceremony was held on 28 March in the royal town of Kuala Kangsar and included a procession that went around the town, accompanied by firecrackers.\n\nHe was the son of Kapitan Chung Keng Quee (also spelt as Chung Ah Kwee) an immigrant from China. He had 7 wives but was survived by 6 of them who gave him 10 sons and 7 daughters. Chung Thye Phin was born in 1879 in Taiping, lived most of his life in Penang and died in 1935.\n\nSons:\nChung, Kok Soon (KS, deceased 2006)\nChung, Kok Ching (KC, deceased 1994)\nChung, Kok Choon (Peter, deceased 1996)\nChung, Kok Heng (Frankie deceased)\nChung, Kok Khen (Khen, deceased 2006)\nChung, Kok En (Dennis, deceased 2014)\nChung, Kok Tong (Henry, deceased 2001)\nChung, Kok Leong (Leon, deceased 2014)\nChung, Kok Choy (Kenny, deceased 2005)\nChung, Kok Chuan (George, deceased 2009)\n\nDaughters:\nChung, Yuet See (Mary, deceased 1995) \nChung, Yuet Kuen (Louise, deceased) \nChung, Guat Hooi \nChung, Guat Hong\nChung, Guat Kheng\nChung, Yuet Wah\nChung, Yuet Fong\n\nMr. Chung Thye Phin, M.C.

Rather than setting out binding laws, government regulators (in the UK, the Financial Reporting Council, in Germany, under the Aktiengesetz) set out a code, which listed companies may either comply with, or if they do not comply, explain publicly why they do not. The UK Corporate Governance Code, the German Corporate Governance Code (or Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 'Code Tabaksblat' () use this approach in setting minimum standards for companies in their audit committees, remuneration committees and recommendations for how good companies should divide authority on their boards.\n\nThe purpose of \"comply or explain\" is to \"let the market decide\" whether a set of standards is appropriate for individual companies. Since a company may deviate from the standard, this approach rejects the view that \"one size fits all\", but because of the requirement of disclosure of explanations to market investors, anticipates that if investors do not accept a company's explanations, then investors will sell their shares, hence creating a \"market sanction\", rather than a legal one. The concept was first introduced after the recommendations of the Cadbury Report of 1992.\n\n"}

The term \"degenerate dimension\" was originated by Ralph Kimball.\n\nAs Bob Becker says:\n\nAlthough most writers and practitioners use the term degenerate dimension correctly, it is very easy to find misleading definitions in online and printed sources. For example, the Oracle FAQ defines a degenerate dimension as a \"data dimension that is stored in the fact table rather than a separate dimension table. This eliminates the need to join to a dimension table. You can use the data in the degenerate dimension to limit or 'slice and dice' your fact table measures.\"\n\nThis common interpretation implies that it is good dimensional modeling practice to place dimension attributes in the fact table, as long as you call them a degenerate dimension. This is not the case; the concept of degenerate dimension was developed by Kimball to support a specific, well-defined exception to the otherwise ironclad rule that dimension attributes are always pulled out into dimension tables.\n\n\n"}

Originally established as a joint venture between the Dow Chemical Company and Corning Incorporated, it is now owned by DowDuPont and specializes in silicone and silicon-based technology, and is the largest silicone product producer in the world.\n\nDow Corning was formally established in 1943 as a joint venture between the American conglomerates Dow Chemical and Corning Glass to explore the potential of silicone and was a manufacturer of products for use by the U.S. military in World War II. The company began operating its first plant, in Midland, MI, in 1945. Dr. E. C. Sullivan was named president, and Dr. William R. Collings was named general manager in 1943. Dr. Collings later became president from 1954 until 1962. It expanded into Canada and Europe in 1948, and into South America and Japan in 1961.\n\nA large, majority-owned subsidiary of Dow Corning Corporation is the Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation. It is one of the world's largest producers of high-purity polycrystalline silicon, which is sold in varying purity grades for use in both semiconductor silicon wafer manufacture and photovoltaics applications as solar cells.\n\nIn 2002, the company created the Xiameter brand as an online-only distributor. As of 2011, Xiameter offers 2,100 of Dow Corning’s 7,000 products.\n\nOn November 13, 2014, Dow Chemical's CEO Andrew N. Liveris revealed in a presentation to investors that Corning Incorporated intended to exit the joint venture of 71 years, citing other priorities. Following the December 11, 2015 announcement that it would merge with DuPont, Dow also announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Corning's stake in Dow Corning in exchange for $4.8 billion in cash and Corning gaining a roughly 40% stake in Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation. Dow Chemical assumed full ownership of Dow Corning on June 1, 2016.\n\nDow Corning markets over 7000 products include various sealants, adhesives, rubbers, lubricants, silicon oils and solvents. Around 2,100 of these are available through the Dow Corning online-only distributor Xiameter, including fluids, gels, resins. The range of industries targeted by Dow Corning products spans from electronics and automotive to construction, healthcare and others. In recent years, the company has expanded production of solar cells, particularly through its majority stake in Hemlock, which accounts for a polysilicon franchise worth over $1 billion. In 2011, then-CTO Gregg Zank explained that the company tries to focus its product development on societal “megatrends” (e.g. energy scarcity and urbanization).\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, class-action lawsuits claimed that Dow Corning's silicone breast implants caused systemic health problems. The claims first centered on breast cancer and then migrated to a range of autoimmune diseases, including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and various neurological problems. This led to numerous lawsuits beginning in 1984 and culminating in a 1998 multibillion-dollar class action settlement. As a result, Dow Corning was in bankruptcy protection for nine years, ending in June 2004 during which time it largely withdrew from clinical markets.\n\nAlthough a number of independent reviews, including the Institute of Medicine in the United States, subsequently indicated that silicone breast implants do not cause breast cancers or any identifiable systemic diseases, on 21 March 2017, the FDA issued a statement indicating that women with breast implants have a \"very low but increased risk\" of getting a rare form of cancer called anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). The cancer is associated with nine deaths, the FDA said. These findings have caused an uptick in breast implant removal surgeries.\n\n"}
{"id": "17892593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17892593", "title": "Edsel and Eleanor Ford House", "text": "Edsel and Eleanor Ford House\n\nThe Edsel and Eleanor Ford House is a mansion located at 1100 Lake Shore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, northeast of Detroit, Michigan; it stands on the site known as \"Gaukler Point\", on the shore of Lake St. Clair. The house became the new residence of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford family in 1929. Edsel Ford was the son of Henry Ford and an executive at Ford Motor Company. The estate's buildings were designed by architect Albert Kahn, its site plan and gardens by renowned landscape designer Jens Jensen. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016.\n\nThe Fords traveled to England with Albert Kahn for the concept's ideas, where they were attracted to the vernacular architecture of the Cotswolds. They asked Kahn to design a house that would resemble the closely assembled village cottages typical of that rural region. Kahn's design included sandstone exterior walls, a traditional slate roof with the stone shingles decreasing in size as they reach its peak, and moss with ivy grown across the house's exterior. Construction on the house began in 1926.\n\nWhile construction of the house itself took only one year, two years were spent fitting it with antique wood paneling and fireplaces brought from English Manor houses; interior fittings were in the hands of Charles Roberson, an expert in adapting old European paneling and fittings to American interiors. The Gallery, the largest room in the house, is paneled with sixteenth-century oak linenfold relief carved wood panelling. Its hooded chimneypiece is from Wollaston Hall in Worcestershire, England; the timber-framed house had been demolished in 1925 and its dismantled elements and fittings were in the process of being dispersed. Fourteenth century stained-glass window medallions were added to the house in the late 1930s. Roberson's barrel-vaulted ceiling for the Gallery was modeled on one at Boughton Malherbe, Kent, England. Paneling and doors in the Dining Room, entirely devoid of electricity, came from 'New Place', a victim of early twentieth-century expansion in Upminster, a new suburb of London. The Library's paneling and its stone chimneypiece came from the Brudenell seat, Deene Park, Northamptonshire, England. Harris suggests that this already once removed paneling had come from another 'Brudenell seat.'\nThe Study has a wooden overmantel with the date 1585, from Heronden Hall, in Tenterden, Kent.\n\nOther interesting design elements include kitchen counters made of sterling silver, a \"secret\" photographic darkroom behind a panel of Edsel Ford's office, and Art Deco style rooms designed by Walter Dorwin Teague, a leading industrial designer of the 1930s. Teague's first floor \"Modern Room\" features 'the new' indirect lighting method, taupe colored leather wall panels, and a curved niche with eighteen vertical mirrored sections. He also designed bedrooms and sitting rooms for all three of Edsel and Eleanor's sons. Teague's design for son Henry Ford II’s bathroom includes grey glass walls made of the same structural glass as its shower stall.\n\nThe house featured an extensive art collection, reflecting Edsel and Eleanor's status as serious museum benefactors. After Eleanor Ford's death, many important paintings were donated to the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA). Reproductions were hung in their place. The classical French-style Drawing Room features two original Paul Cézanne paintings and reproductions of Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Edgar Degas works. A reproduction of Vincent van Gogh's \"The Postman Roulin\" hangs in the Morning Room. An original Diego Rivera painting, \"Cactus on the Plains\", hangs in the Modern Room.\n\nThe estate's gardens were designed by landscape architect Jens Jensen with his traditional 'long view,' giving visitors a glimpse of the residence down the long meadow after the passing the entry gates, then brief partial views along the long drive, and only at the end revealing the entire house and another view back up the long meadow.\n\nMrs. Ford wanted to have a rose garden installed but Jensen originally disapproved of this claiming that it would ruin the landscape which was designed to look completely natural. Jensen had previously quit on Henry Ford and Clara Ford, when Clara wanted to install a rose garden directly in the center of the backyard meadow at the Henry Ford Estate. Eleanor and Jensen eventually came to a compromise and the rose garden was placed behind some native bushes which was out of sight of the meadow that is the focal piece of the front lawn. Jensen's son was contracted later on to install the new garden area which has a reflecting pool and does not have the natural stylizing of the rest of the grounds. Instead he opted for finely trimmed bushes and square grassy areas.\n\nThe grounds of the estate include a power house and a gate house along affluent Lake Shore Drive, often mistaken for the actual house. The gate house includes apartments formerly used by staff and an eight-car garage with a turntable to rotate cars so they don’t need to back out. The Recreation House beyond the man-made lagoon and swimming pool contains changing rooms and a squash court with spectator's gallery. Closer to the gate house is Josephine Ford's child-sized playhouse, built for her by her grandmother Clara (Mrs. Henry Ford), in 1930. It features working electricity and plumbing and an exterior decorated with characters from nursery rhymes.\n\nFor William on his 21st birthday the family enlisted a company which built a full size replica pirate ship on the lagoon as a party showpiece. The party was held outside just off the Apple Patio and featured live acts including Frank Sinatra.\n\nEdsel Ford died in this house in 1943 and his wife Eleanor Ford lived there until her death in 1976. It was her wish that the property be used for \"the benefit of the public\". The Edsel & Eleanor Ford House is open to the public for guided tours. Located on at 1100 Lake Shore Road in Grosse Pointe Shores, the house has a fine collection of original antiques and art, and beautiful lakefront grounds. The grounds include the frontage on Ford's Cove, the total Lake St. Clair waterfront of the property is 3,100 feet (985 m). The house currently hosts special events, classes and lectures. The estate is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nSeveral restoration projects have been started in recent years, most of which were to fix the deteriorating masonry on the main house, the play house, and the various walks. The Edsel Ford house relies on donations as well as an original trust set up by Mrs. Ford to continue restoration work. Mrs. Ford left a total of $15,000,000 USD when she handed the house over in trust in the 1970s. In 2007 the fund reached a value of $98,000,000 USD.\n\nThe house has undergone multiple large scale restoration projects, including new roofing which was conducted by a firm from England using five professional masons. The roof was torn down to the base wood all of which was replaced where needed. The stone was selected to match the existing stone from the same quarry as the original.\n\nThe restoration projects are done by skilled craftsmen who have had proven previous experience in their fields. The foundation selects bidders for projects based on their previous experience, portfolio and firms that can provide near original/original material over pricing to ensure that the estate is restored to the original construction specifications.\n\nThe most recent restoration project was to replace the sandstone pillars on the outside of the lakefront patio, which had started to crack around the upper edges. To ensure complete historical accuracy the foundation contracted a firm from the same region from where the original stone was purchased.\n\nThere are still many rooms where visitors are not permitted, including the basement. While the estate houses 60-plus rooms as well as other buildings, the public tours usually only showcase 20 of them. Occasionally the other rooms, such as staff living quarters, are showcased in specific tours. Though a number of rooms in the north upstairs wing of the house hold administrative offices, these are not shown to the public. Some of the rooms are still in less than desirable condition, and restoration projects hope to have the entire estate in show-worthy condition within the next few years.\n\n\n"}

These statements are usually written, but they could be oral. \n\nEducation occurs in many forms for many purposes through many institutions. Examples include early childhood education, kindergarten through to 12th grade, two and four year colleges or universities, graduate and professional education, adult education and job training. Therefore, education policy can directly affect the education people engage in at all ages.\n\nExamples of areas subject to debate in education policy, specifically from the field of schools, include school size, class size, school choice, school privatization, tracking, teacher selection, education and certification, teacher pay, teaching methods, curricular content, graduation requirements, school infrastructure investment, and the values that schools are expected to uphold and model.\n\nIssues in education policy also address problems within higher education. The Pell Institute analyzes the barriers experienced by teachers and students within community colleges and universities. These issues involve undocumented students, sex education, and federal grant aides.\n\nEducation policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy. It seeks to answer questions about the purpose of education, the objectives (societal and personal) that it is designed to attain, the methods for attaining them and the tools for measuring their success or failure. Research intended to inform education policy is carried out in a wide variety of institutions and in many academic disciplines. Important researchers are affiliated with departments of psychology, economics, sociology, and human development, in addition to schools and departments of education or public policy. Examples of education policy analysis may be found in such academic journals as \"Education Policy Analysis Archives\" and in university policy centers such as the National Education Policy Center housed at the University of Colorado Boulder University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nEducation reform is a topic that is in the mainstream currently in the United States. Over the past 30 years, policy makers have made a steady increase at the state and federal levels of government in their involvement of US schools. US states spend most of their budgets funding schools, whereas only a small portion of the federal budget is allocated to education. Although states hold the constitutional right on education policy, the federal government is advancing their role by building on state and local education policies. In the state of Texas during the 84th Legislature, there were several education reform bills filed and sponsored by many education reform groups, such as Texans for Education Reform. Lawmakers want to create more involvement at the local level, and more transparency in our public schools. These groups are being pressured and opposed by teachers' unions saying that accountability and transparency policies are targeting educators, and that they are trying to hold them responsible for the education system.\n\nTeacher policy is education policy that addresses the preparation, recruitment, and retention of teachers. A teacher policy is guided by the same overall vision and essential characteristics as the wider education policy: it should be strategic, holistic, feasible, sustainable, and context-sensitive. Overall objectives and major challenges to be addressed, the funding to achieve these objectives, the demographic parameters of the learner population and the human resources required to achieve universally accessible quality education should all be addressed in a comprehensive teacher policy.\n\nNine key dimensions are considered crucial to any comprehensive teacher policy: Teacher Recruitment and Retention, Teacher education (initial and continuing), Deployment, Career Structures/Paths, Teacher Employment and Working Conditions, Teach Reward and Remuneration, Teacher Standards, Teacher Accountability, and School Governance.\n\nAn effective education system must have a way to attract and retain outstanding educators. There has been a growing demand for teachers but the supply continues to diminish and many of them leave their profession. This development is a threat to the “academic and economic welfare of students.” It affects learning and drain taxpayers’ money. The federal and state governments along with the districts must invest in complete human capital systems. It is the best approach in preparing and retaining committed and capable mentors for the long-term. A reasonable strategy in talent management for the education sector must focus on recruitment, development, and retention of intelligent and efficient teachers. \n\nTeachers need to go back to school periodically to become better educators. Good mentors can become outstanding by going further than textbooks. This is the logic behind continuing education. Technology in the form of web-based workshops and lectures will be helpful. School administrators and district officials must push their teachers to make use of available resources and opportunities to continue the learning process. Conferences with workshops are also valuable because these activities provide teachers with tools for integration of technology in the classrooms and Continuing Professional Development Units in boosting their careers. \n\n\nInformation on education policy, OECD - Contains indicators and information about education policy in OECD countries.\n\n"}

He is the owner of the football clubs Olympiacos in Greece and Nottingham Forest in England.\n\nEvangelos Marinakis was born in Piraeus, Greece on 30 July 1967. He is the only son of Miltiadis Marinakis and Irini Marinaki (\"née\" Karakatsani). His father, Miltiadis Marinakis, was a shipowner, a Member of the Greek Parliament and, at times, a financial supporter of Piraeus football club, Olympiacos. Evangelos Marinakis earned a B.A. in 'International Business Administration' and an M.Sc. in 'International Relations' in London.\n\nMarinakis is the founder and chairman of Capital Maritime & Trading Corp. From March 2010 until September 2011, he also served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NYSE-listed Crude Carriers Corp. Between March 2007 and December 2014 he was chairman of Capital Product Partners L.P. (NASDAQ:CPLP). From 1992 to 2005, Marinakis was the commercial manager of Capital Ship Management Corp. and oversaw the businesses of the group of companies that now form Capital Maritime. For the past decades, he has also been active in several other family-controlled businesses all related to the shipping industry.\n\nHaving \"grown his shipping empire from the small company he took over from his father, which controlled seven bulk carriers\", he is regarded as one of the most important and influential shipping personalities worldwide. He was included in the Lloyd's List \"One Hundred Most Influential People in the Shipping Industry\" list, ranking 66th in 2017, ranking 61st in 2016, ranking 65th in 2015, 67th in 2014, 73rd in 2013 and 84th in 2012. He was also included in the TradeWinds \"Power 100\" list of the ‘top shipowners and operators\", ranking 31st in 2012 and 75th in 2010. In 2014 and 2010 he was awarded the \"Newsmaker of the Year\" award at the annual Lloyd's List \"Greek Shipping Awards\", while in 2009 his company, Capital Ship Management Corp. was awarded the \"Tanker Company of the Year\" award. In 2016, he was awarded the first ever \"Xenakoudis Excellence in Shipping Award\" by the International Registries, Inc./The Marshall Islands Registry. \n\nIn November 2017, Marinakis received the Lloyd’s List \"Greek Shipping Personality of the Year\" Award at a special ceremony in Athens. Nigel Lowry of Lloyd’s List said Marinakis was the \"outstanding candidate\" for the award and noted his $1 billion investment in fleet capacity in 2017, his \"dynamic dealmaking\" in the shipping sector, as well as a range of other activities across philanthropy, sports and media.\n\nIn May 2014, Marinakis was elected first member of the Piraeus city council with the \"Piraeus Winner\" independent ticket, that he co-founded with Yannis Moralis, vice-president of Olympiacos F.C.. Among their pledges were the preservation of the public nature of Piraeus Port Authority and the development of Piraeus as Europe’s largest cruise ship destination and home port. During the elections, his political opponent, Vassilis Michaloliakos, claimed Marinakis was related with the far right political party Golden Dawn and accused him for its financial support. Marinakis rejected these accusations stating \"I condemn Golden Dawn's criminal activity\".\n\nAfter the election, \"Reuters\" declared that \"rarely has big business mingled so openly with politics in a country where contacts between the two are usually conducted behind the scenes\". Marinakis responded, in a Tradewinds interview, that he can see no reason why someone with a strong record in business cannot get into politics, \"calling that stance \"Palaiolithic logic\". \"I am not afraid to be involved in politics, because I have no business with the Greek state\" he said. Since the elections, he undertook the construction of squares, parks, children’s playgrounds and sports facilities, at his own cost, as the municipality of Piraeus lacks the necessary funds due to the economic crisis.\n\nSince mid-2010 Marinakis has owned Piraeus' hometown team Olympiacos, and serves as its President. Marinakis served as president of the Superleague Greece and vice-president of the Hellenic Football Federation (HFF) from August 2010 until September 2011. During his presidency of Olympiacos, the team won the Greek League title for seven consecutive seasons from 2010–11 to 2016–17, and the National Cup for the 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2014–15 seasons.\n\nIn May 2017, it was announced that Marinakis had completed a transaction to become the majority shareholder in English Championship club and former double European Cup winners Nottingham Forest. \n\nThe \"Nottingham Post\" noted that Marinakis’ acquisition of the club heralds “an exciting future that gives genuine reason for optimism”. Meanwhile, manager Mark Warburton commented that he expects Marinakis and his team to be ambitious for Nottingham Forest. “..they are aware of the club's stature and they are good football people,” Warburton was quoted as saying. \n\nIn September 2016, Marinakis, through his company Alter Ego Media S.A., won one of four national television licenses auctioned in Greece after spending EUR 73.9m ($82.8m) in a highly unusual competitive bidding process. The license was however revoked on 26 October 2016 since the Greek Council of State held that the TV license law of Minister of State Nikos Pappas was unconstitutional.\n\nIn July 2017, Alter Ego was confirmed by a Greek first-instance court as the acquirer of the Lambrakis Press Group (DOL). The court approval for the transfer ownership of DOL to Alter Ego followed the latter’s success as the highest bidder in an auction process held earlier in 2017. The court ratified the sale and granted a request by DOL staff that the auction procedure be accepted as valid. The completion of the transfer of ownership was also supported by trade unions representing DOL staff. DOL is one of Greece’s historic major media groups and includes the top selling Ta Nea and To Vima newspapers, two of the country's oldest dailies, as well as a popular news portal, magazines and radio station. As of March 2018 the agreement for DOL has not yet been approved by the Competition Committee. It also holds a 22% stake in Mega Channel TV station. \n\nHe has a role as a philanthropist, both privately and as president of Olympiacos F.C. He personally supports the operation of the museum dedicated to the Greek author Nikos Kazantzakis in the island of Crete with €80,000 yearly for an initial period of 10 years from July 2014. In September 2014, he privately financed commemorative celebrations for the 200 years since the foundation of the Filiki Etairia and the creation of a bust of Alexander Ypsilantis in Athens. He has also privately supported throughout the years various Greek children charities, including Argo, and 'Together for Children', a union of ten Greek NGOs.\n\nDuring his presidency, Olympiacos FC, has funded the daily meals of a thousand people weekly, through the benevolent fund of \"Genesios Theotokos\" parish in the Athens suburb of Nikaia and the Syros Holy Church. Approximately a thousand food portions and clothing items were distributed daily to refugees stranded at the Port of Piraeus. In February 2014, he donated €500,000 for school repairs in the Greek island of Cephalonia, which was hit by destructive earthquakes. In October 2013, Olympiacos and UNICEF launched a partnership to immunize children in developing countries, featuring UNICEF’s logo on the players’ jerseys, with the target to raise €2 million in two years. In August 2017, the club announced that the partnership would be renewed with a focus on a new multi-year campaign. In June 2012, Marinakis repurchased Greek national debt, with a face value of €1,364,000 by offering the amount of €168,590 on behalf of each of Olympiacos' 55 Greek players and employees, to Peter Nomikos’ NGO ‘Greece Debt Free’ (GDF). In the past, Olympiacos has supported the Japan earthquake relief fund, and acted in support to the non-profit environmental organization ‘Arcturos’, the pediatric clinics of ‘St Sofia’ hospital in Athens and the ‘General Hospital’ in Limassol, various blood collection campaigns, Greek and international children’s charities, including 'Elpida', the ‘Steven Gerrard Foundation’, the ‘Hatzikyriakos Foundation’. Marinakis is also in the process of creating the Olympiacos charity foundation.\n\nIn September 2017, Marinakis sponsored a special conference in Athens in partnership with Harvard University, to focus on football’s social responsibility, with specific reference to refugees. At the event, Marinakis said: \"football can cross borders, overcome ancient enmity and bring millions of people around the world together.\" In November 2017, Marinakis led an aid effort, through Olympiacos FC, to bring relief to the victims of massive flooding that hit the town of Mandra in the Attica region of Greece. The effort, included a large quantity of food, bottled water, and other daily necessities sent to those struggling in the aftermath of the flooding. In July 2018, Marinakis donated €1 million through Olympiacos FC, to help the victims of the deadliest wildfires to hit Greece in decades, which swept through an area near Athens. \"In these difficult times, all us Greeks need to stand united at the side of our fellow citizens who suffer\", the team said in a statement. \n\nOn 21 February 2011, Olympiacos beat Panathinaikos in Karaiskaki Stadium (2–1), after a controversial, regarding the referee's decisions, game. After the game, player Djibril Cissé had a wrangle with Olympiacos' president Marinakis. He was beaten by Olympiakos' fans and stated that he was going to appeal to the UEFA. The case of Cissé and Marinakis went to the Greek courts, where Marinakis was found innocent.\n\nIn 2015, the Public Prosecutor and the Council of Judges acquitted Marinakis in relation to the Koriopolis match-fixing investigation, that begun in 2011, that was launched after UEFA gave Greek authorities a report citing irregular betting patterns, mostly involving Greek Cup and second division games in 2009 and 2010. He was accused of participating in a match-fixing criminal network with links with seven countries. At the time, UEFA officials said no action was presently being considered against Olympiacos regarding its participation in the Champions League in the following season, because evidence in the Greek investigation cast no doubt over its 2010–11 league victory. Marinakis was charged with complicity to commit acts of bribery and match manipulation, of instigation and facilitating acts of violence. Marinakis, along with the president of second-division club Ilioupoli, Giorgos Tsakogiannis and others, cooperated so that a group of hardcore Olympiacos fans would travel on 13 March 2011 to a third division match and provoke riots to bring about a penalty. The prosecutor’s report says that \"Tsakogiannis informed [Ioannis] Papadopoulos that he had made arrangements and Evangelos Marinakis was aware of the plan for Olympiacos fans to cause riots\". Marinakis was acquitted from all charges by the Prosecutor, Panagiotis Poulios, and the Council of Judges.\n\nIn 2014, Marinakis was acquitted by the Three Members Court of First Instance relatively to the case of entering the referee's (Thanassis Yiachos's) locker room at halftime during the football cup final between Olympiacos and Asteras Tripolis, against football regulations to complain about the decisions taken. Marinakis stated that he went to the referee’s locker room at halftime only to wish match officials \"good luck\". Olympiacos went on and won the match 3–1, after a tense 1–1 at halftime. In 2015 Marinakis was also acquitted by the Three Members Court of Appeals for the same case.\n\nAnother investigation which led to the 2015 Greek football scandal, started in 2014 after prosecutor Aristidis Koreas was given the go-ahead by a council of judges to make use of secretly recorded phone conversations that point to the involvement of various sports officials, including Evangelos Marinakis. According to Koreas, \"the president of Olympiakos and close associates approached and tried to use policemen, judges, politicians and other powerful figures for their own ends as part of the planning and establishment of a criminal organization\". According to the prosecutor, Marinakis was helped by the President of the Greek Football Association, Giorgos Sarris, to choose specific referees to oversee key games. He has repeatedly denied all charges: \"These allegations have nothing to do with me and have no effect on me whatsoever,\" Marinakis said. \"There is not one shred of evidence against me.\" On 3 October 2014, Aristidis Koreas, though he was replaced as athletic prosecutor, he remained on the case. Evangelos Marinakis was questioned on 18 June 2015 and he was released on a €200,000 bail. He was also forced to stop being involved in any football activity, as well as he must report to a police station every 15 days. In September 2016, the prosecutor proposed the imprisonment of Mr Marinakis. In November 2017, the judicial council of the Court of Appeals rejected imposing provisional custody on Evangelos Marinakis and also dropped various charges after deeming them \"absolutely groundless\". Marinakis was also resigned from president of the team due to legal reasons, giving his seat to Yiannis Moralis. On 26 March 2018, Marinakis was vindicated by the Greek Supreme Court. The decision of the Greek Supreme Court confirmed that the allegations against him were unfounded.\n\nIn March 2018, Marinakis was charged with trafficking heroin by public prosecutor Irene Tziva. The accusations against Marinakis were described as \"very serious charges\" following a three-year investigation after the tanker Noor One was intercepted at the Greek port of Piraeus carrying 2.1 tonnes of heroin in 2014. He has also been charged with financing an illegal operation.\n\nNottingham Forest F.C. chairman Nicholas Randall wrote an open letter to supporters reaffirming his support for Evangelos Marinakis. Randall confirmed the matter was under investigation but that \"there is no ‘charge’ against Marinakis and no ‘prosecution’ is in process.\"\n"}

{"id": "715674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=715674", "title": "George Mathews (Georgia)", "text": "George Mathews (Georgia)\n\nGeorge Mathews ( – ) was a Continental Army officer during the American Revolutionary War and rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general; he was Governor of Georgia, and a U.S. Congressman. He was the leading participant in the Patriot War of East Florida, an 1810–1812 filibuster expedition to capture Spanish Florida for the United States.\n\nBorn in Augusta County, Virginia, Mathews was in early life a merchant and planter. He quickly became a senior officer in the colonial forces, and was credited along with Colonel Andrew Lewis for the victory of the Virginia provincial militia against the Shawnee and Mingo Indian tribes in the Battle of Point Pleasant of Dunmore's War. He was afterward a member of the House of Burgesses from Augusta County. He attended the First Virginia Convention when the Virginia General Assembly was dissolved by royal governor Lord Dunmore.\n\nOn the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War Mathews led the 9th Virginia Regiment of the Continental Army to the Battle of Brandywine in September 1777. He and his entire regiment were captured in the Battle of Germantown the following month. He spent the next four years as a prisoner of war, including two years on the British prison ship . He was exchanged on December 5, 1781. He was breveted to the rank of brigadier general on September 30, 1783. He was an original member of the Virginia Society of the Cincinnati.\n\nAfter the war, he moved to the state of Georgia and was quickly elected to the Georgia General Assembly. The same year he was elected 20th governor of the state. He served two terms as governor, and one intermittent term in Congress, during which he voted to ratify the United States Constitution. During his second administration he quietly allowed the creation of the rogue state of the Trans-Oconee Republic, headed by General Elijah Clarke. He oversaw the removal of the state when public opinion, coupled with pressure from the Federal government, shifted. His administration was later tainted by the Yazoo Land Fraud, which ultimately led to his retirement from politics.\n\nMathews relocated to the Mississippi Territory and in 1810 was assigned a filibuster operation by President James Madison to incite an insurrection in East Florida and capture the territory for the United States. This initiative is now referred to as the Patriot War of East Florida. Mathews had launched the insurrection, capturing Ferninanda Beach and Amelia Island, before the secret mission was recalled and disowned by President Madison, fearing war with Spain and its allies. On learning of the recall, Mathews set out to Washington to confront Madison on the decision. He died in Augusta, Georgia on his way to the capital. He is buried at St. Paul's Episcopal Church.\n\nGeorge Mathews was born on August 30, 1739 in Augusta County, Virginia to Anne (née Archer) and John Mathews. His parents immigrated to America during the early years of the Scotch-Irish on 1717–1775. His father was a successful member of the early Augusta County community and sent George and his siblings to the Augusta Academy, a local classical school founded in 1749.\n\nBy the 1760s George and a brother, Sampson Mathews had acquired extensive property along the western frontier as far west as the Greenbrier district, and set up several outpost along this stretch. They sold both frontier necessities and specialty goods and their imports included Atlantic trade markets. He was active in civic affairs of his community, holding the offices of sheriff, vestryman, and justice of the peace for Augusta County, and he was regularly involved in skirmishes against local Native American tribes, who frequently conducted raids into the colonies. His father's farm was raided on at least one occasion.\n\nIn the fall of 1774, Royal Governor Lord Dunmore assembled an invasion of Native American Virginia territory as a result of the rising tension between the two peoples, culling a thousand troops largely from the Virginia frontier. George Mathews was commissioned captain of Augusta County militia under Colonel Andrew Lewis, whom he accompanied to Point Pleasant, Virginia (now West Virginia). The October 1774 Battle of Point Pleasant of Dunmore's War was fought between Virginia militia and Native Americans from the Shawnee and Mingo tribes along the Ohio River. The Native Americans, under the Shawnee Chief Cornstalk, attacked Virginia militia under Col. Lewis, attempting to halt Lewis's advance into the Ohio Country. Rembert Patrick described the battle as \"a typical Indian battle where every man found a tree, and military discipline in the English sense was unknown.\" Mathews was credited with a flanking maneuver late in the battle that initiated Cornstalk's retreat. He gained statewide fame from the battle was elected to the House of Burgesses for the 1774 session, though Governor Dunmore dissolved the assembly before it convened. In May 1774, he attended the First Virginia Convention. The Burgesses, operating as the First Virginia Convention, met on August 1, 1774 and elected representatives to the Second Virginia Convention, banned commerce and payment of debts with Britain, and pledged aid and supplies to the American Revolution.\n\nGeorge Mathews was commissioned colonel of the 9th Virginia Regiment in the Continental Army on the outbreak of the Revolutionary War and led the regiment north to join the General George Washington and the Continental Army for the Battle of Brandywine of the Philadelphia campaign. The battle, fought between Washington's army and the British army of General Sir William Howe on September 11, 1777, consisted primarily of hand-to-hand bayonet combat. The British defeated the Americans and forced them to withdraw toward the rebel capital of Philadelphia. Mathews was credited for saving the American army from rout at the battle, during which he was said to have been stabbed 5–7 times. Alexander Scott Withers declared him the \"hero of Brandywine.\" The following month, he and his entire regiment were killed, captured, or scattered at the Battle of Germantown, a second clash between generals Washington and Howe. Mathews led a charge early in the day that resulted in the capture up to 100 British soldiers; however, as the day progressed, his regiment had penetrated so deeply into British lines that it became isolated from Washington's army and was engulfed by opposing troops. The given reasons for his capture vary; some claim he did not receive Washington's orders to retreat, while others claim his regiment became lost in the fog and smoke of battle. He spent much of the remaining revolution as a prisoner of war, at first held at Philadelphia. When the British withdrew from there, he was moved to the prison ship , anchored in New York harbor.\nBy 1779 he was granted a limited \"parole\" and permitted to live in New York City. He wrote to Governor Thomas Jefferson and to the Continental Congress urging a prisoner exchange. Jefferson wrote to Mathews to explain his decision to leave him in New York City as a parolee and instead exchange for others still suffering on the prison ships:\n\nHe was finally exchanged on December 5, 1781, at which point he went south with Major General Nathaniel Greene, campaigning in South Carolina and Georgia and fighting with Greene at the Battle of Guilford Court House. He was named commander of the 12th Virginia Regiment, but this was only a nominal command, since his new regiment had been prisoners since the fall of Charleston in May 1780. He was brevetted to the rank of brigadier general on September 30, 1781.\n\nMathews was impressed with the opportunities for political and financial gain on the Georgia frontier during his campaign with Gen. Greene. When he was released from service in 1783, he bought land in Wilkes County, augmenting that with land grants given for Revolutionary War service. He liquidated his Virginia property, and moved his family to a log cabin there. He and his wife, Polly, would raise their children there and in their later, larger house. In all, they had eight: John, Charles Lewis, George, William, Ann, Jane, Margaret, and Rebecca.\nHe became a judge in Wilkes County, and a town commissioner for Washington, Georgia. In 1787 he was a successful candidate for the Georgia Assembly.\n\nHis bearing and military experience gained the respect of the other members, and they named him 20th Governor of Georgia in 1787. Following his term in the governor's office he was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1789 for one term, during which he attended the state convention to ratify the United States Constitution. His identification as a Federalist and his involvement in land speculation caused him to lose the election for the U.S. Senate in 1792. But, by 1793 he had regained enough support to again be chosen governor.\n\nHis second administration was more tumultuous than his first. In February 1794, General Elijah Clarke, a popular veteran of the American Revolutionary War, lead an expedition to establish an independent state west of the Oconee River—on hunting grounds reserved by the federal Treaty of New York (1790) exclusively for the Creek Indians. Georgia had not been consulted on the original treaty and many Georgians viewed it unfavorably because they saw it as limiting the possibilities for the future expansion of their state.\n\nClarke's frontiersmen made settlements on lands in present-day Greene, Morgan, Putnam, and Baldwin counties of Georgia. The settlers built several towns and forts over the next few months. They also wrote and ratified their own constitution, indicating the permanent intention of their endeavor. With little overt opposition from the Creek, they were taking control of the lands before the state or federal governments could react.\n\nThe United States government viewed Clarke's actions as a violation of the Treaty of New York, which provided recognition of Creek lands in an effort to maintain peace and guarantee their neutrality. President George Washington pressured Mathews to remove the illegal settlers from the Creek lands. Mathews initially ignored the \"unauthorized military expedition\", because he shared the state's resentment of the treaty and was aware of Clarke's popularity as a hero of the Revolution. He took only token measures to stop Clarke and his party, such as issuing a proclamation in July 1794 that went unenforced. It is unlikely that Mathews had enough public support to move against Clarke at that juncture, but the tide of public opinion eventually changed and he took actions to remove the rogue general from power. In September, 1200 Georgia militiamen, acting in conjunction with federal troops stationed on the Oconee, surrounded and isolated General Clarke's fortifications. After some negotiation, Clarke agreed to surrender, provided that he and his men would not face prosecution for their actions. Clarke and his followers departed, and the militia burned down the new settlements and fortifications.\nMathews' popularity waned, in 1794 he turned to land speculation in an effort to maintain his popularity. He, along with other high-ranking Georgia officials, issued several grants of land for the same parcels, at times granting up to three times more land than existed. Four new companies: the Georgia Company, the Georgia-Mississippi Company, the Upper Mississippi Company, and the new Tennessee Company, persuaded the Georgia state assembly to sell more than 40,000,000 acres (160,000 km2) of land for $500,000. Many Georgia officials and legislators were to be stockholders in these companies. On January 7, 1795, Mathews signed into law a bill authorizing the sale of the 40,000,000 acres (160,000 km2), known as the Yazoo Act.\n\nWhen the details were revealed, public outrage was widespread, and people protested to federal officials and Congressmen. Jared Irwin and U.S. Senator James Jackson led the reform efforts: Irwin was elected Governor of Georgia and, less than two months after taking office, signed a bill on February 13, 1796 nullifying the Yazoo Act. The state burned all copies of the bill except for one that had been sent to President George Washington. Jackson resigned as Senator to run for office as next Governor of Georgia. He was elected and took office two years later.\n\nMathews started afresh in the Mississippi Territory. His wife Polly had died, so he married a widow, Mary (Fairchild) (Lewis) Carpenter (widow of Richard Carpenter, 1729–1788.), who owned property there. He again returned to land speculation, buying stock in a land company the claimant of extensive acreage in the territory. A few years later he would also return to politics.\n\nIn 1798 he was appointed governor of the newly formed territory of Mississippi by President John Adams. Secretary of War James McHenry objected to the appointment, citing Mathews' financial stake in the territory. When Adams withdrew the nomination, Mathews was reported to have responded: \"Sir, if you had known me, you wouldn't have taken the nomination back; if you didn't know me, you should not have nominated me to such an important office.\"\n\n\"The East Florida revolution of 1812 was an embarrassing and shameful moment in the history of early American foreign policy.\" \n\nIn 1810, Mathews was recommended to President James Madison by Georgia Senator William Harris Crawford as a confidential agent to report on conditions in the Spanish Floridas, as Crawford believed an annexation of the territory to the United States was possible. Fearing the collapse of Spanish rule, President Madison sent Mathews to meet with Spanish governor of West Florida, Don Vicente Folch, in November, 1810, to inform the residents of East Florida that if they were to separate from Spain they would be welcomed into the United States. Folch indicated to Mathews that he was willing to transfer West Florida to the United States peacefully. Madison, on receiving this information, decided to try to annex both East and West Florida all at once, seeking to take West Florida peacefully and giving Mathews \"official instructions to assist a revolutionary movement in East Florida.\" Mathews was assigned an Indian agent, John McKee. The president, seeking to keep the United States seemingly removed from the plan, gave them instructions that were \"remarkably vague and general.\"\n\nMathews, then at 72 years of age, returned to the Spanish state with a commission of brigadier general and again met with Governor Folch. Folch had gone cold on the trade and told Mathews that he did not intend to negotiate with Madison for the West. Mathews delivered the message to the White House, at which point Secretary of State James Monroe instructed Mathews to focus on forceful annexation of East Florida, \"if he thought he could accomplish anything there.\"\n\nMathews and McKee proceeded in the subsequent months to create an intelligence network throughout East Florida to ascertain the political attitudes of the East Floridians towards the United States, determining that an insurrection against Spanish rule was achievable. Mathews became infected with malaria during the campaign, delaying the operation several months. Isaac Cox wrote that Mathews \"spent the summer of 1811 alternately fighting malaria and encouraging insurrection.\"\n\nOn March 13, 1812, Mathews, with a force of Georgians, launched his revolution at Fernandina on Amelia Island. With Mathews, the local insurgents known as the \"Patriots of Amelia Island\" seized the island and declared their independence. They hoisted a new flag of East Florida, designed by a member of Mathews' staff. He then turned his focus inland, writing to the President to convey the success and to request additional United States military personnel.\n\nAs the insurrection grew, Congress became alarmed at the possibility of being drawn into war with Spain and their allies, the British. (However, a few months later the U.S. declared war on Britain, setting off the War of 1812). Mathews' operation had grown large enough and quickly enough that the United States could no longer deny involvement. Madison was forced to repudiate the mission, and the effort fell apart. He and his cabinet would deny all involvement in the matter. Mathews decided to go to Washington to appeal his case personally. But, on the trip he became ill and was forced to stop in Augusta, Georgia. He died without reaching Washington.\n\nHistorians have been divided over the legacy of the Patriot War of East Florida. Some agree that Mathews overstepped his authority and deliberately departed from Madison's intentions. Historian J.C.A. Stagg, in \"George Mathews and John McKee, Revolutionizing East Florida, Mobile, and Pensacola in 1812\" (2007), found sufficient evidence in correspondence between Mathews and Madison to determine that Mathews exaggerated his \"remarkably vague\" instructions and acted well beyond Madison's intent.\nOthers believe Mathews had followed Madison's intentions, and that Madison had disowned the filibuster for political reasons, sacrificing Mathews' reputation in the process. Historian G. Melvin Herndon, in \"George Mathews, Frontier Patriot\" (1969), offered a vindicating perspective for Mathews and places blame for the failure of the expedition on Madison for repudiating the assignment.\n\nMathews died on his 73rd birthday, August 30, 1812, in Augusta, Georgia, while on his way to Washington to confront President Madison over the repudiation of his filibuster expedition. He is buried in St. Paul's Churchyard there.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the founder of Cool Group, which comprises over 50 companies.\nAt age 30, Issa's first business venture was a petrol station named Cool Oasis, which was the catalyst for the Group becoming the largest Jamaican owned operator of petrol stations in Jamaica. \nIn 2003, he set up a telephone card distribution business called Cool Card. Later, he extended the distribution business to include automotive and household products, among others, under the Cool brand. \nOver the next decade, the Cool brand grew rapidly into a group of over 50 companies engaged in a wide variety of activities.\n\nIssa was born in Kingston. His father is Chairman of SuperClubs Resort, John Issa, 29 December 1939 – present. Issa's father was placed among the top 10 personalities of the decade 1990–2000. Issa received his secondary school education at Campion College in Kingston.\n\nIn 1985 he became the 11th member of the Issa families to attend College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA, where he pursued an accountancy degree, which included one year at the London School of Economics (LSE) in the United Kingdom.\nHe graduated in 1988 and Valedictorian Cum Laude with a number of awards, including the youngest resident Jamaican to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).\n\nUpon returning home from university, he joined SuperClubs Resorts, which his father had started in the early 1980s.\n\nIssa started work as the purchasing manager at the Grand Lido Negril, one of SuperClubs chain of resorts. He became Resident Manager of the hotel a year later. During the next three years, Issa helped to reorganize the hotel as a resort for romantic vacations and honeymooners.\n\nIn 1991 he assumed the position of general manager of Couples Hotel, the first to be established as an all-inclusive by his father in 1978 when Issa was 12 years old. He oversaw the refurbishment of the hotel. Issa was moved to the money-losing Grand Lido San Souci, which he made profitable within six months.\nIn 1995, Issa was promoted to President of Development and Special Projects in the corporate office, a position in which he was involved in developing the various brands, including the establishment of new properties. He was subsequently promoted to Senior VP of Sales in 1996, and initiated a customer satisfaction program which led to increased bookings and sustained brand loyalty through repeat visits.\n\nIn 1999, when Issa became Executive Vice-President, he instituted marketing programmes, including the establishment of a new website to take reservations online 24/7, which led to higher occupancy levels. He remained at the helm of SuperClubs until 2003, when he left to concentrate his own business, the Cool Group of Companies trading as Cool Corp.\n\nIn 1994 created a company called Cool Corp, and started by opening a petrol station in St. Ann's Bay named Cool Oasis. The company grew strategically over the years as Issa engaged in various business ventures.\n\nIn 2001, Cool Automotive Distributors was established to deliver motor oil and lubricants to gas stations, auto stores, companies with fleet vehicles and trucking companies. IN 2014, it is one of the leading retailers of automobile-related lubricants and accessories in Jamaica, and also sells basic household products such as toilet paper and soap.\n\nIn 2002, Issa formed Cool Card to distribute telephone cards in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, offering phone cards from Jamaica's three cellular phone providers, Digicel, Cable & Wireless and MiPhone, and both cellular providers in Trinidad and Tobago, Digicel and bMobile. In 2003, he created Cool Biz, and introduced 'EZ Card' an electronic top-up of telephone credit operated by over 3,000 individuals.\n\nIn 2005, Issa started Cool Petroleum, which became the licensed user of Shell brands in Jamaica. The company distributed Shell bulk fuels, Shell chemicals and Shell lubricants, and operasted an extensive network of more than 50 Shell service stations.\n\nIn April 2006, Issa started Cool Cash Loans, a provider of loans for micro businesses.\n\nOther business ventures include:\n\n\nIssa undertook a number of extra-curricular activities while attending College of the Holy Cross in the US. He was the founder and editor of Holy Cross Journal of Political Economy in 1988. He also had a radio programme through which he informed of Jamaica's culture and heritage while playing Reggae music.\nWhile attending London School of Economics, he became President of the Afro-Caribbean Society, a multi-ethnic group which undertakes high-level discussions on social, political and economic development throughout the world.\n\nIssa also founded a charity, Educate the Children Fund, while at LSE and was active in fundraising to send school books to Caribbean children.\n\nWhen he returned to Jamaica in 1988, his passion for advocacy did not wane, especially as it relates to a credible social and economic environment, and accountability in governance.\n\nIn 2000, Issa participated in media discussions on the impact of the high murder rate on foreign direct investments (FDIs) and economic growth in Jamaica. Issa also commented on the state of the tourism industry, advocating for government support to the small hotel sector and seeking to stem a brewing controversy of variable head tax rates for different cruise ship ports.\n\nIn 2001, Issa addressed public concerns about political corruption by suggesting paying politicians more, Issa had based his position on KPMG Peat Marwick figures which showed that politicians earn significantly less than top civil servants and private sector counterparts.\n\nThe following year, ahead of the 16 October, general elections, Issa took a stand for accountability in governance with what became known as the \"Issa Initiative\", calling for those seeking political office sign a pledge with their constituents promising that if elected, they would address two pivotal issues in their constituencies within a reasonable period of time. The idea resonated with people across the country and was supported by the two main political parties – the Jamaica Labour Party and the People's National Party. \"The Gleaner\" newspaper called it a watershed in Jamaica's political culture, and said \"the proposal from Joe Issa of the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce, which was taken up by the island's Chambers of Commerce has the potential of bringing about a change in the relationship between constituents and their elected representatives,\" and that \"it would require a greater level of consultation between those who are seeking political office and those who they hope to represent, on the priority needs of the constituencies.\" A cartoon in The Gleaner depicted a politician telling an agitated female constituent, \"just vote fi mi an' yu get light, water, telephone, roads, etc.\", while Issa steps behind him with a covenant and pen, asking, \"care to sign a pledge for just two of those?\"\n\nIssa represented the island's 13 Chambers of Commerce during negotiations with the government concerning the Cess on street lights, intervening to avoid a threatened protest march.\n\nIn 1987, Issa founded the \"Educate the Children Fund\" while attending the LSE. The school adopted the program, and the Fund was officially launched by Jamaica's then Acting High Commissioner in London, Dale Anderson. In his remarks, Anderson said Issa's initiative was particularly welcome at a time of scarce resources.\nA year later, after completing his studies at College of the Holy Cross and becoming a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Issa launched the Joe Issa Holy Cross/Jamaica Scholarship Fund, which provided a scholarship to a talented undergraduate Jamaican child once every four years to attend his alma mater university.\nIn 1991, while he was working at his parents' SuperClubs Grand Lido Negril resort, Issa launched a cricket and tennis training programme for young children in the parish of Negril.\n\nIn the new millennium, Issa founded another charity, \"Global Education 2000\", to help Jamaican schools by partnering them with their US counterparts. The initiative has resulted in the implementation of various exchange programmes which have benefited several Jamaican schools and were widely reported in the Jamaican media.\nAlso, while, at SuperClubs, Issa helped employees at the resorts to buy and develop land under a project called \"People Development Programme\".\n\nSince 2003, as Chairman of Cool Corporation, a group of 'Cool' branded companies that cut across many industries, Issa has set up Cool Charities, and has donated hundreds of computers, books, air conditioners and other school-related supplies primarily to educational institutions in the parishes of St. Mary and St. Ann.\n\nIssa volunteers as a Justice of the Peace (JP) for the parish of St Mary. He is a former director of First Global Bank, Guardian Life Limited and Supreme Ventures Limited; and board member of Seville Great House.\n\nHe has been bestowed with an honorary life membership of the Rotary and Kiwanis clubs and is a past President of the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAlso, since 1983, Issa has been serving as a Eucharistic Minister for the Catholic Church.\n\nIssa was Valedictorian for the Class of 1988, a first for an international student and an Economics/Accounting major in the 148-year history of College of the Holy Cross, where he graduated with honours – Cum Laude.\nHe made history again in 1988, when he became the youngest resident Jamaican to pass all four parts of the prestigious Certified Public Accountant examination in one sitting; and was awarded the Most Outstanding Junior Student by the Massachusetts Society of CPAs Inc.\nIssa is a member of several honours societies, namely, Phi Beta Kappa, Alpha Sigma Nu, and Omicron Delta Epsilon and a Dana Scholar.\n\nIn 1994, at age 29, he was presented with the Young Hotelier of the World award by the International Hotel Association in Sydney, Australia. He was among Travel Agent Magazine's 100 Rising Stars for four consecutive years – 1997–2000.\n\nSoon after taking charge as Executive Vice-President of SuperClubs in 1999, Issa succeeded in increasing bookings and building brand loyalty, which earned him the Jamaica Observer's Tourism's Brightest Spark award and a place among Jamaica's top 10 personalities for that year. The following year, he was among Jamaica's 10 sexiest men.\n\nSince venturing into his own business in 2003, Issa has received several more awards for \"developing a multifaceted group of companies that provide employment for hundreds of people in St. Ann, and in the process creating a powerful 'Cool' brand that is being leveraged abroad\".\n"}

Its tax and advisory services are further divided into various service groups.\n\nThe name \"KPMG\" stands for \"Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler.\" It was chosen when KMG (Klynveld Main Goerdeler) merged with Peat Marwick in 1987.\n\nThe organization's history spanned three centuries. In 1818 John Moxham opened a company in Bristol. James Grace and James Grace Jr. bought John Moaxham & Co. and renamed it James Grace & Son in 1857. In 1861 Henry Grace joined James Jr. and the company was renamed James & Henry Grace. William Barclay Peat joined Robert Fletcher & Co. in London at 17 and became head of the firm in 1891, renamed William Barclay Peat & Co. by then. In 1877 Thomson McLintock founded Thomson McLintock & Co in Glasgow. In 1897 Marwick Mitchell & Co. was founded by James Marwick and Roger Mitchell in New York City. In 1899 Ferdinand William LaFrentz founded the American Audit Co., in New York. In 1923 The American Audit Company was renamed FW LaFrentz & Co. \n\nIn about 1913, Frank Wilber Main founded Main & Co. in Pittsburgh. In March 1917 Piet Klijnveld and Jaap Kraayenhof opened an accounting firm called Klynveld Kraayenhof & Co. in Amsterdam. \n\nIn 1925 William Barclay Peat & Co. and Marwick Mitchell & Co., merged to form Peat Marwick Mitchell.\n\nIn 1963 Main LaFrentz & Co was formed by the merger of Main & Co and FW LaFrentz & Co. In 1969 Thomson McLintock and Main LaFrentz merged forming McLintock Main LaFrentz International and McLintock Main LaFrentz International absorbed the general practice of Grace, Ryland & Co.\n\nIn 1979 Klynveld Kraayenhof & Co. (Netherlands), McLintock Main LaFrentz (United Kingdom / United States) and Deutsche Treuhandgesellschaft (Germany) formed KMG (Klynveld Main Goerdeler) as a grouping of independent national practices to create a strong European-based international firm. Deutsche Treuhandgesellschaft CEO Reinhard Goerdeler (son of leading anti-Nazi activist Carl Goerdeler, who would have become Chancellor if Operation Valkyrie had succeeded) became the first CEO of KMG. In the United States, Main Lafrentz & Co. merged with Hurdman and Cranstoun to form Main Hurdman & Cranstoun.\n\nThen in 1987 KMG and Peat Marwick joined forces in the first mega-merger of large accounting firms and formed a firm called KPMG in the US, and most of the rest of the world, and Peat Marwick McLintock in the UK.\n\nIn the Netherlands, as a consequence of the merger between PMI and KMG in 1988, PMI tax advisors joined Meijburg & Co. (The tax advisory agency Meijburg & Co. was founded by Willem Meijburg, Inspector of National Taxes, in 1939). Today, the Netherlands is the only country with two members of KPMG International: KPMG Audit (accountants) and Meijburg & Co (tax consultants).\n\nIn 1991 the firm was renamed KPMG Peat Marwick, and in 1999 the name was reduced again to KPMG.\n\nIn October 1997, KPMG and Ernst & Young announced that they were to merge. However, while the merger to form PricewaterhouseCoopers was granted regulatory approval, the KPMG/Ernst & Young tie-up was later abandoned.\n\nIn 2001 KPMG divested its U.S. consulting firm through an initial public offering of KPMG Consulting Inc, which is now called BearingPoint, Inc. In early 2009, BearingPoint filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe UK and Dutch consulting arms were sold to Atos Origin in 2002.\n\nIn 2003 KPMG divested itself of its legal arm, Klegal and KPMG LLP sold its Dispute Advisory Services to FTI Consulting.\n\nKPMG's member firms in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein merged to form KPMG Europe LLP in October 2007. These member firms were followed by Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, CIS (Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Georgia), Turkey, Norway, and Saudi Arabia. They appointed joint Chairmen, John Griffith-Jones and Ralf Nonnenmacher.\n\nEach national KPMG firm is an independent legal entity and is a member of KPMG International Cooperative, a Swiss entity registered in the Swiss Canton of Zug. KPMG International changed its legal structure from a Swiss Verein to a co-operative under Swiss law in 2003.\n\nThis structure in which the Cooperative provides support services only to the member firms is similar to other professional services networks. The member firms provide the services to client. The purpose is to limit the liability of each independent member.\n\nBill Thomas is KPMG's Global Chairman. He was formerly Senior Partner and CEO of KPMG LLP, the KPMG member firm in Canada.\n\nSome KPMG member firms are registered as multidisciplinary entities which also provide legal services in certain jurisdictions.\n\nIn India, regulations do not permit foreign auditing firms to operate. Hence KPMG carries out audits in India under the name of BSR & Co, an auditing firm that it bought off. B.S.R & Co was an auditing firm founded by B.S.Raut in Mumbai. In 1992, after India was forced to liberalise as one of the conditions of the world bank and IMF bail out, KPMG was granted a license to operate in India as an investment bank. It subsequently purchased B.S.R & Co and conducts audits in India under the name of this firm.\n\nKPMG is organised into the following three service lines (the 2016 revenue shares are listed in parentheses):\n\n\nTax arrangements relating to tax avoidance and multinational corporations and Luxembourg which were negotiated by KPMG became public in 2014 in the so-called \"Luxembourg Leaks\".\n\nIn March 2017 KPMG launched a campaign designed to encourage more women to pursue careers in technology-based professions.\n\nThe US branch of KPMG was rated one of the top 10 companies for working mothers. It was also ranked No. 12 on Fortune magazine's 2017 list of 100 Best Companies to Work For, voted for by employees.\n\nKPMG was the preferred employer among the Big Four accounting firms according to CollegeGrad.com. It was also ranked No. 4 on the list of \"50 Best Places to Launch a Career\" in 2009 according to Bloomberg Businessweek.\n\nIn 2009, KPMG in the UK was named the best big company to work for by \"The Times\". This was the fourth consecutive year that KPMG had made the top three.\n\nIn 2009, in the UK, KPMG introduced a programme known as 'Flexible Futures'. This allowed staff to volunteer to give the firm the option to either send them on a sabbatical at 30% pay for up to 12 weeks, or to reduce their working hours to 4 days a week. The option remained open to the firm until October 2010. This facility has been invoked by the firm in some departments. KPMG publicised this as innovative and an alternative approach to redundancies.\n\nIn October 2010, for the eighth year in a row, KPMG was named one of \"Canada's Top 100 Employers\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in \"Maclean's\" news magazine. In November 2010, KPMG was also named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers, which was announced by the \"Toronto Star\" newspaper.\n\nIt was reported in early 2012 that KPMG has about 11,000 staff in the UK and 9,000 in mainland China and Hong Kong. KPMG's global deputy chairman predicted that headcount in China would overtake that of the UK by the end of 2013.\n\nKPMG's Innovation Lab is based out of a WeWork in New York City.\n\nIn 2003, the IRS issued summonses to KPMG for information about certain tax shelters and their investors. In February 2004, the US Justice Department commenced a criminal inquiry. The United States member firm, KPMG LLP, was accused by the United States Department of Justice of fraud in marketing abusive tax shelters. KPMG fired or forced the retirement of over a dozen who were involved. KPMG LLP admitted criminal wrongdoing in creating fraudulent tax shelters to help wealthy clients avoid $2.5 billion in taxes between 1996 and 2002, and agreed to pay $456 million in penalties to avoid indictment. Under the deferred prosecution agreement, KPMG LLP would not face criminal prosecution if it complied with the terms of its agreement with the government. On 3 January 2007, the criminal conspiracy charges against KPMG were dropped.\n\nIn 2003, KPMG agreed to pay $125 million and $75 million to settle lawsuits stemming from the firm's audits of Rite Aid and Oxford Health Plans Inc., respectively.\n\nIn 2004, KPMG agreed to pay $115 million to settle lawsuits stemming from the collapse of software company Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products NV.\n\nIn 2006, Fannie Mae sued KPMG for malpractice for approving years of erroneous financial statements.\n\nIn February 2007, KPMG Germany was investigated for ignoring questionable payments in the Siemens bribery case. In November 2008, the Siemens Supervisory Board recommended changing auditors from KPMG to Ernst & Young.\n\nIn March 2008, KPMG was accused of enabling \"improper and imprudent practices\" at New Century Financial, a failed mortgage company, and KPMG agreed to pay $80 million to settle suits from Xerox shareholders over manipulated earnings reports.\n\nIt was announced in December 2008 that two of Tremont Group's Rye Select funds, audited by KPMG, had $2.37 billion invested with the Madoff \"Ponzi scheme.\" Class action suits were filed.\n\nIn August 2010, it was reported by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority to the Swedish accountancy regulator after HQ Bank was forced into involuntary liquidation after the Financial Supervisory Authority revoked all its licences for breach of banking regulations.\n\nIn August 2011, KPMG conducted due diligence work on Hewlett Packard's $11.1 billion acquisition of the British software company Autonomy. In November 2012 HP announced an $8.8 billion write off due to \"serious accounting improprieties\" committed by Autonomy management prior to the acquisition.\n\nAccording to an independent panel formed to investigate irregular payments made by Olympus which reported in December 2011, KPMG's affiliate in Japan did not identify fraud at the company.\n\nIn April 2013, Scott London, a former KPMG LLP partner in charge of KPMG's US Los Angeles-based Pacific Southwest audit practice, admitted passing on stock tips about clients, including Herbalife, Skechers, and other companies, to his friend Bryan Shaw, a California jewelry-store owner. In return Shaw gave London $70,000 as well as gifts that included a $12,000 Rolex watch and concert tickets. On May 6, Shaw agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He also agreed to pay around $1.3 million in restitution, and to cooperate with the government as part of a plea deal with federal prosecutors. This scandal led KPMG to resign as auditor for Herbalife and Sketchers.\n\nIn 2015, KPMG was accused by the Canada Revenue Agency of tax evasion schemes: \"The CRA alleges that the KPMG tax structure was in reality a 'sham' that intended to deceive the taxman.\"\n\nIn 2016, the Canada Revenue Agency was found to have offered an amnesty to KPMG clients caught using an offshore tax-avoidance scheme on the Isle of Man.\n\nIn 2017, KPMG terminated five partners in its audit practice, including the head of its audit practice in the US, after an investigation of advanced confidential knowledge of planned audit inspections by its Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. This followed criticism about KPMG's failure to uncover illegal sales practices at Wells Fargo or potential corruption at FIFA, the governing international body of soccer. It was reported in 2017 that KPMG had the highest number of deficiencies, among the Big Four, cited by its regulator in the previous two years.\n\nIn 2017, KPMG paid a $6.2 million fine to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for inadequacies in its audit of the financial statements of oil and gas company, Miller Energy Resources.\n\nIn November 2017, 91 partners of KPMG faced contempt proceedings in Hong Kong High Court, as China Medical Technologies (CMED) liquidators investigating a $400 million fraud took action against KPMG with regard to its refusal honor a February 2016 court order to produce Chinese working papers, correspondence, and records to the liquidators. The liquidators are asking that 91 defendants be held in contempt of court, which could result in criminal penalties, or weekly fines. KPMG had issued written audit reports for CMED from 2003 to 2008, and was replaced by PwC Zhong Tian in August 2009. \"Perhaps locking up 91 KPMG partners over Christmas may spur the firms to find a solution to this problem\", said Professor Paul Gillis of Peking University's Guanghua School of Management.\n\nIn November 2018, the Sultanate of Oman's Capital Market Authority (CMA) suspended KPMG from auditing entities regulated by the CMA for a period of one year after discovering major financial and accounting irregularities in the entities' records.\n\nIn January 2018 it was announced that KPMG, auditor of collapsed UK construction firm Carillion, would have its role examined by the Financial Reporting Council, and it was summoned to give evidence before two House of Commons select committees on 22 February 2018.\n\nOn 13 February 2018, the 'Big 4' accountancy firms, including KPMG, were described by MP Frank Field as \"feasting on what was soon to become a carcass\" after collecting fees of £72m for Carillion work during the years leading up to its collapse. KPMG was singled out for particular criticism for signing off Carillion's last accounts before a profit warning in July 2017: \"Either KPMG failed to spot the warning signs, or its judgement was clouded by its cosy relationship with the company and the multimillion-pound fees it received,\" said MP Rachel Reeves. Two out of three former Carillion finance directors had also worked for KPMG.\n\nKPMG defended itself, saying that in the construction industry \"an accumulation of adverse events [...] can quite quickly cause a precipitous decline.\" KPMG chairman and senior partner Bill Michael said: \"It does not follow automatically from a company collapse either that the opinion of management was wrong, or that the auditor did a bad job.\"\n\nOn 22 February 2018, MPs contested evidence from KPMG (in one exchange MP Peter Kyle told KPMG partner Peter Meehan: \"I would not hire you to do an audit of the contents of my fridge\"). Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, said:\n\nAuditing is a multi-million-pound business for the Big Four. On this morning's evidence from KPMG and Deloitte, these audits appear to be a colossal waste of time and money, fit only to provide false assurance to investors, workers and the public. [...] Carillion staff and investors could see the problems at the company but those responsible - auditors, regulators, and, ultimately, the directors – did nothing to stop Carillion being driven off a cliff.\n\nThe final report of the Parliamentary inquiry into Carillion's collapse, published on 16 May 2018, criticised KPMG for its \"complicity\" in the company's financial reporting practices:\n\nKPMG audited Carillion for 19 years, pocketing £29 million in the process. Not once during that time did they qualify their audit opinion on the financial statements, instead signing off the figures put in front of them by the company's directors. Yet, had KPMG been prepared to challenge management, the warning signs were there in highly questionable assumptions about construction contract revenue and the intangible asset of goodwill accumulated in historic acquisitions. These assumptions were fundamental to the picture of corporate health presented in audited annual accounts. In failing to exercise—and voice—professional scepticism towards Carillion's aggressive accounting judgements, KPMG was complicit in them. It should take its own share of responsibility for the consequences.\n\nThe select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for a complete overhaul of Britain's corporate governance regime, saying the government had \"lacked the decisiveness or bravery\" to do so, accused the big four accounting firms of operating as a \"cosy club\", with KPMG singled out for its \"complicity\" in signing off Carillion's \"increasingly fantastical figures\".\n\nKPMG said:\nWe believe we conducted our audit appropriately. However, it's only right that following a corporate collapse of such size and significance, the necessary investigations are performed. Auditing large and complex businesses involves many judgments and we will continue to cooperate with the FRC's ongoing investigation. ... We welcome any future review of our profession. If we consider how the profession has changed in the last decade […] it is clear there is a need for us to look closely at our business models.\n\nIn a June 2018 report on audit standards across eight accounting firms, the FRC identified \"failure to challenge management and show appropriate scepticism across their audits.\" It highlighted a decline in the quality of work undertaken by the Big Four, with KPMG performing the worst. There had, the FRC said, been an \"unacceptable deterioration\" in the quality of KPMG's work, and the FRC would scrutinise KPMG more closely as a result. In October 2018, the FRC proposed reforms to tackle the \"underlying falling trust in business and the effectiveness of audit,\" and severely rebuked KPMG.\n\nIn November 2018, KPMG said it would no longer undertake consultancy work for FTSE 350 Index-listed companies if it was also auditing them, in an effort to \"remove even the perception of a possible conflict\" of interest.\n\nThe Carillion investigation followed FRC investigations into KPMG's role at HBOS, Quindell and The Co-operative Bank. In July 2018, the FRC started an investigation into KPMG's audit role at collapsed drinks merchant Conviviality.\n\nIn 2017, KPMG was embroiled in related scandals involving the Gupta family. KPMG, whose history in South Africa dated back to 1895, and which had been part of the international organization since its founding in 1979, faced calls for closure, and an uncertain future, as a consequence of the damage done to the South African economy as a result of its activities.\n\nKPMG had been working with a Gupta family company in the mining sector, Oakbay Resources and Energy, for 15 years prior to the revelations of corruption and collusion in 2016, at which point KPMG resigned. The full impact and financial profit that KPMG received is yet to be determined; however, at least one large company has terminated its services with KPMG due to its relationship with Oakbay.\n\nIn July 2017, after controversial documents were leaked by the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, former chief executive of KPMG South Africa and the former partner that was responsible for audits related to the Gupta family, Moses Kgosana, withdrew from becoming the chairman of Alexander Forbes, a financial services firm.\n\nIn 2015, KPMG issued a controversial report that implicated former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in the creation of an illegal intelligence gathering unit of the South African Revenue Service (SARS). This report was seen by elements of the media to be part of a wider Gupta-linked state capture conspiracy, with the aim of forcing Gordhan out of his post. The report was withdrawn by KPMG in September 2017, earning the ire of the Commissioner of SARS, Tom Moyane.\n\nAfter an internal investigation that found work done for the Gupta family fell \"considerably short\" of the firm's standards and amid rising political and public backlash, KPMG's senior leadership in South Africa, including its chairman Ahmed Jaffer, CEO Trevor Hoole, COO Steven Louw, and five partners, resigned in September 2017.\n\nSave South Africa, a civil-society group, accused KPMG and UK PR firm Bell Pottinger of playing a \"central role in facilitating state capture.\" Numerous South African companies either fired KPMG in the immediate aftermath of the scandal, or were reconsidering their relationships with the firm with the international chairman of KPMG, John Veihmeyer, apologising for the conduct of the South African arm and the firm pledged to donate fees earned from Gupta businesses, as well as the withdrawn SARS report to anti-corruption activities.\n\nThe Swedish member firm was main sponsor for Swedish biathlete Magdalena Forsberg, six-time world champion and two-time Olympic medalist. Forsberg was working as a tax consultant at the KPMG Sundsvall office parallel to her athletic career.\n\nIn February 2008, Phil Mickelson, ranked one of the best golfers in the world, signed a three-year global sponsorship deal with KPMG. As part of the agreement, Mickelson was to wear the KPMG logo on his headwear during all golf related appearances.\n\nThe Canadian member firm sponsored skier Alexandre Bilodeau, who won the first gold medal for Canada on home soil in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Alexandre's father is a tax partner in the Montreal office.\n\nKPMG and McLaren Technology Group have formed a strategic alliance to apply McLaren Applied Technologies' (MAT) predictive analytics and technology to KPMG's audit and advisory services. McLaren 2015 Formula 1 car has the KPMG logo engraved above the pilot seat.\n\nSince 2016, KPMG has been strategic sponsor of Brain Bar, a Budapest-based, annually held festival on the future. \n\nKPMG ranked in the top 2 overall in Consultancy Rankings 2009 by OpRisk & Compliance – in recognition of KPMG's experience in risk management.\n\nIn 2011, the company was ranked second on the World's Best Outsourcing Advisors – in recognition of the firm's depth of experience, global reach and holistic approach. That same year, the company was inducted into Working Mother Hall of Fame after being honored for 15 years as one of Working Mother magazine's 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers. KPMG was ranked number 13 in \"Consulting Magazine\"'s Best Firms to Work for in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, KPMG was ranked 29th on \"Fortune\" list of 100 best companies to work for. That same year, KPMG, along with PwC, Deloitte, and PA Consulting Group, were among the UK's 25 top companies to work for.\n\n"}

{"id": "19425421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19425421", "title": "Léon Gallet", "text": "Léon Gallet\n\nLéon L. Gallet (1832–1899), watchmaker, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and past family patriarch of the Gallet Watch Company of Switzerland, is considered as one of the primary architects and founders of the 19th century industrialization of the Swiss watchmaking industry.\n\nThe son of Julien Gallet (1806–1849), who moved the family watchmaking business from Geneva, Switzerland, to the manufacturing district of La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1826, Léon L. Gallet was responsible for the creation of numerous Swiss and American watch brands. Among these was the prestigious Fabrique Electa, which became the upscale line of the jewelry department at Macy’s Department store in New York City during the first quarter of the 20th century. Léon L. Gallet also established the brands National Park, Continental Watch Company, Jerome Park, Bridgeport, Eureka, Commodore, Union Square, and Lady Racine. While the appearance and function of many of Gallet’s timepieces were tailored to the tastes of the American consumers, all of the movements in these watches were manufactured in Switzerland.\n\nLéon Gallet played a philanthropic role in the business, cultural, and social life of his native home. As well as his prominent position as a member of both the legislature of Neuchâtel and the Council of La Chaux-de-Fonds, he was for many years, the president of the Société des Amis des Arts (Fine Arts Society) and Grand Master of the Free Masons. Together with Louis & Jules Courvoisier, Ernest Francillon of Longines, and Constant Girard-Perregaux, Léon Gallet founded the Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society for the Industries of the Jura Area) in 1876. The purpose of this organization was to assist in the promotion and distribution of products from Switzerland's Watch Valley while addressing the growing threat of competition in European markets from American watch manufacturers.\n\nUpon his death in 1899, Léon Gallet bequeathed a sum of 43,000 Swiss Francs (today equivalent to 1,000,000 Swiss Francs or approx. 1,000,000 US dollars) to his hometown of La Chaux-de-Fonds, of which 25,000 Swiss Francs were earmarked to build the Musée International d'Horlogerie (International Watch Making Museum). Donated by Léon Gallet’s son Georges, the museum’s collection was started with a body of over 100 of Gallet's most complicated and valuable timepieces, including the world's first wristwatch produced for mass consumption in 1892. The balance of the bequeathed funds was used to construct the Musée des beaux-arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds (Beaux Arts Museum of La-Chaux-de-Fonds), designed by renowned painter Charles l’Eplattenier and architect René Chapallaz, Le Corbusier's architecture teacher.\n\nPrior to his passing, Léon Gallet commissioned René Chapallaz, to design \"Villa Gallet\". Situated in \"Parc Gallet\" in the southern part of La Chaux-de-Fonds, \"Villa Gallet\" still retains its original name and is considered as an important historic contribution to the Swiss Art Nouveau movement of the late 19th century.\n\nAny study of the 19th century industrialization of Switzerland’s “Watch Valley” is not complete without mentioning the role of watchmaker and entrepreneur, Léon L. Gallet.\n\nIn the years following America’s Civil War, a powerful shift of that country’s concentration moved from agriculture to industry. With this shift came great advancements in manufacturing as centrally located factories replaced small workshops, and large scale production of items with interchangeable parts quickly displaced less efficient hand-crafting. An immediate beneficiary of this progress was America’s watch and clock industry, as northern coal powered factories began turning out hundreds of high quality timepieces per day. On the horizon for these newly empowered companies was the inevitable expansion beyond domestic borders to embark in direct competition with the Swiss watchmaking industry.\n\nLéon L. Gallet and Ernest Francillon of Longines, two Swiss watchmakers who were actively selling their wares in North America, saw the writing on the wall. Recognizing the only way that the small workshops of Switzerland’s “Watch Valley” could compete against the growing threat posed by larger American manufacturers was to unite. At the prompting of Gallet and Francillon, a new organization was created. The Société Intercantonale des Industries du Jura (Intercantonal Society of the Jura Industries) was formed to bring together the individual strengths of the region’s numerous independent watchmaking houses as a powerful cooperative entity.\n\nYet, in spite of the formation of this new organization, the warnings of Gallet and Francillon were met with skepticism by the other members of the group. Decades of success as the world’s primary supplier of fine timepieces had resulted in a self-assured complacency within Switzerland’s watchmaking industry.\n\nThen on the 10th of May, 1876, the great Philadelphia International Exhibition, created to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of America’s Declaration of Independence, opened to the public. Among the many displays was the indisputable evidence of the manufacturing superiority of such American companies as Waltham and Elgin, each capable of finishing many hundred watches per day.\n\nJacques David, Swiss watchmaker and machine designer, was dispatched to America by Ernest Francillon to witness the exhibitions first-hand, and report his findings back to the Intercanonal Society. Léon L. Gallet followed shortly behind, arriving in Philadelphia the next month. What both men witnessed at the exhibition further confirmed the concerns of Gallet and Francillon.\n\nOn his return to Switzerland in November, Jacques David wrote a long detailed report on the mens' findings to the Intercantonal Society of the Jura Industries. While David’s report helped to wake the Swiss watchmaking industry from its comfortable complacency, increased revenues were needed for the Society’s members to initiate the developments required to meet these new challenges.\n\nBy the time that the Philadelphia Exposition opened to the public in 1876, Léon L. Gallet had already established sales offices in both New York City and Chicago, going back over ten years. He had personally suffered a number of long ocean voyages to deliver his wares and to conduct business. Besides his acute knowledge of the growing threat posed by worldwide competition from US manufactures, Gallet understood the tastes of the American consumer and the opportunities the new world also held for the Jura watchmakers.\n\nWith the now available joint resources from fellow manufacturing members of the Intercantonal Society, Gallet decided to take the competitive battle directly to the enemy. Not only could the rapidly expanding base of American consumers provide opportunities for increased sales of Swiss watches, these sales could provide the needed revenues to meet the expected competitive challenges in Europe.\n\nUtilizing his own movements, as well as components by such friends as Auguste Agassiz, Ernest Francillon, Constant Girard-Perregaux, Jules Jeanneret, and Louis and Jules Courvoisier, Gallet began production of 30 new watch brands, most designed specifically to appeal to the taste of the America consumer.\n\nWithin a short period, exports of Swiss watches to America rapidly increased, greatly expanding the reach of watchmakers whose previous market was limited only to the local economies. As a result, Leon L. Gallet’s American marketing activities helped to provide the needed capital for the watchmakers of the Jura region to industrialize, and successfully meet one of the greatest challenges in Swiss timekeeping’s history.\n\n"}

She holds a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Niš.\n\nThe Karić family was one of the richest in Serbia during the 1990s. More recent reports suggest that their wealth and influence, though reduced, remain significant. Milanka Karić has been active in several of the family's business and philanthropic concerns, including serving as president of the Karić Foundation.\n\nKarić ran as the Strength of Serbia Movement's candidate for president of Serbia in the 2008 election, when her husband was outside the country to avoid criminal prosecution.

He was the son of Oakes Ames (1804–1873), a railroad baron behind the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) who was notably censured in the Credit Mobilier scandal for actions taken while a United States Congressman. Ames was executor of his father's estate, and took over many of his business interests. A Republican, he served as the 35th Governor of Massachusetts (1887–1890). He was a major philanthropist, especially in his hometown of Easton, which is graced by a number of architecturally significant works by H.H. Richardson as a result of his influence.\n\nOliver Ames was born in North Easton, Massachusetts on February 4, 1831, to Oakes Ames and Eveline Orville (Gilmore) Ames. His father was the owner of a shovel factory, which became the largest such business in the country. Ames was educated in the local schools, and then attended private academies in North Attleborough and Leicester. He was briefly employed in the family's factory before enrolling in Brown University in 1851. He spent three years there, in a custom-designed program overseen by university president Francis Wayland.\n\nAmes then entered the family business, where he learned all aspects of its manufacturing processes and worked as a traveling salesman. When his grandfather Oliver died in 1863, he became a partner in the business. During the American Civil War, he oversaw the manufacturing department, introducing efficiencies in the manufacturing processes and expanding the business. During these years his grandfather, uncle, and father, in addition to expanding the shovel business, invested in railroads and other industrial concerns.\nAmes' father and uncle (also named Oliver) were leading figures in the Union Pacific, as well as principals in Crédit Mobilier of America, a corporation established by Union Pacific insiders to siphon profits from the railroad construction. Oakes Ames, while a member of Congress in the 1860s, sold shares of Crédit Mobiler to other Congressmen, priced at par value, which was well below their estimated market value. When this was exposed in 1872, it was determined by a Congressional investigating committee to be for the purpose of influencing railroad-related legislation. The scandal resulted in his censure, and he died not long afterward. Ames became co-executor and heir to his father's fortune, which included a nationwide network of business interests, as well as $6–8 million in debts, most of them related to the Union Pacific and Crédit Mobilier scandal. Over a period of years, Ames was able to pay off the debts, provide more than $1 million in bequests, and divide the estate amongst the heirs.\nAmes's relationship with the Union Pacific (UP) took years of legal action to unwind. In 1875, financier Jay Gould obtained control of the UP, while a group of mainly Ames-dominated Boston investors retained control of Crédit Mobilier (CM). The latter company was mired in legal action related to the scandal, and its shares were a major component of Oakes Ames's estate. The company's only major asset was a $2 million note against UP, and Ames instigated legal action by CM to recover its value. Gould and UP countersued, offering CM shareholders equivalent UP stock in a bid to gain control over CM. This gambit largely succeeded, with most CM shareholders, including Ames's uncle, agreeing to the deal. Ames rejected the deal, and became the principal opponent to Gould's later actions. Gould successfully ousted Ames from the CM board, which (under Gould's control) then voted to discontinue its lawsuit. Ames launched legal action as a shareholder, and succeeded in forcing CM into receivership in 1879, with himself as the receiver. The legal wrangling continued until 1880, with most of the holdout shareholders eventually being bought out by Gould for $20/share plus costs.\n\nDuring the legal wrangling over the UP, Ames scored a significant business coup with Gould. In the 1860s, Ames acquired (for a low price) a controlling interest in the Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad, a paper railroad, separate from the UP, which was chartered to provided service in Kansas. In the late 1870s, he personally oversaw the acquisition of rights of way and construction of the railroad. He sold it to Gould, who was assembling pieces of a full transcontinental rail network under the UP umbrella, for $250/share.\n\nAmes entered public life with the stated intent to vindicate his father's memory. His early political activities included sitting on Easton's School Committee, and chairing the local Republican Party committee. He decided to run for state senate in 1879, after he was unsuccessful in securing passage for the separation of the Martha's Vineyard community of Cottage City, where he owned a summer house, from Edgartown. Winning election, he saw through the incorporation of the town (now known as Oak Bluffs). He also sat on the committees overseeing railroads and schools.\n\nIn 1882, Ames received the Republican nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, alongside gubernatorial nominee Senate President Robert R. Bishop. In a bitterly divisive contest dominated by issues of corruption at the national level, and temperance at the local level, Democrat Benjamin Butler defeated Bishop, but Ames won his race. Ames served from 1883 to 1886, first under Butler (for one term) and then George D. Robinson (for three). In 1883, the Massachusetts legislature passed a resolution exonerating his father, and called on Congress to reverse the censure. During this period he also oversaw the sale by the state of its interests in the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the Hoosac Tunnel. He was at first criticized for the relatively low price (shares were sold at 1/3 of par value), but it was later seen to be a good deal.\n\nWith Governor Robinson retiring in 1886, Ames won election as Governor of Massachusetts, and served three lackluster one-year terms. One of the major political issues in his first two races was his lack of service in the American Civil War. Ames had served in the state militia before the war, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel, but resigned before the war began. Ames countered criticisms by pointing out that he had hired a substitute to serve in his place, and that he had financially supported the Union war effort.\nAs governor, Ames was a competent administrator, hiring and promoting more on the basis of merit than politics. He advocated the improvement of public schools, as a counter to private religious schools. In his second term, he donated $1,000 to the College of the Holy Cross, which upset anti-Catholics in the state and cost him votes in the third election against William E. Russell. He was also unpopular with advocates of temperance; although he supported the work of the Massachusetts Temperance Society, he was opposed to the legislated prohibition of alcohol. A state constitutional amendment enacting prohibition was passed by the legislature in 1889, but was voted down in the required referendum that followed. A project to expand the Massachusetts State House was approved during his tenure, and he in 1889 helped lay the cornerstone for its new elements. In 1887 he signed a bill exempting military veterns from recently enacted civil service regulations, earning him the ire of the state's progressives.\n\nIn 1888, his health began to fail, probably due to the strain of office and his business interests. He refused to run for reelection in 1889, continuing a party tradition of three-term governors. After leaving office, he traveled to Europe several times to relax and recover his health. He died at his North Easton home in 1895.\n\nAmes married Anna Coffin Ray of Nantucket in 1860. The couple had six children; Oakes Ames (1874–1950), their youngest son, was a well-known American botanist and orchid expert. He owned palatial properties in Boston, Martha's Vineyard, and North Easton.\n\nAmes was elected an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1917, by the fraternity's Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory in Boston. He is the only known member to receive such a posthumous offer.\n\nEaston's public high school (of which he was a major financial backer) is named Oliver Ames High School in his honor. He is also the namesake of the small community of Oliver, Nebraska, and of the schooner \"Governor Ames\", one of largest wooden sailing vessels built in the 19th century, and the first oceangoing five-masted schooner on the Atlantic coast (Ames was one the investors in the ship).\n\nTogether with his cousin Frederick Lothrop Ames, Oliver financed many important buildings and landscapes in North Easton designed by architect H. H. Richardson and landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted. Notable among these are Oakes Ames Memorial Hall and the Ames Free Library, centerpieces of the H. H. Richardson Historic District of North Easton, a National Historic Landmark District. He was also a patron of sports and the arts, owning Booth's Theatre in New York City, and raising funds to send athletes from the Boston Athletic Association to the 1896 Summer Olympics.\n\n"}

{"id": "22833539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22833539", "title": "Revenue assurance", "text": "Revenue assurance\n\nRevenue assurance (RA) is a niche business activity most commonly undertaken within businesses that provide telecommunication services.\nThe activity is the use of data quality and process improvement methods that improve profits, revenues and cash flows without influencing demand. This was defined by a TM Forum working group based on research documented in its Revenue Assurance Technical Overview .\nIn many telecommunications service providers, revenue assurance is led by a dedicated revenue assurance department.\n\n\"Revenue assurance\" is a broad umbrella term. It is used both to describe an activity performed within telecommunications service providers, and is a common name for a small business unit associated with that activity. Revenue assurance is a practical response to perceived or actual issues with operational under performance, most commonly relating to billing and collection of revenue. Some of the procedures associated with identifying, remedying or preventing errors may be undertaken by a dedicated Revenue Assurance department, though responsibility for revenue assurance is often diffuse and varies greatly with the organizational structure of the provider. Assuming a provider with a typical organizational split, responsibilities for revenue assurance primarily sit between the Finance and Technology directorates, however, revenue assurance initiatives are often started in a business unit or marketing group.\n\nThe relevance to Finance rests with the responsibility for financial control, audit and reporting, while the subject matter would be network and IS systems as implemented or operated by the Technology side of the business. Marketing groups and / or business units (e.g. wholesale or retail business lines) will often embark on revenue assurance projects in an effort to improve product line margins. Furthermore, marketing and business units are pivotal in providing input into the \"should be\" state of customer bills and products.\n\nThe sphere of influence described by revenue assurance varies greatly between telecommunications service providers, but is usually closely related to back office functions where small errors may have a disproportionately large impact on revenues or costs. The processing of transaction data in modern telecommunications providers exhibits many attributes akin to a complex system. However, there is significant disagreement about the ultimate aims and legitimate scope of revenue assurance teams. This is in part caused by:\n\n(1) the cross-functional nature of the activity and the consequent need for a variety of skills from IT, marketing, finance, et al.;\n\n(2) the difficulty of generalizing across businesses with different objectives and business models;\n\n(3) political infighting within each telco about responsibility for revenue leakages and assurance; and\n\n(4) the difficulty in reliably measuring the value added by revenue assurance as separable from underlying performance.\n\nThere is high-level agreement between practitioners about the goals and methods of revenue assurance, though reaching a consensus on defining the boundaries of revenue assurance has proved elusive so far. The goals relate to improving the financial performance by eliminating mistakes in the processing of transaction data. Some take a more encompassing view of what counts as a mistake, which may extend as far as questioning the policy set by executives even when this has been executed correctly. Others take a more open-ended view of the data that is the subject matter. For example, in decreasing order of frequency, revenue assurance may cover:\n\n(1) revenues from retail and corporate sales;\n\n(2) revenues and costs from interconnect and wholesale contracts; and\n\n(3) margins and profitability of investment in networks and information systems.\n\nOther markets have different or more refined priorities. For example, in the U.S.A. management of wholesale contracts has often been the first objective because of the complexity of the domestic market resulting from the Federal Communications Commission's regulatory framework. In contrast, telcos in developing countries may prioritize management of international interconnect arrangements because of the risks posed by fraud and arbitrage. A cable supplier or internet service provider that predominantly offers retail customers flat monthly charges and no limits on usage may be most interested in assuring the profitability of network investments.\n\nRevenue assurance is often regarded by practitioners as a low-cost mechanism to generate significant financial returns for telecommunications service providers. However, the returns are unpredictable as well as being hard to measure, which encourages many executives to take a sceptical view of its worth. Comparable revenue assurance activities do occur in other industries, such as with billing of utilities or with the licensing of software, and there are many parallels with financial and operational control activities undertaken by most large businesses. The rationale for why revenue assurance has come to be considered particularly important in telecommunications, unlike other industries, is disputed. Reasonable conjectures are that:\n\n(1) the fast pace of change and intense commercial competition increase the likelihood of mistakes;\n\n(2) there is significant complexity in determining the combined effect of interacting systems and processes; and\n\n(3) the high-volume, low-value nature of transactions amplifies the financial implications of \"small\" errors.\n\nAnother conjecture is that revenue assurance is a response to changing market conditions. The thinking is that as markets reach saturation and growth potential falls off, so the value of maximizing returns from existing sales increases. This observation has some merit but does not explain the increasing popularity of revenue assurance in telcos serving growth markets. It also in part contradicts the assumption of a compelling costs versus benefits argument for revenue assurance, which would be enhanced in businesses undergoing rapid change. It is also important to recognize that there is a long history of revenue assurance activities in some telcos that predates the coining of the term \"revenue assurance\".\n\nThe revenue assurance techniques applied in practice cover a broad spectrum, from analysis and implementation of business controls to automated data interrogation. At one end of the spectrum, revenue assurance can appear very similar to the kinds of review and process mapping techniques applied for other financial controlling objectives like accounting integrity, as exemplified by those derived from clause 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This form of revenue assurance is most commonly promoted by consultancies. The size of such consultancies covers the entire range; the Big 4 all offer some form of revenue assurance consulting, but there are also niche specialist consultancies. At the other end of the spectrum, revenue assurance is treated as a form of reactive automated data interrogation, seeking to find anomalies in transaction data that may indicate errors and potential revenue loss. This form of revenue assurance is most commonly promoted by software houses that aim to provide databases and configurable tools to extract and interrogate a telco's source data. A less popular form of reactive automated assurance involves using both software and specialised hardware as a means of extracting additional data on transactions, for example by creating actual network events or interfacing directly with network elements to replicate dummy events. As with consultancies, IT-oriented revenue assurance solutions are offered by both large vendors like providers of billing and mediation software, and by specialized niche providers.\n\nThere is some debate about the relative merits of the different techniques that can be employed in revenue assurance.\n\nAs yet, there is no professional body, no qualifications, and no academic research that would help to drive consensus about the purpose or methods of revenue assurance. In part this is addressed by individuals working in the sector through membership and qualification in related fields such as accountancy and information systems audit. Some scientific research in other fields is also applicable to revenue assurance, though most revenue assurance \"facts\" rely heavily on anecdotes and oft-repeated truisms. Some of the most helpful and progressive initiatives in addressing the problem of consensus and scientific basis are listed below.\n\nRevenue assurance is usually understood as a means to identify and remedy, and perhaps also to prevent, problems that result in financial under performance without seeking to generate additional sales. The most common metaphor is that of leaking water from a pipe, where water stands in place of revenues or cash flows, and the leaks represent waste. The value of revenue assurance is hence determined by the size of the leaks \"plugged\", and possibly also those leaks prevented before they occur, although estimating the value of the latter is very problematic. The value added also includes the recovery of \"lost\" revenues or costs (through issuing additional bills, chasing uncollected payments, renegotiating with suppliers a refund of costs etc.) after the fact. This last form of reactive revenue assurance is the easiest to put a value to, but is in many ways the least efficient form of revenue assurance; effort is directed towards repeatedly addressing the consequences of known flaws, and not on addressing the flaws themselves. This can lead to a parasitical relationship between a Revenue Assurance department or vendor and the wider business, where the department/vendor finds it easiest to justify its ongoing existence/contract by repeatedly fixing symptoms and not the root causes.\n\nThe TM Forum conducted a benchmark survey in 2008 that concluded average leakage, not including losses due to fraud, was 1% of the gross revenues for those telcos that took part. The number of participating telcos was relatively small compared to some other surveys, but the survey technique was more demanding than any comparable survey to date. The survey used the most detailed and prescriptive definition of how to calculate leakage of any survey of its type. The definition was taken from the TM Forum's own standard on how to calculate revenue assurance metrics . To increase confidence that participants calculated their leakages correctly, the TM Forum's benchmark program independently reviewed the results and corroborated them with representatives of the participating companies. The survey's average of 1% leakage of gross revenue, whilst still significant, is notably lower than many other quoted estimates and reported survey findings about average leakage. This may be because the survey used a very strict definition of leakage. The survey measured only actual under-billed and unbilled amounts discovered by the participants; it excluded other types of leakages such as cost leakages and loss of opportunity leakages, and it excluded projected leakage estimations that are commonly used (i.e., what would have been the amount of leakage, if the leakage would not been discovered by revenue assurance activities). It may also reflect a reduction in bias or exaggeration in reported leakages, or at least the exclusion of guesswork. Respondents were given authoritative instructions on how to quantify leakage based on actual data and were instructed to avoid making suppositions in the absence of such data.\n\nThe best known estimates of \"typical\" revenue leakage come from a series of annual surveys conducted by the Analysys consultancy and research business. In these surveys, leakage was commonly estimated as being worth between 5% and 15% of the total revenue of the business. Similar research by other businesses has generated results in the same range, with none concluding leakage of less than 1% of gross revenue, and some suggesting leakage of 20% or more was not uncommon. Reasons to doubt these estimates are as follows:\n\n(1) All the estimates of leakage were derived from the subjective opinions of staff working in service providers;\n\n(2) All the research was conducted by businesses wishing to promote their revenue assurance products;\n\n(3) Increased annual spend on revenue assurance has not resulted in a clear downward trend in estimates;\n\n(4) The estimates were broadly similar even when the criteria for what losses to include varied greatly; and\n\n(5) Genuine losses of this scale should be a severe corporate governance issue in any publicly listed business.\n\nWhat can be said with some confidence is that revenue assurance practitioners are able to provide a vast number of consistent anecdotes relating to the causes of leakage and means to resolve them. Though there is little objective evidence relating to actual leakages approaching this scale in the public domain as this information per se is highly confidential, there are some indirect measures of data integrity that help give a sense of potential leakage. For example, in reconciling interconnect costs and revenues between telcos, a 5% variance is the common practice to accept before a disputed invoice can lead one party to withhold payment, and a 0.5% variance would be considered industry-leading practice according to best practice advice issued by the UK Revenue Assurance Group.\n\nAlthough Revenue Assurance has always been present in the telecom parlance it has recently been brought at the forefront of the top management. This is due to several factors including\nRevenue Assurance has been a problem for the telecom companies since the very early stages. Tracking of pulses, minutes, counts, bytes etc. has never been more difficult. One would think these would be easy for the tech-savvy telco companies. However, the truth has been just the opposite. In a hurry to release new technologies in the market, the Revenue Assurance systems are always lagging behind. Revenue Assurance in a telco environment covers a wide range of technical and business aspects. An RA operator needs to be aware of both OSS & BSS processes and internal dependencies to accurately decipher the revenue code.\n\nA telecom organization's revenue chain is usually a very complex set of inter-related technologies and processes providing a seamless set of services to the end consumer. As the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each of its connections. A revenue leakage is typically attributed to when a telco organization is unable to bill correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment. As the organization grows the probability of revenue leakage only increases.\n\nThe most debated part of revenue assurance is where to start checking, i.e. at the network side, the rating side, the billing side, the interconnect side, the CRM side, etc. However, most surveys and reports state that the maximum leakage happens during the flow of Call Detail Records (CDRs) or Event Detail Records (EDRs) from the Switch to the respective rating / billing engines. Some of the common problem areas are : \n * Signaling problems\n * Incorrect Rejection Logic\n\nAmong the disciplines in revenue assurance are:\n\n1. The CORE functions of a revenue assurance group: Monitoring, Baselining, Auditing, Synchronizing, Investigating and Compliance.\n2. Decomposing an organization's revenue assurance scope (The Revenue Management Chain).\n3. Assessing and minimizing revenue loss risk.\n\nThere is no formal maturity model for Revenue Assurance which is universally accepted. However the Revenue Assurance processes can be pegged against a generic five stage maturity model. The five stages are listed below and are described in terms of a Revenue Assurance Strategy, People, Process and technological advances.\n\n\nThe Revenue Assurance processes in many ways can be regarded as an auditing process. The objective is to ensure that policies of the organization are well implemented and that no or minimal revenue leakage is occurring. The RA processes have the capability to cover all departments and service lines in a telecommunications organization. There are many ways in which RA processes can be classified, however in view of an audit function; the RA processes can be categorized into Detective, Corrective and Preventive activities, controls or processes. Let's understand the difference with the help of an example. Supposing the objective is to ensure trunk groups correctly entered in the MSCs. The detective control would be to monitor Trunk Groups appearing in CDRs are harmonized with the master list and any deviations are reported. The corrective control would be to initiative a process and confirm with the Network / Wholesale team of all deviations found. The preventive control would be to set up a process with the Network / Wholesale team where all new trunk groups are first informed to the RA, Mediation, Wholesale and other essential departments and then made live on the Network.\n\nRevenue Assurance Detection is the process of spotting a change in value of a dimension relative to its movement from System A to System B or within a given systems itself. The change in the value is relative to a dimension is question. Detection in RA can be achieved by both manual and automated means. Typical detection activities include monitoring, summarization, investigation and auditing.\n\nCorrection is the set of activities and processes related around getting the process structures correct in order to minimize the changes identified as per the detection techniques. Correction itself is the act or method of correcting a discrepancy. Typically some information, configuration, amount or quantity needs to be added, edited or removed from a system, process or procedure in order to correct the anomaly. In Revenue Assurance activities, the process of correction of a root cause could involve correction of information, processes, technology or people. \nTelecom Network technologies evolve at a rapid pace. Sometimes technologies need to be balanced in the Network. For example, having multiple vendors on the Network side could lead to a requirement of having time synchronizer equipment installed just to have CDRs showing consistent time and date related information. \nAny current implementation of Revenue Assurance becomes obsolete rapidly. As technologies evolve revenue assurance tools and coverage of the tools also need to evolve. This essentially means technology corrections need to be performed either on the hardware side or on the tool / application side. Technology corrections are rare and need to be performed with due diligence as technology corrections can be very expensive to an organization.\n\nPrevention is the process of performing an activity in order to avoid a high risk situation. It is essentially an action carried out to de-risk a threat. For example, if there is risk that a tariff plan is not correctly implemented, then the preventive action could be to simulate calls on test SIMs on the new tariff plans prior to launch and confirm the tariffs coming in the test CDRs against the marketing or advertising department rates. Preventive activities lead to effective risk management around Revenue Assurance. \n\nSince Revenue Assurance is a very niche area in the telecommunications environment, there are some specific products and solutions supporting this subject. There are various vendors in the market which address either the complete suite of Revenue Assurance requirements or specialize in the specific domains. This section describes the basic features of a generic Revenue Assurance tool.\n\nOne must keep in mind that software RA solutions can only help in pointing toward the error locations or problem areas. When one addresses the question of developing an RA solution they need to consider the magnitude, scope and capacity of the systems available along with the intellect, skills, and the number of people accessible. Finally it is the people, their skills and knowledge that make a complete RA solution. An organization should be careful when automating revenue assurance as it may end up with an expensive and inflexible solution which no one can manage effectively.\nThere are a variety of specialized RA products which have different characteristics including probing, RA add on modules on respective OSS / BSS elements. However the most common tool adopted by most Telecommunication companies is one which can simulate the natural process of the CDR flow from Network generation to Invoicing. Given below are some of the requirements (not exhaustive) of such a Revenue Assurance product.\n\nTelecommunications is an environment where there are many heterogeneous systems creating a multitude of data. Typically a single day’s information runs into many Giga Bytes or in some cases Tera Bytes also. This creates a need to have very proficient and rigorous extraction, transformation and loading tool for a Revenue Assurance application. Some of the common features of this tool are:\n\n\nOne of the primary focus areas of a Revenue Assurance tool is to compare CDRs or XDRs from 2 different sources and checking if all the records from the first system have transferred properly to the second system keeping the appropriate business rules in consideration. This is achieved via comparative analysis of the records between the 2 systems either at the details record level or summary level by evaluating the common dimensions between the 2 data sets. Given below are some of the requirements (not exhaustive) which a Revenue Assurance Reconciliation side of the product should provide. \n\n\nOnce all the information has been received into the Revenue Assurance systems it time to crunch numbers and generate reports. The critical part is the analytical capabilities of the tool. The tool needs to have the ability to make sense of the problems in the vast set of data that it has gathered. This can only be done by a high performance analytical engine which should be capable of the following activities (non exhaustive):\n\n\nA Revenue Assurance dashboard is an easy to read, often single page, real-time user interface, showing a graphical presentation of the current status (snapshot) and historical trends of an organization’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to enable instantaneous and informed decisions to be made at a glance. For example, a prepaid dashboard may show KPIs related to prepaid CDRs reconciliation, prepaid user profile reconciliation, balance reconciliations and voucher reconciliations carried out in real time or near real time.\n\n\nA case management capability in Revenue Assurance should be able to provide a 360 degree view of a given case. The tool should be able to track and resolve the identified discrepancies. The tool should handle each “case” in the system from the point where the system detected it, and manage follow up through the correction and reclamation processes, until the case is resolved. Based on a discrepancy in one given area, It should be able connect relevant information from various sources. For example, if a CDRs reconciliation has a problem, the case tool should be able to co-relate with respective user profiles, non-usage information, credits risks, network configurations etc. The case management component may have some of the following non exhaustive capabilities:\n\n"}

On 4 May 1928 they wrote a letter to the government, complaining that the state semi-monopoly Vinmonopolet disfavorized their father's wine importing agency Dysthe & Co. A scrutiny commission was set up to review Vinmonopolet's business practice. Vinmonopolet, on the other hand, sued the Dysthe brothers to have the complaints declared null and void, but a year later, in April 1930, Vinmonopolet lost the legal case. The Dysthe brothers' defender was Ole Røed. The case became a major scandal in the media as Vinmonopolet's role was unveiled. The board chairman Hans Halvorsen, who was a brother-in-law of the Prime Minister Johan Ludwig Mowinckel, had to resign together with board member Trygve Wettre and three employees.\n\nFrom the 1930s the brothers were active in the Norwegian-Third Reich friendship society Norsk-Tysk Selskap. He worked in McKesson & Robbins. and was a board member of Dysthe & Co.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, and Vidkun Quisling's party Nasjonal Samling (NS) became the only legal party, Dysthe sided with the German occupiers. He intrigued in order to weaken NS, and had contacts in the \"Reichskommissariat Norwegen\". At the same time he was a member of NS, although he claimed the reason for his membership was to inform the Germans about party affairs. Among others, he contributed to the downfall of Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie as president of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). Christie was a Norwegian nationalist and Quisling supporter, and as Dysthe was a special supervisor in the NRK from September 1941 he reported Christie to the \"Reichskommissariat\", who fired him. NRK had earlier been scrutinized by police inspector Gard Holtskog; however he advised to keep Christie and to limit the German influence.\n\nFrom 28 September 1940 Dysthe was also the chief executive of the company Nordisk Radio-Press. He also owned one share of stock. The Norwegian News Agency also had one share, but Nordisk Radio-Press took over the News Agency's task of delivering news to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. Historian Hans Fredrik Dahl has referred to Dysthe's company as a \"pure parasite\". It bought news from the Norwegian News Agency, and sold this expensively to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation without changing it. Members of the company's supervisory council were paid refunds for meetings that were never held. Dysthe was also behind the merger of the broadcast programming magazines \"Hallo-Hallo!\" and \"Radiobladet\" into \"Norsk Programblad\" in 1940. Nordisk Radio-Press was the publisher of \"Norsk Programblad\", but it went bankrupt in 1941 when the authorities confiscated all radios (except for those belonging to Nasjonal Samling members).\n\nDysthe had a personal campaign against cabinet member Albert Viljam Hagelin. In 1944 Dysthe intrigued and advised the \"Reichskommissariat\" to depose Quisling and his cabinet. For this Dysthe was excluded from Nasjonal Samling, and imprisoned. He was incarcerated in Bredtveit concentration camp from November 1944, then in Berg concentration camp from January 1945.\n\nAfter the war, when the Nazis were ousted and the legal purge in Norway after World War II took place, Dysthe was released from prison but subsequently convicted for treason in September 1946. He was sentenced to six years of forced labour, payable in compensation and the loss of his civil rights. He was later acquitted for treason in 1950, and moved to Canada in 1951. This was not uncontroversial as he probably contributed to the saving of many Norwegian lives, both by persuading German forces to enforce milder penalties, but also by leaking information. He received compensation from the Parliament of Norway in 1984. In 1993 the newspaper \"Verdens Gang\" called him a \"war hero\". Around that time he was still living, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n\n"}

Friedman Theatre (formerly the Biltmore Theatre) is a Broadway theatre located at 261 West 47th Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.\n\nDesigned by architect Herbert J. Krapp for impresario Irwin Chanin, the theatre opened on December 7, 1925, with the play \"Easy Come Easy Go\". With a seating capacity of 903, it was one of Broadway's smaller venues.\n\nThe theatre was used by Federal Theatre's Living Newspaper project in the 1930s. CBS leased it for use as a radio and television studio from 1952 until 1961. The producer David Cogan acquired the Biltmore in 1958. In 1968, the groundbreaking rock musical \"Hair\" opened at the theatre.\n\nIn 1986, Cogan sold the Biltmore to developer Samuel Pfeiffer in 1986. In 1987, a fire struck the Biltmore. The blaze, which was later determined to be an act of arson, destroyed the interior. After the fire, the building sat vacant for fourteen years, suffering more structural damage from water and vandals. Most plans proposed for its future use – such as a showcase for \"Best of Broadway\" revues – were rejected since its New York City landmark designation required it to operate only as a legitimate Broadway house if renovated. In 1993, the Nederlander Organization and Stewart F. Lane acquired the Biltmore; after being unable to secure a deal with theatre unions, the theatre was sold to developer Joseph Moinian.\n\nIn 2001, the theatre was assumed by the Manhattan Theatre Club as a permanent home for its productions. Polshek Partnership Architects restored surviving sections of the original theatre and EverGreene Architectural Arts restored plasterwork and reconstructed missing parts. With 622 seats the new Biltmore has about two-thirds of the capacity of the old venue, although it now boasts modern conveniences such as elevators and meeting rooms. The Biltmore's landmarked features, such as the proscenium arch, dome, staircases and a vaulted second-floor gallery, were restored or replicated.\n\nThe theatre was renamed the \"Samuel J. Friedman Theatre\" in a dedication ceremony held on September 4, 2008. The new name honors Broadway publicist Samuel J. Friedman. The Manhattan Theatre Club took ownership of the Samuel J.

It is especially relevant to disciplines which involve both business and information technology. A master course that focuses on service engineering and service science is the International Master in Service Engineering (IMSE).\n\nService science, management and engineering has developed in response to the need to combine technological and non-technological innovations in a rapidly growing environment. The term covers research, scientific projects, and innovative forms of education.\nThe discipline addresses the service sector's unique problems by using various approaches. It focuses on ICT, business, management, industrial engineering, socio-legal sciences, and economics. The innovative creation of value for both customers and shareholders is the heart of this interdisciplinary approach.\n\nA 'service-dominant' approach is starting to take over from the traditional goods-dominant approach. Some key factors of this service-dominant approach are:\n1. the realisation of a service as a process;\n2. a focus on dynamic resources, such as knowledge and skills\nService science stresses global economic developments such as globalization, competition, outsourcing, and interdependence.\n\nA 'service' can be described as: all intangible effects that result from a client interaction that creates and captures value. Services are everywhere in today's world. The sector ranges from common 'intangible' goods, such as health and education, to newer goods, such as modern communications and IT. Services are said to be essential to increase productivity and growth, and are considered salient to the development of knowledge-based economies. The growth of the service sector is in part a response to the change of traditional manufacturing industries into services. Many modern services combine both products and services, and the distinction between the two has blurred. However, a number of typical shared characteristics still distinguish services from goods-producing sectors. These include a clear focus on knowledge and ICT, ever-changing business processes, and unique financial, regulatory and investment structures. Service industries also cover a large variety of business types, from travel to highly knowledge-intensive services, such as global communication networks and specialized financial services. In general, knowledge-intensive services encompass both professional services (e.g. financial, legal), and science and technology-linked services (e.g. environmental, mining, health).\n\nThe explosive growth in services worldwide is seen as the next major revolution in the world economy. As service economies continue to expand and powerful digital communications networks – such as the Internet – evolve rapidly, companies are transforming from regional businesses to globally integrated enterprises. With the ever-increasing use of the Internet around the world, service networks and cloud computing will be key ingredients for this generation. The fast-growing discipline of service engineering is related to service economy growth and the global need for service innovation. Research and education in this field are therefore in high demand.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27567694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27567694", "title": "Workmanship", "text": "Workmanship\n\nWorkmanship is a human attribute relating to knowledge and skill at performing a task. The type of work may include the creation of handcrafts, art, writing, machinery and other products. Workmanship is also a quality imparted to a product.\n\nWorkmanship is considered to have been a valued human attribute even in prehistoric times. In the opinion of the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen, the sense of workmanship is probably the single most important attribute governing the material well being of a people, with only the parental instinct coming a close second. There have however been periods in history where workmanship was looked down on; for example in Classical Greece and Ancient Rome, where it had become associated with slavery. This was not always the case - back in the archaic period, Greeks had valued workmanship, celebrating it in Homeric hymns. In the western world, a return to a more positive attitude towards work emerged with the rise of Christianity. In Europe, Veblen considers that the social value of workmanship reached its peak with the \"Era of handicraft\". The era began as workmanship flourished with the relative peace and security of property rights that Europe had achieved by the Late middle ages. The era ended as machine driven processes began to displace the need for workmanship after the Industrial revolution. Workmanship was such a central concept during the handicraft era, that according to Veblen, even key theological questions about God's intentions for humanity were re-framed from \"What has God ordained?\" to \"What has God wrought?\". The high value placed on workmanship could sometimes be an oppressive force for certain individuals - for example, one explanation for the origin of the English phrase sent to Coventry is that it was born from the practice where London guild members expelled due to poor workmanship were forced to move to Coventry, which used to be a guild free town. But workmanship was still widely appreciated by the common people themselves. For example, when workers accustomed to practicing high standards of workmanship were first recruited to work on production lines in factories, it would be common for them to walk out, as the new roles were relatively monotonous, giving them little scope to use their skills. After Henry Ford introduced the first Assembly line in 1913, he could need to recruit about ten men to find one willing to stay in the job. Over time, and with Ford offering high rates of pay, the aversion of labor to the new ways of working was reduced.\n\nWorkmanship began to receive considerable attention from scholars once its place in society came under threat by the rise of industrialization. The Arts and Crafts movement arose in the late 19th and early 20th century, as workmanship began to be displaced by developments like greater emphases on process, machine work, and the separation of design and planning skills from the actual execution of work. Scholars involved in founding the movement, like William Morris, John Ruskin and Charles Eliot Norton, argued that the opportunity to engage in workmanship used to be a great source of fulfillment for the working class. From a historical perspective however, the arts and crafts movement has been seen as a palliative, which unintentionally reduced resistance to the displacement of workmanship.\n\nIn a book written on the nature of workmanship, David Pye writes that the displacement of workmanship has continued into the late 20th century. He writes that since World War II especially, there has been \"an enormous intensification of interest in design\", at the expense of workmanship. The trend started in the 19th century has continued, with Industrial processes increasingly designed to minimize the skill needed for workers to produce quality products. 21st century scholars such as Matthew Crawford have argued that office and other white collar work is now being displaced by similar technological developments to the ones that caused large numbers of manual workers to be made redundant from the late 19th to early 20th century. Even when the jobs remain, the cognitive aspects of the jobs taken away from the workers, due to knowledge being centralized. He calls for a revaluing of workmanship, saying that certain manual roles like mechanics, plumbers and carpenters have been resistant to further automation, and are among the most likely to continue offering the worker the chance for independent thought. Writers like Alain de Botton and Jane McGonigal have argued that the world of work needs to be reformed to make it more fulfilling and less stressful. In particular, workers need to be able to make a deeply felt imaginative connection between their own efforts and the end product. McGonigal argues that computer games can be a source of ideas for doing this; she says the primary reason for World of Warcraft being so popular is the sense of \"blissful productivity\" that its players enjoy.\n\nWorkmanship and Craftsmanship are sometimes considered synonyms, but many draw a distinction between the two terms, or at least consider craftsmanship to mean \"workmanship of the better sort\". Among those who do consider workmanship and craftsmanship to be different, the word \"workmanlike\" is sometimes even used as a pejorative, to suggest for example that while an author might understand the basics of their craft, they lack flair. David Pye has written that no one can definitively state where workmanship ends and craftsmanship begins.\n- an extract from a Homeric hymn celebrating craftsmanship.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, smiths and especially armor smiths developed unique symbols of workmanship to distinguish the quality of their work. These became some of the most unusual signs of workmanship, comparable to the \"mon\" family crests of Japan.\n\nIt has often been held in older economic writings that people are always adverse to labor and can only be motivated to work by threats or tangible rewards such as money. While Christianity has generally been positive about workmanship, certain Bible passages such as Genesis 3:17 (\"...Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.\") have contributed to the view that labor is a necessary evil, part of the punishment for original sin, but work existed before original sin and the fall of man in Genesis 2:15 (\"Yahweh God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.\") The view that work is a punishment takes Genesis 3:17 out of context. God's curse wasn't work, but that work would inherently be harder. Veblen and others agree with this view, saying that work can be inherently joyful and satisfying in its own right. Veblen acknowledges that humans have an innate tendency towards idleness, but asserts that they also have a countervailing tendency to value work for its own sake, as is demonstrated by the vast amount of work that is undertaken without obvious external pressure. As evidence for the widely shared instinct towards workmanship, Veblen also notes the near universal tendency for humans to approve of others' good work. Psychologist Pernille Rasmussen has written that the tendency to value work can become so strong that it stops being a positive source of motivation, contributing instead to some people losing balance and becoming workaholics.\n\nThe reliability of electronic devices is greatly affected by the quality of the workmanship. Therefore, the electronics manufacturing industry has developed several voluntary consensus standards to provide guidance on how products should be designed, built, inspected, and tested.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\n"}
