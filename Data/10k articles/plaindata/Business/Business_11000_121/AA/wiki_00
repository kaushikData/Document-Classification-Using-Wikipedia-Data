He is best known for owning two ironworks in Karlstad Municipality, Värmland County, Sweden: Duvnäs (Duvenäs), and Nedre Fösked (Föske).\n\nCarl was born on October 12, 1753, in Stockholm. On June 26, 1764, at the age of 10, he enrolled at Uppsala University under Stockholm's Nation. After graduating in 1771, he moved with his parents to their estate at Duvnäs where he focused primarily on agriculture and working at the family's mill. Carl was said to have a Godly and humble disposition and loved books above all else.\n\nCarl presumebly took over operations at Duvnäs upon his father's death in 1788. On December 12, 1794, at the age of 42 he married Elisabeth Antonsson at Molkoms Mill. She was the only daughter of the Värmland renowned ironmaster, Judge Reinhold Antonsson.

{"id": "50552496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50552496", "title": "Comfort (magazine)", "text": "Comfort (magazine)\n\nComfort was a mail order magazine published in Augusta, Maine from 1888 to 1942. Published by Gannet & Morris and edited initially by William H. Gannet, \"Comfort\" was touted as \"the key to happiness and success in over a million and quarter homes.\"\n\nIn 1888, William H. Gannet created \"Comfort\" primarily as a means to advertise his patent medicine, Giant Oxien, a variant of The Moxie Nerve Food. \"Comfort\"s circulation increased from 13,000, in 1888, to 1.3 million, in 1894, which made \"Comfort\" the first publication in America to reach a circulation of 1 million. In order to handle this increase in circulation, Gannet purchased a new rotary color convertible web-fed press, which was one of the first of its kind in the country.\n\nThe increase in \"Comfort\"s circulation was primarily due to its use of premiums to generate subscriptions. Premiums, essentially rewards like sewing machines or clothing, were given to people who submitted \"clubs\" or lists of new subscribers. As Frank Luther Mott notes in his book, \"A History of American Magazines\", the use of the \"'club' device made the solicitor virtually a local subscription agent for the periodical.\" Most of the time, publishers of mail-order magazines did not depend on the collection of subscription fees and instead generated income by selling their subscription lists to advertisers.\n\nThe practice of not collecting subscriptions fees went against the United States Post Office Department's criteria that required publications to maintain \"a legitimate list of subscribers\" in order to take advantage of the low second-class mailing rate of one-cent per pound. In 1907, as a way to curb further abuse of the second-class postal rate, the US Post Office mandated that all subscription fees must be paid in advance. Many mail-order magazines could not meet this requirement and folded. The publishers of \"Comfort\", who were more firm about collecting payment than other mail-order magazine publishers, lowered \"Comfort\"s price to 15 cents a year in order to meet with the new regulations.\n\nTo prevent mail-order magazines from becoming little more than advertisement catalogs, the US Post Office also required mail-order magazines provide readers with \"information of a public character, or devoted to literature, the sciences, arts, or some special industry.\" This regulation may explain why \"Comfort\" claimed on its front page to be \"devoted to art, literature, science, and the home circle.\" In addition to the columns of advertisements, \"Comfort\" provided readers with various articles geared to meet the needs and interests of every member of the rural, American family. With articles like \"In & Around the Home,\" \"Comfort Sisters' Recipes,\" and \"The Pretty Girls' Club,\" much of \"Comfort\" was dominated by content for women, which offered advice and information on cooking, sewing, health, and beauty. \"Comfort\" also printed articles aimed at men, although not as many, such as \"The Modern Farmer\" and \"Automobile and Gas Engine Helps.\" For children, \"Comfort\" occasionally published puzzles, activities, and comics. \n\nAnother prominent feature of \"Comfort\" was its short and serialized fiction. When \"Comfort\" was first published, much of the fiction was written by William H. Gannet as a means to further plug Giant Oxien and other products displayed in the magazine's advertisements. From roughly September 1892 to April 1902, \"Comfort\" offered prizes to readers who submitted works of fiction for publication. In later years, \"Comfort\" went on to publish fiction written by more legitimate and well known authors such as Augusta Jane Evans, Mrs. Georgie Sheldon, Horatio Alger Jr., Charles Felton Pidgin, and L. M. Montgomery. The fiction published in \"Comfort\" was usually highly moral and typically fell into three genres: Adventure, Mystery, or Sentimental Romance. Additionally, \"Comfort\" printed stories for children. The Cubby Bear stories, written by Lena B. Ellingwood and illustrated by Harrison Cady, were the most regular children's fiction published in \"Comfort\".\n\nIn 1940, \"Comfort\" was sold to the Needlecraft Publishing Corporation. Needlecraft Publishing continued to publish \"Comfort\" for two years until it was combined with \"Needlecraft\" magazine, which ceased to be published soon after.\n\n"}

The 3-day CFE is also reputed to be among the world's most challenging professional exams where students are required to use an integrative business thinking model to obtain the designation. Previously known as the Uniform Evaluation (UFE), the UFE has been discontinued following the unification of the three accounting designations (CA, CMA, CGA) in Canada and Bermuda in June 2015.\n\nAdministered nationally by CPA Canada, and conducted regionally by the provincial/regional orders, the CFE is written over the course of three sequential days and is the culmination of years of study in financial accounting, management accounting, corporate finance, performance management, taxation and other business-related university courses. Writing the CFE requires successful completion of preliminary education requirements including CPA preparatory courses and Professional Education Program (PEP). Upon passing the CFE and 30 months of approved practical experiences, the candidate will become a Chartered Professional Accountant.\n\nThe Common Final Exam is typically offered once per year in September (Fall). Sometimes, it may be offered twice a year in Spring and Fall (such as May and September 2016). The upcoming CFE dates are: September 11 - September 13, 2019. Two CFEs are scheduled for 2020, between May 26 - May 29 and September 9 - September 11, 2020.\n\n\n\nOld UFE Competency Map:\n\nStudents must demonstrate the depth and breadth of their abilities according to the CPA Competency Map. Students answer questions which are presented in the form of business cases that include a combination of both explicit and implicit requirements for each case's \"users\", followed by a list of exhibits that provide case facts from which observations, suggestions and conclusions are derived. Common scenarios include providing advice on how to conduct an audit, advising a client on the pros and cons of investing funds in a given business venture, and providing support to an organization as an internal accountant or auditor. \n\nAll students must demonstrate \"depth\" in financial reporting or management accounting for the CFE, and one of the elective areas. Students should also demonstrate \"breadth\" in all 6 competency areas.\n\nThe 3-day exam consisted of case based simulations: \n\n\n\nAll CPA cases are evaluated based on \"Competency Ratings\". They are:\n\nThe evaluation decision is separate into day 1 and day 2 with day 3. A student must pass all 3 days in order to \"pass the CFE\". However, Day 1 is marked separately and Day 2 & 3 are marked together. Therefore, a candidate can pass Day 1 and fail Day 2 & 3 and vice versa.\n\nA candidate may attempt the Common Final Examination 3 times maximum. A student will be deregistered after their third unsuccessful attempt at either Core 1, Core 2, Capstone 1, Capstone 2 or the CFE. A student may not be admitted back to CPA or re-registered except in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe exam is administered once per year during September and approximately 5,500 students attempt the exam each year. National pass rates for 2003 to 2008 have been 65.5%, 74.5%, 74.0%, 79.3%, 74.6%, and 71.7% respectively. Exam results are released in late November following each September sitting of the UFE.\n\nBeginning with the September 2009 UFE, the Board of Evaluators no longer releases statistics on pass rates.\n\nThe CFE Board of Evaluators began releasing statistics on pass rates along with Board Reports on candidate performance. The following are the first attempts of CFE Pass Rates for CFE:\n\nSince 2005, students have been able to type in their responses on laptop computers secured with Securexam (CA) lockdown software in all regions of Canada. Use of computer is no longer voluntary. It became a requirement to use a computer starting with the 2009 UFE.\n\nEvery CFE, the Board would release the Honour Roll recipients along with the CFE results. The CFE honour roll members consists of the nation's top 1% performers on the exam and recognizes performance in the exam that demonstrated academic excellence and exceptional abilities. The Honour Roll of 68 candidates is determined as the top 1% of the first-time writers that wrote all three days. Among the honour roll members, a national Gold Medal (highest standing in Canada) is selected, along with 3 provincial gold medalists (top performers in their respective CPA representations). The CPA Governor General's Gold Medal (National Gold Medal) is awarded to 1 individual for a cash prize of $5,000. While each regional Gold Medalist receives a cash price of $2,500 each. \n\n2018: \nOntario - https://www.cpaontario.ca/cfe2018/cfe-exam-results\n"}

Corporate universities (CU) are a growing trend in corporations. In 1993, corporate universities existed in only 400 companies. By 2001, this number had increased to 2,000, including Walt Disney, Boeing, and Motorola.\n\nThe 'corporate university' also refers to public universities which have developed, or have been forced by states to develop, corporate style behaviour. \n\nIn most cases, corporate universities are not universities in the strict sense of the word. The traditional university is an educational institution which grants both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in a variety of subjects, as well as conducting original scientific research. In contrast, a corporate university typically limits scope to providing job-specific, indeed company-specific, training for the managerial personnel of the parent corporation. Corporate universities are most commonly found in the United States, a nation which has no official legal definition of the term \"university\". Perhaps the best known corporate university is the Hamburger University operated by McDonald's Corporation in Chicago.\n\nCorporate universities are set up for a variety of reasons, but most organizations have the same basic needs. These are to:\n\nCUs offer valuable training and education to employees, but they also help organizations retain and promote key employees. Although a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project.\n\nJ.P. Morgan and Co. is an example of a company with an organized curriculum. They have three different types of courses: Business specific courses, organizational learning and communication classes, and management and executive training. What your company decides to offer will depend on your needs (such as sales training, marketing, or soft skills) and your company's business (like manufacturing, consulting, or technology). \n\nMost CUs offer a blended curriculum of online and in person classes. Some organizations offer courses during the workday while other offer them at varying times. Courses can be short workshops or longer, more traditional courses. \n\nUnlike traditional universities, CUs demand a return on their investment. There must be concrete evidence that the classroom is delivering results. Many CUs provide hands-on and team learning as a more effective alternative to lecture-based courses, but all CUs agree that what is learned in the classroom should be directly applicable to the work environment.\n\nAlthough a CU may sound attractive, there is a lot of work that goes into the planning and implementation of such a project such as complex logistics, resource optimization and careful budgeting. Indeed, corporate universities tend to be cost centers with dedicated training facilities servicing an often global workforce through a dedicated curriculum. To manage this complexity, specific Enterprise resource planning systems have been developed for Corporate Universities, such as a Training management system. Other systems such as accounting systems and different types of learning technologies can be used together.\n\n\n"}

He was business manager of the sales support department of the Lara audiovisual company (1973), then commercial agent in the audiovisual (1974-1975) and associate director at the Auto Racing company (1977).\n\nIn 1979, upon the death of his father (who was murdered by his valet), he inherited large real estate holdings, a sugar refinery and 28 companies. He became CEO of \"Financière Robur et de Cofragec\" (1982-1992), \"Coficine\" (1984-1992) and many other companies.\n\nHe modernized the sugar factory and his inheritance prospered, taking, in 1981, control of the holding Fraissinet, owner of the business airline Transair. In 1987, he started a new career in film distribution by acquiring, from the producer Robert Dorfmann, by one of its companies, the \"Financière Robur\", Cofragec company with its catalog of 650 films including \"La Grande Vadrouille\" or \"La Vache et le Prisonnier\". He produced movies including \"La Nuit bengali\" (1988) of Nicolas Klotz, \"Les Deux Fragonard\" (1989) of Philippe Le Guay, and \"La Peste\" (1992) of Luis Puenzo. He also invested in real estate, including a hotel in Tahiti.\n\nPassionate about cars and racing, he rallied with Thierry Sabine, including Abidjan-Nice driving a Range Rover.\n\nIn 1989, he started a political career in \"Haute-Marne\", a department where which his grandfather Charles de Rouvre was a deputy during the Third Republic. He was elected mayor of Chaumont, as an independent (classified as miscellaneous right) against the centrist senator and mayor Georges Berchet, and regional councilor for the Champagne-Ardenne region (1992-1998).\n\nHe takes his team, as an alderman, a man of 25 years, Luc Chatel, becoming in fact the first « political godfather ».\n\nOwner of the Formula 1 team AGS from March 1989 to 1991, he swallowed $ 18 million and began selling activities of his group, about 70 companies: First Transair, then the sugar factory, sold to the \"Compagnie de Navigation Mixte\", and in 1992, the catalog of movies, lent to UGC in the form of a merger. In 1991, he gives AGS the Italians Gabriele Rafanelli and Patrizio Cantu.\n\nIn 1992, Cyril de Rouvre bought the Formula 1 team Ligier for an estimated price of 200 million of francs. With its new owner, the team started to again be competitive - the 1993 season was a success, with a 5th place in the constructor's championship (the team's best result since 1986). But the involvement of Cyril de Rouvre lasted only one season because of legal troubles.\n\nThe 14 December 1993, the judge Eva Joly incarcerated him at the Fleury-Mérogis Prison, as part of a complaint for fraud filed by the leaders of UGC, Guy Verrecchia and Alain Sussfeld, following the takeover in June 1992 the company Cofragec. This company has been emptied of its assets, leaving a liability estimated at 172.6 million francs. Cyril de Rouvre had promised to repay this sum at the end of 1992 but at that time, he still had 100 million. On 5 May 1993, leaders of UGC have filed a complaint against him. He spent two months in prison.\n\nIn early 1994, he sold Ligier to Flavio Briatore.\n\nHe lost the mayoralty of Chaumont at the French municipal elections of 1995.\n\nIn 1996, a judicial investigation was opened against him at the \"Tribunal de grande instance\" of Chaumont. He appeared before the Criminal Court of this city in September 1999 for tax evasion. Knowing that the prosecution had requested a sentence of three years imprisonment and a 20-year ban on company management, he was sentenced on 19 December 1999, his birthday, to a suspended sentence of 18 months imprisonment' a ban from managing a company for 3 years, and a large fine.\n\n"}

It exists to serve the creative needs of artists—emerging, mid-career and established—who are creating new work in theater, dance, music, literature, puppetry, performance, variety and visual arts.\n\nMany well-known artists, including Ivy Baldwin, Blue Man Group, Laura Peterson, Monica Bill Barnes, John Leguizamo, Lisa Kron, David Cale, Jane Comfort, Risa Jaroslow, Penny Arcade, Katy Pyle, Peggy Shaw, Douglas Dunn, Deb Margolin and\nReno, began their careers at Dixon Place.\n\nDixon Place offers 14 shows a week, 7–8 commissions a year, and more than 20 different programs across artistic disciplines, featuring work by more than 1,500 emerging and established artists each year. All artists presenting work in Dixon Place’s main-stage programs receive compensation, from work-in-progress showings to artists-in-residence and commissioned artists.\n\nDixon Place was founded in 1985 by Artistic Director Ellie Covan. After starting Dixon Place as a salon in her Paris apartment in the summer of 1985, Covan re-launched the endeavor in her East Village living room the following year. Her apartment was half of a storefront; she set up folding chairs for audiences and sold drinks and snacks to defray her expenses.\nAfter 5 years at the East Village location, Dixon Place needed to expand. In order to accommodate a growing audience, Dixon Place moved to a larger space on the Bowery in 1991. The loft also served as living space for Covan. Expanded programming, along with an increased staff and audience, prompted another move in 1999, when Dixon Place became the resident company at the Vineyard Theater’s 26th Street space. Success in this professional environment led to the decision to secure a permanent home. In 2002, in partnership with a dedicated Board and a forward-thinking developer, Dixon Place purchased an industrial space on Chrystie Street in Lower Manhattan. After a 6-year capital project, Dixon Place's state-of-the-art laboratory theater and lounge, featuring expanded amenities for artists and audiences and new earned income for Dixon Place, had its Grand Opening in December 2009.\n\nIn addition to a professional laboratory theater, the new space, designed by Meyer + Gifford Architects, includes numerous artist amenities The main-stage theater has column-free width for performance, as well as a sprung masonite floor, high ceilings, rigging points for aerial work, and state-of-the-art technical equipment. There is a separate rehearsal studio with a sprung marmoleum floor, and the spacious dressing room includes a private artist’s restroom and shower.\n\nDixon Place also includes a welcoming lounge. Set up as a for-profit subsidiary with a full liquor license, it is a new business model that subsidizes the theater's artistic programs. The lounge includes a gallery and a smaller stage that provides additional artistic outlets and day-time community space for educational programs and a meeting place for other organizations.\n\nAll of Dixon Place's programs have been developed out of a specific need that was not being met elsewhere.\n\nIn 1994, Dixon Place began the Mondo Cane! Commissioning Program that supports 8 theater, dance and music creators annually by providing them with 1–3 months of workshop time, followed by 1–4 weeks of world premiere full-scale production performances. Mondo Cane! has offered commissions to such artists as The Civilians, The Debate Society and Sibyl Kempson. In 2015, Dixon Place will present world premiere commissions by James Godwin, Mark Dendy, Marga Gomez, Raja Feather Kelly, Victor Morales, ANIMALS, and Jessica Almasy.\n\nDixon Place offers over 20 year-round, curated programs:\n\nBegun in 2000, the Cultural Education & Community Outreach Program (CECO) provides rare artistic opportunities for culturally under-served senior citizens and youth living in Lower Manhattan, at no cost to the participants. CECO has brought theater, writing, dance and film/video workshops to local youth in collaboration with such partners as Urban Arts Partnership, New Design High School, University Settlement, Tompkins Square Middle School and The School for Global Leaders; and to senior citizens, collaborating with Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE), Sirovich Senior Center and Bowery Residents Committee (BRC) Senior Center-Chinatown. With this program, Dixon Place has reached beyond the artist community to include the voices of low-to-moderate income young and elderly neighbors. The free workshops focus on performing, writing, movement, and music, culminating in public performances. This program enables the participants to experience artistic expression, discover their creative voices, develop their own theatrical works and perform in front of supportive audiences.\n\nIn 1990, The Village Voice awarded Dixon Place a special OBIE Award.\n\nPrivate and Corporate Support for Dixon Place is provided by: Axe-Houghton Foundation, Bernstein Family Foundation, New York Department of Cultural Affairs, Doris Duke Foundation, Harkness Foundation for Dance, The Jim Henson Foundation, Jerome Foundation, Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Mertz Gilmore Foundation, Jerome Robbins Foundation, Fan Fox & Leslie R. Samuels Foundation, New York State Council on the Arts, The Peg Santvoord Foundation, The Shubert Foundation.\n"}

The critical path methodology is also essential.\n\nEngineer to order environments must employ a flexible and adaptive, demand-driven approach to the manufacturing process. It is usually the right solution when details on a customer order are not provided and engineering development must be added to product lead time.\n\nETO is a technique that is leveraged to boost sales and improve margins for those companies with customers needing solutions that are tailored to fit their own unique environment. It begins with selling product concepts that don’t have fixed designs and are expected to result in a new, unique end product. This could be any product, from enterprise software applications to special aircraft to a pair of jeans. But the typical ETO environment usually deals with the design and build of unique custom engineered complex machinery and industrial equipment - one in which there is heavy involvement of the following engineering disciplines; mechanical, electrical, mechatronics, software, manufacturing and systems engineering. The ETO company works with its customers to develop new products that satisfy the customer’s requirements and specifications.\n\nThe difference between the ETO approach to production and make to order products is that engineering original products to order includes the entire design process. In MTO companies typically have a fixed design and specifications to start with. The existing design is followed, even if the customer requests some customization of dimensions or materials. In engineering to meet unique customer orders, designs spring from collaboration with the customer, beginning with a need and a concept. Engineers do not know the final specifications, materials, or in software development, even the network or application platform until other primary concepts are ironed out. This is a much more creative process and requires a much closer relationship with clients, ultimately leading to a product that is unique.\n\nEngineers don’t always follow a smooth flow from step to step even in ordinary manufacturing. Most manufacturing design decisions tends to be highly iterative. It is common to create a design that meets customer approval, test it, make changes to meet specifications, and resubmit at certain stages or milestones in order for approval to proceed to the next stage. Engineer to order, due to its nature, is even more complex and client-centric. This requires on-going documentation, but the approach typically involves all of the following steps.\n\n\nGiven the unique nature of the delivered product, clients may accept certain quality risks as a consequence of meeting delivery dates. Testing and trial periods may also be limited by the nature of the product, the manufacturing required, and the metrics established for quality controls. As each product is essentially a one of a kind prototype, smaller companies on either the manufacturer or client side may not have the expertise or resources to implement use-cases, user testing, or future quality guidelines. In MTO, quality is often defined as a lack of defects, but must meet minimal levels defined in the specifications. In Engineer to Order there is no original design. Where possible, prior similar products may provide some guidelines as to testing and precision, but the idea of re-designing or modifying an existing design is necessarily a core requirement of the engineer to order concept. It does however reduce costs and time if one can use previous designs.\n"}
{"id": "32822907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32822907", "title": "Evelin Banev", "text": "Evelin Banev\n\nBanev became known for his imprisonment and multiple criminal prosecutions for alleged money laundering and drug traffickingalong side mafia boss Pedro in several countries, including Bulgaria and Italy. In July 2014, the Sofia Court of Appeal acquitted Banev of all criminal charges against him and overturned a -year sentence issued previously by the Sofia City Court. In September 2015, Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation annulled his 20-year prison term for drug trafficking and returned the case for retrial to the Appellate Court of Milan. Banev's prosecutions, alleged criminal activities, and imprisonment have been highly controversial and politicized. During his imprisonment, Banev's 10-year-old daughter was abducted and freed after almost two months in captivity.\n\nIn 2015, Banev published his first book, \"I Gaze Upon the Soul of Bulgaria\", which he wrote during his time in prison.\n\nBanev was born in Burgas, Bulgaria.\n\nSince 1985, when he enrolled to the National Sports Academy, Brendo has lived in Sofia. During his time at the Academy, Banev frequently travelled to international camps, tournaments and wrestling competitions representing his club \"Academic - Sofia\" and the Bulgarian National Wrestling Team. Banev has been awarded the \"Master of Sport\" title in Bulgaria and wrestled in the 74 kg category, under the instruction of Dimitar Dobrev.\n\nAfter the 1989 political changes in Eastern Europe, Banev spent most of his time outside of Bulgaria. During that time, Banev accumulated his fortune during the Dot-com bubble. He is also a real estate investor and entrepreneur involved in multiple projects in Bulgaria's riviera and capital.\n\nIn April 2007, the Sofia City Prosecutor indicted Banev for organizing a criminal group and money laundering. Subsequently, Banev was arrested and released on bail.\n\nBanev's case caused a media stir again in 2008, when Switzerland agreed to lift its bank secrecy and to submit bank documentation to the Bulgarian authorities. Later, it was made public, that in its requests for judicial assistance to Switzerland, the Bulgarian Prosecutor's Office has sent false information – i.e. stating that Banev is accused of drug trafficking and distribution rather than of money laundering.\n\nAs of May 2012, Banev's case was still pending with court hearings being postponed at the request of the prosecution. In relation to the case, various Bulgarian media and EU commission reports commented on the groundless accusations and the abuse of power by the prosecution. At this time, the Bulgarian authorities initiated operation \"Cocaine Kings\" with an overwhelming media coverage, including a press conference with the Italian authorities. During the operation, some 30 people were arrested, including Banev. Banev was accused of allegedly financing drug trafficking between South America and Europe, and Italy claimed responsibility for criminally charging him.\n\nFollowing operation \"Cocaine Kings\", Italy requested a temporary extradition of Banev, which he and his legal team fought. However, the Bulgarian Court of Appeals confirmed Banev's 1-year extradition to Italy on July 17, 2012, with the condition that he will be returned to Bulgaria when needed for his money laundering trial. The extradition hearing was not without controversy, as the court denied Banev's right to appoint a new defense attorney and rejected the request of the publicly appointed attorney for more time to familiarize herself with the case. Banev was extradited to Italy on July 26, 2012.\n\nIn February 2013, Sofia City Court sentenced Banev to 7 1/2 years in prison, while acquitting the other 3 people accused with him. Banev’s lawyer, Ina Lulcheva, said that the appeal against the finding of the Sofia City Court would be based on a lack of evidence justifying the conviction. That the group had travelled together made them at most a tour group, not an organised crime group, she said. The defense further stated:\n\nAfter a 4-month trial, in July 2013, the Milan City Court sentenced Banev to 20 years in prison for participating in a criminal organization for international drug trafficking. Banev's defense attorney stated that, \"Banev has not even entered Italy\" and that there is not one evidence linking him to the charges. Before the court, his attorney pointed out that all of the Milan prosecutor evidence was coming from Bulgaria, not from Italy - in Italy, Banev was never under surveillance, wiretapped, followed, or investigated. The Italian judge who sentenced Banev, stated in an interview with a prominent Bulgarian newspaper that he highly recommends that Banev appeals the sentencing because \"until now not a single evidence of Banev's guilt has been deposited; Banev has never been caught in the act of crime, and he was sentenced only by the testimonies (which were presumed truthful) of other defendants\".\n\nFollowing the trial, Banev was extradited to Bulgaria, where in July 2014, the Sofia Court of Appeal ruled him \"not guilty\" of money laundering and released him on probation.\n\nOn September 22, 2015, Italy’s Supreme Court of Cassation annulled Banev's 20-year prison term for alleged drug trafficking and ordered a retrial to the Appellate Court of Milan. Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the sentences of all other people convicted under the \"Cocaine Kings\" affair. The court cited that Banev's unjust conviction was due to lack of any evidence and irregularities in the use of facts. In annulling his 20-year conviction, the court reported that Banev's net worth and political neutrality had led to \"antagonisms that motivated incorrect assessment of [his] personality\".\n\nBanev said that he was invited in writing to a meeting with the Interior Minister, Rumen Petkov, who requested Brendo’s assistance – i.e. to falsely testify against “the Margin” brothers. According to Banev, his refusal to cooperate with the Minister is the main reason behind the 2007 charges for money laundering against him.\n\nBanev's ten-year-old daughter, Lara, was kidnapped by three masked men at about 7:30 am on March 5, 2013, while leaving her home in Sofia. The men shot her unarmed driver twice in the back. It was the first kidnapping in Bulgaria since 2009. The motives behind the kidnapping were the cause for much speculation. In a televised press conference three days later, Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov stated that, \"The kidnapping of Lara is a message to Brendo\".\n\nThis leads to the other suspicion - the key politicians of Boyko Borisov's cabinet in resignation - Prime Minister Borisov himself, Minister of Interior Tzvetan Tzvetanov, and the Chief of the Chief Directorate \"Combating Organized Crime\", Stanimir Florov. As stated by Aleksey Petrov, \"If Brendo talks about Borisov, Tzvetanov, and Florov, it will be frightening\". The media states that the failing GERB party, via its two main figures, Borisov and Tzvetanov, is trying to keep the power and to win the elections at any cost - using a brutal kidnapping as a sign that \"without them organized crime is coming back\" while sending a signal to Banev to keep quiet. This message was clearly given by Tzvetanov himself during a TV interview in which he avoided the question \"Where is Lara?\" several times and finally answered, \"What happened is unpleasant, but let's not forget who her father is\". Let's recall that her father is a great figure in the underworld and is considered untouchable.\n\nLara Baneva was released, physically unharmed, on April 21, 2013; she was left in front of a police station in Sofia at approximately 10:00 pm. It was reported, but unconfirmed, that the kidnappers had originally demanded a €10 million ransom, but later agreed to free her in exchange of €530,000.\n\nIn March 2015, Evelin Banev published a novel titled \"I gaze upon the soul of Bulgaria\" (Bulgarian: \"Съзирам Душата на България\"), which he wrote while in prison. The spiritual novel is about the journey to self-discovery and realization as passed on by the main character, Max, after a 20-year imprisonment, to his daughter Anna. Banev is also the artist of the book cover - an illustration of two mandalas.\n"}

It could also do chucking work (feeding of unformed blanks or pieces of stock from a magazine to be automatically gripped by the machine for turning). Examples of workpieces included automotive steering knuckles and transmission gears, and such work done on mandrels as flanges, disks, and hubs. The machine tool was developed by F.C. Fay of Philadelphia and improved by Otto A. Schaum. It was originally manufactured by the Fay & Scott Machine Shop. James Hartness acquired manufacturing rights on behalf of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company and manufactured an improved version, developed under the management of Ralph Flanders.\n\nIn 1937 Roe, writing for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, framed the importance of the Fay automatic lathe to the capabilities of machine tools by saying that, \"This machine does for the engine lathe what Spencer did for the old hand-operated turret lathe.\" These machines took an entire class of turned work formerly requiring an operator to execute the series of movements necessary to shape a piece of metal (manual control) and allowed the same work to be done automatically. This step forward in automation lowered a manufacturer's unit expense per part by reducing labor costs. Today, numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools such as turning centers, turn-mills, and rotary transfer machines have largely supplanted cam-operated automatics.\n\n"}

He served on the United States Commission of Fine Arts in the 1970s and was a member of the Du Pont family.\n\nHis mother, Dulcinea \"Deo\" Ophelia Payne du Pont (November 28, 1909 – February 8, 1981), was the eldest of Eugene Eleuthere du Pont's (August 27, 1882-December 15, 1954) four daughters. Frolic was six generations removed from Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, the founder of the DuPont corporation. In 1930, Dulcinea married investment banker George T. Weymouth (December 14, 1904-June 7, 1990).\n\nWeymouth was christened George Alexis Weymouth. According to a well-known story, shortly after George's birth, his 3-year-old brother, Gene, lost his foxhound. After repeatedly asking his mother, \"Where’s Frolic?\" his exasperated mother replied, \"Shut up! Here’s your damn Frolic!\" and thrust George before Gene. The name stuck.\n\nWeymouth graduated from St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts in 1954. He received his undergraduate degree in American studies from Yale University in 1958. Weymouth suffered from dyslexia, but he believed that being from a prominent family enabled him to graduate from Yale. \"I couldn't read and write or spell. I still can't. I don't know anything but painting pictures and being on a horse,\" he said in 2007.\n\n\"It’s no big deal\" being a du Pont, he once said. In 2000, 3,700 members of the Du Pont family attended a reunion at Longwood Gardens. Several years later Weymouth wondered aloud, \"How many there are now? Du Ponts have always been busy in bed.\"\n\nWeymouth was married to Anna Brelsford McCoy for 18 years until their divorce in 1979. He has one son, Mac, whom he adopted.\n\nHe resided in a converted 17th-century Swedish trading post with an 18th-century addition on called \"Big Bend\" (a translation of an Indian name for the land) in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, that he purchased in 1961. According to Weymouth, William Penn originally purchased the land from the Native American Lenape tribe in 1683. Big Bend was the Lenape's original term for the land, which lies along the Brandywine Creek.\n\nWeymouth died on April 24, 2016 at his home in Chadds Ford from complications of congestive heart failure at the age of 79, according to Andrew Stewart, a spokesman for the conservancy and museum.\n\nWeymouth’s early work, done in egg tempera, was often highly personal. His portrait of his grandfather, Eugene du Pont, Jr., features the detail of a herringbone suit coat and the worn fabric of a favorite recliner. His \"The Way Back\" (1963) is a self-portrait of only his hands guiding a single horse carriage up the lane to Big Bend.\n\nWeymouth painted portraits of Luciano Pavarotti (1982) and of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (1995), Queen Elizabeth’s husband, a work which hangs in Windsor Castle. Weymouth was selected by NASA to paint at Cape Canaveral during the moon shots.\n\nThrough his circle of fellow artists, Weymouth became a close friend and relation of artist Andrew Wyeth. He was married to artist Anna Brelsford McCoy, Andrew Wyeth’s niece. They divorced in 1979. Jamie Wyeth, Andrew Wyeth’s son, married Weymouth’s cousin Phyllis.\n\nWeymouth was the confidant who discreetly hid Andrew Wyeth’s nudes of Prussian-born neighbor and caretaker Helga Testorf for 17 years before they became public. In the 2004 documentary, \"The Way Back: A Portrait of George A. Weymouth\", Andrew Wyeth said he didn't \"know of anyone who means as much to me.\"\n\nHe helped found the Brandywine River Museum, which presents the work of Andrew Wyeth, N.C. Wyeth, Jamie Wyeth, other Wyeth family members (including those such as Peter Hurd related by marriage) and selections from the canon of American art. Weymouth served on the Visual Arts Panel of the Pennsylvania Council of the Arts and received many awards, including the Cliveden Heritage Preservation Award and the University of Delaware Merit Award for Community Service. Weymouth was a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1972 to 1977.\n\nIn a conversation about Andy Warhol, Jamie Wyeth expressed the opinion that Frolic Weymouth was the \"real character.\"\n\nWeymouth surrounded himself with art and gardens. A centerpiece in Weymouth’s Big Bend is \"The Vidette,\" an enormous painting of a horseman in the snow dating from 1912. This N.C. Wyeth work is occasionally on loan for exhibitions. Anna Hyatt Huntington’s \"Greyhounds Playing\" graces the garden. Elsewhere, a carved wooden Indonesian fertility bench features two interlocked monkeys, highlighting Weymouth’s admitted fascination with fornication.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Weymouth convinced friends F.I. du Pont and William Prickett to help him buy two parcels in Chadds Ford, along the banks of the Brandywine Creek which had been proposed for industrial development. This purchase led to the founding of the Tri-County Conservancy, now known as the Brandywine Conservancy & Museum of Art, an environmental, arts, and cultural preservation organization that subsequently led to the founding of such organizations all over the country. Frolic was the chairman of the board of the Brandywine Conservancy from that point on until his death. The organization has permanently protected from development more than 62,000 acres in southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware.\n\nIn 1969, Weymouth donated his property to the Brandywine Conservancy as its first conservation easement. His home, \"The Big Bend,\" surrounded by Brandywine Creek on three sides, is just inside Pennsylvania at the northern Delaware border. The period-furnished 1750s stone house addition to the original 1650s Swedish log cabin is surrounded by gardens. His donation was followed by those of the Harry G. Haskell, Jr., Ford B. Draper, and Jamie Wyeth. The four easements protected almost and 5 miles along the Brandywine Creek.\n\nIn 1984, the King Ranch in Pennsylvania went to market. Rumored buyers included a nuclear power plant, Disney, and a real estate developer. Weymouth organized a conservation team to purchase the for $11.5 million. The land is now conserved and includes the Laurels Preserve.\n\nIn 1967, a mill along the Brandywine went up for auction. Through miscommunication, Weymouth and the Conservancy acquired it. The Brandywine River Museum opened in the building in 1971 after the mill was renovated, including the addition of soaring, glass-walled lobbies on three floors.\n\nWeymouth was a whip, the owner and driver of a coach. He acquired a collection of antique coaches and carriages and used them regularly. He had deeded rights-of-way on neighboring properties to be able to drive his four-in-hand around northern Delaware. His passengers through the years included Richard Nixon and Michael Jackson.\n\nHe initiated and led the coaching event at the Winterthur Museum's Point-to-Point in Delaware. He permanently retired a trophy at the Devon Horse Show in Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1985, he spent three months in England and managed to drive a carriage . He whipped another in France.\n\nHe once drove from New York City's Upper East Side to Saratoga Springs, New York, and then on to Shelburne, Vermont. Carriages are not uncommon around Central Park but taking the carriage through Harlem caused a sensation.\n\n\n\n"}

She was First Lady of New York from her marriage to then-Governor Rockefeller in 1963 until he left office in 1973, and Second Lady of the United States during her husband's tenure as Vice President from December 19, 1974 until his term ended on January 20, 1977.\n\nMargaretta Large Fitler was born at Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, in 1926. Her parents were Margaretta Large Harrison and William Wonderly Fitler Jr., an heir to a cordage fortune. (Later her mother would marry again.) The younger Margaretta was known by her nickname, \"Happy\", given to her for her childhood disposition. She was a great-granddaughter of Philadelphia mayor Edwin Henry Fitler and a great-great-granddaughter of Union general George Gordon Meade, the commander at the Battle of Gettysburg, and his wife Margaretta Sergeant, daughter of politician John Sergeant.\n\nOn December 11, 1949, she married James Slater Murphy, a virologist associated with the Rockefeller Institute and a close friend of Nelson Rockefeller's. They had four children: James B. Murphy, II, Margaretta Harrison Murphy, Carol Slater Murphy, and Malinda Fitler Murphy (1960–2005). Malinda married Francis Menotti, the adopted son of composer Gian Carlo Menotti.\n\nHappy and her husband divorced on April 1, 1963, for reasons \"The New York Times\" called \"grievous mental anguish\" and her former husband's lawyer classified as \"irreconcilable differences\". One month later – on May 4, 1963 – at the home of Laurance S. Rockefeller in Pocantico Hills, New York, Happy married Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who had taken office in 1959 and was eighteen years her senior. She had worked as a member of his office staff until her resignation in 1961. Nelson divorced his first wife, Mary Todhunter Clark, on March 16, 1962. Happy and Nelson Rockefeller had two sons together: Nelson Rockefeller, Jr. (born 1964), and Mark Rockefeller (born 1967).\n\nAt the time, Happy Murphy's relationship with Gov. Rockefeller was controversial. As the British journalist Lady Jeanne Campbell wrote in the London \"Evening Standard\", when the Murphy-Rockefeller involvement became a subject of media scrutiny after the announcement of Rockefeller's filing for divorce from his first wife and Happy Murphy's resignation from his staff, \"Already people are comparing Happy Murphy to the Duchess of Windsor when she was plain Mrs. Simpson.\" More damaging still was the political fallout for Rockefeller. Echoing the party-wide concerns, an official of the Michigan Republican Party told \"The New York Times\" that the couple's potential marriage likely would cost Rockefeller the 1964 presidential nomination. \"The rapidity of it all—he gets a divorce, she gets a divorce—and the indication of the break-up of two homes. Our country doesn't like broken homes.\"\n\nDespite some people's disapproval, Rockefeller was re-elected as governor twice more and served until 1973, when he resigned. He was appointed Vice President of the United States by President Gerald Ford, after Richard Nixon resigned, and served from 1974 to 1977.\n\nThere has been speculation surrounding Malinda Fitler Murphy, the youngest daughter of Happy Rockefeller and Dr. James Slater Murphy, with many in the Rockefeller inner circle believing her to be Nelson Rockefeller's daughter. In his diary, Rockefeller intimate Ken Riland used a tone of knowing irony when mentioning Malinda, putting the word stepfather in quotes. Ellen, the wife of Wally Harrison, the architect and Nelson Rockefeller confidant, claimed that Malinda's parentage was an open secret among Rockefeller associates.\n\nHappy Rockefeller served as the chairman of the board for the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in 1971. She was appointed as a public delegate to the United Nations by President George H. W. Bush in 1991.\n\nShe was a breast cancer survivor, having undergone a double mastectomy in 1974, two weeks after Betty Ford, then First Lady of the United States, underwent a single mastectomy. Happy Rockefeller died following a short illness on May 19, 2015, at the age of 88.\n\n"}

Records show that when twenty-one years old, he assisted a company of wounded soldiers from Quebec to Boston in the winter of 1759–60, and after that duty returned to civilian life. Henry married his cousin Abigail on May 1, 1760, a week before her fifteenth birthday. They had six children, all born in Kent, New York (then known as Fredericksburgh). Lewis was youngest, born on June 25, 1786. His eldest sister was Sybil Ludington.\n\nLudington was twenty when he partnered with his elder brother Frederick to operate a general merchandising store near their home in Kent, New York. He visited Milwaukee in 1838 with his nephew Harrison Ludington and Harvey Birchard of Carmel, New York. They explored the interior of Wisconsin with the idea of purchasing extensive tracts of land from the government for timber. In 1839 the brothers formed a general merchandising store in Milwaukee called Ludington, Burchard & Company. A year or so later Burchard retired and the firm became Ludington and Company with Harrison's younger brother Nelson being brought into the partnership. Ludington was the general manager of the company for nearly twenty years. It had a more wide-ranging business compared to other companies in Wisconsin at the time; among its holdings and activities were docks in Milwaukee and lumber mills in Oconto as part of the firm.\n\nLudington also became involved in real estate development in Wisconsin. His connections there were extensive, and he would travel to the state on the schooner \"Lewis Ludington\", which he used to transport harvested lumber across Lake Michigan from Wisconsin and ultimately back to New York state by train and wagon.\n\nLudington acquired a section of land in Columbus County, Wisconsin Territory sometime in 1838. He sold a portion of it to Elbert Dickason in 1839 on a land contract. Dickason built a cabin on this land acreage on the west side of Crawfish River and dammed up the river for a sawmill site. He became the first settler to locate in this area, when he brought with him a herd of cattle, some horses, and a few wagons of supplies with hired men. The first winter Dickason spent at this site was severe, as most of his live stock died and he almost ran out of food. In spite of his bad luck, he persisted for the next four years, struggling to complete his log cabin and sawmill operation. He spent nearly ten thousand dollars doing so. However, he was unable to make enough money from the sawmill to meet his payments to Ludington and lost all his rights to the property. Ludington took back the property for the back payments and a $200 buy-out. \n\nThere was one other log cabin constructed on this property by Hiram Allen in 1843 not far from the sawmill. Jeremiah Drake became the local real estate agent managing the property in Wisconsin for Ludington, whose home was in New York state. Drake built the first frame house on the property in the early part of 1844. Other settlers that arrived were James Shackley, S. W. St. John, T. Baldwin, H. W. McCafferty, H. A. Whitney, Jacob Smith, James T. Lewis, J. C. Axtell, D. E. Bassett, J. E. Arnold, Warren Loomis, W. C. Spencer, Jesse Rowell, E. Thayer, and W. M. Clark. \n\nIn July 1844, Ludington designed a community layout for this land that became the basic city plan of Columbus, Wisconsin. Ludington's Plat was the first official evidence of the existence of the city of Columbus. Lewis recorded in Brown County, Wisconsin, on November 11, 1844, Ludington's Plat containing Blocks 1 to 9. The school within Ludington's Plat was built in 1846. Columbia County was formed in 1847 from Brown County. There was a Ludington's Addition of Blocks 10 to 13 recorded in Columbia County on August 6, 1849. Ludington made a second addition to the original Ludington's Plat, and it was recorded in the Recorder's office in Portage on October 3, 1850. He deeded some of this land to the Congregationalists later in 1850 and they built a church on it. By the next year they also built a Methodist church and a Universalist church. \n\nLudington, with his son James, helped pioneers to settle and develop the new city of Columbus. They assisted H. W. McCafferty in 1855 in building the Columbus Exchange Hotel that was located in downtown Columbus at the corner of James Street and Ludington Street. They also helped businessmen A. P. Birdsey, Isaac Robinson, R. Thomas, J. Colville, Franklin F. Fowler and B.F. Hart establish firms in the city. The plat of West Columbus was recorded in the Recorder's office in Volume 10 of Deeds (pages 107 and 208) on June 10, 1854. Lewis' First Addition to West Columbus was recorded in Volume 17 of Deeds (page 324) on August 8, 1856. Ludington himself never resided in the state of Wisconsin, despite his many contributions to the state.\n\nLudington married Mary (Polly) Townsend in September, 1812. Their children were Laura, Delia, William, Robert, Charles, Henry, James, Lavinia, Emily, and Amelia.\n\nLudington, while a resident of Carmel, New York, died while on a temporary stay at Keshena, Wisconsin. He was 71 years old, dying on September 10, 1857.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33335427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33335427", "title": "Likert's management systems", "text": "Likert's management systems\n\nLikert’s management systems are management styles developed by Rensis Likert in the 1960s. He outlined four systems of management to describe the relationship, involvement, and roles of managers and subordinates in industrial settings. He based the systems on studies of highly productive supervisors and their team members of an American Insurance Company. Later, he and Jane G. Likert revised the systems to apply to educational settings. They initially intended to spell out the roles of principals, students, and teachers; eventually others such as superintendents, administrators, and parents were included. The management systems, established by Likert, include \"Exploitative Authoritative (System I), Benevolent Authoritative (System II), Consultative (System III), and Participative (System IV).\"\n\nIn the exploitative authoritative system, leaders have a low concern for people and use methods such as threats and other fear-based methods to get their workers to conform. As a result of these methods, employees immediately have excellent performance upon entering the organization. Often times negative feelings are to follow once they settle in. Communication is entirely downwards and psychological concerns of people are ignored. Lateral interaction or teamwork between subordinates lacks in this system based on managerial interactions. Employees are expected to exceed their specified work hours creating negative work environments in organizations. Upper management forces a large work load on employees, however wages, monetary benefits and work satisfaction do not accompany the work. Workers are often found highly demotivated due to exploitation by management. Management does not trust employees, therefore they are not part of decision making processes.\n\nThe benevolent authoritative system uses less control over employees than the exploitative authoritative system, however, this system motivates employees through potential punishment and rewards. Lower-level employees are more involved in the decision making processes, but are still limited by upper management. Employees in this system are involved in policy-making and group problem solving. Major policy decisions are left to those at the top, who have awareness of the problems that occur at both upper and lower levels throughout the organization. This results in mostly downward communication from supervisors to employees. Little upward communication occurs, causing subordinates to be somewhat suspicious of communication coming from the top. The upper management tends to control the way employees can communicate to others and how they make decisions. This contrast in feelings toward responsibility can result in conflict, which can create negative attitudes within the organization. Subordinates in this system can become hostile towards each other because of the competition that is created between them. Satisfaction among workers is low to moderately-low and productivity is measured at fair to good.\n\nThe consultative system is very closely related to the human-relations theory. Subordinates gain motivation through rewards, occasional punishments, and little involvement in making decisions and setting goals. When compared to the first two systems, employees have more freedom to communicate and make company decisions. Lower-level employees have the freedom to make specific decisions that will affect their work. Upper-management still has control over policies and general decisions that affect an organization. Managers talk to their subordinates about problems and action plans before they set organizational goals. Communication in this system flows both downward and upward, though upward is more limited. This promotes a more positive effect on employee relationships and allows for more cooperation. As a result, upper-level managers make company decisions with consideration for input from subordinates. Lower-level employees are seen as consultants to previous decisions and are more willing to accept change because of their involvement in major decisions. Satisfaction in this system improves from benevolent authoritative as does productivity.\n\nThe participative system promotes genuine participation in decision-making and goal setting in order to promote a workplace where all members equally share information. Likert argues that the participative system is the most effective form of management within the systems. This system also coincides with human-resources theory based on the level of lateral interaction between employees and managers. Managers recognize problems that occur when there is little cohesiveness between members of an organization. Free-flowing lateral communication and the use of creativity and skills allows workers to become more involved within the organization. Organizational goals are accepted universally in this system because all individuals are actively involved in their creation. All employees have a high level of responsibility and accountability for these goals. Managers motivate employees through a system that produces monetary awards, participation in goal setting, and trust from management. Management also encourages employees to get involved outside of their occupational role and create relationships with employees of all levels in the organization. Commonly managers are more open minded and creative in comparison to systems I-III. The participative system creates identification with the organization, satisfaction, and higher production among employees when compared to the previous three systems.\n"}

That article did not specifically use the term \"spatial mismatch\", and Kain disclaimed credit. \n\nIn 1987, William Julius Wilson was an important exponent, elaborating the role of economic restructuring, as well as the departure of the black middle-class, in the development of a ghetto underclass in the United States.\n\nAfter World War I, many wealthy Americans started decentralizing out of the cities and into the suburbs. During the second half of the 20th century, department stores followed the trend of moving into the suburbs. In 1968, Kain formulated the “Spatial Mismatch Hypothesis”, but he did not refer to it by this term. His hypothesis was that black workers reside in segregated zones that are distant and poorly connected to major centers of growth. The phenomenon has many implications for inner-city residents dependent on low-level entry jobs. For example, distance from work centers can lead to increasing unemployment rates and further dampen poverty outcomes for the region at large.\n\nIn 2007, Laurent Gobillon, Harris Selod, and Yves Zenou suggested that there are seven different factors that support the spatial mismatch phenomenon. Four factors are attributed to potential workers accessibility and initiatives. The remaining three factors stress employers' reluctance to divert away from the negative stigma of city people and in particular minorities when hiring.\n\n\nGrowth of ghost cities in China, mostly from not yet agglomerated areas between or adjacent metropolitan areas or coal mining towns, as in the case of the most famous example, Kangbashi New Area of Ordos, are an example of spatial mismatch. In the case of places near metropolitan areas, it represents less of a risk going forward than in mining areas.\n\n"}

It was released for Microsoft Windows in May 2014, with versions for Linux, OS X and Xbox 360 released later in 2014 as well as versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One released in April 2015 and May 2016 respectively.\n\nFor the first time in the Tropico series the game features cooperative and competitive multiplayer for up to four players. The players are able to build cities on the same island, allowing the choice of working with one another, or against.\n\nThere are a number of additions to the \"Tropico 5\" game mechanics from the previous iteration of the series, notably the ability to advance to a new era if certain requirements are met; such as having written the constitution of Tropico. Tropico 5 includes 4 different eras, starting from Colonial Era, World Wars, Cold Wars and progressing up to Modern Times which allows progress from the 19th to the 21st century. Another gameplay mechanic is 'El Presidente' now has a dynastic family which will be present on the island. The trading, research, renovation and exploration features have also been overhauled. With multiplayer, diplomacy allows the players to share resources, construction workers, and electricity. Additionally, they are able to help each other with cash. Finally, players are able to compete and even declare war on each other.\n\nAccording to series producer Bisser Dyankov, Tropico 5 is designed to be much denser than its predecessors. The citizens are the lifeblood of the island to grow the island empire and for the sustainable growth, the players need to make them happy. Due to the needs of the 10 different in-game factions, one man's happiness may be another man's frustration. And their allegiances may change depending on the sort of government you run or the buildings you build. Due to the constitutional changes, some of the faction happiness may drop or rise depending on their allegiance to their factions.\n\n\"Tropico 5\", in the base game, comes with 15 missions, split into two parts. In both parts, you advance through all of the four eras, completing various objectives with one final objective for each mission.\n\nIn the first part of the game, Tropico must declare independence from the Crown, a spin on the British Empire. The player is also introduced to the campaign's primary antagonist, Leon Kane, the leader of The Order. Once the island has gained its independence (and thus ending the Colonial Era), the player, represented by \"El Presidente\" and his dynasty, must win three bets against the US President to befriend him; at the same time, a real estate tax must be paid continuously to the Crown. In the next mission, the island must build and maintain a large army in order to fend off a pending invasion. Once the invasion is defeated, the player must accrue a large sum in their Swiss Bank Account in order to purchase Switzerland and get \"Dr. Zweistein\" onto the island. This leads onto a demonstration of the tourism mechanic, in which the player is tasked with paying fees to The Order while, at the same time, trying to get enough tourists onto the island. Once that is accomplished, the player must build a Nuclear Program building to avoid World War III. Then, the island must produce and export Uranium for The Order, while at the same time, stopping the protests and increasing strikes from destroying the economy. At the end of this mission, Kane's plan is revealed: he wants to use the uranium to build enough nuclear missiles and launch an attack on the entire world, killing most of the population. The player must then generate enough research points to build a time machine (thanks to Zweistein from earlier) and travel back in time, thus beginning part two and averting the nuclear war.\n\nIn the second part, Tropico must produce and export gold to the Pirate King in order to free the King's son, for the Crown, all while dealing with constant pirate attacks. The next mission has the player exporting food to the King. After this, the island must amass a fortune high enough to become the richest country in the Caribbean. Once this has been done, the second military-themed mission has the player building a large army, not to defend, but to invade the island of \"Cayo de Fortuna\". The location of Kane is discovered, before he has the opportunity to start a nuclear war, and the player must complete a variety of tasks that help to assassinate him. After this has been completed, Tropico must export resources in order to dissolve the USSR, and then bring all the modern superpowers together and dealing with constant military threats to end the campaign.\n\nIn the game's sandbox mode, the player has a choice between choosing a pre-generated island provided by the developers or from the Steam Workshop, or they may generate a new, random island with a variety of options. Once their island has been created, they work through all the ages, receiving small and large tasks alike to help them advance through the ages and build a stable island. Each of the eras are endless, and may be progressed to whenever the player would like, by completing each of the three main tasks that are given at the end of the first three eras.\n\nAs leader, players can decide their country's independence and write a full constitution.\n\n\"Tropico 5\" was made available for pre-purchase on Steam on 17 April 2014.\n\nThe game was banned in Thailand by the National Council for Peace and Order. The country's military junta government said that the game's storyline \"might affect peace and order in the country.\" The game's distributor in Thailand, New Era Thailand, explained that \"In the fifth installment, the storyline has developed further and there might be some part of it that's not appropriate in the current situation [in Thailand].\"\n\nThe game's \"Complete Edition\", which includes all the released downloadable content and expansion packs (\"Espionage\" and \"Waterborne\"), was released digitally on 29 January 2016.\n\nThe game forumers discovered that the vanilla games have the working models inside the game which are later sold and \"unlocked\" in the DLC.\n\"Tropico 5\" received somewhat positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the PC version 75/100 based on 51 reviews, respectively.\n\n"}

One or more SIC codes can be attributed to a business. SIC codes identify what a business does.\n\nOver time there have been several different SIC systems used in the UK, with versions published in 1958, 1968, 1980, 1992, 1997, 2003 and 2007. These taxonomies have been adapted to cope with the changes in UK industry, The 1980 system was far more detailed in manufacturing, while the 2007 system is much stronger in the IT sector. Many companies still use the 2003 codes which were the 1992 system updated slightly. However, the very latest version is the 2007 SIC system\n\nA Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was first introduced into the United Kingdom in 1948 for use in classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged. The classification provides a framework for the collection, tabulation, presentation and analysis of data and its use promotes uniformity. In addition, it can be used for administration purposes and by non-government bodies as a convenient way of classifying industrial activities into a common structure.\n\nThese now fall in line with the European Union industrial classification system, NACE, and the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classifications, ISIC, to and including the 4 digit class level. For certain classes in the UK SIC 2007 taxonomy a further breakdown to a 5 digit level is available.

Vytex NRL is an alternative material to petroleum-based synthetics and traditional, or Hevea, natural rubber latex. Protein test results show that Vytex NRL typically has 90% fewer antigenic proteins than Hevea natural rubber latex.\n\nPhysical properties of Vytex include barrier protection, elasticity, tactile sensitivity, strength, comfort and fit. Vytex comes in two grades: Vytex high ammonia (Vytex HA) for surgical, exam and rubber gloves, catheters and balloons, and Vytex low ammonia (Vytex LA) for adhesive and foam applications. \n\nIn May 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted 510(k) clearance to market and sell a condom made with Vytex that contains less than 2 μg/dm of antigenic proteins. \n\nVytex was created in 2005 by a global team of scientists including Travis Honeycutt, who holds more than 100 patents. Vystar holds two U.S. patents, an additional pending application, and multiple international patent filings for Vytex NRL.\n\nVytex is produced by Revertex Malaysia and distributed by Centrotrade Minerals and Metals, Inc.\n\nIn May 2018, Vystar acquired the assets of UV Flu Technologies.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, proteins in latex cause a range of allergic reactions. Allergies to latex are most common in healthcare workers, although there is a lack of awareness among nurses that frequent exposure to latex triggers latex allergy.\n\nNatural rubber latex contains over 200 proteins, similar to other natural plant materials, of which 13 are known allergens.[need citation] Vytex NRL is created through a process that significantly reduces these proteins.\n\nVytex Natural Rubber Latex comes from the \"Hevea brasiliensis\" rubber tree, which is primarily cultivated in Southeast Asia. Natural rubber latex is a cloudy white liquid collected by cutting a thin strip of bark from the tree and allowing the latex to be secreted into a collection cup over a period of several hours. After collection, the latex is treated with ammonia to prevent coagulation and is transported to a processing facility for concentrating and compounding. \n\nAluminum hydroxide, an amphoteric protein binding chemical, is added to the latex source material while still in liquid form to complex and remove the antigenic proteins. Alumnium hydroxide can form a jelly-like structure suspending any unwanted materials in water, including bacteria. Under certain conditions, it produces protein complexes that are removed from the Vytex NRL solution.\n\nSamples of treated Vytex NRL are subjected to the Modified Lowry ASTM D5712-05 test, used to measure the total extractable proteins in natural rubber latex, and the ELISA Inhibition ASTM D6499-07 test, used to test for antigenic latex proteins. \n\nUn-leached sample films and products made with Vytex NRL have been independently tested for protein levels at three time intervals: immediately after production, after 21 days of storage, and after 6 months of storage.\n\nTest results during all phases of protein testing generated less than 10 ug/dm² of antigenic protein using the ELISA protein test method. Products made from Vytex NRL under similar conditions used for Hevea natural rubber latex production frequently exhibit less than 0.2 ug/dm² of antigenic protein. Overall, Vytex NRL typically has 90% fewer antigenic proteins than Hevea natural rubber latex.\n\n\n"}

The film is a satire on popular fan culture, Hollywood hype, and the advertising industry, which was making millions of dollars off the growing revenue from television ads. It also takes aim at television and the reduction it caused to the size of movie theater audiences in the 1950s. The film was also known as Oh! For a Man! in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin, who also wrote the largely original screenplay, using little more than the title and the character of Rita Marlowe from the successful Broadway play \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" by George Axelrod. The play had run from 1955 to 1956 and also starred Jayne Mansfield as Rita.\n\nIn lieu of a theme song and opening of the movie, Tashlin instead laid traditional opening credits over faux television commercials for products that failed to deliver what they promised.\n\nFrom this comedic segue, the film opens on a writer for television advertising, Rockwell P. Hunter (Tony Randall), who is low on the ladder at the La Salle agency, the company where he works. With the agency set to lose its biggest account – Stay-Put Lipstick – he hatches an idea to get the perfect model and spokeswoman for Stay-Put's new line of lipstick, the famous actress with the \"oh-so-kissable lips\", Rita Marlowe (Jayne Mansfield). \n\nFor Rita to endorse the lipstick, however, Rock has to pretend to be her boyfriend to make her real boyfriend, Bobo Branigansky (Hargitay), the star of a TV Tarzan show, jealous. Bobo leaks the news of Rita's new romance to the tabloids and Rock Hunter is suddenly famous as Marlowe's \"Lover Doll\". Hunter's boss decides to leverage his employee's newfound fame, but when Hunter also gets Marlowe to agree on a television spectacular sponsored by Stay-Put, Hunter becomes the advertising firm's highest-regarded employee. Marlowe, meanwhile, is miserable; she thinks she is falling in love with Hunter, but her one real true love is the man who discovered her, George Schmidlap (Groucho Marx). Not being able to find Schmidlap, she pursues Hunter, though her Secretary \"Vi\" (Joan Blondell) warns her that she is playing a dangerous game. (Ironically, Blondell, who plays Mansfield's frumpy, middle-aged, all-business secretary, was herself a major movie sex symbol some 30 years before, and whose sexuality was one of the first victims of the Hays Code). \n\nHunter soon finds fame to be a double-edged sword, getting him what he wants, but with a price to be paid for that success. Women are crazy about him, and he has no peace of mind. Ultimately, he moves up the ladder at work, becoming company president, only to find it is not what he really wanted. Hunter confesses to his angry fiancée Jenny that he finds himself at the top of the heap without any meaning and she takes him back.\n\nAs Rita Marlowe opens her television spectacular for Stay-Put Lipstick, she is surprised by the appearance of the show's \"surprise\" guest star of (and the first real love of her life), George Schmidlap.\n\nFreed from strain of advertising, Rock and Jenny retire to the country to tend a chicken farm, announcing that he has found the real living end.\n\n\"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" received a nomination for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actor – Musical/Comedy (Tony Randall) and a nomination for the Writers Guild of America, East WGA Award (Screen) for Best Written American Comedy (Frank Tashlin). The character, Rita Marlowe, is based on dumb blond stereotype epitomized by roles performed by Marilyn Monroe at the time. \n\nThe film contains joking references to several of Mansfield's other roles, including \"The Girl Can't Help It\" (1956; also directed by Tashlin), \"Kiss Them for Me\" (1957), and \"The Wayward Bus\" (1957). The book Mansfield reads in the bathtub scene is \"Peyton Place\" (1956) by Grace Metalious, which became a feature film and a popular TV series that is claimed to be the forerunner of primetime soap operas. The buxom characters in the book were claimed to have been inspired by Mansfield.\n\n\"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" is known as Mansfield's \"signature film\", and is in a package called \"The Jayne Mansfield Collection\" along with \"The Girl Can't Help It\" (1956) and \"The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw\" (1958).\n\nIn 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n"}

Initially, the term was used to express the opinion that the Working Group was being used to prop up the stock markets during downturns. Financial writers for British newspapers \"The Observer\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\", along with U.S. Congressman Ron Paul, writers Kevin Phillips (who claims \"no personal firsthand knowledge\" ) and John Crudele, have charged the Working Group with going beyond their legal mandate. Charles Biderman, head of TrimTabs Investment Research, which tracks money flow in the equities market, suspected that following the 2008 financial crisis the Federal Reserve or U.S. government was supporting the stock market. He stated that \"If the money to boost stock prices did not come from the traditional players, it had to have come from somewhere else\" and \"Why not support the stock market as well? Moreover, several officials have suggested the government should support stock prices.\"\n\nIn August 2005, Sprott Asset Management released a report that argued that there is little doubt that the PPT intervened to protect the stock market. However, these articles usually refer to the Working Group using moral suasion to attempt to convince banks to buy stock index futures.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Board member Robert Heller, in the \"Wall Street Journal\", opined that \"Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity, and thereby increasing the danger of inflation, the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market, thereby stabilizing the market as a whole.\" Some mainstream analysts call those claims a conspiracy theory, explaining that such claims are simplistic and unworkable. Author Kevin Phillips wrote in his 2008 book \"Bad Money\" that while he had no interest \"in becoming a conspiracy investigator\", he nevertheless drew the conclusion that \"some kind of high-level decision seems to have been reached in Washington to loosely institutionalize a rescue mechanism for the stock market akin to that pursued...to safeguard major U.S. banks from exposure to domestic and foreign loan and currency crises.\" Phillips infers that the simplest way for the Working Group to intervene in market plunges would be through buying stock market index futures contracts, either in cooperation with major banks or through trading desks at the U.S. Treasury or Federal Reserve.\n\nOn October 6, 2008, the working group issued a statement indicating that it was taking multiple actions available to it in order to attempt to stabilize the financial system, although purchase of stock shares was not part of the statement. The government may wind up owning shares in the firms to which it provided loans, as they will receive warrants as collateral for these loans.\n\n\n"}
