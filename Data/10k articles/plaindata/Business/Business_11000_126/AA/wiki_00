{"id": "1180879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1180879", "title": "Audit committee", "text": "Audit committee\n\nIn a U.S. publicly traded company, an audit committee is an operating committee of the board of directors charged with oversight of financial reporting and disclosure. Committee members are drawn from members of the company's board of directors, with a Chairperson selected from among the committee members. A qualifying (cf. paragraph \"Composition\" below) audit committee is required for a U.S. publicly traded company to be listed on a stock exchange. Audit committees are typically empowered to acquire the consulting resources and expertise deemed necessary to perform their responsibilities.\n\nThe role of audit committees continues to evolve as a result of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Many audit committees also have oversight of regulatory compliance and risk management activities.\n\nNot for profit entities may also have an audit committee.\n\nInternationally, the audit committee is a committee of the board of directors responsible for oversight of the financial reporting process, selection of the independent auditor, and receipt of audit results both internal and external. The committee assists the board of directors fulfill its corporate governance and overseeing responsibilities in relation to an entity’s financial reporting, internal control system, risk management system and internal and external audit functions. Its role is to provide advice and recommendations to the board within the scope of its terms of reference / charter. Terms of reference and requirements for an audit committee vary by country, but may be influenced by economic and political unions capable of passing legislation. The European Union directives are applied across Europe through legislation at the country level. Although specific legal requirements may vary by country in Europe, the source of legislation on corporate governance issues is often found at the European Union level and within the non-mandatory corporate governance codes that cross national boundaries.\n\n\nIn India, according to Section 177(1) of the Companies Act 2013, the Board of Directors of every listed company and such other class or classes of companies, as may be prescribed, shall constitute an Audit Committee. \n\nAs per Rule 6 (Committees of the Board) of the Companies (Meetings of Board and its Powers) Rules, 2014, the Board of directors of every listed companies and the following classes of companies shall constitute an Audit Committee and a Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board:\n\nAll public companies having:\nUsually, membership of the Committee is subject to the maximum number of 6 persons. \n\nBoards of Directors and their committees rely on management to run the daily operations of the business. The Board's role is better described as oversight or monitoring, rather than execution. Responsibilities of the audit committee typically include:\n\nThe duties of an audit committee are typically described in a committee charter, often available on the entity's website.×\n\n\nAudit committees typically review financial statements quarterly and annually in public companies. In addition, members will often discuss complex accounting estimates and judgments made by management and the implementation of new accounting principles or regulations. Audit committees interact regularly with senior financial management such as the CFO and Controller and are in a position to comment on the capabilities of these managers. Should significant problems with accounting practices or personnel be identified or alleged, a special investigation may be directed by the audit committee, using outside consulting resources as deemed necessary.\n\nExternal auditors are also required to report to the committee on a variety of matters, such as their views on management's selection of accounting principles, accounting adjustments arising from their audits, any disagreement or difficulties encountered in working with management, and any identified fraud or illegal acts.\n\nAudit committees typically approve selection of the external auditor. The external auditor (also called a public accounting firm) reviews the entity's financial statements quarterly and issues an opinion on the accuracy of the entity's annual financial statements. Changing an external auditor typically also requires audit committee approval. Audit committees also help ensure the external auditor is independent, meaning no conflicts of interest exist that might interfere with the auditor's ability to issue its opinion on the financial statements.\n\nAudit committees discuss litigation or regulatory compliance risks with management, generally via briefings or reports of the General Counsel, the top lawyer in the organisation. Larger corporations may also have a Chief Compliance Officer or Ethics Officer that report incidents or risks related to the entity's code of conduct.\n\nInternal control includes the policies and practices used to control the operations, accounting, and regulatory compliance of the entity. Management and both the internal auditing function and external auditors provide reporting to the audit committee regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of internal control.\n\nOrganizations have a variety of functions that perform activities to understand and address risks that threaten the achievement of the organization's objectives. The policies and practices used by the entity to identify, prioritize, and respond to the risks (or opportunities) are typically discussed with the audit committee. Having such a discussion is required for listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Many organizations are developing their practices towards a goal of a risk-based management approach called Enterprise risk management. Audit committee involvement in non-financial risk topics varies significantly by entity. Dr. Ram Charan has argued for risk management early warning systems at the corporate board level.\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 increased audit committees’ responsibilities and authority. It raised membership requirements and committee composition to include more independent directors. Companies were required to disclose whether or not a financial expert is on the Committee. Further, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the stock exchanges proposed new regulations and rules to strengthen audit committees.\n\nBelow are a few key milestones in the evolution of audit committees:\n\n\"The work of the audit committee can only be valuable if sufficient time is allotted on the board agenda for the audit committee to present the results of its work. The audit committee should also feel that the board is taking appropriate action on its report.\"\n\nMany audit committee chairpersons conduct interim calls with key members of management between quarterly meetings. Key contacts may include the CEO, CFO, Chief Auditor, and external audit partner. Many boards also schedule dinners prior to formal meetings that allow informal interaction with management. Some companies also require their boards to spend a certain amount of time learning their operations beyond board meeting attendance.\n\nThese are formally scheduled private meetings between the audit committee and key members of management or the external auditor. These meetings typically are unstructured and provide the opportunity for the committee to obtain the feedback of these managers in private. A key question audit committee members ask in such sessions is: \"Is there anything you would like to bring to our attention?\"\n\nAudit committees should complete a self-evaluation annually to identify improvement opportunities. This involves comparing the committee's performance versus its charter, any formal guidelines and rules, and against best practices. Such a review is confidential and may or may not include evaluations of particular members.\n\nVarious consulting and public accounting firms perform research on audit committees, to provide benchmarking data. Some results are identified below:\n\nIn a 2011 study, the Council of Europe concluded that: \"“The Benchmarking results from a sample of 15 international organisations in Europe show that 11 have an audit committee (of which the name may vary from Audit Committee, Advisory Committee on Audits, Audit Advisory Board, Audit Progress Committee, Finance and Audit Committee, Independent Advisory Oversight Committee, Independent Audit Advisory Committee of Experts) and in seven, the Audit committee plays a role in the selection of the External Auditor\"\".\n\nA 2009 study on 23 international organisations showed that 10 had an Audit Committee and 3 considered having one in future, with 8 reporting to the Governing Body level and 2 reporting to DG/Executive Director level. The sizes of all Audit Committees were between 3 and 9 members, with 5 committees having a mix of external expert members and internal members.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6404397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6404397", "title": "Automotive X Prize", "text": "Automotive X Prize\n\nThe Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE (PIAXP or AXP) was a set of competitions, programs and events, from the X Prize Foundation, to \"inspire a new generation of super-efficient vehicles that help break America's addiction to oil and stem the effects of climate change.\" Progressive Insurance was the title sponsor of the prize, the centerpiece of which is the Competition Division, within which a 10-million-dollar purse was divided between the winners of three competitions.\n\nThe essence of each competition was to design, build and race super-efficient vehicles that achieved 100 MPGe (2.35 liter/100 kilometer) efficiency, produced less than 200 grams/mile well-to-wheel CO equivalent emissions, and could be manufactured for the mass market. Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes: Mainstream and Alternative. The mainstream class had a prize of $5 million. The alternate class had two separate prizes of $2.5 million, one for side-by-side seating and one for tandem seating.\n\nThe PIAXP has an Educational Program, funded by a $3.5 million grant from the United States Department of Energy, to engage students and the public in learning about advanced vehicle technologies, energy efficiency, climate change, alternative fuels, and the science, technology, engineering, and math behind efficient vehicle development.\n\nThe X Prize Foundation began work on the development of a competition to spur innovation in the automotive industry in 2005 and on 6 March 2006 announced that Mark Goodstein would join the Foundation as an Executive Director of the new prize.\n\nAt the 12 April 2007 announcement of the creation of the X Prize, the Foundation released draft Competition Guidelines, which were open for public comment from 2 April to 31 May 2007. The latest guidelines were published on 10 January 2009. The competition guidelines are the product of hundreds of volunteers of the AXP and world-class advisors.\n\nOn 7 April 2009, the X Prize Foundation announced that 111 teams had registered by the February 2009 deadline. By 20 October 2009, the design judging had winnowed the number of teams down to 43, with some publicly, and others quietly, withdrawing. The formal vehicle competition events began on 26 April 2010, and consisted of the remaining four stages: Shakedown (26 April – 7 May 2010), Knockout ( 16–30 June 2010), Finals ( 19–30 July 2010) and Validation (August 2010).\n\nThe winners of the competition were announced on 16 September 2010.\n\nWithin the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes—Mainstream and Alternative—both of which have the same requirements for fuel economy and emissions, but differing design constraints. The Alternative class is further divided into tandem and side-by-side classes. Vehicles in the Mainstream Class must meet specifications that are derived from typical small, five-passenger, economy mixed-use vehicles. The Alternative Class has fewer performance and design restrictions and provides an outlet for innovation. Both classes allow entries that are modifications of an existing popular vehicle, provided that all PIAXP requirements are met.\n\nVehicles in both classes must have a fuel economy of 100 MPGe (21 kWh or 2.35 liters of petrol/100 kilometer) and produce less than 200 grams/mile CO emissions (measured well-to-wheel). For electric vehicles, the CO emissions requirement is a more binding constraint. Because CO emissions will be calculated assuming a national average of electricity sources projected to 2014, an all-electric car will have to achieve 114 MPGe in order to produce less than 200 grams/mile CO emissions. Further, electricity consumption is measured at the \"plug\" side of the battery charging device, so it would have to achieve 114 MPGe, assuming 100% efficient battery charging. If the charger were 85% efficient, this requirement would grow to 134 MPGe. In the other words, efficiency of electric cars should be not 21 but 16 kWh/100 km.\n\nVehicles in both classes also must have features expected of a modern automobile including an enclosed cabin with windshield and windows, operating windshield wipers, washers, headlights, horn, indicators, brake lights, reflective devices, rear and side-view mirrors, and seat belts. They must have the usual automotive controls, including accelerator pedal, brake pedal, steering mechanism (not necessarily a wheel) and indicators. They must be \"highway capable\", which is defined as the ability to maintain on a four percent uphill grade and to accelerate from to in less than 9 seconds. They must be able to brake from 60 to 0 mph in less than , meet existing noise standards and use tires that meet automotive or motorcycle (alternative class only and only if the vehicle is otherwise eligible to be classified as a motorcycle) standards. Both must meet the same set of static and dynamic stability requirements.\n\nThe mainstream vehicle must seat at least four adults with at least two side-by-side front seats, have at least of useful cargo space in one contiguous location not counting the passenger seats, accelerate from 0 to in 15 seconds or less, and be able to drive without refueling or recharging. The mainstream vehicle must have four or more wheels.\n\nThe alternate class vehicle must seat at least two people, accelerate from 0 to in 18 seconds or less, and be able to drive without refueling or recharging. The alternative vehicle has no minimum number of wheels, but it must remain upright when stopped with no driver inputs.\n\nWhile the main focus of PIAXP is fuel economy and carbon emissions, not safety, the vehicles must be \"production capable\". Therefore, the entries must either be fully compliant with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and other applicable National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) requirements or compliance has to be \"designed in\". For example, allowance for airbags in the designs is considered acceptable without actually installing the airbags. Teams are also required to submit a business plan which clearly demonstrates an ability to produce 10,000 vehicles per year. Note that teams are not required to be under-taking this plan, but the plan has to exist and the car has to be designed such that this plan is feasible.\n\nWith the lack of mainstream entrants from established automobile companies, a Demonstration Division was created so that automakers could at least display and promote their highest efficiency vehicles alongside the main competition. However, there were too few entrants by 1 March registration deadline, and this division was canceled. The only confirmed entrant was the Tesla Roadster, which had dropped out of the main competition.\n\nVehicles in the Demonstration Division would have met the same requirements as Mainstream Class vehicles in the Competition Division, except for MPGe and CO emissions. There was no Alternative Class equivalent in the Demonstration Division. These vehicles would have been stock vehicles, i.e., vehicles identical to those for sale or pre-production prototypes of vehicles intended for sales.\n\nVehicles in the Demonstration Division would have been tested in the same way as Competition Division vehicles and would have participated in the PIAXP competition events under the same rules in order to demonstrate and showcase their capabilities and performance.\n\nThe competition timeline was finalized as follows:\n\nAccepted teams must provide evidence that their vehicles are production capable, by providing a detailed Data Submissions covering four areas:\n\n\nThose that pass this hurdle will be invited to bring their vehicles to the competition events. The design judging was closed in October 2009, with 43 teams remaining.\n\nThe first three stages will be a “shake-down” period and performance in these stages will not count to final scores. The first step of the competition will be the review of technical reports, technical inspection of the vehicles and performance testing of safety elements to eliminate unsafe vehicles. The two-week shakedown took place at the Michigan International Speedway, from 26 April to 7 May 2010.\n\nThose that pass the initial technical and safety inspections and tests will participate in the remaining competition events. These include stage races, additional active safety performance tests and a dynamometer test.\n\nThe next stage will be a “knockout” qualifying event. To advance, vehicles must pass active safety performance tests, meet acceptable emission levels and demonstrate at least 67 MPGe on a test track. These were held at the Michigan International Speedway from 20–29 June 2010. After this stage, only 15 vehicles from 12 teams remained in the competition.\n\nThe final stages will determine the winning teams. To complete the race successfully, vehicles must maintain a minimum average speed (maximum allowable time) while meeting PIAXP requirements for fuel economy (90 MPGe) and emissions. The finals also include a tie breaking race; the vehicle with the best overall time while still meeting requirements will take the purse. The final stages are scheduled for 19–30 July 2010 at the Michigan International Speedway.\n\nThe few remaining teams were validated on dynamometers under laboratory conditions at the EPA Labs in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, Illinois. This stage is scheduled for August 2010. The validation results count toward 50% of the final efficiency figures, which together must exceed 100 MPGe.\n\nEdison2 was an exception. The engines in both Very Light Cars failed before validation. Edison2 was allowed to circumvent the rules governing procedures and provided independent third-party validation reports instead of undergoing the same validation testing as other finalist teams.\n\nThe United States Department of Energy joined the PIAXP as a sponsor, funding an educational program targeted to young people. The first component of the Education Program is a web site created in partnership with Discovery Education, www.FuelOurFutureNow.com, featuring activities for K-12 students, as well as videos, virtual labs, and interactive resources intended for use in school and in the home.\n\nAlthough 111 teams registered for the PAIXP and paid the registration fee,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

BAI's mission is created on the belief that a strong financial services industry helps consumers, businesses, and communities thrive.\n\nBAI's members include national and global banks, credit unions, mortgage and auto loan providers, money service businesses, and larger lending institutions. In 2016, over 250,000 financial services individuals at more than 1,500 financial services organizations took compliance and professional training courses through BAI.\n\nIn 1924, several representatives of regional auditors' groups met to discuss issues in the auditing industry. Later that same year they created a national organization—the National Association of Bank Auditors and Controllers (NABAC) —and began to hold annual conventions and distribute a magazine focused on financial industry topics.\n\nIn the 1940s, the NABAC established its own office—first in Cleveland and later in Chicago. And the organization began to provide both education and technical research for its members. In 1957, the organization set up the NABAC Research Institute as the first official, collective research effort for the banking industry.\n\nIn 1969, NABAC rebranded as Bank Administration Institute (BAI), and had approximately 8,000 member institutions across the U.S.\n\nIn 1981, BAI launched the first electronic information services—Innerline—providing 24-hour access to world news briefs, American Banker news service, financial information on 8,500 publicly held corporations, and email and online registration for BAI conferences.\n\nAs of 1997, BAI co-sponsored with ECCHO (Electronic Check Clearing House Organization) the National Electronic Check and Image Exchange Conference.\n\nIn 2014, BAI recognized 90 years of service to the financial services industry and provided more than 250,000 individuals with compliance and professional training.\n\nBAI is organized into three major divisions: Research, Learning and Development, and Conferences and Events.\n\nBAI's Research division conducts data analysis using account-level data provided from participating financial services organizations. Once data is gathered, the data is then analyzed and compiled using BAI's proprietary database. BAI uses the data in order to present individual organizations with a comparison of their data with the larger peer group of participating organizations. All individual company data is kept confidential, and competitive data is available to participating organizations only in aggregate. As a non-profit organization, BAI does not provide advice or consulting as a part of its research services. Comparative data is presented without additional insight or opinion. BAI Research topics include industry trends, small business banking, retail banking, and commercial banking. Analytics that can be compared include deposit performance, forecasts, market opportunities, and branch performance.\n\nBAI Learning and Development division maintains a software course catalog through BAI's proprietary learning management system, the BAI Learning Manager, which can be accessed and managed by training administrators. The catalog includes more than 250 courses for banks, credit unions, mortgage lenders, and other financial services organizations. Topics cover areas including financial regulations, compliance, professional skills, certifications, and human resources issues. Courses are available from entry to executive level. BAI's course catalog is regularly updated to reflect the latest regulatory trends and issues in compliance and can also be provided to a financial institution's own learning management platform. BAI compliance and professional training can be customized, is updated continually, and is compliant with national regulatory standards.\n\nBAI's Conferences and Events division hosts several industry events with the help of sponsors.

So according to theory we should observe that consumption is much more correlated across countries than output. What Backus, Kehoe and Kydland found in their article from 1992 was the opposite, namely that consumption is much less correlated across countries than output.\n\nBackus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) calculate the correlation of HP-filtered consumption and output for 11 advanced countries relative to the US. The measured average consumption correlation was .19, whereas the average output correlation was .31. Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996) reports average correlation of OECD countries with world consumption (35 “benchmark” countries) of .43, whereas the average OECD country’s output correlation with world benchmark is 0.52. The really puzzling part of these results is not that consumption levels are not perfectly correlated, but that they are less correlated than output. Apparently, there is hardly any risk sharing.\n\nObstfeld and Rogoff (2000) identifies this as one of the six major puzzles in international economics. The others are the home bias in trade puzzle, the equity home bias puzzle, the Feldstein-Horioka savings-investment correlations puzzle, the purchasing power and exchange rate disconnect puzzle, and the Baxter-Stockman neutrality of exchange rate regime puzzle. It is also related to the Backus-Smith consumption-real exchange rate puzzle.\n\nStockman and Tesar (1995) suggests two means of breaking the link between prices and quantities and making it hard for households to smooth consumption by trade. The first is nontraded goods: Suppose households like to consume goods that cannot be traded, like some services. If there is a positive technology shock raising their supply, they can’t smooth their consumption of these goods by exporting them abroad. The second is \"taste shocks\": If consumption rises in one country without any change in the economic environment, it will borrow abroad, driving up the interest rate and inducing the foreign country to cut back on its consumption. So consumption could be negatively correlated across countries.\n"}

His parents separated while he was a young boy; his mother single-handedly raised him, although his father visited the family regularly. He has eight siblings.\n\nHe was fascinated with business at a very young age; as a child he sold indigenous food after school to contribute to the household income while his mother worked as a domestic worker. As with every business, money is the key and the main objective: Whenever he got, he used the change to buy sweets and resold them at school to get more money and increase cash-flow.\n\nAt the age of nine, he started cleaning yards and got paid weekly. This was a great incentive for him but later he realized that the money coming in weekly was not enough to buy enough stock to satisfy the demand for the product (sweets) at school. He arranged to receive the money month-end; that improved the cash-flow and the stock levels. As the cash-flow improved, he bought a bicycle to extend his operations. The bicycle took him three years to pay off.\n\nHis first shop was a cardboard-box in front of his mother's house in the black township, called \"the Location\".\n\nMr Watyako Mumbala from Elim Omunda gwambala he is a founder of Wamu Group of Companies\n\nHauwanga opened his first spares shop in Ongwediva, selling car parts. He grew this business from suppliers in Windhoek and Johannesburg and then to the world. He has several operations around the country and has expanded into neighboring Angola. His operations in Angola are property development; he has completed several projects in Angola.\n\nBenjamin \"BH\" has branches of the BH Group of Companies across Namibia with branches in Kavango, Oshana, Omusati, Khomas and Ohangwena.\n\nBenjamin Hauwanga joins an elite group of Namibian businessmen in owning a private plane. His Beechcraft 55 Baron aircraft is believed to have cost around N$3 million. He says he bought it to improve the logistical dimensions of his business operations. He bought it from Rami Barnes, a South African entrepreneur.\n\nHauwanga is the owner of the Bennies Entertainment Park and Lodge in Ongwediva.\n\nIn 2008, Hauwanga was involved in a legal saga with another prominent businessman, Harold Pupkewitz. The legal showdown that erupted was over money that the BH businesses claim to have lost in non-existent orders and deliveries from Pupkewitz: the amount of money in discussion was N$4 947 250.60. The dispute arose from payments that BH Motor Spares alleges to have made to Pupkewitz for goods that they had neither ordered nor received from the motoring mogul. BH claims that Pupkewitz invoiced and collected money for the orders. The sum of N$4 947 250.60 is accordingly due, owing and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff which sum, the defendant, despite demand, fails and/or refuse to pay to the plaintiff.\n\nHauwanga was represented by Sisa Namandje law firm while Pupkewitz was represented by the Lorentz Hangula Inc. law firm.\n\nIn 2009, BH was also involved in a scandal with the grandson of the former president Sam Nujoma. Joseph Nakanyala, grandson of Nujoma, tried to extort Hauwanga by using Nujoma's cell phone in June purporting to be the former president. In SMSs, Nakanyala threatened to kill Hauwanga if he did not give him money. Nakanyala was caught red-handed by the police while stealing a briefcase with money from Nujoma's residence and he later claimed that Hauwanga had sent him. Through thorough investigations it was concluded that Nakanyala made all the stories up in an attempt to extort Hauwanga. Nakanyala withdrew his claims and publicly apologized to Hauwanga through lawyer Sisa Namandje.\n\nIn a statement signed by Nakanyala, he acknowledged having made these allegations saying: \"I had no basis and right at the time of making such allegations to accuse Mr Benjamin Hauwanga. I acknowledge and recognize that the allegations I made have injured the good reputation and name of Mr Hauwanga, and I unconditionally and unreservedly apologize to him , his family, friends and all those who have been affected and inconvenienced by the false allegations I made\" the statement reads further. The two shook hands and embraced warmly after Nakanyala finished reading his apology.\n\nIn 2011, Hauwanga received an honorary master's degree in Entrepreneurship (honoris causa) from the International University of Management (IUM).\n\nHe received a Junior Achievement Laureate in Business in 2008.\n"}

H. E. Philpin (1985) characterised the debate as 'one of the most important historical debates of recent years'.\n\nThe debate has been seen as a successor to the so-called \"transition debate\" (or Dobb-Sweezy debate) that followed Maurice Dobb's 1946 \"Studies in the Development of Capitalism\", and Paul Sweezy's 1950 article \"The Transition From Feudalism To Capitalism\"), in the journal \"Science & Society\". (These articles were subsequently collected and published as a book, also entitled \"The Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism\", in 1976.\nIt began with Brenner's 1976 article \"Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe\", in the influential historical journal \"Past & Present\".\nBrenner's thesis was the focus of a symposium in around 1977, several contributions to which also appeared in the pages of \"Past & Present\". Brenner's article and the discussions that followed it have a broad significance for understanding the origins of capitalism, and were foundational to so-called \"Political Marxism\".\n\nIn 1978, Michael Postan and John Hatcher characterised the debate as attempting to determine whether Malthusian cyclic explanations of population and development or social class explanations governed demographic and economic change in Europe. The debate challenged the prevalent views of regarding class relations in the economy of England in the Middle Ages in particular – and agricultural societies with serfdom in general, as well as engaging the broader historiography of the economics of feudalism from the 20th century (in both the west and the Soviet Union).\n\nEven though Brenner's key ideas have not achieved consensus, the debate has remained influential in 21st century scholarship,\nIn the view of Shami Ghosh, Brenner's thesis proposed an explanatory framework for the evolution of what he called \"agrarian capitalism\", in England, during the 15th and 16th centuries.[A] transformation of relationships between landlords and cultivators led to the creation of a largely free and competitive market in land and labour, while simultaneously dispossessing most of the peasants. Thus from the old class divisions of owners of land on the one hand, and an unfree peasantry with customary rights of use to land on the other, a new tripartite structure came into being, comprising landlords, free tenant farmers on relatively short-term market-determined leases and wage labourers; this Brenner defines as ‘agrarian capitalism’. Wage labourers were completely market-dependent – a rural proletariat – and tenant farmers had to compete on the land market in order to retain their access to land. This last fact was the principal motor of innovation leading to a rise in productivity, which, coupled with the growth of a now-free labour market, was essential for the development of modern (industrial) capitalism.

It would only begin to experience significant consolidation from 2012 onwards.\n\nAfter some controversy in the first part of the 20th Century, it has been generally agreed that regulation of the Canadian accounting profession falls within provincial jurisdiction over matters of a local and private nature, as well as under the provincial education power with respect to training for achieving such professional qualifications.\n\nDemand for trained accountants arose as early as the 1840s, when the first Canadian professional accounting firms were organized in Toronto and Montreal.\n\nThe Association of Accountants in Montreal was organized as the first accounting organization in North America in 1879 (and only the fifth such organization in the world), and was incorporated by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. Ontario would follow several weeks later with the formation of the Institute of Accountants and Adjusters of Ontario, which was later incorporated as the Institute of Accountants of Ontario in 1883 under the direction of E.R.C. Clarkson, one of the founding members of Clarkson Gordon & Co, and a key member in the growth of the accounting and insolvency consulting industry in Canada. E.R.C. Further acted as a frequent advisor to the Canadian Senate in regard to the banking committee. It was reconstituted as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario (\"ICAO\") in 1911.\n\nAs the AAM tended to have an anglophone membership, the Institute of Accountants and Auditors of the Province of Quebec was later incorporated to service growing demand within Quebec's francophone population. In 1919, the AAM began to offer admission for members of the IAAPQ.\n\nManitoba would be the third province to organize its chartered accountants, and it would later be instrumental in organizing similar professional bodies in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nNova Scotia organized in 1900, followed by New Brunswick in 1916 and Prince Edward Island in 1921. The latter two bodies were organized in an irregular manner compared to those of other provinces, which resulted in their qualifications not being recognized by Nova Scotia until 1925, and by Quebec and Ontario until 1926.\n\nOutside Canada, the Dominion of Newfoundland incorporated the Institute of Accountants in 1905, but was pressured to revoke statutory protection of its designation the following year. This was not reversed until Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949.\n\nTensions erupted following a disciplinary hearing in 1890 held by the Institute of Accountants of Ontario into an audit conducted with respect to Confederation Life. While the action itself affirmed the importance of auditor independence, it caused a rift in the IAO membership and the resignation of several prominent members of the governing Council in 1891.\n\nThe early CA bodies, with the exception of the AAM, also started to relax their entrance requirements to allow the admission of accountants who were not in public practice. An initial effort to create a national organization in 1901 was quashed due to local opposition, but this caused a concerted effort, sponsored by the AAM, to create one that would be restricted to practicing accountants. As a result, the Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants (\"DACA\") was created in 1902, in an attempt to create a national status for the profession through direct entry of qualified applicants to membership.\n\nOntario passed an Act in 1908 granting the ICAO exclusive rights to the CA designation, and, on DACA's petition, the Governor in Council disallowed it in 1909, on grounds of federal paramountcy in having created a national body, as described in a memo by Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Sir Allen Aylesworth recommending the measure. A subsequent 1910 Act was disallowed for similar reasons in 1911. With the mediation of the President of the British Society of Incorporated Accountants at a meeting in Chicago, the ICAO and DACA leaders subsequently reached an agreement in which DACA would be reorganized as a federation of the provincial Institutes effective from 1909. The Act was subsequently passed again in 1911, with a concession granted to accountants who were members of DACA on December 16, 1909.\n\nDACA would become the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1951. It would expand internationally in 1973, when the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bermuda was incorporated and subsequently obtained affiliation with the CICA.\n\nThe creation of large business and governmental organizations increased the demand for accountants on their payrolls, which called for efforts to address their unique needs without the necessity of apprenticeships demanded by the CA firms. The Canadian Association of Accountants was formed in 1908, arising from a technical self-study group of accountants working at the Canadian Pacific Railway, which led to the creation of the General Accountants Association in 1913. Despite initial assurances that its members would refrain from practicing public accounting, it began advertising examinations in that field in 1917, thus triggering conflicts with the CA bodies that would last for decades.\n\nBecause of such protracted opposition, it was only in 1999 that the GAA was able to change its name to the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada. Over the years, portions of its membership would be admitted into membership of other professional bodies, such as the admission into Quebec's Association of Accountants in 1920, the CGA/CA merger in Quebec in 1946, the CGA/CPA merger in 1949, and the CGA/CPA merger in Manitoba in 1950.\n\nTowards the end of the First World War, several significant issues forced organizations to invest resources into the creation of cost accounting functions:\n\nIn a move designed to prevent the newly-created General Accountants Association from moving into that field, DACA created the Canadian Society of Cost Accountants (\"CSCA\"), with membership originally restricted to chartered accountants.\n\nThe CSCA would initiate efforts to standardize education in cost accounting, and entered into an affiliation agreement with the US National Association of Cost Accountants in 1922. When the CSCA tried to obtain NACA's educational materials at a more reasonable cost in 1926, NACA proposed a merger of the two organizations. This was rejected, and the affiliation was subsequently dissolved. The Society began to issue \"Certificates of efficiency\" in 1927 to its graduates.\n\nIn the 1930s, there would be internal tensions as to what areas of company accounting the CSCA should focus on, and, in 1939, members wishing to concentrate more on management accounting left to form the Controllers' Institute of Canada (later part of the Financial Executives Institute).\n\nWhen provincial societies began to be formed in 1941, the \"Registered Industrial and Cost Accountant\" (\"RIA\") was created for its members. This initiative was generally accepted in most provinces, but there was resistance in British Columbia as the promoters of that effort were only CGAs and independent accountants. It would pass only when the enabling Act specified that the RIA designation was available only to those members who were also CAs.\n\nThe designation was simplified as \"Registered Industrial Accountant\" in some, but not all, provinces around 1967. It would be replaced by the Certified Management Accountant (\"CMA\") designation beginning in 1976, but the province-by-province implementation would be completed only in 1985.\n\nThe first Canadian CPA designation arose from several parallel moves:\n\nThe CPAs subsequently gained statutory recognition in most, but not all, provinces. Because of CA opposition in Nova Scotia, it was only able to use the designation of \"Registered Public Accountant\".\n\nThe Quebec CPAs were forced to merge with the ICAPQ in 1946 upon the reorganization of the Quebec profession. In 1962, the CAs and CPAs agreed to merge nationally, and the remaining provincial CPA bodies either dissolved or became dormant.\n\nThe \"International Society of Commerce\" (\"ISC\") was first noted in an advertisement in Hamilton, Ontario, as early as 1921, and its members were conferred with the designation of \"Accredited Public Accountant\" (\"APA\"). The ISC, located in Winnipeg, formed the \"Institute of Accredited Public Accountants\" in 1938, which was federally incorporated in 1946. It initially attempted to organize a provincial institute in British Columbia in 1937, but failed to receive legislative approval.\n\nWhen Quebec consolidated the auditing profession in 1946, APAs in the province who had practiced accounting continuously from 1942 received statutory recognition in Quebec. The APA designation later received statutory protection in New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\n\nAn attempt was made to form a body in Ontario by way of private bill in 1949, but it was withdrawn at second reading on grounds advanced by the CA and CPA bodies that a public bill would be a more appropriate choice for action. That option was never subsequently pursued. Similar efforts to secure recognition in British Columbia and Alberta were also pursued at the time, but they failed as well. Provincial societies were later organized in British Columbia and Ontario in 1957.\n\nThe APAs would later consolidate with other accounting organizations. They merged with the CPAs in New Brunswick in 1952, but other APAs revived the organization in 1961. Later efforts by other provincial bodies to merge with the CGAs proved to be more conclusive. The Ontario society, however, decided in 1963 to restrict its membership to those members who held public accounting licenses. As no future licenses would be conferred on APAs after 1962 as a result of that year's reorganization of the Public Accountants Council, it would gradually cease to exist over time.\n\nWhile the APA designation is not now recognized by any Canadian jurisdiction as a professional designation in active usage, the Canadian Institute of Accredited Public Accountants continues to exist, in alliance with the Society of Professional Accountants of Canada. The SPAC confers the APA designation as an honorary title to Registered Professional Accountants of distinction.\n\nFrom 1946, the chartered accountants took the initiative to codify generally accepted accounting principles and generally accepted auditing standards in Canada:\n\nIn addition to conferring exclusive rights to use specified designations on the members of the various professional bodies, most provinces have also required those who pursued public accounting to obtain a separate permit. The permit is issued by:\n\n\nThe various provincial bodies were federated nationally in the following bodies:\n\nAfter a failed merger attempt in 2004, the CAs and CMAs began new discussions in 2011, and invited the CGAs to participate. While the three national bodies supported merger discussions, there was significant tension among their memberships, notably within the CAs, and at one point the CGAs and CMAs in Ontario withdrew from talks because of concerns over the potential loss of their identity. Proponents of the proposal argued that it would strengthen the influence, relevance and contribution of the Canadian accounting profession with domestic and international stakeholders and serve the public interest through common codes of conduct, disciplinary systems and licensing regimes.\n\nQuebec would be the first province to consolidate the profession in 2012. This triggered a succession of similar moves in other jurisdictions, which became functionally complete in 2014 with CPA Canada as the umbrella organization, but would be formally completed only in 2018:\n\nFederal recognition of the merger involved the amendment of various Acts to reflect the change of designation:\n\nIn addition to preserving the legacy CA, CGA and CMA professional designations (and thus barring them from use by other accountants), the following are also protected:\n\nIn addition, Yukon and British Columbia have several other protected designations in use:\n\nYukon also grants an honorary designation known as \"CPA (Hon)\".\n\nAlberta has opted to allow all those with legacy designations to use them in conjunction with \"CPA\" during the first 10 years from July 1, 2015, or to use the legacy designation alone during that time. After the 10-year transition period, the \"CPA\" designation can be used on its own by such legacy holders.\n\nDuring the years running up to the 2012-2018 consolidation, as well as thereafter, there has been debate as to the practical impact of the merger.\n\nThe 2010-2011 CA/CMA position paper on the proposed merger gave five reasons why it should be pursued:\n\n\nThere was significant resistance by the CA membership at the time, who were concerned that their collective image would be diminished as a result.\n\nFollowing the consolidation, the following observations have been made:\n\n\nAs possession of a Canadian professional accounting designation is not generally a mandatory requirement to hold a Canadian financial position, other professional bodies have members who also work in Canada, of which the most significant are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company at one time did most of its business in agriculture including becoming, through mergers the modern Dole Food Company, the world's largest producer of fruits and vegetables. In 1996 it was spun off from Dole and today most of the company's business is in real estate and residential, commercial, and retail development.\n\nCastle & Cooke was founded in 1851 as a partnership between Samuel Northrup Castle and Amos Starr Cooke as a department store that sold farm tools, sewing equipment, and medicine. Joseph Ballard Atherton joined as clerk in 1858 and rose to become partner by 1865. Over the next few decades, the company invested heavily in Hawaii's sugar industry, running plantations in Kohala and Haiku. Atherton became president after the deaths of Cooke in 1871 and Castle in 1894, when the company incorporated. After the death of Atherton, George Parmele Castle (1851–1932) became president. G.P. Castle retired in 1916 and Edward Davies Tenney became chairman.\n\nIn the 1910s, the company, along with three other Big Five companies, invested in Matson Navigation Company. Tenney became president of Matson after William Matson's death. In 1931, the company also bought a 21 percent share of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, which was later renamed the Dole Food Company. After the death of Tenney, Alexander G. Budge became president in 1935.\nCastle & Cooke bought the remaining shares of Dole in 1961.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1968, Castle & Cooke acquired the Standard Fruit Company, adding bananas and other tropical fruits to its existing pineapple operations. In 1976, it acquired Bud Antle Inc., a California-based lettuce and celery farmer; it was renamed Dole Fresh Vegetables in 1989.\n\nThe company maintained Dole's large pineapple plantations throughout the state, including a particularly large one on the island of Lanai, where Castle & Cooke owned about 95 percent of the island.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Castle & Cooke began to face severe financial trouble as Hawaii's agriculture industry weakened. In 1985, the company merged with the Flexi-Van Corporation, a transportation leasing company. In 1991, the company was renamed Dole Food Company.\n\nIn 1995, the real estate operations of The Dole Food Company were spun off as the newly reformed company Castle & Cooke. The new Castle & Cooke was bought by Dole CEO, David H. Murdock, who remains the CEO of Castle & Cooke today.\n\nOn May 2, 2012 (made public in June), Oracle Corp. CEO Larry Ellison signed an agreement to buy most of the 6th largest Hawaiian island of Lanai from Castle & Cooke for $300 million.\n\nIn April 2016, their project in Koa Ridge that had faced extensive delays was approved by the Hawaii State Supreme Court. The project aims to build 3,500 homes, which were initially valued at $300,000 each. Construction is set to begin in 2017. \n\n\n"}

While FCC originated with a small circle of business and ministry leaders in the 1970s in Atlanta, Georgia, US, FCCI now reports activities in over 100 nations, as of 12/2015.\n\n\"The Fellowship of Companies for Christ International aims higher than your basic business-networking organization. It's a group that supplies spiritual inspiration and guidance for born-again-Christian CEOs\"—Inc. Magazine\n\nFellowship of Companies for Christ International equips and encourages company leaders to operate their businesses and conduct their personal lives according to Biblical principles. For over 35 years, as a cross-denominational group, FCCI has been exploring the question: \"What does it mean to run a company for Christ?\" FCCI is now a global fellowship with a local vision, focused on personal, business and community transformation through a growing relationship with Christ, believing that Christ can change the world through how members do business.\n\nBiblical mandate--FCCI embraces the discipleship of leaders and nations as described in Great Commission. FCCI's Vision is unique as it focuses on leaders' transformation impacting their personal lives, leadership styles, and business cultures that can lead to a transformation of their community, city and their respective nations. --\"Transforming the world through Christ, one business leader at a time.\"\n\nLong before What Would Jesus Do?-WWJD wristbands appeared in the 1990s, in the 1970s FCCI's founding circles wrestled with the question: \"What would Jesus do--if He were running my company?\" This question was penned by Charles Sheldon in 1896 in a series of articles that became the book In His Steps\n\nFCCI is part of a revival of interest on matters of faith, expressly discussed in workplaces, including prayer, study and discussion groups in break rooms, conference rooms and dedicated spaces allowing free expression of faith, in compliance with Title 7 requirements.\n\nFCCI sees business as a bridge to reach the world for Christ by allowing clients, employees, leaders, competitors and stakeholders to experience the blessings that come with alignment to Biblical principles. A company's culture is positively impacted by an outflowing of the Abundant Life experienced by its leader. When a city, region or nation has enough leaders and businesses in alignment with Biblical principles, cultures can change through how business is done. FCCI promotes a purposeful strategy to positively impact the cultural hub cities around the world, expressed in the Influential Cities Outreach.\n\nFCCI supports a broader movement of Fortune 500 Companies to proprietorships that allow free expression of faith within the (US Federal law)Title 7 context. FCCI estimated the number of workplace study and prayer groups was around 10,000.\n\nOperating as a 501c3 non-profit sustainable through membership and donations, FCCI produces an annual international conference drawing Christian business leaders from dozens of countries. Speakers address issues common to all business owners and leaders from a Biblical perspective. Live conference sessions are streamed from the conference around the world and video is captured, segmented and uploaded for ongoing use in Business Leadership Groups in the USA and other nations. The International Conference is a source of watershed moments for attendees, sometimes provoking transformational change in their personal or business lives The FCCI conference has also exhibited a catalytic effect, sometimes inspiring spinoffs when attendees return home.\n\nFCCI Business Leadership Groups [BLGs] convene weekly or monthly for fellowship, encouragement, prayer, counsel and Godly wisdom. Business issues are discussed in the groups from a biblical perspective which considers the impact on both relationships and resources.\n\nConcepts of Biblical stewardship are promoted to FCCI's membership and modeled by the organization, a founding member of the Evangelical Counsel for Financial Accountability ECFA FCCI promotes the Biblical concepts that our purpose in work: 1. is of utmost importance to God and 2. is key to eternal reward (Col 3:17, 23-24). Business as Missions and Business as Ministry is most effective when Eternal Purpose is clearly understood, Eternal Values are clearly communicated, taught and most importantly, modeled by business leaders. The preeminence of eternal purpose is central to all of FCCI's activities. This idea is reinforced by the name given to FCCI's process for developing leaders-Pathway to Purpose.\nFCCI provivdes ongoing prayer support for CEOs, business leaders, their employees and others through a through a web-facilitated network of volunteers.\n\nFCCI's global fellowship is served by a small team of employees, supporting a cadre of distinguished volunteers leading Business Leadership Groups and Area Teams, all overseen by an International Board.\n\nP2P is a template for all of FCCI's conferences, seminars, groups and materials. \"P2P\" promotes four developmental objectives: Spiritual Maturity, Servant Leadership, Business Excellence and Kingdom Impact. The concept of a \"Kingdom Company\" is promoted as one where Biblical purpose and values, servant leadership and excellence lead to business transformation. Jesus Christ is the model; His teaching is the framework—all energized by the work of the Holy Spirit. Kingdom Companies are great places for anyone to work and often present non-Christians with their first exposure to Kingdom principles at work. Proselyting is not the objective. Conducting oneself in a manner that provokes questions on matters of faith is a goal (1Pet 3:15.) FCCI resources are developed with all of these P2P objectives in mind.\n\nIn the 1970s, FCCI's founding circle included: Larry Burkett, Bert Stumberg, Bobby Mitchell, Bill Leonard, Jim Moye, Smith Lanier, Ben Lively, Thomas Harris and Jimmy Pursell. Bruce Wilkinson, Larry Burkett, Walt Wiley, Ron Blue, Stanley Tam, Truett Cathy, Smith Lanier and Cade Willis were involved in the early years, providing teaching, training and leadership direction in various roles.\nA few days after September 11, 2001 at the 2011 FCCI International Conference in Maui, Dr. Henry Blackaby spoke very powerfully in one of FCCI's most memorable moments. \nMore recent content contributors for FCCI's conferences and group materials include: Ken Blanchard, Rick Warren, Dr. Richard Blackaby, Dr. John Townsend (author), Joel Manby [Undercover Boss], Dr. Tony Evans (radio), Pat Gelsinger and Francis Chan.\n\n"}

Clark, she spent her early life in Paris before relocating with her family to New York City, where she was educated at the Spence School. After a short-lived marriage ended in 1930, Clark returned to her residence at 907 Fifth Avenue, a large twelfth-floor apartment that she significantly expanded to occupying two floors. She also meticulously maintained Bellosguardo, a large familial estate in Santa Barbara, California, though she never returned to the property after the 1950s.\n\nClark spent much of her life outside of the public sphere, devoting her time to painting, the arts, and collecting various antiquities, primarily toys and dolls. In 1952, she purchased another property in New Canaan, Connecticut, but following the death of her mother in 1963, became increasingly reclusive. In 1991, she was admitted to Doctors Hospital in Manhattan to treat various basal cell cancer lesions on her face. Though she successfully recovered, Clark remained a hospital resident for the following two decades.\n\nUpon her death at 104 in 2011, Clark left behind a fortune of more than $300 million, most of which was donated to charity after a court dispute with her distant relatives. The events surrounding her estate and private affairs during the last several years of her life were covered extensively by journalist Bill Dedman, who subsequently co-wrote a book about her life.\n\nHuguette Marcelle Clark was born on June 9, 1906, in Paris, France. She was the second daughter of William A. Clark (18391925), from his second wife, Anna Eugenia Clark (née La Chapelle; 18781963). Her father was a former U.S. Senator from Montana and businessman involved in mining and railroads, who had largely amassed a fortune in copper mining operations in Butte, Montana and Jerome, Arizona. He was also a railroad magnate and one of the founders of Las Vegas. Her mother, the daughter of French-Canadian immigrants, was born and raised in Michigan, and was an aspiring singer and musician who met William while she was living in a boarding house in Butte. Clark was raised Roman Catholic, the faith of her mother, while her father was a Protestant.\n\nIn addition to her older sister, Louise Amelia Andrée Clark (1902–1919), she had five half-siblings from her father's first marriage to Katherine Louise Stauffer: Mary Joaquina Clark (1870–1939), Charles Walker Clark (1871–1933), Katherine Louise Clark (1875–1974), William Andrews Clark, Jr. (1877–1934), and Francis Paul Clark (1880–1896).\n\nClark spent her early life in France, living with her family at their apartment on Avenue Victor-Hugo in the 16th arrondissement. When she was five years old, she subsequently relocated to New York City, where she was educated at the Spence School in Manhattan. The family resided in a six-story, 121-room mansion located at 962 Fifth Avenue, the largest house in New York City at the time. Following the death of her father in 1925, Clark and her mother relocated from the mansion the Upper East Side of Manhattan, moving in to a twelfth-floor apartment at 907 Fifth Avenue.\n\nIn December 1927, Clark announced her engagement to law student William MacDonald Gower, a Princeton University graduate who was a son of one of her father's business associates, William Bleakly Gower. The two married on August 18, 1928 at Bellosguardo, her family's estate on the Pacific Coast in Santa Barbara, California. The same year, Clark agreed to donate $50,000 (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) to excavate a salt pond and create an artificial freshwater lake across from Bellosguardo. She stipulated that the facility would be named the Andrée Clark Bird Refuge, after her sister, who had died of meningitis. Clark and Gower separated in 1929, one year after their marriage, and divorced in Reno, Nevada, on August 12, 1930.\n\nAfter her divorce, Clark returned to the twelfth-floor apartment at 907 Fifth Avenue, where she had previously lived with her mother. Upon moving back in, Clark modified and expanded the apartment significantly, so that it took up the entire twelfth floor of the building, as well as half of the eighth. The residence grew to a total of 42 rooms, including a library, drawing room, and living room. According to architectural historian Andrew Alpern: \"If you stood with your back to the fireplace in the library, you could see out to Central Park through the living room window that is almost away!\" Clark and her mother continued to maintain Bellosguardo, and during the Great Depression had the original home torn down and rebuilt \"just to give people jobs.\" Clark visited Bellosguardo regularly during this period, staying there with family and friends. There, she befriended Barbara Dorn, the daughter of one of the property's caretakers. An acquaintance recalled that Clark \"hung out with rich daredevils who drove fast cars and flew rickety planes,\" but became close friends with Dorn, as both were shy and \"hid in the garden.\"\n\nClark was also a musician and painter, and in 1929 exhibited seven of her own paintings at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, located in Washington, D.C. She possessed an enthusiasm for the arts and was an avid collector of visual art, as well as antique toys and dolls. She reportedly had a very small group of friends and was \"skittish around strangers,\" spending much of her time in private, rarely leaving her residence. She occasionally attended Christian Dior fashion shows in New York City, but only to find inspiration for clothing to dress her dolls.\n\nIn 1952, she purchased a estate in New Canaan, Connecticut, referred to as \"Le Beau Chateau\". After the death of her mother in 1963, she became even more reclusive. Her mother's death left Clark the sole owner of Bellosguardo, which she had not visited since the 1950s. Despite her lack of visitation, Bellosguardo continued to be maintained throughout Clark's life for a total cost of $40,000 per month.\n\nAs she aged, Clark began to develop a distrust of outsiders, including her family, because she worried they were after her money. She preferred to conduct all of her conversations in French so that others were unlikely to understand the discussion. By 1991, Clark had grown frail and had numerous cancerous lesions that disfigured her face, making it difficult for her to see or eat. On March 26 that year, she was admitted to the Upper East Side's Doctors Hospital for treatment. Physicians there noted that she was so thin she appeared like \"an apparition ...  like somebody out of a concentration camp.\" Clark successfully underwent surgery to remove basal cell tumors from her face, as well as reconstructive surgery to her lips, right cheek, and right eyelid. A nurse initially noted in Clark's chart that she behaved \"like a homeless person – no clothes, not in touch with the world, had not seen a doctor for 20 years, and threw everyone out of the room.\"\n\nFollowing her treatment, Clark remained a resident of the hospital for the rest of her life. Though initially a resident of Doctors Hospital, she later transferred to Beth Israel Medical Center following the merger of the two hospitals. Her doctor, Henry Singman, \"had strongly urged that she go home,\" but Clark was \"perfectly happy, content, to remain in the situation she was in.\" She had regular visitation from private nurses and medical staff throughout the day and was provided meals in the hospital, where her 11th-floor room overlooked Central Park. Clark paid a daily sum of $829 to stay in the hospital. There, hospital officials recalled her eccentric interests, noting that she would often change conversational topics to cartoons such as \"The Smurfs\" and \"The Flintstones\".\n\nThroughout her nearly two-decades stay, Clark became very close with her private nurse, Hadassah Peri. Over the years, Clark gifted Peri and her family over $30 million dollars in various properties, vehicles, medical expenses, cash gifts, and college tuitions. A neurologist visited Clark in 2006, and noted that she was \"alert and cheerful, neurologically normal in every way ...  She seemed cute as pie, perfectly content.\" While Clark had a net worth of over $300 million, she was cash poor in her later life, selling properties in order to give large gifts to both friends and strangers$10 million to her best friend, and $25,000 to hospital workers who once fixed the television in her room.\n\nIn February 2010, Clark became the subject of a series of reports by Bill Dedman, an investigative reporter for NBC News. Dedman found that caretakers at her three residences had not seen her in decades, and that her palatial estates in Santa Barbara and New Canaan, Connecticut, had lain empty throughout that time, although the houses and their extensive grounds were meticulously maintained by their staff. He determined in 2010 that she was in the care of a New York City hospital, and that some of her personal possessions had been quietly sold. Some of the possessions sold include a rare 1709 violin called \"La Pucelle\" (or \"The Virgin\") made by Antonio Stradivari, and an 1882 Pierre-Auguste Renoir painting entitled \"In the Roses\".\n\nIn August 2010, the office of the New York County District Attorney initiated a probe into her affairs managed by her accountant, Irving Kamsler, and her attorney, Wallace Bock. Then a former paralegal for Bock's law firm, Cynthia Garcia, said that Bock received many lavish gifts from Clark, including a $1.5 million gift after the September 11 attacks in 2001, to build a bomb shelter in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank near the homes of his daughters. According to Garcia, Bock tried many times to get Clark to sign a will, including versions that included him as a beneficiary. Bock's spokesperson acknowledged that she had a will. In September 2010, in a one-paragraph ruling, Judge Laura Visitacion-Lewis turned down a request from a grand-half-nephew and two grand-half-niecesIan Devine, Carla Hall Friedman and Karine McCallto appoint an independent guardian to manage Clark's affairs.\n\nClark died on May 24, 2011 at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, two weeks short of her 105th birthday. She had been moved a month earlier to an intensive-care unit and later to a room with hospice care; at the time of her death, Peri was by her side. Though Clark had long said she did not want a funeral or priests, a Catholic priest was summoned to give her last rites.\n\nDuring this time, Clark had been living at Beth Israel under pseudonyms; the latest was Harriet Chase. Her room was guarded and she was cared for by part-time private nurses. Her room on the third floor had a card with the fake room number \"1B\" with the name \"Chase\" taped over the actual room number. A criminal investigation into the handling of her money was ongoing at the time of her death.\n\nShe was entombed on the morning of May 26, 2011, in the family mausoleum in section 85 of Woodlawn Cemetery, located in The Bronx, New York City, before the cemetery gates were open to the public. Her attorney said she had specific instructions that no funeral service or Mass be held. In 2008, Clark's representatives had obtained consent from other Clark family members to alter the mausoleum originally commissioned by her father. It was not until early 2011 that the mausoleum was altered to accommodate her entombment.\n\nClark's last will and testament was filed on June 22, 2011, in New York Surrogate's Court. This will was made in 2005 and left seventy-five percent of her estate, about $300 million, to charity. The will provided that her longtime nurse, Hadassah Peri, would receive about $30 million; her goddaughter, Wanda Styka, would receive about $12 million; and the newly created Bellosguardo Foundation would get $8 million. Other employees who managed her residences and affairs would receive smaller sums totaling $2 million, while Beth Israel Hospital, where she resided for many years and where she died, received $1 million. Her attorney and accountant would receive $500,000 each. A Claude Monet painting, part of his series of 250 oil paintings known as the \"Water Lilies\" (\"Nymphéas\"), was bequeathed to the Corcoran Museum of Art; she had purchased the 1907 painting from Galerie Durand-Ruel in 1930. The will described Clark as a \"reluctant heiress\" who \"possessed a large heart as well as a deep devotion to the arts.\" A portion of the will reads:\n\nIn October 2011, NBC News reported that an earlier will was signed six weeks before the second will; this earlier will left Clark's estate entirely to her family. A total of nineteen distant relatives of Clarkthe last of whom saw her in 1957, and many of whom never met hersubsequently challenged the second will, citing her \"obsession with high end, lifelike French and Japanese dolls, model castles, the Smurfs, her reclusiveness and tendency to give her money freely as evidence of mental illness.\" They also accused Peri, as well as her attorney and accountant, of defrauding her. While no one was charged with a crime, the accusations resulted in an investigation by the district attorney's office, who mandated that the will be settled before a jury trial.\n\nOn September 24, 2013, Clark's will was finally settled, with the majority of the distant relatives receiving a total sum of $34.5 million. Peri received nothing and agreed to return $5 million of the earlier $31 million in gifts made to her and her family. The bulk of the substantial remainder went to the arts, including the gift of her estate in Santa Barbara to a new foundation, called the Bellosguardo Foundation.\n\nIn March 2012, it was reported that shortly after Clark moved to a hospital in the early 1990s, a valuable pastel, \"Danseuse Faisant des Pointes\" (\"Dancer Making Pointes\"), by Edgar Degas, was stolen from her Fifth Avenue apartment. The painting was sold to Peter Findlay Gallery and later acquired in 1993 by H&R Block co-founder and art collector Henry W. Bloch. The Peter Findlay Gallery indicated that it acquired the piece from a \"European gentleman, seemingly from a good family, who visited New York from time to time\" and who claimed to have inherited the work. It was not until 2005 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation made Bloch aware that it was investigating the painting, and in 2007, they told Bloch that the painting had in fact been reported stolen from Clark.\n\nUnder an October 2008 deed of gift, Clark agreed to donate the pastel, valued at $10 million, to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, of which Bloch was a major benefactor. After making the gift, Clark made a request that the pastel be lent three times in 25 years to the Corcoran Museum of Art, that it be listed as from an anonymous donor, and that Clark personally receive a full-sized color photograph of the work. The museum kept the matter confidential, acknowledging ownership in a 2012 written exchange with NBC News.\n\nAfter her death, seventeen items from her personal jewel collection were auctioned off at Christie's on April 17, 2012. Buyers paid a total of over $20 million for the items, including a rare 9 carat pink diamond by Dreicer & Company that was purchased for over $15.7 million, which included a buyer's premium of 12 percent. The bulk of Clark's collection of art and antiquities were consigned to go on the auction block at Christie's in June 2014, over three years after her death. In July 2012, one of Clark's three 907 Fifth Avenue apartments, the penthouse #12W, sold for a pre-emptive $25.5 million, $1.5 million above the listing price, to Boaz Weinstein, the hedge fund manager and founder of Saba Capital Management, which was the biggest sale of the week according to city records.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Qatar attempted to purchase both of Clark's apartments on the eighth floor, which comprised the entire eighth floor, and combine the two into one huge apartment. However, the building's board did not allow it. In November 2012, apartment #8W was sold for $22.5 million to financier Frederick Iseman. The unit was listed for $19 million, but the sale includes a piece of unit #8E, which was later sold in October 2013 for $6.8 million to David Luski, president and chief executive officer at DRA Advisors LLC, after originally being listed for $12 million. In total, the three apartments sold for a combined $54.8 million.\n\nIn April 2014, after sitting empty for more than 60 years, Clark's French-style chateau known as \"Le Beau Chateau\", which sits on 52 wooded acres in New Canaan, Connecticut, was sold to the fashion designer Reed Krakoff and his wife. They purchased the home for the reduced price of $14.3 million.\n\nDedman co-wrote a book on Clark and her family, titled \"Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune\" (2014). The same year, it was reported that a film version had been optioned by Ryan Murphy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "199450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199450", "title": "Information industry", "text": "Information industry\n\nThe information industry or information industries are industries that are information intensive in one way or the other. It is considered one of the most important economic sectors for a variety of reasons. \n\nThere are many different kinds of information industries, and many different ways to classify them. Although there is no standard or distinctively better way of organizing those different views, the following section offers a review of what the term \"information industry\" might entail, and why. Alternative conceptualizations are that of knowledge industry and information-related occupation. The term \"information industry\" is mostly identified with computer programming, system design, telecommunications, and others. \n\nFirst, there are companies which produce and sell information in the form of goods or services. Media products such as television programs and movies, published books and periodicals would constitute probably among the most accepted part of what information goods can be. Some information is provided not as a tangible commodity but as a service. Consulting is among the least controversial of this kind. However, even for this category, disagreements can occur due to the vagueness of the term \"information.\" For some, information is knowledge about a subject, something one can use to improve the performance of other activities—it does not include arts and entertainments. For others, information is something that is mentally processed and consumed, either to improve other activities (such as production) or for personal enjoyment; it would include artists and architects. For yet others, information may include anything that has to do with sensation, and therefore information industries may include even such things as restaurant, amusement parks, and prostitution to the extent that food, park ride, and sexual intercourse have to do with senses. In spite of the definitional problems, industries producing information goods and services are called information industries.\n\nSecond, there are information processing services. Some services, such as legal services, banking, insurance, computer programming, data processing, testing, and market research, require intensive and intellectual processing of information. Although those services do not necessarily provide information, they often offer expertise in making decisions on behalf of clients. These kinds of service industries can be regarded as an information-intensive part of various industries that is externalized and specialized. \n\nThird, there are industries that are vital to the dissemination of the information goods mentioned above. For example, telephone, broadcasting and book retail industries do not produce much information, but their core business is to disseminate information others produced. These industries handle predominantly information and can be distinguished from wholesale or retail industries in general. It is just a coincidence, one can argue, that some of those industries are separately existing from the more obvious information-producing industries. For example, in the United States, as well as some other countries, broadcasting stations produce very limited amount of programs they broadcast. But this is not the only possible form of division of labor. If legal, economic, cultural, and historical circumstances were different, the broadcasters would have been the producers of their own programs. Therefore, in order to capture the information related activities of the economy, it might be a good idea to include this type of industry. These industries show how much of an economy is about information, as opposed to materials. It is useful to differentiate production of valuable information from processing that information in a sophisticated way, from the movement of information. \n\nFourth, there are manufacturers of information-processing devices that require research and sophisticated decision-making. These products are vital to information-processing activities of above mentioned industries. The products include computers of various levels and many other microelectronic devices, as well as software programs. Printing and copying machines, measurement and recording devices of various kinds, electronic or otherwise, are also in this category. The role of these tools are to automate certain information-processing activities. The use of some of these tools may be very simple (as in the case of some printing), and the processing done by the tools may be very simple (as in copying and some calculations) rather than intellectual and sophisticated. In other words, the specialization of these industries in an economy is neither production of information nor sophisticated decision-making. Instead, this segment serves as an infrastructure for those activities, making production of information and decision-making services will be a lot less efficient. In addition, these industries tend to be \"high-tech\" or research intensive - trying to find more efficient ways to boost efficiency of information production and sophisticated decision-making. For example, the function of a standard calculator is quite simple and it is easy to how to use it. However, manufacturing a well-functioning standard calculator takes a lot of processes, far more than the task of calculation performed by the users. \n\nFifth, there are very research-intensive industries that do not serve as infrastructure to information-production or sophisticated decision-making. Pharmaceutical, food-processing, some apparel design, and some other \"high-tech\" industries belong to this type. These products are not exclusively for information production or sophisticated decision-making, although many are helpful. Some services, such as medical examination are in this category as well. One can say these industries involve a great deal of sophisticated decision-making, although that part is combined with manufacturing or \"non-informational\" activities. \n\nFinally, there are industries that are not research intensive, but serve as infrastructure for information production and sophisticated decision-making. Manufacturing of office furniture would be a good example, although it sometimes involves research in ergonomics and development of new materials. \n\nAs stated above, this list of candidates for information industries is not a definitive way of organizing differences that researchers may pay attention to when they define the term. Among the difficulties is, for example, the position of advertising industry.\n\nInformation industries are considered important for several reasons. Even among the experts who think industries are important, disagreements may exist regarding which reason to accept and which to reject.\n\nFirst, information industries is a rapidly growing part of economy. The demand for information goods and services from consumers is increasing. In case of consumers, media including music and motion picture, personal computers, video game-related industries, are among the information industries. In case of businesses, information industries include computer programming, system design, so-called FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) industries, telecommunications, and others. When demand for these industries are growing nationally or internationally, that creates an opportunity for an urban, regional, or national economy to grow rapidly by specializing on these sectors. \n\nSecond, information industries are considered to boost innovation and productivity of other industries. An economy with a strong information industry might be a more competitive one than others, other factors being equal. \n\nThird, some believe that the effect of the changing economic structure (or composition of industries within an economy) is related to the broader social change. As information becomes the central part of our economic activities we evolve into an \"information society\", with an increased role of mass media, digital technologies, and other mediated information in our daily life, leisure activities, social life, work, politics, education, art, and many other aspects of society.\n\n"}

The facility also doubled as an ice hockey rink for Barnstable High School. The last public skate occurred on March 22, 2009. It was replaced by the Hyannis Youth and Community Center.\n\nThe Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Memorial Skating Centre rink opened in 1957 as an open-air skating rink. It was built with funds from the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. foundation, which made the name fitting. In 1960, the rink was extended in length from 185 to 215 feet, with its official 85 foot hockey width. At the time, this made it the second largest in the northeastern United States, behind one in West Point, New York. This was alright for skating during calm weather, but it was impossible to skate during a storm. Early skaters even had to shovel the ice after a snowfall. This led to it being enclosed in 1965.\n\nAlthough the rink was enclosed, it was open to the outside warm air. This led to fog forming on some nights. It was also unable to be used during the summer, a thing that most modern rinks do not have to do. This shortcomings led to replacement plans.\n\nFor many years, the rink was home to Barnstable High School's after prom celebration. The rink was used until 2008, when it was temporarily relocated to the high school because of the demolition of the rink.\n\nIn the early 2000s, there were plans to replace the rink with one rink next door in the Hyannis Youth and Community Center.

{"id": "945461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=945461", "title": "Marketing communications", "text": "Marketing communications\n\nMarketing communications (MC, marcom(s), marcomm(s)) uses different marketing channels and tools in combination: Marketing communication channels focuses on any way a business communicates a message to its desired market, or the market in general. A marketing communication tool can be anything from: advertising, personal selling, direct marketing, sponsorship, communication, promotion and public relations.\n\nMC are made up of the marketing mix which is made up of 4P's: Price, Promotion, Place and Product, for a business selling goods, and made up of 7P's: Price, Promotion, Place, Product, People, Physical evidence and Process, for a service based business.\nMarketing communications includes advertising, promotions, sales, branding and online promotion. The process allows the public businesses use to know or understand a brand. Successful branding involves targeting audiences who appreciate the organization's marketing program.\n\nAdvertising is a small but important part of marketing communications; the marketing communications mix is a set of tools that can be used to deliver a clear and consistent message to target audiences. It is also commonly called the promotional mix. Crosier (1990) states that all terms have the same meaning in the context of the 4ps: Product, price, place and promotion. Price can send a message to the target audience. For example, comparing a $50 bag to a $10 bag, the former may be viewed as a luxury or more durable item.\n\nThe marketing plan identifies key opportunities, threats, weaknesses and strengths, sets objectives and develops an action plan to achieve marketing goals. Each section of the 4P's sets its own object; for instance, the pricing objective might be to increase sales in a certain geographical market by pricing their own product or service lower than their competitors. This creates a significant change in the market because more people of the target market would aim to do business with your organization than your competitors, because pricing is one of the most significant aspects of marketing that can change the whole market positively and or negatively.\n\n\nCommunication is one important aspect of the marketing mix. Marketing communication is often the largest component of communication within a company, which may be to present company values, objectives or specific products and services to investors, customers or the general public. In the 21st century, communications objectives focus on more customized messages, targeting customer groups or individuals to create high responses and greater brand interaction.\n\nAs business becomes increasingly global with greater access to Internet, mobile phones and social media, new challenges exist to inform people in targeted foreign markets. Shifts in the global economy and access to new markets lead also to greater demands for product shipping and associated services. To be effective, communication strategies must converge with marketing objectives while also accounting for local languages, dialects and cultural norms.\n\nExternal communications might involve market research questionnaires, office website, guarantees, company annual report and presentations for investors. Internal communication can be the marketing materials, price list, product catalogues, sales presentations and management communications. On the other hand, each market demands different types of communications. For example, the industrial market demands a more personal communication but the consumer market demands non-personal communication.\n\nThere are also 4 different fundamental types of communication.\n\nOne-to-one is more immediate, while the many-to-may channels tend to be less urgent but with greater longevity.\n\nOne of the primary goals of a marketing communication is to persuade consumers, by either changing their perception of a brand, product or service, or persuading them to purchase (or feel motivated / tempted to purchase) a product or service. The \"Elaboration Likelihood Model\" is used to demonstrate how persuasion occurs. When a marketing communication message is sent out, first it must be acknowledged and attended by the receiver. By giving their attention to the marketing communication, consumers will begin to process and comprehend the message. There are two routes to persuasion: Central and peripheral. Central route processing is used in high-involvement purchase decisions. These are infrequent, high-risk purchases, usually involving large amounts of money and a significant amount of time (for example, purchasing a house or car). Because these purchase decisions are high risk, a large cognitive effort is expended in order to rationally select the most logical and valuable option available. In these marketing messages, information about the product or service itself is most valuable. \nPeripheral route processing is employed in low involvement purchase decisions. These are frequent, low-risk purchases, generally of a low or medium cost in which choices are made more on affective (or emotion based) values rather than cognitive (or rational) values. Because of this, marketing messages will employ more storytelling and imagery, focusing on how the product or service makes one feel, and the associations it has, rather than the attributes and specifications it possesses.\n\nCommunication can be defined as process of using, word, sound or visual cues to supply information to one or more people. A communication process is defined as information that is shared with the intent that the receiver understands the message that the business intended to send. The communication process was once thought of as having the source of the message, which is then encoded, put through the chosen communication channel, which is then decoded by the recipient and then received. Throughout the middle of the channel there is the potential for noise to distort the message being sent. Once the receiver has the message they then give feedback to the original source, where they then find out whether the campaign has been successful or not.\n\nWith the prevalent use of technology, customers are seeking out information about brands, products and businesses prior to purchase. This means that there is a need for an additional channel within the communication process, so it is a more accurate representation of the current business environment. Businesses are now having to take into consideration that both opinion leaders and opinion formers who have a great influence over today's society and their perceptions. So they have to be included into the communication process before the recipient of the message receives it.\n\nThis model is more effective when there is common ground between the senders and receivers so they can communicate effectively. Choosing the appropriate source helps develop the message and appeal to the targeted audience. The source will be more effective if they are relatable to the target audience. This realm of understanding is represented by the overlapping circles. The more knowledge the source has about who they are targeting, the better they can understand how the receiver may interpret or react to the message.\n\nThe components of the transactional model are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion leaders are consumers who have large influence over the purchasing behaviour of other consumers. These can be peers or celebrities, and often represent a \"desired state\" in the eye of the influenced consumer. By following the consumption patterns of opinion leaders, consumers aspire to achieve a similar status or lifestyle, and project a similar image. Because of this, opinion leaders are powerful factors in marketing communications. Having opinion leaders endorse a brand can increase brand awareness and sales. Due to this, large companies pay highly influential celebrities to endorse their products.\n\nYou can receive the opinion leaders' thoughts or feeling towards the product/service through paid advertising, social media, blogs, or any other form of written media. These can be direct, or indirect influences.\n\nOpinion Formers are consumers who are regarded by their peers as being highly knowledgeable and trustworthy. They are considered experts in selecting the highest quality products due to their extensive knowledge, and as such are able to influence the purchasing behaviour of other consumers despite lacking the celebrity status of an opinion leader. They have specialized knowledge about the area which corresponds with the product, service or business. For example, this could be a doctor sponsoring a form of medication, or a personal trainer recommending a sports brand to the customer. This means that both opinion leaders and opinion formers have a large influence on the consumer and their perceived view of the business, product, or service provided. If a brand is specializing in the sale and manufacturing of makeup products, the business would want to look at someone who is both known for their knowledge about makeup and also someone who they know is popular within that community, so that the message is as wide spread throughout their target market as possible.\nOpinion leaders add another link in the communication process, acting as a \"meaning filter\" for the receivers of the message (Dahlen, 2010). The message is sent from the sender and the opinion leaders share their opinions with the targeted audience.\n\nThe core model of communication has been criticized for its linearity – sender, message, receiver and its absence of structural perception. Since then an adjusted model of communication has developed.\n\nThe adjusted model of communication was developed within a marketing context, when marketers saw that people were affected more by influential homophilous groups (family and friends) and heterophilous groups (outside the person's network) than mass media (Dahlen, 2010).\n\nThe adjusted model is different to the core model of communication because it incorporates opinion leaders also known as gate keepers.\n\nTelevision has since its inception dominated the advertising media scene, due to its combination of visual and aural stimulation, allowing for greater attention grabbing and more effective transmission of messages than other forms of media. It has a few disadvantages: television commercials suffer from being \"zipped\" and zapped\". \"Zipping\" is the term given to fast forwarding commercial break sessions during the pre-recording of programs. Often viewers will record programs purely so they can be viewed without the commercial breaks. \"Zapping\" is the term given to the habit of many consumers to change channels during commercial breaks. This is also done to avoid watching advertisements. Using television advertisements is beneficial due to its wide reach and the degree to which content can be segmented according to the intended target market. Advertisements are carefully paired with time segments and / or linked with appropriate programming, known as \"media vehicles\". This helps to ensure the intended audience is being reached with the marketing message.\n\nWhile initial production costs of a television advertisement are high, it is likely to reach a mass audience and, therefore, maintains a low cost per viewer, making it an efficient communication platform.\n\nRadio by definition is the broadcasting of sound programmes to the public and today can be live streamed through a broadband connection or digitally transmitted into people's cars or homes. Despite being the oldest form of media transmission still being used, marketing via radio remains a popular and effective choice due to its relatively lower cost and convenience (radio exposure can occur during transit, at work, and during recreational activities). Due to the lack of a visual aspect, radio advertising attempts to create imagery in the consumers mind. Radio advertising is also extremely effective at reinforcing messages encountered in other channels (such as television). A familiar jingle or voice associated with a brand enhances brand and ad awareness, ultimately increasing brand equity. This is an example of \"Integrated Marketing Communications\", in which multiple marketing channels are simultaneously utilized to increase the strength and reach of the marketing message. Like television, radio marketing benefits from the ability to select specific time slots and programmes (in this case in the form of radio stations and segments within).\n\nFill et al. argue that radio communication promotes \"emotional consumer–centric associations\" as each listener is forced to construct a visual representation of the words and sounds such as music in their minds. A common technique used by companies is known as imagery transfer, where a complementary visual television advertisement is used alongside a one-dimensional radio advertisement featuring a similar audio track to stimulate a visual association between the two. Research suggests this sub-conscience relational thought process greatly benefits future brand recognition and awareness.\n\nRadio infomercials are often a simple script that is read out by the presenter. This is quick and does not require extensive lead times due to minimal production efforts.\n\nPrinted media is the most basic form of media advertising. It is the most challenging to create strong imagery with, due to its lack of sensory stimulation, but can be effective in efficient, clear information communication and message delivery. Where a consumer may miss a message in video or audio (perhaps a loud noise interrupts, or someone blocks their view) in print the message remains visible indefinitely. Aspects such as size, colour and style can be used to increase effectiveness relative to other print advertisements, which is important as despite being a basic media communication channel, print is the second largest medium after television (Ang, 2014. \"Principles of Integrated Marketing Communications\". Page 126.).\n\nTraditionally, marketing communications practitioners focused on the creation and execution of printed marketing collateral. Traditional media, or as some refer to as old media, has been used within the marketing and advertising world for many years. Traditional media encompasses conventional forms of advertising media, such as television, magazines, newspapers, radio, and direct mail and outdoor. For many decades, these forms of communication have been the main source for marketers to reach both consumers and other companies. In a world with no internet and the vast world of social media, roots of advertising and promotion lie within traditional media, where there is a more direct, physical way of advertising.\n\nAdvertising in the form of print is used by businesses in the form of billboards, magazines, newspapers and posters, to get their message across to the target audience. Businesses will usually place a billboard in areas where in can be easily seen and where the target audience will spend their daily activities. Newspaper, magazines and posters are smaller in size and can be found in numerous places allowing the general public availability to read them. Depending on the product or service that is being advertised, marketers may specify where majority of their prints may go to, such as advertisement of a new shampoo may be more common within salons.\n\nPrint media are a highly customizable, varying in print size, font, positioning and colour combination. Newspapers commonly use coarse paper and tend to have poor reproduction quality, while magazines can enhance the appearance of a certain product due to the heavy weight gloss paper used which translates colour well and offers a long lasting quality and likeability. Magazines function as a frame, a psychological device which manipulates perspective and judgement. For example, Vogue, a leading paid circulation fashion magazine, publishes advertising efforts alongside beautiful imagery and elegant photography, the association of the two communicates respectability and sophistication and promotes the creditability of the brands which appear in the same publication. Due to the high-quality reproduction, magazines tend to last longer and are often found in hair salons and waiting rooms. Consumers often cut out individual images which further prolongs the message and increases potential exposure. Although the relevance of the message may be lost during this extended time, brand awareness may still be raised. \n\nMagazines are often segmented by subject such as women's health, automotive or fashion and therefore effectively reach a particular target market while newspapers focus on geographical regions which tend to appeal to a broad representative population sample and, therefore, offer low impact in selectivity. Newspapers are often run on a weekly schedule offering up to date information and coverage of local events and businesses as a lower coast alternative. Such advertisements in smaller typeface and are black and white.\n\nTraditional media is gradually losing effectiveness. This change is driven by two key factors: audience fragmentation and ability to choose commercial content. Television, radio, magazines, and newspapers are becoming more fragmented and reaching smaller and more selective audiences. The rapid growth of communication due to interactive media, particularly the internet have caused the changes in the use of communication through media, with businesses preferring to use modern media over more traditional media methods. Consumers cannot avoid new and innovative ways of communication. Many marketers believe that traditional methods of advertising have become too expensive and is not cost-effective compared to modern media. Traditional forms of marketing communications such as advertising are one way in nature, whereas new media allows marketers to perform a variety of functions.\n\nCommunication platforms like Skype, Facebook or other types of media have become extremely important means of communication. Although there are other methods of communications that aren't just related to social media, people can also be hugely influenced by their peers, this process is known as social mediation. Marketing Communication Platforms are a powerful capability for personalizing and expending marketing contents in an automated fashion based on the profile of the recipients.\n\nA platform by simplest definition is a raised floor or stage. It functions as a similar principle in marketing communications, providing awareness and information about a specific brand or product. Strategic selection of various communication platforms is known as a media strategy which aims to engage an audience in a meaningful conversation and, as a result, create a lasting relationship. Modern technology has expanded the use of platforms and ways in which consumers and the brand can interact. As a result, the context of platforms and how they are defined has changed. There are various platforms by which communication is transmitted, and these can be categorised as paid, owned, earned and shared, formally named as the integrated communication triangle by Grönroos and Lindberg-Repo. The model acknowledges that communication must be credible and trustworthy to be effective. Studies reveal many consumers look at review forums and ask friends or peers whom they trust for ratings on products before making a purchase decision. Therefore, effective communication relies on an integrated approach of one dimensional and interactive platforms.\n\nExplicitly planned market content is communicated through non-personal communication platforms. The brand is in control of the platform, message content, frequency and repetition of the communication message. This is typically accomplished through traditional paid platforms, such as, print, electronic, outdoor and alternative media, that aims to target a mass segment of the target market.\n\nOther aspects of noise decrease the effectiveness of message penetration, for example, most paid communication platforms, print and electronic media are filled with marketing and advertising messages and are subject to clutter, often forcing brands to compete for attention. To eliminate noise brands often choose to include inserts such as samples and scent strips within magazines while newspapers utilise \"call to action\" inserts such as coupons which encourage consumers to visit or try a local service or good.\n\nDue to the rise in advertising clutter, there has been a push for non-traditional media such as guerrilla marketing. Guerrilla Marketing is usually a low-cost way of generating buzz through creative or unexpected communication platforms. Outdoor settings provide potential ground to gain attention from a large audience. An example is customizing street infrastructure or creating an event such as a flash mob. Research rates guerrilla advertising as having a higher perceived value compared to other communication platforms, which tends to result in a positive consumer response. An example of successful guerrilla marketing was created by Volkswagen (VW) in their promotional \"driven by fun\" campaign, where consumers could use VW \"fast lane\" slide instead of the escalator to get to the bottom of the stairs faster.\n\nEvery point of contact is a form of communication and it is, therefore, necessary to consider touch points as a communication platform. Touch points can be either physical or a human interaction between a brand and the consumer which influence customer decision-making process during pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase.\n\nThere are many ways in which a customer may interact with a business. Interactions occur through direct customer service exchanges, a company website, the point of purchase environment and product packaging or performance. These all contribute to consumer perceptions of a particular brand. For instance, the service-scape of a purchase touch point such as a retail store can influence the perception of quality and service through lighting and layout or other sensory touch points, for example smell. Fast fashion retailers such as Topshop maintain a white store interior and exterior which is perceived as luxurious. Likewise, the higher price point and packaging of Ferrero Rocher may communicate sophistication and better quality. Visual appearance can have a significant effect on purchase decision, companies such as Coke a Cola and Pepsi provide a free fridge to distributors to control how products are displayed at the point of purchase.\n\nWhile boarding a United Airlines flight, Dave Carroll saw baggage handlers on the tarmac damage his Taylor guitar. After failed attempts to solve the issue through customer service, Carroll uploaded a humorous YouTube video titled \"United breaks guitars\", which experienced over 15 million views. Reportedly, United faced a drop in the stock market. Carroll's YouTube video is an example of the multiplier effect, and how consumer experiences are shared through user-generated content (UGC) networks and word of mouth communication. Research shows customer are more likely to pass on negative experiences, and therefore, such interactive platforms have a significant impact on purchase decisions and brand outlook.\n\nThis highlights a trend in integration of consumer behaviour with marketing communications, where technology has facilitated social group communication. Communication has changed from one direction with companies in control of their message to a dialogue where businesses interact with consumer feedback. As Andy Lark, Commonwealth Bank CMO states \"the power has shifted, we are now entering a transparent age where there are no secrets\".\n\nTraditional models viewed paid media platforms as the primary source of information. However technology has enabled dialogue within a consumer-centric communication platform. This flow of information allows a many-to-many exchange through UGC, which includes all types of creative content online through blogs, chats, forums, online platforms for product reviews and social media websites such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, which are known as earned and shared media.\n\nNike built an example of co-creation and customer empowerment through earned and shared media. Nike ID is an online application that allows customers to design their shoe and therefore \"Just do it online\". Market-generated media remain an important communication platform and information source. Consumers tend to consider both market-generated and UGC when making a purchase decision, particularly, for higher involvement product like vinyl record albums. The transition from traditional media to various forms of online and UGC marketing is increasing. Academics recognize that marketing communication is an open system and customers are influenced by multiple communication platforms. Ultimately positive brand encounters manifest brand supporters who contribute to positive earned and shared media, through product recommendations online and offline.\n\nThe Internet features both non-personal and personal forms of communication. It has become one of the most dominant sources of information for most consumers. Belch & Belch explained that the internet is mostly a non-personal form of communication as consumers absorb information online with no personal contact between the consumer and the organizations that are providing the information on their websites. However, as the internet develops, it is including personal communication as consumers interact with marketers online as well as communicate and share information with one another through the use of social media.\n\nThe Internet allows multimedia documents to be shared among its users. approximately 30 million websites have been registered worldwide and 650 million were connected to the Internet. The Internet as a marketing tool can be used to reach and inform customers directly, create brand loyalty, and build relationships. Online advertising includes elements such as: graphic images as website banners, pop-up advertisements, homepage restyling and anchor deals (co-operation between two organizations ).\n\nInteractivity is a characteristic feature of the Internet that was described in 1996 by John Deighton. He argued that in the then-new Internet business environment, clients rather than the marketers usually start the interaction, by actively looking for the information that they need. Moreover, personal responses of customers will be collected by corporations and their individual demands will be met according to their desires.\n\nOn one hand, traditional media are \"push\" formats where marketers broadcast their messages to customers, but do not allow direct feedback. The interaction between the two parties is few and far between. On the other hand, Internet media have the attribute of \"pull\" where customers have the freedom to search for whatever they wish. For instance, whenever a consumer types \"flower\" on Google's search engine, an advertisement of a specific flower shop might be placed on the top or bottom of the search result page by the Google Adword program. Google makes use of the client's search history and location to place an appropriate ad. The traditional one-way \"push\" communication is supplanted by the more productive two-way \"push and pull\" interaction.\n\nCompared with the traditional media where the same information is received by all consumers, Internet media can send information \"tailored\" to the need of a specific consumer.This is another advantage of two-way interaction of the Internet media. One of the first and most prominent examples is the personalized service provided by Amazon in which consumers are called by their names and \"tailored\" recommendations are provided according to their previous purchase records. Furthermore, besides \"tailored\" individual service, with the accumulation of consumers' information on the Internet, mass customisation becomes possible in which companies provide \"tailored\" content to particular segment of consumers with similar interests. Douban is a Chinese social networking service website which allows its users to rate movies, TV dramas, music and concerts. It rapidly grew to 200 million registered users in 2013 (founded in 2005). In addition, people who like the same TV drama, like \"Game of Thrones\", or fans of the same movie star, such as Tom Cruise, will group together to discuss and share their feelings. This allows companies to take advantage of mass customisation to sell products or reinforce their brand equity in suitable target groups. By doing so, the interaction and co-operation of companies and consumers are deepening, widening and multiplying in a variety of ways.\n\nRestructuring followed by disintermediation and reintermediation is one of the essential features of the transition from traditional to Internet marketing communications. The Internet may force traditional distributors or retailers out of business simply because Internet transactions are less costly. JD.com significantly impacted the distribution channels for personal computers in China as of 2009 by allowing consumers to order different parts of the computers, that were then assembled by the online business, leaving tens of thousands of retailers in that field out of their jobs. In 2015, JD.com accounted for 22.9% of the Chinese online shopping's market share. Again, according to \"Financial Times\", with the shifting trend of using mobile phones for online purchase in China, the people using cellphones to log on to the Internet outnumbered those using PC, the next wave of restructuring faced by JD.com and its major competitors like Alibaba. In 2014, JD.com's orders deriving from mobile phones increased by 543%, compared with the last year's quarter of the same period. Haoyu Shen, the chief executive of the JD.com, ascribed this result to its own company's app rather than the co-operation with Tecent, the Chinese second largest online corporation, although it invested in JD.com in March 2014. As an ecommerce business, JD.com has been constantly facing challenges and opportunities of reintermediation with the rapid shifts of the technology development of the Internet.\n\nSocial media's market penetration is rising thanks to services like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. Companies are using these external social media platforms to personally engage with existing and future customers, reinforce brand messaging, influence customer opinions, provide targeted offers, and service customers more efficiently..\n\nEmail marketing is directly marketing a commercial message to a group of people using email. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It usually involves using email to send ads, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build loyalty, trust, or brand awareness. Email marketing can be done to either sold lists or a current customer database. Broadly, the term is usually used to refer to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing the relationship of a merchant with its current or previous customers, to encourage customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and adding advertisements to email messages sent by other companies to their customers.\n\nAnother channel for direct digital marketing is in-product communication (or in-product marketing), which delivers marketing content directly to a user's internet-connected device or software application. In-product marketing content is often very similar to that of email marketing campaigns, but the segmentation and delivery is more targeted. Because email has become a standard tool in the digital marketing toolkit, the email channel often is overloaded and overused, leading to much lower open rates, lower engagement rates, lower click-through rates (CTR), and lower conversion rates. The rise of internet-connected (IOT) devices is enabling a growing number of consumer products manufacturers to take advantage of this channel of marketing communications, to supplement other digital marketing channels.\n\nIn direct marketing the producer communicates directly with potential customers, instead of through third party media. Individual customer's responses and transactions are recorded. Direct marketing is a growing form of marketing communication. It is designed to build the relationship between the customer and the brand, known as customer relationship management (CRM). Organizations use customer accounts in order to monitor and understand their needs. They manage detailed information about the customer's touch points with the objective to maximize satisfaction and loyalty. The communication can be in person, by telephone, mail, email or website. The interaction between the organization and the customer is usually a two-way communication. Direct marketing relies on CRM databases which contain valuable customer information. Good quality databases can provide a competitive advantage and increase profitability. Treating the customer database as an expense rather than an investment, or not continuously maintaining or updating them can be detrimental.\n\nDirect mail is a letter, card, catalogue, or sample sent through post, email, fax, or courier. This communication is most effective when the recipient has shown interest in or has previously purchased from the organization. Advantages of direct mail are personalisation, careful targeting, creativity and flexibility. Email is low-cost, but can be lost through spam and junk email filters. Direct mail is dependent on accurate databases.\n\nTelemarketing is marketing communication via telephone. There are two types of telemarketing: outbound and inbound. Outbound telemarketing is used by organizations to reach out to potential customers, generate sales, make appointments with salespeople and introduce new products. Inbound telemarketing is where people call the organization to complain or inquire about products. Both outbound and inbound can be used as a customer service strategy to boost sales and receive suggestions for improvement. Advantages of telemarketing include targeted communications, flexible and direct interaction between the organization and the customer, it can be an effective personal selling partner and it is cost effective compared to face-to-face contact. A disadvantage is that call centres are usually used to handle outbound and inbound telemarketing, which need to be implemented, managed and financed.\n\nMail order marketing is a catalogue of products that customers can order to receive in the mail. This form of direct marketing dates back over 100 years. Home shopping, online shopping and teleshopping now accompany it. With current technology mail order has improved. Now there can be a larger range in catalogue, delivery is faster, and complaints are dealt with professionally. Mail order exerts less pressure on the customer than telemarketing and sales are easy to manage, however costly infrastructure is required in maintaining the back-end.\n\nDirect-response advertising is partially direct marketing. It is a message transmitted through traditional communications media that requires the reader, viewer, listener or customer to respond directly to the organization. The audience may respond to receive more information or to purchase a product. A common example of direct response advertising is in television \"home shopping immediately to receive a particular deal or discount. Disadvantages are that focus can be lost because of the medium of communication and the targeting can be less narrow compared to direct mail. Organizational messages can get cluttered and crowded.\n\nCellular marketing uses audience's mobile phone and SMS to promote a product or brand. Advantages are a high level of flexibility and easy integration through computer systems using the Internet to send mass text messages. This marketing communications platform allows organizations to directly target customers to remind them to renew subscriptions, give exclusive product discounts, or build brand reputation through competitions or sweepstakes. \nThe disadvantage is that some customers are charged to receive SMS, so opt-in permission is required.\n\nCD and DVD discs can be used as part of e-communications. Entire marketing presentations, catalogues, brochures and price lists can be stored on a CD. CDs are small and simple to hand out to target audiences and most modern computers have CD drive readers, however most of the same information can be presented on a website or email.\n\nIntegrated marketing communications (IMC) is the use of marketing strategies to optimise the communication of a consistent message of the company's brands to stakeholders. Coupling methods together improves communication as it harnesses the benefits of each channel, which when combined together builds a clearer and vaster impact than if used individually. IMC requires marketers to identify the boundaries around the promotional mix elements and to consider the effectiveness of the campaign's message.\n\nIn the mid to late 1980s, the marketing environment was undergoing profound environmental changes with implications for marketing communications. Media proliferation, audience fragmentation, globalisation of markets, the advent of new communications technologies, the widespread use of databases meant that the old methods, and practices used in mass marketing were no longer relevant. In particular, the rise of digital and interactive media meant that marketers were relying less on advertising as the dominant form of marketing communications. Amongst practitioners and scholars, there was an increasing recognition that new approaches to marketing communications were required. That new approach would become known as \"integrated marketing communications.\" A number of empirical studies, carried out in the early 1990s, found that the new IMC was far from a \"short-lived managerial fad,\" but rather was a very clear reaction by advertisers and marketers to the changing external environment.\n\nIntegrated marketing communications is a holistic planning process that focuses on integrating messages across communications disciplines, creative executions, media, timing and stakeholders. An integrated approach has emerged as the dominant approach used by companies to plan and execute their marketing communication programs and has been described as a \"paradigm shift.\"\n\nIMC unifies and coordinates an organization's marketing communications to promote a consistent brand message. Coordinating a brand's communications makes the brand seem more trustworthy and sound, as it is seen as a 'whole' rather than a mixture of different messages being sent out. The IMC perspective looks at the 'big picture' in marketing, advertising and promotions.\n\nThe impetus to rethink marketing communications came from a number of environmental changes that were becoming increasingly apparent throughout the mid to late 1980s. Media was proliferating and at the same time converging, audiences were fragmenting and many new communications disciplines were emerging. Few advertising agencies provided the full suite of services in terms of the varied communications disciplines. Companies were reliant on a multiplicity of service providers for assistance with advertising, public-relations, branding, packaging, sales promotion, event organisers and other promotional activities. Each of these communications disciplines was treated as a \"silo\"; with little thought to the synergies between them,with the result that many different stakeholders involved in presenting the company's external image throughout the breadth and length of a campaign. In that environment, both practitioners and theorists recognised the potential for confusing or inconsistent brand images to develop across media and across different communications disciplines. The fragmentation of audiences presented marketers with particular challenges. No longer were they able to communicate with mass markets via mass media; instead they needed to communicate with increasingly tightly defined market segments, using highly specialist media and communications disciplines. New media and the use of databases were enabling marketers to communicate with customers on a one-to-one basis. The old methods and practices associated with mass communications were failing to serve the realities of the new era. The imperative to present a clear, coherent and unified narrative in both internal and external communications was becoming increasingly apparent by the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1989, two discrete events served to draw attention to the fact that industry attitudes to marketing communications were shifting. Firstly, the consulting firm, Shearson-Lehman Hutton published a report on the subject of consumer advertising, signalling that a number of market-place changes would force packaged goods marketers to adopt a more integrated approach to marketing communications. Their report also noted that high-end manufacturers (e.g. automobiles) and up-market services (e.g. cruise vacations) were more inclined to use integrated promotions. Secondly, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A's), instituted a task-force to investigate integrated marketing communications (IMC), with the result that the first official definition was published. The AAAA defined IMC as, \"a concept of marketing communications planning that recognizes the added value of a comprehensive plan that evaluates the strategic roles of a variety of communication disciplines (e.g. general advertising, direct response, sales promotion, and public relations) and combines these disciplines to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communication impact.\" At this stage, the development of IMC, focused primarily on the need for organisations to offer more than just standard advertising and to integrate the various communications disciplines. The 4As originally coined the term the \"new advertising\"; however, this title did not appropriately incorporate many other aspects included in the term \"IMC\" – most notably, those beyond traditional advertising process aside from simply advertising.\nIn 1991, the faculty of Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern University in conjunction with the AAAA, began the first empirical research study designed to investigate how IMC was being used. The study focused around understanding the concept and the importance of IMC and also to analyse the extent in which IMC was practiced in all major U.S advertising agencies. This initial study was then replicated by other studies with a view to examining how IMC was being used in other countries; New Zealand, UK, US, Australia, India, Thailand, South Africa and the Philippines, etc. The findings from these studies demonstrated that the new IMC was far from a \"short-lived managerial fad\" but rather was \"a very clear reaction by advertising agencies and their clients as they are affected by a multitude of factors such as new forms of information technology including development and usage of databases, media fragmentation, client desires for interaction/synergy, and global and regional coordination.\" This was the second stage of IMC's development, where the focus shifted to documenting the practice of IMC as a global phenonenon. In other words, researchers were attempting to codify practices that had been used for some time.\n\nIn 1993, Don Schultz and his team published the first text-book dedicated to IMC. Their work, simply entitled, \"Integrated Marketing Communications,\" described IMC as a totally new way of looking at the whole of marketing communications, rather than looking at each of the parts separately. And, in the same year, the Medill School at Northwestern University changed their curriculum to include a focus on this new idea of integrated marketing communications rather than the traditional program which had emphasised advertising. IMC emerged from an \"academic department that, for several decades, had been recognized as the number one advertising program. Since the mid-1990s, virtually every text-book on the subject of marketing communications has adopted an integrated perspective or has added chapters on IMC in new editions of standard works. Collectively these books focus on the IMC planning processes and this represents the third distinct stage in the evolution of IMC – an emphasis on managing and organising IMC.\n\nOver time, scholars have advanced different definitions of IMC, with each definition exhibiting a slightly different emphasis. Yet, in spite of the variety of definitions in circulation, there is general consensus that integrated marketing communications should be viewed as a planning process. Some scholars have pointed out that because IMC is both a process and a concept, it is exceedingly difficult to define.\n\nSome of the key definitions that have been advanced during IMC's evolution are outlined here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, there is general agreement amongst both practitioners and scholars that the emergence of IMC represents \"a significant example of development in the marketing discipline... [that] has influenced thinking and acting among all types of companies and organizations facing the realities of competition in an open economy.\" Belch and Belch argue that IMC has become the dominant approach used by companies to plan and execute their marketing communication programs while other scholars have described IMC as a \"paradigm shift.\" Larry Percy argues that \"the planning and execution of \"all\" marketing communication should be \"integrated\"\".\n\nWithin the literature there is no absolute agreement about the meaning of \"integration\" in the concept, \"integrated marketing communications\". The concept of IMC has evolved during its brief history, and with that different ideas around the meaning of integration have been advanced. The diverse views surrounding IMC and its meaning can be explained by the early state of theoretical development and research on IMC which gives rise to a mulplicity of different perspectives. As the discipline matures, these different views are expected to converge.\n\nThe marketing and advertising literature identifies many different types of integration:\n\nFunctional integration refers to the capacity of the different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message. Each of the communications disciplines (advertising, PR, personal selling, sales promotion etc.) has its own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, it is generally recognised that straight advertising is very effective at creating brand awareness, but much less effective at converting awareness into actual sales. As consumers approach the actual purchase, they may turn to other types of promotion such as personal selling or direct marketing. A carefully planned communications program will include a blend of tools in a way that the messages move the customer through the various stages of the purchase decision – from need recognition through to purchase and post-purchase stages. Integrating the communications disciplines addresses the question of how the strengths of one discipline can be used to overcome the weaknesses of a different discipline.\n\nMessage integration is also known as \"image integration\" or \"creative integration\". A key task for IMC is ensuring consistency in executions within and across the different types of marketing communications, as well as over time. Everything connected with an IMC campaign should have a similar 'look and feel', irrespective of the medium or tool. Message integration does not imply that messages need to identical. Rather it means that every piece of promotion – from advertising to direct mail to collateral materials to packaging to posters to corporate vehicles to business cards and office stationery – should be immediately recognisable as part of the same livery.\n\nClearly, media releases which are often part of a PR program are very different to persuasive messages used in advertising. However, messages should include a similar tone and at least some common elements so that each message looks like it is part of a coherent, integrated campaign. Every execution is part of the brand's identity. Consistent executions facilitate brand awareness. People associate the 'look' of the brand's marketing communication with the brand itself. Consistent executions are more of a 'feeling' that ties everything together; a unique look or feel so that the target audience recognizes a brand's marketing communication even before they see the brand name. The key to consistency is the visual feel. This is because the visual memory for the imagery associated with the brand actually elicits faster brand identification than the brand name itself.\n\nMuch IMC planning is concerned with co-ordinating different media channels to optimize the effectiveness of marketing communications programmes. If brand communications \"reflect implied brand values and imagery that are consistent throughout differing media channels, then clearly these channels act in a mutually reinforcing way with each successive consumer engagement.\" Certain messages may not translate into other media. For instance, messages containing 'sex appeals' may work well on TV because movement lends itself to eroticism, but may become \"flat\" in a static medium such as print. In such cases it is important that the secondary media support the primary media and that messages harmonise.\n\nResearch studies suggest that consumers learn more quickly when exposed to messages via different media. The explanation for this is that slight variations in execution create a slight mental perturbation which grabs attention, and results in more elaborate encoding of the main message argument. By exposing consumers to the same message through multiple media, there are more opportunities to engage with consumers. In short, a multi media strategy is more effective.\n\nIntegration of timing refers to the timing messages so that they operate to support each other and reach potential customers at different junctures, depending on when they are most receptive to different types of message or depending on the consumer's readiness to buy.\n\nOther types of integration include:\n\nBoth practitioners and scholars agree that IMC makes practical \"good sense\". Consequently, the discipline has relatively few critics. Nevertheless, researchers have pointed to areas that are in need of further research, and highlight some of the discipline's deficiencies:\n\n\n\n\nThe marketing communications planning framework (MCPF) is a model for the creation of an ICM plan. Created by Chris Fill, senior examiner for the Chartered Institute of Marketing, the MCPF is intended to solve the inadequacies of other frameworks.\n\nAn “inside-out” approach is the traditional planning approach to marketing communication. Planning begins \"inside\" the organisation by identifying the goals and objectives which are often based around what has always been done. Communication's task then becomes a process of \"selling\" the organisation's message to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders. .\n\nThe inside–out approach to integrated marketing communications has been criticised as a one sided view point, since it combines the elements of communication and marketing to create a single unified message. Porcu and his team point out that many of the first, tentative attempts to practice IMC were primarily concerned with integrating the message, so that to organisation appeared to speak with \"one voice,\" but failed to adopt a more rounded customer orientation. The inside–out approach is weak due to the stagnant, outdated method.\n\nThe outside–in approach of integrated marketing communications seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer. In addition to the previous category, this approach establishes significant progression. Organisations can gain in-depth knowledge based on consumers and therefore can accommodate the way they approach to fulfil their requirements. Relationship marketing aids in building up a history of frequent conversation between organisations and stakeholders which contributes to trust. Communication builds rapport that could prove to be profitable as they retain clientele. The outside-in approach offers a unique way to planning, as it operates backwards by concentrating on customers first, then determining the most effective course of marketing and communication methods to implement. Effectively managing the strategic business process is crucial as it defines the steps to follow which ensure brand value is upheld.\n\nCross-functional planning approach of integrated marketing communications diverges away from the other two categories, it does not centre around the concept of marketing promotional elements, instead the focus has shifted toward restructuring the organisation to increase a customer-centric environment. This approach recognises that messages do not just come from the marketing department, but can come from virtually any department within the organisation. Investing for the reorganisation sparks change where all departments interconnect to work cohesively toward managing and planning all stages of brand relationship. As a unified organisation, the cross-functional process is a competitive advantage as they can achieve profitable relationships with customers and stakeholders. This can be achieved through improving the relation amongst messages sent from all departments through channels to the receivers. By sending strategic messages and monitoring any external reaction, organisations gain feedback data from consumers which can be used to inform subsequent planning or fine-tuning of the communications strategy. The process is circular, not linear, at the beginning organisation and consumer communicate by interacting and dialogue which ignites the relationship, over time trust is earned and the consumer may continue to purchase, which in turn increases sales and profitability for the organisation and finally, the relationship is strong and the organisation retains clientele. Interactive communication is advantageous for a cross-functional approach as the business and consumer are both involved in brand communication. Implementing IMC is a flexible process due to the changing nature of the marketing dynamics therefore by eliminating borders within the organisation it allows for this notion.\n\nThe barriers to implementation have been cited as one of the main reasons for the failure to adopt holistic approaches to IMC. The key barriers cited in the literature are:\n\nNo support from senior management\n\nIt is vital for an organisation who implements integrated marketing communications to have the commitment from all levels of employees, including senior management. The union between both marketing and corporate goals should coincide and support simultaneously. The lack of involvement from senior management could lead to IMC being deprived of resources which prevents the full potential IMC can deliver for the organisation to benefit from. Higher levels of the business need to coincide with the efforts of staff in the strategic planning to grasp that IMC's programme is valuable.\n\nClients are confused about the concept\n\nSome companies such as advertising agencies could possibly take advantage of the integrated marketing communications model, due to the stress they receive from clients and budgets being reduced. The introduction of new technology broadens the boundaries for advertising elements to endeavour with such avenues like the internet. Their focus may stray from the core principles of IMC which is to integrate the elements together, as they're less effective individually. Also, their clients may not grasp the IMC concept as an essential attribute, therefore, they perceive IMC as saving money due to the strategic juxtaposition.\n\nOrganisation is too specialised\n\nOne of the core fundamentals of integrated marketing communications is that of the focus aspires toward a customer orientation. In spite of that, the purpose of some organisations have not adopted the framework and are still task orientated. Examples include public relations, direct marketing and advertising.\n\nConflict within organisation\n\nTrying to implement integrated marketing communications into strong hierarchy structured organisations may cause staff resistance due to the nature of horizontal communication causing disagreements amongst staff. Staff may not perform their tasks and functions which jeopardises the work environment. For IMC to be successful the culture of the organisation needs to accommodate an open perspective where communication amongst the varying departments are managed tactically. Individuals reactions toward the new restructure will differ, as some become custom to the process and enjoy the borderless integration, on the other hand, some may feel threatened from the absence of control that once maintained order and power within the previous structured organisation (Vladmir, Miroslav, & Papic, 2012). A corporate structure may not necessarily invite IMC due to their culture being incompatible for the integration.\n\nIntegrated marketing communication is the process of communicating an idea in order to attract customers using an array of tools. It is the process of sending out a message to a receiver (Communications, 2016). Depending on the company values and the type of product or service they offer, the most appropriate message to deliver will depend on the brand and consumer. To understand how integrated marketing communication can benefit a business, three main areas will be discussed. These areas being who the Sender is? Who is the Receiver? And what tools can the sender use in order to pass a message on to the receiver?\n\nPractical solutions towards improving marketing strategies by using ICM can be done through two differing marketing concepts the four P's or the four C's . Also, the uses of encoding and decoding should be followed, all of which intertwine to form growth in sales financially for a business.\n\nA sender is someone who is aiming to communicate an idea to a receiver, which might be an individual or a group. Marketers must first understand who the receive is in order to successfully implement marketing communications. For example, Staples seeks to identify itself as a 'one-stop' shop for all office needs. It advertises a wide variety of office supplies, safe and on time delivery, competitive pricing and excellent customer service. Staples focuses its marketing efforts on advertising those values. Their slogan \"To make more happen, everyday\". This theme is the most appropriate because it attracts their target audience. Workers have little time on their hands, the product they offer will give them the ability to make life easier; by doing so, they save time. In today's fast-paced lifestyle, if a service is convenient, customers will most likely use the product. Staples have successfully taken the necessary steps in order to communicate their values to their customers. They have done this through understanding who they are and who they should be targeting.\n\nOriginally, marketing was focused around the 4P's (product, price, place and promotion) which concentrated on companies' internal concepts. The idea of integrated marketing communications was first raised in 1993 by Don E. Schultz, who changed the 4P's concept into the 4C's model. The four parts include consumer, communication, convenience and cost, taking into consideration the needs and wants of consumers. Integrated marketing communications accomplished synergy when each element was executed in accordance with the overall vision of the organisation's campaign, which allows the message to be executed efficiently. Finding out who the target market is to answer the 4C's: knowing what products they're willing to purchase, the amount of money they are willing to spend for it, how the product will fulfil their needs and wants, the accessibility of the product and how easily correct information is transmitted. Changing the emphasis onto what consumers desire leads to a higher success being attained through IMC, as it is being influenced by not only internal stakeholders but also external ones.\n\nExpanding from this, Tom Duncan and Sandra E. Moriarty formed the concept of communication-based relationship marketing. This model diverged from the concept of the general one way, business influencing consumers what to believe scenario. However, Duncan and Moriarty argued that communication between business and consumers was the key to developing strong establishment for consumer orientated marketing endeavours. The process of IMC through communication-based marketing goes through a sequential three stage process. Organisations begin with choosing an effective mixture of communication methods; then, the marketing methods are selected; thereafter, the best of each element is fused and integrated together which thence is channelled from the organisation to the audience. Subsequently, these findings shaped modern marketing, focusing on an interactive two-way approach that builds rapport with stakeholders. Developments from integrated marketing communications have evolved into three categories: inside-out approach, outside-in approach and cross-functional strategic approach.\n\nBranding goes beyond having a logo; it is how businesses communicate on behalf of their company, verbally and visually. A brand is a conversation it is how people talk about your company when you are not in the room. Consumers are constantly interacting and meeting with brands. This can be through television or other media advertisements such as event sponsorships, personal selling and product packaging. Brand exposure such as this is known as a brand touch point or brand contact whereby the organization can try impressing its consumer. Without branding, consumers wouldn't be able to decipher between products and decide which one they like most. People may not be able to even tell the differences between some of the brands, they would have to try each brand several times before being able to judge which one was best. In order to help with purchase decisions, marketing communications try to create a distinct image for the brand. Brand associations are made to encourage linkages with places, personalities or even emotions which creates a sophisticated brand personality in the minds of the consumers. This shows how brand communications add value to products and why branding is a crucial aspect to the communication platform.\n\nMarketing communications are focused on the product/service as opposed to corporate communications where the focus of communications work is the company/enterprise itself. Marketing communications are primarily concerned with demand generation and product/service positioning while corporate communications deal with issue management, mergers and acquisitions, litigation, etc.\n\nA recent revelation in integrated marketing communication is the change in the role of the customer within the business world. Due to the fast-paced growth of technology, customers are rapidly gaining more power through forums such as word of mouth; now with capabilities of reaching a much wider audience through the use of social media. Recognizing this power shift, organizations have begun to re-evaluate their typical marketing strategies and customer approaches from the traditional customer-focused attitude to the wide-spreading customer-centric method in order to develop a more integrated strategy.\n\nA customer-focused approach can be defined as \"when an organization learns more about the habits of the customer so that they can identify opportunities for cross-selling etc\" (Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). While this type of approach can be viewed as entirely satisfactory, Kliatchko (2008) introduced a contrasting concept which concentrates on \"working from the outside in\" and promotes a different perspective on organizations. When an organization adopts a customer-centric technique, they forgo the view that customers are only passive receivers of marketing techniques and focus on listening to what their needs are and striving to satisfy them; integrating the customer into the process (Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). Many organizations are yet to relinquish such control, as shown by research conducted by \"Campaign\" magazine, which can only be suspected to be due to the fear that it could potentially diminish the marketing profession (Laurie & Mortimer, 2011). This view, however, is rebutted by Saihtiri et al. (2014) who claims that \"achieving superiority in customer-centric performance is then rewarded through stronger brand performance in the marketplace\".\n\n\n"}

Nonetheless, she chartered her family-owned LVN Pictures into a dominant position in post-World War II Philippine cinema. In addition, de Leon was one of the most highly regarded Filipino businesswomen of the first half of the 20th century.\n\nHer grandson, Mike de Leon, emerged as a highly acclaimed film director beginning in the 1970s. His 1977 film \"Kung Mangarap Ka't Magising\" was dedicated to his late grandmother on the occasion of her birth centenary.\n\nShe was born Narcisa Buencamino in San Miguel, Bulacan at October 1877, the daughter of a poet and the granddaughter of a Chinese merchant. Her father died when she was five, and she was later forced to stop schooling after the fourth grade to work for a living. In her teens, she was working odd jobs as a cook and a seamstress, and she would eventually enter the business of making umbrellas. \n\nIn 1904, she married José de León, a local government official in San Miguel, with whom she would have five children. The family settled in San Miguel, Bulacan.\n\nThe de León couple ventured into the rice production business, and soon would be recognized as among the leading rice producers in Luzon. By the 1920s, the couple would own several high-valued real properties in Bulacan, Manila, and other prime locations within Luzon. They also engaged in philanthropic activities and donated a hospital to their hometown of San Miguel. \n\nDe León was widowed in 1934. She moved her family to Manila, took charge of the family business, and refocused it towards real estate. It was said that the business soared to new heights when she took full control after her husband's death. She would also become the first woman appointed to the board of directors of a government corporation when she was named by President Manuel Quezon to the board of the National Rice and Corn Corporation.\n\nIn the 1950s, De León would be among the organizing shareholders of Republic Cement Corporation, which soon became among the leading cement producers in the country.\n\nAfter her husband's death, de León was urged by her brother and some friends to invest in the Filipino film industry. She agreed, and in 1938, her family, along with the Villongco and Navoa families, contributed capital to establish a film studio. The company was named LVN Pictures, the name taken from the respective initials of the three founding families. Apart from de Leon, the two other principal founding partners of LVN Pictures were Carmen Villongco and Eleuterio Navoa Sr.\n\nLVN broke into the Philippine film industry with the successful release of its first feature, Carlos Vander Tolosa's musical \"Giliw Ko\", released in 1939. De León was elected president of LVN Pictures in 1940, and she eventually bought out the shares of her other partners, gaining full control over the studio. \"Giliw Ko\" was followed with another successful film, Manuel Conde's \"Ibong Adarna\" (1941), which featured the first color sequence in a Filipino film and was the first local film to earn more than a million pesos. However, LVN Pictures was forced to close shop upon the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941. It resumed operations after the Liberation of Manila in 1945, and produced the first post-war Filipino movie, \"Orasang Ginto\" (1946). In 1949, LVN produced the first full-color Filipino feature film, \"Batalyon XIII\". Dissatisfied by the color-processing of that film, De León bought her own color laboratory for LVN. LVN Pictures saw the peak of its success in the decade following the war, hosting a stable of the most prominent film stars who had joined its studios such as Rogelio de la Rosa. In addition to producing commercially successful films, LVN also featured critically acclaimed prestige films such as Lamberto Avellana's \"Anak Dalita\" (1956), which was named Best Film at the 1956 Asia-Pacific Film Festival. In the late 1950s, LVN capitalized on the unexpected stardom of one of its contract players, the singer Diomedes Maturan who emerged as the top box-office draw of 1958–1959.\n\nDuring her years at the helm of LVN Pictures, de León retained absolute control over the operations of the studio and of the films it produced. She personally read and approved the final scripts prior to production, later with the assistance of her son Manuel. Her personal tastes dictated the themes of LVN films. Reflecting her upbringing and age, she was partial to rural romances and stories based on the traditional forms of awit and corrido, and populated her movies with Philippine folk dances. She resisted copying Hollywood trends and insisted on injecting Filipino culture into LVN films.\n\nDevoutly Catholic, she demanded that each of LVN's films contain a moral lesson. She disallowed sex scenes and permitted only love scenes that featured no more than a peck on the cheek.\n\nHer idiosyncrasies aside, de Leon used the phrase \"Kung ano ang kikita\" (\"Whatever makes money\") to justify the choices of scripts LVN adapted into film. As a result, she resisted making \"prestige films\" that delved into socially conscious issues. She was hesitant to produce Avellana's bleak drama \"Anak Dalita\", and only did so at the insistence of her son, Manuel. The film earned poorly, but received several international awards which failed to mollify de Leon. She told her son, \"Ano ngayon ang gagawin ninyo sa mga kopang iyan? Makakain ninyo ba iyan?\" (\"What will you do with all those trophies? Can you be fed with those?\")\n\nDe León was known for her acumen in selecting and cultivating stars. This was manifested early on in the casting of the very first LVN film, \"Giliw Ko\". De Leon was instrumental in the casting of the then-unknown Mila del Sol in a romantic leading role, over the objection of director Vander Tolosa who felt that the 12-year-old actress was too young for the part. Del Sol would be but the first of many Filipino actors whom de Leon would \"discover\" and groom for stardom. Among the other discoveries of de Leon and LVN Pictures were Charito Solis, Nida Blanca, Armando Goyena, Luz Valdez, Delia Razon, and Mario Montenegro. Razon and Montenegro were signed by LVN after De Leon espied them in bit roles in other films.\n\nDe León was a fiery disciplinarian whom, it was joked, would fall ill when she had no one to scold. She maintained a strict supervision over the behavior of her stars, restraining their spending habits by withholding portions of their salaries until their withheld pay was sufficient to buy a new house or car. De León though would periodically hand out cash advances to LVN actresses so they could purchase new gowns. She would involve herself into the personal lives of her stars, engineering for example, the reconcillation between Nestor de Villa and his father, with whom he had become estranged after he disapproved of his becoming an actor. She frequently invited many of her actors to her Quezon City home along Broadway Street. De León was also willing to help in manually sewing the costumes of her actresses. \n\nIn line with her frugal nature, De León was hesitant to spend on publicity for LVN films. Instead, she would develop \"love team\" tandems among her stars, such as Nestor de Villa and Nida Blanca, and encourage them to \"Magpa-chismis kayo.\" (\"Make gossip for yourselves.\")\n\nDe León was known for her extreme humility.\"Filipinos in History Vol. 3\", page 70</ref> She favored her simple rural attire even when attending the most lavish receptions, and would immediately deflect any praises directed at her. She insisted on using an old diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz even after it had fallen out of fashion and in disrepair. De León also continued her philanthropic activities, providing for a school building to her native San Miguel, contributing to the renovation of the San Miguel Church, and even donating parcels of land in Bulacan and Cabanatuan to the needy.\n\nDespite her financial success, de Leon never learned to read English and could only speak the language at a most rudimentary level. She was however, well-versed in Spanish and Tagalog.\n\nDespite the box-office success of the films of LVN Pictures in the 1940s and 1950s, it was unable to sustain financial liquidity, and by 1961, it stopped producing movies and redirected its operations for post-production services. Despite being in her eighties, De León continued on as a film producer with Dalisay Pictures, an independent production outfit. She likewise attended to her other businesses and was active until the week before her death at age 88 in 1966. De Leon is buried at the Manila North Cemetery.\n\n"}

It is the equivalent of what many cities call their downtown, although in New Orleans \"downtown\" or \"down town\" was historically used to mean all portions of the city downriver from Canal Street (in the direction of flow of the Mississippi River). In recent decades, however, use of the catch-all \"downtown\" adjective to describe neighborhoods downriver from Canal Street has largely ceased, having been replaced in usage by individual neighborhood names (such as Bywater).\n\nOriginally developed as the largely-residential Faubourg Ste. Marie (\"English:\" St. Mary Suburb) in the late 18th century, the modern Central Business District is today a dynamic, mixed-use neighborhood, the home of professional offices in skyscrapers, specialty and neighborhood retail stores, numerous restaurants and clubs, and thousands of residents inhabiting restored, historic commercial and industrial buildings.\n\nThe Central Business District is located at and has an elevation of . As is true of most of metropolitan New Orleans, the parts of the district nearer the river are higher in elevation than areas further removed from it. According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of . of which is land and (10.17%) of which is water.\n\n\nThe City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of the Central Business District as these streets: Iberville Street, Decatur Street, Canal Street, the Mississippi River, the New Orleans Morial Convention Center, Julia Street, Magazine Street, the Pontchartrain Expressway, South Claiborne Avenue, Cleveland Avenue, South Derbigny Street and North Derbigny Street.\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 3,435 inhabitants of the census tracts best corresponding to the boundaries of the New Orleans Downtown Development District. The population density was 1,692 /mi² (664 /km²). Another 4,142 inhabitants of the adjacent French Quarter neighborhood were recorded in the 2000 Census. The CBD, its subdistricts (e.g., the Warehouse District), and the bordering neighborhoods of Tremé, the French Quarter, and the Lower Garden District possessed 21,630 residents, according to the 2000 Census.\n\nStreets in the Central Business District (originally \"Faubourg Ste. Marie\") were initially platted in the late 18th century, representing the first expansion of New Orleans beyond its original French Quarter footprint. Significant investment began in earnest following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, as people from other parts of the United States flocked to the city. Consequently, the district began to be referred to as the American Sector.\n\nWhile traditionally Canal Street was viewed as the dividing line between the French Quarter and the American Sector, legally both sides of Canal Street are today considered part of the Central Business District for zoning and regulatory purposes. Through the 19th and into the 20th century, the Central Business District continued developing almost without pause. By the mid-20th century, most professional offices in the region were located downtown, the hub of a well-developed public transit system.\n\nCanal Street was the primary retail destination for New Orleanians, as well as for residents of the surrounding region. Local and regional department stores Maison Blanche, D.H. Holmes, Godchaux's, Gus Mayer, Labiche's, Kreeger's, and Krauss anchored numerous well-known specialty retailers, such as Rubenstein Bros., Adler's Jewelry, Koslow's, Rapp's, and Werlein's Music. National retailers, like Kress, Woolworth, and Walgreens were present alongside local drugstore K&B. Sears operated a large store one block off Canal, on Baronne Street.\n\nBookstores, theaters, and movie palaces also abounded, with the neon marquees of the Saenger, Loews State, RKO Orpheum, Joy, and Civic theaters nightly casting multi-colored lights onto surrounding sidewalks.\n\nIn the 1950s, six-lane Loyola Avenue was constructed as an extension of Elk Place, cutting a swath through a low-income residential district and initially hosting the city's new civic center complex. The late-1960s widening of Poydras Street was undertaken to create another six-lane central area circulator for vehicular traffic, as well as to accommodate modern high-rise construction. The City of New Orleans partook in transforming the district from 1973 to 1993, in a collaboration between public and private sectors to spark active community participation.\n\nThe portion of the CBD closer to the Mississippi River and upriver from Poydras Street is known as the Warehouse District, because it was heavily devoted to warehousing and manufacturing before shipping became containerized. The 1984 World's Fair drew attention to the then semi-derelict district, resulting in steady investment and redevelopment from the mid-1980s onward. Many of the old 19th-century warehouses have been converted into hotels, restaurants, condominiums, and art galleries.\n\nNotable structures in the CBD include the Greek Revival Gallier Hall (the city's former city hall); the Mercedes-Benz Superdome; the New Orleans Arena; the city's present-day, International style city hall; and One Shell Square, the city's tallest building and headquarters for Royal Dutch Shell's Gulf of Mexico Exploration and Production. Other significant attractions include the postmodern Piazza d'Italia, Harrah's Casino, the World Trade Center New Orleans, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, St. Patrick's Church, the Hibernia Bank Building, and the former New Orleans Cotton Exchange.\n\nThe principal public park in the CBD is Lafayette Square, upon which face both Gallier Hall and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Other public spaces include Duncan Plaza, Elk Place, the Piazza d'Italia, Lee Circle, Mississippi River Heritage Park, Spanish Plaza, and the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Plaza.\n\nMuseums include the National World War II Museum, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the Louisiana Children's Museum, the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center and Confederate Memorial Hall.\n\nNew Orleans CBD was one of the few areas of New Orleans that escaped the catastrophic flooding of 2005's Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe New Orleans City Hall and surrounding structures, including the \"circa\"-1960, architecturally award-winning Main Branch of the New Orleans Public Library face Duncan Plaza, an exercise in 1950s-style urban renewal embodying then-mayor Chep Morrison's desire to create a modern civic center. The New Orleans Civic Center is today much diminished, with the Louisiana Supreme Court building having been torn down in the wake of the court's 2004 departure for the French Quarter, the Louisiana State office building having suffered the same fate, and Duncan Plaza itself having been fenced off.\n\nThe United States Postal Service operates the New Orleans Main Post Office at 701 Loyola Avenue in the CBD. \nThe Union Passenger Terminal is the terminus for three of Amtrak's long-distance trains, the City of New Orleans, the Crescent and, since 2005, the Sunset Limited (with the elimination, due to Katrina damage, of the eastbound portion of the Sunset Limited route), and also offers inter-city bus service via Greyhound Lines.\n\nInterstate Highway access is provided by I-10, via the Claiborne and Pontchartrain Expressways. When I-10 curves to the east by the Louisiana Superdome and becomes the Claiborne Expressway, elevated above N. Claiborne Avenue, the Pontchartrain Expressway continues as U.S. Route 90 Business and crosses the Mississippi River on the twin-bridge Crescent City Connection.\n\nSignificant thoroughfares in the CBD include St. Charles Avenue, Camp Street, Carondelet Street, Gravier Street, Poydras Street, Tchoupitoulas Street, Howard Avenue, and Canal Street. Prior to the 1980s, the intersection of Gravier and Carondelet streets was the \"de facto\" heart of the city's financial district. Though still a vibrant area, that part of the CBD witnessed the migration of much business slightly upriver to Poydras Street, as many modern high-rise office towers were constructed there in the 1970s and 1980s. The widening of Loyola Avenue, Poydras Street and O'Keefe Avenue aimed to simultaneously create an effective downtown circulator high capacity road network for automobile traffic and make room for large-scale redevelopment (e.g., Duncan Plaza, Superdome). However, many of the development sites created in the wake of these improvements were never built upon, leaving a noticeable and unfortunate quantity of surface parking lots along these widened streets.\n\nEntergy, the region's sole Fortune 500 firm, maintains its headquarters in the CBD, as does Reily Foods Company, which markets Luzianne products and Standard Coffee. Other local companies headquartered downtown include McMoRan Exploration, Pan American Life Insurance, Superior Energy Services, TurboSquid, iSeatz, Historic Restoration Inc. (HRI Properties), Tidewater Marine, Energy Partners Ltd., Intermarine, IMTT, International Coffee Corp., and The Receivables Exchange.\n\nThe CBD also hosts the New Orleans I.P., an \"Intellectual Property\", home to numerous creative industries firms, and numerous bioscience companies are established at the New Orleans BioInnovation Center, located within BioDistrict New Orleans.\n\nThe regional economic alliance Greater New Orleans, Inc. (GNO Inc.), the New Orleans metropolitan area's lead economic development entity for the ten-parish New Orleans region, is also headquartered downtown, as is the New Orleans Business Alliance (NOLA BA), the public-private partnership agency leading economic development efforts for the city proper.\n\nThe World Trade Center of New Orleans (WTCNO) has been located in the CBD since its establishment in 1943. The WTCNO facilitates the addition of wealth and jobs in Louisiana through international trade, economic development, and allied activities by supporting a prosperous international business climate in Louisiana.\n\nThe Consulate of Mexico in New Orleans is located in the CBD. The consulate re-opened in that location in 2008 because of the dramatic increase in the local Mexican immigrant population, many of whom arrived in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to assist in the city's rebuilding.\n\nIn addition to Mexico, France maintains a consulate in downtown New Orleans, a reflection of the long-standing ties between that nation and Louisiana, and of France's role as the founder of New Orleans in 1718.\n\nAt one time the Consulate-General of Japan in New Orleans was located in the Entergy Tower. In 2006 Japan announced that it was moving the consulate to Nashville, Tennessee. The Japanese Government relocated the mission to be close to industries and operations owned by Japanese companies.\n\nHonorary consuls for numerous other nations may also be found within the CBD.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36702440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36702440", "title": "Newtown Pery, Limerick", "text": "Newtown Pery, Limerick\n\nNewtown Pery is an area of central Limerick, Ireland, and forms the main city centre (or CBD) of the city. The district is known for its Georgian architectural heritage and is the core area of Limerick's Georgian Quarter. It is one of the three towns that make up modern-day Limerick City Centre, the other two being the older \"Englishtown & Irishtown\" which date from the medieval period. Newtown Pery houses the largest collection of Georgian townhouses in Ireland outside of Dublin. In 1837, Samuel Lewis in his \"Topographical Dictionary of Ireland\" described Newtown Pery as ‘one of the handsomest towns in Ireland’.\n\nPrior to the development of Newtown Pery, the historical City of Limerick was situated just north of the present day city centre, stretching from King John's Castle towards where St. John's Cathedral is today. The city was made up of two distinct towns; Englishtown (populated by Old English settlers) located on the historical island city and Irishtown (populated by natives) located on the southern bank of the Abbey River. The two towns were connected by one bridge \"Baal's Bridge\" over the Abbey River, while \"Thomond Bridge\" beside King John's Castle was a major crossing point of the River Shannon from \"Englishtown\" into modern-day County Clare. As with most cities of this time, Limerick was heavily fortified and walled and the streets were characteristically narrow, winding & cramped. Prior to the construction of Newtown Pery, Limerick was also beginning to exhibit some early Georgian styles within the old city. Examples surviving today include; the \"Old Bishop's Palace\" at \"Castle Street\" & at \"John's Square\" (Limerick's first example of fashionable architecture and civic spaces). Early photographs of the old city areas also show the old (pre-Georgian) continental & Dutch gabled styled townhouses as being altered somewhat to appear more Georgian. Very few of these survive today. Originally the land south of the medieval city that was to become Newtown Pery was owned by the Franciscans and known as \"South Priors Land\". Following the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII this land was granted to Edmund Sexton of whom Edmund Sexton Pery was a descendant and on whom much of Georgian Limerick is credited.\n\nFollowing the turbulent years of the 17th century, Limerick began to prosper in the 18th century and was completely transformed into the city it is today. Easy access from most parts of Ireland facilitated by the River Shannon & the opening of canals enabled Limerick to become the main port city on the western side of Ireland, which in turn brought much prosperity to the city and to its merchants and landowners with trade between Britain and America.\n\nThe boundaries of the city of Limerick, where the municipal corporation had authority, were smaller than the county of the city of Limerick, where the city grand jury had parallel authority. The area within the county of the city but outside the city proper was termed the city liberties. The development of Newtown Pery can be attributed to the work of Edmund Sexton Pery (created Viscount Pery in 1785) and his plan for the development of a new town on lands he owned in the south liberties of the city. In 1769, he commissioned the Irish engineer Christopher Colles to design a town plan on his estate which has since become known as \"Newtown Pery\". Colles devised an impressive plan for the Pery Estate which divided the estate into a grid plan of equal rectangular plots & length and of a distinctive architectural unity which still defines the city centre to this day. The town was built in stages as Pery sold off leases to builders and developers who built 4 and 5 story townhouses in the Georgian fashion with long wide and elegant streets in grid plan design with O'Connell Street (originally known as George's Street) as its centre, which was mostly in accordance with Colles' plan. The earliest houses are located along Bank Place, Rutland Street, Patrick Street which were built by the Arthur family - a prominent Limerick family during the 18th century. Some of the finest examples of Georgian Architecture can be seen at the Crescent area and Pery Square. The Custom's House (Hunt Museum), designed by Italian architect Davis Ducart, is also one of the city's finest examples of Georgian Architecture.\n\nBy the turn of the 19th Century, Newtown Pery was rapidly growing as most fashionable area of the city. In 1807 its leading residents secured a private act of the UK parliament to establish a body of improvement commissioners as municipal authority for the civil parish of St Michael's, within which Newtown Pery was located. The commissioners were abolished in 1853 when the area was absorbed into Limerick city. One brake on the town's development was that the only crossing point on the Shannon remained at Thomond Bridge in the old and now less fashionable Englishtown district. In 1835, a new bridge was built over the Shannon connecting the west directly with Newtown Pery. It was originally called Wellesley Bridge after Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland when the act to pay for it was passed. It cemented Newtown Pery's position as Limerick's premier urban district as connections to the area improved. The five-arch bridge was designed by Alexander Nimmo based on the Pont de Neuilly in Paris. In 1882 it was replaced with the current Sarsfield Bridge.\n\nFrom its development Newtown Pery has served as Limerick's CBD. It is also the city's main retail district which is centered on O'Connell Street, William Street and the adjoining streets. In addition to the quality of the Georgian heritage in the district, another striking feature of the development is the grid plan layout of the streets in the area running north/south and east/west in similar fashion and design as found in New York City, Philadelphia, Glasgow, Bristol & Berlin albeit on a smaller scale. This distinguishes Limerick's Georgian stock to the other major Irish Georgian development in Dublin, as Limerick's terraces are more uniform. This is due to the fact that the Pery owned all the land that was developed and it enabled a single development plan.\n\nLimerick continued to expand following the Act of Union and into the early 19th Century, however, Pery's plan for the city was never fully realised. It was intended that the city would continue further southwards however a crippling economic decline in Ireland caused by the Great Irish Famine put an end to the development. The terrace at Pery Square was the last development of the great Georgian expansion of Limerick. The terrace itself was intended to be part of a Georgian square enclosing the People's Park, similar to Fitzwilliam Square or Mountjoy Square in Dublin however the plans were never realised as the development coincided with the beginning of the Famine. Another distinguishing feature of Georgian Limerick to Georgian Dublin is, Newtown Pery was a completely new \"greenfield\" development. Limerick's medieval city was left completely intact and remains to this day. Unfortunately, most of the built infrastructure of medieval Limerick did not survive past the mid 20th Century following the clearance of slum living in the city. Some examples survive and the street outlines remain in \"Nicholas Street\", \"Mary Street\", \"Broad Street\", \"John Street\" & \"Mungret Street\". Much of Georgian Dublin in contrast however was undertaken by the Wide Streets Commission which almost completely rebuilt Dublin over the older medieval city.\n\nAlthough housing an important collection of Georgian architecture and acting as Limerick's city centre, unfortunately Newtown Pery's position as the one time fashionable area of the city is long over. In addition to this, its Georgian heritage has been severely compromised, in particular around the retail core of \"O'Connell Street\" & \"William street\". Economic decline & stagnation plagued Limerick during the 20th Century which saw some townhouses converted to tenements such as at \"Arthur's Quay & Bank Place\". During this time very little investment was seen in Newtown Pery, only the exodus of families & industries to new suburban districts around the city due to modern requirements. By the mid 20th century dereliction had taken its toll as the townhouses at \"Arthur's Quay\", \"Francis Street\" & \"Bank Place\" were completely lost. Lax development controls enabled the almost complete rebuilding of the northern end of O'Connell Street and replacing what were some iconic and illustrious buildings with more modernist (& perhaps less attractive) sixties style architecture. The loss of \"Todd's Department Store\" to a fire which gutted the building, the rebuilding of \"Cannock's Department Store, Royal George Hotel, AIB Bank\" amongst many more, completely altered the look of city and ultimately resulted in a loss of the districts heritage and character. Nevertheless, much of the districts Georgian townhouses remained intact, however many were converted to offices or flats while others remained unoccupied or neglected. However, despite the architectural losses & economic conditions; Newtown Pery remained the premier retail & services district for Limerick and the greater Mid-West Region well up into the late 20th and early 21st Century.\n\nEconomic stagnation in Limerick, was only broken by the Celtic Tiger in the late 20th Century. Unfortunately, Newtown Pery, still lagged behind with regards to investment & planning with exception to the riverfront of the Shannon. Suburban areas of Limerick have seen massive investments particularly in retail, which has seen the one time retail core of \"O' Connell Street & William street\" been eclipsed by massive retail developments in the suburbs. Poor planning & lack of investment has resulted in high vacancy rates & further dereliction which plagues some parts. Amongst the casualties of this poor planning has been the \"Patrick Street, Rutland Street & Ellen Street\" areas which were all part of the ill fated Opera Centre development. These streets are now almost completely derelict & vacant. Urban depression in Limerick unfortunately is not confined to these areas alone as much of central Limerick is now exhibiting the effects, mainly of heavy suburbanisation but also the effects of economic recession. The area is now a shadow of its former self as more and more businesses & retail facilities leave the city centre for the convenience of the new shopping centres.\n\nIn order to arrest the decline of Limerick's CBD and Newtown Pery in general, both Limerick City Council and national government have introduced schemes to counteract the heavy suburbanisation of the city. Amongst the most eloborate plans is the €250 million \"Limerick 2030\" plan which will see a complete redevelopment of the \"Arthur's Quay\" area into a new and modern retailing complex. It will also see the development of a higher education campus to include facilities from LIT, UL, and MIC and a refurbishment of the city's main streets. Another plan is the \"Living City Initiative\" which provides tax relief for residents who refurbish Georgian houses in designated areas. It also provides tax relief to retailers who carry out works to upgrade or re-fit their shops in the designated Georgian area. Newtown Pery is a testament to Limerick's rich & eventful past and remains one of the most important remnants of Ireland's Georgian Era.

Additionally, factors that are more likely to change in the future or more relevant to a given company will carry greater importance. For example, a company which has borrowed heavily will need to focus more on the economic factors (especially interest rates).\n\nFurthermore, conglomerate companies who produce a wide range of products (such as Sony, Disney, or BP) may find it more useful to analyze one department of its company at a time with the PESTEL model, thus focusing on the specific factors relevant to that one department.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Vaucluse between 1994 and 2011. Debnam is a former Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Minister for Western Sydney, Redfern/Waterloo and Citizenship. He also held the shadow portfolios of Infrastructure and Energy.\n\nDebnam's early years of schooling were at Frenchs Forest Public School and The Forest High School. Debnam was educated at the Royal Australian Naval College, where he graduated in 1974. He served in the Royal Australian Navy from 1972 to 1980. During his Naval career, Debnam served on many ships including the aircraft carrier , destroyer escort , destroyers and and patrol boats and . After leaving the Navy, Debnam studied at the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, where he gained an MBA. He held positions at Dalgety Farmers Limited, Hawker de Havilland and Australian Aircraft Consortium before entering politics.\n\nIn 1994 Debnam was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as Liberal member for Vaucluse. The following year the Liberal government was defeated by Labor under Bob Carr. Between 1997 and 2005 Debnam was successively Shadow Minister for Housing and for Planning and Urban Affairs, Shadow Treasurer, Shadow Minister for Transport, Shadow Minister for Police and Shadow Minister for Transport Services.\n\nFollowing John Brogden's sudden resignation as Liberal Leader in August 2005, the Deputy Leader, Barry O'Farrell, was initially the favourite to become leader, but Debnam steadily gained ground as he lobbied Liberal MPs, and on 31 August O'Farrell withdrew from the contest.\n\nOn 16 November 2006, Debnam suggested under Parliamentary Privilege that NSW Attorney-General Bob Debus was under investigation by the Police Integrity Commission. In response, the Government released a police report stating that a minister had been the subject of complaints (not an investigation), and that they were dismissed in 2003 as spurious and groundless. The report did not name the minister concerned as it was, deemed to be 'not in the public interest'. When Mr Debnam declined to provide evidence to support his claims, he was censured by Parliament for misleading the House.\n\nIt was subsequently reported that Debnam's source for the accusation was a convicted child sex offender and bank robber with a history of making unsubstantiated allegations. Opinion poll support for the Opposition leader declined markedly in the wake of the allegations, which also distracted attention from a campaign against the Government over the sacking of Ministers Milton Orkopoulos and Carl Scully.\n\nPeter Debnam led the Liberal/National coalition to defeat in the 2007 state election. The Coalition gained a total of four seats from Labor and independents—too few to significantly reduce Labor's majority. Following the election, his deputy, O'Farrell, announced he would challenge Debnam for the Liberal leadership. When it was apparent that Debnam did not have enough support to keep his post, he withdrew from the contest on 2 April 2007, effectively handing the leadership to O'Farrell. On 11 April 2007 O'Farrell appointed Debnam as opposition infrastructure and energy spokesman. He resigned in May 2008 because of his party's decision to support the Labor Government's plan to privatise the electricity system.\n\nHe retired from Parliament prior to the 2011 state election.\n\n"}
{"id": "253149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=253149", "title": "Porter's five forces analysis", "text": "Porter's five forces analysis\n\nPorter's Five Forces Framework is a tool for analyzing competition of a business. It draws from industrial organization (IO) economics to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and, therefore, the attractiveness (or lack of it) of an industry in terms of its profitability. An \"unattractive\" industry is one in which the effect of these five forces reduces overall profitability. The most unattractive industry would be one approaching \"pure competition\", in which available profits for all firms are driven to normal profit levels. The five-forces perspective is associated with its originator, Michael E. Porter of Harvard University. This framework was first published in \"Harvard Business Review\" in 1979.\n\nPorter refers to these forces as the microenvironment, to contrast it with the more general term macroenvironment. They consist of those forces close to a company that affect its ability to serve its customers and make a profit. A change in any of the forces normally requires a business unit to re-assess the marketplace given the overall change in industry information. The overall industry attractiveness does not imply that every firm in the industry will return the same profitability. Firms are able to apply their core competencies, business model or network to achieve a profit above the industry average. A clear example of this is the airline industry. As an industry, profitability is low because the industry's underlying structure of high fixed costs and low variable costs afford enormous latitude in the price of airline travel. Airlines tend to compete on cost, and that drives down the profitability of individual carriers as well as the industry itself because it simplifies the decision by a customer to buy or not buy a ticket. A few carriers--Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic is one--have tried, with limited success, to use sources of differentiation in order to increase profitability.\n\nPorter's five forces include three forces from 'horizontal' competition--the threat of substitute products or services, the threat of established rivals, and the threat of new entrants--and two others from 'vertical' competition--the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers.\n\nPorter developed his five forces framework in reaction to the then-popular SWOT analysis, which he found both lacking in rigor and \"ad hoc\". Porter's five-forces framework is based on the structure–conduct–performance paradigm in industrial organizational economics. It has been applied to try to address a diverse range of problems, from helping businesses become more profitable to helping governments stabilize industries. Other Porter strategy tools include the value chain and generic competitive strategies.\n\nProfitable industries that yield high returns will attract new firms. New entrants eventually will decrease profitability for other firms in the industry. Unless the entry of new firms can be made more difficult by incumbents, abnormal profitability will fall towards zero (perfect competition), which is the minimum level of profitability required to keep an industry in business.\n\nThe following factors can have an effect on how much of a threat new entrants may pose:\n\nA substitute product uses a different technology to try to solve the same economic need. Examples of substitutes are meat, poultry, and fish; landlines and cellular telephones; airlines, automobiles, trains, and ships; beer and wine; and so on. For example, tap water is a substitute for Coke, but Pepsi is a product that uses the same technology (albeit different ingredients) to compete head-to-head with Coke, so it is not a substitute. Increased marketing for drinking tap water might \"shrink the pie\" for both Coke and Pepsi, whereas increased Pepsi advertising would likely \"grow the pie\" (increase consumption of all soft drinks), while giving Pepsi a larger market share at Coke's expense. \n\nPotential factors:\n\nThe bargaining power of customers is also described as the market of outputs: the ability of customers to put the firm under pressure, which also affects the customer's sensitivity to price changes. Firms can take measures to reduce buyer power, such as implementing a loyalty program. Buyers' power is high if buyers have many alternatives. It is low if they have few choices. \n\nPotential factors:\n\nThe bargaining power of suppliers is also described as the market of inputs. Suppliers of raw materials, components, labor, and services (such as expertise) to the firm can be a source of power over the firm when there are few substitutes. If you are making biscuits and there is only one person who sells flour, you have no alternative but to buy it from them. Suppliers may refuse to work with the firm or charge excessively high prices for unique resources.\n\nPotential factors are:\n\nFor most industries the intensity of competitive rivalry is the major determinant of the competitiveness of the industry. Having an understanding of industry rivals is vital to successfully market a product. Positioning pertains to how the public perceives a product and distinguishes it from competitors. A business must be aware of its competitors marketing strategy and pricing and also be reactive to any changes made. \n\nPotential factors:\n\nStrategy consultants occasionally use Porter's five forces framework when making a qualitative evaluation of a firm's strategic position. However, for most consultants, the framework is only a starting point. They might use value chain or another type of analysis in conjunction. Like all general frameworks, an analysis that uses it to the exclusion of specifics about a particular situation is considered naive.\n\nAccording to Porter, the five forces framework should be used at the line-of-business industry level; it is not designed to be used at the industry group or industry sector level. An industry is defined at a lower, more basic level: a market in which similar or closely related products and/or services are sold to buyers. (See industry information.) A firm that competes in a single industry should develop, at a minimum, one five forces analysis for its industry. Porter makes clear that for diversified companies, the primary issue in corporate strategy is the selection of industries (lines of business) in which the company will compete. The average \"Fortune Global 1,000\" company competes in 52 industries .\n\nPorter's framework has been challenged by other academics and strategists. For instance, Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam claim that three dubious assumptions underlie the five forces:\n\nAn important extension to Porter's work came from Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff of Yale School of Management in the mid-1990s. Using game theory, they added the concept of complementors (also called \"the 6th force\") to try to explain the reasoning behind strategic alliances. Complementors are known as the impact of related products and services already in the market. The idea that complementors are the sixth force has often been credited to Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel Corporation. Martyn Richard Jones, while consulting at Groupe Bull, developed an augmented five forces model in Scotland in 1993. It is based on Porter's Framework and includes Government (national and regional) as well as pressure groups as the notional 6th force. This model was the result of work carried out as part of Groupe Bull's Knowledge Asset Management Organisation initiative.\n\nPorter indirectly rebutted the assertions of other forces, by referring to innovation, government, and complementary products and services as \"factors\" that affect the five forces.\n\nIt is also perhaps not feasible to evaluate the attractiveness of an industry independently of the resources that a firm brings to that industry. It is thus argued (Wernerfelt 1984) that this theory be combined with the resource-based view (RBV) in order for the firm to develop a sounder framework.\n\n\n"}

A description of a power structure would capture the way in which power or authority is distributed between people within groups such as a government, nation, institution, organization, or a society. Such structures are of interest to various fields, including sociology, government, economics, and business. A power structure may be formal and intentionally constructed to maximize values like fairness or efficiency, as in a hierarchical organization wherein every entity, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. Conversely, a power structure may be an informal set of roles, such as those found in a dominance hierarchy in which members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. A culture that is organised in a dominance hierarchy is a dominator culture, the opposite of an egalitarian culture of partnership. A visible, dominant group or elite that holds power or authority within a power structure is often referred to as being the Establishment. Power structures are fluid, with changes occurring constantly, either slowly or rapidly, evolving or revolutionary, peacefully or violently.\n\n"}

In this role, he is responsible for helping to further links between Welsh and Indian business, educational establishments and cultural organisations, as well as looking after the needs of Indian nationals living and working in Wales. In March 2015, he was appointed president of the Consular Association of Wales. \n\nAs chairman of Kidney Wales Foundation, Aggarwal campaigned and provided evidence from 2007 onwards for a deemed consent or 'soft opt out' to increase the number of organs available for transplantation and save lives. The Human Transplantation Wales Act received Royal Assent on 10 September 2013. The law came into effect on 1 December 2015. In its first year the number of patients waiting for organ donation dropped 38% from 309 in 2010/11 to 193 in 2015/16 and it was said to represent \"considerable progress\". \nIn December 2017 Theresa May called for a public consultation to extend the \"opt out\" law to England in order to reduce organ donation waiting lists \n\nHe has been a member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain since 1973, appointed a Fellow of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in November 2013. In June 2007, Aggarwal was made an OBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List in recognition of his contribution to the pharmaceutical industry and the life of the Asian community in Wales. Roy Thomas, chief Executive of the Kidney Wales charity, told the Western Mail: \"He is a very modest man but the honour is more than deserved. He has promoted the need for diversity in business. The Welsh and Asian communities should be proud of him and what he has achieved.\" \n\nHe is a lay member of the Governing Body of Cardiff University and a Board Member of the Wales Millennium Centre. In October 2011, Aggarwal was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for South Glamorgan. As well as English, he speaks Swahili, Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu.\n\nAggarwal was educated at the Duke of Gloucester Grammar School in Nairobi, Kenya, before his family emigrated to Wales in 1967. He studied A-Levels at Bath College, Somerset, from 1967-1969, then won a place at the Welsh School of Pharmacy at Cardiff University from 1969-1972. He graduated with a B.Pharms (Hons) 2.1 in Pharmacology and joined Boots UK as a graduate trainee. He rose to become one of the company's youngest-ever regional managers, looking after high-profile stores including Oxford Street, London.\n\nOn a social visit to Cardiff in 1982, he was introduced to a pharmacy on City Road and decided that he would rather run his own business rather than work for someone else. Resigning from Boots, he bought this first shop. Over the next decade, Aggarwal built up a chain of six pharmacies, and a significant business, in and around Cardiff. In 2008 Central Pharmacy, which Aggarwal still owns and operates, was awarded the Best in UK Clarins Gold Salons Award. He believes the key to good business is in customer service, telling Pharmacy Business (9 March 2011): \"I enjoy what I do. I have a lot of happiness in what we achieve. I've always had a strong head for business and I enjoy leadership and keeping customer service levels high. We want to make customers feel how we would want to feel.\"\n\nIn 2010 Aggarwal was named UK 2010 Pharmacy Business Entrepreneur of the Year. The award was presented by then Secretary of State for Health Andrew Lansley MP.\n\nAggarwal has been a staunch advocate of the benefits of community pharmacies and the support and advice they can provide to patients.\n\nIn November 2009, he wrote: \"The community pharmacy network in Wales is made up of more than 700 pharmacies, ranging from the small independent pharmacy to the larger branches of well-known chains. They are located where people work, shop and live and to many they are the most accessible part of the health service. We are all aware of the role the pharmacy plays in providing patients with 60 million-plus prescription medicines every year. But, over the years, more and more people have been recognising community pharmacies as sources of help and advice – particularly about how to lead a healthier lifestyle – and a provider of health checks.\"\n\nHe has also written about the high cost to the public purse for wasted prescription medicines in Wales - that \"costs the NHS an estimated £50million a year; enough to fund 350 nurses, 200 hip operations and more than 1,000 coronary bypass operations\" - and urged health officials to place more trust in pharmacists, writing: \"Wales has the highest prescribing rate per head of population in the UK – 22 items compared to 16 in England – meaning this is a serious issue for the Assembly Government to sort out. There are more than 700 pharmacies across Wales situated where people work, shop and live. The pharmacists working in these businesses are at the heart of decisions about the prescription and dispensing of medicines. They daily interface with prescribers, practice managers, care-home managers and patients and there is not a day that goes by when they do not identify issues which can result in ineffective or inappropriate use of medicines.\"\n\nHe is also an advocate of free prescriptions, writing os the \"inherent inequity\" of the exemption system for prescription charges.\n\nHe is Board Member of the National Pharmacy Association and of Community Pharmacy Wales [Chairman, South East Region]. He is also a Welsh Government-appointed advisor on various Health and Pharmaceutical Committees, formal member of the Ministerial Pharmacy Strategic Delivery Group, and a Board member of Bro-Taf Drug and Therapeutics Committee.\n\nIn May 2011 he was presented with the \"Outstanding Contribution to Pharmacy\" award by Community Pharmacy Wales, acknowledging his contribution to Welsh Pharmacy and to his tireless work within the charity sector.\n\nAggarwal has been Chairman (since 2007) and a trustee (since 2002) of the Kidney Wales Foundation. In June 2011 he was appointed as a Trustee of the Wales Millennium Centre. He was a fundraising committee member of the George Thomas Hospice, that provides specialist home-based nursing and practical advice, emotional and spiritual support, medical equipment, therapies and treatments for cancer patients.\n\nAggarwal has been a staunch advocate for increasing business links between Wales and other nations, especially India. India is the UK’s fourth largest inward investor, creating 5,889 jobs over the past year. It accounts for around 6% of exports from Wales, worth around £100m. According to the Assembly Government there are more than 2,000 Indian students at Welsh universities. Taking part in a US-Indian-Welsh business symposium in March 2011, Aggarwal said: \"Ensuring a commercial link with India and continued investment relations is essential if Wales is to grow on the international stage.\" \n\nIn September 2012, Aggarwal was appointed to the role by India’s High Commissioner Dr Jaimini Bhagwati during a ceremony at Cardiff’s India Centre. Talking to the South Wales Echo, Aggarwal: \"This is a special privilege that I and my family will always cherish. Wales is a dynamic small country and stronger links with the rising superpower that is India will be vital to its future prosperity. I’ll work tirelessly to build a deeper engagement between the two countries to which I and many Welsh people owe their allegiance.\" .\n\nWelsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said of the appointment: \"Raj isn’t only a personal friend to me but also to Wales. He’s been a tireless advocate for promoting our country as a place to invest and do business and travelled with me to India earlier this year to highlight what we have to offer to Indian companies. I know his appointment as Honorary Consul to Wales will be of great pride to him and I am sure he will do an excellent job.\"\n\nIn March 2015, at the organisation's Annual General Meeting, Aggarwal was appointed president of the Consular Association of Wales. The role involves working closely with the UK Government, the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Government. Aggarwal told Wales Online: \"I hope to show all the amazing strengths and fantastic attributes of Wales and its people, its commerce, education, tourism and cultural endeavours.\"\n\nHe is a Patron of the Hindu Council of Wales and the Sikh Council of Wales and was involved in years of fundraising to erect a 6ft bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi near the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff. Raj gave a speech at the unveiling ceremony on 2nd October 2017, the 148th anniversary of Gandhi's birth which was also attended by Gandhi's grandson Mr Satishkumar Dhupelia, other Indian diplomats, First Minister Carwyn Jones and Vimla Patel, Chair of the Hindu Council of Wales.\n\n\nAggarwal lives in Cardiff, with his wife Usha. He has four brothers, two of whom work in public health, and three sisters, one of whom is also a pharmacist.

{"id": "23171673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23171673", "title": "Refueling and overhaul", "text": "Refueling and overhaul\n\nIn the United States Navy, Refueling and Overhaul (ROH) refers to a lengthy process or procedure performed on nuclear-powered naval ships, which involves replacement of expended nuclear fuel with new fuel and a general maintenance fix-up, renovation, and often modernization of the entire ship. In theory, such a process could simply involve only refueling or only an overhaul, but nuclear refueling is usually combined with an overhaul. An ROH usually takes one to two years for submarines and up to almost three years for an aircraft carrier, performed at a naval shipyard. Time periods between ROHs on a ship have varied historically from about 5–20 years (for submarines) to up to 25 years (for s). For modern submarines and aircraft carriers, ROHs are typically carried out about midway through their operating lifespan. There are also shorter maintenance fix-ups called \"availabilities\" for ships periodically at shipyards. A particularly lengthy refueling, maintenance, and modernization process for a nuclear aircraft carrier can last up to almost three years and be referred to as a Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH).\n\nAt a shipyard, a ship to undergo ROH goes into a drydock, which is then closed off from the sea. Water is evacuated from the drydock with keel blocks pre positioned under the hull, so the ship's keel area will rest on the blocks as the water is pumped out. At the end of the ROH, the drydock is refilled with water so the ship can be re-floated and removed from the dock. \n\nTo start ROH, operating procedures are used to shut down and cool down the propulsion power plant to bring it to desired temperatures, pressures, and other conditions. During the ROH, ship's Navy crew stand shutdown watches, and civilian shipyard workers do much of the repair, maintenance, and installation work. During an ROH, all personnel in a maintenance work area are commonly required to wear a hard hat.\n\nLand-based naval reactor prototype plants have also undergone similar refueling and overhauls, not at a shipyard but at whatever facility they are located.\n\nIn a nuclear-powered ship, the nuclear fuel is essentially a solid inside a reactor core which is inside the ship's nuclear reactor. Once a reactor core has gone critical, meaning it has been used during a reactor operation, highly radioactive nuclear fission products have formed in the core, and the core has become highly radioactive. Refueling involves taking the expended core out of the reactor and putting in a new core with fresh nuclear fuel. Because it is so radioactive, removing a core with spent nuclear fuel from a reactor requires elaborate radiological handling precautions. All materials that came in contact with the critical core, including the internal surfaces and coolant water, are considered radioactively contaminated and require special radiological handling and disposal precautions. In addition to radiological training and qualification required for working in radiation areas or with radioactive materials or contamination, radiation exposure to workers is monitored to ensure maximum exposure limits are not exceeded.\n\nThe overhaul commonly includes extensive maintenance and renovation work and checks of various systems and equipment aboard the ship. A major overhaul also typically includes upgrading various systems and equipment to modernize them; for example, old analog electrical equipment may be replaced by new digital electronic equipment. The work for such overhauls is typically planned out by engineers well in advance and new equipment is obtained for any replacements or installations.\n\nAn example of renovation work done during refueling and overhauls of submarines is the conversion of a fleet ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) to a guided missile submarine (SSGN). Such a conversion consists of taking the 24 ballistic missiles and their silos out of the missile section in the submarine, and replacing them with 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and special operations force insertion platforms which can carry up to 66 special operations personnel. The first four s have undergone such conversions during their midlife refueling and overhauls. For more details, see .\n\nDuring an overhaul, an extensive testing program is conducted. Numerous test procedures that have been written are followed, data is recorded as required, and logs of the testing are kept. Tests that can be conducted include: radiography to test critical welds, testing of fluid systems and other pressure boundaries which includes hydrostatic testing to detect any leaks, and testing of electrical and mechanical setpoints for various types of equipment such as sensor input setpoints for various kinds of automatic trips and safety valve relief pressure setpoints. At the finish of the ROH, the testing data records are bound and retained as a permanent documentation record resulting from the ROH.\n\nAs the ship is readied, toward the end of the ROH, the power plant is warmed or brought back up to the desired operating temperature and pressure so it can be started when ready.\n\nRefueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) is a process for refueling and upgrading nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in the US Navy. The nuclear reactors that power some aircraft carriers typically use up their nuclear fuel about halfway through their desired 50-year life spans. Because carriers can last so long before being retired, they are refueled and refurbished with an RCOH to extend their usable lifetime. At the same time a ship is refueled, it is given a complex overhaul in which broken, worn or obsolete parts are repaired or replaced and systems are modernized. The modernization typically includes an upgrade of ship’s combat systems and warfighting capabilities, its internal distribution systems are upgraded, and allowance is made for future upgrades over the ship’s remaining operational service life. Given the size of an aircraft carrier and the number of systems and subsystems it has, an RCOH is extremely complex, costly (several billion dollars), and time-consuming. Each RCOH is planned to take 46 months.\n\n"}
{"id": "18663033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18663033", "title": "Side letter", "text": "Side letter\n\nA side letter or side agreement is a collective bargaining agreement that is not part of the underlying or primary collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which the parties to the contract use to reach agreement on issues the CBA does not cover, to clarify issues in the CBA, or to modify the CBA (permanently or temporarily). One may distinguish side letters from \"side settlements\" or \"settlement agreements\", which settle a dispute arising from the underlying CBA. In rare cases, bargaining parties may use a side letter to adjust the focus of the contract if the parties are not yet ready or willing to adapt the contract formally.\n\nUnder the law of contracts, a side letter has the same force as the underlying contract. However, the courts may invalidate side letters in conflict with the main collective bargaining agreement. The terms of the CBA govern interpretation of side letters. In the United States, several appellate courts have held that in disputes where side letters do not contain conflict resolution procedures, the parties must use the underlying collective bargaining agreement's dispute resolution mechanism (in these cases, arbitration) to resolve the dispute.\n\nThe range of issues side letters covers is wide. In some cases, side letters have driven national labour law policy. For example, in the United States, a side letter guaranteeing employer neutrality during union elections in newly acquired plants, subsidiaries, or divisions led to a federal lawsuit over the legality of the agreement in 2002 and a major decision by the National Labor Relations Board revising federal labour policy in 2007.\n\nIn Australia, side letters are becoming increasingly common due to the changes in federal labour law the WorkChoices Act created. WorkChoices limits the collective bargaining agreements that parties can register for eligibility for workplace tribunals enforcement, and also requires CBAs be strictly limited to work-related issues. The inclusion of even minor non-workplace-related clauses (such as dues check-off) can render a CBA unenforceable. In response, many unions and employers are using side letters to reach agreement on non-workplace-related matters, and not registering these side-letters with the federal government—relying on common law to enforce the side letters.\n\n"}
{"id": "1581393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1581393", "title": "Tiit Vähi", "text": "Tiit Vähi\n\nTiit Vähi (born 10 January 1947) is an Estonian politician who was Prime Minister of Estonia from 1995 to 1997. He was also acting Prime Minister for several months during 1992 under the transitional government.\n\nBorn in Kaagjärve parish, Estonia, Vähi graduated from the Tallinn Technical University with a degree in Engineering. From the time of his graduation until 1992, he served in several top managerial post with the Valga Trucking Company.\n\nDuring the Estonian national independence movement, Vähi was among the organisers of the Estonian Popular Front, and led its regional committee in Valga County. In 1989, he was appointed Minister for Transport and Communications, a post that he held until January 1992. During his tenure as Transport Minister, he forged close ties with the transport ministries of the Nordic countries and improved relations with the other two Baltic States on transport related issues. He transferred control of Estonia's airports, railways and sea ports, under the control Moscow, to the Estonian authorities.\n\nShortly after Estonia's return to independence in 1991, Vähi was appointed as the Government's special representative to north-eastern Estonia, a region inhabited by a majority of ethnic Russians.\n\nOn 30 January 1992, Vähi became the second post-Soviet Prime Minister of Estonia, succeeding Edgar Savisaar. During this first stint as Prime Minister, he embarked upon a vast programme to transform the country's economy from its being centrally controlled into a more free market economy. His government also introduced the Estonian currency, the Kroon, in June 1992. He also founded the Estonian Privatisation Agency, which embarked on the privatisation of government-owned assets to the private sector. \nAs agreed when he assumed the post Prime Minister in the transition government, Vähi did not participate in the parliamentary elections on 20 September 1992.\n\nIn 1993, he was elected Chairman of the Estonian Coalition Party. The parliamentary elections of March 1995 gave victory to the KMÜ coalition, comprising the Estonian Coalition Party and the People's Union of Estonia Parties. As leader of the Estonian Coalition Party, Vähi was asked by President Lennart Meri to form a government. Appointed Prime Minister for the second time in his career, he formed a coalition government of the KMÜ and the Estonian Centre Party, which was sworn in on 17 April 1995.\n\nHis second term as Prime Minister was quite rocky. On 11 October 1995 several ministers resigned from the cabinet, causing the Estonian Centre Party to withdraw from the government coalition. On 7 November 1995, Vähi reformed the government, this time with the help of the Estonian Reform Party. This collaboration lasted less than a year; on 20 November 1996, six ministers, including then-Foreign Minister Siim Kallas, resigned, causing a collapse of the collaboration between the Coalition Party and the Reform Party. On 1 December 1996, Vähi once again reformed the government; however, this time, he only used members of his own party, thus greatly reducing its ability to retain power. On 7 February 1995, Vähi survived a no-confidence vote, 46–45. Feeling pressure from within his own party, he resigned on 25 February 1997. Three days later, on 27 February, President Lennart Meri named Mart Siimann as the new Prime Minister. By 2001, the Estonian Coalition Party, the party that Vähi had helped to form, and which presided over the Estonian government from 1995 to 1999, disbanded. He is currently a member of the free-market liberal Reform Party but is not active in politics and has concentrated on his career as a businessman. He has expressed opinion that Estonia needs to improve relations with Russia.\n"}
{"id": "43966794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43966794", "title": "Trademark Clearinghouse", "text": "Trademark Clearinghouse\n\nThe Trademark Clearinghouse is a database of validated and registered trademarks established by ICANN to assist trademark holders prevent infringing behavior in the Domain Name System. In combination with the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS), it is the second significant attempt by ICANN to handle the \"Trademark Dilemma\". The first attempt was the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.\n\nThe Trademark Clearinghouse is not a trademark office. Rights holders who register their marks with the Trademark Clearinghouse must still register with their country's trademark office. The primary purpose of the Trademark Clearinghouse is to maintain a global database of verified trademarks for the Domain Name System.\n\nThe Trademark Clearinghouse is strictly for second-level domain names. Other mechanisms exist to protect trademark in the new gTLDs themselves. All new gTLD registries are required to use the Trademark Clearinghouse and URS for protection of Second-level domains.\n\nOne of the initial tasks of ICANN when it was formed was to deal with the so-called \"Trademark Dilemma\", which is determining the appropriate balance of rights between domain name holders and trademark owners. So in December 1999 ICANN launched the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy. Starting in 2008 ICANN began a new program to launch many more new Generic top-level domains. As part of this program ICANN envisioned a replacement program for the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.\n\nOn March 6, 2009 ICANN commissioned 18 intellectual property experts from around the world entitled the Implementation Recommendation Team (IRT). They produced a report on May 29, 2009 with numerous recommendations to protect intellectual property rights holders. Most importantly, the report recommended an Intellectual Property Clearinghouse be created in concert with a Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS).\n\nThe recommendation of the Intellectual Property Clearinghouse became the basis for the Trademark Clearinghouse and together with the URS eventually replaced the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.\n\nOn May 28, 2010 ICANN published the Trademark Clearinghouse Proposal. The proposal emerged from an ICANN meeting held in Nairobi between the 7th and 12 March 2010. In the proposal both the Trademark Clearinghouse and the Universal Rapid Suspension program were proposed as possible replacements for the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.\n\nIn November 2012 ICANN organized meetings in Los Angeles and Brussels to consider the implementation of the Trademark Clearinghouse for new top level domains. The outcome of these meetings was a straw man proposal for the Trademark Clearinghouse.\n\nIn March 2013 the Trademark Clearinghouse launched.\n\nThe new gTLD program initially faced heavy criticism from many brand owners. Specifically, the Association of National Advertisers created an organization called Coalition for Responsible Internet Domain Oversight (CRIDO) and began lobbying ICANN to halt the new gTLD rollout. The brand owners saw the creation of more gTLDs as a further cost to protect their trademarks from cybersquatting. They wanted strong trademark protections built into the new gTLD program.\n\nMilton Mueller, a professor at Syracuse University and frequent critic of ICANN, argues that the creation of the Trademark Clearinghouse was entirely hijacked by the advertising and intellectual property stakeholders, primarily by groups like the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). He argues that ICANN staff ignored its established bottom up processes when it did not suit them, and instead implemented the straw man proposal against the wishes of the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO), Noncommercial Stakeholders Group (NCSG), and numerous other stakeholders.\n\nDNS news site DomainIncite.com has also been critical of the Trademark Clearinghouse development process.\n\nMany non-commercial observers have criticised ICANN for the way in which the Trademark Clearinghouse was developed. Most of this criticism has stemmed from a lack of openness concerning the proceedings at the Los Angeles and Brussels meetings. In response to this criticism ICANN's Ombudsman opened a probe into the closed door nature of these meetings in December 2012.\n\nRobin Gross, chair of ICANN's Noncommercial Stakeholders Group (NCSG) claimed that the NCSG was largely ignored during the proceedings, while the Business Constituency and Intellectual Property Constituency were overly represented. Using ICANN's Documentary Information Disclosure Program (DIDP) process, ICANN's version of a FOIA request, the NCSG requested all information concerning the Los Angeles and Brussels meetings. In response, the NCSG received no new information\n\nThe NCSG criticised the Brussels meeting immediately prior to it. In response, Fadi Chehade, CEO of ICANN, explained the purpose of the meeting in Brussels as simply an informal white board brainstorming session. After the meeting Chehade wrote a blog post detailing what happened at the Brussels meeting.\n\nOn June 25, 2014, ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) issued a comminuque entitled, \"Protection of Red Cross / Red Crescent Names\". The communique exempted the 'terms and names associated with the Red Cross and Red Crescent' from trademark protection while still affording them protected status. The communique advised that the names not be subject to policy considerations relating to trademark, because they cannot receive adequate treatment under trademark law. Instead the permanent protection of these names should be confirmed.\n\nIn response, ICANN's Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) suggested the names simply be added to the Trademark Clearinghouse. The matter is still being debated.\n\nThe Trademark Clearinghouse is not a rights protection mechanism itself. Instead, additional mechanisms coupled with the Trademark Clearinghouse help trademark owners protect their rights. There are two special time periods where trademark holders are given special treatment, ongoing notification services, and the URS. There are also differentiated services offered by specific registries. These build on the Trademark Clearinghouse to afford special treatment to trademark holders with verified trademarks in the Trademark Clearinghouse.\n\nThe sunrise period is a time period immediately prior to the launching of a TLD. Trademark Clearinghouse registrants receive priority access to reserve domain names associated with their trademarks before general access. New gTLD registries are required to offer a sunrise period of at least 30 days.\n\nDuring the claims period registrants attempting to register a second-level domain name under a TLD which utilizes the Trademark Clearinghouse will receive a warning if the name matches an entry in the Trademark Clearinghouse. If the registrant registers the name anyway, the rights owner will receive a notification from the Trademark Claims system. The claims period is required to last at least 90 days after the initial launch of the new gTLD.\n\nRights holders with trademarks registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse can opt in to receive additional notifications after the claims period expires. Holders will be notified of exact matches to names they have registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse. This service is optional and free.\n\nDomain Protected Marks List (DPML) is a service offered by specific new gTLD registry operators based on the Trademark Clearinghouse. It is not a standard service offered to rights holders registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse, nor is it standardized by ICANN. Different registries will implement DPML differently as a means of marketplace differentiation. Typically registries will offer to defensively block registrations that are more than just exact matches.\n\nAs part of the new gTLD program ICANN developed an accompanying rights protection mechanism for trademark holders called the Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS). Work on the URS started in September 2012 with an RFI issued by ICANN. It was finalized in January 2014.\n\nThe URS is not meant to replace the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy, but instead complement it. In contrast to the UDRP, the URS is meant as a lightweight, inexpensive, expedited arbitration process for resolving obvious trademark rights violations. Unlike the UDRP, successful URS claims only cause a domain name to be suspended and redirected, not seized. Also, the URS is not intended for use where facts are in question. URS decisions can take as little as one week to resolve.\n\nRegistries and registrars participating in the new gTLD program are required to implement the URS. In the context of the URS, they are called providers.\n\nEvery URS claim starts with a complaint filed by a trademark holder against a registrant of a domain name they believe to be infringing their trademark. The complainant must also pay a one time non-refundable fee of $375. Within two days of the complaint being filed an administrative review will be held by the URS provider.\n\nIf this review determines the complaint is in proper order the domain name will be locked, preventing changes to the DNS, and the allegedly offending registrant will be notified of the complaint. The registrant then has 14 calendar days to respond to the complaint before the complaint proceeds to default.\n\nAfter the complaint has been filed and either a response has been received or the complaint has entered default, a single examiner selected by the provider determines the outcome. The examiner should then examine the evidence and issue a verdict using a standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n\nThe examiner should find in favor of the complainant if; the registered domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a word mark, the complainant holds a valid and current national or regional registration of the mark in question, this mark is registered and validated in the Trademark Clearinghouse, the registrant has no legitimate right or interest to the domain name, and the domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith. All standards must be met for the examiner to find in favor of the complainant.\n\nIf the examiner determines that the domain name is non-infringing use, or a fair use, the complaint should be dismissed. However, the URS guidelines do not define \"fair use\", nor do they indicate which specific jurisdiction's definition of \"fair use\" should be used.\n\nIn October 2014 the domain names radisson.club and radissonblu.club were suspended using the URS. Saravanan Dhandapani, acting as the first examiner for the National Arbitration Forum (NAF) and the Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (ADNDRC), determined these two domain names infringed on the trademark of Radisson hotels.\n\nAs of October 2014 registering a single trademark can cost between $95 and $150 for one year. Three year and five year registrations are also available at reduced cost, as are bulk discounts. In general registering a single mark for one year will always be the most expensive option, while registering multiple marks for longer periods will incur greater discount.\n\nRegistries pay a one time fee to register between $7,000 - $10,000.\n\nThe basic fee structure is intended for registering small numbers of marks. It is only available to actual trademark holders, and not trademark agents. No bulk discounts are available, but discounts are given for registering marks for longer periods.\n\n\nThe advanced fee structure is intended for registering large numbers of marks. It is available for trademark holders and agents, and requires the establishment of a prepayment account. Discounts are available when buying in bulk and when purchasing for longer periods.\n\nThe advanced fee structure uses a Loyalty program to encourage more trademark registrations. Registrants using it gain points for each registration. As more points are earned successive levels are reached, which decrease the cost of the next batch of registrations. In short, the more registrations a registrant makes, and the longer their duration, the cheaper they get.\n\nICANN has subcontracted out most of the functionality of the Trademark Clearinghouse to IBM and Deloitte. IBM handles the technical implementation, administration and support of the trademark database. Deloitte is responsible for authentication and validation of trademarks.\n\nOn March 25, 2013, the Trademark Clearinghouse claimed it had \"delivered over 500,000 Trademark Claims notices and prevented over 475,000 trademarked names from being registered.\"\n\nUptake on new gTLDs has been brisk, with 426 new gTLDs introduced to the Internet as of October 17, 2014.\n\n"}
