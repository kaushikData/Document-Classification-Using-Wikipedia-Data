{"id": "35870844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35870844", "title": "Administrative Behavior", "text": "Administrative Behavior\n\nAdministrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization is a book written by Herbert A. Simon (1916–2001). It asserts that \"decision-making is the heart of administration, and that the vocabulary of administrative theory must be derived from the logic and psychology of human choice\", and it attempts to describe administrative organizations \"in a way that will provide the basis for scientific analysis\". The first edition was published in 1947; the second, in 1957; the third, in 1976; and the fourth, in 1997. As summarized in a 2001 obituary of Simon, the book \"reject[ed] the notion of an omniscient 'economic man' capable of making decisions that bring the greatest benefit possible and substitut[ed] instead the idea of 'administrative man' who 'satisfices—looks for a course of action that is satisfactory'\". \"Administrative Behavior\" laid the foundation for the economic movement known as the Carnegie School.\n\nThe book crosses social science disciplines such as political science and economics. Simon returned to some of the ideas in the book in his later works, such as \"The Sciences of the Artificial\" (1969). The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited the book as \"epoch-making\" in awarding the 1978 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences to Simon. A 1990 article in \"Public Administration Review\" named it the \"public administration book of the half century\" (1940-1990). It was voted the fifth most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management.\n\nThe book is based on Simon's doctoral thesis in political science at the University of Chicago, which he began planning in 1937. At the time, the chair of the political science department was Charles Edward Merriam.\n\nBeginning in 1936, Simon worked as a half-time research assistant and then as a full-time staff member at the International City Managers Association (ICMA). Among other activities at ICMA, he learned about administration and about scientific collaboration from director Clarence Ridley, and published his first book with Ridley in 1938. Although Simon cites Ridley as a major influence on his thinking, Simon did not actually work on his thesis while at ICMA.\n\nSimon took a position at the Bureau of Public Administration at the University of California, Berkeley between 1939 and 1942. It was at Berkeley that he completed his University of Chicago Ph.D. thesis, which was approved by a committee consisting of Leonard D. White, C. Herman Pritchett, Clarence Ridley, and Charner Marquis Perry. Simon received his doctorate in 1942.\n\nIn writing his thesis and book, Simon was influenced by \"The Functions of the Executive\" (1938) by Chester I. Barnard. In his 1991 autobiography, Simon wrote that he found Barnard's book \"wholly superior to the other administrative literature of the day and fully compatible with my preference for looking at management in decision-making terms\". The book, which Simon read \"with painstaking care\", motivated Simon to reflect upon his experiences and to focus on administrative decision making. In a 1988 interview, Simon was quoted as follows:\nOf course I built squarely on Barnard, and have always felt deeply indebted to him; science is a cumulative endeavor...In the book itself there are fourteen references to Barnard...the notions of the contribution-inducement equilibrium, authority, and zone of acceptance were all derived from Barnard...What I would now regard as the principal novelties in \"Administative\" [sic] \"Behavior\" are the development of the concept of organizational identification...the description of the decision process in terms of the processing of decision premises, and the bounded rationality notions...Most of the rest is highly \"Barnardian\", and certainly even those \"novel\" ideas are in no way inconsistent with Barnard's view of organizations.\nMitchell and Scott have noted similarities in Barnard's and Simon's concepts of authority, organizational equilibrium, and decision making. For example, Barnard's \"zone of indifference\" (a subordinate's unquestioned acceptance of authority) became Simon's \"zone of acceptance\". In addition, Mitchell and Scott concluded that both Simon and Barnard believed that large organizations control individuals' behavior and manipulate their opinions.\n\nPhilosophers who influenced Simon include William James, John Dewey, A. J. Ayer, and Rudolf Carnap. The ideas of behavioral psychologist Edward C. Tolman and sociologist Talcott Parsons also contributed to Simon's work. Simon characterized his own philosophical approach as logical positivism.\n\nIn 1945, when Simon was at the Illinois Institute of Technology, he sent mimeographed copies of a preliminary version of the book (which was similar to his thesis) to about 200 people he thought might be interested in his work. One of the recipients of the preliminary version was Barnard. Although Simon did not know Barnard personally, Barnard sent a total of 25 pages of detailed comments to Simon, which resulted in a thorough revision of the book. Simon then asked Barnard to write the book's foreword.\n\nThe first edition had 16 pages of front matter (e.g., a Foreword by Chester Barnard, a Preface, and Acknowledgements), as well as 259 pages of body matter (i.e., Chapters I-XI) and back matter (Appendix and Index).\n\nThe published first edition was different from the preliminary version in many ways, including:\n\nIn the Foreword, Barnard states that Simon's conclusions are \"consonant with [his] experience\" as an executive, and expresses hope that \"ultimately it may be possible to state principles of general organization\". In the Acknowledgements, Simon thanked Barnard for \"The Functions of the Executive\", for \"the extremely careful critical review he gave the preliminary version of this book\", and for his Foreword.\n\nThe second edition featured a new Introduction, causing the book to contain 48 pages of front matter and 259 pages of body and back matter. The Introduction summarized the book's structure, suggested how practitioners might apply the book's lessons, discussed the concepts of rational behavior and satisficing, commented on specific chapters in the book, and provided recent references.\n\nThe third edition, which had 50 pages of front matter and 364 pages of body and back matter, placed the original Chapters I-XI and Appendix into a Part I. Its \"Part II\" consisted of six new chapters (XII through XVII) based on articles that Simon had written:\n\nFor the fourth edition, with 15 pages of front matter and 368 pages of body and back matter, the last word in the subtitle was changed from \"Organization\" to \"Organizations\". The fourth edition lacked Barnard's foreword which had been present in the first through third editions. Instead of the third edition's lengthy Introduction and Part II, in the fourth edition the Introduction was briefer and Simon's commentaries followed each chapter of the original text.\n\nThe text and pagination of the 253 pages of Chapters I-XI and of the Appendix (\"What Is an Administrative Science?\") were the same in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions. Although the text of Chapters I-XI and the Appendix was the same in the 4th edition, the pagination was different.\n\nThis chapter was based on a 1944 article with the same name in \"Public Administration Review\". Simon distinguishes between \"value judgments\" (which \"lead toward the selection of final goals\") and \"factual judgments\" (which \"involve the implementation of such goals\"), a topic which he explores more fully in Chapter III. The relationship of the individual and the group in decision-making is explored; for example, influences upon individuals include authority, organizational loyalty, efficiency, advice and information, and training.\n\nBased on a 1946 article in \"Public Administration Review\" entitled \"The Proverbs of Administration\", Chapter II is notable for the following passage near its beginning:\nIt is a fatal defect of the current principles of administration that, like proverbs, they occur in pairs. For almost every principle one can find an equally plausible and acceptable contradictory principle. Although the two principles of the pair will lead to exactly opposite organizational recommendations, there is nothing in the theory to indicate which is the proper one to apply. To substantiate this criticism, it is necessary to examine briefly some of the leading principles.\nThese principles were found in the 1937 book \"Papers on the Science of Administration\" edited by Luther Gulick and Lyndall Urwick. After pointing out the shortcomings in the four principles, such as ambiguities and lack of empirical evidence, Simon states that \"over-all efficiency must be the guiding criterion\" in administrative organizations and that scientific methods must be applied to determine how to improve that efficiency.\n\nChapter III \"clarifies foundational aspects of the logic of choice.\" The first section of the chapter provides details for the explanation in Chapter I of \"facts\" versus \"values\". The chapter's second section on \"Policy and Administration\" discusses how the legislative and executive branches of government apply facts and values.\n\nAfter considering how the ideas of means and ends relate to decision-making, Simon distinguishes among \"objectively\", \"subjectively\", \"consciously\", \"deliberately\", \"organizationally\", and \"personally\" rational decisions.\n\nIn the first part of this chapter, \"The Limits of Rationality\", Simon wrote:\nActual behavior falls short, in at least three ways, of objective rationality…:\n\nThe remainder of the chapter concerns \"Purposive Behavior in the Individual\" and \"The Integration of Behavior\".\n\nAs summarized by Simon in the 4th edition's \"Commentary on Chapter VI\", the central idea of this chapter is that \"the survival and success of organizations depend on their providing sufficient incentives to their members to secure the contributions that are needed to carry out the organizations' tasks\".\n\nChapters VII-X deal with four ways in which an organization can influence an individual's decisions. In Chapter VII, Simon discusses the nature of authority and how it is used in organizations: for enforcing responsibility, for obtaining decision-making expertise, and for coordinating activity. Four methods are described for avoiding conflicts in authority when a subordinate has multiple superiors.\n\nSimon defines communication as \"any process whereby decisional premises are transmitted from one member of an organization to another\". Communication can be formal or informal, may need to be archived to provide \"memory\" for an organization, and is sometimes accomplished through training. The 4th edition's \"Commentary on Chapter VIII\" discusses computerized communications which were unavailable in 1947.\n\nThis chapter expands upon a concept that had been mentioned briefly in preceding chapters. In a for-profit organization, the \"criterion of efficiency\" states than an individual will select an alternative that will maximize income and minimize cost so as to \"yield the greatest net (money) return to the organization\". More generally (i.e., to include nonprofit organizations) the criterion causes \"\"that choice of alternatives which produces the largest result for the given application of resources\".\" In the remainder of the chapter, Simon counters criticisms of the efficiency criterion and outlines methods by which efficiency can be attained (e.g., by \"functionalization\" and by the public budgeting process).\n\nFollowing a concept of Harold Lasswell, Simon asserts that \"a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group.\" Such organizational identification can be associated with decisions that are not optimal in terms of an organization's efficiency or adequacy (\"the degree to which its goals have been reached\").\n\nSimon describes the organizational decision-making process and writes:\nThe need for an administrative theory resides in the fact that there \"are\" practical limits to human rationality, and that these limits are not static, but depend upon the organizational environment in which the individual's decision takes place. The task of administration is so to design this environment that the individual will approach as close as practicable to rationality (judged in terms of the organization's goals) in his decisions.\nIn the final part of the book common to all editions, Simon discusses the \"theoretical\" (descriptive) aspects and \"practical\" aspects (i.e., leading toward the improved attainment of objectives) of the science of administration.\n\n\nSimon felt that the reviews of the first edition \"were generally kind, but the reviewers were not exhilerated [sic]\", and that the book \"created no sensation\" at first. Nevertheless, it became notable for the following innovations:\n\"The central concern of administrative theory is with the boundary between the rational and the nonrational aspects of human social behavior\". Administrative theory is peculiarly the theory of intended and bounded rationality – of the behavior of human beings who \"satisfice\" because they have not the wits to \"maximize\".\n\nSimon would return to the concepts from \"Administrative Behavior\" in later books that he co-authored, including \"Public Administration\" (with Donald W. Smithburg and Victor A. Thompson, 1950); \"Organizations\" (with James G. March, 1958); and \"The Sciences of the Artificial\" (1969). Among books written by other authors, \"Administrative Behavior\" influenced:\n\nIn 1978, Sune Carlson said in a speech at the ceremony awarding Simon a Nobel Prize in Economics:\n…the study of the structure and the decision-making of the firm became an important task in economic science. … In his epoch-making book \"Administrative Behavior\", which first appeared in 1947 and which has been translated into nearly a dozen languages, as well as in a number of subsequent works, Simon describes the company as an adaptive system of physical, personal and social components, which are held together by a network of intercommunications and by the willingness of its members to co-operate and to work towards common goals. …\n\nNevertheless, it was reported that economists Albert Ando and William Baumol had \"made little reference to \"Administrative Behavior\"\" in arguing to the Nobel Prize Committee that Simon should win.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1988, the book was translated into 12 languages: Chinese, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. A set of 12 papers about the book appeared in \"Public Administration Quarterly\" in 1988-1989 for the book's 40th anniversary.\n\nIn 1990, Sherwood reported in \"Public Administration Review\" that 19 of 20 members of an informal advisory panel voted \"Administrative Behavior\" one of the \"five or six most influential\" books in academic public administration published between 1940 and 1990, making it the \"public administration book of the half century.\" It was the \"overwhelming leader\" among the books nominated, receiving \"twice as many nominations as any other book.\" Despite over 150,000 copies of the book having been sold in English, in a small survey of recent graduates from a Master of Public Administration program, Sherwood found widespread belief in the administrative proverbs that Simon attempted to discredit in Chapter II.\n\nThe fourth edition of the book was released in 1997; its Introduction noted the book's \"fiftieth birthday.\" The book was cited in obituaries of Simon in 2001.\n\nBy 2009, the book had received 7,746 citations on Google Scholar. Of the articles that cited the book, the articles that were most-cited concerned organizational learning, the economic sociology, transaction cost economics, and organizational decision making. \"Administrative Behavior\" appeared in at least three lists of \"best\" or \"most influential\" management and business books between 2001 and 2011. As of 2012, the fourth edition of the book is still in print.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5247146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5247146", "title": "Adult Film Association of America", "text": "Adult Film Association of America\n\nThe Adult Film Association of America (AFAA) was the first American association of pornographic film producers. It fought against censorship laws, attempted to defend the industry against prosecution for obscenity, and held an annual adult film awards ceremony. Founded in 1969, it continued separate operation until 1992 when it merged with Free Speech Legal Defense Fund. The organization was also host to the Erotic Film Awards which were held from 1977 until 1986.\n\nIt was founded in 1969 in Kansas City, with Sam Chernoff of Astro-Jemco Film Co. as the first president. Other notable presidents included film producer David F. Friedman, elected the third president in 1971, and re-elected four times before becoming Chairman of the Board, and erotic actress and magazine publisher Gloria Leonard, who became president in 1986.\n\nIt held adult film awards ceremonies for 10 years during the Golden Age of Porn. The first awards ceremony was held July 14, 1977, at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles while religious protesters picketed outside, as they would several years thereafter. \"These feverish protesters are such a familiar part of the ritual, they really should be listed in the program,\" sex news magazine \"Cheri\" stated after the 1983 awards.\n\nWith the advent of pornography on video, in early 1986 the AFAA renamed itself Adult Film and Video Association of America (AFVAA) and added a new award category, best adult video. The 10th annual awards, held at the Sheraton Premiere Hotel in Los Angeles on June 29, 1986, were the last.\n\nThe association changed its name again in 1987 to the Adult Video Association (AVA). No awards were given for 1987. Instead, in mid-1988 they were replaced by an annual Night of the Stars dinner-dance and legal fundraiser, the fifth of which it held in June 1992 with more than 500 people in attendance, the association's biggest show ever. Lifetime Achievement Awards were presented at the Night of the Stars, however, film awards were discontinued.\n\nBy February 1992, the tables were turned – association members \"picketed the Public Forum on Pornography sponsored by religious groups who hope to institute morality codes back into all movies made.\"\n\nIn October 1992, Video Vixens Trading Cards for collectors were released with part of the profits going to the AVA. That same month, the AVA and Free Speech Legal Defense Fund, which had been organized in 1991, unified to create a new umbrella organization, the Free Speech Coalition (FSC). Its role as the trade association of the adult entertainment industry was taken over by the FSC, which acknowledges the AFAA as its first ancestor.\n\nPornographic actress Marilyn Chambers presented the very first award for best erotic motion picture to the L. Sultana production of \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\", while runner-up was \"Count the Ways\", produced by Virginia Ann Perry. Jennifer Welles and Jamie Gillis were the first winners in the best actress and best actor categories. Pornographic actor John Holmes told the crowd at the first year's awards, \"In the not-too-far distant future we will proudly say that we were pioneers.\"\n\nRetroactive awards of merit were also given to five movies considered best from 1955 to 1975: \"Tonight for Sure\", \"Not Tonight, Henry!\" \"Trader Hornee\" and \"Sometime Sweet Susan\". \"Deep Throat\" was also honored as one of the top-grossing of all movies, including mainstream films, of 1972. Board chairman Friedman said the AFAA was \"much too busy fighting legal battles\" in the early days to hold awards ceremonies, so these special awards were intended to make up for not having presented them in the past.\n\nFor a time the most notable erotic film awards were those of the AFAA, considered to be \"the closest thing the porn world's got to filmdom's Oscar derby.\" Many stars would arrive in chauffeur-driven limousines while some would vie for attention by arriving in a four-horse carriage, a Roman chariot, a horse or even an elephant. The third annual awards \"drew a festive crowd of some 600 porn-people plus several hundred hard-core fans to the Hollywood Palladium.\" Subsequent awards shows even attracted celebrities such as \"The Godfather\" director Francis Ford Coppola, singer Stephen Bishop and gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson to be part of the audience and comedian Jackie Gayle and singer Jaye P. Morgan of \"The Gong Show\" to be part of evening's entertainment. The fifth and eighth awards ceremonies were videotaped and offered to cable and subscription television and for sale on VHS cassettes while the seventh was taped for an August 1983 broadcast on Playboy TV. Other awards during the porno chic era included \"Adam Film World's\" X-Caliber awards, first given out in 1975 and based on votes of fans, \"Hustler\" magazine's Erotic Movie Awards, first presented in 1977 and the Critics Adult Film Awards, bestowed by a New York-based group of East Coast adult sex film critics from 1981 to 1987.\n\nBy the third awards ceremony in 1980, although the concept was seen as positive, adult entertainment magazine \"Genesis\" reported they were \"beginning to generate as much controversy as the regular Academy Awards, or more.\" While it seemed \"politicking\" gave the Best Film award to \"Legend of Lady Blue\" over heavy favorites \"Sex World\" and \"Take Off\", the \"most glaring lack of any validity\" was shown by giving the best actor award to Aldo Ray. \"The Erotica Awards are supposed to be presented to sex-film performers who both 'act' well and 'perform' well. In \"Sweet Savage\", not only did Aldo Ray not 'act' particularly well—his part was simply gratuitous...he never even performed at all. The fact is he never even took his clothes off, nor did he show up to receive his award.\" Aside from that, \"Sweet Savage\" was released \"well into 1979\" and the films nominated were supposed to have been released in 1978, leaving the impression the AFAA gave him the award to \"capitalize on his name and to obtain more media coverage.\" \"Adam Film World Guide\", however, reported the following year's awards, which were presented in July 1981, \"covered films released from mid-1980 to the middle of '81\", which could have meant \"Sweet Savage\" was eligible for awards in 1979 if the same time frame was considered. Meanwhile, \"Adam Film World\" noted Ray's award \"was not surprising considering that one of the announced functions of the aFAA and its annual awards is to upgrade the image of the adult film industry in the public eye.\"\n\nOriginally the Erotica Awards were determined by vote of the \"association's membership of more than 700 producers, distributors and theater operators.\" However, in later years the AFAA ceremony was increasingly accused of bias, with a \"belief among some that the West Coast producers were controlling what films received the awards\" after \"Amanda By Night\" was passed over for best film at the 1981 awards. Starting with the awards presented in 1982, the AFAA decided to appoint an independent jury of three persons not associated with the adult film industry to make the final choices from the five finalists in each category. Jurors subsequently included an assortment of men and women such as a sexologist, author Robert Rimmer and journalists such as Brendan Gill of \"The New Yorker\" and other publications including \"Daily Variety\", \"Playboy\", \"USA Today\" and the \"Los Angeles Herald Examiner\".\n\nHowever, criticism continued, especially for the best erotic scene victory of \"Virginia\" in 1984, which led to the founding of the X-Rated Critics Organization and its Heart-On Awards. The role of adult film awards has been mostly supplanted by the AVN Awards, which also launched in 1984.\n\nThe AFAA had a credo that \"recognized the responsibilities of adult filmmakers to the general public\":\n1. That films of adult subject matter will be produced for and exhibited to adult audiences and that persons not of legal age will not be admitted.\n2. That the definition of an \"adult\" is that designation set by the constituted authorities of the community but in no event any persons under the age of 18 years.\n3. That we will produce and exhibit only films that are in conformity with the Free Speech Provisions of the Constitution of the United States of America.\n4. That we will respect the privacy of the general public in our advertising and public displays.\n5. That we in \"no manner\" will condone, produce or exhibit child pornography in any form.\n\nThe AFAA awards were called the Erotic Film Awards and the trophy, known as the Erotica Award, was a golden statuette \"in the form of a shapely nude holding high a rampant spear in an obvious attitude of erotic excitement.\" Winners are shown below in the year the awards were presented:\n\nAfter the Erotic Film Awards were discontinued, the association resumed presenting Lifetime Achievement Awards at its annual \"Night of the Stars\" fundraising event, starting in mid-1988. When the association merged into the Free Speech Coalition in late 1992, the new coalition took over the tradition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"Adam Film World\" recorded the winner of this category in 1979 as having been a tie between Roger Caine and John Seeman. \"Cinema-X\" magazine recorded Roger Caine as the sole winner.\n\n"}

She was the daughter of the banker and diplomat Andrew W. Mellon and Nora Mary (née McMullen) Mellon (1879–1937). Her parents divorced in 1912 and from 1921 to 1932, Ailsa served as her father's official hostess during his tenure as United States Secretary of the Treasury, and again when he was U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1932–1933. Her only sibling was brother Paul Mellon (1907–1999), who was also a philanthropist and was known as a prominent owner/breeder of thoroughbred racehorses.\n\nAilsa attended Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut and spent her summers as a teenager in Europe.\n\nBruce established the Avalon Foundation in 1940, which made grants to colleges and universities, medical schools and hospitals, youth programs and community services, churches, environmental projects, and an array of cultural and arts organizations. In 1947, the Avalon Foundation was instrumental in the establishment of the Hampton National Historic Site in Maryland.\n\nIn 1957, when \"Fortune\" prepared its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that Ailsa Mellon Bruce, her brother, Paul, and her cousins, Sarah Mellon and Richard King Mellon, were all among the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes of between 400 and 700 million dollars each. In 1968, Ailsa and Paul donated $20 million to build an annex to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt her death in 1969, Ailsa Bruce bequeathed 153 paintings, primarily by 19th-century French artists, to the National Gallery of Art, as well as establishing a fund for future acquisitions. Among the many works acquired by the Gallery through the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund was the portrait of \"Ginevra de' Benci\", the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the United States. In 1969, the assets of Paul Mellon’s Old Dominion Foundation were merged into his sister's Avalon Foundation, which was renamed the Andrew W.

Their engagement, marriage (which was attended by President and Mrs. Coolidge) and honeymoon were followed closely by the news media. In 1933, after seven years of marriage, Ailsa gave birth to her only child; \n\n\nShe obtained a divorce from her husband in Palm Beach, Florida in April 1945 on the grounds of \"desertion and mental cruelty\", receiving sole custody of their 11 year old daughter. Following their divorce, her ex-husband would later become the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1961 to 1969, the same position her father held.\n\nShe died on August 25, 1969 at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City.

The High Court's judgment was received as a significant precedent in the law of derivative governmental immunity in Australia.\n\nBaxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian subsidiary of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia. Because of the cost of importing sterile IV fluids and the absence of a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids (PD fluids).\n\nA number of state governments issued requests for tender for the supply of sterile fluids and PD fluids. Baxter responded to the requests with tenders that put forward two alternative pricing options: either a state could purchase sterile fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate, or the state could buy each product separately but at a higher rate.\n\nSection 46 of the TPA prohibited corporations from misusing market power. Section 47 prohibited exclusive dealing. The critical provision to the case was Section 2B of the TPA. Section 2B provided that Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA:\n\n... bind the Crown in right of each of the States, of the Northern Territory and of the Australian Capital Territory, so far as the Crown carries on a business, either directly or by an authority of the State or Territory ...\n\nSection 2B thus provided an immunity from state and territory governments from Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA insofar as the governments were not carrying on a business.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Australian government authority responsible for regulating the TPA, commenced an action in the Federal Court of Australia seeking declarations that Baxter's bundling pricing structure in its tenders had contravened Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA. The ACCC sought the imposition of injunctions and pecuniary penalties by the court.\n\nDerivative governmental immunity refers to the extension of a government's immunity from a statute to a non-government party on the basis the government would be affected if the statute was to apply to the other party.\n\nPrior to \"Baxter\", the leading case on derivative governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in \"Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd\". In \"Bradken\", the High Court upheld a claim for derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways. The majority's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to the contracts and arrangements.\n\n\"Bradken\"'s application of the principle of derivative governmental immunity had been subject to criticism. Robertson Wright SC, a Senior Counsel specialising in competition and trade practices law, argued there are \"a number of difficulties\" with the judgment, including the \"unsatisfactory nature\" of the authorities it relied on. The High Court's judgment in \"Baxter\" would mark a retreat from \"Bradken\".\n\nThe ACCC conceded that the state governments were not carrying on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity. On 16 May 2005, The Federal Court of Australia (Allsop J presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance. While the court held that Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section 2B extended to Baxter Healthcare. Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices Mansfield, Dowsett and Gyles presiding). The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of \"Bradken\".\n\nThe ACCC was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court against the judgment of the full bench of the Federal Court. The appeal was heard on 16 May 2007. The Australian Government Solicitor acted for the ACCC, with Lindsay Foster as Senior Counsel; Blake Dawson and David Yates SC represented Baxter. In addition to Baxter, the states of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales were respondents to the appeal. The High Court decided on 29 August 2007, by a 6–1 majority, to allow the ACCC's appeal and remit the matter back to the full bench of Federal Court for reconsideration. The majority held that Baxter was not covered by derivative governmental immunity in its dealings with the state governments.\n\nFive judges (Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan) joined in the leading majority judgment allowing the ACCC's appeal. The joint judgment reasoned that Parliament could not have intended for corporations that do business with the government to be exempt from the restrictive trade practices provisions in Part IV of the TPA in respect of that business. Emphasising the overall purpose of the TPA, the judges reasoned that the purpose would not be fulfilled if Baxter could claim derivative immunity. In response to the concern that one party to a transaction (the government) would be immune from the TPA while the other party would be bound by it, the joint judgment reasoned there was \"nothing unusual\" about such an outcome.\n\nThe joint judgment did not rule out derivative governmental immunity in all cases. In determining the scope of whether governmental immunity from a statutory provision extends to a party dealing with the government, the judgment adopted the following position of Justice Kitto, then dissenting, in the 1955 High Court case of \"Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways (NSW)\":\n\nThe object in view is to ascertain whether the Crown has such an interest in that which would be interfered with if the provision in question were held to bind the corporation that the interference would be, for a legal reason, an interference with some right, interest, power, authority, privilege, immunity or purpose belonging or appertaining to the Crown.\n\n\"Wynyard Investments\" was a case about governmental immunity generally (not derivative governmental immunity specifically), but Justice Kitto's dissenting judgment extended to derivative governmental immunity.\n\nHaving examined the characteristics of the TPA as a law to promote competitive behaviour, the joint judgment held that the extension of derivative governmental immunity from the TPA to a trading corporation would be a \"remarkable\" conclusion and \"far beyond what is necessary to protect the legal rights of governments, or to prevent a divesting of proprietary, contractual or other legal rights and interests.\"\n\nJustice Kirby's judgment agreed with the outcome of the joint judgment, for different reasons. Kirby criticised the concept of governmental immunity itself, stating that \"persisting with [governmental immunity] into the twenty-first century is unacceptable.\"\n\nJustice Callinan dissented from the majority, holding that derivative governmental immunity extended to Baxter. Callinan followed \"Bradken\", concluding that it remained authoritative.\n\nRobertson Wright, writing after the judgment was handed down, claimed that \"Baxter\" represented a change to the law, drawing the following conclusions from the judgment:\n\nThe judgment was reported in the press as a significant legal victory for the ACCC. The judgment was also received as an \"historic decision\" setting a precedent for government procurement, on the basis that businesses might no longer be able to rely on immunity from the TPA when contracting with governments.\n\nNicholas Seddon, a lawyer and academic specialising in commercial and government law, claimed the High Court's judgment leaves \"many uncertainties\", particularly regarding whether derivative governmental immunity will extend to private sector providers carrying out governmental functions that have been contracted to them (as opposed to merely providing goods or services to the government). Robertson Wright echoed these concerns, arguing the joint judgment did not \"set out in as helpful detail\" as it might the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether governmental immunity will derive to a party dealing with the government. Seddon also criticised the outcome of the case itself, arguing it is \"difficult to see how derivative immunity does not inevitably flow\" from the governmental immunity from the TPA. He suggested that the application of the TPA to a party that deals with a government compromises the intention of Parliament that State and Territory governments should be immune from the TPA.\n\nThe ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, upon the remittal of the case to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA. That judgment ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It was the first time in over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section 46. The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA, but left it to the ACCC to seek pecuniary penalties. Baxter was refused special leave to appeal to the High Court against the full bench's judgment.\n\n"}
{"id": "57382752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57382752", "title": "Australian dividend imputation system", "text": "Australian dividend imputation system\n\nThe Australian dividend imputation system is a corporate tax system in which some or all of the tax paid by a company may be attributed, or imputed, to the shareholders by way of a tax credit to reduce the income tax payable on a distribution. In comparison to the classical system, dividend imputation reduces or eliminates the tax disadvantages of distributing dividends to shareholders by only requiring them to pay the difference between the corporate rate and their marginal rate.\n\nThe objective of the dividend imputation system is to eliminate double taxation of company profits, once at the corporate level and again on distribution as dividend to shareholders. More specifically, it is intended to create a \"level playing field\" by taxing the same activity in the same way, irrespective of the business structure being used, namely a company or trust, sole trader or partnership. Under the previous system, the company and shareholders had an incentive for the taxed income of the company to be retained by the company. \n\nBefore 1987, an Australian company would pay company tax on its profits at a flat rate of 49%; and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder. The company and shareholders had an incentive for the taxed income of the company to be retained by the company. Paying a dividend gave raise to double taxation, once by the company at the corporate rate and then on dividend income in the hands of the company’s shareholders. \n\nDividend imputation was introduced in Australia in 1987 to stop this effect and create a \"level playing field\". The company tax rate was reduced to 39% in 1988 and 33% in 1993, and increased again in 1995 to 36%, to be reduced to 34% in 2000 and 30% in 2001. \n\nDividend imputation was introduced in 1987, one of a number of tax reforms by the Hawke–Keating Labor Government. Prior to that a company would pay company tax on its profits and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder, i.e. a part owner of the company, a form of double taxation.\n\nIn 1997, the eligibility rules (below) were introduced by the Howard–Costello Liberal Government, with a $2,000 small shareholder exemption. In 1999 that exemption was raised to the present $5,000. In 2000, franking credits became fully refundable, not just reducing tax liability to zero. In 2002, preferential dividend streaming was banned. In 2003, New Zealand companies could elect to join the system for Australian tax they paid.\n\nFrom 2015/16, designated \"small business entities\" with an aggregated annual turnover threshold of less than $2 million were eligible for a lower tax rate of 28.5%. Since 1 July 2016, small business entities with aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million have had a reduced company tax rate of 27.5%. Additionally, the Australian Government announced that from 2017/18, corporate entities eligible for the lower tax rate will be known as \"base rate entities\". The small business definition will remain at $10 million from 2017–18 onwards, however the base rate entity threshold (the aggregated annual turnover threshold under which entities will be eligible to pay a lower tax rate) will continue to rise.\n\nThe present operation of the system is as follows. The actual law is complex, the core is in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and other elements are in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.\n\nAustralian companies that have paid Australian company tax can declare how much of the tax it paid is to be imputed or associated with any dividend it pays. Dividends with the maximum imputed tax amount are called franked dividends, while any other dividends are unfranked. Australian-resident shareholders who receive franked dividends from Australian companies would declare both the dividends and the associated imputation credits (as well as the unfranked dividends) on their tax returns, but are entitled to claim back a tax credit (called a franking credit) on those imputation credits.\n\nInitially, in 1987, excess franking credits over the tax liability were lost, but since 2000, such excess credits have been refundable.\n\nNon-resident shareholders are not entitled to claim a tax credit or refund of imputation credits. Unfranked dividends received by non-residents are subject to a withholding tax, which does not apply to franked dividends.\n\nSay, a company makes a profit of $100 and pays company tax of $30 (at 2006 rates) and records the $30 in the franking account. The $30 is paid to the tax office. The company now has $70 left to pay a dividend, either in the same year or later years. When it does so, it may attach a franking credit from its franking account, in proportion to the tax rate. So if it pays a $70 dividend it could attach $30 of franking credits. When the dividend is paid, the franking account is debited by $30.\n\nAn eligible shareholder receiving a franked dividend declares the cash amount plus the franking credit as income, and is credited with the franking credit against their final tax bill. The effect is as if the tax office reversed the company tax by giving back the $30 to the shareholder and had them treat the original $100 of profit as income, in the shareholder's hands, like the company was merely a conduit.\n\nThus company profits going to eligible shareholders are taxed just once. Profits are either retained by the company and taxed there at the corporate rate, or paid out later as dividends and instead they're taxed at the shareholder's rate.\n\nDividends may still be paid by a company when it has no franking credits (perhaps because it has been making tax losses), this is called an \"unfranked dividend\". Or it may pay a franked portion and an unfranked portion, known as \"partly franked\". An unfranked dividend (or the unfranked portion) is ordinary income in the hands of the shareholder.\n\nCompanies can determine the proportion of the dividends they pay will have franking credits attach. This can range from the dividend being fully franked to it being entirely unfranked. A franking credit is a nominal unit of tax paid by companies using dividend imputation. \n\nShareholders who are residents of Australia for tax purposes include in their assessable income the grossed-up dividend amount (being the total of the dividend payable plus the associated franking credits). The income tax payable by the shareholders is calculated, and the franking credits are applied to offset the tax payable. In Australia and New Zealand the end result is the elimination of double taxation of company profits.\n\nFor a company that pays tax on all its income in Australia, the franking proportion is usually 100% (or 1). However, some companies (particularly those paying tax outside of Australia) have a lower franking proportion. \n\nFranking Credits = (Dividend Amount / (1 − Company Tax Rate)) − Dividend Amount\n\nExample - a company pays a 30% company tax rate and distributes a $7.00 dividend to shareholders:\n\nFranking Credits = ($7.00 / (1 − 0.3)) − $7.00\n\n<nowiki>= ($7.00 / (0.7)) − $7.00</nowiki>\n\n<nowiki>= $10.00 − $7.00</nowiki>\n\n<nowiki>= $3.00</nowiki>\n\nFranking Credits = $3.00\n\nThe shareholder is credited $3.00.\n\nFranking Credits from Partial Franking = ((Dividend Amount / (1 − Company Tax Rate)) − Dividend Amount) × Franking Proportion\n\nExample - a company pays a 30% company tax rate but is only eligible for 50% franking and distributed a $7.00 dividend to shareholders:\n\nFranking Credits from Partial Franking = (($7.00 / (1 − 0.3)) − $7.00) × 0.5\n\n<nowiki>= (($7.00 / (0.7)) − $7.00) × 0.5</nowiki>\n\n<nowiki>= ($10.00 − $7.00) × 0.5</nowiki>\n\n<nowiki>= $3.00 × 0.5</nowiki>\n\n<nowiki>= $1.50</nowiki>\n\nFranking Credits from Partial Franking = $1.50\n\nThe shareholder is credited $1.50.\n\nFranking credits on dividends received after 1 July 2000 are refundable tax credits. It is a form of tax prepayment, which can reduce a taxpayer's total tax liability, with any excess being refunded. For example, an individual with income below the tax-free threshold ($18,200 since 2011/12) will pay no tax at all and can get a refund of the franking credits in full, after a tax return is lodged.\n\nPrior to 1 July 2000 such excess franking credits were lost. For example, an individual at that time paying no tax would get nothing back, and would merely keep the cash part of the dividend received.\n\nA franking credit is income received by the shareholder, though it is not paid in cash. It is a credit towards tax that may be payable by the shareholder. Thus a franked dividend of $0.70 plus a $0.30 franking credit is equivalent to an unfranked dividend of $1.00, or to bank interest of $1.00, or any other ordinary income of that amount. (It is exactly equivalent because franking credits are fully refundable, as described above.)\n\nFranked dividends are often described as a \"tax effective\" form of income. The basis for this is that the cash $0.70 looks like it is taxed at a lower rate than other income. For example, for an individual on the top rate of 48.5% (for 2006) the calculation is $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is $1.00 on which $0.485 tax is payable, but less the $0.30 credit makes $0.185 net tax, which is just 26.4% of the original $0.70. Conversely, an individual on the 20% marginal tax rate actually gets a $0.10 rebate. In this latter case, the rebate looks very much like negative tax.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with the latter way of thinking about franked dividends, and it is frequently made to demonstrate how franking benefits the investor, but it can be argued a grossing-up like the former is better when comparing yields across different investment opportunities.\n\nThere are restrictions on who can claim franking credits. Those who cannot claim the credit simply declare as income the cash part of the dividend amount received, and ignore the franking credit on the tax return. The \"holding period rule\" has applied since 1 July 2000. Its objective is to prevent traders buying shares on the last cum-dividend date and selling them the following day ex-dividend. The typical result would be that the trader would receive the dividend, together with the franking credits, while incurring an equivalent capital loss and qualifying for the franking credit with only overnight risk in holding the shares. \n\nAn eligible shareholder is one who either:\n\n\n\nThus franking credits are not available to short-term traders, only to longer term holders, but with small holders exempted provided it's for their own benefit.\n\nThe small shareholder exemption is not a \"first $5000\", but rather once the $5000 threshold is passed the rule is inoperative and all the shares are under the holding period rule.\n\nFor the holding period rule, parcels of shares bought and sold at different times are reckoned on a \"first in, last out\" basis. Each sale is taken to be of the most recently purchased shares. This prevents a taxpayer buying just before a dividend, selling just after, and asserting it was older shares sold (to try to fulfill the holding period).\n\nThis \"first in, last out\" reckoning may be contrasted with capital gains tax. For capital gains the shareholder can nominate what parcel was sold from among those bought at different times.\n\nA dividend received by a company shareholder is income of the receiving company, but the dividend income is not grossed-up for the franking credit nor is the receiving company entitled to claim the franking credit as a tax credit. Instead, the franking credit is added directly to the receiving company's franking account, and can be paid out in the same way as franking credits generated by the receiving company.\n\nThis transfer of credits has made the previous \"intercorporate rebates\" allowances redundant. Those rebates had avoided double taxation on dividends paid from one company to another company. Those rebates were part of the original 1936 Taxation Act (section 46), meaning that the principle of eliminating double taxation has been present to some degree in Australian income tax law for a very long time.\n\nThe company tax rate has changed a few times since the introduction of dividend imputation. In each case transitional rules have been made to maintain the principle of reversing the original tax paid, even if the tax rate has changed. This has been either by separate franking accounts for separate rates (e.g. class A 39%, class B 33%), or making an adjusting recalculation of the credits (e.g. into class C 30%).\n\nNew Zealand companies can apply to join the Australian dividend imputation system (from 2003). Doing so allows them to attach Australian franking credits to their dividends, for Australian tax they have paid. Those credits can then be used by shareholders who are Australian taxpayers, the same as dividends from an Australian company.\n\nThere are certain anti-tax-avoidance rules to prevent New Zealand companies deliberately streaming Australian franking credits towards their Australian shareholders; credits must be distributed on a pro-rata basis.\n\nNote that it is only Australian franking credits which can be used by an Australian taxpayer. New Zealand imputation credits on dividends paid to an Australian shareholder cannot be used against that shareholder's Australian taxes.\n\nA company can determine the level of franking credits it will attach to its dividends, and they are not obliged to attach any franking credits. However, it costs the company nothing to attach the maximum amounts of credits it has available, which is the usual practice to benefit eligible shareholders. It is actually possible for a company to attach more franking credits than it has, but doing so attracts certain tax penalties.\n\nUntil 2002 it was permissible for companies to direct the flow of franking credits preferentially to one type of shareholder over another so that each could benefit the most as fits their tax circumstances. For example, franking credits are of no use to foreign shareholders, who cannot offset them against withholding tax, but Australian shareholders can claim them as a tax credit. This practice, known as \"dividend streaming\", became illegal in 2002, after which all dividends within a given time frame must be franked to a similar (but need not be identical) degree irrespective of shareholder location or which class of shares they hold.\n\nDivision 7A of the Tax Act applies where there is a loan, payment or the forgiveness of a loan to a shareholder or an associate of a shareholder of a private company. When such amounts are not repaid by the end of a financial year they may be treated as unfranked dividends. The total of all dividends a private company can be taken to pay under Division 7A is limited to its \"distributable surplus\" for that income year, which includes the retained earnings plus provisions made for accounting purposes.\n\nAn ‘associate’ is very broad and generally includes a trust under which a shareholder can benefit. This will mean that Division 7A can apply to loans to discretionary trusts and unit trusts in the family group, and sometimes to such trusts not in a family group.\n\nTo a large extent, dividend imputation makes company tax irrelevant. This is because every dollar that a company pays in company tax can be claimed by the shareholder as franking credit, with no net revenue flowing to the government. (There are exceptions which include profits retained by the company that are never paid as dividends, and payments to international investors.)\n\nWhen gross company tax is reported by Treasury, it is unclear whether the number generally includes the effect of the corresponding franking credits.\n\nOne effect is that this has reduced the effectiveness of tax incentives for corporations. If a corporation was given a tax break then its incomes thus released from taxation would not generate franking credits precisely because no tax was paid. In turn, this meant that the shareholders received fewer credits along with their dividends, meaning in turn that they had to pay more tax.\n\nThe net result is that each tax break a corporation itself got was countered by a matching increase in the tax burden of shareholders, leaving shareholders in exactly the same position had no tax break been received by the corporation. Thus, to the extent that corporate directors acted so as to increase shareholder wealth, tax incentives would not influence corporate behaviour.\n\nDividend imputation has been uncontroversial over most of its lifetime. Investors and their advisors recognise the benefits and are supportive.\n\nIn October 2006, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia released a report, \"Tax Cuts to Compete\", concluding that dividend imputation had proved an inefficient means of reducing Australia's cost of capital. The report, authored by prominent economist Dr Nicholas Gruen, argued that the elimination of imputation would allow the funding of a substantial corporate tax cut. This would attract foreign investment and thus increase economic growth, it said.\n\n\n"}

The Hub was intended to be a general, youth-oriented network with a \"diverse\" lineup, primarily featuring programming adapted from Hasbro franchises (such as \"Transformers\", its board games, \"My Little Pony\", \"Pound Puppies\" and \"Littlest Pet Shop\") along with other family-oriented programs such as sitcom reruns and films.\n\nOn September 25, 2014, following reports earlier in the year that Hub Network president Margaret Loesch would step down by the end of the year, Discovery acquired 10% of Hasbro's stake in the network, and replaced Loesch with Henry Schleiff, who leads sister networks such as Destination America and Investigation Discovery. On October 13, 2014, Hub Network was re-branded as Discovery Family to which Hasbro remains a minority partner and programs the network's daytime lineup with children's programs carried over from Hub Network, while its prime-time lineup was replaced with reruns of non-fiction programs from Discovery Channel's library, including science and nature programs.\n\nAs of February 2015, approximately 69,513,000 American households (59.7% of households with television) receive Discovery Family.\n\nDiscovery Communications launched Discovery Kids Channel on October 7, 1996, as part of a suite of four new digital cable channels that included Discovery Travel & Living, Discovery Civilization, and Science Channel. Upon its launch, the network primarily offered adventure, nature, and science-themed programs aimed towards a children's audience between ages 6 and 11. Marjorie Kaplan, the network's senior vice president, explained that the creation of Discovery Kids was influenced primarily by kids who were watching its parent network's programming together with their parents. From 1996 until 2000, Discovery Kids was carried by only a select few cable television providers. By late 2001, the channel was carried in at least 15 million homes. In September 2001, a Canadian version of Discovery Kids was launched in partnership with Corus Entertainment.\n\nIn December 2001, Discovery Kids announced a partnership with NBC, in which it would produce a new Saturday morning block for the network known as \"Discovery Kids on NBC\", beginning in September 2002. The block, which replaced a teen-oriented block consisting only of sitcoms, featured programming that met the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) educational programming guidelines, including new original series (such as the reality television series \"Endurance\"), existing Discovery Kids programming, along with children's spin-offs of programs from sister networks, such as Animal Planet and Discovery Channel.\n\nWith the launch of the new block, Discovery Kids also branched out into animated programming with the premieres of \"Kenny the Shark\" and \"Tutenstein\". In March 2006, Discovery declined to renew its contract with NBC for its Saturday morning block, citing a desire to focus exclusively on the Discovery Kids cable channel. Since the launch of the NBC block, Discovery Kids had grown its cable carriage to over 43 million homes. NBC would replace the Discovery Kids block with Qubo in September 2006.\n\nOn April 30, 2009, toy manufacturer and multimedia company Hasbro announced that it would be forming a joint venture with Discovery Communications to relaunch Discovery Kids as a new family-oriented television channel. Under the arrangement, Discovery would be in charge of handling advertising sales and distribution for the new channel while Hasbro would be involved in acquiring and producing programming. While the network planned to maintain educational series (including those carried over from Discovery Kids), plans called for new original programs based off Hasbro-owned franchises such as \"G.I. Joe\", \"My Little Pony\", \"Transformers\" and game shows adapted from its board game brands.\n\nIn January 2010, Discovery and Hasbro announced that the new network would be known as The Hub; two months later, the companies announced that The Hub would be launched on October 10, 2010. The network planned to continue targeting Discovery Kids' main demographic of children aged 2-14 (a market which staff felt was being abandoned by its competitors such as Nickelodeon and Disney Channel in favor of tweens) but also planned to feature a prime-time block with family-oriented programming. Veteran television executive and the network's president and chief executive officer Margaret Loesch stated that The Hub's goal was to be \"vibrant\" and \"diverse\" in its programming and that the channel would not purely be a marketing vehicle for Hasbro products. The network's original imaging was developed by Troika Design Group and built around an emblem nicknamed the \"hubble\" – which was designed to embody a \"catalyst of action and imagination\". The final logo design was the result of a number of drafts by Troika designers, some of which had incorporated typography similar to Hasbro's logo.\n\nTo promote the launch of The Hub, sneak previews of shows slated to air on the channel such as \"Cosmic Quantum Ray\", \"The Twisted Whiskers Show\" and \"Family Game Night\" aired on Science Channel, Animal Planet and TLC respectively. The Hub was finally launched on its launching date October 10, 2010, with \"The Twisted Whiskers Show\" being the first program to air followed by an episode of \"Dennis and Gnasher\" and \"Cosmic Quantum Ray\". The Hub's launch programming would include the game show \"Family Game Night\", animated television series \"Pound Puppies\", \"\" – a new animated entry in the \"My Little Pony\" franchise developed by Lauren Faust and \"Deltora Quest\" alongside reruns of the Jim Henson series \"Fraggle Rock\" and the preschool-oriented programs \"Animal Mechanicals\" and \"The WotWots\".\n\nIn a June 2011 debt filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Discovery Communications indicated that the channel may be worth less than previously believed, based on low viewership figures. The management of The Hub subsequently underwent a fair value analysis of the channel. A Discovery Communications spokesperson considered the action to be \"a pro-forma accounting exercise\", and noted that Discovery felt \"very positive, and encouraged by The Hub's early days' performance, and ability to grow its audience in the future.\"\n\nIn March 2013, The Hub picked up its first work from POW! Entertainment, \"Stan Lee's Mighty 7\", an animated pilot film to be aired in early 2014. The network also began to phase in an amended branding as the Hub Network. In late 2013, Hub Network introduced an updated logo, and a new imaging campaign, \"Making Family Fun\", which was developed by the Los Angeles-based agency Oishii Creative.\n\nOn June 12, 2014, it was reported that Margaret Loesch would step down from her role as Hub Network president and CEO by the end of the year. On September 17, 2014, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Discovery Communications was preparing to acquire a controlling stake in Hub Network from Hasbro and then retool it as Discovery Family. Along with Discovery's CFO Andrew Warren, Hasbro staff acknowledged that increasing competition in the children's media landscape – especially by subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix – had an effect on the overall performance of the network and Hasbro's original content. As it was majority-owned by a competitor, other major toy companies such as Mattel refused to purchase advertising time on Hub Network, affecting its ability to air advertising that targeted its main audience; by 2014, the network had made only $9 million per year. Discovery staff was also unable to display a full commitment to Hub Network's operation, due to factors such as the troubled launch of the Oprah Winfrey Network. Believing that they had overvalued its stake in the venture, Hasbro decided to cede the operation of the network to Discovery so it could focus more on content and its core toy business.\n\nDiscovery and Hasbro publicly announced the planned re-branding on September 25, 2014, Hasbro's CEO Brian Goldner explained that Discovery Family would be the \"next chapter\" in its joint venture with Discovery, \"[combining] highly rated award-winning storytelling around Hasbro's brands and Discovery's most popular non-fiction shows that appeal to both children and families alike.\" Hub Network was re-launched as Discovery Family on October 13, 2014 – just over four years since the original launch of The Hub. With these changes, Discovery Communications now holds a 60% stake in the joint venture; Hasbro continues to hold a 40% stake in Discovery Family, and continues to program the network's daytime lineup with children's programming. Following the re-launch, the network's primetime lineup was replaced by reruns of family-oriented factual programming from Discovery Channel's library. Henry Schleiff, who leads sister networks such as Destination America and Investigation Discovery, leads the re-launched network, with Tom Cosgrove (who previously served as CEO of Discovery Channel and Science) as general manager.\n\nIn re-launching Hub Network, Discovery executives noted that there would be a larger emphasis on programming of interest to both children and their parents; Warren argued that since ABC Family had become, in his opinion, aimed towards teenage girls, there was a gap in the broadcasting industry for a new, family-oriented network. With these shifts in the network's operation, it was announced on October 7, 2014 that \"\" – a sequel to \"Transformers: Prime\" that had been scheduled to premiere on Hub Network, would instead air on Cartoon Network. Hasbro Studios president Stephen Davis felt that Cartoon Network was a more appropriate home for a \"Transformers\" series due to its male-oriented demographics, describing Hub Network's lineup as being \"traditionally skewed towards girls\". Other recent \"Transformers\" animated series preceding the original launch of The Hub also aired on Cartoon Network. Davis remarked that Hasbro was still \"100% committed\" to its joint venture with Discovery. Despite the move for \"Robots in Disguise\", fellow Hub Network \"Transformers\" series \"\" would remain on Discovery Family for its third season.\n\nThe majority of Discovery Family's daytime programs are animated and live-action series tied to media franchises owned by Hasbro itself, with newer series produced through the Hasbro Studios division, such as \"Pound Puppies\" and \"Transformers: Rescue Bots\". As the Hub Network, it also previously aired game shows tied to Hasbro's board games, such as \"Family Game Night\". Following the relaunch as Discovery Family, the remainder of its lineup was replaced with family-oriented science and nature-related programs from its sister network Discovery Channel such as \"Africa\", \"Extreme Engineering: Big Reveals\", \"Flying Wild Alaska\" and \"Time Warp\".\n\nOne of the network's most noteworthy series has been \"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic\", an animated series developed and first produced by Lauren Faust which is associated with the recent reboot of Hasbro's \"My Little Pony\" franchise. The series not only became The Hub's highest-rated program within its target demographic of young girls, but attracted an unexpectedly significant cult following . \n\nThe network has also acquired new series unrelated to Hasbro properties, including \"The Aquabats! Super Show!\", \"Dan Vs.\", \"Majors & Minors\", \"\" and \"SheZow\", while four of its programs, \"Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures\", \"The Twisted Whiskers Show\", \"Maryoku Yummy\" and \"\", came from properties of American Greetings.\n\nDuring its years as the Hub Network, the channel also aired reruns of other outside series, such as \"Fraggle Rock\" and \"\", a collection of various Warner Bros. Animation series, such as \"Batman Beyond\", \"\", \"\", \"Animaniacs\", and \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", a few former Fox Kids shows such as \"Goosebumps\" and \"\", and various off-network sitcoms (at the end of the Hub Network's run, these included \"Blossom\", \"Step by Step\" and \"Sister, Sister\"); \"Blossom\", the only sitcom on Discovery Family's schedule, returned for a time in 2016. A limited amount of original Discovery Kids programming, such as \"Adventure Camp\" and \"Flight 29 Down\", remained on the lineup upon its launch as The Hub.\n\nDiscovery Family operates one feed nationally, and does not operate a timeshift feed for the west coast. A 1080i high-definition simulcast of the network was introduced alongside its re-launch as The Hub, with Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, and AT&T U-verse as the first to carry the HD feed.\n\nOn March 31, 2016, the pan-EMEA version of Discovery World was re-launched, as a regional version of Discovery Family.\n\nOn September 14, 2017, a French version was launched in France.\n"}

These contracts are usually regulated by different countries' labour laws, to ensure that employers still fulfill basic labour rights regardless of a contract's form, particularly unjust dismissal. Generally, fixed-term contracts will automatically be deemed to have created a permanent contract, subject to the employer's right to terminate employment on reasonable notice for a good reason. In the European Union the incidence of fixed-term contracts ranges from 6% in the UK to 23% in Spain, with Germany, Italy and France between 13% and 16%.\n\nDue to the potential job insecurity that multiple fixed-term contracts may cause, employment laws in many countries limit the circumstances and the way these contracts may be used. In countries where labour law is more restrictive (compensation/indemnity for dismissal), the differentiation between fixed-term and permanent contracts tends to be clearly set out in law. Where employment legislation is less protective for the employee there tends to be a lesser degree of differentiation between fixed and permanent contracts.\n\nThere are two possibilities to contract successive fixed-term contracts:\n\n\nThe maximum term is twenty four months and may be extended once only\n\nFixed-term contracts may not be extended more than three times with a maximum total period of two years.\n\nIndia allows fixed term employment since 2018.

{"id": "26999580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26999580", "title": "Hannes Androsch", "text": "Hannes Androsch\n\nJohannes \"Hannes\" Androsch is an Austrian entrepreneur and consultant; a former Social Democrat top politician who served as an Austrian minister of finance from 1970 to 1981 and additionally as vice chancellor from 1976 to 1981; and a former banker who from 1981 to 1988 was the general director of the Creditanstalt-Bankverein (Austria’s leading bank at that time) and subsequently an advisor to the World Bank. From 1989 onward he built an industrial investment group, Androsch International Consulting (AIC), which is a major factor in Austria's internationally active corporate landscape. In addition, Androsch's foundation is an important sponsor of research and development activities in Austria, where he is regularly consulted on matters of political, economic and financial importance.\n\nAndrosch was born on 18 April 1938 in Vienna, where his parents, Hans and Lia, were tax advisors in the district Floridsdorf. The family lived through the end of World War II in Southern Bohemia, where they witnessed the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia in June 1945. His mother placed seven-year-old Hannes on the window sill and instructed him to watch the events closely so that he would never forget.\nAndrosch concluded his high school education in Vienna in 1956. He proceeded to study business administration at the University of World Trade (today's Vienna University of Economics and Business), where he obtained his diploma in 1959, followed by a doctorate in 1969.\n\nHis political activities manifested early, and took him to the top position in the Vienna branch of the student organization of the Socialist party (1960–1961), and then to leadership of the national organization (1962–1963). Thereafter, at the age of only 25 years, he became secretary for economic issues in the club of the Socialist members of parliament, a position which he held until 1966.\n\n1967 was a fateful year for Androsch: he was certified as a public accountant and tax advisor, allowing him to participate in the financial consulting enterprise which his parents had significantly expanded; and he became a member of parliament for the Socialist party where he earned himself a reputation as a shooting star. When Bruno Kreisky turned the tables on Austria's political scenery with the 1970 national election he made the 32-year-old Androsch Finance minister in his first minority cabinet on 21 April 1970. Androsch continued in this function when the Socialist single-party government consolidated its dominance through the absolute majorities won in the elections of 1971 and 1975. Although he had not been Kreisky's first choice for this position (Schachner-Blazizek and Felix Slavik had declined) the two men developed a working relationship that was, initially, very good. Androsch became a strong advocate of Keynesian economics, in a modification that became known as “Austro-Keynesianism.”\n\nOn 1 October 1976 Androsch was made Vice-Chancellor of Austria while remaining minister of finance. In this capacity he became chairman of the OECD at ministerial level in 1979, and also served as chairman of the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund.\n\nWhile Androsch had built an excellent political network within the centrist wing of the Socialist party and especially the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB), not everybody was happy with his rapid rise. The fact that the Austrian print media, who for the most part venerated Kreisky and had adorned him with the nickname \"Sun King,\" started to refer to Androsch as the \"Crown Prince\" did not help. When in 1975 Androsch differed with Kreisky on how to handle the reconfiguration of Austria's state-owned industry, and expressed his wish to become president of the national bank\ninstead of continuing in the government, Kreisky himself became suspicious of the young man he had mentored for years. He started to take exception to a highly problematic incompatibility that had been public knowledge since Androsch became a member of the government: he still owned the tax advisor company (renamed Consultatio in 1970) which he had taken over from his parents, although he had placed it in escrow when he became a finance minister.\n\nTowards the end of 1980, after long and intense campaigns by Austria's media and a continued deterioration of his relationship with Kreisky, Androsch resigned from his political positions on 20 January 1981.\n\nThe government appointed Androsch as the governor of the state-owned Creditanstalt, Austria’s leading bank at that time, a little later in 1981. However, he continued to face heavy opposition and revelations made by investigative journalists (especially Alfred Worm), that culminated in a series of investigations of his personal financial conduct, which in part predated his public role or were not demonstrably connected with it. Androsch has repeatedly stated (and has repeated these allegations in a series of interviews published by the Austrian newspaper \"Die Presse\" in February and March 2010; see sources) that his Socialist successors in the finance ministry, Herbert Salcher and Franz Vranitzky (who had been Androsch's secretary, and would later rise to chancellorship) had conspired with Kreisky, \"who was simply jealous\", (and with political opponent Alois Mock) to \"construe the financial and legal proceedings against him\", that would not be finally settled for the following 16 years. \"I had no chance to even be heard. And many who have participated in this vendetta would now rather pretend that nothing had ever happened.\"\n\nA central point of Androsch's defence concerning his personal finances — he claimed that a rich \"uncle-by-choice\" (\"Wahlonkel\" in German) had provided him with significant funds, and habitually replied \"alas, no\" when asked if he was a millionaire — did not hold. On 8 October 1991 Androsch was convicted by the Vienna Regional Criminal Court of having evaded taxes between 1974 and 1983 in the amount of about five million Austrian schillings (roughly corresponding to EUR 500,000 expressed in 2010 currency), a minuscule fraction of the original allegations. He was sentenced to a fine of 1.8 million Austrian schillings.\n\nA legally separate but politically related affair (a conviction for false testimony to the parliamentary examination board investigating the scandal surrounding the Vienna General Hospital) forced Androsch to resign from the Creditanstalt post in January 1988. With the help of a Swiss member of the Bilderberg Group, he became a consultant to the World Bank, especially for China and parts of Africa, until 1989. Androsch is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.\n\nIn 1989 Androsch founded AIC Androsch International Management Consulting GmbH, which in 1994 commenced its corporate investment and acquisition activity. Its offices are situated at the Ringstraße, opposite the Vienna opera house.\n\nBy way of AIC, Androsch is co-owner and president of the supervisory board of the following Austrian companies:\n\n\nFormer investments of Androsch's holdings included major stakes in Future Advanced Composite Components (FACC) AG in Ried im Innkreis (acquired by Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation in 2009) and in KTM Sportmotorcycle AG. In 2000, he was a major founding investor of Austrian prepaid payment method paysafecard, until it was finally sold to British Skrill group for 140 million euros in 2014.\n\nAndrosch is also president of the supervisory board of the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT; formerly Austrian Research Centers, ARC) in Seibersdorf, and deputy chairman of the supervisory board of FIMBAG Finanzmarktbeteiligung AG, the vehicle through which the state-owned Österreichische Industrieholding controls its stakes in Austrian banking system. He has been chairman of the Council of the University of Leoben.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Refco, a class-action lawsuitsuit in the US caused considerable difficulties for BAWAG P.S.K., the Austrian trade union's bank. Androsch and other Austrian investors formed a consortium with Cerberus Capital Management, which acquired the bank in\n2006.\n\nIn 2006 the Austrian economics magazine \"trend\" estimated Androsch's wealth at EUR 420 million, ranking him 25th among the wealthiest Austrians. Using a modified rating that also considered networking, the magazine ranked him the 22nd most powerful person in Austria's economy in 2009.\n\nOn 21 June 2004, the founding session of the Hannes Androsch Foundation within the Austrian Academy of Sciences was held. It is dedicated to \"the consolidation of social balance and peace.\" Androsch endowed it with EUR 1 million and committed himself to increase the annual budget to EUR 10 million until 2012. It awards the Hannes Androsch Prize (EUR 100,000 for 2011) for scientific contributions to its goals. According to the academy, this is the most important private non-profit foundation established in Austria since 1945.\n\nAndrosch is a member of the fundraising committee of the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology, a joint initiative of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nAndrosch has been awarded a significant number of international honors, among them an honorary doctorate in economics from the University of New Orleans\n\n\n\n"}

Joe Carstairs' legal father was Scottish army officer Captain Albert Carstairs, first of the Royal Irish Rifles and later the Princess of Wales's Own. Captain Carstairs re-enlisted with the Army the week before Joe was born; he and Evelyn divorced soon afterwards. At least one biographer has suggested that the Captain may not have been Joe's biological father.\n\nCarstairs' mother, an alcoholic and drug addict, later married Captain Francis Francis, with whom she had two more children, Evelyn (Sally) Francis and Francis Francis Jr. (Frank). She divorced Captain Francis to marry French count Roger de Périgny in 1915, but eventually left him because of his infidelity. Her fourth and last husband, whom she married in 1920, was Serge Voronoff, a Russian–French surgeon who become famous in the 1920s and 1930s for his practice of transplanting monkey testicle tissue into male humans for the claimed purpose of rejuvenation. For some years Evelyn had believed in Voronoff's theories, and she funded his research and acted as his laboratory assistant at the Collège de France in Paris. Evelyn died in March 1921.\n\nJoe Carstairs married a childhood friend, the French aristocrat Count Jacques de Pret, on 7 January 1918 in Paris. The purpose of the marriage was simply to allow Carstairs access to her trust fund independently of her mother. The marriage was annulled immediately after her mother's death, on the grounds of non-consummation. By means of a Deed poll, she renounced her married name and resumed using the name Carstairs in February 1922.\n\nCarstairs lived a colourful life. She usually dressed as a man, had tattooed arms, and loved machines, adventure and speed. Openly lesbian, she had numerous affairs with women, including Dolly Wilde—Oscar Wilde's niece and a fellow ambulance driver from Dublin with whom she had lived in Paris—and a string of actresses, most notably Greta Garbo, Tallulah Bankhead, and Marlene Dietrich.\n\nDuring World War I, Carstairs served in France with the American Red Cross, driving ambulances. After the war, she served with the Royal Army Service Corps in France, re-burying the war-dead, and in Dublin with the Women's Legion Mechanical Transport Section, which acted as transport for British officers during the Irish War of Independence. In 1920, with three former colleagues from the Women's Legion Mechanical Transport Section, she started the 'X Garage,' a car-hire and chauffeuring service that featured a women-only staff of drivers and mechanics. Carstairs (and her friends and lovers) lived in a flat above the garage, which was situated near Cromwell Gardens in London's fashionable South Kensington district.\n\nSeveral of the X-Garage staff had served as drivers during the war and spoke French, German, or Italian. The cars and drivers could be hired for long-distance trips and the business specialised in taking grieving relatives for visits to war-graves and former battlefields in France and Belgium. They were also hired for journeys within London and the garage had an arrangement with the Savoy Hotel to transport guests to the theatre or to shows. During the early 1920s, X-Garage cars were a familiar sight in London's fashionable circles.\n\nIn 1925, X-Garage closed and Carstairs inherited a fortune via her mother and grandmother from Standard Oil. She also purchased her first motorboat and was also given a Steiff doll by a girlfriend, Ruth Baldwin (1905 – August, 1937), naming it \"Lord Tod Wadley\". She became exceptionally attached to this doll, keeping it with her until her death, although—unlike Donald Campbell's mascot 'Mr Whoppit'—she didn't take it into her speedboats for fear of losing it. She had clothes made for it in Saville Row and had its name placed with her own on the name plaque on the door of her London apartment.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1930, Carstairs spent considerable time in powerboats and became a very successful racer, although the Harmsworth Trophy she longed for always eluded her. She did take the Duke of York's trophy and establish herself as the fastest woman on water. Intrigued by the hydrofoil designs of Alexander Graham Bell and Casey Baldwin in Nova Scotia, Carstairs ordered a 30-foot hydrofoil boat from the Bell Boatyard in Baddeck, Nova Scotia which was intended to achieve 115 mph and capture the Harmsworth Cup. However circumstances caused her to withdraw and the boat was completed with a more economical engine delivering 57 mph. During this time, the North American press erroneously began referring to her as \"Betty,\" a nickname she loathed; she claimed that journalists used it out of spite.\n\nCarstairs was also known for her generosity to her friends. She was close to several male racing drivers and land speed record competitors, using her considerable wealth to assist them. She paid $10,000 of her money to fund the building of one of the \"Blue Bird\" land speed record cars for Sir Malcolm Campbell, who once described her as, \"the greatest sportsman I know.\" She was equally generous to John Cobb, whose Railton Special was powered by the pair of engines from her powerboat \"Estelle V.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Carstairs invested $40,000 purchasing the island of Whale Cay in the Bahamas where she lavishly hosted such guests as Marlene Dietrich and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. She not only constructed a Great House for herself and her guests, but also a lighthouse, school, church, and cannery. She later expanded these properties by also buying the additional islands of Bird Cay, Cat Cay, Devil's Cay, half of Hoffman's Cay and a tract of land on Andros.\n\nAfter selling Whale Cay in 1975, Carstairs relocated to Miami, Florida.\n\nCarstairs died in Naples, Florida, in 1993 at the age of 93. Lord Tod Wadley was cremated with her. Their ashes and those of Ruth Baldwin were buried by the sea near the Old Whaler's Church (Sag Harbor), New York.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This helps foster trust from consumers buying products or financial services. It also ensures consumers or professionals do not get injured or worse from non-compliant products. It helps companies which comply to stay in business and not lose market share to rogue traders.\n\nIn the European Union, Member States are responsible for market surveillance. Their action is done under the hat of The European Commission regulations about product safety for consumer products and other regulations for professional products. Regulation 765-2008 applies for consumer products and Regulation 882-2004 applies for food products. For medicines studies are carried out. Toys \nAt European Union level three Directorates General are in charge: Health and consumers, Enterprise and Customs. EFTA is also putting efforts in market surveillance.\n\nProsafe is an organisation that helps European Market Surveillance authorities cooperate better. The European Commission financially supports its activities. Prosafe is active in training, better communication between Member States and also does Joint Actions (JA) that bring together some Member States to control the same products at the same period, like lighters, lawnmowers or sunbeds.\n\nFor consumer goods an information system about dangerous goods has been set up, which is called RAPEX. Every week, one can see which products were voluntarily recalled or which were retrieved from the market by the authorities. \nRAPEX is one element of the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) which ensures high level of protection of consumers by stating key elements for the safety of the products.\n\nADCO stand for Administrative Cooperation Group. Representatives of Member States meet to exchange information and discuss about issues regarding the implementation of the directive(s) followed by the working group. The European Commission is also present. ADCO groups discuss about specific laws like PED or EMC Electro Magnetic Compatibility and also LVD.\n\nThe European industry is now asking for more market surveillance, be it from companies or the industry associations.\nMarket surveillance and border controls are essential to fulfil policy goals such as health and safety of end-users, protection of the environment and establishment of a fair level playing field among economic operators.\n\nIf market surveillance fails to fulfil its function, non compliant products circulate freely in the internal market, posing risk to end-users. Moreover, lawful manufacturers face unfair competition from rogue traders who simply do not invest in product compliance and traceability, who add between 2% to 25% on product costs (depending on the product category). It is also estimated that a high percentage of cases of non-compliance in certain product categories discredit the image of all the products of this kind, even the compliant ones.\n\nAn Industry Support platform was launched in 2011 - The web-platform is designed to serve as a resource database of technical documents from European machinery industries. Information is available by sector and will be made available in several languages. In addition, the website is enriched with testimonials from industrialists and any other relevant information market surveillance.\n\nEuropean machinery industries which link up in this initiative show firm commitment to help improve market surveillance for capital goods in the EU. This voluntary initiative should be seen as complementary to governmental efforts under the EU’s New Legislative Framework for marketing of products. It testifies to the commitment of industry to help maintain high levels of health, safety and environmental standards and ensure a level playing field in the single market.\n\nThe European customs are now more involved in market surveillance and with the Regulation 768/2008 are drafting guidelines to check in a more efficient manner products entering the European market.\n\nMarket surveillance is key to a level playing field competition for companies and is vital for consumer safety.\nThe lack of market surveillance has been pointed out by many players in Europe, especially in France by a member of the Parliament. At the European Parliament voices are also heard about the risk posed to the single market by the lack of market surveillance \nSome articles conformity is easy to check like clothes but some industrial products are difficult to check due to lack of time or lack of knowledge from market surveillance authorities.\nThe amount of products arriving each day for example in Europe is extremely high.\n\n"}

{"id": "505170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505170", "title": "News values", "text": "News values\n\nAmong the many lists of news values that have been drawn up by scholars and journalists, some, like Galtung and Ruge's, attempt to describe news practices across cultures, while others have become remarkably specific to the press of certain (often Western) nations. These lists show the considerable overlap in the conceptualization of news values, while at the same time point to the vastly different aspects of news production that news values may refer to (see further discussion of this point in the section ‘Conditions of news’ below).\n\nGaltung and Ruge, in their seminal study in the area put forward a system of twelve factors describing events that together are used as a definition of 'newsworthiness'. Focusing on newspapers and broadcast news, Galtung and Ruge devised a list describing what they believed were significant contributing factors as to how the news is constructed. Their theory argues that the more an event accessed these criteria the more likely it was to be reported on in a newspaper. Furthermore, three basic hypotheses are presented by Galtung and Ruge: the additivity hypothesis that the more factors an event satisfies, the higher the probability that it becomes news; the complementarity hypothesis that the factors will tend to exclude each other; and the exclusion hypothesis that events that satisfy none or very few factors will not become news.\n\nAccording to A. Boyd: \"News journalism has a broadly agreed set of values, often referred to as 'newsworthiness'...\"The language of news is linear, elaborating on event report along a single dimension with added information, illustration, quotation and discussion. More often than not it is the news values of a particular event that slots it into the number one position but perceptions as regards news values can differ. News values, sometimes called news criteria, determine how much attention a news story is given by a media outlet, and the attention it is given by the audience. They explain how editors and other journalists decide that one piece of information is news while another is not. News values are not universal and can vary widely between different cultures. In Western practice, decisions on the selection and prioritization of news are made by editors on the basis of their experience and intuition, although analysis by J. Galtung and M. Ruge showed that several factors are consistently applied across a range of news organizations.This theory tested on the news presented in four different Norwegian newspapers from the Congo and Cuba crises of July 1960 and the Cyprus crisis of March-April 1964, and the data are in the majority of cases found to be consistent with their theory. Some of these factors are listed below, together with others put forward by Schlesinger and Bell. According to Ryan, \"there is no end to lists of news criteria\". In 2001, this 1965 study was updated by Tony Harcup and Deirdre O'Neill, in a study of the British press. The findings of a content analysis of three major national newspapers in the UK were used to evaluate critically Galtung and Ruge's original criteria and to propose a contemporary set of news values. Forty years on, they found some notable differences, including the rise of celebrity news values and that good news (as well as bad news) was a significant news value, as well as the newspaper's own agenda. They examined three tabloid news papers.\n\nA variety of external and internal pressures influence journalists' decisions on which stories are covered, how issues are interpreted and the emphasis given to them. These pressures can sometimes lead to bias or unethical reporting. Achieving relevance, giving audiences the news they want and find interesting, is an increasingly important goal for media outlets seeking to maintain market share in a rapidly evolving market. This has made news organizations more open to audience input and feedback, and forced them to adopt and apply news values that attract and keep audiences. \nGiven these changes and the rapid rise of digital technology in recent years, Harcup and O’Neill updated their own study in 2016. The growth of interactive media and citizen journalism is fast altering the traditional distinction between news producer and passive audience and may in future lead to a deep-ploughing redefinition of what 'news' means and the role of the news industry. Social media enable members of the public both to access and to give an account of evidence crucial to the reporting of a story that is missed by the official media.\n\nIn 2018, Hal Pashler and Gail Heriot published a study showing that perceptions of newsworthiness tend to be contaminated by a political usefulness bias. In other words, individuals tend to view stories that give them \"ammunition\" for their political views as more newsworthy. They give credence to their own views.\n\nWhat should be clear from this list of conditions for news is that many different factors have the potential to influence whether an event is first noticed by a news organisation, second whether a story will be written about that event, and third whether this story will end up being published as news. To give a few examples:\n\nSome researchers (e.g. Galtung & Ruge 1965, p. 67; Bell 1991, p. 159; Gans 2004, pp. 78–9; and Brighton & Foy 2007, p. 26) suggest that Composition and Co-option are news values that concern how news stories fit with the other stories around them. The aim here is to ensure a balanced spread of stories with minimal duplication across a news program or edition (Brighton & Foy 2007, p. 26).\n\nEditors have a particular target audience in mind. Each news output has its own system of setting its news agenda. Other conditions/criteria relate to the news agenda. Here some researchers propose the news values of Frequency, Continuity, The News Barrier, Predictability, Follow-up and News Agenda among others (Galtung & Ruge 1965, p. 66-7; Østgaard 1965, p. 51; Schulz 1982, p. 151; Bell 1991, pp. 15, 151; Harcup & O’Neill 2001, p. 279). Bell (1991, p. 15) sums up the rationale for considering these as news values by stating quite simply that ‘once something is in the news, it tends to stay there’. This means that when an issue is on the news agenda, other events concerning the same issue are more likely to be reported as news because they fit the news agenda.\n\nOther criteria listed above relate quite specifically to the news actors or events that have the potential to be reported as news. Personalization, for example, concerns the actions of individuals and whether an event can be contextualised in more personal terms (affecting specific people, not the generalised masses).\n\nSome researchers try to tease apart the different aspects of the news production process that these conditions apply to as well as the many different perspectives from which news values can be viewed and analysed. For example, recent research by Bednarek & Caple (2017) adopts a discursive perspective on news values analysis, and examines only those news values that relate specifically to news actors and the events they are involved in. Their approach to the systematic analysis of news values in both verbal and visual news reporting is called discursive news values analysis, or DNVA. \n\nConventional models concentrate on what the journalist perceives as news. But the news process is a two-way transaction, involving both news producer (the journalist) and the news receiver (the audience), although boundary between the two is rapidly blurring with the growth of citizen journalism and interactive media.\n\nLittle has been done to define equivalent factors that determine audience perception of news. This is largely because it would appear impossible to define a common factor, or factors, that generate interest in a mass audience.\n\nBasing his judgement on many years as a newspaper journalist Hetherington (1985) states that: “…anything which threatens people’s peace, prosperity and well being is news and likely to make headlines”.\nWhyte-Venables (2012) suggests audiences may interpret news as a risk signal. Psychologists and primatologists have shown that apes and humans constantly monitor the environment for information that may signal the possibility of physical danger or threat to the individual’s social position. This receptiveness to risk signals is a powerful and virtually universal survival mechanism.\n\nA 'risk signal' is characterized by two factors, an element of change (or uncertainty) and the relevance of that change to the security of the individual.\n\nThe same two conditions are observed to be characteristic of news. The news value of a story, if defined in terms of the interest it carries for an audience, is determined by the degree of change it contains and the relevance that change has for the individual or group. Analysis shows that journalists and publicists manipulate both the element of change and relevance (‘security concern’) to maximize, or some cases play down, the strength of a story.\n\nSecurity concern is proportional to the relevance of the story for the individual, his or her family, social group and societal group, in declining order. At some point there is a Boundary of Relevance, beyond which the change is no longer perceived to be relevant, or newsworthy. This boundary may be manipulated by journalists, power elites and communicators seeking to encourage audiences to exclude, or embrace, certain groups: for instance, to distance a home audience from the enemy in time of war, or conversely, to highlight the plight of a distant culture so as to encourage support for aid programs.\n\nAn evolutionary psychology explanation for why negative news have a higher news value than positive news starts with the empirical observation that the human perceptive system and lower level brain functions have difficulty distinguishing between media stimuli and real stimuli. These lower level brain mechanisms which function on a subconscious level make basic evaluations of perceptive stimuli, focus attention on important stimuli, and start basic emotional reactions. Research has also found that the brain differentiates between negative and positive stimuli and reacts quicker and more automatically to negative stimuli which are also better remembered. This likely has evolutionary explanations with it often being important to quickly focus attention on, evaluate, and quickly respond to threats. While the reaction to a strong negative stimulus is to avoid, a moderately negative stimulus instead causes curiosity and further examination. Negative media news is argued to fall into the latter category which explains their popularity. Lifelike audiovisual media are argued to have particularly strong effects compared to reading.\n\nWomen have on average stronger avoidance reactions to moderately negative stimuli. They point to negative news as the main reason for avoiding international news. The stronger avoidance reaction to moderately negative stimuli can be explained evolutionary as it being the role of men to investigate and potentially respond aggressively to the threat while women and children withdraw. Men and women also differ on average on how they enjoy, evaluate, remember, comprehend, and identify with the people in negative news depending on if the news are negatively or positively framed.

{"id": "1617435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1617435", "title": "Parallel import", "text": "Parallel import\n\nA parallel import is a non-counterfeit product imported from another country without the permission of the intellectual property owner. Parallel imports are often referred to as grey product and are implicated in issues of international trade, and intellectual property.\n\nParallel importing is based on concept of exhaustion of intellectual property rights: according to this concept, when the product is first launched on the market in a particular jurisdiction, parallel importation is authorized to all residents in the state in question. Some countries allow it but others do not.\n\nParallel importing of pharmaceuticals reduces price of pharmaceuticals by introducing competition; TRIPS agreement in Article 6 states that this practice cannot be challenged under the WTO dispute settlement system and so is effectively a matter of national discretion.\n\nThe practice of parallel importing is often advocated in the case of software, music, printed texts and electronic products, and occurs for several reasons:\n\n\nParallel importing is regulated differently in different jurisdictions; there is no consistency in laws dealing with parallel imports between countries. Neither the Berne Convention nor the Paris Convention explicitly prohibit parallel importation.\n\nThe Australian market is an example of a relatively small consumer market which does not benefit from the economies of scale and competition available in the larger global economies. Australia tends to have lower levels of competition in many industries and oligopolies are common in industries like banking, supermarkets, and mobile telecommunications.\n\nPrivate Enterprise will use product segmentation strategies to legally maximise profit. This often includes varying the service levels, pricing and product features to improve so called \"fit\" to the local marketplace. However this segmentation may mean an identical products at often higher prices. This can be termed \"Price Discrimination\". With the advent of the Internet, Australian consumers can readily compare prices globally and have been able to identify products exhibiting Price Discrimination, also known as the \"Australia Tax\".\n\nIn 1991, the Australian Government resolved to remove parallel import restrictions from a range of products except cars. It followed this up with legislation making it legal to source music and software CDs from overseas and import them into Australia. An Australian Productivity Commission report recommended in July 2009 that legislation be extended to legalise the parallel importing of books, with three years' notice for publishers. The commission also recommended abolishing restrictions on parallel importing of cars.\n\nFederal Court of Australia decision shows that parallel imported items with valid trademark are subject to Section 123 of the Trade Mark Act.\n\nVarious Parliament of Australia committees have investigated allegations of Price Discrimination.\n\nThe European Union (and European Economic Area) requires the doctrine of international exhaustion to exist between member states (contracting states) but EU legislation for trade marks, design rights and copyright prohibits its application to goods put on the market outside the EU/EEA.\n\nIn Germany, the Bundesgerichtshof has held that the doctrine of international exhaustion governs parallel importation, subject to the EU rules above.\n\nIn Hong Kong, parallel importation is permitted under both, the Trade Mark and (amended) Copyright Ordinance before The Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2007 came into force 6 July.\n\nJapan's intellectual property rights law prohibits audiovisual articles marketed for export from being sold domestically, and such sale of \"re-imported\" CDs are illegal.\n\nIn the United States, legal precedent has established that parallel importation is legal. In the case of Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., the US Supreme Court held that the first-sale doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad, thus permitting importation and resale of many product categories.\n\nMoreover, Science, State, Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies, Appropriations Act of 2006 prohibits future FTAs from categorically disallowing the parallel import of patented products.\n\nThe United States has unique automobile design legislation administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Certain car makers find the required modifications too expensive. This creates demand for grey import vehicles, where certain models are modified for individual customers to meet these requirements, at a higher expense than if this were done by the original manufacturer on an assembly line. This procedure interferes with the marketing scheme of the manufacturer, who might plan to import a less powerful car and force consumers to accept it. The Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act of 1988 basically ended the gray market by requiring manufacturer certification of  U.S.-bound cars.\n\nMarkets for parallel imports and locally made products sometimes exist alongside each other even though the parallel imports are markedly more expensive. This may be for various reasons, but is mostly observed in foodstuffs and toiletry.\n\nDue to the nature of hotels, travellers often have little information on where to shop except in the immediate vicinity. Grocery shops opened to serve brand-name hotels often feature parallel-imported foodstuffs and toiletry to cater to travellers so that they can easily recognise the product they have been using at home.\n\nFoodstuffs and toiletry made from different plants may vary in quality because different plants may use materials or reagents (such as water used for washing, food additives) from different sources, although they are usually subject to the same standards by internal QC or public health authorities. A person may be allergic to the foodstuff or toiletry made by some plants but not others.\n\nTo sum up, the major reasons for such a market are:\n\nA manifestation of the philosophical divide between those who support various intellectual property and those who are critical of it, is the divide over the legitimacy of parallel importation. Some believe that it benefits consumers by lowering prices and widening the selection and consumption of products available in the market, while others believe that it discourages intellectual property owners from investing in new and innovative products. Some also believe that parallel imports tend to facilitate copyright infringement.\n\nThis tension essentially concerns the rights and duties of a protected monopoly. Intellectual property rights allow the holder to sell at a price that is higher than the price one would pay in a competitive market, but by doing so the holder relinquishes sales to those who would be prepared to buy at a price between the monopoly price and the competitive price. The presence of parallel imports in the marketplace prevents the holder from exploiting the monopoly further by market segmentation, i.e. by applying different prices to different consumers.\n\nConsumer organisations tend to support parallel importation as it offers consumers more choice and lower prices, provided that consumers retain equivalent legal protection to locally sourced products (e.g. in the form of warranties with international effect), and competition is not diminished.\n\nHowever, such organisations also warn consumers of certain risks in using parallel-imported products. Although the products may have been made to comply with the laws and customs of their place of origin, these products or their use may not comply with those in places where they are used, or some of their functions may be rendered unusable or meaningless (which may needlessly drive up prices). Electronic devices, however, suffer less from this type of risk because newer models support more than one user language.\n\nImportation of computer games and computer game hardware from Asia is a common practice for some wholesale and/or retail stockists. Many consumers now take advantage of on-line stores in Hong Kong and the United States to purchase computer games at or near half the cost of a retail purchase from the Australian RRP. Often the versions sold by the Asian retailers are manufactured in Australia to begin with. An example is Crysis, which was available from Hong Kong on-line stores for approximately $50 AUD but whose retail cost in Australia was close to $100. Crysis was sold in Asia using identical versions of the game box and disc, right down to including Australian censor ratings on the box.\n\nImportation of Colgate toothpaste from Thailand into Hong Kong. The goods are bought in markets where the price is lower, and sold in markets where the price of the same goods is, for a variety of reasons, higher. Electronic goods like Apple's iPad are frequently imported in Hong Kong before they're official and resold to South-East Asian early adopters for a premium.\n\nThe practice exists of luxury car dealers in New Zealand buying Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Malaysia at a low price, and importing the cars into New Zealand to sell at a price lower than the price offered by Mercedes Benz to New Zealand consumers. There are also many parallel import dealers of electronics hardware. Parallel importing is allowed in New Zealand and has resulted in a significant lowering of margins on many products. \n\nThere is an opinion, not scientifically proven, but very popular among people in Poland that \"Western\" washing powders are more effective in cleaning than Polish, because chemistry companies allegedly produce items of higher quality for Western Europe, not as good as for Poland. Because of that, there are companies and online stores importing Western chemistry supplies to Poland (for example from Germany), even if similar brands are available there.\n\nAccording to Anatoliy Semyonov, trademark rights exhaustion turned national in 2002, and, as of April 2013, an act is being prepared that could make original goods imported without a permission of the producer officially \"counterfeit\" (by replacing things on which \"a trademark is located illegally\" with things \"on which an illegally used trademark is located\"). He notes that, according to the Criminal Code, illegal use of a trademark can be punished up to 6 years of imprisonment; and a similar article in the Offences Code makes goods with an illegal copy of a trademark subject to confiscation.\n\nSome Sony PSP video game consoles were imported into the European Economic Area from Japan up to twelve months prior to the European launch. The unusual component of this example is that some importers were selling the console for a higher price than the intended EU price, taking advantage of the relative monopoly they enjoyed. After the release the console was commonly imported from the USA where it was retailed for much lower price.\n\nOther example are smart phones, which are being imported from China, where an average device can be bought for about $100 while a similar device would be retailed for about 200€ in the EU.\n\n\n[https://www.dutchparalleltrading.com/ Statement on Parallel import and export, or parallel trade\n"}

In 1907 he took a clerical position in the engineering section of AEG in Bremen.\n\nIn 1910 Bruhn took charge of AEG’s London commercial office. He undertook war service between 1914 and 1918, and after the war he became a student at the University of Kiel, emerging in 1921 with a doctorate in Economics. \nDirectly after this Bruhn took a commercial directorship with in Kiel, and in 1927 he joined the board of directors at Junkers in Dessau. He moved again in 1929, this time to Chemnitz where he became a director at .\n\nA move into the automotive sector came in 1930 when a regional bank, the Sächsische Staatsbank, mandated him to join the board of the “Zschopauer Motorenwerke J. S. Rasmussen (DKW)”, a dynamic but structurally convoluted and financially troubled automaker in which the bank was heavily invested. Two years later, as part of a vigorous rationalisation designed to protect the future of the business, the Auto Union company was created, comprising four automobile brands that the automotive entrepreneur Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen had acquired and built up over the years. Bruhn himself was installed as Chairman of the new company in 1932, which aligned with the wishes of the company’s bankers but would create tensions with Rasmussen whose vision and energy had built up the businesses in the first place. Two years later, in 1934, it was Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen who resigned from the company. Bruhn stayed till 1945.\n\nOn 7 May 1945 Bruhn left Chemnitz, along with many of his fellow citizens. Although the area had been liberated by the American army, it had already been agreed between the victor powers under the Potsdam Agreement that the entire region would fall within the Soviet Occupation Zone and many Germans fled to the western part of Germany at this time. Bruhn, who had been a member of the Nazi Party during the Hitler years, was interned by . He underwent the denazification process. As an Auto Union director he accepted his share of the responsibility for the employment of prisoners of war at the company’s plants during the war, but he was nevertheless released, and by the end of 1945 had been able to relocate to Ingolstadt in Bavaria (which was in the ). Auto Union’s small DKW-badged cars had sold well during the 1930s, and were generally too small and slow to have been commandeered by the German military during the war or by the armies of the occupying powers after it. Many pre-war DKWs survived the war and in December 1945 it was possible to create in Ingolsadt the \"Central depot for Auto Union replacement parts\" (“Zentraldepot für Auto Union Ersatzteile GmbH “). The longer term outlook for any form of German manufacturing industry remained at this stage unclear, and Auto Union’s plant, located in the Soviet zone, was out of reach. But with financing from the and Marshall Plan funding, it was possible to create in September 1949 a new company in West Germany called Auto Union GmbH, and based at the Ingolstadt parts depot. Richard Buhn was the company’s first boss. At this stage automobile production was established in a rented factory several hundred kilometers to the west, in Düsseldorf, but in due course it would be possible to finance and built a car plant at the new company’s spacious site in Ingolstadt. The first Ingolstadt-produced Audi car would emerge from the factory, by now owned by the Volkswagen group, in 1964, the year of Bruhn’s death.\n\nOn May 26, 2014, a new investigative report was issued by AUDI that condemned Bruhn for close association with Nazi leaders and extensive use of concentration camp inmates as forced labor. http://www.thelocal.de/20140526/audi-used-forced-labour-under-nazis-in-germany\n"}

{"id": "89493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89493", "title": "São Carlos", "text": "São Carlos\n\nSão Carlos (Saint Charles, in English, ; named after Saint Charles Borromeo) is a city of 246,088 inhabitants (IBGE/2017) in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It is located at , at about 230 km from the city of São Paulo.\n\nThe region started to be settled in the end of the 18th century, with the opening of a road that led to the gold mines in Cuiabá and Goiás. Leaving from Piracicaba, passing through Rio Claro, the hills, fields and by typical vegetations of the Brazilian countryside, settlers established in the region. São Carlos' history started in 1831, when the \"Pinhal\" (Pines) allotment was demarcated.\n\nOn the city's foundation date, November 4, 1857, the population resided in some houses around the chapel and the inhabitants were mostly Arruda Botelho's family heirs, who were the first owners of the \"Pinhal\" alloments. Between 1831 and 1857 the pioneer coffee farms were formed, starting the first economic activity in the city. The coffee crops came to the \"Pinhal\" farm in 1840 and spread throughout the fertile lands around, becoming the main export item. The city foundation is credited to Antônio Carlos de Arruda Botelho, Count of Pinhal, an influent farmer and entrepreneur.\n\nSão Carlos was elevated to village in 1865, when a \"Câmara\", or ruling chamber, was created. In 1874, the village had 6,897 inhabitants, as a humble highlight of its fast growth and regional importance. It became a city in 1880 and in 1886, with a population of 16,104, its urban structure was settled.\n\nThe city arises on the coffee crops expansion context, which is relevant to the last two decades of the 19th century and to the first two of the 20th century. The arrival of the railway in 1884 provided an efficient system to transport the coffee production to the Santos harbor and boosted the economy of the region. The railway also contributed to the political and economic consolidation of the central area of the city.\n\nWhen slavery ended, government created incentives to bring in immigrants. São Carlos had already received German nationals brought by the Count of Pinhal in 1876. Between 1880 and 1904, the city was one of the most important immigration centers in São Paulo state, the majority of them being Italians - specifically, Northern Italians. They worked in coffee plantations and in manufacturing factories, as well as trading activities.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, countless cultural societies developed social activities aiming to promote literacy. Vittorio Emanuele Society in 1900 and Dante Alighieri in 1902 were but a few of them. The Italian presence was so significant that during the first half of the 20th century, the Italian government had a consulate branch in São Carlos.\n\nWith the Wall Street crash of 1929, coffee production went through a crisis, which made many immigrants leave rural areas for factories, wood artifact production, pottery, and construction.\n\nFarmers had already applied the profits obtained with coffee in the constitution of several types of companies in São Carlos: banks, electricity, cable cars, telephones, water pumps, sewers, theaters, hospitals and schools. This established a foundation for industrialization in the city. With the arrival of immigrants from other urban centers from the 1930s - 1940s, their expertise was used to consolidate industrialization as the main economic activity in the city. Its peak years were the 1950s, when São Carlos became a manufacturing center, with relevant industrial expression in São Paulo state.\n\nThe industrial sector also developed through workshops that incorporated the coffee industry. The manufacture of processing machinery, shoes, fertilizers, hardware, furniture, pasta, cigars, as well as activities such as tailory, breweries, foundries, sawmills, weaving, pottery and pencil production expanded the economy of São Carlos in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, with the expansion of refrigeration, new factories of machinery and tractors arrived. Numerous small- and medium-sized companies which provided products and services were also established.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city received a boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1953 the Escola de Engenharia de São Carlos, or the Engineering School of the University of São Paulo, was created. In the 1970s, the Federal University of São Carlos was launched.\n\nSão Carlos is located on the geographic center of the São Paulo state, approximately from the city of São Paulo. The city is the center of a microregion with 308,777 inhabitants.\n\nIts altitude is over 856 m, offering a mild altitude climate. Most of the year the city is windy, sunny and with mild temperatures at night. For this reason the city is nicknamed \"\"Cidade do Clima\" (Weather City) and celebrates once a year an event called \"Festa do Clima\"\", or \"Weather Festival\".\n\nThe city has a total area of 1.141 km², which includes two districts to the north (\"Santa Eudóxia\" and \"Água Vermelha\"), one district to the west (\"Bela Vista São-carlense\"), and one district to the east (\"Vila Nery\").\n\nAccording to the Köppen Climate Classification, the city has an altitude tropical climate with dry winter, with minimum average temperatures of 15,3 °C and maximum of 27,0 °C.\n\nThe city has an active industrial profile with important national and international industries and certain agricultural importance, backed by technologies developed by Embrapa, owner of two research complexes in the city. Due to its increasing number of high technology industries, the city has been proclaimed \"The National Capital of Technology\" by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in 2011.\n\nThe city hosts several locally-grown technology-based companies, such as Opto Eletrônicos, and factories of multinational corporations such as Faber Castell, Electrolux, Husqvarna, Tecumseh and the Brazilian plant of Volkswagen engines, and national corporations such as TAM MRO - Technology Center, Toalhas São Carlos, Tapetes São Carlos, Papel São Carlos, Prominas Brasil and Latina.\n\nThe economic basis of São Carlos is the tertiary sector. Commerce and services corresponds to 65.9% of the city's GDP. Industry is also relevant. With 32.3% of the economy, the secondary sector has a bigger participation than the state of São Paulo's average. The primary sector corresponds to 1.7% of the GDP.\n\nSão Carlos is home to two Universidade de São Paulo campuses and the Universidade Federal de São Carlos (UFSCar), two of the most important higher learning centers in Brazil. Moreover, another minor and private university, Centro Universitário Central Paulista (UNICEP), is also based in São Carlos, and community colleges like SENAI, SESI, SESC, SENAC and the \"Escola Técnica Estadual Paulino Botelho\". This has turned São Carlos into a university-oriented town, with an abundance of student-focused commercial establishments. It is also known for its student parties.\n\nSão Carlos' cultural life is marked by a young audience that enjoys musical concerts of Brazilian contemporary alternative artists that usually include the city in their tours. Also, São Carlos has 3 theaters and 7 commercial movie-theaters rooms.\n\nThere are two important events celebrated every year in the city, the \"Climate Party\", which happens in April and has a traditional \"Orchid Exposition\" which features a craftwork fair and several food barracks. An Oktobertech fest is held yearly along with the São Carlos High Tech Fair (Fealtec).\n\nThe TAM Airlines Wings of a Dream Museum (\"Museu TAM\") was in São Carlos, from central São Carlos.\n\n\nThe city is served by Mário Pereira Lopes Airport, where one of the maintenance bases of TAM Airlines is located and well as the air and space TAM Museum, owned and maintained by the company.\n\nWere born in São Carlos:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57110834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57110834", "title": "The Wing (workspace)", "text": "The Wing (workspace)\n\nThe Wing is a women's co-working space collective and club with offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York City, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. It was founded by Audrey Gelman and Lauren Kassan in 2016. As of October 2018, the club has about 6,000 members.\n\nAudrey Gelman, co-founder and CEO of The Wing, began her career working on Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. On the campaign, Gelman managed communications and ensured quick response from her team. Gelman also worked on the 2013 campaign of the New York City comptroller Scott Stringer. Most recently she worked in political and social affairs serving as Senior Vice President at the strategic communications firm SKDKnickerbocker. Gelman has been named one of \"Fast Company\"'s \"Most Creative People in Business\", \"Forbes\" Magazine's \"30 under 30\", one of the \"50 Most Powerful Women in New York\" by \"The New York Daily News\", and one of \"Buzzfeed\"s \"21 Amazing Role Models for Twentysomethings.\"\n\nLauren Kassan received her Bachelor of Arts/Science from The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. After graduating, Kassan worked with fitness startups. She worked with now big name fitness startups such as SLT—a New York boutique fitness studio—where she eventually became the director of business development. Kassan also worked for ClassPass where she focused on the development of the startup's studio network. Kassan is well experienced in operations and community management and is the co-founder and COO of the women's co-working space, The Wing.\n\nThe initial idea for The Wing stemmed from Gelman's personal desire for a space to change and relax between business meetings as she lived in Brooklyn, but worked in SoHo and Washington DC. The first title for this not-yet-created space was \"Refresh\". When Kassan and Gelman began working together, they decided \"The Wing\" was a more fitting name, since it would represent a \"wing\" of the users' home away from their actual home. When developing this idea, the two decided to focus on creating a space where women can feel safe and supported.\n\nIn October of 2016, Gelman and Kassan began The Wing's foundation in New York City's Flatiron District, on the Ladies' Mile Historic District. They subsequently opened another branch in a loft in SoHo. The Wing opened a new space in April 2018 in Brooklyn in DUMBO neighborhood, and spaces in Washington D.C. and San Francisco in 2018.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., facility includes a booth dedicated to Anita Hill. The San Francisco space includes a conference room dedicated to Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nOn March 1, 2018, the New York City Commission on Human Rights started a \"commission-initiated\" investigation into how The Wing membership system operates. According to the application rules of the Wing, men cannot become members of The Wing or visit as guests. Nevertheless, the club says it will accept members who are \"living as a woman\" and will review applicants' social media to determine their identity. This requirement, however, may exclude people who are gender nonconforming or who do not identify on the gender binary, which became one of the reasons for the investigation to emerge, since New York prohibits discrimination on the basis of \"gender identity\" and \"gender expression.\"\n\nRepresentatives from The Wing planned a meeting to discuss the issues with NYCC, disputing the accuracy of the term \"investigation.\" Instead, the company described the inquiry as a collaborative process. \"All that's happened is that The Wing and the Commission have agreed, mutually, to sit down and have a conversation,\" said Karen Dunn of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, who is representing the company in the matter. \"We are looking forward to working with The Wing to ensure that they are in compliance with the law,\" said Seth Hoy, a spokesperson for the NYCC.\n\nThe investigation evoked various disputes in the academic and social environments. Melissa Murray, a professor of law at U.C. Berkeley who is currently teaching at New York University, criticized the commission's interest in The Wing: \"I think it's patently absurd for New York's human rights commission to be focusing on The Wing when we've had, over the last six months, numerous complaints about workplaces being absolutely hostile to women in terms of pervasive and endemic sexual harassment.\" Craig Gurian, the executive director of the Anti-Discrimination Center in New York, however, offered a defense of New York City's public accommodations law: \"To the extent that there are workplaces or public accommodations that have inappropriate behavior, the solution is to fix those workplaces or public accommodations. Separate is not equal. We were supposed to learn that a very long time ago.\n\nNew York City Commission on Human Rights tweeted on March 27, 2018, responding to The Wing members' personal tweets defending their safe space: \"In NYC, no one should be discriminated against or harassed because of their gender. @NYCCHR uses every resource at our disposal to hold violators accountable and get justice for victims. Last yr, we increased fines & damages collected by more than $1 mil, collecting $2.7 million.\"\n\n"}
