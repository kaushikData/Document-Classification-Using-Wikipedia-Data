{"id": "864291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=864291", "title": "Brendan Bracken", "text": "Brendan Bracken\n\nBrendan Rendall Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken, PC (15 February 1901 – 8 August 1958) was an Irish-born businessman and a minister in the British Conservative cabinet. He is best remembered for opposing the Bank of England's co-operation with Adolf Hitler, and for subsequently supporting Winston Churchill's prosecution of World War II against Hitler. He was also the founder of the modern version of the \"Financial Times\". He served as Minister of Information from 1941 to 1945.\n\nBrendan Rendall Bracken was born in Templemore, County Tipperary, Ireland, the second son and third of the four children of Joseph Kevin Bracken (1852–1904), builder and monumental mason, and his second wife, Hannah Agnes Ryan (1872–1928). His father had belonged to the IRB and was one of the seven founders of the GAA.\n\nWidowed in 1904, by 1908 Hannah Bracken had moved her family (including two stepdaughters) to Dublin, where Brendan attended St Patrick's National School, Drumcondra, until 1910, when he was transferred to the O'Connell School, run by the Irish Christian Brothers. Distressed by his misbehaviour, his mother sent him in 1915 to Mungret College, a Jesuit boarding school in County Limerick, but he bolted in 1915 and ran up hotel bills. She then sent him to Australia to live with a cousin who was a priest in Echuca, Victoria. The young man led a nomadic existence in Australia, moving often but reading avidly and acquiring a self-education.\n\nIn 1919 Bracken returned briefly to Ireland, finding his mother settled in County Meath. He distanced himself from Ireland and his siblings who were in revolt over their father's inheritance, moving instead to settle in Liverpool. In 1920 he appeared at Sedbergh School in the West Riding of Yorkshire, claiming to be 15 years old, an Australian, to have been orphaned in a bush fire, and to have a family connection to Montagu Rendell, the then-headmaster of Winchester College. Without fully believing this story, Sedbergh's headmaster, impressed by the depth of knowledge and eagerness to progress by the young Bracken, accepted him. By the end of one term he emerged having succeeded in blending his Irish republican heritage and his five formative years in Australia, with the elements and trappings of a British public school man. He might have had good reason for seeking to hide his Irish heritage as the War of Independence (1919–1921) aroused great hostility towards the Irish living in Great Britain.\n\nFor whatever reason this denial became a regular feature of his personal strategy in life. A second example occurred in 1926 when he met Major-General Emmet Dalton, a former senior commander in the new Irish Army, in London. This former British Army officer turned IRA confidant, who was one of General Michael Collins's right-hand men, recalled meeting Bracken at national school in Dublin. Bracken denied this, but Dalton insisted that he remembered the smell of Bracken's corduroy trousers. A third example occurred during the Second World War when Bracken told people that his brother had been killed in action at Narvik, when in fact his brother was alive, well, and asking Brendan for money, from Ireland. \n\nAfter Sedbergh, whose \"old boy\" tie he used to good effect, Bracken was briefly a schoolmaster at Bishop's Stortford College. He then made a successful career from 1922 as a magazine publisher and newspaper editor in London. His initial success was based on selling advertising space to at least cover the cost of each number. In the 1923 election he assisted Winston Churchill's unsuccessful attempt to be elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester West, which started their political affiliation. He also assisted in \nthe by-election at Westmister. In the fighting that occurred on the streets, Bracken was stabbed. Bracken himself stood for Parliament, being elected to the House of Commons in 1929 for the London constituency of North Paddington. Stanley Baldwin described Bracken as Churchill's \"faithful chela\", \"chela\" being the Hindi word for disciple.\n\nMany of his early magazine stories included a political flavour and he commissioned articles from a wide range of politicians such as Churchill and Mussolini. Business and politics permanently overlapped in his life, in a similar way to the career of his occasional friend Lord Beaverbrook. He needed politicians for stories and they needed the publicity given by his publications. A supporter of Winston Churchill from 1923, when Churchill was out of Parliament and in the political wilderness, in the 1930s he was invited to join Churchill's \"Other Club\". Their lives changed from the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.\n\nIn 1926, he was the founding editor of \"The Banker\" magazine and bankers still name their respected annual Bank of the Year awards \"Brackens\" in his honour. \"The Banker\" features a regular column called \"Bracken\", focusing on providing views and perspectives on how to improve the global financial system.\n\nIn two matters relating to Churchill, Bracken can be said to have played a key part behind the scenes. When Neville Chamberlain prepared to resign in May 1940, his successor would be Churchill or Lord Halifax. The political issue at stake at the time was the formation of a British National Government, and the particular dilemma over which of Chamberlain's potential successors would be acceptable to the Labour Party. The view in Churchill's mind was that the Labour Party would not support him, and he had therefore agreed with Chamberlain to nominate Lord Halifax. When Bracken became aware of Churchill's agreement to nominate Lord Halifax, he convinced Churchill that the Labour Party would indeed support him as Chamberlain's successor, and that Lord Halifax's appointment would hand certain victory to Hitler. Bracken advised Churchill tactically to say nothing when the three met to arrange the succession. After a deafening silence during which Churchill was expected to nominate Halifax, the latter obligingly ruled himself out and Churchill was put forward as Britain's wartime Prime Minister, having avoided any appearance of disloyalty to Chamberlain.\n\nWhen Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940, Bracken helped in moving him into Downing Street. Bracken was sworn into the Privy Council in 1940, despite his lack of ministerial experience, and became Churchill's parliamentary private secretary.\n\nAn insight into the nature of the relationship between Churchill and Bracken is found in Churchill's history of World War II. Churchill writes that he had received telegrams from Washington about Harry Hopkins, \"stating that he was the closest confidant and personal agent of the President. I therefore arranged that he should be met by Mr. Brendan Bracken on his arrival.\" The suggestion was that Churchill had arranged, as is diplomatic custom, for Hopkins to be met by the person who was his closest counterpart in British government, and that Bracken often played the role of confidant and personal agent to Churchill. After Bracken met Hopkins' flight on 9 January 1941, Churchill and Hopkins forged a close association. According to Lysaght's biography, Bracken and Hopkins had met in America in the late 1930s, and this personal tie helped speed the decision to assist Britain nearly a year before the US actually entered the war.\n\nIn 1941, Bracken was promoted to the post of Minister of Information where he served until 1945. At the same time he was one of the heads of the Political Warfare Executive.\n\nIn 1945, after the break-up of the wartime coalition, Bracken was briefly made First Lord of the Admiralty in the Churchill caretaker ministry, but lost the post in the fall of the Churchill government to Clement Attlee's Labour Party. He himself lost his North Paddington seat but soon returned to the Commons, as member of parliament for Bournemouth in a November 1945 by-election. He was a relentless critic of the Labour Government's policy of nationalisation and the retreat from Empire. At the 1950 general election he was returned for Bournemouth East and Christchurch, a seat he held until the general election the following year. In early 1952 he was elevated to the peerage as Viscount Bracken, of Christchurch in the County of Southampton, but never used the title nor sat in the House of Lords. He retired from publishing in 1956.\n\nHis best-known business accomplishment was merging the \"Financial News\" into the \"Financial Times\" in 1945. The latter was published from Bracken House, London, clad in pink stone to match the colour of the paper, just east of St. Paul's Cathedral, which was remodelled in 1989. At this stage he was also publishing \"The Economist\". In 1951, with his love of history, he helped found \"History Today\" magazine.\n\nBracken died of esophageal cancer on 8 August 1958, aged 57, in London. Although raised a Catholic, he refused the last rites of the Church despite efforts by his nephew, Rev Kevin Bracken, a Cistercian monk at Bethlehem Abbey, Portglenone, County Antrim, to persuade him.\n\nHe was cremated without ceremony at Golders Green Crematorium. His being unmarried, the viscountcy died with him.\n\nOn 21 December 2010, RTÉ One broadcast an hour-long TV documentary about his life entitled \"Brendan Bracken – Churchill's Irishman\". The programme was made by Spanish production company, Marbella Productions, in association with RTÉ, and examined Bracken's life through photographs, interviews, rare archive footage and dramatic reconstructions, and told of his importance in the areas of British political and journalistic life, despite his attempt to hide from history by having all his papers burned after his death.\n\nThe 2015 television documentary \"Churchill's Secret Son\" is the 90 minute version of the previous documentary \"Churchill's Irishman\", updated by the producers including additional images, stories about Bracken's life and additional footage. The programme was telecast on Discovery UK's History Channel on Saturday, 24 January 2015 at 10 pm, as part of the British History week, and coincided with the 50th anniversary of Churchill's death in 1965.\n\n\n"}

However, due to the political crisis in Ukraine, Canada is seeking to suspend all sales to Moscow as part of its move to implement sanctions in support of Ukraine.\n\nIn 1986, Project Ploughshares organised a protest against the conference \"HiTech '86\" which was hosted by the Canadian government, advertising potential foreign markets to military-based contractors.\n\nIn 1991, the Canadian government amended the Exports and Imports Permit Act, to allow more freedom in selling LAVs and automatic weapons. Because it had recently been banned from Ottawa city property, the Arms Exhibition ARMX'91 moved to a new home at the Carp Airport outside the city limits.\n\nIn 1992, the Official Opposition Liberal Party introduced a Parliamentary proposal entitled \"Defence Conversion – A Liberal Priority\", which outlined three possibilities for a post-Cold War Canadian arms trade, including \"\"increas[ing] exports to developing countries where arms spending has been less affected by the Cold War's end – thereby adding to the misery of these countries.\", and instead advocating the third option, to \"encourage Canadian defence companies to adjust and move away from a dependence on military production and export.\".\n\nIn 1994, Canadian arms sales skyrocketed 48% to a total of $497.4 million, causing a brief controversy. This sharp escalation contributed to Canada's position as the 7th largest supplier of military arms to Third World countries. Large sales included GM-built Light Armoured Vehicles to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Air Defense Anti-Tank Systems and a Tactical Air Navigation System to Thailand.\n\n1994 also saw Canada begin selling military arms to Algeria, Colombia, Indonesia and South Africa.\n\nIn 1995, Canada became the 7th-largest supplier of arms to third-world countries, and the 10th largest arms dealer overall.\n\nIn 2000, Canada's sales totalled $434 million, across 50 nations. Large sales included eight Howitzers to Brazil, and four more LAVs to Saudi Arabia, while smaller sales included $4.9 million worth of rockets to Malaysia, $270,976 in simulator parts to Morocco, $50,000 worth of aircraft parts to Indonesia, $27,000 in small arms to Argentina, $21,400 worth of missile parts to Egypt.\n\nThe year also marked the conclusion of the Canadian sale of 40 Huey military helicopters to the United States, who then refitted 33 of the craft with further military upgrades and sold them to Colombia, thus allowing Canada to bypass its restriction against selling arms to Colombia.\n\nFrom 1991 through 2001, the Filipino Department of National Defense imported an annual average of $1.6 million worth of its equipment from Canada, including aircraft parts and service pistols. This was roughly 0.2% of the $995 million Filipino defense budget of 1998.\n\nMajor sales in 2004 included the sale of $346 million worth of Bell Helicopters to Pakistan and $22 million worth of Pratt & Whitney Canada aircraft engines to Indonesia.\n\nCanada jumped from fifteenth to twelfth largest exporter of military hardware in the world.\n\nCanada sold their military equipment to the Philippines in their signed Memorandum of Understanding agreement.\n\nOn December 14, 2012, the Government of Canada concluded the regulatory process to amend the AFCCL.

{"id": "323090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323090", "title": "Centralisation", "text": "Centralisation\n\nCentralisation (British) or centralization (both British and American) is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, become concentrated within a particular geographical location group. This moves the important decision-making and planning powers within the center of the organisation.\n\nThe term has a variety of meanings in several fields. In political science, centralisation refers to the concentration of a government's power—both geographically and politically—into a centralized government.\n\n\"Centralisation of authority\" is defined as the systematic and consistent concentration of authority at a central point or in a person within the organization. This idea was first introduced in the Qin Dynasty of China. The Qin government was highly bureaucratic and was administered by a hierarchy of officials, all serving the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huang. The Qin Dynasty practised all the things that Han Feizi taught, allowing Qin Shi Huang to own and control all his territories, including those conquered from other countries. Zheng and his advisers ended feudalism in China by setting up new laws and regulations under a centralized and bureaucratic government with a rigid centralization of authority. Under this system, both the military and government thrived. This was because talented individuals were more easily identified and picked out to be trained for specialized functions.\n\n\nThe acts for the implementation are needed after delegation. Therefore, the authority for taking the decisions can be spread with the help of the delegation of the authority.\n\nThe centralisation of authority can be done immediately, if complete concentration is given at the decision-making stage for any position. The centralisation can be done with a position or at a level in an organisation. Ideally, the decision-making power is held by a few individuals.\n\nCentralisation of authority has several advantages and disadvantages. The benefits include:\n\n\nDisadvantages, on the other hand are as follows:\n\n\nAs written in V.I. Lenin’s book, \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\", \"The remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism.\" He researched the development of production and decided to develop the concept of production as a centralised framework, from individual and scattered small workshops into large factories, leading the capitalism to the world. This is guided by the idea that once concentration of production develops into a particular level, it will become a monopoly, like party organisations of Cartel, Syndicate, and Trust.\n\nMost businesses deal with issues relating to the specifics of centralization or decentralization of decision-making. The key question is either whether the authority should manage all the things at the centre of a business (centralised), or whether it should be delegated far away from the centre (decentralised).\n\nThe choice between centralised or decentralised varies. Many large businesses necessarily involve some extent of decentralisation and some extent of centralisation when it begins to operate from several places or any new units and markets added.\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1984 by Charles and David Koch of Koch Industries. Ron Paul was appointed as the first chairman of the organization. The CSE described itself as \"hundreds of thousands of grassroots citizens dedicated to (1) free markets and limited government, and (2) the highest level of personal involvement in public policy activism.\"\n\nIn 2002, the CSE designed its tea party movement website, though the movement did not take off until 2009. In 2003, Dick Armey became the chairman of CSE after retiring from Congress. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. Both organizations played key roles in the Tea party movement beginning in 2009.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1990, the Koch family foundations the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation, and the Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation granted a combined $4.8 million to the CSE.\n\nThe CSE was one of several organizations that was connected with non-profit organizations that the tobacco industry and other corporate interests worked with and provided funding for after the 1971 Powell Memorandum. The CSE was mainly funded by the tobacco, oil, energy and sugar industries, including Phillip Morris, General Electric, and Exxon. Other contributors included Microsoft and Hertz. The CSE \"received almost $5 million from various Koch foundations between 1986 and 1990, and David Koch and several Koch Industries employees serve[d] as directors of CSE and the CSE Foundation.\"\n\nCSE briefly assumed control of the financially troubled Tax Foundation and operated it as a subsidiary from CSE's offices until the split in 2000. Beginning in 1990, the Tax Foundation \"operate[d] as a separate unit\" of Citizens for a Sound Economy. By July 1991, the Tax Foundation was again operating as \"an independent 501(c)(3) organization\".\nOpenSecrets.org has no contributions listed to CSE after 2000, when it received a total of about $35,000, and zero contributions in 1998.\n\nIn 2002, CSE designed and made public a \"tea party\" website. The website stated \"our US Tea Party is a national event, hosted continuously online and open to all Americans who feel our taxes are too high and the tax code is too complicated\". In 2003, Dick Armey became the chairman of CSE after retiring from Congress.\n\nIn 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity, according to the British newspaper \"The Guardian\". Dick Armey stayed as chairman of FreedomWorks, while David Koch stayed as chairman of Americans for Prosperity.\n\nOn July 23, 2006, \"The Washington Post\" reported on the organization's tactics in signing up as members people who did not know about the organization, by enrolling them as members during unrelated insurance transactions in order to boost membership numbers. The group obtained about $638,000 and 16,000 members through the sale of insurance policies in this way, according to the report. When someone signed up for insurance through \"Medical Savings Insurance Company\", they were also automatically signed up for Citizens for a Sound Economy without their knowledge, the report asserted. Their information is subject to be rented out as the Medical Savings Insurance Company deemed fit, which is not uncommon for many groups who obtain client contact information. Critics suggested the effort as a way for this group to inflate their membership rosters, and more exactly, by taking dues from people with no interest in the groups' politics.\n\nThe group produced more than 100 policy papers each year in its run, delivering them to many congressional offices, sending out thousands of pieces of mail, and getting coverage of its viewpoints in thousands of news articles around the United States. The group's representatives appeared on hundreds of radio and television shows and published hundreds op-ed articles arguing that \"environmental conservation requires a commonsense approach that limits the scope of government,\" acid rain is a \"so-called threat [that] is largely nonexistent,\" and global warming is \"a verdict in search of evidence.\"\n\nAccording to the conservative magazine Weekly Standard, CSE's greatest political success came in 1993 when it opposed Bill Clinton's proposal for a BTU energy tax. In addition to fighting tobacco taxes and healthcare reform, the CSE was a member organization of the Cooler Heads Coalition.\n\nOregon Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused in 2004 of encouraging George W.

Similar to how a person might apply for an internship with a business prior to applying for a full-time position, this temporary fellowship allows a person to experience non-profit work first-hand without the long-term commitment of a full-time encore career.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a distinct and growing trend among late-career or retired private-sector employees toward encore careers, or careers in the second half of life in social purpose or non-profit organizations. However, despite the growing popularity of the program, many who would otherwise be either interested in encore careers—either as an encore careerist or as an organization seeking to hire an encore careerist—are unable or unwilling to take part in the movement, often lacking experience, information, or communication between the corporate and the social sectors.\n\nIn 2009, a pilot program centered around using temporary fellowships as a means to reduce the difficulties inherent in transitioning between mid-life and encore careers emerged. The Silicon Valley Encore Fellows Program experimented with ten encore fellows, each of whom having formerly worked in high-level positions in various corporate departments, working for six to 12 months in community non-profit organizations. The fellows worked either part- or full-time for a stipend.

{"id": "203163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203163", "title": "Fugazi", "text": "Fugazi\n\nFugazi (; ) is an American punk rock band that formed in Washington, D.C. in 1987. The band consists of guitarists and vocalists Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto, bassist Joe Lally and drummer Brendan Canty.\n\nFugazi are noted for their unique sound, blending of elements of dub/reggae with high energy rock and punk/hardcore-styled guitars, as well as for their business practices and contempt towards the music industry. The band, and others from the punk and hardcore scene leading up to the early 1990s, were among the early adopters of what grew to be known as the DIY ethic.\n\nFugazi have performed numerous worldwide tours, produced six studio albums, a film and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world. Fugazi has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003.\n\nAfter the hardcore punk group Minor Threat dissolved, Ian MacKaye (vocals and guitar) was active with a few short-lived groups, most notably Embrace. MacKaye decided he wanted a project that was \"like The Stooges with reggae\", but was wary about forming another band after Embrace's break up. MacKaye recalled, \"My interests were not necessarily to be in a band, but to be with people who wanted to play music with me.\"\n\nMacKaye recruited ex-Dag Nasty drummer Colin Sears and bass guitarist Joe Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After a few months of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty (earlier of Rites of Spring). One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate Guy Picciotto dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that there seemed to be no place for him.\n\nAfter some uncertainty from Canty about what he wanted to do with his future, the trio regrouped and booked their first show at the Wilson Center in early September 1987. The group still needed a name, so MacKaye chose the word \"fugazi\" from Mark Baker's \"Nam\", a compilation of stories of Vietnam War veterans, it there being a slang acronym for \"Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In [into a body bag]\".\n\nThe band began inviting Picciotto to practices. Inspired by use of a foil in hip hop, Picciotto sang backup vocals. After his band Happy Go Licky broke up, he became more involved with Fugazi. MacKaye eventually asked Picciotto to become a full member, which he accepted.\n\nFugazi embarked on its first tour in January 1988. In June 1988 the band recorded its debut EP \"Fugazi\" with producer Ted Niceley and producer/engineer Don Zientara (who would become a long-time collaborator), and shortly afterwards embarked on an arduous tour of Europe.\n\nAt the tour's conclusion in December, the band recorded songs for its intended debut album. However, the band was spent from touring and decided that the resulting sessions were unsatisfactory. The track list was cut down to an EP and released as \"Margin Walker\" the following year. Both EPs were eventually combined into the \"13 Songs\" release in late 1989. Upon the band's return from Europe, Picciotto, unsatisfied with singing, began playing guitar too.\n\nWith Picciotto playing guitar full-time, Fugazi made the transition into jamming and writing new material as a band as opposed to performing songs composed solely by MacKaye. In addition to working on new material, songs they had been performing live were refined, such as \"Merchandise\" and \"Turnover\", for inclusion on their first official full-length studio album.\n\nReleased on April 19, 1990, through Dischord Records, \"Repeater\" did not initially reach the \"Billboard\" 200 charts or become a commercial success. However, the band spent most of 1990 and 1991 touring heavily behind \"Repeater\", performing a total of 250 concerts between March 1990 and June 1991, routinely selling out 1,000-plus capacity venues throughout the world. By summer 1991, the album sold more than 300,000 copies, a large number for a label that relied on minimal promotion. While major labels began to court Fugazi, the band decided to stay with Dischord and refused the offers of those labels. \"Repeater\" ultimately went on to sell more than 1 million copies in the U.S. alone, and more than 2 million worldwide. The album was critically well received and featured an alternative rock sound that pre-dated significant releases such as Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" and Pearl Jam's \"Ten\", which would unexpectedly go on to break the genre into the mainstream.\n\nFor Fugazi's second studio-album \"Steady Diet of Nothing\", released in July 1991, the band once again asked Ted Niceley to produce. Niceley had become a chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band members decided to produce the record themselves. After the success of \"Repeater\" and its subsequent world tour, \"Steady Diet\" was highly anticipated, six months prior to its release Dischord had pre-orders in excess of 160,000 for the album.\n\nFugazi recorded its third album \"In on the Kill Taker\" in the fall of 1992 with Steve Albini in Chicago; however, the results were deemed unsatisfactory and the band re-recorded the album with Ted Niceley & Don Zientara. With the breakthrough of alternative rock in the early 1990s, \"In on the Kill Taker\"; released on June 30, 1993, became the group's first record to enter the \"Billboard\" album charts, received critical praise from \"Spin\", \"TIME magazine\" and \"Rolling Stone\", sold 180,000 copies in its first week of release and subsequently became the band's breakthrough album.\n\nBy the \"In on the Kill Taker\" tour, the group began to sell-out large auditoriums and arenas, as well as receive more lucrative major label offers. During the band's sold-out 3-night stint at New York City's Roseland Ballroom in September 1993, music mogul and Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegün met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them. Ertegün offered the band \"anything you want\", their own subsidiary label and more than $10 million just to sign with Atlantic. Fugazi declined the offer. The organizers of Lollapalooza also attempted to recruit the band for a headlining slot on its 1993 tour, which the band considered but ultimately turned down.\nFugazi began writing the material for \"Red Medicine\" in late 1994, after touring in support of \"In on the Kill Taker\". The band worked with engineer Don Zientara, but did not choose to work with producer Ted Niceley again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of \"In on the Kill Taker\" and instead worked to create an ambient sound which would display greater range and depth. To achieve this, the band handled production duties themselves, and in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. \"Red Medicine\" would take Fugazi a step further toward art rock. The band began an extensive worldwide tour in support of the album, playing a total of 172 shows between March 1995 and November 1996.\n\nAfter the grueling worldwide tour the band had completed in support of \"Red Medicine\", Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow up release. By March 1997 Fugazi had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with producer/engineer Don Zientara to begin recording what would become the \"End Hits\" album with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent 7 months recording the album. Due to the title, rumors began circulating at the time that it was to be their last release. Released on April 28, 1998 the album was commercially successful and marked one of the band's highest debuts yet on the \"Billboard\" charts. However, critical reaction to \"End Hits\" was mixed. Many critics praised the album's heavier tracks, while others questioned the inclusion of the group's longer, more experimental songs.\nFugazi began work on \"The Argument\" in 1999. This process saw the group taking more time than usual to write and demo material. Each member would bring his own individual riffs and ideas to the band, jam on them, and then begin piecing the songs together into various configurations before deciding on what would become the final versions. The album's recording sessions took place between January and April 2001 at Inner Ear Studios and Dischord House in Arlington, VA, located just outside Washington D.C. The band once again worked with producer/engineer Don Zientara. During the recording process a considerable amount of time was spent finalizing each song's production, in particular the album's drum tracks, in an effort to give it a unique feel. Drummer Brendan Canty explained to \"Modern Drummer\" that \"We recorded them all very differently in terms of the drum sounds. We used a lot of different cymbals, snares, and ways of miking.\"\n\n\"The Argument\" was released by Dischord Records on October 16, 2001, along with the EP Furniture + 2, almost 4 years after the release of \"End Hits\". The album was met with critical and commercial success entering the \"Billboard\" charts and selling over 170,000 copies in its first week of release. Arion Berger of \"Rolling Stone\" called the album \"bracing\" and \"intellectual\" and Chris True of \"AllMusic\" referred to the album as \"spine-tingling and ear-shattering all at once\" stating that, \"the band has raised the bar for themselves and others once again.\" He also noted that the album had \"touched on strange new territory.\" By this point Fugazi were on tour less frequently, due in large part to other professional and personal commitments, they performed only 32 shows in 2001 and 2002 respectively.\n\nFugazi went on what they have called an \"indefinite hiatus\" after the conclusion of their 2002 UK tour following 3 sold-out nights at the London Forum in England on November 2, 3, 4, 2002. The hiatus was brought on by the band members' insistence on spending more time with their families and to pursue other professional projects.\n\nSince Fugazi went on hiatus in 2003, rumors began circulating regarding a possible reunion, with some insinuating that the band may get back together to headline the Coachella Festival. While the band has confirmed that they have been offered large sums of money to reunite and headline festivals, such as Coachella, they have so far declined the offers.\n\nIn March 2011, MacKaye reiterated that Fugazi has \"been offered insane amounts of money to play reunions, but it’s not going to be money that brings us back together, we would only play music together if we wanted to play music together and time allowed it\".\n\nIn November 2011, when asked by \"The A.V. Club\" about the possibility of a reunion and a follow up to 2001's \"The Argument\", bassist Joe Lally stated that \"\"The Argument\" was a great record that we should try and top. It’ll take some time to come together and everything. To do that, we’d have to, the way the four of us are, we would take quite some time, I think, re-associating ourselves musically, and then just letting it come about naturally, because it would have to be a natural thing. So we’ll just see.\"\n\nIn August 2014, Dischord announced an official release for \"First Demo\", an album featuring 11 demo songs recorded in January 1988. The announcement included a preview of the demo for the Fugazi track \"Merchandise.\" The eleven-track album was released on November 18, 2014.\n\nMacKaye insists Fugazi is not, in fact, broken up. While he admits any future public performance will have to contend with various confounding factors, the members have occasionally played music together, privately, since their 2002 hiatus.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, in a new interview on Vish Khanna's Kreative Kontrol podcast, Fugazi bassist Joe Lally revealed that the band still occasionally gets together to play. Lally begins, “Yeah, when we’re all in D.C., we totally hang out together and talk and spend a lot of time laughing. We have a great time together, go out to dinner, and we’ll play some music together.” He then shoots down any hopes of a potential reunion: “There’s so much to try to look after to allow Fugazi to do anything, that we do not have the time to give it the respect that it deserves. So unfortunately, it is where it is.”\n\nIn the hiatus, the members undertook side projects, with MacKaye forming the duo The Evens with drummer and singer Amy Farina (formerly of the Warmers).\n\nIn 2004, MacKaye produced the \"DC EP\" for former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante, which also featured Jerry Busher.\n\nCanty has been doing a variety of soundtrack scores and playing bass in the trio Garland Of Hours alongside frequent Fugazi guest contributors Jerry Busher and Amy Domingues, and has played bass live with Mary Timony. Canty also appears on Bob Mould's 2005 album \"Body of Song\" and on Mould's 2008 album \"District Line\", and has toured with Mould, appearing in the live DVD \"Circle of Friends\". He is currently working in the Burn to Shine DVD series which is being released by Trixie DVD. Now, he is playing in Deathfix alongside Devin Ocampo (Medications, Faraquet, Smart Went Crazy, Beauty Pill), Rich Morel (Bob Mould, Blow Off) and Mark Cisneros (Medications, The Make-Up). They will release their album in February 2013 on Dischord Records.\n\nLally has released three solo albums, \"There to Here\" (2006), \"Nothing Is Underrated\" (2007), and \"Why Should I Get Used To It\" (2011). He has also appeared on fellow DC post-punkers Decahedron's debut album \"Disconnection_Imminent\", as well as on a project with Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarists John Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer, known as Ataxia. The group has recorded two albums, \"Automatic Writing\" (2004) and \"AW II\" (2007).\n\nPicciotto currently works as a record producer most notably with Blonde Redhead and The Blood Brothers, and he has performed alongside members of The Ex at the Jazz festival in Wels, Austria. Picciotto also contributed guitar on two Vic Chesnutt albums, 2007's \"North Star Deserter and 2009's \"At the Cut\" (co-producing the latter), for Constellation Records and performed live with Chesnutt and members of Thee Silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra and The Quavers in Jem Cohen's program entitled, \"Evening's Civil Twilight in Empires of Tin at the Vienna International Film Festival (Viennale) in 2007 (a DVD of the program was released in 2009). Picciotto played guitar on Chesnutt's Fall/Winter 2009 North American Tour. He has a daughter with musician Kathi Wilcox from the band Bikini Kill and The Frumpies.\n\nIn July 2011, Minneapolis based record label Doomtree released an album of mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the Wu-Tang Clan. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself did not have any involvement with the release. Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated \"I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it. I mean, it’s enjoyable, and I do appreciate it for the fact that somebody enjoys our music enough to bring it into that. But, you know, I don’t know. I guess I should shut up, because I suppose I'm about to run into these people at the Fun Fun Fun Fest festival and talk to them. But I’m afraid that is my opinion on it. It's like, get better samples of our stuff, do better work.\"\n\nIn October 2012, Chris Lawhorn released \"Fugazi Edits\". The album includes 22 instrumental tracks, which sample 100 songs from Fugazi's discography. As in other cases, the band had no involvement in the production. But, the album was authorized for release by MacKaye, with the proceeds going to charity.\n\nIn 2016, Canty and Lally joined with guitarist Anthony Pirog to form the Messthetics, Canty and Lally's first project together since Fugazi's hiatus.\nIn March 2018, the Messthetics released their self-titled debut album and embarked upon a tour of the US and Japan.\n\nBetween 1987 and 2003, Fugazi played over 1000 concerts in all 50 US states and all over the world. Over 800 of these shows were recorded by the band's sound engineers. Beginning in 2004 and continuing into 2005, Fugazi launched a 30 CD Live Series that featured concerts from various points in their career, which were made available for sale via Dischord Records. Continuing with the live series concept and after several years of development on December 1, 2011 Fugazi launched a comprehensive Live Series website through Dischord Records that features 750 recordings available for download at the suggested price of $5 each or a \"pay what you want\" sliding scale option for each download between $1–100 with the goal of eventually making all 800 of the shows that have been recorded available for purchase. For $500 fans can also purchase an \"All Access\" privilege which will include access to any future concerts and downloads added to the site.\n\nWhile each concert was professionally mastered, the recordings capture everything that happened onstage and for preservation's sake the band chose not to edit anything out, singer/guitarist Guy Picciotto explained to the \"New York Times\", \"We liked this idea of, 'Let's just let it be everything,' ... There doesn't have to be the idea that this is the great, golden document. It's all there, and it's not cleaned up. You get what you get.\" The sound quality also varies as the earliest recordings were made to cassettes, then eventually digital formats such as DAT, CD-R and ultimately hard-drives were used. Each concert page also includes flyers, photographs and ticket stubs. As a career-spanning archival project, the Fugazi Live Series has few equals, putting the band in the company of acts like the Grateful Dead, Phish and Pearl Jam, three notable examples of other artists with such a large volume of concerts available for purchase.\n\nFugazi's style has been described as post-hardcore, art punk, alternative rock, indie rock and experimental rock. Fugazi's music was an intentional departure from that of the hardcore punk bands the members had played in previously. Fugazi combined punk with funk and reggae beats, irregular stop-start song structures, and heavy riffs inspired by popular rock bands such as Led Zeppelin and Queen, bands that the punk community of the time largely disdained.\n\nPicciotto became the group's second guitarist when he realized MacKaye's typically chunky, low-end riffs and Lally's dub-influenced basslines allowed him to focus on high-pitched parts. In both vocal and guitar roles, Picciotto assumed the role of a foil to MacKaye; employing a Rickenbacker guitar for its scratchy single-coil sound in order to \"cut through MacKaye's chunky chording like a laser beam.\" Picciotto's assumption of guitar duties allowed all four members of the band to jam together and write songs that way, where previously they had played songs largely as MacKaye had arranged them. When writing songs, the band often rearranges them with different structures and different singers. \"Spin Magazine\" has listed MacKaye and Picciotto together at No. 86 on their list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time for their unique and interlocking guitar style in Fugazi.\n\nGenerally, MacKaye's lyrics and singing are more direct and anthemic (MacKaye admits that he loves audience sing-alongs and writes songs with shout-able slogans), while Picciotto usually favors a more abstract, oblique approach. Lally has contributed vocals to a few songs as well, in which he sings in a more relaxed, quiet style as opposed to MacKaye and Picciotto, whose lyrics and vocals often feature strong emotional intensity. Later, Fugazi more fully integrated elements of punk rock, hardcore, soul and noise with an inventively syncopated rhythm section. Notable is MacKaye and Picciotto's inventive, interlocking guitar playing, which often defies the traditional notion of \"lead\" and \"rhythm\" guitars. They often feature unusual and dissonant chords and progressions filtered through a hardcore punk lens.\n\nWhen questioned by \"Guitar World\" in 2002 about the band's influences, singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye responded, \"Too many to mention. And not just from the last few years. Some of them predate us by decades, and most of them wouldn't be punk. I would hope any musician would be inspired by a lot of different kinds of music.\"\n\nJoe Strummer (the lead vocalist of the Clash) recognized Fugazi as the only band who best exemplified punk's spirit in the 2000 Rolling Stone interview.\n\nEach of Fugazi's albums since \"Repeater\" have featured an instrumental song. By the time of 1995's \"Red Medicine\" bassist Joe Lally also began contributing vocals to the band and the group was implementing many of their broader influences into the overall sound. Critics Ian McCaleb and Ira Robbins declared that Fugazi's music combined an \"unprecedented dynamic range ... and previously unimagined elements\" such as \"clattering musique concrète ... piano and sound effects ... murky dub and lancing clarinet\" and \"loose-limbed jammy funk ... into an ambitious, experimental format that raises more stylistic questions than it answers.\"\n\nBands who have cited Fugazi as an influence include Nirvana, Refused, At the Drive-In, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Quicksand, Deftones, Iceage, NOFX, Redención 911, Bad Religion, Blink-182, Rage Against the Machine, the Offspring, Bikini Kill, Lorde, and Pearl Jam.\n\nOn their first tours, Fugazi worked out its DIY ethic by trial and error. The group's decisions were partly motivated by pragmatic considerations that were essentially a punk rock version of simple living: for example, selling merchandise on tour would require a full-time merchandise salesperson who would require lodging, food, and other costs, so Fugazi decided to simplify their touring by not selling merchandise. The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to price gouging a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.\n\nIn later years and at many venues, particularly on the east and west coasts of the U.S., Fugazi was unable to get ticket prices below about $10–$15 total. However, it never saw the $5 rule as inviolable, instead aiming to charge a price that was both affordable and profitable. Unlike some similar, independent rock contemporaries, Fugazi's performances and tours were always profitable, due to the group's popularity, low business overhead costs, and MacKaye's keen sense of audience response in given regions.\n\nFugazi's early tours earned it a strong word-of-mouth reputation, both for its powerful performances, and also for the band's eagerness to play in unusual venues. The group sought out alternatives to traditional rock clubs partly to relieve the boredom of touring, but also hoping to show fans that there are other options to traditional ways of doing things. As Picciotto said, \"You find the Elks Lodge, you find the guy who's got a space in the back of his pizzeria, you find the guy who has a gallery. Kids will do that stuff because they want to make stuff happen.\"\n\nThe group (MacKaye in particular) also made a point of discouraging violent, unwanted slam dancing and fistfights, which it saw as relics of the late 1970s/early 1980s hardcore punk era. Michael Azerrad quotes Mackaye, \"See, [slam dancers] have one form of communication: violence ... So to disorient them, you don't give them violence. I'd say, 'Excuse me, sir...'- I mean, it \"freaks\" them out – 'Excuse me, sir, would you please cut that crap out?'\" Azerrad writes, \"[MacKaye's] admonitions seemed preachy to some. And by and large, people would obey – it wasn't cool to disrespect Ian MacKaye.\" Occasionally, Fugazi would have an unrepentant slam-dancer escorted from the concert, and give them an envelope containing a $5 refund (the group kept a stock of such envelopes in their tour van for these occasions).\n\nDuring the summer of 1990 MacKaye formed the corporation Lunar Atrocities Ltd. in order to shield his own and his bandmates' personal assets from the threat of lawsuits. As MacKaye's financial advisor, Seth Martin, explained to the \"Washington Post\" in a 1993 interview: \"protection from liability is the main reason to form a corporation, and for these guys it makes sense. If someone got hurt stage-diving and decided to sue, it would be harder to go after their personal assets.\"\n\nCurrent\n\nFormer\n\nTouring musicians\n\nTimeline\n\nStudio albums\n\n\n"}

He was the second of Benjamin and Catherine (née Flickinger) Firestone's three sons; Benjamin had a son and a daughter by his first wife. The original farm was disassembled and moved to Greenfield Village, a historical site founded by Henry Ford, in 1983 as part of a larger outdoor museum.\n\nFirestone's paternal great-great-great-grandfather, Hans Nicholas Feuerstein, immigrated from Berg, Bas-Rhin, France, in 1753, and settled in Pennsylvania. Three of Nicholas' sons – including Harvey's great-great-grandfather, Johan Nicholas – changed their surname to \"Firestone\", the English translation of the family's German name \"Feuerstein\".\n\nOn November 20, 1895, Firestone married Idabelle Smith. They eventually had seven children. Notable great-grandchildren include: Andrew Firestone, Nick Firestone, and William Clay Ford, Jr. (the son of Henry Ford's grandson and Harvey and Idabelle's granddaughter Martha).\n\nAfter graduating from Columbiana High School, Firestone worked for the Columbus Buggy Company in Columbus, Ohio before starting his own company in 1890, making rubber tires for carriages. In 1900 he soon saw the huge potential for marketing tires for automobiles and then founded the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, a pioneer in the mass production of tires. In 1926 he published a book, \"Men and Rubber: The Story of Business\", which was written in collaboration with Samuel Crowther.\n\nIn 1938, Firestone died of coronary thrombosis.\n\nFirestone, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison were generally considered the three leaders in American industry at the time, and often worked and vacationed together.

Founded in 1936 as the School of Industrial Art, the school moved to 1075 Second Avenue in 1960 and more recently, its Midtown Manhattan location on 56th Street, between Second and Third Avenues, in September 2012. High School of Art and Design is operated by the New York City Department of Education.\n\nOn November 8, 1936, four art teachers began what was to become the High School of Art and Design, the School of Industrial Art, in a former Manhattan elementary school at 257 West 40th Street, which for a time had housed a WPA Federal Theatre Project locale. Initially, they used orange crates and plywood to make storage and desks. One of the co-founders, John B. Kenny, became principal in 1941. The school soon moved to a building on East 79th Street in the Upper East Side, the former annex to the Benjamin Franklin High School. In September 1960, the school changed its name to the High School of Art and Design and moved to 1075 Second Avenue in east Midtown.\n\nThe 1936 school was first envisioned as a continuation school, that is, a school where children who had left school and gotten jobs attended for half days to continue their education, normally including vocational classes relevant to their current or possible future jobs. However, it opened as a vocational high school,\n\nOn November 8, 2004, a rally was scheduled on the occasion of the school's 68th anniversary. This was to include a press conference at which increased support of the school would be urged. On November 8, 2006 the school celebrated its 70th anniversary. The office of the Mayor of New York City issued a proclamation making November 8 \"High School of Art and Design Day\".\n\nApplicants must take an entrance exam and present a portfolio to be accepted. Freshmen sample all art and design subjects before selecting a major for their sophomore, junior and senior years. Students at Art and Design receive two periods of art instruction per day, choosing from among eight art majors: cartooning, animation, architecture, graphic design, illustration, fashion, photography, and film/video.\n\nArt and Design's Kenny Gallery, named for the school's founding principal John B. Kenny, hosts monthly art exhibits of student work. The gallery is open to the public. The Black Box Theatre was donated by the Friends of Art and Design (FAD).\n\nSome members of the school's faculty became notable for their creative work outside teaching. These include:\n\n"}

An expert-in-residence at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, he is the co-founder of Work-Bench, an early stage enterprise technology venture fund.\n\nVan Vuuren was born in Pretoria, South Africa. In 2003, Van Vuuren began undergraduate studies at Harvard, and graduated with a BA in economics in 2007. He earned a master's degree in design studies from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2012.\n\nWhile pursuing his postgraduate degree, Van Vuuren was awarded fellowships by the MIT Media Lab, TED and Pop Tech. He was a graduate student fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University from September 2010 through May 2012, and a scholar at the Aspen Institute in 2011.\n\nAt Harvard, Van Vuuren worked closely on art and science experiments and startup projects with professor David Edwards, whom he had first encountered in 2007 as student in Edwards' \"Idea Translation\" class. In 2008, along with several others in the class, Van Vuuren co-developed off-grid microbial fuel cells for use in sub-Saharan Africa. The research and project was funded by private investors, the Harvard Institute for Global Health, MIT IDEAS Global Challenge, as well as a $200,000 Lighting Africa grant from the World Bank and a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Challenges Grant.\n\nIn 2009, Van Vuuren worked with Edwards to establish ArtScience Labs (also known as the Laboratory at Harvard). An interdisciplinary platform for idea experimentation and exhibition in the arts and sciences, it was modeled after Le Laboratoire, an experimental art and design center in Paris. Van Vuuren served as the lab's director from its 2009 launch until 2012.\n\nBased on the growing ecosystem of startups at Harvard, and demonstrated in part by the success of the Lab, the Experiment Fund was founded in January 2012. A seed-stage investment fund co-founded and led by Van Vuuren, it was established specifically to support student start-ups and technologies and platforms created in Cambridge (or by people educated in Cambridge). The Experiment Fund was backed by Breyer Capital, Accel Partners, Polaris Partners, Harvard University, and NEA. Patrick Chung and Harry Weller, both NEA partners, were co-founders of the fund, as were Polaris' Alan Crane, and Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital. Edwards served as an advisor. The company's early investments included Kensho, Philo (formerly Tivli), Zumper, and Rest Devices, among others.\n\nIn 2014 Van Vuuren partnered with Chung to create Xfund. Focused on \"technically gifted entrepreneurs with a liberal arts mindset,\" Van Vuuren left the company after a high-profile dispute with Chung. Chung filed a lawsuit, and Van Vuuren countersued. The suit was settled privately in 2016.\n\nWith Thomas Quinlan, the president and chief executive of RR Donnelly & Sons Company and Jonathan Lehr, a veteran of Morgan Stanley, Van Vuuren founded Work-Bench Ventures in early 2012. A New York-based enterprise technology VC fund, Work-Bench has invested in APX Labs, DialPad (formerly Switch), True Office, VTS, X.ai, and vArmour, among others.\n"}

It replaced the putting out system, where contractors worked in their own facilities. Inside contracting was the system favored by the Springfield and Harper's Ferry Armories. Since the manufacturing system developed in the armories also became popular (the American system of manufacturing), manufacturers in the early 19th century tended to hire people trained in the armories as managers. They brought with them the practice of inside contracting.\n\nThe manufacturer hired inside contractors and provided materials and machinery. Each inside contractor was expected to hire his own employees and meet certain production and quality goals, but everything else was left to him. As a result, the system rewarded ingenuity, but also rewarded local optimization. For example, it was to the inside contractor's benefit to allow machinery to deteriorate toward the end of his contract since maintenance was costly and he might not reap the long-term benefit if he didn't get another contract. The system was eventually replaced with the factory system, in which everyone was an employee of the manufacturer directly.\n\n"}

Among these are Quantum Global Group, an international investment group with a particular focus on Africa and Banco Kwanza Invest, Angola’s first investment bank.\n\nJean-Claude Bastos de Morais was born on October 28, 1967 in Fribourg, Switzerland. He is of bi-national heritage. His father is from Angola and his mother is Swiss, coming from an entrepreneurial family. His maternal grandfather was an industrialist in the watch industry and invented the light inside the watch. According to Bastos, his late Angolan grandmother inspired him to establish the African Innovation Foundation in 2009.\n\nBastos studied economics at the University of Fribourg and received a Master of Arts in Management. He financed his studies by starting a regional mergers and acquisitions business that sold small companies. In 1989, Bastos joined Deloitte as a consultant and later Abegglen Management Partners. In 1995, he founded a venture capital company focused on Swiss SMEs.\n\nIn 2007, Bastos de Morais founded Quantum Global Group. He is Quantum's current Chief Executive Officer. In 2008, Bastos de Morais founded Banco Kwanza Invest, Angola's first investment bank.\n\nIn 2015 he launched the hybrid innovation hub, Fábrica de Sabão (The Soap Factory) to support innovation projects in Angola. The hub is a collaboration with the government, which leases it its premises. Fábrica de Sabão was built as an inclusive model to enable marginalized communities to participate in sustainable enterprise such as urban manufacturing.\n\nIn 2017, Bastos de Morais was elected an international council member, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\n\nIn 2009, he founded the African Innovation Foundation (AIF) which aims to support sustainable projects in Africa. The Foundation's Innovation Prize for Africa (IPA) was launched in 2011 in cooperation with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). In 2016 the Innovation Prize for Africa celebrated its 5th anniversary, and the AIF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for cooperation to support African innovators. In February 2017 the AIF signed a MoU with the Botswana Innovation Hub to support innovations in Botswana. In addition to the IPA, the AIF founded the ZuaHub, a platform that connects innovators with resources. By 2017 the IPA had a database of over 6000 innovators from 51 African countries.\n\nThe AIF also initiated the \"African Law Library\" (ALL). The project was launched on 28 November 2013 at the African Union's headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. With ALL Bastos implemented his idea of an online portal offering access to a wide range of legal documents as well as law and governance texts from African countries. The Huffington Post reported that 'in June 2014 alone, more than 10,000 research sessions were initiated on the African Law Library platform'. In March 2015 over 4500 regional and national court cases, 3600 legislative acts and 8000 secondary sources from eight African countries were published online.\n\nIn October 2011 Bastos founded the Kitangana Tennis Project for orphans in Angola. In 2017, his Quantum Global Group sponsored the Muhr Awards for Arab films at the Dubai International Film Festival. In addition, Bastos supports several Universities. He sponsors a research project at the Center of Neuroscience ZNZ, a collaboration between the University of Zurich and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH. He also serves on the advisory board of the Event Letterari Monte Verita Festival, the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) and the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business.\n\nIn 2011 he was convicted together with his partner by a criminal court in Switzerland for \"repeated qualified criminal mismanagement\". Both have illegally paid out money in an investment company under their control, which partly lined their own pockets. In 2017 the conviction played a major role in public discussions of his business activities which were uncovered by journalists in the Paradise Papers.\n\nIn November 2017 the BBC News reported about him in relation to the Paradise Papers. The Paradise Papers reported his use of Angola's sovereign wealth fund for his own investment projects. After the Paradise Papers were leaked licenses of seven funds of Bastos' Quantum Global were suspended on Mauritius after a visit of Angolan officials. The Mauritius Supreme Court froze 519 million USD on 58 bank accounts of Quantum Global in early April 2018. In London a British court froze 3 billion USD on Quantum Global accounts at the end of April 2018.\n\nAt the end of July 2018 the freezing of British bank accounts was lifted by London's High Court. It ruled, that the freezing was based on false information. The court accused the state funds representatives of \"breaches of the duty of disclosure\" in the fund's application for a freezing and called this breaches \"substantial\" and \"culpable\".\n\nIn September 2018 Bastos was arrested in Angola. Quantum Global accused Angola of coercion and intimidation to forces Bastos to surrender assets.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13460705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13460705", "title": "Julius Meinl V", "text": "Julius Meinl V\n\nJulius Meinl V (born 9 July 1959) is a British businessman, resident in Prague Czech Republic (since end of August 2013). He heads a substantial family business which was originally built upon the production and retailing of food products, and which was founded by his great-great-grandfather, Julius Meinl I, in Vienna in 1862.\n\nJulius Meinl V was born in Vienna, Austria to a wealthy family. To prepare him to join the family business, he was educated at the \"Ecole des Hautes Etudes Economiques, Juridiques et Sociales\", St Gallen, one of the world's leading business schools. He then gained experience in London with Swiss Bank Corporation and later in the United States with Brown Brothers Harriman, America's oldest and largest private bank. As a boy, Meinl V went to school in Austria, before finishing a degree in banking in Switzerland at the University of St. Gallen.\n\nThe Julius Meinl name is synonymous with the family business, and the brand is one of the most well known and prestigious in Austria. The family fortunes were built initially upon the manufacture and sale of quality ground coffee. From this beginning the company grew steadily and successfully, retailing an increasingly wide variety of foods. Over time it become the upmarket grocery multiple, with outlets throughout Austria and in many other Central and Eastern European countries. It also became one of Austria's largest companies.\n\nIn 1938, Meinl V's grandfather Julius Meinl III (1903–1991) was forced to leave Austria along with his Jewish wife and their son Meinl IV, while the rest of the Meinl family remained in Austria. Meinl V's mother's family also fled Austria, just managing to escape in 1940. Meinl III took his family to Britain. For this \"act of treachery\" the German government revoked the citizenship of the Meinl family, denouncing them as \"enemies of the Reich\". Meinl family became naturalised British citizens in 1946.\n\nDuring the course of World War II, Meinl III was in close contact with the authorities in Britain, providing advice and assistance on the manner in which the Nazi Party had extended its influence on Central Europe through the infiltration of the management of large retail organisations. After the war, Julius Meinl III assisted the Central Commission for Germany and Austria in the process of denazification of Austria. Meinl's contribution involved the identification of significant Nazi sympathisers who were occupying positions of authority in Austria and who had remained undetected. This work merely added to the growing list of those within Austria with a distaste for the name, Meinl.\n\nNevertheless, the family returned to Austria to begin the task of rebuilding the family business, which they did with considerable success, expanding the range of its retail operations throughout central Europe. It also ventured into banking, building a simple savings business into a small private bank.\n\nAfter graduating from university in banking, he spent two years in London with Swiss Bank Corporation and a further two years in New York at Brown Brothers Harriman, New York; America's oldest and largest private bank.\n\nIn 1983, at the age of 24, Meinl V assumed the reins of the Meinl Bank. In the early 1990s, Julius Meinl AG reestablished food-retail operations in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, where it had historically already been present. In 1998/99, the company implemented the divestiture of the food-retailing assets of Julius Meinl AG in Austria and Hungary, following which the group's activities became focused primarily on banking and finance operations. At this time, the activities of Meinl Bank were expanded, covering private and institutional asset management, private banking, and fund management. Meinl Bank became one of the leading Austrian private merchant and investment banks. In 2000, a subsidiary named Meinl Capital Markets was opened in London to provide broking services specialising in hedge funds and exchange traded funds. However, this operation was closed down in 2001. Also in 2001, the subsidiary Meinl Capital Advisors AG was founded to provide corporate finance and investment banking advisory services to governments and private clients.\n\nIn 1998, a Central European and Eastern European real-estate company was launched. It was introduced on the Vienna Stock Exchange in 2002 under the name Meinl European Land. In 2007, Meinl Airports International and Meinl International Power, specialised airport and energy investment funds, were additionally listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The Group's main area of activity is Central and Eastern Europe. Meinl V was not a director of any of the three funds. Also in 2007, after a controversial repurchase of certificates by Meinl European Land, the name \"Meinl\" appeared in the Austrian media on a negative basis.\n\nOn 17 January 2014 Julius Meinl was elected new President of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress (EAJC), a sub-organization of the World Jewish Congress (WJC) in Jerusalem. For Meinl the main priority in this function is to fight against anti-semitism. In his function as President of the EAJC Meinl is also a member of the Steering Committee of the JWC. .\n\nIn 2008, an investigation was commenced in Austria into the collapse in value of shares in Meinl European Land Limited. The same year, a parallel investigation was commenced in Jersey, in the Channel Islands, Meinl European Land being a Jersey company.\nOn 1 April 2009, a judge ordered Meinl V to be arrested following an interrogation by Vienna prosecutors. Meinl, who was at that time suspected of involvement in yet-to-be defined wrongdoing, was required to post bail of 100 million euros, because the judge considered him a flight risk due to his holding a British passport. Meinl remains uncharged with any offence.\n\nIn February 2012, the Jersey Financial Services Commission announced that it had closed its investigation into the affairs of Meinl European Land, having found no evidence of wrongdoing.,\n\nFollowing a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Vienna, most of the record deposit – 90 million euros – was refunded in March 2013. From the perspective of Meinl Bank, the only logical conclusion after this step is to close the criminal proceedings against Meinl. . The previous investigations have lasted for more than five years until now (May 2013) and are still without any result. In the course of the proceedings documents were seized by means of police raids, and according to an article in the daily newspaper Die Presse those documents are an absolute mess that was allegedly inflicted by a surveyor.\n\nOn December 31, 2014 Meinl and four other elements of Meinl Bank were charged with dishonesty in relation to a 212 million euro dividend paid out by his private bank. All five defendants, including Julius Meinl, have raised objections to the indictment in due time. In these objections the defendants pointed out that they behaved lawfully and strongly criticized the state prosecutor of Vienna as well as the indictment. As announced on April 17, 2015, the Vienna Higher Regional Court (OLG Wien) upheld the oppositions and rejected the charges against Julius Meinl and other defendants.\n\nJulius Meinl V is married to Dr. Ariane Meinl since 2012; Mr. Meinl has a son, Julius VI who's married Norwegian-born Olivia Holten - Stolt Nielsen on 2016, 1 July.\n\n"}

It lasted from 2004 to 2009. Kimberly-Clark is the world’s largest manufacturer of tissue products, most notably the Kleenex brand. According to its annual environmental report, the company purchases over 3.1 million metric tonnes (3.4 million tons) of virgin fiber from logging companies annually. The Kleercut campaign claims that this fiber is derived from wood pulp from old growth forests. Kimberly-Clark claims that the forests in question are largely cut for timber. The Kleercut campaign claims that Kimberly-Clark support the clearcutting of such forests in Canada and the United States, including forests habitat for wolverine and threatened wildlife the woodland caribou. Kimberly-Clark has responded that many of its supplies are certified by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative or the Canadian Standards Association.\n\nThe campaign is asking Kimberly-Clark to:\n\n\nThe result: On August 5, 2009, Kimberly-Clark and Greenpeace held a joint press conference, where the company announced that it would source 40% of its paper fiber from recycled content or other sustainable sources – a 71% increase from 2007 levels. The demand created by Kimberly-Clark for sustainably logged fiber was greater than the supply, enabling the company to convince logging companies to change their practices.\n\nThe Kleercut website read as follows:\n5 August 2009: Kimberly-Clark releases new environmental policy.\n\nThe Kleercut campaign is over.\n\nCanada's precious Boreal Forest is better conserved today. So are ancient forests around the world.\n\nAt a joint news conference in Washington DC, Greenpeace and the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, the world’s largest tissue-product manufacturer, announced an historic agreement that will ensure greater protection and sustainable management of Canada's Boreal Forest and other ancient forests around the world. \n\nThe agreement also will stand out as a model for forest-products companies worldwide.\n\nThe Kleercut campaign was centered around a philosophy that an effective and engaged grassroots is needed for a successful campaign. The majority of grassroots activity pressuring aimed at Kimberly Clark occurred in Canada and the United States.\n\nAccording to Greenpeace the Kleercut campaign is \"one of the more successful online forest campaigns in recent Canadian history,\" gaining Greenpeace Canada \"1,000 new [email] sign-ups each month.\"\n\nPhil Radford of Greenpeace US oversaw the grassroots mobilization efforts on the campaign in the U.S. The campaign included sneaking into Kleenex commercial shoots, convincing twenty-two universities and colleges to take action such as cancelling contracts, recruiting 500 companies to boycott Kimberly Clark, over 1,000 protests of the company, mobilizing volunteers to put flyers in Kleenex boxes, and more.\n\nOne of the main demands to Kimberly-Clark and other large customers of Canadian logging companies operating in ancient forests is to turn to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), a performance based forest certification program supported by local communities, environmental organizations, aboriginal groups, and industry. Kimberly-Clark currently sources the majority of its pulp (near 3 million tons) from Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) certified logging operations.\n\nForest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification has been criticized as well. While the most common criticism is that FSC is overly political, for example in Australia's forest Minister Abetz said \"a limiting feature of the FSC is the involvement of environmental organisations, particularly WWF and Greenpeace. WWF and Greenpeace formed the FSC in 1994 as a vehicle to further their political objectives and to take control of forest management and its regulation away from Governments.\" . It has also been pointed out that: \"The largest certified clearcut in the world is on an FSC certified forest in Ontario.\" One organization critical of FSC is Greenwood Earth Alliance who point that FSC certified forest \"cover large industrial-scale operations involving massive clearcutting and even-aged management\" and that at least one FSC certified company operating in Canada \"engage in clearcutting, high-grading, even-aged management, overlogging, and very large scale destruction of habitat through industrial logging.\" \n\n"}

From these categories, screening separates a flow of material into grades, these grades are then either further processed to an intermediary product or a finished product. Additionally the machines can be categorised into moving screen and static screen machines, as well as by whether the screens are horizontal or inclined.\n\nThe mining and mineral processing industry uses screening for a variety of processing applications. For example, after mining the minerals, the material is transported to a primary crusher. Before crushing large boulder are scalped on a shaker with thick shielding screening. Further down stream after crushing the material can pass through screens with openings or slots that continue to become smaller. Finally, screening is used to make a final separation to produce saleable products based on a grade or a size range.\n\nA screening machine consist of a drive that induces vibration, a screen media that causes particle separation, and a deck which holds the screen media and the drive and is the mode of transport for the vibration.\n\nThere are physical factors that makes screening practical. For example, vibration, g force, bed density, and material shape all facilitate the rate or cut. Electrostatic forces can also hinder screening efficiency in way of water attraction causing sticking or plugging, or very dry material generate a charge that causes it to attract to the screen itself.\n\nAs with any industrial process there is a group of terms that identify and define what screening is. Terms like blinding, contamination, frequency, amplitude, and others describe the basic characteristics of screening, and those characteristics in turn shape the overall method of dry or wet screening.\n\nIn addition, the way a deck is vibrated differentiates screens. Different types of motion have their advantages and disadvantages. In addition media types also have their different properties that lead to advantages and disadvantages.\n\nFinally, there are issues and problems associated with screening. Screen tearing, contamination, blinding, and dampening all affect screening efficiency.\n\n\nLike any mechanical and physical entity there are scientific, industrial, and layman terminology. The following is a partial list of terms that are associated with mechanical screening.\n\nThere are a number of types of mechanical screening equipment that cause segregation. These types are based on the motion of the machine through its motor drive.\n\n\nAn improvement on vibration, vibratory, and linear screeners, a tumbler screener uses elliptical action which aids in screening of even very fine material. As like panning for gold, the fine particles tend to stay towards the center and the larger go to the outside. It allows for segregation and unloads the screen surface so that it can effectively do its job. With the addition of multiple decks and ball cleaning decks, even difficult products can be screened at high capacity to very fine separations.\n\nCircle-Throw Vibrating Equipment is a shaker or a series of shakers as to where the drive causes the whole structure to move. The structure extends to a maximum throw or length and then contracts to a base state. A pattern of springs are situated below the structure to where there is vibration and shock absorption as the structure returns to the base state.\n\nThis type of equipment is used for very large particles, sizes that range from pebble size on up to boulder size material. It is also designed for high volume output. As a scalper, this shaker will allow oversize material to pass over and fall into a crusher such a cone crusher, jaw crusher, or hammer mill. The material that passes the screen by-passes the crusher and is conveyed and combined with the crush material.\n\nAlso this equipment is used in washing processes, as material passes under spray bars, finer material and foreign material is washed through the screen. This is one example of wet screening.\n\nHigh frequency vibrating equipment is a shaker whose frame is fixed and the drive vibrates only the screen cloth. High frequency vibration equipment is for particles that are in this particle size range of an 1/8 in (3 mm) down to a +150 mesh.\n\nThese shakers usually make a secondary cut for further processing or make a finished product cut.\n\nThese shakers are usually set at a steep angle relative to the horizontal level plane. Angles range from 25 to 45 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.\nThis type of equipment has an eccentric drive or weights that causes the shaker to travel in an orbital path. The material rolls over the screen and falls with the induction of gravity and directional shifts. Rubber balls and trays provide an additional mechanical means to cause the material to fall through. The balls also provide a throwing action for the material to find an open slot to fall through.\n\nThe shaker is set a shallow angle relative to the horizontal level plane. Usually, no more than 2 to 5 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.\n\nThese types of shakers are used for very clean cuts. Generally, a final material cut will not contain any oversize or any fines contamination.\n\nThese shakers are designed for the highest attainable quality at the cost of a reduced feed rate.\n\nTrommel screens have a rotating drum on a shallow angle with screen panels around the diameter of the drum. The feed material always sits at the bottom of the drum and, as the drum rotates, always comes into contact with clean screen. The oversize travels to the end of the drum as it does not pass through the screen, while the undersize passes through the screen into a launder below.\n\nThere are many ways to install screen media into a screen box deck (shaker deck). Also, the type of attachment system has an influence on the dimensions of the media.\n\nTensioned screen cloth is typically 4 feet by the width or the length of the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned. Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted on both sides of the screen box. When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth. Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).\n\nCommonly, vibratory-type screening equipment employs rigid, circular sieve frames to which woven wire mesh is attached. Conventional methods of producing tensioned meshed screens has given way in recent years to bonding, whereby the mesh is no longer tensioned and trapped between a sieve frame body and clamping ring; instead, developments in modern adhesive technologies has allowed the industry to adopt high strength structural adhesives to bond tensioned mesh directly to frames.\n\nModular screen media is typically 1 foot large by 1 or 2 feet long (4 feet long for ISEPREN WS 85 ) steel reinforced polyurethane or rubber panels. They are installed on a flat deck (no crown) that normally has a larger surface than a tensioned deck. This larger surface design compensates for the fact that rubber and polyurethane modular screen media offers less open area than wire cloth. Over the years, numerous ways have been developed to attach modular panels to the screen deck stringers (girders). Some of these attachment systems have been or are currently patented. Self-cleaning screen media is also available on this modular system.\n\nThere are several types of screen media manufactured with different types of material that use the two common types of screen media attachment systems, tensioned and modular.\n\nWoven wire cloth, typically produced from stainless steel, is commonly employed as a filtration medium for sieving in a wide range of industries. Most often woven with a plain weave, or a twill weave for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A twill weave allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.\n\nToday wire cloth is woven to strict international standards, e.g. ISO1944:1999, which dictates acceptable tolerance regarding nominal mesh count and blemishes. The nominal mesh count, to which mesh is generally defined is a measure of the number of openings per lineal inch, determined by counting the number of openings from the centre of one wire to the centre of another wire one lineal inch away. For example, a 2 mesh woven with a wire of 1.6mm wire diameter has an aperture of 11.1mm (see picture below of a 2 mesh with an intermediate crimp). The formula for calculating the aperture of a mesh, with a known mesh count and wire diameter, is as follows:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere a = aperture, b = mesh count and c = wire diameter.\nOther calculations regarding woven wire cloth/mesh can be made including weight and open area determination. Of note, wire diameters are often referred to by their standard wire gauge (swg); e.g. a 1.6mm wire is a 16 swg.\n\nTraditionally, screen cloth was made with metal wires woven with a loom. Today, woven cloth is still widely used primarily because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life. Slotted opening woven cloth is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster than the rest of the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.\n\nOn a crushing and screening plant, punch plates or perforated plates are mostly used on scalper vibrating screens, after raw products pass on grizzly bars. Most likely installed on a tensioned deck, punch plates offer excellent wear life for high-impact and high material flow applications.\n\nSynthetic screen media is used where wear life is an issue. Large producers such as mines or huge quarries use them to reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact screen media material used on the top deck of a scalper screen. To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen panels, slotted opening panels and diamond opening panels. Due to the 7-degree demoulding angle, polyurethane screen media users can experience granulometry changes of product during the wear life of the panel.\n\nSelf-cleaning screen media was initially engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The idea was to place crimped wires side-by-side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires to be free to vibrate between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire. In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires). One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron. During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a “hybrid” self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires. In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook. Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver. They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be a direct result of the higher vibration frequency of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in hertz) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in RPM), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.\n"}

Led by the Council, the project will deliver 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs to Enfield, next door to the Lee Valley Regional Park. \n\nAlongside new homes, public spaces and community facilities, the development will have its own new railway station, unlocking the area for commuters with better connections south to Stratford and London Liverpool Street and north to Stansted and Cambridge.\n\nMeridian Water is being actively led by the Council, who is overseeing the vision for the project, which is based around three pillars, and its delivery:\n\n1.  Mixing uses and animating streets\n\n2.  Park life at your doorstep\n\n3.  Your place to make and create \n\nCurrently best known as the home of IKEA and Tesco, the 210-acre site is located in the south of the London Borough of Enfield between Edmonton, Tottenham and Walthamstow.\n\nThe site is also home to the Ravenside Retail park in the north and a number of large blue warehouse structures, formally owned by British Oxygen Company, or BOC Group, for the manufacture of liquified gas storage vessels. These buildings are currently being used for storage, industrial and distribution purposes.\n\nIt sits next door to the parklands and sports facilities of the 10,000 acre Lee Valley Regional Park, and benefits from the River Lee Navigation and the adjacent Pymmes Brook passing right through the site, providing the opportunity for a waterside living and working environment. \n\nThe Council has acquired 87 acres (35 hectares) of land at Meridian Water since April 2014. It currently owns 64% of all developable land within the red line boundary of the site and has to date committed £157m to land acquisition.\n\nMeridian One will see the first 725 homes and retail space built at Willoughby Lane. Outline planning permission was achieved in summer 2016 and enabling works are progressing while the procurement process for a development partner is underway through the Greater London Authority’s (GLA) London Development Panel. \n\nThese homes will be delivered around the brand new Meridian Water station, which is due to open in summer 2019 and serve up to four million passengers each year at its peak.  \n\nA planning application and development partner are also being progressed for Meridian Two at Leeside Road, which will deliver 200 affordable homes, earmarked for ‘makers and creators’ that will use new workspace on the lower floors. This will be complemented by a new employment hub for around 900 new jobs at a 2-3 acre site along the North Circular.\n\nMixing uses and animating streets\n\nMeridian Water will create a mixed-use community for the capital – where homes and public spaces are enlivened by a mix of growing industries and surrounding communities.\n\nThe 10,000 new mixed-tenure homes will support growth in Enfield and London and provide opportunity for everyone, at all stages of life and across all income scales.\n\nThe Council’s aim is to create a 24-hour neighbourhood – a new destination to enjoy nightlife, music, theatre, cinema and much more, all year round.\n\nThe area will be linked by a new boulevard, connecting the train station in the west to the Lee Valley Regional Park in the east, passing over the waterways and through a series of public spaces to create one cohesive neighbourhood.\n\nThe first new school opened in January 2017, with further investment into schools, health services, community facilities, parks, leisure and culture and transport infrastructure to come. \n\nPark life at your doorstep\n\nMeridian Water will be the greenest development in London with waterside-living, next door to the Lee Valley Regional Park. \n\nProgress is being made to bring open spaces to the area. A new green space is already open for local communities at Ladysmith Park – designed by local residents, groups and schools – with more to come. \n\nThe site has excellent road networks as it is bounded by the North Circular Road (A406), A10 and M11. Along with the new Meridian Water train station and super high-speed broadband, communities will be able to connect with the environment on their doorstep and beyond. \n\nThe Council will strive for the highest quality of design and environmental sustainability standards throughout the development. The new homes and businesses will be supplied by the Council’s own energy company, energetik, with low carbon heat through a series of community heat networks – reducing their carbon footprint for heating by 60%. \n\nYour place to make and create \n\nMeridian Water will create an economy for makers and creators, delivering new jobs and opportunities for local people on a scale which will transform the employment base of the Borough.\n\nThis will represent a step-change away from industrial warehousing and logistics type uses, which are relatively plentiful in the Borough, offering higher skilled, higher paid employment opportunities for local people.\n\nA new series of employment offers will be developed across the site, attracting major employers as well as start-ups, including new meanwhile uses, a new cluster for fashion manufacturing and the creation of workspaces for makers, creators and artists. \n\nLocal social-enterprise Building Bloqs, alongside ACAVA (Association for Cultural Advancement through Visual Art) and UKFT (the UK Fashion & Textile Association) will form part of the new employment hub at Meridian Water, providing a boost and new jobs for the ‘maker’ economy.\n\nThe Council will also work with a number of operators to deliver temporary projects across the site, making efficient use of land, creating short to medium-term employment opportunities and bringing life and activity to the area early on in the programme. This will include bringing the existing sheds back into use on the site by delivering high quality leisure, arts and culture facilities to support a 24-hour destination.\n\nThroughout the life of the overall regeneration programme, an estimated 10,000 construction jobs will be created. A dedicated training offering to provide a programme of traineeships and apprenticeships and an active schools programme will also be delivered, helping local people gain the skills needed during construction and beyond as well as inspiring the next generation of employees.\n\nAs a development planned from scratch, super high-speed broadband will be delivered across the site matched by a pioneering approach to digital infrastructure to maximise the benefits of the sharing economy.\n\n \n"}

In a 44-year career at McCann Erickson Worldwide (subsequently McCann Worldgroup), Moreira headed the agency’s InterNational Team—referred to by \"The New York Times\" as a \"daring experiment in the nascent science of worldwide marketing\"—customizing global campaigns to address cultural nuances on a country-by-country basis. Moreira has been credited with accelerating the cross-border, or \"trans-nationalization\", of brands.\n\nMoreira also served for 25 years as worldwide creative director on McCann’s biggest clients, including Coca-Cola, General Motors and Nestlé. His multi-cultural expertise attracted the attention of Secretary of State Colin Powell and his Under-Secretary Charlotte Beers, who personally recruited Moreira for a special communications program in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The project, codenamed \"Shared Values\", helped defuse fear and distrust of the U.S. among Muslim communities overseas and at home.\n\nMoreira is best known for his international work in the soft-drink marketplace, specifically on the Coca-Cola account for which Adweek labeled him the \"brigadier general\" of global advertising. He oversaw the design and implementation of \"Coke Is It\", a campaign that ran for five years in the U.S market and longer worldwide. He was also the creative leader on the international introduction of Diet Coke.\n\nIn 1985, he was one of the key creative executives helping Coca-Cola launch—and handle the subsequent fallout from – New Coke, the company's notorious mistake viewed as a surrender to Pepsi in the \"cola wars\". It led ultimately to the rebranding of the original formula as \"Coca-Cola Classic.\"\n\nMoreira has won more than 100 creative awards in the U.S. and around the world. In his native Brazil, he was named Advertising Professional of the Year, Decade and, in 2003, the Century.\n\nIn 1967, Moreira began his McCann career as a projectionist and assistant TV producer in Brazil. He was promoted to copywriter in 1969 and one year later to associate creative director. He relocated to the agency’s London office in 1971 and became head of a creative group there. He subsequently took writer-producer positions in Lisbon, Frankfurt and Copenhagen, before returning to Brazil where he advanced to creative director of Latin America.\n\nIn that post, he headed the General Motors account, particularly the launch of four Chevrolet models, including Opala – the first GM passenger car to be introduced in the Brazilian market.\n\nThe agency transferred Moreira to New York in 1980 where Phil Dougherty, advertising columnist for The New York Times, wrote that he was \"certainly a man to watch.\" Soon after, McCann consolidated its three regional creative units – EuroTeam, AsiaTeam and New York Team – into the InterNational Team. At the time, McCann had the industry’s most comprehensive global network, with 100 offices in 64 countries. The firm chose Moreira to head this initiative in 1984.\n\nWhen Moreira took over the InterNational team, it had been conceived as a \"firefighting\" unit, dedicated to helping affiliates around the world resolve problems, such as pitching new business or writing a critically needed spot for a short-handed office. Moreira enhanced the vision, approaching the initiative as an opportunity to change the \"brown envelope syndrome\" in global advertising, which he described as \"when something is created in New York and sent in a brown envelope to offices overseas with instructions to translate. \n\nHe was among the first to argue that much of American advertising was \"unexportable\". In a 1991 interview with \"Time\", he discussed the American cultural tendency toward the \"hard sell\" and \"wearing our feelings on our sleeve\" versus other world cultures that resist overt emotional manipulation. Alternately, he addressed in \"USA Today\" Americans' customary prudishness toward sexual content in advertising—despite their taste for \"titillation in entertainment\" - that would be incompatible with advertising in other parts of the world.\n\nMoreira advocated for centralized strategies and concepts, but localized execution that reflects cultural nuances. He often drew on the disparate ways customers around the world perceived product benefits. For example, as diet soda brands grew popular in the 80s, he explained:\n\n\"In the American market, if you say a diet drink is to help you keep in shape, it’s like saying a car has four wheels. To be successful, you have to offer that plus tremendous taste and heritage. Overseas, you have to bring to people’s attention that the time has come to look after themselves, and here’s a soft drink that will help [them] with that.\"\n\nYet he reinforced the importance of creating a universal brand experience that transcends culture, even though the execution may require nuanced expression. He described this careful balance using the simultaneous Coca Cola campaigns \"You Can’t Beat the Feeling\" and \"I Feel Coke\" that ran in the U.S. and Japan, respectively:\n\n\"Japan is probably the one country whose ads would strike you as having the most unique look due to the cultural and ethnic orientation of the advertising. If you forgot for a minute that those faces were Japanese faces, those people live in a Coca-Cola world. The sounds, words and images are actually quite similar to those you see here or in the U.K. or in Australia... They’re different interpretations of the same idea.\"\n\nMoreira ultimately held McCann posts in eight nations and insisted that team members have on-the-ground experience in the countries where they were helping develop and execute campaigns. He encouraged art directors, writers and producers involved in InterNational Team business to accept long-term overseas career opportunities rather than simply periodic travel. He also maintained that these opportunities needed to be symbiotic throughout the McCann network and not merely involve placement of experts from the New York headquarters around the globe:\n\n\"I don’t mean one-way streets, like Americans or Brits going to see the world; I see a two-way street in which other nationalities will come into these cultures and energize them in their own way.\"\n\nMoreira became an active spokesperson of the new global approach to marketing. He was often pursued for commentary by major business reporters and regularly published opinion pieces in relevant media. When Advertising Age ran a feature on global marketing as \"the new wave\", an American executive objected to the decision-making authority vested in \"some marketing director in Chile [who] is probably a bozo\". Moreira wrote a scathing response detailing the new realities of multi-cultural marketing and explaining, \"That ‘bozo’ is the global agency’s real client\", responsible not only for strategy but to profits, given that global work is paid for locally.\n\nIn 1989, Moreira was promoted to Vice Chairman/Chief Creative Officer, International, and later named Chief Creative Officer, McCann Worldgroup.\n\nIn the mid-90s, McCann Worldwide focused on the Far East, given the re-emergence of China as an economic leader, the rise of the middle class in such markets as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, and the region’s new sensitivity about cultural values in advertising. McCann named Moreira regional director. He oversaw strategic as well as creative development and helped revitalize McCann's Asia Pacific presence. He also transitioned the McCann Hong Kong office during the British handover to China, and assumed direct management of McCann Tokyo, the firm’s largest international office. Likewise, he played a critical role in securing the flagship Coca-Cola account in what had become a highly competitive region.\n\nIn 2000, Moreira was named McCann’s Vice Chairman, Global Professional Management of McCann Worldgroup responsible for all personnel handling global accounts - in addition to his international creative role. In 2003, he took his final role as Vice Chairman, Chief Talent Officer and Worldwide HR Director, responsible for worldwide recruitment and career development of thousands of employees.\n\nIn recognition of Moreira’s defining role in global marketing, Deutsche Bank featured him in its 2001 campaign \"New Destinations Call for New Maps\" that appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and a full range of international business publications.\n\nAmong his major industry awards, Moreira had won a Gold Lion for Coca-Cola, a Silver Lion for Bayer, three Clio Awards for Chevrolet and another for \"Coke Is It!\" He had been one of only three Americans to chair the International Advertising Film Festival in Cannes, France.\n\nMoreira retired from McCann in 2011.\n\nMoreira died June 18, 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts as a result of complications during heart surgery.\nHe is survived by his wife, Maria Moreira; daughter Eliana Moreira, son Joaquim Moreira, and grandson Lucas Moreira\n"}

{"id": "236093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236093", "title": "Pump and dump", "text": "Pump and dump\n\n\"Pump and dump\" (P&D) is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Once the operators of the scheme \"dump\" sell their overvalued shares, the price falls and investors lose their money. This is most common with small cap cryptocurrencies and very small corporations, i.e. \"microcaps\". See Microcap stock fraud.\n\nWhile fraudsters in the past relied on cold calls, the Internet now offers a cheaper and easier way of reaching large numbers of potential investors through spam email, bad data, social media, and false information.\n\nPump and dump schemes may take place on the Internet using an e-mail spam campaign, through media channels via a fake press release, or through telemarketing from \"boiler room\" brokerage houses (such as that dramatized in the 2000 film \"Boiler Room\"). Often the stock promoter will claim to have \"inside\" information about impending news. Newsletters may purport to offer unbiased recommendations, then tout a company as a \"hot\" stock, for their own benefit. Promoters may also post messages in chat rooms or stock message boards such as ADVFN, urging readers to buy the stock quickly.\n\nIf a promoter's campaign to \"pump\" a stock is successful, it will entice unwitting investors to purchase shares of the target company. The increased demand, price, and trading volume of the stock may convince more people to believe the hype, and to buy shares as well. When the promoters behind the scheme sell (dump) their shares and stop promoting the stock, the price plummets, and other investors are left holding a stock that is worth significantly less than they paid for it.\n\nFraudsters frequently use this ploy with small, thinly traded companies—known as \"penny stocks,\" generally traded over-the-counter (in the United States, this would mean markets such as the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets), rather than markets such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ—because it is easier to manipulate a stock when there is little or no independent information available about the company. The same principle applies in the United Kingdom, where target companies are typically small companies on the AIM or OFEX.\n\nA more modern spin on this attack is known as hack, pump and dump. In this form, a person purchases penny stocks and then uses compromised brokerage accounts to purchase large quantities of that stock. The net result is a price increase, which is often pushed further by day traders seeing a quick advance in a stock. The original stockholder then cashes out at a premium.\n\nIn the early 1990s the penny-stock brokerage Stratton Oakmont artificially inflated the price of owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Firm co-founder Jordan Belfort was criminally convicted for his role in the scheme. He later turned his story into a memoir, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", which was later adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film of the same name.\n\nDuring the dot-com era, when stock-market fever was at its height and many people spent significant amounts of time on stock Internet message boards, a 15-year-old named Jonathan Lebed showed how easy it was to use the Internet to run a successful pump and dump. Lebed bought penny stocks and then promoted them on message boards, pointing at the price increase. When other investors bought the stock, Lebed sold his for a profit, leaving the other investors holding the bag. He came to the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which filed a civil suit against him alleging security manipulation. Lebed settled the charges by paying a fraction of his total gains. He neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, but promised not to manipulate securities in the future.\n\nAs late as April 2001, before the company's collapse, Enron executives participated in an elaborate scheme of pump and dump, in addition to other illegal practices that fooled even the most experienced analysts on Wall Street. Studies of the anonymous messages posted on the Yahoo board dedicated to Enron revealed predictive messages that the company was basically a house of cards, and that investors should bail out while the stock was good. After Enron falsely reported profits which inflated the stock price, they covered the real numbers by using questionable accounting practices. Twenty-nine Enron executives sold overvalued stock for more than a billion dollars before the company went bankrupt.\n\nIn April 2007, the U.S. SEC brought charges against Park Financial Group as a result of an investigation into a pump and dump scheme during 2002–2003 of the Pink Sheet listed stock of Spear & Jackson Inc.\n\nStarted as Crown Corporation, Langbar was the biggest pump and dump fraud on the Alternative Investment Market, part of the London Stock Exchange. The company was at one point valued greater than $1 billion, based on supposed bank deposits in Brazil which did not exist. None of the chief conspirators were convicted, although their whereabouts are known. A patsy who made a negligent false statement about the assets was convicted and banned from being a director. The investors who lost as much as £100 million sued one of the fraudsters and recovered £30 million.\n\nPump and dump stock scams are prevalent in spam, accounting for about 15% of spam e-mail messages. A survey of 75,000 unsolicited emails sent between January 2004 and July 2005 concluded that spammers could make an average return of 4.29% by using this method, while recipients who act on the spam message typically lose close to 5.5% of their investment within two days. A study by Böhme and Holz shows a similar effect. Stocks targeted by spam are almost always penny stocks, selling for less than $5 per share, not traded on major exchanges, are thinly traded, and are difficult or impossible to sell short. Spammers acquire stock before sending the messages, and sell the day the message is sent.\n\nA pump and dump scam is a type of economic bubble, with the main difference between this scheme and most other types of bubbles being that the pump and dump bubble is deliberately perpetrated by unlawful activity. A pump and dump scheme is similar in many ways to a Ponzi scheme (in that both types of scam use misrepresentations in an effort to enrich the promoters and/or initial investors with money from later investors), however, there are a number of differences between the schemes:\n\nPump and dump differs from many other forms of spam (such as advance fee fraud emails and lottery scam messages) in that it does not require the recipient to contact the spammer to collect supposed \"winnings,\" or to transfer money from supposed bank accounts. This makes tracking the source of pump and dump spam difficult, and has also given rise to \"minimalist\" spam consisting of a small untraceable image file containing a picture of a stock symbol.\n\nA variant of the pump and dump scam, the \"short and distort\" works in the opposite manner. Instead of first buying the stock, and then artificially raising its price before selling, in a \"short and distort\" the scammer first short-sells the stock, and then artificially \"lowers\" the price, using the same techniques as the pump and dump but using criticism or negative predictions regarding the stock. The scammer then covers their short position when they buy back the stock at a lower price. This tactic is commonly used by institutions and brokers to dupe individual traders in the Korean stock market, as only institutional traders are allowed to shortsell stocks.\n\nOne method of regulating and restricting pump and dump manipulators is to target the category of stocks most often associated with this scheme. To that end, penny stocks have been the target of heightened enforcement efforts. In the United States, regulators have defined a penny stock as a security that must meet a number of specific standards. The criteria include price, market capitalization, and minimum shareholder equity. Securities traded on a national stock exchange, regardless of price, are exempt from regulatory designation as a penny stock, since it is thought that exchange traded securities are less vulnerable to manipulation. Therefore, Citigroup (NYSE:C) and other NYSE listed securities which traded below $1.00 during the market downturn of 2008–2009, while properly regarded as \"low priced\" securities, were not technically \"penny stocks\". Although penny stock trading in the United States is now primarily controlled through rules and regulations enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the genesis of this control is found in State securities law. The State of Georgia was the first state to codify a comprehensive penny stock securities law. Secretary of State Max Cleland, whose office enforced State securities laws was a principal proponent of the legislation. Representative Chesley V. Morton, the only stockbroker in the Georgia General Assembly at the time, was principal sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives. Georgia's penny stock law was subsequently challenged in court. However, the law was eventually upheld in U.S. District Court, and the statute became the template for laws enacted in other states. Shortly thereafter, both FINRA and the SEC enacted comprehensive revisions of their penny stock regulations. These regulations proved effective in either closing or greatly restricting broker/dealers, such as Blinder, Robinson & Company, which specialized in the penny stocks sector. Meyer Blinder was jailed for securities fraud in 1992, after the collapse of his firm. However, sanctions under these specific regulations lack an effective means to address pump and dump schemes perpetrated by unregistered groups and individuals.\n\n\n"}

His parents were Ojelabi Olapajuokun (who later took the name John Blaize) and Maria Blaize. At an early age, he attended a mission school and was nurtured in the Christian way. He started work as an apprentice for a printer in Freetown but soon left the country for the Lagos Colony in 1862.\n\nAfter arriving Lagos in 1862, Blaize worked as a printer for Robert Campbell, editor of Anglo-American. He then left printing for merchandise trading and importation. In trading, the participants were numerous, especially those from Lagos; most of the traders mainly dealt with exchanging goods with exporters and a few delved into exportation. A number of traders owned steamers, which were used to navigate the Niger River to buy goods from groups across river, and some even boasted they showed the imperialists how to move across the river. Blaize was among a few of the Lagos merchants to be very successful in trading; he was an importer and was also involved with trade across the Niger. Though the ruinous approach of competitors led to many indigenous enterprises foundling not the least helped with the dominance of sole proprietorships, Blaize thrived in the midst of strong competition and became one of the wealthiest West Africans of his time. He was included in the European Lagos Chamber of Commerce constituted in 1888 and was on the 1898 Commission on Trade in Lagos.\n\nHe was a prominent member of the Royal African Society during the second half of the nineteenth century. He was also at various times, a newspaper publisher. He entered the newsprint business in 1880, with the launch of \"The Lagos Times and Gold Coast Colony Advertiser\". The paper brought on Mr Mojola Agbebi, who later became prominent and known for his views on cultural Nationalism. However, the life of the newspaper was short, it folded in 1884. He was thereafter approached by John Payne Jackson, a Liberian emigrant who wanted to re-invent the Times. After much prodding, Blaize agreed to publish a new rag: the \"Lagos Weekly Times\". Through his newspapers, he took an active part in demanding more education, better representation for Africans in Lagos, self-government, and pushed for a separation of Lagos Colony from the Gold Coast Colony.\n\nBlaize's political clout in Lagos Colony was demonstrated in 1901 during the contest for the Lagos Throne. After Governor William MacGregor refused to accept any of the rival candidates (Oduntan and Ajose Dawudu) for the Obaship, one of the king-makers (Yesufu Omo-Oba) introduced Eshugbayi Eleko to Blaize, and Blaize in turn introduced Eshugbayi Eleko to Governor MacGregor, who recognized Eleko as Oba of Lagos.\n\nBlaize married Emily Cole in 1871 and the couple had 6 children including Charlotte Olajumoke, who in 1902, married Dr Orisadipe Obasa. Emily Cole died in 1895.\n\nIn the 1890s Blaize's financial worth was estimated to be about £150,000. Blaize donated £500 in memory of Mary Kingsley to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. When he died in 1904, he bequeathed £3,000 for the foundation of the Blaize Memorial Institute in Abeokuta, which opened in 1909 and functioned well into the 1970s. Blaize kept his connection with Freetown, his place of birth, bequeathing £500 to the Princess Christian Hospital there. Blaize left an estate valued at £60,000 to his children.\n"}

Risk assurance is very similar to assurance practices. One way to think about it is that the Assurance department in a firm is more broader and accounting based while the risk assurance department is a subset, much smaller and specific. Auditors that work in the risk assurance department are more focused on auditing Information Technology General Controls (ITGCs) and completing a System and Organization Control (SOC 1) reports. It has become a huge part of public accounting firms revenue as the industry trends show that firms and clients are moving towards making technology a huge part of their day to day services. This means risk assurance will become a huge part of their auditors work. It starts with a meeting between the client and auditor to discuss which processes of the client that the auditors will choose to audit. They decide this based off of which processes are significant and what controls are there in place to prevent any error or fraud. An example of this would be access into the journal entry database to ensure that anyone who has access is supposed to and those who do not cannot access the database.\n"}

His father Simon Ongpin is among those who migrated from mainland China to do business in the Philippine islands. Ongpin learned about doing business at a young age.\n\nOngpin established his own business in 1883 he dubbed as \"El 82\" after the cholera outbreak in the Philippine islands a year ago. The name was chosen as a symbol of rebirth of the archipelago from the health disaster. The business of Ongpin was a success, and his wealth and social standing improved. He pioneered the use of fixed pricing and double-entry accounting system. One of the exclusive products that El 82 sold was art supplies. Ongpin's wife Pascuala Domingo was a descendant of Filipino artist Damián Domingo. Through this, Ongpin got involved with the illustrados.\n\nOngpin is a financier of the Katipunan, letting the revolutionaries use his store as a secret hideout. Ongpin also provided financial aid and food to the revolutionary movement until the end of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. Ongpin once again aided the Filipinos following the Philippine-American War and was imprisoned by the Americans from December 1900 until March 1901.\n\nDespite attaining freedom from imprisonment, Ongpin remained opposed against the United States' occupation of the Philippines. He expressed this sentiment by refusing to sell his products to Americans and teaching his children to be self-sufficient without help from foreigners.\n\nOngpin also had civic involvements and held posts in organizations. He was the Teniente Primo de Mestizos, president of Casa Asilo de Invalidos Filipinos de Guerra an institution for veterans of Pascual Poblete, and treasurer of Union Obrera de Filipinas of Isabelo de los Reyes. He also had membership at the Philippine Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOngpin died on December 10, 1912, due to heart ailment. Before his death, he requested his family to dress his corpse with barong tagalog. He was interred at the North Cemetery of Manila.\n\nThe Calle Sacrista in Manila was renamed as Ongpin Street on September 17, 1915 and a monument of Ongpin was built at the Plaza de Binondo.\n"}

{"id": "12563807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12563807", "title": "Sidney Stanley", "text": "Sidney Stanley\n\nSidney (or Sydney) Stanley (\"né\" Solomon Wulkan, alias Solomon Koszyski, alias Stanley Rechtand, later Schlomo ben Chaim) (1899/1905 – 1969) was a Polish \"émigré\" to the UK who became a dubious businessman of precarious ethics before claiming to be a \"contact man\", able to influence politicians and civil servants in return for cash bribes, claims that led to a great scandal and investigation by the Lynskey tribunal of 1948. There is also evidence that Stanley spied against the UK for the armed nationalist activist Irgun organisation. Stanley was ordered deported, but had lost his Polish nationality, and as a result was a stateless person. Stanley was then placed under heavy restrictions and police surveillance. In 1949, he evaded police and fled to France and thence to Israel, where he was granted citizenship through right-of-return. There he lived out the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.\n\nStanley was the eldest son of twelve children born in Poland. He had emigrated to Britain with his father in 1913, the rest of the family following when the two had settled in Aldgate. He later said he was born in Oświęcim. He was granted a Polish passport in 1927. He gave a fairly ambiguous account of his early career but seems to have been employed from the age of 14 in garment sales and trading, especially in government contracts. He took his mother's name Koszyski.\n\nHe married his first wife Kate Zeitlin after World War I and the couple lived in Stoke Newington with Zeitlin's mother.\n\nStanley was made bankrupt in 1927, under the name Wulkan, and again in 1936, under the name Blotz. A deportation order was made against him in 1933 for conspiracy to defraud though he proved untraceable. However, by 1946, he had established himself in a luxurious seven-room apartment in Park Lane.\n\nAccording to Stanley, in 1946, he was returning by train from a business trip to Manchester when the guard enquired whether he would make up a foursome for a game of solo whist with some other men. He consequently met George Gibson, a director of the Bank of England. Gibson's account is that his party had asked Stanley for small change for their game and that Stanley had recognised Gibson through a common acquaintance, Cyril Ross.\n\nGibson met Stanley several more times on the Manchester train before, in April 1947, running into him in the company of Marcus Wulkan, an American who had been involved in economic assistance to Britain during World War II and who was slightly known to Gibson. Stanley represented Wulkan as being his brother. Gibson invited the two to dinner, where they now met junior government minister John Belcher, and after that Gibson visited Stanley's Park Lane home frequently. At a subsequent dinner party attended by Morgan Phillips and four other Labour MPs, Stanley became involved in raising finance for the anti-communist \"Freedom and Democracy\" organisation, though he appears to have done little more than donate a cheque for £50 which was dishonoured.\n\nIn October 1946, Stanley approached fur-dealer Cyril Ross, the common acquaintance from the Manchester train, with a business proposition. Ross said that he would be interested in a multiple store such as J. Jones of Manchester. Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for flotation as a public company from the Capital Issues Committee. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J. Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.\n\nIn February 1948, Gibson introduced Financial Secretary to the Treasury Glenvil Hall to Stanley, believing that Marcus Wulkan might be in a position to arrange an American loan of £250 million to the UK government. At a dinner for Gibson on 23 March, Stanley ensured that he sat next to Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin.\n\nBelcher was keen to network with industrialists and was flattered by Stanley's apparent solicitude. The two rapidly became friends and Stanley offered Belcher use of a house that he had rented at Margate for the duration of the 1947 Labour Party conference. Belcher took the opportunity to invite his wife, children and mother for a two-week vacation, and it soon became apparent to Stanley that the party was too large for his rented house. Stanley booked the party into a hotel in Cliftonville and, though Belcher at this point became nervous, Stanley insisted and prevailed. In the end, Belcher indulged himself thoroughly and the friendship between the pair became increasingly intimate.\n\nStanley pressed more and more gifts of food and wine, a gold cigarette-case and ultimately a suit of a quality beyond the means, and clothing coupons, of a junior minister in post-war Britain. Stanley was full of rather vague industrial and commercial propositions that never came to any resolution. Stanley also paid for suits for Gibson and Minister of Works Charles Key.\n\nSeveral people warned of Stanley's unreliability including Hugh Dalton, Leonard Joseph Matchan and Morgan Phillips.\n\nIn November 1947 an MI5 report recorded that a man named \"Stanley\" had been passing information to Irgun from cabinet minister Manny Shinwell. Shinwell certainly knew Stanley whom he had approached for help in finding employment for his son Ernie, and Stanley had obtained information on the disbandment of the Transjordan Frontier Force from some government source.\n\nHarry Sherman was a director of Shermans Pools Ltd of Cardiff, a football pools promoter. The post-war paper-shortage had led the government to make an allocation of paper to the Football Pool Promoters' Association and to leave the association to share it among its members. Sherman believed his share to be unjust and took every opportunity to canvass anyone who could influence his case or find him an alternative source. However, Sherman's record of complaints of his misconduct in a closely regulated industry led the Board of Trade to start a prosecution against the company in January 1948. The magistrate who heard the case died before giving judgment and Sherman and his legal team galvanised into action to prevent a new hearing. Belcher was the minister responsible and was inundated with protests. Stanley contacted Sherman sometime in May, claiming to have already discussed the paper problems with Sherman's brother.\n\nIn May, Stanley introduced Sherman to Gibson and to Glenvil Hall. Sherman sought a public flotation of Shermans Ltd but needed the permission of the Capital Issues Committee though neither politician was optimistic. Stanley also canvassed Key over some premises that he was attempting to sell to Sherman.\n\nOn 20 April, Stanley invited Belcher to stop by his Park Lane apartment. When he arrived he found Sherman. Belcher left angrily and later rebuked Stanley. Belcher decided to drop the prosecution against Sherman but the allocation of paper was now under his direct control and Sherman became still more insistent in seeking to increase his ration. Stanley continued to intercede on Sherman's behalf and Belcher agreed to meet with Sherman and the civil servant in charge of paper rationing on 24 June. At this meeting, Sherman revealed that he had been routinely exceeding his allocation. The government team were appalled and stopped the meeting indicating that they considered the matter a serious one and that an investigation would be inevitable.\n\nBefore the investigation could get under way, Sherman alleged that he had paid Stanley so that Stanley, in turn, could pay GBP2,500 each to Belcher and Sir Frank Soskice, the Solicitor General. Sherman also claimed that he had loaned GBP12,000 to Stanley, secured by a GBP27,000 cheque made out to Lass & Co. The cheque turned out to be a forgery, made out on a stolen blank cheque. Appalled, and becoming increasingly aware that rumours were beginning to circulate, Belcher tried to warn Gibson but could not contact him. Senior civil servants had now become aware of the allegations and the police were involved. Belcher agreed that the Lord Chancellor William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt should be alerted and asked to investigate. On 24 September, Belcher received a request from Jowitt that he provide a statement about his dealings with Stanley. On 4 October, the first rumours, though no names, appeared in the press.\n\nJacob Harris was a supplier of amusement machines whose solicitor also acted for Stanley. The solicitor had originally met Stanley through serving a bankruptcy notice on him and had ended up as his attorney. The original debtor never got paid. Stanley boasted of his surplus import licenses and the solicitor advised Harris whom he knew wanted to import pinball machines. In July 1948, Harris approached fellow supplier Francis Price with a proposal that they meet with Stanley. Stanley claimed that he could bribe Belcher and Financial Secretary to the Treasury Glenvil Hall to obtain licenses. After canvassing some commercial and political confidantes, Price contacted the police. Press speculation intensified.\n\nOn 27 August, Stanley asked Gibson to write letters of introduction for his wife, who was about to leave for the US, to some of Gibson's trade union colleagues there. Gibson complied and Stanley used the letters to attempt to obtain from HM Treasury foreign currency above the usual allowance. Stanley's approach alerted officials to the possibility that he was about to flee the country. 27 August was also the day when Gibson sent a cheque for GBP500 to Stanley as deposit on a share offer in Gray's Carpets Ltd. Gibson heard nothing more from Stanley.\n\nStanley was arrested on 18 October and held in Brixton Prison. Spartan though his surroundings were, he was able to order meals from a restaurant and pay another detainee for domestic duties. He was bailed on 21 October and returned to his Park Lane flat where his movements were restricted under the Aliens Order 1946.\n\nA tribunal was convened. Stanley, dapper in appearance, proved a self-important, self-aggrandising witness who amused the tribunal with his idiosyncratic, colourful, yet ambiguous and contradictory, responses to the questioning. The tribunal found that Belcher and Gibson had acted improperly and they were fortunate to escape prosecution, gladly accepting the proffered alternative of resignation. Attorney-General Sir Hartley Shawcross expressed the opinion that Stanley could not be prosecuted as the notoriety he gained from the tribunal would inhibit a fair trial. The spying allegations were not raised in the tribunal.\n\nOn 23 December, Stanley applied for cancellation of his deportation order but was refused. However, while Gibson and Belcher were resigning in disgrace, Stanley and his wife were enjoying their notoriety and celebrity, attending the Chelsea Arts Ball at New Year.\n\nIn a debate in the House of Commons on 3 February 1949, Prime Minister Clement Attlee expressed the government view that Stanley should be deported as the deportation would be \"conducive to the public good\". Attlee was probably principally motivated by the spying allegations and Stanley's Zionist connections.\n\nDespite the deportation order, the British government found that it could not deport Stanley, because no country was willing to receive him. He had lost citizenship in his home country of Poland, which was unwilling to take him in. Due to the changes in Poland's borders since World War II, the Polish government required all Polish citizens to re-register home and abroad. Stanley had not done so, and in addition, the Polish Foreign Ministry announced that he would not be allowed to return. As a result, Stanley was rendered a stateless person, and could not be deported unless his country of origin or some other country was willing to receive him.\n\nIn February 1949, Stanley applied for Israeli nationality. On 13 February, his application was rejected on the grounds that he was an undesirable. The Israeli newspaper \"Haaretz\" attacked Stanley as a Jew who \"suddenly discovered his love for Zion\" when in difficulties and there was speculation that Stanley had done his case no good when he criticised the conduct of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War during his tribunal testimony. Stanley continued to entertain and enjoy his celebrity, despite continued calls for his deportation, while he was again pursued by the bankruptcy courts. Stanley threatened to sue Israel for denying him entry, and empowered his lawyers in Israel to take action in court to get him an immigration visa. His lawyers in Israel argued that under the new state's proposed constitution, no Jew could be barred from immigrating to Israel.\n\nStanley was still required daily to report to police but reported for the last time on 1 April and an arrest warrant was issued. Stanley, it appears, drove to Ramsgate, where a personal friend took him by sea to a port near Boulogne in France, possibly Dunkirk. He was taken from there by car to Abbeville. On 13 April, Israel announced that it would accept Stanley's application for an immigration visa and admit him to the country on the eve of Passover as \"an act of grace and mercy\". After about a month in France, Stanley travelled to Marseilles, where he boarded the Israeli ship \"Atzmaut\". On 9 May, he arrived in Haifa aboard the \"Atzmaut\" together with about 2,000 other immigrants to Israel. He then held a press conference announcing that his name was now Shlomo Ben-Chaim. He made various claims regarding his disappearance, including that he had been kidnapped and held in France for a month, that he had escaped from Britain disguised as an admiral, and then as a military officer who became a passenger on a British destroyer. His lawyer, Max Seligman, said he was a \"psychological case\". Sometime later in 1949, Stanley returned to France with some thoughts of re-establishing himself in business, but moved back to Israel in 1950, where he spent the remainder of his life in obscurity, save for the wild allegations and stories that he continued to press on the newspapers. Stanley died in Tel Aviv in 1969.\n\n"}

{"id": "1550867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1550867", "title": "Term loan", "text": "Term loan\n\nA term loan is a monetary loan that is repaid in regular payments over a set period of time. Term loans usually last between one and ten years, but may last as long as 30 years in some cases. A term loan usually involves an unfixed interest rate that will add additional balance to be repaid.\n\nTerm loans can be given on an individual basis, but are often used for small business loans. The ability to repay over a long period of time is attractive for new or expanding enterprises, as the assumption is that they will increase their profit over time. Term loans are a good way of quickly increasing capital in order to raise a business’ supply capabilities or range. For instance, some new companies may use a term loan to buy company vehicles or rent more space for their operations.\n\nOne thing to consider when getting a term loan is whether the interest rate is fixed or floating. A fixed interest rate means that the percentage of interest will never increase, regardless of the financial market. Low-interest periods are usually an excellent time to take out a fixed rate loan. Floating interest rates will fluctuate with the market, which can be good or bad for you depending on what happens with the global and national economy. Since some term loans last for 10 years, betting that the rate will stay consistently low is a real risk.\n\nAlso, consider whether the term loan you are looking at uses compound interest. If it does, the amount of interest will be periodically added to the principal borrowed amount, meaning that the interest keeps getting higher the longer the term lasts. If the loan does use compound interest, check to see if there are any penalties for early repayment of the loan. If you get a windfall or profits increase spectacularly, you may be able to pay off your entire balance before it is due, preventing you from paying additional interest by waiting for the loan term to end.\n\nSome loaning institutions offer a variety of repayment plans for your term loan. Commonly, you may choose to pay off your debt in even amounts, or the amount you pay will gradually increase over the loan period. If you expect that you will be more financially able to repay in the future, causing an incremental increase may help you and save you interest. If you are unsure of your future monetary position, even payments may help prevent defaulting on the loan if things go badly.\n\nChoosing a term loan may be in your best interest, depending on your circumstances. Beware of extremely long repayment periods, as generally speaking, the longer the term, the more you will owe because the interest accrues over a long period of time. For more information, contact a financial advisor or speak to your bank about loan options they provide.\n"}
{"id": "45051881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45051881", "title": "The Big Short (film)", "text": "The Big Short (film)\n\nThe Big Short is a 2015 American biographical comedy-drama film directed by Adam McKay and written by McKay and Charles Randolph, based on the 2010 book \"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine\" by Michael Lewis about the financial crisis of 2007–2008 which was triggered by the United States housing bubble. The film stars Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, Melissa Leo, Hamish Linklater, John Magaro, Rafe Spall, Jeremy Strong, Finn Wittrock, and Marisa Tomei.\n\nThe film is noted for the unconventional techniques it employs to explain complex financial instruments. Among others, it features cameo appearances by actress Margot Robbie, chef Anthony Bourdain, singer-songwriter Selena Gomez, and economist Richard Thaler, who break the fourth wall to explain concepts such as subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations as a meta-reference. Several other actors directly address the audience, most frequently Gosling, who serves as the narrator.\n\nThe film began a limited release in the United States on December 11, 2015, followed by a wide release on December 23 by Paramount Pictures. The film was a commercial success, grossing $133 million against a $50 million budget. The film was also highly praised by critics, with many highlighting the cast's performances (particularly Bale, Carell and Gosling), McKay's direction and the screenplay. The film won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in addition to nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Bale), and Best Film Editing.\n\nThe film consists of three separate but concurrent stories, loosely connected by their actions in the years leading up to the 2007 housing market crash.\n\nMichael Burry\n\nIn 2005, eccentric hedge fund manager Michael Burry discovers that the United States housing market is extremely unstable, being based on high-risk subprime loans. Anticipating the market's collapse in Q2 2007, as interest rates would rise from adjustable-rate mortgages, he proposes to create a credit default swap market, allowing him to bet against market-based mortgage-backed securities, for profit.\n\nHis long-term bet, exceeding $1 billion, is accepted by major investment and commercial banks, but as it requires paying substantial monthly premiums, it sparks his clients' vocal unhappiness, believing he is \"wasting\" capital. Many demand that he reverse and sell, but Burry refuses. Under pressure, he eventually restricts withdrawals, angering investors. Eventually, the market collapses and his fund's value increases by 489% with an overall profit of over $2.69 billion.\n\nFrontPoint Partners and Jared Vennett\n\nDeutsche Bank salesman Jared Vennett is one of the first to understand Burry's analysis, learning from one of the bankers who sold Burry an early credit default swap. Using his quant to verify that Burry is likely correct, he decides to enter the market, earning a fee on selling the swaps to firms who will profit when the underlying bonds fail. A misplaced phone call alerts FrontPoint hedge fund manager Mark Baum, who is motivated to buy swaps from Vennett due to his low regard for banks' ethics and business models. FrontPoint begins buying swaps after a field investigation in South Florida. Vennett explains that the packaging of subprime loans into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) rated at AAA ratings will guarantee their eventual collapse.\n\nIn Florida the FrontPoint team discovers that mortgage brokers are profiting by selling their mortgage deals to Wall Street banks, who pay higher margins for the riskier mortgages, creating the bubble. In early 2007, as these loans begin to default, CDO prices somehow rise and ratings agencies refuse to downgrade the bond ratings. Baum discovers conflicts of interest and dishonesty amongst the credit rating agencies from an acquaintance at Standard & Poor's. Baum's employees question Vennett's motives, yet he maintains his position and invites Baum and company to the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas. Interviewed by Baum, CDO manager Wing Chau, on behalf of an investment bank, describes how synthetic CDOs create chains of increasingly large bets on faulty loans – up to 20 times as much money as the loans themselves. Baum horrifyingly realizes that the fraud will completely collapse the global economy. He purchases as much as possible, profiting at the banks' expense and waits until the last minute to sell. Baum's fund reaches $1 billion, and he laments that the banks won't accept blame for the crisis.\n\nBrownfield Capital\n\nYoung investors Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley accidentally discover a prospectus by Vennett, convincing them to invest in swaps, as it fits their strategy of buying cheap insurance with big potential payouts. Below the capital threshold for an ISDA Master Agreement required to enter into trades like Burry's and Baum's, they enlist the aid of retired securities trader Ben Rickert. When the bond values and CDOs rise despite defaults, Geller suspects the banks of committing fraud. The trio also visit the Forum, learning that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has no regulations to monitor mortgage-backed security activity. They successfully make even more profit than other hedge funds by shorting the higher-rated AA mortgage securities, as they were considered highly stable and carried a much higher payout ratio.\n\nGeller and Shipley are initially ecstatic, but Rickert is disgusted, citing the impending collapse and its effects; when unemployment goes up 1%, 40,000 people will die. Furthermore, they realize the banks and the ratings agency are maintaining the value of their CDOs in order to sell and short them before the inevitable crash. Horrified, they try to tip off the press and their families about the upcoming disaster and the rampant fraud but nobody believes them. As the market starts collapsing, Ben, on vacation in England, sells their swaps. Ultimately, they make a profit of $80 million, with their faith in the system broken.\n\nEpilogue\n\nJared Vennett makes $47 million in commissions selling off the swaps. Mark Baum becomes more gracious from the financial fallout, and his staff continues to operate their fund. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley go their separate ways after unsuccessfully trying to sue the ratings agencies, with Charlie moving to Charlotte to start a family, and Jamie still running the fund. Ben Rickert returns to his peaceful retirement. Michael Burry closes his fund after public backlash and multiple IRS audits, now only investing in water commodities. The banks responsible for the crisis escape any consequences for their actions. It is noted that as of 2015, banks are selling CDOs again under a new label: \"Bespoke Tranche Opportunity\".\n\nIn 2013, Paramount acquired the rights to the 2010 non-fiction book \"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine\" by Michael Lewis, to develop it into a film, which Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment would produce. On March 24, 2014, Adam McKay was hired to write and direct a film about the housing and economic bubble. Screenwriter Charles Randolph, who co-wrote the film with McKay, said one of the first challenges was finding the right tone for the film. He told \"Creative Screenwriting\", \"In general it was trying to find the right tone that was slightly funnier than your average Miloš Forman comedy, which is all grounded character-based but not so satirical where you got \"Wag the Dog.\" Somewhere between there was what I was shooting for. Once I got the tone down, then I went through the plot. The market's movements provided you with an underlying plot. You make your short deal, then the bank is trying to squeeze you out, and then it all breaks loose. So that was pretty easy, and it provided character arcs against that.\" Two years after Randolph wrote his draft, McKay, as director, rewrote Randolph's screenplay. It was McKay's idea to include the celebrity cameos in the film to explain the financial concepts.\n\nOn January 13, 2015, \"Variety\" reported that Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, and Ryan Gosling were set to star in the film, with Pitt producing the film along with Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner. Plan B Entertainment would finance, with Paramount handling the distribution rights. Before this, Pitt had already starred in the adaptation of the author's \"Moneyball\", for which he was nominated for an Oscar. On January 14, it was announced that Steve Carell would also star. On April 21, 2015, more cast was revealed by \"Deadline\", including Melissa Leo, Marisa Tomei, Tracy Letts, Hamish Linklater, John Magaro, Byron Mann, Rafe Spall, Jeremy Strong, and Finn Wittrock. Charles Randolph wrote the initial draft. Max Greenfield joined the ensemble cast of the film on April 23, 2015. Karen Gillan tweeted about her involvement in the film on May 8, 2015.\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began on March 18, 2015 in New Orleans, Louisiana. On March 25, filming was taking place on General De Gaulle Boulevard in the Algiers section of New Orleans. On May 8, Gillan confirmed she was shooting her scenes. On May 20, 2015, filming took place on a short stretch of Mercer Street, between Prince Street and Spring Street, in Manhattan, New York City. On May 22, the production crew recreated the offices of failed investment firm Lehman Brothers in the lobby of the New York State Department of Financial Services in Manhattan. An assistant counsel for the Department of Financial Services played one of the extras in the scene.\n\nOn September 22, 2015, Paramount set the film for a limited release on December 11, 2015 and a wide release on December 23, 2015.\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 15, 2016.\n\n\"The Big Short\" grossed $70.3 million in the United States and Canada and $63.2 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $133.4 million, against a production budget of $50 million.\n\nThe film was released in eight theaters in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Chicago on December 11, 2015 and earned $705,527 (an average of $88,191 per theater). It set the record for the best ever per-screen gross for a film opening in eight locations, breaking the previous record held by \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" ($85,313 per theater), and was the third biggest theater average of 2015 behind the four screen debuts of \"Steve Jobs\" ($130,000) and \"The Revenant\" ($118,640).\n\nThe film had its wide release on Wednesday December 23, 2015 and grossed $2.3 million on its first day. In its opening weekend it grossed $10.5 million, finishing 6th at the box office.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 281 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Big Short\" approaches a serious, complicated subject with an impressive attention to detail – and manages to deliver a well-acted, scathingly funny indictment of its real-life villains in the bargain.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nIGN gave the film a score of 8.6/10, praising its \"energetic direction\" and making \"a complicated tale palpable for the layperson even as it triggers outrage at the fatcats who helped cause it\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" \"UpShot\" series stated \"The Big Short\" offered the \"strongest film explanation of the global financial crisis\". The series also stated that it \"wouldn't necessarily have been able to cash in as successfully as the characters in \"The Big Short\". The success of this film is due to the work of the actors who played the characters.\n\nMovie critics with backgrounds in finance also commented on the film. Many agreed with the public that \"The Big Short\" was entertaining and engaging, but also terrifying. Glenn Kenny reported that the film accurately got the message across even though the lives of the characters were not interconnected, their stories were.\n\nSteve Eisman, who is portrayed as Mark Baum in the film, said that he respects Carell's portrayal but that it was not 100 percent true to his real character. Eisman told \"The Globe and Mail\" that he felt his character was too funny. Instead of having a sense of humor, he felt that his character should have been angry all of the time.\n\nAdam McKay and Charles Randolph won the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. They also won an Empire Award for the Best Screenplay. Christian Bale won the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor in a Comedy and the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor (Motion Picture). Hank Corwin won the American Cinema Editors Award for Best Edited Feature Film (Comedy or Musical) and Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Editing.\n\nThe film earned the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Comedy and was named one of the Top 10 Films of the Year at the American Film Institute Awards 2015. Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner, and Brad Pitt won the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture. The cast also won the National Board of Review Award for Best Ensemble.\n\n\n"}

The book discusses what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur, and contains biographical anecdotes from the author and the company he founded, Apax Partners. The book’s title comes from Cohen’s incorrect belief that the second bounce of a ball is difficult to predict.\n\nThe book received positive reviews among the business literary critics. Robert Lenzner, editor of \"Forbes\" magazine, refers to Cohen as a modern-day version of Georges Doriot, one of the first American venture capitalists. In his review, he highlights the biographical aspect of the book, saying that it \"is at bottom about how Cohen progressed from boutique investment banker earning fees on each transaction to the risky business of financing start-up companies, and from there to the more solidly rewarding buyout or private equity business.\"\n\nJonathan Guthrie, from the Financial Times, disagrees. He says that the book \"is not an autobiography. But it is one of the best books written on entrepreneurship in recent years.\" In the review, he stated that some of the advice provided in the book can be found in other business self-help books, but says that Sir Ronald's \"analysis of entrepreneurship is broader and subtler than in most titles.\"\n\n"}

Lange and his endorsement of a planned economy, it was included among the twelve essays in Hayek's 1948 compendium \"Individualism and Economic Order\".\n\nHayek's article argues against the establishment of a Central Pricing Board (advocated by Lange) by highlighting the dynamic and organic nature of market price-fluctuations, and the benefits of this phenomenon. He asserts that a centrally planned economy could never match the efficiency of the open market because what is known by a single agent is only a small fraction of the sum total of knowledge held by all members of society. A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society. In Hayek's words, \"The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one raw material, without an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful of people knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity could not be ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use the material or its products more sparingly; that is, they move in the right direction.\" The article also discusses the concepts of 'individual equilibrium' and of Hayek's notion of the divide between information which is useful and practicable versus that which is purely scientific or theoretical.\n\n\"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" was a sensation among economists, setting off a train of work in the economics of information and other areas, including the work of a number of future Nobel Prize winners, as noted by Nobel winner Leonid Hurwicz. UCLA economist Armen Alchian remembers the excitement of reading Hayek's essay and stopping fellow economists in the hallway to ask if they had read Hayek's essay. In 2011 \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the \"American Economic Review\" during its first 100 years.\n\nJimmy Wales cites \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\", which he read as an undergraduate, as \"central\" to his thinking about \"how to manage the Wikipedia project\". Hayek argued that information is decentralized – that knowledge is unevenly dispersed among different members of society – and that as a result, decisions are best made by those with local knowledge rather than by a central authority.\n\n"}

An entity's debt-to-equity funding is sometimes expressed as a ratio. For example, a gearing ratio of 1.5:1 means that for every $2 of equity the entity has $3 of debt. \n\nA high gearing ratio can create problems for:\n\nIf the shareholders have introduced only a nominal amount of paid-up share capital, then the company has lower financial reserves with which to meet its obligations. If all or most of the company's capital comes from debt, which (unlike equity) needs to be serviced, and ultimately repaid, it means that the providers of capital are ultimately competing with the company's trade creditors for the same capital resources.\n\nIn general, most common law countries tend not to employ thin capitalisation rules in relation to raising and maintenance of capital. However, a number of civil law jurisdictions do.\n\nHowever, in almost all jurisdictions there are certain types of regulated entity which require a certain amount, or a certain proportion, of paid-up share capital to be licensed to trade. The most common examples of this are banks and insurance companies. This is because if such companies were to fail and go into liquidation the economic effect of such failures can lead to a domino effect, which can have catastrophic consequences for other businesses and, ultimately, national economies.\n\nEven where countries’ corporate laws permit companies to be thinly capitalised, revenue authorities in those countries will often limit the amount that a company can claim as a tax deduction on interest, particularly when it receives loans at non-commercial rates (e.g. from connected parties). However, some countries simply disallow interest deductions above a certain level from all sources when the company is considered to be too highly geared under applicable tax regulations.\n\nSome tax authorities limit the applicability of thin capitalisation rules to corporate groups with foreign entities to avoid “tax leakage” to other jurisdictions. The United States “earnings stripping” rules are an example. Hong Kong protects tax revenue by prohibiting payers from claiming tax deductions for interest paid to foreign entities, thus eliminating the possibility of using thin capitalisation to shift income to a lower-tax jurisdiction.\n\nThin capitalisation rules determine how much of the interest paid on corporate debt is deductible for tax purposes. Such rules are of interest to private-equity firms, which use significant amounts of debt to finance leveraged buyouts, and in the context of strategic acquisitions, where the purchaser wishes to push debt into higher taxed countries with significant pre-tax income.\n\n"}

He founded the Corcoran Gallery of Art.\n\nCorcoran was born on December 27, 1798 in Georgetown in the District of Columbia. He was one of 12 children (six boys and six girls), six of whom survived to maturity, born to Thomas Corcoran (1754–1830), a well-to-do merchant twice elected as mayor of Georgetown, and Hannah Lemmon (1765–1823). His father was born in Ireland, settled in Georgetown in 1788, and established a leather business.\n\nWilliam Corcoran was raised in Georgetown where he studied classics and mathematics at local private schools run by Alexander Kirk and the Reverend Addison Belt, and also took classes for a year at Georgetown College, the predecessor of Georgetown University. Instead of finishing his education, he joined the family business and developed a successful business career.\n\nCorcoran entered business at the age of 17, working in dry goods store owned by two brothers, and opened his own branch store two years later. Corcoran brothers established a wholesale auction and commission business, but their ventures failed after the Panic of 1819. He worked in another family business, and in 1828, he took control of large amount of real estate from his father.\n\nCorcoran was employed as a clerk at the Bank of Columbia at Georgetown branch, and then as a real estate and loan manager at the Second Bank of the United States in Washington.\n\nIn 1837, Corcoran established a brokerage firm on Pennsylvania Avenue at 15th Street. He was successful and in 1840 entered into a partnership with George Washington Riggs, a son of Elisha Riggs. The Corcoran and Riggs private banking firm enjoyed the patronage of Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury and prospered after it re-sold to investors $5 million of U.S. Treasury notes in 1843. In 1845, it purchased the former Second Bank of the United States building located on 15th Street at New York Avenue.\n\nIn Spring 1847, the \"Corcoran and Riggs\" sold to investors at home and abroad the bulk of two issues of the U.S. Treasury Mexican War bonds; Corcoran's earnings were $1 million. In 1854, Corcoran retired from \"Corcoran and Riggs\" to focus on his investments in real estate, land grants, armaments, railroads, as well as pursue pleasure and philanthropic endeavors.\n\nIn 1854, after his retirement, he devoted himself and his substantial fortune to art and philanthropy. In 1848, Corcoran had purchased 15 acres (6 ha) of land for Oak Hill Cemetery, which overlooks Rock Creek Park. He organized the Oak Hill Cemetery Company to oversee the cemetery, which was formally incorporated by Act of Congress on March 3, 1849. Corcoran paid for the construction of a Gothic Revival chapel in Oak Hill Cemetery, commonly known as the Renwick Chapel.\n\nCorcoran also established a $10,000 fund, administered by the Benevolent Society, to purchase firewood for the poor in Georgetown. Corcoran also gave many gifts to several universities, including The George Washington University, the Maryland Agricultural College, the College of William and Mary, and Washington and Lee University. Corcoran also contributed to a fund to purchase George Washington's Mount Vernon estate, after his family could no longer keep it up, and the federal government refused to purchase it. One of William Wilson Corcoran's longtime business associate and friend was the renowned George Peabody.\n\nIn contrast to many contemporary art patrons, Corcoran was not exclusively interested in European works, and he assembled one of the first important collections of American art. By the mid-1850s his pictures and sculpture were overflowing his mansion on Lafayette Square and he hired the foremost architect of the day, James Renwick, to build a picture gallery in the Second Empire style on Pennsylvania Avenue. Before it was ready, however, the Civil War began, and Corcoran, a Southern sympathizer, left Washington for Paris, where his son-in-law, George Eustis Jr., was a representative of the Confederacy.\n\nArchitect James Renwick was commissioned in 1859 to a museum building to house William Wilson Corcoran’s growing art collection. Corcoran was a southern sympathizer and good friend of Robert E. Lee, and felt it opportune to leave for Europe during the Civil War. The half-finished building designed by Renwick was taken over by the U.S. Government and used as a supply depot. When the war was over, Corcoran returned to Washington; the building was finished in 1869 and the Corcoran Gallery of Art opened in 1874, but the structure was soon outgrown. A new building for the Corcoran Gallery of Art and its nascent school of art (now the Corcoran College of Art + Design) was designed by American architect Ernest Flagg in the Beaux-Arts Style and completed in 1897, nine years after Corcoran’s death. The façade of the building reflects the “Neo-Grec,” an offshoot of the Beaux-Arts style that attempted to reflect the functions of the building by revealing detailed and decorative accents on the exterior. The Corcoran’s first home is now the Renwick Gallery, a Smithsonian museum.\n\nCorcoran made many other important bequests to the people of Washington, among them the Louise Home for Women, several departments of the Columbian University (now the George Washington University), and the land and half the construction costs for what is now the Church of the Ascension and Saint Agnes. Corcoran was also the President of the Corporation of Columbian (George Washington) University. Early in 1883, Corcoran arranged to have the body of John Howard Payne returned to the United States, an expense he personally bore. Payne, actor, poet, and author of \"Home! Sweet Home!\" had been the United States Consul to the Bey of Tunis in 1852 and had died there. Payne had been good friends of Corcoran and his business partner, George W. Riggs in 1850, prior to Payne's second appointment as Consul to Tunis.\n\nIn 1835, Corcoran eloped and married Louise Morris (1818–1840), who was the daughter of Commodore Charles Morris (1784–1856) and the older sister of Robert Murray Morris (1824–1896). Before his wife's early death on November 21, 1840, they had three children, however, only one survived into adulthood:\n\n\nAfter his wife died in 1840, Corcoran chose not to marry again. He died on February 24, 1888 in Washington, DC and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.).\n\nCorcoran joined the Potomac Lodge No. 5 of Free and Accepted Masons in Georgetown and was raised as a Master Mason on July 26, 1827.\n\nThrough his surviving daughter Louise, he was the grandfather of William Corcoran Eustis (1862–1921) and Louise Marie Eustis Hitchcock (1867–1934), who married Thomas Hitchcock (1860–1941), in 1891.\n\nThe bank Corcoran co-founded in 1840 existed as Riggs Bank up until 2005, when it was taken over by PNC Bank. The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. was one of the oldest American private museums focusing on American art until it was dissolved in 2014 with its holdings transferred to the National Gallery of Art. Corcoran has a street named after him in the Dupont Circle neighborhood in the District of Columbia between Q street and R street NW, one block away from Riggs Street. As well, the Corcoron neighborhood in Minneapolis, Minnesota which is bounded by East Lake Street to the north, East 36th Street to the south, Hiawatha Avenue to the east, and Cedar Avenue to the west, is named for William Corcoran.\n\n"}

It is one of several types of productivity that economists measure. Workforce productivity, often referred to as labor productivity, is a measure for an organization or company, a process, an industry, or a country.\n\nWorkforce productivity is to be distinguished from employee productivity which is a measure employed at \"individual level\" based on the assumption that the overall productivity can be broken down to increasingly smaller units until, ultimately, to the individual employee, in order be used for example for the purpose of allocating a benefit or sanction based on individual performance (see also: Vitality curve).\n\nIn 2002, the OECD defined it as \"the ratio of a volume measure of output to a volume measure of input\". Volume measures of output are normally gross domestic product (GDP) or gross value added (GVA), expressed at constant prices i.e. adjusted for inflation. The three most commonly used measures of input are:\n\nWorkforce productivity can be measured in 2 ways, in physical terms or in price terms.\n\nThese aspects of productivity refer to the \"qualitative\" dimensions of labour input. If an organization is using labour much more intensely, one can assume it's due to greater labour productivity, since the output per labour-effort may be the same. This insight becomes particularly important when a large part of what is produced in an economy consists of services. Management may be very preoccupied with the productivity of employees, but the productivity gains of management itself is very difficult to prove. While labor productivity growth has been seen as a useful barometer of the U.S. economy’s performance, recent research has examined why U.S. labor productivity rose during the recent downturn of 2008–2009, when U.S. gross domestic product plummeted.\n\nThe validity of international comparisons of labour productivity can be limited by a number of measurement issues. The comparability of output measures can be negatively affected by the use of different valuations, which define the inclusion of taxes, margins, and costs, or different deflation indexes, which turn current output into constant output. Labor input can be biased by different methods used to estimate average hours or different methodologies used to estimate employed persons. In addition, for level comparisons of labor productivity, output needs to be converted into a common currency. The preferred conversion factors are Purchasing Power Parities, but their accuracy can be negatively influenced by the limited representativeness of the goods and services compared and different aggregation methods. To facilitate international comparisons of labor productivity, a number of organizations, such as the OECD, the Groningen Growth Centre, International Labor Comparisons Program, and The Conference Board, prepare productivity data adjusted specifically to enhance the data’s international comparability.\n\nIn a survey of manufacturing growth and performance in Britain and Mauritius, it was found that:\n\"The factors affecting labour productivity or the performance of individual work roles are of broadly the same type as those that affect the performance of manufacturing firms as a whole. They include: (1) physical-organic, location, and technological factors; (2) cultural belief-value and individual attitudinal, motivational and behavioural factors; (3) international influences – e.g. levels of innovativeness and efficiency on the part of the owners and managers of inward investing foreign companies; (4) managerial-organizational and wider economic and political-legal environments; (5) levels of flexibility in internal labour markets and the organization of work activities – e.g. the presence or absence of traditional craft demarcation lines and barriers to occupational entry; and (6) individual rewards and payment systems, and the effectiveness of personnel managers and others in recruiting, training, communicating with, and performance-motivating employees on the basis of pay and other incentives.\"\nIt was further found that:\n\"The emergence of computers has been noted as a significant factor in increasing labor productivity in the late 1990s, by some, and as an insignificant factor by others, such as R.J. Gordon. Although computers have existed for most of the 20th century, some economic researchers have noted a lag in productivity growth caused by computers that didn't come until the late 1990s.\"\n\n"}
