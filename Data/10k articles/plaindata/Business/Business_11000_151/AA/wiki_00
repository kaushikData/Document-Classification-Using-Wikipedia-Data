Completed in 1987, the building has 36 floors and stands at . It is home to Daiwa Capital Markets USA, Inc. Convene, AIG Global Real Estate, Goldman Sachs, the New York Regional Office of the United States Census Bureau, and the ground floor houses the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) Engine Company 4 and Ladder Company 15.\n\nThe building site originally held the United States Assay Office, the last public gold refinery in the United States. It also melted damaged coins and incinerated damaged paper money. In 1983, the United States Mint put the property up for auction. Beginning at US$3 million, the winning bid was made by HRO International Ltd., a New York realty developer, at $27 million. The sale established it as the most valuable government estate sold at public auction. The Assay office building was demolished in 1986.\n\nIn 1987, HRO built the 36-floor building that stands today, naming the 23-43 Old Slip property One Financial Square. The Paramount Group purchased the property for $135 million in 1995, then in August 2007 sold it to Beacon Capital Partners for $751 million, which is one of the largest sales on record of an office building in Lower Manhattan.\n\nLike many buildings in Lower Manhattan, 32 Old Slip was battered with storm waters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In contrast to most in the region, the building was designed to resist a powerful earthquake, which in part made the structure less prone to flooding. Within a year the building's market value declined by 21.6% ($65.7 million). In 2013 a renovation effort began to add improved flood barriers, pumps and piping systems to better ward against future storms.\n\nThe building is considered to be postmodern. Four sides of granite and silver-tinted glass make up the base, which give way to stepped transitions, eventually resulting in an octagonal, entirely glass curtain wall.\n\nThe floor sizes range from 23,404 to 38,750 rentable square feet, totaling 1,161,435 rentable square feet. It consists of columnless interior on each floor and a lobby. There are 26 elevators in service and a parking garage beneath the structure. The ground level side and rear of the building feature a privately owned arcade and urban plaza.\n\n"}

Honorary Builder of Russia.\n\nIn 2008 Finance magazine estimated his personal wealth at $1.1 billion and included him in their list of 100 richest people in Russia (ranked 91) and named him as one of the ten richest businessmen in St. Petersburg.\n\nFrom 2010 Artur Kirilenko is actively engaged in property management and financing of real estate development projects both in Russia and in Europe.\n\nIn 1991 Artur Kirilenko graduated from Industrial Technical School (\"Gorlovsky Technical School of Donetsk National University\") as mining foreman. For some time he was working at Komsomolskaya coal mine.\n\nIn 2000 he graduated from the Department of Economics and Management in Construction Business at Saint-Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering.\n\nIn 2002 he successfully defended his thesis \"Competitiveness of a Construction Business\" at Saint-Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering to become a PhD in economics.\n\nIn 1991—1992 served in military.\n\nIn 1993 relocated to St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nIn 1994 Artur Kirilenko along with Sergei Polonsky founded construction company Stroymontazh in St. Petersburg and remained its owner and CEO between 1994 and 2010.\n\nIn 2000 Stroymontazh corporation opened a branch in Moscow, which had been headed by Sergei Polonsky. Artur Kirilenko remained a head of the St. Petersburg business of the group. In 2002 Polonsky and Kirilenko divided up the business and in 2004 Polonsky created Mirax Group on the basis of the Moscow branch end exited the St. Petersburg business of Stroymontazh: after dividing up the business Artur Kirilenko became a sole owner of Stroymontazh.\n\nIn 2004 Stroymontazh has delivered over 100,000 sq. meters of residential property and became the leader among the property developers in St. Petersburg.\n\nBy 2008 Stroymontazh controlled about 10% of the construction market in St Petersburg in the residential sector. In 2008 the company delivered 286,000 square metres of residential property and its sales revenue exceeded 5.5 billion roubles (€150 million). Since inception the company built over 800,000 square metres of residential and 60,000 square metres of commercial property.\n\nThe company suffered considerable losses as a result of the financial crisis of 2008-2010 and a corporate conflict with one of its creditors \"Baltisky Bank\", which was subsequently bailed out by Alfa-Bank. in 2010 Stroymontazh went into administration and in July 2015 the company was liquidated.\n\nIn 2003 Stroymontazh corporation established a French subsidiary named Stroimotage de Paris and subsequently renamed Hermitage. Emin Iskenderov has become the head of the French operations.\n\nIn 2006 Hermitage began construction of its first project Les Allees de l’Hermitage, which was successfully completed in 2008 and was named the best residential development in Ile-de-France.\n\nThis was followed by such projects as:\n\nAvant-Seine for 300 apartments, completed in 2009;\n\nDomaine du Lac for 1000 apartments, completed in 2009; \n\nLe Jardin des Muses for 200 apartments, completed in 2012.\n\nIn 2007 Hermitage started working on the project of mixed-use towers Hermitage Plaza.\n\nFor this project Hermitage partnered with the British architect Sir Norman Foster, French conglomerate Bouygues, as well as Khight Frank, KPMG, Cushman&Wakefield and others.

Artur Kirilenko acted as a guarantor for the loans and \"Baltisky Bank\" also sued him personally for 1.2 billion rubles (€33 million). Apart from this \"Baltisky Bank\" also initiated a criminal investigation, which was eventually dropped as the inquiry found no instances of criminal conduct or wrongdoing in Kirilenko’s actions.

In 1862 the enterprise was liquidated due to lack of sufficient capital to cover the high investment expenses.\nRogé managed to raise capital in the Saarland and restart the business, selling most of its production to forges in the Ardennes and Champagne.\nIn 1866 Rogé visited England and became aware of the new and promising market for cast-iron water pipes.\nHe focused the company on pipe production, and found a ready market when cities began to make large investment in water supply after 1871.\nHe adopted the English method of casting pipes in vertical rather than horizontal moulds.\n\nCamille Cavallier joined the Société de Pont-à-Mousson on 1 August 1874.\nAt this time the company consisted only of the factory at Pont-à-Mousson and the Marbache Iron Mine in the Nancy Basin.\nThe blast furnaces produced only 50,000 tons per year, of which only 12,000 tons were made into moulded products, mainly cast iron pipes.\nCavallier worked at the company for four months before being called up on 5 November 1874 for a year of military service, which he spent at Versailles in the 1st Regiment of Engineers.\nHe was discharged as a second lieutenant of the reserve on 1 November 1875.\nHe returned to the Société de Pont-à-Mousson on 2 November 1875, where he would work for the rest of his life.\n\nCamille Cavallier was first assigned to the \"flat\" foundry, then in 1876 to the \"standing\" foundry dedicated to making iron gutters and pipes.\nIn 1877 Rogé gave him charge of the newly created commercial service.\nThe job was to establish regional agencies, monitor demand, watch competitors and draw up quotations for tenders.\nHe achieved excellent results in selling the cast iron pipes, and in 1883 won the tenders for the city of Paris.\nRogé decided to groom Cavallier as his successor, and in the 1880s Cavallier became in effect the director-general, although Rogé retained that title.\nCavallier did not limit himself to the commercial side, but played a large role in building up the company's mining assets.\nThe company depended on the Marbache and Custines mines in the Nancy Basin, which delivered about 100,000 tons of ore annually.\nAfter surveys of the Millery region the company asked for a mining concession there, but was refused.\nXavier Rogé began to investigate land around Auboué near the part of Lorraine that had been annexed by Germany, and on 1 December 1882 found the upper layers of the iron oxide formation of the Briey Basin.\nThe survey then stopped, since the company undertaking it declared that the iron oxide formation had been completely crossed.\nCavallier thought there could be lower layers, and obtained permission to continue the survey.\nIn April 1883 a layer thick was found, and on 11 August 1884 the Société de Pont-à-Mousson was granted the concession.\nThe technicians said that it would be very difficult to pass through the overburden above the Auboué ore deposit due to the amount of water it contained.\nCavallier decided to proceed anyway, using the freezing method to pass through the aquifer layer, although this method had not been used for more than in the past. The gamble succeeded.\n\nThe Pont-à-Mousson ironworks was transformed into a \"societe anonyme\" in 1886, with Xavier Rogé as its sole administrator.\nRogé fell seriously ill in 1888 and depended more and more on Cavallier, then aged 34.\nOn 17 August 1888 the company was granted the Vieux-Château concession, and on 25 May 1892 was granted the Belleville concession, both in the Nancy Basin.\nThe company acquired the Malzéville and Grande Goutte mines in the Nancy Basin.\nIn the 1890s the blast furnaces were fitted with Cowper regenerative heat exchangers.\nUntil 1889 Cavallier had no shares in the company.\nIn 1890 he acquired 100 shares, and in 1898 another 136.\nWhen Rogé was sick Cavallier acted as the effective head of the company, and on 15 January 1895 he was named deputy director.\n\nAbout 1878 Camille Cavallier married Thérèse Julie Mangeot ().\nTheir children were Charles (1879–1930) and Jeanne Marguerite Françoise (b. ).\nAround 1908 his daughter married Marcel Paul (1879–1946).\n\nOn 31 January 1899 Camille Cavallier was made joint administrator, and became sole administrator when Rogé retired the next year.\nOn 31 March 1899 Cavallier obtained the Mairy concession in the Briey Basin for the company.\nSince becoming head of the company Cavallier devoted a large part of his salary to buying shares in the company.\nIn 1900, Cavallier held only 8% of the capital of Pont-à-Mousson, with 236 shares.\nBy the time of the meeting of 9 January 1901 he had become the largest shareholder with 816 shares, or 28%, due to acquisition of the shares of Xavier Rogé.\nBy 1912 he controlled 36.8%, including the shares of his family members.\nBy 1910 Cavallier was worth 10 million gold francs, a large but not huge amount.\nAfter World War I he controlled 43% of the company's capital.\nHis motivation seems to have been primarily to build up the enterprise through hard work rather than to make a personal fortune.\n\nCavallier built his house beside the factory on the Nancy–Metz road so that he could be \"in the middle of his hive.\"\nHe would work long hours, from 6 in the morning until late at night.\nA general strike started at Pont-à-Mousson in September 1905, the first, triggered by dismissal of the union's treasurer but caused by long-running grievances over pay.\nThe strike was a shock to the management.\nCavallier founded the Fête du travail (Labour Festival) in 1906 in an attempt to reunite the community.\nIn 1910 the steelmaker François de Wendel ran for election as deputy in Briey, opposed by a local physician who was supported by the Fédération républicaine. \nHe lost by 3,506 votes to the doctor's 3,820.\nWendel was convinced, perhaps correctly, that Cavallier had engineered his defeat since he distrusted Wendel's dealings with union leaders and thought he had encouraged the strike .\nUnlike self-made men such as Cavallier and Alexandre Dreux of the Aciéries de Longwy, Wendel was aristocratic, which did not endear him with the other industrialists.\nCavallier transformed the moderately sized cast iron pipe manufacturer into a giant, always concentrating on making pipes.\nAnnual cast iron production rose from 80,000 to 183,000 tons between 1900 and 1913.\nCavallier studied use of blast furnace gas for production of electrical power, built a test station, then built a large central power station.\nHe continued to increase the percent of pipes in the company output.\nIn 1903 he installed blast furnaces at Auboué.\nIn 1905 he built a foundry at Foug, throwing up the building and furnaces in a month.\nIn 1905 Cavallier purchased the Moineville concession, which was later merged with the Auboué concession.\nThe company acquired control of the Bayard foundries in Haute-Marne.\nIt also took stakes in the Micheville and Marine-Homécourt steel makers, and after the war would take interests in steelworks in Lorraine and the Saar.\n\nAt the 23 January 1900 meeting Cavallier pointed out the importance of securing a supply of coke, and proposed to acquire a concession to open a new coal mine.\nIn January 1902 Cavallier began to discuss a joint operation with the Société de Micheville and the Société du Nord et de l'Est to exploit coal deposits in northern Belgium, leading to incorporation of the Société Campinoise on 11 April 1902.\nThe Beeringen-Coursel concession was granted to a group of three exploration companies on 26 November 1906, and Pont-à-Mousson participated in creation of the Société des Charbonnages de Beeringen (Beringen Coal Company) on 23 February 1907.\nThe Beringen deposit was rich, but covered by a layer thick of sands containing aquifers. It was not until after World War I (1914–18) that the first pit was opened on 26 December 1921.\nIn Lorraine Cavallier explored for a continuation of the Saarbrücken coalfield.\nA test drill of near the central station of the Pont-à-Mousson plant found several layers of coal, but only at great depth.\nThe company took an interest in coal mines in several other parts of northern France.\n\nAt the start of World War I the Pont-à-Mousson factory was occupied by the Germans for a few days, and remained less than from the front line.\nAuboué was occupied.\nThe Foug factory remained in operation, and was converted to manufacture of munitions.\nWorkshops were established at Belleville in 1916 and Sens in 1917.\nIn 1917 Cavallier founded the Fonderie Lorraine to manufacture war materials in Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray, near Rouen.\nHis son in law, Marcel Paul, was given responsibility for the plant, which was built on between the railway and the river.\nBy the end of the war 20% of French shells were being made from cast iron in the Foug foundry.\n\nAt the 24 January 1917 general meeting Cavallier proposed to appoint a board of directors with representatives of capital and labour.\nCavallier became deputy chairman in 1917, and three administrators were named.\nMarcel Paul was titled \"administrateur délégué\" and the other two were titled \"administrateur directeur général\".\nTowards the end of the war study groups under Humbert de Wendel defined the demands of the Comite des Forges for the post-war settlement.\nThey wanted return of Alsace-Lorraine, cession of the Saar and transfer of Luxembourg from the German Customs Union to a union with Belgium.\nCamille Cavallier was one of a small number of iron masters who also wanted the left bank of the Rhine.\n\nIn the post-war period the company faced a massive task of reconstruction, while training new workers to replace those lost in the war.\nIn 1919–20 Pont-à-Mousson took over a major pipe-making facility in the Saar.\nThe company also acquired interests in Lorraine companies that had been liquidated, notably Rombas, and acquired interests in coal mines in the Saar and Moselle.\nPresident Raymond Poincaré lit the first reconstructed blast furnace at Pont-à-Mousson 23 November 1919 in a solemn ceremony.\nWithin France, Cavallier was in favor of quota agreements between competing companies to prevent destructive price wars.\nGerman demand for iron from Lorraine plummeted after World War I (1914–18).\nBy 1922 total demand was just a tenth of the pre-war demand from the Ruhr alone.\nContributing factors were the growing use of the Siemens-Martin process of open hearth furnaces for recycling scrap steel combined with availability of war material to be recycled. \nIn early 1922 Robert Pinot of the Comité des forges explained to Camille Cavallier that this had \"permitted a boycotting of our \"minette\" ore these past years.\"\nHowever, Pont-à-Mousson gradually regained its export markets.\nOn 7 May 1924 Cavallier said the company was self-sufficient in iron ore, and would soon be self-sufficient in coke.\nIt was not until 1925 that Cavallier was able to announce that production had returned to prewar levels.\nWhen Cavallier died in 1926 annual production had reached 237,000 tons.\nHis strategy as a pipe specialist led him to move into the export market early on so the company would not depend on fluctuating domestic demand.\nBy the time he died half of the company's output was exported, with 450 foreign cities using Pont-à-Mousson pipes, 127 of them outside of Europe.\nCavallier knew that exports forced industry to become more competitive and efficient, and reduced costs helped domestic customers.\n\nCavallier became Vice-President of the Nancy Chamber of Commerce and a member of many committees and associations.\nHe died of a heart attack on 10 June 1926 at his property of Gentilly, at Maxéville, near Nancy, the day after presiding over a general shareholders meeting.\nAt the time of his death he was a member of the board of the Comité des Forges de France, director of about twenty companies, and had received many honors and official commissions.\nCavallier had chosen his son-in-law, Marcel Paul, as his successor.\nThe heirs of Xavier Rogé and two other shareholders, Colonel Plassiart and the Lorraine banker Paul Lenglet, still had sizeable shareholdings.\nIn the early 1920s Cavallier arranged for them to form a pact within a financial company, Filor (Financière Lorraine).\nThis lasted until 1964, when the founding families still controlled 50% of the capital of Pont-à-Mousson.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25434268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25434268", "title": "Cellophane paradox", "text": "Cellophane paradox\n\nThe Cellophane Paradox (also the Cellophane Trap or Cellophane Fallacy or Gingerbread Paradox) describes a type of incorrect reasoning used in market regulation methods.\n\nThe paradox arises when a firm sells a product with few substitutes, which in turn allows the firm to increase the price of that product. The original reason was that as the price increases, the product will reach a point where it begins to attract more and more substitutes. In technical economic terms, such a product has very low cross-price elasticity of demand. The situation is linked to a United States Supreme Court case and a subsequent response in economic literature.\n\nCellophane was a DuPont Company plastic wrapping material that had its U.S. production restricted to du Pont by numerous patents in the early 1950s. Du Pont was sued under the Sherman Act for monopolization of the cellophane market by the U.S. Justice Department, and the case (\"U.S. v. E. I. du Pont\") was decided by the Supreme Court in 1956. The Court agreed with du Pont that when evaluated at the monopolistic price observed in the early 1950s, there were many substitutes for cellophane and, therefore, du Pont had only a small share of the market for wrapping materials (i.e., it possessed little or no market power).\n\nThis reasoning was challenged by a 1955 article in the American Economic Review. In research on the du Pont company arising from his PhD dissertation, Willard F. Mueller and co-author George W. Stocking, Sr. pointed out the error of mistaking a monopolist's inability to exercise market power by raising price above the \"current\" price for an inability to have already exercised market power by raising price significantly above the \"competitive\" price. Courts that use a monopolized product's elevated market price will typically misconstrue a completed anti-competitive act as a lack of market power. Had the Supreme Court considered the substitutability of other wrappings at cellophane's competitive price, the sales of other wrappings would have been much lower; du Pont might very well have been found guilty of monopolizing the market for flexible wrappings.\n\nAs Richard Posner wrote, \n\"Reasonable interchangeability at the current price but not at a competitive price level, far from\ndemonstrating the absence of monopoly power, might well be a symptom of that power; this\nelementary point was completely overlooked by the court\"\nThe problem continues to bedevil efforts by antitrust agencies to define markets. Defining markets by cross-elasticity of demand requires a reference price: If I raise my price by 5% from some base level, will people switch to a competing good? The problem is that a firm that actually does have a monopoly power still faces constraints on its ability to charge whatever price it wants; those constraints are set by consumers’ willingness to pay. If a monopolist already charges the profit-maximizing price, an increase above that price will cause consumers to stop buying the product; that’s why the lower price was already profit-maximizing. So we can’t just use the price a company already charges as the base level, or we will conclude that even monopolists lack market power.\n\nAntitrust can solve this problem by using some measure of average cost, not the actual market price, as the baseline for the question whether a merger would allow the merged firm to increase price. But that means that the relevant question is not whether consumers would pay more for a can of Coke or a Harry Potter novel than they currently do; it is whether they would pay 5% more for the can of Coke than it cost to make, deliver, and sell it. \n\n"}
{"id": "1919715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1919715", "title": "Charles Koch Arena", "text": "Charles Koch Arena\n\nCharles Koch Arena is a 10,506-seat multi-purpose arena in Wichita, Kansas, United States. It is located on the southeast corner of 21st and Hillside on the campus of Wichita State University in northeast Wichita. The arena is home of the Wichita State Shockers men's basketball, women's basketball, and women's volleyball teams.\n\nThe arena was originally built in 1953 as the University of Wichita Field House by what was then the Municipal University of Wichita. It was considered several years ahead of its time because of its circular design, which gave nearly every fan a clear sight line and put the seats very close to the action. As a result, it was quickly nicknamed \"The Roundhouse,\" a name that has stuck to this day. When Wichita joined the state university system in 1964, the arena was renamed the WSU Field House.\n\nIn 1969, the arena was officially renamed Levitt Arena after Wichita department store magnate Henry Levitt, who had recently died. Levitt's Wichita clothing store sponsored basketball team won three consecutive national Amateur Athletic Union titles in the 1930s at a time when colleges and corporate-sponsored teams competed in the same tournament.\n\n Following a $6 million endowment from Charles Koch the arena underwent a $25 million renovation in 2002–03, popularly known as the \"Roundhouse Renaissance.\" The old arena concourse was completely demolished and a new one built around the original playing/seating area. A portion of the seating bowl was remodeled to make for more legroom. All new seating was installed as well as a video scoreboard, and virtually every surface that was not renovated was given a fresh coat of paint. The Shocker basketball teams played at the Kansas Coliseum for the 2002–03 season while the arena was rebuilt, while the volleyball team played at the Heskett Center on the WSU campus.\n\nKoch Arena hosted the 2008 Kansas State High School Activities Association Class 6A state wrestling tournament. The arena also hosts numerous high school basketball games involving schools from the Wichita City League. The KSHSAA Class 6A boys and girls basketball state tournaments moved to Koch Arena from Emporia State University's William L. White Auditorium in 2011.\n\nAs Levitt Arena it hosted the 1977 and 1989 Missouri Valley Conference men's basketball tournament title game. It also hosted games for the opening rounds of the 1981 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.\n\nIn addition to concerts, the arena has also hosted the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus, Disney on Ice and Champions on Ice as both Levitt Arena and Koch Arena. American Idols Live! has performed annually at Koch Arena since 2003.\n\nIn December 2012, ESPN ranked Charles Koch Arena at number 10 in the nation in a poll on home-court advantages in College Basketball. In January 2013, ESPN's Jason King listed Koch Arena as the 7th best home court advantage in college basketball.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41920", "title": "Compact Disc Digital Audio", "text": "Compact Disc Digital Audio\n\nCompact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA or CD-DA), also known as Audio CD, is the standard format for audio compact discs. The standard is defined in the Red Book, one of a series of \"Rainbow Books\" (named for their binding colors) that contain the technical specifications for all CD formats.\n\nThe \"Red Book\" specifies the physical parameters and properties of the CD, the optical \"stylus\" parameters, deviations and error rate, modulation system (eight-to-fourteen modulation, EFM) and error correction facility (cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding, CIRC), and the eight subcode channels. These parameters are common to all compact discs and used by all logical formats, such as CD-ROM. The standard also specifies the form of digital audio encoding: 2-channel signed 16-bit Linear PCM sampled at 44,100 Hz. Although rarely used, the specification allows for discs to be mastered with a form of emphasis.\n\nThe first edition of the \"Red Book\" was released in 1980 by Philips and Sony; it was adopted by the Digital Audio Disc Committee and ratified by the International Electrotechnical Commission Technical Committee 100, as an International Standard in 1987 with the reference IEC 60908. The second edition of IEC 60908 was published in 1999 and it cancels and replaces the first edition, amendment 1 (1992) and the corrigendum to amendment 1. The IEC 60908 however does not contain all the information for extensions that is available in the Red Book, such as the details for CD-Text, CD+G and CD+EG.\n\nThe standard is not freely available and must be licensed. It is available from Philips and the IEC. , Philips outsources licensing of the standard to Adminius, which charges for the \"Red Book\", plus each for the \"Subcode Channels R-W\" and \"CD Text Mode\" annexes.\n\nThe audio contained in a CD-DA consists of two-channel signed 16-bit Linear PCM sampled at 44,100 Hz.\n\nThe sampling rate is adapted from that attained when recording digital audio on a PAL (or NTSC) videotape with a PCM adaptor, an earlier way of storing digital audio. An audio CD can represent frequencies up to 22.05 kHz, the Nyquist frequency of the 44.1 kHz sample rate.\n\nThe selection of the sample rate was based primarily on the need to reproduce the audible frequency range of 20–20,000 Hz (20 kHz). The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem states that a sampling rate of more than twice the maximum frequency of the signal to be recorded is needed, resulting in a required rate of at least 40 kHz. The exact sampling rate of 44.1 kHz was inherited from a method of converting digital audio into an analog video signal for storage on U-matic video tape, which was the most affordable way to transfer data from the recording studio to the CD manufacturer at the time the CD specification was being developed. The device that converts an analog audio signal into PCM audio, which in turn is changed into an analog video signal is called a PCM adaptor. This technology could store six samples (three samples per stereo channel) in a single horizontal line. 60 field/s black and white video (not 59.94 color) was required, and in NTSC countries (USA/Japan) that video signal has 245 usable lines per field, which works out to be (245 * 60 * 3) = 44,100 samples/s/stereo channel. Similarly, PAL has 294 lines and 50 fields, which gives 44,100 samples/s/stereo channel. This system could store 14-bit samples with some error correction, or 16-bit samples with almost no error correction.\n\nThere was a long debate over the use of 14-bit (Philips) or 16-bit (Sony) quantization, and 44,056 or 44,100 samples/s (Sony) or approximately 44,000 samples/s (Philips). When the Sony/Philips task force designed the Compact Disc, Philips had already developed a 14-bit D/A converter (DAC), but Sony insisted on 16-bit. In the end, 16 bits and 44.1 kilosamples per second prevailed. Philips found a way to produce 16-bit quality using its 14-bit DAC by using four times oversampling.\n\nSome CDs are mastered with pre-emphasis, an artificial boost of high audio frequencies. The pre-emphasis improves the apparent signal-to-noise ratio by making better use of the channel's dynamic range. On playback, the player applies a de-emphasis filter to restore the frequency response curve to an overall flat one. Pre-emphasis time constants are 50µs and 15µs (9.49 dB boost at 20 kHz), and a binary flag in the disc subcode instructs the player to apply de-emphasis filtering if appropriate. Playback of such discs in a computer or 'ripping' to wave files typically does not take into account the pre-emphasis, so such files play back with a distorted frequency response.\n\nThe creators of the CD originally aimed at a playing time of 60 minutes with a disc diameter of 100 mm (Sony) or 115 mm (Philips). Sony vice-president Norio Ohga suggested extending the capacity to 74 minutes to accommodate the recording of Wilhelm Furtwängler conducting Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the 1951 Bayreuth Festival. The additional 14-minute playing time subsequently required changing to a 120 mm disc. Kees Schouhamer Immink, Philips' chief engineer, however, denies this, claiming that the increase was motivated by technical considerations, and that even after the increase in size, the Furtwängler recording would not have fit on one of the earliest CDs.\n\nAccording to a \"Sunday Tribune\" interview, the story is slightly more involved. In 1979, Philips owned PolyGram, one of the world's largest distributors of music. PolyGram had set up a large experimental CD plant in Hannover, Germany, which could produce huge numbers of CDs having a diameter of 115 mm. Sony did not yet have such a facility. If Sony had agreed on the 115-mm disc, Philips would have had a significant competitive edge in the market. The long playing time of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony imposed by Ohga was used to push Philips to accept 120 mm, so that Philips' PolyGram lost its edge on disc fabrication.\n\nThe 74-minute playing time of a CD, which is longer than the 22 minutes per side typical of long-playing (LP) vinyl albums, was often used to the CD's advantage during the early years when CDs and LPs vied for commercial sales. CDs would often be released with one or more bonus tracks, enticing consumers to buy the CD for the extra material. However, attempts to combine double LPs onto one CD occasionally resulted in the opposite situation in which the CD would instead offer fewer tracks than the LP.\n\nPlaying times beyond 74 minutes are achieved by decreasing track pitch (the distance separating the track as it spirals the disc) in violation of strict \"Red Book\" standards. However, most players can still accommodate the more closely spaced data if it is still within \"Red Book\" tolerances. Current manufacturing processes allow an audio CD to contain up to 80 minutes (variable from one replication plant to another) without requiring the content creator to sign a waiver releasing the plant owner from responsibility if the CD produced is marginally or entirely unreadable by some playback equipment. In current practice, maximum CD playing time has crept higher by reducing minimum engineering tolerances.\n\nThis table shows the progression in the maximum duration of released audio CDs:\n\nEach audio sample is a signed 16-bit two's complement integer, with sample values ranging from −32768 to +32767. The source audio data is divided into frames, containing twelve samples each (six left and right samples, alternating), for a total of 192 bits (24 bytes) of audio data per frame.\n\nThis stream of audio frames, as a whole, is then subjected to CIRC encoding, which segments and rearranges the data and expands it with parity bits in a way that allows occasional read errors to be detected and corrected. CIRC encoding also interleaves the audio frames throughout the disc over several consecutive frames so that the information will be more resistant to burst errors. Therefore, a physical frame on the disc will actually contain information from multiple logical audio frames. This process adds 64 bits of error correction data to each frame. After this, 8 bits of subcode or subchannel data are added to each of these encoded frames, which is used for control and addressing when playing the CD.\n\nCIRC encoding plus the subcode byte generate 33-bytes long frames, called \"channel-data\" frames. These frames are then modulated through eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM), where each 8-bit word is replaced with a corresponding 14-bit word designed to reduce the number of transitions between 0 and 1. This reduces the density of physical pits on the disc and provides an additional degree of error tolerance. Three \"merging\" bits are added before each 14-bit word for disambiguation and synchronization. In total there are 33 × (14 + 3) = 561 bits. A 27-bit word (a 24-bit pattern plus 3 merging bits) is added to the beginning of each frame to assist with synchronization, so the reading device can locate frames easily. With this, a frame ends up containing 588 bits of \"channel data\" (which are decoded to only 192 bits music).\n\nThe frames of channel data are finally written to disc physically in the form of pits and lands, with each pit or land representing a series of zeroes, and with the transition points—the edge of each pit—representing 1.\nA Red Book-compatible CD-R has pit-and-land-shaped spots on a layer of organic dye instead of actual pits and lands; a laser creates the spots by altering the reflective properties of the dye.\n\nThe audio data stream in an audio CD is continuous, but has three parts. The main portion, which is further divided into playable audio tracks, is the \"program area\". This section is preceded by a \"lead-in\" track and followed by a \"lead-out\" track. The lead-in and lead-out tracks encode only silent audio, but all three sections contain subcode data streams.\n\nThe lead-in's subcode contains repeated copies of the disc's Table Of Contents (TOC), which provides an index of the start positions of the tracks in the program area and lead-out. The track positions are referenced by absolute timecode, relative to the start of the program area, in MSF format: minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds called \"frames\". Each timecode frame is one seventy-fifth of a second, and corresponds to a block of 98 channel-data frames—ultimately, a block of 588 pairs of left and right audio samples. Timecode contained in the subchannel data allows the reading device to locate the region of the disc that corresponds to the timecode in the TOC. The TOC on discs is analogous to the partition table on hard drives. Nonstandard or corrupted TOC records are abused as a form of CD/DVD copy protection, in e.g. the key2Audio scheme.\n\nThe largest entity on a CD is called a track. A CD can contain up to 99 tracks (including a data track for mixed mode discs). Each track can in turn have up to 100 indexes, though players which handle this feature are rarely found outside of pro audio, particularly radio broadcasting. The vast majority of songs are recorded under index 1, with the pre-gap being index 0. Sometimes hidden tracks are placed at the end of the last track of the disc, often using index 2 or 3. This is also the case with some discs offering \"101 sound effects\", with 100 and 101 being indexed as two and three on track 99. The index, if used, is occasionally put on the track listing as a decimal part of the track number, such as 99.2 or 99.3. (Information Society's \"Hack\" was one of very few CD releases to do this, following a release with an equally obscure CD+G feature.) The track and index structure of the CD were carried forward to the DVD format as title and chapter, respectively.\n\nTracks, in turn, are divided into timecode frames (or sectors), which are further subdivided into channel-data frames.\n\nThe smallest entity in a CD is a channel-data \"frame\", which consists of 33 bytes and contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples: 24 bytes for the audio (two bytes × two channels × six samples = 24 bytes), eight CIRC error-correction bytes, and one subcode byte. As described in the \"Data encoding\" section, after the EFM modulation the number of bits in a frame totals 588.\n\nOn a \"Red Book\" audio CD, data is addressed using the \"MSF scheme\", with timecodes expressed in minutes, seconds and another type of \"frames\" (mm:ss:ff), where one frame corresponds to 1/75th of a second of audio: 588 pairs of left and right samples. This timecode frame is distinct from the 33-byte channel-data frame described above, and is used for time display and positioning the reading laser. When editing and extracting CD audio, this timecode frame is the smallest addressable time interval for an audio CD; thus, track boundaries only occur on these frame boundaries. Each of these structures contains 98 channel-data frames, totaling 98 × 24 = 2,352 bytes of music. The CD is played at a speed of 75 frames (or sectors) per second, thus 44,100 samples or 176,400 bytes per second.\n\nIn the 1990s, CD-ROM and related Digital Audio Extraction (DAE) technology introduced the term \"sector\" to refer to each timecode frame, with each sector being identified by a sequential integer number starting at zero, and with tracks aligned on sector boundaries. An audio CD sector corresponds to 2,352 bytes of decoded data. The \"Red Book\" does not refer to sectors, nor does it distinguish the corresponding sections of the disc's data stream except as \"frames\" in the MSF addressing scheme.\n\nThe following table shows the relation between tracks, timecode frames (sectors) and channel-data frames:\n\nThe audio bit rate for a \"Red Book\" audio CD is 1,411,200 bits per second or 176,400 bytes per second; 2 channels × 44,100 samples per second per channel × 16 bits per sample. Audio data coming in from a CD is contained in sectors, each sector being 2,352 bytes, and with 75 sectors containing 1 second of audio. For comparison, the bit rate of a \"1×\" CD-ROM is defined as 2,048 bytes per sector × 75 sectors per second = 153,600 bytes per second. The remaining 304 bytes in a sector are used for additional data error correction.\n\nUnlike on a DVD or CD-ROM, there are no \"files\" on a \"Red Book\" audio CD; there is only one continuous stream of LPCM audio data, and a parallel, smaller set of 8 subcode data streams. Computer operating systems, however, may provide access to an audio CD as if it contains files. For example, Windows represents the CD's Table of Contents as a set of Compact Disc Audio track (CDA) files, each file containing indexing information, not audio data.\n\nIn a process called ripping, digital audio extraction software can be used to read CD-DA audio data and store it in files. Common audio file formats for this purpose include WAV and AIFF, which simply preface the LPCM data with a short header; FLAC, ALAC, and Windows Media Audio Lossless, which compress the LPCM data in ways that conserve space yet allow it to be restored without any changes; and various lossy, perceptual coding formats like MP3 and AAC, which modify and compress the audio data in ways that irreversibly change the audio, but that exploit features of human hearing to make the changes difficult to discern.\n\nRecording publishers have created CDs that violate the \"Red Book\" standard. Some do so for the purpose of copy prevention, using systems like Copy Control. Some do so for extra features such as DualDisc, which includes both a CD layer and a DVD layer whereby the CD layer is much thinner, 0.9 mm, than required by the \"Red Book\", which stipulates a nominal 1.2 mm, but at least 1.1 mm. Philips and many other companies have stated that including the Compact Disc Digital Audio logo on such non-conforming discs may constitute trademark infringement.\n\nSuper Audio CD was a standard published in 1999 that aimed to provide better audio quality in CDs, but it never became very popular. DVD Audio, an advanced version of the audio CD, emerged in 1999. The format was designed to feature audio of higher fidelity. It applies a higher sampling rate and uses 650 nm lasers.\n\nThere have been moves by the recording industry to make audio CDs (Compact Disc Digital Audio) unplayable on computer CD-ROM drives, to prevent the copying of music. This is done by intentionally introducing errors onto the disc that the embedded circuits on most stand-alone audio players can automatically compensate for, but which may confuse CD-ROM drives. Consumer rights advocates as of October 2001 pushed to require warning labels on compact discs that do not conform to the official Compact Disc Digital Audio standard (often called the Red Book) to inform consumers which discs do not permit full fair use of their content.\n\nIn 2005, Sony BMG Music Entertainment was criticized when a copy protection mechanism known as Extended Copy Protection (XCP) used on some of their audio CDs automatically and surreptitiously installed copy-prevention software on computers (see 2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal). Such discs are not legally allowed to be called CDs or Compact Discs because they break the Red Book standard governing CDs, and Amazon.com for example describes them as \"copy protected discs\" rather than \"compact discs\" or \"CDs\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8560", "title": "Design", "text": "Design\n\nDesign is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object, system or measurable human interaction. Design has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below). In some cases, the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, coding, and graphic design) is also considered to use design thinking.\n\nDesigning often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic, and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable research, thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, products, skyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes, and even methods or processes of designing.\n\nThus \"design\" may be a substantive referring to a categorical abstraction of a created thing or things (the design of something), or a verb for the process of creation as is made clear by grammatical context.\n\nMore formally design has been defined as follows:\nAnother definition for design is \"a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation. It defines the specifications, plans, parameters, costs, activities, processes and how and what to do within legal, political, social, environmental, safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective.\"\n\nHere, a \"specification\" can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product, and \"primitives\" are the elements from which the design object is composed.\n\nThe person designing is called a designer, which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a textile designer, fashion designer, product designer, concept designer, web designer or interior designer). A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process while the scientific study of design is called design science.\n\nAnother definition of design is planning to manufacture an object, system, component or structure. Thus the word \"design\" can be used as a noun or a verb. In a broader sense, design is an applied art and engineering that integrates with technology.\n\nWhile the definition of design is fairly broad, design has a myriad of specifications that professionals utilize in their fields.\n\nMajor examples of design are architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns\n\nSubstantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields, whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs. Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis, both designers themselves, argued that \"there are many ways of describing design processes\" and discussed \"two basic and fundamentally different ways\", both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called \"the rational model\", \"technical problem solving\" and \"the reason-centric perspective\". The alternative view has been called \"reflection-in-action\", \"evolutionary design\", \"co-evolution\", and \"the action-centric perspective\".\n\nThe rational model was independently developed by Herbert A. Simon, an American scientist, and Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz, two German engineering design theorists. It posits that:\n\nThe rational model is based on a rationalist philosophy and underlies the waterfall model, systems development life cycle, and much of the engineering design literature. According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner.\n\nTypical stages consistent with the rational model include the following:\n\nEach stage has many associated best practices.\n\nThe rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds:\n\n\nThe action-centric perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts, which are antithetical to the rational model. It posits that:\n\n\nThe action-centric perspective is based on an empiricist philosophy and broadly consistent with the agile approach and amethodical development. Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers. Like the rational model, the action-centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge. However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers – by designers \"thinking on their feet\" – more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the rational model.\n\nAt least two views of design activity are consistent with the action-centric perspective. Both involve three basic activities.\n\nIn the reflection-in-action paradigm, designers alternate between \"framing\", \"making moves\", and \"evaluating moves\". \"Framing\" refers to conceptualizing the problem, i.e., defining goals and objectives. A \"move\" is a tentative design decision. The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design.\n\nIn the sensemaking–coevolution–implementation framework, designers alternate between its three titular activities. Sensemaking includes both framing and evaluating moves. Implementation is the process of constructing the design object. Coevolution is \"the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context, and vice versa\".\n\nThe concept of the design cycle is understood as a circular time structure, which may start with the thinking of an idea, then expressing it by the use of visual or verbal means of communication (design tools), the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea, and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea. Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression, which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas.\n\nThere are countless philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought and among practicing designers. Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. A design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of the smallest element, to the most holistic influential utopian goals. Design goals are usually for guiding design. However, conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to questioning the purpose of design, perhaps to set better long term or ultimate goals. John Heskett, a 20th-century British writer on design claimed, \"Design, stripped to its essence, can be defined as the human nature to shape and make our environment in ways without precedent in nature, to serve our needs and give meaning to our lives.\"\n\nDesign philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. Reflections on material culture and environmental concerns (sustainable design) can guide a design philosophy. One example is the First Things First manifesto which was launched within the graphic design community and states \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication – a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design.\"\n\nIn \"The Sciences of the Artificial\" by polymath Herbert A. Simon, the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. \"Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process of design.\"\n\nA design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer. A combination of approaches may be used if they don't conflict.\n\nSome popular approaches include:\n\nDesign methods is a broad area that focuses on:\n\nThe word \"design\" is often considered ambiguous, as it is applied in varying contexts.\nToday, the term design is widely associated with the applied arts as initiated by Raymond Loewy and teachings at the Bauhaus and Ulm School of Design (HfG Ulm) in Germany during the 20th century.\n\nThe boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. Applied arts has been used as an umbrella term to define fields of industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, etc. The term 'decorative arts' is a traditional term used in historical discourses to describe craft objects, and also sits within the umbrella of applied arts. In graphic arts (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration), the distinction is often made between fine art and commercial art, based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded.\n\nTo a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across the disciplines within the applied arts and fine art. Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the principles of design are \"almost instinctive\", \"built-in\", \"natural\", and part of \"our sense of 'rightness'.\" However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.\n\nIn engineering, design is a component of the engineering process. Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing Product design, Industrial design and Engineering. The American Heritage Dictionary defines design as: \"To conceive or fashion in the mind; invent,\" and \"To formulate a plan\", and defines engineering as: \"The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems.\". Both are forms of problem-solving with a defined distinction being the application of \"scientific and mathematical principles\". The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised the importance of more new \"human-centered\" fields of design. How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered \"science\". Along with the question of what is considered science, there is social science versus natural science. Scientists at Xerox PARC made the distinction of design versus engineering at \"moving minds\" versus \"moving atoms\" (probably in contradiction to the origin of term \"engineering - engineer\" from Latin \"in genio\" in meaning of a \"genius\" what assumes existence of a \"mind\" not of an \"atom\").\n\nThe relationship between design and production is one of planning and executing. In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and creativity. In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process. A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary or impractical to expect a designer with a broad multidisciplinary knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed specialized knowledge of how to produce the product.\n\nDesign and production are intertwined in many creative professional careers, meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a skyscraper, requires separating (design) architecture from (production) construction. A Low-budget project, such as a locally printed office party invitation flyer, can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hour's pay of a desktop publisher.\n\nThis is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position (e.g. production artist, construction worker) with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition (copy) of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer.\n\n\"Process design\" (in contrast to \"design process\" mentioned above) refers to the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result. Processes (in general) are treated as a product of design, not the method of design. The term originated with the industrial designing of chemical processes. With the increasing complexities of the information age, consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the design of business processes as well as manufacturing processes.\n\n\n"}

He moved to Los Angeles, California, following the end of the war.\n\nOnce in Los Angeles, Bell began working as a marketer and licensing agent for the Walt Disney Company.

The concept for Woodsy Owl was developed on the set of \"Lassie\". Bell teamed with three other Lassie teachnical advisors - United States Forest Service rangers, Chuck Williams and Glenn Kovar, and colleague Betty Hite - to create Woodsy Owl as the new mascot for the United States Forest Service for the first Earth Day in 1970.\n\nThe United States Forest Service had requested that Bell and the others develop a new message and symbol for the agency. A number of other animals were considered as the mascot, including a ladybug, rainbow trout, elk and raccoon. An owl was ultimately chosen because of the belief that owls are wise, can see polluters from treetop perches, and can live near cities and towns. Bell and the others envisioned Woodsy Owl with a broad mission, unlike Smokey Bear, who focused almost exclusively on forest fire prevention. The owl would be used to advocate environmental programs and urge American children to fight pollution and help the environment. Woodsy Owl became most famous for his motto, \"Give a hoot, Don’t pollute\". As of 2009, the character now uses the slogan, \"Help Woodsy Spread the Word\", mixed with the song, \"The Syncopated Clock\", by Leroy Anderson.\n\n"}

{"id": "41481285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41481285", "title": "History of accounting", "text": "History of accounting\n\nThe history of accounting or accountancy is thousands of years old and can be traced to ancient civilizations.\n\nThe early development of accounting dates back to ancient Mesopotamia, and is closely related to developments in writing, counting and money and early auditing systems by the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians. By the time of the Roman Empire, the government had access to detailed financial information.\n\nIn India Chanakya wrote a manuscript similar to a financial management book, during the period of the Mauryan Empire. His book \"Arthashasthra\" contains few detailed aspects of maintaining books of accounts for a Sovereign State.\n\nThe Italian Luca Pacioli, recognized as \"The Father of accounting and bookkeeping\" was the first person to publish a work on double-entry bookkeeping, and introduced the field in Italy.\n\nThe modern profession of the chartered accountant originated in Scotland in the nineteenth century. Accountants often belonged to the same associations as solicitors, who often offered accounting services to their clients. Early modern accounting had similarities to today's forensic accounting. Accounting began to transition into an organized profession in the nineteenth century, with local professional bodies in England merging to form the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1880.\n\nAccounting records dating back more than 7,000 years have been found in Mesopotamia, and documents from ancient Mesopotamia show lists of expenditures, and goods received and traded. The development of accounting, along with that of money and numbers, may be related to the taxation and trading activities of temples: \"another part of the explanation as to why accounting employs the numerical metaphor is [...] that money, numbers and accounting are interrelated and, perhaps, inseparable in their origins: all emerged in the context of controlling goods, stocks and transactions in the temple economy of Mesopotamia.\"\n\nThe early development of accounting was closely related to developments in writing, counting, and money. In particular, there is evidence that a key step in the development of counting—the transition from concrete to abstract counting—was related to the early development of accounting and money and took place in Mesopotamia\n\nOther early accounting records were also found in the ruins of ancient Babylon, Assyria and Sumeria, which date back more than 7,000 years. The people of that time relied on primitive accounting methods to record the growth of crops and herds. Because there was a natural season to farming and herding, it was easy to count and determine if a surplus had been gained after the crops had been harvested or the young animals weaned.\n\nBetween the 4th millennium BC and the 3rd millennium BC, the ruling leaders and priests in ancient Iran had people oversee financial matters. In Godin Tepe (گدین تپه) and Tepe Yahya (تپه يحيی), cylindrical tokens that were used for bookkeeping on clay scripts were found in buildings that had large rooms for storage of crops. In Godin Tepe's findings, the scripts only contained tables with figures, while in Tepe Yahya's findings, the scripts also contained graphical representations. The invention of a form of bookkeeping using clay tokens represented a huge cognitive leap for mankind.\n\nDuring the 2nd millennium BC, the expansion of commerce and business expanded the role of the accountant. The Phoenicians invented a phonetic alphabet \"probably for bookkeeping purposes\", based on the Egyptian hieratic script, and there is evidence that an individual in ancient Egypt held the title \"comptroller of the scribes\". There is also evidence for an early form of accounting in the Old Testament; for example the Book of Exodus describes Moses engaging Ithamar to account for the materials that had been contributed towards the building of the tabernacle.\n\nBy about the 4th century BC, the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians had auditing systems for checking movement in and out of storehouses, including oral \"audit reports\", resulting in the term \"auditor\" (from \"audire\", \"to hear\" in Latin) importance of taxation had created a need for the recording of payments, and the Rosetta Stone also includes a description of a tax revolt.\n\nBy the time of Emperor Augustus (63 BC - AD 14), the Roman government had access to detailed financial information as evidenced by the \"Res Gestae Divi Augusti\" (Latin: \"The Deeds of the Divine Augustus\"). The inscription was an account to the Roman people of the Emperor Augustus' stewardship, and listed and quantified his public expenditure, including distributions to the people, grants of land or money to army veterans, subsidies to the \"aerarium\" (treasury), building of temples, religious offerings, and expenditures on theatrical shows and gladiatorial games, covering a period of about forty years. The scope of the accounting information at the emperor's disposal suggests that its purpose encompassed planning and decision-making.\n\nThe Roman historians Suetonius and Cassius Dio record that in 23 BC, Augustus prepared a \"rationarium\" (account) which listed public revenues, the amounts of cash in the \"aerarium\" (treasury), in the provincial \"fisci\" (tax officials), and in the hands of the \"publicani\" (public contractors); and that it included the names of the freedmen and slaves from whom a detailed account could be obtained. The closeness of this information to the executive authority of the emperor is attested by Tacitus' statement that it was written out by Augustus himself.\n\nRecords of cash, commodities, and transactions were kept scrupulously by military personnel of the Roman army. An account of small cash sums received over a few days at the fort of Vindolanda circa AD 110 shows that the fort could compute revenues in cash on a daily basis, perhaps from sales of surplus supplies or goods manufactured in the camp, items dispensed to slaves such as \"cervesa\" (beer) and \"clavi caligares\" (nails for boots), as well as commodities bought by individual soldiers. The basic needs of the fort were met by a mixture of direct production, purchase and requisition; in one letter, a request for money to buy 5,000 \"modii\" (measures) of \"braces\" (a cereal used in brewing) shows that the fort bought provisions for a considerable number of people.\n\nThe Heroninos Archive is the name given to a huge collection of papyrus documents, mostly letters, but also including a fair number of accounts, which come from Roman Egypt in 3rd century AD. The bulk of the documents relate to the running of a large, private estate is named after Heroninos because he was \"phrontistes\" (Koine Greek: manager) of the estate which had a complex and standardised system of accounting which was followed by all its local farm managers. Each administrator on each sub-division of the estate drew up his own little accounts, for the day-to-day running of the estate, payment of the workforce, production of crops, the sale of produce, the use of animals, and general expenditure on the staff. This information was then summarized as pieces of papyrus scroll into one big yearly account for each particular sub-division of the estate. Entries were arranged by sector, with cash expenses and gains extrapolated from all the different sectors. Accounts of this kind gave the owner the opportunity to take better economic decisions because the information was purposefully selected and arranged.\n\nWhen medieval Europe moved towards a monetary economy in the 13th century, sedentary merchants depended on bookkeeping to oversee multiple simultaneous transactions financed by bank loans. One important breakthrough took place around that time: the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping, which is defined as any bookkeeping system in which there was a debit and credit entry for each transaction, or for which the majority of transactions were intended to be of this form. The historical origin of the use of the words \"debit\" and \"credit\" in accounting goes back to the days of single-entry bookkeeping, which had as its chief objective keeping track of amounts owed by customers (debtors) and amounts owed to creditors. \"Debit\" in Latin means \"he owes\" and \"credit\" in Latin means \"he trusts\".\n\nDouble-entry bookkeeping was pioneered in the Jewish community of the early-medieval Middle East. Jewish bankers in Old Cairo, for example, used a double-entry bookkeeping system which predated the known usage of such a form in Italy, and whose records remain from the 11th century AD, found amongst the Cairo Geniza. It has been hypothesized that Italian merchants likely learned the method from their interaction with medieval Jewish merchants from the Middle East, however this question remains an area for further research. The earliest extant evidence of full double-entry bookkeeping appears in the Farolfi ledger of 1299-1300. Giovanno Farolfi & Company, a firm of Florentine merchants headquartered in Nîmes, acted as moneylenders to the Archbishop of Arles, their most important customer. The oldest discovered record of a complete double-entry system is the \"Messari\" (Italian: Treasurer's) accounts of the city of Genoa in 1340. The \"Messari\" accounts contain debits and credits journalised in a bilateral form and carry forward balances from the preceding year, and therefore enjoy general recognition as a double-entry system.\n\nRagusan economist Benedetto Cotrugli's 1458 treatise \"Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto\" contained the earliest known manuscript of a double-entry bookkeeping system. His manuscript was first published in 1573.\n\nLuca Pacioli's \"Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalità\" (early Italian: \"Review of Arithmetic, Geometry, Ratio and Proportion\") was first printed and published in Venice in 1494. It included a 27-page treatise on bookkeeping, \"Particularis de Computis et Scripturis\" (Latin: \"Details of Calculation and Recording\"). Pacioli wrote primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a source of pleasure from the mathematical puzzles it contained, and to aid the education of their sons. His work represents the first known printed treatise on bookkeeping; and it is widely believed to be the forerunner of modern bookkeeping practice. In \"Summa de arithmetica\", Pacioli introduced symbols for plus and minus for the first time in a printed book, symbols which became standard notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. \"Summa de arithmetica\" was also the first known book printed in Italy to contain algebra.\n\nRagusan economist Benedetto Cotrugli's 1458 treatise \"Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto\" contained the earliest known manuscript of a double-entry bookkeeping system, however Cotrugli's manuscript was not officially published until 1573. In fact even at the time of writing his work in 1494 Pacoili was aware of Cotrugli’s efforts and credited Cortrugli with the origination of the double entry book keeping system.\n\nAlthough Luca Pacioli did not invent double-entry bookkeeping, his 27-page treatise on bookkeeping contained the first known published work on that topic, and is said to have laid the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping as it is practiced today. Even though Pacioli's treatise exhibits almost no originality, it is generally considered as an important work, mainly because of its wide circulation; it was written in the vernacular Italian language, and it was a printed book.\n\nPacioli saw accounting as an \"ad-hoc\" ordering system devised by the merchant. Its regular use provides the merchant with continued information about his business, and allows him to evaluate how things are going and to act accordingly. Pacioli recommends the Venetian method of double-entry bookkeeping above all others. Three major books of account are at the direct basis of this system:\n\n\nThe ledger classes as the central document and is accompanied by an alphabetical index.\n\nPacioli's treatise gave instructions on recording barter transactions and transactions in a variety of currencies – both of which were far more common than today. It also enabled merchants to audit their own books and to ensure that the entries in the accounting records made by their bookkeepers complied with the method he described. Without such a system, all merchants who did not maintain their own records were at greater risk of theft by their employees and agents: it is not by accident that the first and last items described in his treatise concern maintenance of an accurate inventory.\n\nAccounting as it developed in Renaissance Europe also had moral and religious connotations, recalling the judgment of souls and the audit of sin.\n\nThe development of joint-stock companies (especially from about 1600) built wider audiences for accounting information, as investors without first-hand knowledge of their operations relied on accounts to provide the requisite information. This development resulted in a split of accounting systems for internal (i.e. management accounting) and external (i.e. financial accounting) purposes, and subsequently also in accounting and disclosure regulations and a growing need for independent attestation of external accounts by auditors.\n\nModern Accounting is a product of centuries of thought, custom, habit, action and convention. Two concepts have formed the current state of the accountancy profession. Firstly, the development of the double-entry book-keeping system in the fourteenth and fifteenth century and secondly, accountancy professionalization which was created in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The modern profession of the chartered accountant originated in Scotland in the nineteenth century. During this time, accountants often belonged to the same associations as solicitors, and the latter solicitors sometimes offered accounting services to their clients. Early modern accounting had similarities to today's forensic accounting:\n\nIn July 1854 The Institute of Accountants in Glasgow petitioned Queen Victoria for a Royal Charter. The Petition, signed by 49 Glasgow accountants, argued that the profession of accountancy had long existed in Scotland as a distinct profession of great respectability, and that although the number of practitioners had been originally few, the number had been rapidly increasing. The petition also pointed out that accountancy required a varied group of skills; as well as mathematical skills for calculation, the accountant had to have an acquaintance with the general principles of the legal system as they were frequently employed by the courts to give evidence on financial matters. The Edinburgh Society of accountants adopted the name \"Chartered Accountant\" for members.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, Britain's Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and London was the financial centre of the world. With the growth of the limited liability company and large scale manufacturing and logistics, demand surged for more technically proficient accountants capable of handling the increasingly complex world of high speed global transactions, able to calculate figures like asset depreciation and inventory valuation and cognizant of the latest changes in legislation such as the new Company law, then being introduced. As companies proliferated, the demand for reliable accountancy shot up, and the profession rapidly became an integral part of the business and financial system.\n\nTo improve their status and combat criticism of low standards, local professional bodies in England amalgamated to form the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, established by royal charter in 1880. Initially with just under 600 members, the newly formed institute expanded rapidly; it soon drew up standards of conduct and examinations for admission and members were authorised to use the professional designations \"FCA\" (Fellow Chartered Accountant), for a firm partner and \"ACA\" (Associate Chartered Accountant) for a qualified member of an accountant's staff. In the United States the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants was established in 1887.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In both contexts, the term has expanded to include items made of steel, aluminium, brass, or other metals, as well as plastics.\n\nThe term ironmonger as a supplier of consumer goods is still widely used in Great Britain, the US equivalent being \"hardware store\". Many architectural ironmongery items (for example, door handles, locks, hinges, etc.) are also manufactured for wholesale and commercial use in offices and other buildings.\n\nDealing in ironware has a long tradition, dating back to the first recorded use of the metal to fashion useful objects as long ago as 1200 BC, and studying the movement of such goods around the world, often over long distances, has provided valuable insight into early societies and trading patterns.\n\nBy the Middle Ages, skilled metalworkers were highly prized for their ability to create a wide range of things, from weaponry, tools and implements to more humble domestic items, and the local blacksmith remained the principal source of ironmongery until the Industrial Revolution saw the introduction of mass production from the late 18th century. In the areas where ironware and nails were manufactured, particularly the Black Country, an ironmonger was a manufacturer operating under the domestic system, who put out iron to smiths, nailers, or other metal workers, and then organised the distribution of the finished products to retailers.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Victorian ironmongery offered a treasurehouse of appealing metalwork, with elaborate manufacturers’ catalogues offering literally thousands of objects to meet each and every need, almost all of which sought to combine practicality with pleasing design.\nThe second half of the 20th century saw the steady decline of ironmongers’ shops. Although every small town in Britain used to have at least one, their fate has mirrored that of many traditional emporia. The number of ironmongers has fallen dramatically with the advent of DIY superstores that offer a complete range of ironmongery and associated products under one roof, and more recently the arrival of comprehensive mail order catalogues and internet suppliers.\n\nHowever, there has been a simultaneous revival in the fortunes of old-style hand-forged ironmongery, with strong interest in the authentic restoration of period homes leading to demand for items such as traditional iron door handles, door knobs, door knockers, letter plates, locks, hinges, hooks, cabinet fittings and window furniture. There has even been renewed use of “blacksmith nails” – four-sided hand-made rosehead nails. This is typical of a trend that has seen greater appreciation of designs that have stood the test of time, that has allowed hand-forged ironmongery to find a much wider application than use in property restoration – although the practice of incorporating traditional ironmongery into contemporary housing has been helped by thoroughly modern techniques like galvanising and powder coating to inhibit rust.\n\nIn some areas, \"ironmonger\" is also slang for an arms dealer, giving rise to numerous fictional characters by the name.\n\n"}

He married her immediately after her divorce from the 9th Duke of Marlborough in 1921. \n\nBalsan was born on September 16, 1868 in Châteauroux, France. He was the son of Auguste Balsan and Marie (née Dupuytren). Among his siblings was brother was Étienne Balsan, the first patron of Coco Chanel, and sister, Viscountess Villeneuve de Bargemont of Davenescourt, France.\n\nThrough his mother, he was descended from Guillaume Dupuytren, the anatomist and surgeon who treated Napoleon Bonaparte and, today, is best known today for his description of Dupuytren's contracture, which is named after him and which he first operated on in 1831 and published in \"The Lancet\" in 1834.\n\nJacques Balsan came from a manufacturing family who created and run Balsan (Company) which supplied the French Army with uniforms from the time of Napoleon onwards which were the origin of the famous cloth \"the blue horizon\". The family's textile factories were situated at Châteauroux. \nAt the age of 24, Jacques Balsan entered the family business and traveled the world, buying wool. \n\nPassionate about ballooning, in September 1900, while in the balloon \"St. Louis\" that was inflated with illuminating gas, he remained aloft for 39 hours and nine minutes. Later that same month, he earned the record for the highest altitude flight at the \"Exposition Universelle\", by rising to a height of 8,558 meters; the following month traveling over 1,345 kilometers (roughly 850 miles) from Vincennes to Opoezno, Russia.\n\nA pioneer of flying, he bought his first aircraft in 1905, a Chanute-type glider, and an airplane in 1909 and obtained a Number 22 licence to pilot aircraft. He also took part in aviation experiments with the Wright brothers in Biarritz and in 1910, constructed his own small plane. In February 1910, in his Blériot monoplane, he won the \"Le Prix d'Héliopolis\" (in Egypt).\n\nDuring World War I, he helped organize the Lafayette Escadrille along with William K. Vanderbilt and Dr. Edmund Gros, also a founder of the American Hospital of Paris and organizer of the American Ambulance Field Service. Later, General Maunoury gave him charge of the aerial reconnaissance of the site of the First Battle of the Marne. In 1918, he went to London as chief of the French Air Force mission. By the end of the War, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant colonel. \n\nDuring World War II, he joined the Free French forces in London, taking part in the operations that liberated southern France.\n\nBalsan first saw and immediately fell in love with wealthy American, Consuelo Vanderbilt, when she was 17, before her marriage to the 9th Duke of Marlborough. She was considered the most eligible woman of the late Victorian Age. A memorable portrait of her by Carolus Duran hangs at Blenheim Palace. Balsan married her on 4 July 1921 (when he was 52 and she was 44), after which she was styled 'Mme Jacques Balsan', until her death in 1964. Known for his attentions to her, it was a very happy marriage. Consuelo wrote to her close friend Winston Churchill, during World War II, while Jacques worked with the Free French in London, to request his special protection and safe return. Winston obligingly facilitated his safe return to America.\n\nThe Balsans were hosting Winston and Clementine Churchill in September 1939, just before the outbreak of war at their chateau Saint-Georges-Motel, near Dreux north of Paris. They also owned a property in Èze (Alpes-Maritimes) where they received a number of celebrities such as the Duke of Connaught, son of Queen Victoria, The Maharajah de Kapurthala and Charlie Chaplin. Balsan supported his wife's work with French children. They lived in their \"hotel particulier\" in Paris, 9 avenue Charles-Floquet.\n\nConsuelo Vanderbilt's ghosted autobiography \"The Glitter and The Gold\" refers to her time with Balsan as \"gold\", as opposed to the \"glitter\" of her earlier, aristocratic marriage. In it, she tells the story of the Balsans' daring escape from the Nazis through Spain to Portugal and eventually to America, where they lived for the rest of their lives.\n\nJacques Balsan died on November 4, 1956 at his home, 1 Sutton Place, New York City, in America. His death occurred less than a month after his stepson, Lord Ivor Churchill, died, at the age of 57, in London on September 17, 1956. Balsan was buried in Paris. His widow died on December 6, 1964 at her home in Southampton, New York and was buried next to Lord Ivor.\n\n\n"}

Matheson is estimated to be Ireland's 4th–largest corporate law firm, and Europe's 27th–largest corporate law firm (by revenue). Matheson state in the that their tax department is: \"significantly the largest tax practice group amongst Irish law firms\".\n\nWhile Matheson's website traces their history back to 1825 and that their offices were burnt in the Irish Easter Rising of 1916, it wasn't until after the creation and initial development of Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (or IFSC) that Matheson Ormsby Prentice (or \"MOPs\", as it was called) emerged as a small but standalone law firm with 14 partners and over 50 solicitors (or lawyers) in 1991. It moved to its current IFSC offices, 70 Sir John Rodgerson's Quay in 2007, and rebranded to \"Matheson\" in October 2012. \n\nWhile A&L Goodbody and Arthur Cox still lead Irish corporate law, Matheson has grown with the rise in the IFSC to become one of Ireland's \"big four\" corporate law firms (with McCannFitzgerald). Matheson focuses on the two legal areas most associated with the IFSC, namely tax structuring for U.S. multinationals (e.g. Microsoft, Google, Pepsi, all Matheson clients), and creating IFSC–domiciled corporate tax structures and tax efficient vehicles for various asset management and asset financing activities (particularly securitisation special purpose vehicles, which the IFSC leads in the EU–28).\n\nIn 2013 Matheson founded the Irish Debt Securities Association (or IDSA), which acts as the industry lobby group for the Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) (the IFSC's main securitisation structure). Like Feargal O'Rourke in PriceWaterhouseCoopers (Ireland IFSC), Matheson has been an active lobbyist for expanding various Irish legal structures and amending taxation controls to help grow the IFSC, which can lead to conflict. Matheson's leadership in IFSC tax structures (or IP–based BEPS tools, and Debt–based BEPS tools), makes makes them a noted industry commentator.\n\nMatheson's leadership in the area of U.S. multinational tax planning in Ireland, a jurisdiction which is ranked as one of the world's top corporate havens (see corporate tax haven lists), has seen Matheson win major awards from the international corporate tax planning industry, including:\n\nMatheson's leadership in the Irish tax strategies of U.S. multinationals, (or BEPS tools), has attracted attention from U.S. media over the years. In 2005, the Wall Street Journal ran a story on how Microsoft used an Irish subsidiary called \"Round Ireland One\" to avoid billions in U.S. taxes which was structured and registered in Matheson's offices (was then Matheson Ormsby Prentice, or MOPS). In 2013 the Wall Street Journal ran another investigation showing that the scale of U.S. operations in Ireland, using Matheson registered tax structures, had dramatically increased from 2005. These strategies has seen Ireland labelled as one of the world's largest corporate tax havens, and blacklisted by Brazil.\n\nLike other tax law firms in the International Financial Services Centre, Matheson has openly marketed IP–based BEPS tools with effective tax rates of under 3%.\n\nMainstream U.S. media channels have singled out Matheson in Dublin, as a significant centre for U.S. multinational tax strategies.\n\nIn this regard, Matheson is akin to the situation of Irish PwC Managing Partner Feargal O'Rourke, whose development of the double Irish IP–based BEPS tool, has also made him the subject of investigative pieces by the U.S. financial media. Bloomberg recognise that O'Rourke, while being at the vanguard of legitimate but aggressive U.S. multinational tax planning, is considered a \"hero\" in Ireland.\n\nIn 2016, Matheson was criticised in the Irish media when it was revealed that U.S. distressed debt funds (known pejoratively as \"vulture funds\" in the Irish media), had used the services of Irish International Financial Services Centre securitisation law firms to avoid billions in Irish taxes, on Irish distressed assets by using Irish Section 110 SPVs. These structures were created so IFSC law firms could administer global securitisation transactions. Matheson featured as one of the most frequently used advisors by the U.S. distressed debt funds (with A&L Goodbody).\n\nThe affair escalated into the \"vulture fund tax avoidance\" scandal, when it was found Matheson used three in-house children's charities (Eurydice, Medb and Badb), to make the Irish Section 110 SPV work in an Irish domestic setting (known as \"orphaning\"). This was a purpose for which Finance Minister Michael Noonan acknowledged \"the Section 110 legislation was not set up for\". The affair became a major Irish scandal and was reported in the international media. The Irish State closed the loopholes, and prohibit Irish charities from being used in tax avoidance structures.\n\nIt was revealed in the Irish section of the panama papers leak of 2016, that a Senior Matheson Partner, Stanley Watson, had established an offshore tax structure with Mossack Fonseca's help in Cyprus, to reduce his tax bill on moving to London to set up the Matheson London office. A woman in the Matheson Dublin office, was helping handle the correspondence to establish the structure.. The affair caused further embarrassment for Matheson when Stanley Watson's Isle of Man advisor was recorded as describing Matheson to Mossack Fonseca as \"our biggest client\".\n\n\n"}

Organizations register with Mitzvah Day, which in turn helps match volunteers with local projects. The objective is to encourage people to give their time, rather than their money, to worthwhile local causes, whilst also creating deeper linkages within communities and supporting charities. In 2013, close to 30,000 people participated in Mitzvah Day around the world.\nThough based within the UK's Jewish Community, Mitzvah Day traditionally marks the first day of UK National Inter Faith Week, and as a result has expanded to include participants from other faith communities as well.\n'Mitzvah' is the Hebrew biblical term for 'deed' or 'commandment', which has come to mean 'good deed' or 'charitable act' in contemporary English.\n\nThe 2017 date is November 19.\n\nMitzvah Day International was founded by Laura Marks in 2005, who, upon returning to her native UK from a period spent in Los Angeles, decided to bring the 'Mitzvah Day' concept she became familiar with through the Temple Israel of Hollywood synagogue back to the UK. Though the Mitzvah Day she was familiar with (and most Mitzvah Days in the US) was based around a single community or congregation, her concept for Mitzvah Day in the UK was to unite Jewish community and other groups around a single coordinated day of social action across the country.

In 2011, he donated 10 million birr (US$500k) to the proposed Ethiopian National Coffee Museum in Ethiopia’s Kaffa Zone.\n\nIn September 2011, in response to an appeal from Prime Minister Meles Zenawi for popular support for the financing of the Renaissance Dam in North West Ethiopia which will triple the country’s hydro-electric power, Al Amoudi pledged a donation of 1.5bn birr (around US$88m).\n\nOn 4 November, 2017, Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi was kidnapped upon the orders of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman(MBS) and detained in Saudi Arabia in a supposed \"corruption crackdown\" conducted by Mohammed Bin Salman's royal anti-corruption committee. This was done on the authority of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman. Al-Amoudi has not been seen since his abduction and detention, and it is feared that he is being tortured to force him to transfer his wealth to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. It is also possible that he could have been murdered. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had tried to secure his release, but was unsuccessful.\n\nAl Amoudi has committed funds to support healthcare and sport in Saudi Arabia, the US, Europe and Africa. He funded a breast cancer research centre at King Abdulaziz University.\n\nIn 2008, Al Amoudi funded King Saud University’s an enhanced oil recovery research chair. He also fully funded the King Abdullah Institute for Nanotechnology at King Saud University.\n\nAl Amoudi was named as one of the William J. Clinton Foundation Donors, according to information released as part of an obligation placed on former President Clinton when he supported Hillary Clinton's nomination as Secretary of State. He is reported to have donated between US$5m and US$10m to the foundation.\n\nAl Amoudi sponsored the CECAFA Cup, Africa's oldest football cup competition, in 2005 and 2006, the tournament was named the Al Amoudi Senior Challenge Cup as a result in those years. He also supports Ethiopian Premier League Club Saint George S.C. and covered the medical expenses of one of Ethiopia’s most celebrated footballers, Mengistu Worku, before his death in December 2010. In 2011, he pledged 100 million Ethiopian birr for a stadium and access road in Mek'ele. In January 2017, The Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Ali Al-Amoudi Stadium was opened. The Stadium reportedly cost more than $22 million, and took four and a half years to complete.\n\nIn December 2010 Al Amoudi initiated a claim in the English High Court against Elias Kifle of the Washington, D.C.-based \"Ethiopian Review\" claiming damages for libel. In July 2011 Kifle was ordered to pay £175,000 in damages for publishing false information.\n\nThe \"Ethiopian Review\" had also repeated unwarranted material relating to his family and to matters previously dealt with in the \"Al Amoudi v. Brisard\" case of 2005. M. Brisard had made serious and unwarranted allegations concerning engagement in the funding of terrorism in the wake of 9/11 but had subsequently apologised for the accusation. The judge found the statements to be untrue and stated that Al Amoudi \"is implacably opposed to terrorism in all its forms”.\n\nAl Amoudi has been ranked among the 100 richest people by \"Forbes\" since 2006, being ranking 82nd on the list in 2015. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Addis Ababa University and has been honoured with the Order of the Polar Star by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.\n\nAl Amoudi was honoured for his achievements in economics and philanthropy at the 19th Arab Economic Forum Summit in 2011, with special reference to his commitment to sustainable development.\n\nAl Amoudi was born in the north-central Ethiopian city of Dessie, in Wollo region and brought up in Woldia, a town also in Wollo, Ethiopia. He was born to a father of Hadhrami Yemeni origin and an Ethiopian mother of Wollo Amhara descent. He grew up in Ethiopia, before emigrating to Saudi Arabia with his brother Mauricet and becoming a Saudi citizen.\n\nAccording to the \"BBC\", Al Amoudi splits his residence between central London, Surrey and Saudi Arabia. He is married to Soniat Saleh Selassie Al Amoudi, an Ethiopian and shareholder of MIDROC Construction. They have eight children.\n\n"}

{"id": "10745460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10745460", "title": "Samuel Mason", "text": "Samuel Mason\n\nSamuel Ross Mason also, spelled Meason (November 8, 1739 – 1803) was a Virginia militia captain, on the American western frontier, during the American Revolutionary War. After the war, he became the leader of the Mason Gang, a criminal gang of river pirates and highwaymen on the lower Ohio River and the Mississippi River in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was associated with outlaws around Red Banks, Cave-in-Rock, Stack Island, and the Natchez Trace.\n\nMason was born in Norfolk, Virginia, and raised in what is now Charles Town, West Virginia, formerly a part of Virginia. According to Lyman Draper, in the 1750s Mason got his earliest start in crime as a teenager, by stealing the horses of Colonel John L. Hite, in Frederick County, Virginia, being wounded and caught by his pursuers. He moved from Charles Town to what is now Ohio County, West Virginia, also at that time a part of Virginia, in 1773.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Samuel Mason was a captain, of the Ohio County Militia, Virginia State Forces. According to Ohio County court minutes, dated January 7, 1777, Mason was recommended to Patrick Henry, the Governor of Virginia, to serve as captain of the militia. On January 28, he was present and cited as a captain from Ohio county at a \"council of war\" held at Catfish Camp. Catfish Camp was located at or near present-day Washington, Pennsylvania. On June 8, 1777, Mason wrote a letter from Fort Henry, Virginia, now present-day Wheeling, West Virginia, to brigadier general Edward Hand, at Fort Pitt, now present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The letter he wrote was signed Samuel Meason. On September 1, 1777, Captain Mason was wounded but survived an ambush by Native Americans, near Fort Henry. Most of the men in his Virginia Militia company perished during the attack. From August 11-September 14, 1779 Samuel Mason while at Fort Henry accompanied Colonel Daniel Brodhead and his 8th Pennsylvania Regiment of the Continental Army combined with militia troops from Fort Pitt to destroy ten tribal villages of the pro-British Seneca tribe in northeastern Pennsylvania during the Sullivan Expedition in retaliation for the devastating Iroquois attacks in the Cobleskill, Wyoming Valley and Cherry Valley massacres of 1778. According to court martial records in Ohio County, Virginia, Captain Mason was still on duty as an officer in the Ohio County, Virginia Militia at Fort Henry until 1781. He appeared at the court martials and was present as a witness for military proceedings against other soldiers. Samuel Mason appeared twice at the Ohio County courthouse in Wheeling on November 7, 1780 and May 7, 1781.\n\nIn his book, \"The Outlaws of Cave-In-Rock\", Otto A. Rothert stated that Samuel Mason moved again, in 1779, to a part of Virginia, east of Wheeling that is now in present-day Washington County, Pennsylvania, where he was elected justice of the peace and later selected as an associate judge, leaving for an area that was then a part of Virginia and now the present-day State of Kentucky, in 1784. Mason's surname was spelled interchangeably as Meason in many of the early frontier records. This is explained in two family histories of the Mason/Meason family, \"Pioneer Period and Pioneer People of Fairfield County, Ohio\" by C. M. L. Wiseman, dated 1901, and \"Torrence and Allied Families\" by Robert M. Torrence, dated 1938.\n\nIn the early 1790s, Samuel Mason moved his family to the Red Banks on the Ohio River, now Henderson, Kentucky, where he began his full-time criminal activities. He later settled downriver on Diamond Island and engaged in river piracy. By 1797, Mason moved the base of his operations further downriver to Cave-in-Rock on the Illinois side of the river in the Northwest Territory. The Mason Gang of river pirates openly based themselves at the prominent Ohio River landmark known as Cave-in-Rock, a huge shelter cave. Samuel Mason had a brief association with the first known serial killers in America, Micajah and Wiley Harpe, as well as Peter Alston, and possibly John Duff, the counterfeiter. Mason and his gang stayed at Cave-In-Rock until the summer of 1799, when they were expelled by the \"Exterminators\", a group of regulators under the leadership of Captain Young of Mercer County, Kentucky. Samuel Mason moved his operations down the Mississippi River and settled his family in the territory of Spanish Louisiana, now the present-day state of Missouri, and became a highwayman along the Natchez Trace in Mississippi Territory, now the present-day state of Mississippi. It was on the Natchez Trace that Mason received his most infamous nickname. He would leave a message after each crime (often in the blood of his murdered victims) proudly stating, \"Done by Mason of the Woods\". In April 1802, Mississippi Territorial Governor William C. C. Claiborne was informed that Mason and Wiley Harpe had attempted to board the boat of a Colonel Joshua Baker between Yazoo, now Yazoo, Mississippi, and Walnut Hills, now Vicksburg, Mississippi.\n\nAccording to a man named Swaney, who saw Samuel Mason often, described his appearance: \"He weighed about two hundred pounds, and was a fine looking man. He was rather modest and unassuming, and had nothing of the raw-head-and-bloody-bones appearance which his character would indicate\". Another man, Henry Howe described Mason as: \"...a man of gigantic stature and of more than ordinary talents\". A William Darby also described him as follows: \"Mason at any time of his life or in any situation, had something extremely ferocious in his look, which arose particularly from a tooth which projected forwards, and could only be covered with his lip by effort\".\n\nAccording to Spanish colonial court records, Spanish government officials arrested Samuel Mason and his men, early in 1803, at the Little Prairie settlement, now Caruthersville, in southeastern Missouri. Mason and his gang, including his family members, were taken to the Spanish colonial government in New Madrid, Spanish Upper Louisiana Territory, along the Mississippi River, where a three-day hearing was held to determine whether Mason was truly involved in river piracy, as he had been formally accused of this crime. Although he claimed he was simply a farmer, who had been maligned by his enemies, the peculiar presence of $7,000 in currency and twenty human scalps found in his baggage was the damning evidence that convinced the Spanish he indeed was a river pirate. Mason and his family were taken, under armed guard, to New Orleans, the capital of Spanish Lower Louisiana Territory, where the Spanish colonial governor ordered them handed over to the American authorities in the Mississippi Territory, as all crimes they had been convicted of appeared to have taken place in American territory or against American river boats.\n\nWhile being transported up the Mississippi River, Samuel Mason and gang members John Sutton or Setton, one of the many aliases used by Wiley Harpe, and James May, alias of Peter Alston, overpowered their guards and escaped, with Mason being shot in the head during the escape. One of the 1803 accounts {Rothert. p. 247} claimed Captain Robert McCoy, the commandant of New Madrid, was killed by Mason during their escape. McCoy actually died in 1840, and was neither crippled or killed, by Mason. American territorial governor William C. C. Claiborne, immediately issued a reward for their recapture, prompting Wiley Harpe and Peter Alston to bring Mason's head, in an attempt to claim the reward money. Whether they killed Mason or whether he died from his wound suffered in the escape attempt has never been established. Setton and May were recognized and identified as wanted criminals, Wiley Harpe and Peter Alston, were arrested, tried in U.S. federal court, found guilty of piracy, and hanged in Old Greenville, Jefferson County, Mississippi Territory in early 1804.\n\nFrom the 1790s-1833, James Ford led a double life while living in Ford's Ferry, Kentucky, as the justice of the peace and the gang leader of a group of highwaymen and river pirates on the Ohio River. From 1863-1864, Henry Plummer was the elected sheriff of the gold rush town, Bannack, Montana, in the Idaho Territory. He was later, accused of being the leader of an outlaw gang, the Innocents, who stole gold shipments from Bannick, and was hanged by Bannick vigilantes.\n\nIn the 1956 Walt Disney television series, \"Davy Crockett and the River Pirates\", a Hollywoodized version of Samuel Mason is portrayed by American actor, Mort Mills who appears alongside the Harpe brothers.\n\nIn the 1962 John Ford Western epic film, \"How the West Was Won\", a Samuel Mason-like frontier outlaw leader, of a gang of river pirates, is portrayed by Walter Brennan, as the fictional character of Colonel Jeb Hawkins, which alludes to the historical Cave-In-Rock.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8605413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8605413", "title": "San Jacinto Plaza", "text": "San Jacinto Plaza\n\nSan Jacinto Plaza is a historic park located on the corner of Oregon and Mills in the heart of Downtown El Paso, Texas.\n\nWhen the US government leased land from Smith's ranch, for the first Post opposite El Paso (meaning El Paso del Norte, later renamed Ciudad Juarez), U.S. Army troops would drill in the plaza. The city of El Paso acquired the property on which the Plaza is located in 1881 from William T. Smith. Smith had bought the land from the heirs of its early owner, Juan Maria Ponce de Leon, a prominent El Paso figure, who had owned the spot since 1827. The square had since been the location of the corrals for de León’s ranch. \nThe city cleared and cleaned the dry, sandy, mesquite-filled property and in 1903 the City Council officially named the park in honor of the famous battle Texas fought for its independence.\n\nJ. Fisher Satterwaite, El Paso Parks and Streets Commissioner, contracted with Fisher Satterthwaite to create beauty out of this desert patch. By 1883, the park was surrounded by a fence, a walled pond was created, a gazebo was erected and 75 Chinese Elm trees were planted. Satterthwaite then introduced three alligators into the pond. \n\nThe alligators were the central attraction and thrived. At one time the pond contained as many as seven of the reptiles. Most visitors to the park would rest on the wall surrounding the pond and watch the alligators. The reptiles quickly became a staple of the El Paso Culture. In 1952, an alligator named Oscar was hauled to Texas Western College and, as a prank, placed inside geology Professor Howard Quinn's office. On another occasion an alligator was found in the swimming pool at the college right before an intramural swim meet. Sally, one of the first alligators placed in the pond, was the object of a weight-guessing contest. The closest guess won $100 and a trip to Mexico. In 1952, Minnie, a 54-year-old female alligator, laid an egg in the pond and spectators were delighted when they saw a protective Minnie spring to life and rush towards her egg as park employees cleaned the pond.\n\nIn March 1953, Oscar was found dead at the bottom of the pond, the result of internal injuries after vandals removed him and threw him back into the pond when police arrived. Seven months later, El Pasoan Myrtle Price donated two alligators named Jack and Jill to the Plaza in place of Oscar.\n\nThe alligators were finally moved to the El Paso Zoo in 1965 after two were stoned to death and another had a spike driven through its left eye. The alligators were briefly returned to the plaza in 1972 only to be removed once again in 1974 at a cause of vandals. The pond was permanently removed shortly after.\n\nMany people still fondly refer to the plaza as “La Plaza de los Lagartos,” or Alligator Plaza. Today, a fiberglass sculpture by nationally acclaimed local artist Luis Jiménez honors the original alligators.\nAnother distinctive feature of the Plaza in the 1950s was a statue known as “The Boy with the Leaking Boot.” This statue stood in City Hall Park for 50 years before it was moved to San Jacinto Plaza. There it was surrounded by a moat and guarded by alligators. The statue currently stands on the first floor of El Paso's Museum of History.\n\nPreachers trying to spread the word of the gospel have always culminated at the plaza. In August 1952, a delegation of Baptist ministers held revivals in the park. The ceremonies attracting hundreds at a time. The ministers said they picked San Jacinto Plaza as a revival site because of the need to cut down on evil, drunkenness and communism.\n\nSince 1954, the traditional lighting of the city christmas tree in the Plaza has officially begun the Christmas season in El Paso. Mayor Fred Hervey was the first to officially light the thousands of multi-colored lights that covered the tree, fountains and nativity scenes. Thousands of El Pasoans watched this 20 minute ceremony which included music from the 62nd Army Band and featured Ted Bender as the Master of Ceremony.\n\nSan Jacinto Plaza has always served as a transportation terminal in El Paso. In 1907, horse-drawn carriages lined up around the Plaza. Before buses existed, trolleys made their daily stops at the Plaza. In the 1950s, the Plaza became a major boarding site for city buses as well as a pick-up point for private transportation such as taxicabs.\n\nSan Jacinto Plaza continues to be the heart of downtown El Paso, but like most public places, it has its share of problems. The plaza has experienced several remodelings since its origination. The plaza is still a transportation center, and volumes of people remain seated on benches almost daily. Friends still gather to eat and socialize.\n\nConcerns over beggars aggressively approaching park goers, as well as pickpockets have arisen. In recent years, the park has begun to attract transients, peddlers, the poor, and the homeless. Fountains are dry, furnishings are warped. Recently, the city has responded positively to the refurbishment of the park. In 2003, the entire park was once again cleared, cleaned, and rebuilt.\n\nAs of February 2016 the park is undergoing a $5.3 million renovation. The money for the renovation is from a quality of life bonds that was approved by the citizens of El Paso in November 2012. Funding is also from the Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone Fund which are special zones created by City Council to attract new investment in certain areas. For the past several months contractors have been working on excavation for irrigation and to add 10 feet of park on all sides, along with new sidewalks and gutters drains. All these improvements will be done in Phase 1 of the renovation. The second phase of the renovation started in February 2014. Which will include different amenities such as a full service café, a huacha court, reflecting pool, and splash pad. Crews will also be installing benches around the new modern park, along with landscaping and irrigation.\n\nSan Jacinto Plaza faced many delays throughout renovations which ranged from design changes to shipment delays. These delays pushed the completion date back more than a year. The original completion date was set for February 2015, but due to these delays the project was not complete until April 2016.\n\nDue to these delays mayor Oscar Leeser has stated that the city will bill the contracting company, Basic IDIQ, for these delays.\n\nThe official reopening date was April 16, 2016, at 9:30 a.m., where a ceremony was held at the Plaza in downtown El Paso. Followed by a celebration from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33476903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33476903", "title": "Sepro Mineral Systems", "text": "Sepro Mineral Systems\n\nSepro Mineral Systems Corp. is a multinational corporation founded in 1987 and headquartered in British Columbia, Canada. The outcome of the acquisition of Sepro Mineral Processing International by Falcon Concentrators in 2008, the companies' key focus is the production of mineral processing equipment for the mining and aggregate industries. Sepro Mineral Systems Corp. also provides engineering and process design services while continuing to advance its machine technology through research and development. Proprietary technology produced by Sepro includes grinding mills, ore scrubbers, vibrating screens, centrifugal gravity concentrators, agglomeration drums, and dense media separators. The company is also a supplier of single source modular pre-designed and custom designed plants and circuits which are made of Sepro's proprietary equipment as well as third party products.\n\nToday, Sepro Mineral Systems Corp. is represented by global agents in over 15 countries and has equipment operating in over 31 countries around the world.\n\nThe Falcon Concentrator is a type of gravity separation device for the recovery of valuable metals and minerals. There are three types of Falcon Concentrators: Falcon Semi-Batch (SB), Falcon Continuous (C) and Falcon Ultra-Fine (UF). All models of Falcon Concentrator rely on the creation of centrifugal forces by way of a rapidly rotating, vertical bowl in order to stratify and separate particles based on weight. The amount of gravitational force generated and the method of collecting these heavier particles differs for each model.\n\nThe Falcon semi batch centrifugal concentrator is primarily used for the recovery of free (liberated) precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum. The machine generates forces up to 200 times the force of gravity (200 G's) and makes use of a two-stage rotating bowl for mineral separation. The smooth-walled lower portion is for particle stratification and then a fluidized upper portion is used for the collection of the heavier particles. The machine is stopped periodically to rinse and collect the valuable concentrate from the bowl. The Falcon SB concentrator is used for gold recovery at many mines around the world, including Quadra Mining's Robinson mine in the United States, Newcrest Mining's Telfer Gold Mine in Australia and the Sadiola Gold Mine (owned principally by AngloGold Ashanti and IAMGOLD) in Mali.\n\nThe Falcon Continuous (C) centrifugal concentrator is primarily used for the separation of heavy minerals which occur in ore concentrations above 0.1% by weight, such as cassiterite, tantalum and scheelite. It is also used for coal cleaning and pre-concentration of gold bearing ores. The machine generates forces up to 300 times the force of gravity (300 G's) and operates by using a smooth-walled, rotating bowl to stratify the material into heavier and lighter fractions then uses pneumatic valves to control the amount of heavy material that reports to the concentrate collection stream. It does not use any fluidization water and relies entirely on centrifugal force for separation. The Falcon C concentrator is used in various process plants around the world, such as the Tanco mine in Canada, the Sekisovskoye mine in Kazakhstan and the Renison tin mine in Tasmania.\n\nThe Falcon Ultra-Fine (UF) centrifugal concentrator is primarily used for the separation of heavy minerals which occur in ore concentrations above 0.1% by weight, such as cassiterite, tantalum and scheelite when the majority of the particles are smaller than 75 µm. The machine generates forces up to 600 times the force of gravity (600 G's) and uses a smooth-walled bowl for particle stratification with a pneumatically controlled rubber lip for heavy material collection. The machine is stopped periodically to rinse and collect the valuable concentrate from the bowl. Studies have found that the deposition of heavy material within the bowl can be predicted by a hindered settling model. The Falcon UF concentrator is used in a number of process plants around the world such as the Tanco mine in Canada and the Bluestone tin mine in Tasmania.\n\nScrubbers are material washers used to break down and disperse clays in order to prepare mineral ores or construction aggregates for further processing. Sepro Tyre Drive Scrubbers are manufactured up to 3.6m in diameter and are capable of processing up to 1500 tonnes per hour of material. Shell supported Scrubbers such as the Sepro PTD Scrubber minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the washing drum. These scrubbers operate in many applications on feeds with high clay content, and are commonly used for difficult ore and stone washing duties. A few specified applications of Sepro Scrubbers include removal of gold “robbing” carboniferous material and other contaminants from gold ores, the processing of bauxite ores for aluminum production, the washing of laterites (gold, nickel, cobalt) to liberate fine metals for gravity recovery, and the washing of crushed aggregate, gravel and sand to remove clay contamination.\n\nSepro Agglomeration Drums are specifically designed to prepare feeds with high fines content on Gold and Base Metal heap loading operations. Processes where a Sepro Agglomeration Drum can be utilized include gold, copper, uranium and nickel laterite. The action in the agglomeration drum, combined with small additions of cement or lime, binds the fines into a \"pelletised\" product, which can be heaped and leached out without \"pooling\" and \"channelling\" caused by loss of heap permeability due to blinding by fines. The machine uses flexible rubber liners to prevent build up without the use of lifter bars and is adjustable on a pivotable base frame. Shell supported agglomerators such as the Sepro PTD Agglomeration Drum minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the unit.\n\nSepro Tyre Driven Grinding Mills are designed for small and medium capacity grinding applications, specifically small tonnage plants, regrinding mills, reagent prep and lime slaking. Sepro Pneumatic Tyre Driven (PTD) mills provide an alternative to standard trunnion drive systems. The drive consists of multiple gears boxes and electric motors directly connected and controlled through an AC variable frequency drive. Shell supported mills such as the Sepro PTD mills minimize stress on the mill shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the mill. Sepro Mills are suitable for Ball, Rod and Pebble charges and are available with overflow or grate discharge to suit the application. Shell supported Mills such as the Sepro PTD Grinding Mills minimize stress on the shell by spreading the power drive over the full length of the unit.\n\nThe Condor Dense Medium Separator (DMS) is a multi-stage, high efficiency media separation machine for mineral processing operations at the rougher and scavenger stage. It is typically used in a pre-concentration duty prior to processing or milling to reject barren material. The unit is manufactured with either two or three stages of separation depending on the media with one or two valuable densities resulting, while the unit can produce up to four products from one dense medium vessel altogether. The Condor DMS can take a larger feed particle size compared to a DMS cyclone of the same diameter and capacity, and is capable of handling higher sinks or floats loading without affecting performance. The valuable dense material (or 'sinks') can be combined or separated at the final stage and is then pumped onto the next process in the circuit.\nSepro Mineral Systems Corp. supplies customizable DMS Plants for a wide variety of application requirements. Sepro’s standard two product (concentrate, tailings) DMS Plant utilizes a two-stage Condor Separator and single density medium circuit, while the three product (concentrate, middlings, tailings) DMS Plant utilizes a three-stage Condor Separator and two medium circuits at high and low density.\n\nThe Sepro Leach Reactor is a high concentration leach reactor developed to treat the gold concentrate produced by the Falcon Concentrator. The unit consists of a concentrate holding tank and a leach tank and impeller which are linked by a Sepro vertical bowl pump. The SLR uses either peroxide or oxygen gas to achieve elevated levels of dissolved oxygen required to accelerate the leaching process with no reagents required. The pregnant leach solution produced can be directly electrowon. With the addition of an electrowinning unit the final product becomes a gold plated carbon that can be directly refined to produce gold bullion. \nExtensive test work of the SLR on site has shown over 99% of the target mineral is recovered through a simple, fully automated process that is easily incorporated into recovery operations.

Biddle Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202. The Ivy Hotel is situated in the Mount Vernon Baltimore City Historic District of Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe Ivy Hotel was developed through the adaptive reuse of an historic building. The property encompasses an historic home built in 1889, along with two adjoining Federal style townhouses. The property was acquired by the City of Baltimore in 1939 and was subsequently known as \"Government House\". The City used the property as the offices of the Baltimore City Department of Public Recreation from 1939 to 1983. Under the direction of then-Mayor of Baltimore, William Donald Schaefer, the property was subsequently redeveloped as \"The Inn at Government House\". The Inn served as the Official Guesthouse of the City of Baltimore from 1985 to 2010. In 2011, the City of Baltimore sold the property to a local private development consortium, Mount Vernon Mansion LLC, whose company planned to redevelop the site as a boutique hotel.\n\nThe Ivy Hotel opened on June 1, 2015, following an extensive historical restoration and renovation of the property.\n\nIn 1889, John Gilman, prosperous banker and industrialist, commissioned a mansion in Mount Vernon, Baltimore’s most prestigious neighborhood. He chose architect Charles Carson for the job, a master of design who had recently completed Baltimore’s Grand Masonic Venue and the opulent Methodist Church. Gilman asked Carson to build him a house to speak of wealth, power and taste, from its inlaid floors to its turreted slate roof. But Gilman also wanted a home. Its rooms should be intimate, its fireplaces welcoming, and its tall windows should frame the charming streetscape.\n\nThe mansion was raised on the leafy corner of Biddle and North Calvert Streets, neighbored on all sides by handsome brick and stone residences. But as fate would have it, Gilman did not live to enjoy his new home, dying suddenly just before the house was complete.\n\nMrs. Gilman lived at the Biddle Street mansion for several years, then sold it to a man named William Painter, and his amiable wife, Harriet. William was a wildly successful inventor, a holder of more than 100 patents, and the president of the Crown Cork and Seal Co., manufacturer of bottle caps, corks and closures of all kinds. The Painters were very sociable and philanthropic, hosting luncheons and bridge parties, dedicating parks and statues. The Painters and their three children divided their time between the house on Biddle Street and an opulent summer home in Guilford. Father and son were great fans of the work of Edgar Allan Poe, and made sure to send birthday flowers to his grave every year.\n\nWhen William passed on, Harriet built a children’s hospital in his name in the city. Soon afterwards, she sold the mansion to the Futcher family. Dr. Futcher was a Canadian physician, a noted diagnostician recruited to join Johns Hopkins, and he set up office and family in the Biddle Street house. The Futchers' lived and worked in the house into the 1930s.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the mansion was acquired by the Garrett family. Robert Garrett was an Olympic Athlete and Chairperson of an organization known as the Playground Athletic League (P.A.L.), serving the children of Baltimore. In 1939, Mr. Garrett and the P.A.L. donated the Mansion to the City of Baltimore, to be used as the Baltimore City Department of Public Recreation. Following its acquisition by the City of Baltimore, the property was known as \"Government House\". In 1969, the City purchased the two adjoining Federal style townhouses and expanded the office space. The Baltimore City Department of Public Recreation relocated to new facilities in 1983.\n\nFollowing the relocation of the Department of Public Recreation in 1983, then-Mayor of Baltimore, William Donald Schaefer, began a project to restore \"Government House\", as part of his initiative to preserve the rich architectural history of the City. Mayor Schaeffer's was a far-sighted and visionary concept, as many of the City's Victorian Mansions had by then been subdivided into apartments or offices, with the subsequent compromise of their architectural integrity. The restoration was carried out from 1983 to 1985, returning the Mansion to its original 19th-century appearance. The \"Inn at Government House\" was opened to the public in 1985. The Inn was renovated again in 1998. The Inn served as the Official Guesthouse of the City of Baltimore until 2010, at which time the City decided that the property was no longer needed and should be sold as surplus.\n\nIn 2010, the property was declared surplus by the City of Baltimore’s Space Utilization Committee. The Baltimore Development Corp. (BDC) solicited proposals for redeveloping the site. Mount Vernon Mansion LLC, a local private development consortium, was the only group which submitted a proposal. On October 11, 2011, the Baltimore Development Corp. (BDC) reported that it had sold the property encompassing the former Inn at Government House for $725,000, to Mount Vernon Mansion LLC, whose company planned to redevelop the site as a boutique hotel. The principals of the project are: Brown Capital Management, Baltimore, MD; Azola Companies, Baltimore, MD; Ziger/Snead Architects, Baltimore, MD; and Garrett Hotel Consultants (GHC), Charlotte, Vermont.\n\nThe developers and architect paid close attention to all aspects of the property's historic restoration and preservation. They employed a number of local craftspersons. The Ivy Hotel retains many of the property's original historic features, including, the green marble mined from local quarries, the parquet floors, pocket doors, the three-story Grand Staircase capped off with original skylights, carved wood wainscoting, 23 individual fireplaces, and the numerous leaded glass (stained glass) windows.\n\nDuring the restoration and renovation, the developers hosted a special behind the scenes tour, in conjunction with Baltimore Heritage, on December 3, 2014.\n\nThe Ivy Hotel was dedicated and opened for business on June 1, 2015. The Magdalena Restaurant within The Ivy Hotel opened to the public on June 19, 2015.\n"}

These efforts have been defined as a multi-level process through which reliance on the expatriate workforce is reduced and native-born population is prepared to take up jobs performed by expatriates. Such preparation enables native-born employees to perform their jobs equally as well as, if not better than, expatriates in the shortest possible period.\n\nEstablishing a skilled native-born workforce is one of the most critical challenges facing countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) from an economic security and a social inclusion perspective. Integration of skilled native-born workforce and reduction of dependence on the expatriate workers has been on the top of agendas of the GCC states. Furthermore, continued economic growth and industrial diversification demand qualified and competent local workforce. With growing population of young nationals graduating every year, there is an urgent need to integrate them into the job market especially in the private sector to strike the right balance in representing local talent in the workforce. To meet those challenges, governments adopted human resources development strategies (also known as Bahrainization, Emiratisation, Kuwaitization, Omanization, Qatarization, and Saudization) that target the employment of native-born workforce through various incentives, regulations, policies, educational reforms and economic diversification plans.\n\nSome forward-thinking organizations realized the benefit of workforce nationalization early on. Since 1960, Schlumberger has operated by a “recruit where we work” philosophy that is driven by the revenue size of a particular region. GCC states mandated their respective ministries of labor to establish employment quotas for different sectors to employ native-born workers. Failing to achieve these quotas can result in penalties and not being able to win government projects for example. There are different local bodies that are in place and are being set up to provide career advice, coaching, training and development mostly for recent graduates in order to accelerate their careers in the private sector. Each country has set its own nationalization quota focusing predominantly on banks, insurance firms, and commercial companies. Enforcing workforce nationalization in the GCC led to most of the business contracts or agreements with major companies outlining legal requirements for “Workforce Nationalization”, “Local Content”, “Localization” or “Technology and Knowledge Transfer”.\n\nMost of the efforts to enforce workforce nationalization have had mixed success thus far in their sustained implementation for a variety of reasons. According to Ms Randa Bahsoun, Partner – People & Organization Practice, PwC Middle East four main challenges in the workforce nationalization, “Balancing workforce nationalization efforts while leveraging experienced expatriate talent; public pressure to reduce local unemployment especially in the backdrop of low oil prices; skill shortages and increased global competition; and integration of women and millennials into the workforce at middle senior management levels.”\n\nA report from Kasim Randeree, a senior research at the University of Oxford, notes that the GCC states have all “become reliant on migrant workers” in recent decades, with Qatar and the UAE “at the extremity of the situation”. In ‘Workforce Nationalization in the Gulf Cooperation Council States’, he also notes that while much has been written and said on the reasons why these states are looking to nationalize their workforce, “only a limited body of knowledge exists to guide and shape the success of such schemes”. The need for a reliable workforce nationalization framework based on the proven business practices is critical now more than ever.\n\n\n"}
