The process is composed of two main activities: the making of the acquisition goal definition and the making of the acquisition planning. During the acquisition initiation, an iterative process arises in which questions about the goal of the acquisition are usually asked. In response to these questions the Library provides details of the requirements, covering areas such as cost, feasibility and timelines. An example of such requirements is the \"planning of the acquisition\", a component that may also lead to more questions about the acquisition goal (thus, it is reasonable to state that a relationship exists between the acquisition goal and the acquisition planning).\n\nThe process-data model shown in the following section displays the acquisition initiation stages. It shows both the process and the data ensuing from the process, and parts of the image will also be used as references in the body of this article. The concepts and data found in the model are explained in separate tables which can be found in the section immediately following the model. A textual, and more thorough, explanation of the activities and concepts that make up the Acquisition Initiation process can be found in the remainder of this article.\n\nThe draft acquisition goal is the description of the global goal that is to be achieved by starting procurement. It is inspired by the business needs or business strategy. It is similar, though simpler, to the concept of the project brief in PRINCE2. It is the first draft of the acquisition goal, containing at least a (short) problem definition and a (short) goal definition. The draft acquisition goal is meant to give the main reasons and the main goals to those people who will have to make the decision to actually start of the acquisition or not. It may thus also encapsulate items like a cost-benefit analysis, stakes & stakeholders and other items that will be further refined during the actual Acquisition Initiation.\nIt is, in this sense, \"not\" an activity of the acquisition initiation process, but it is the input for starting the process.\n\nThe problem definition is a statement about the problem that could be resolved by starting the acquisition process.\nThe goal definition is a statement about the goal that will have to be reached when the acquisition is executed:\n\nThe draft acquisition goal can be made as short or as long as is needed by the organization, as long as it serves to be a good basis to make the initial decision to start of an acquisition process.\n\nWhen the decision is made to start an acquisition process, the first activity of the acquisition initiation is to define the acquisition goal.\n\nThe acquisition goal is the whole of defined systems and services requirements, attributed by costs & benefits and stakes & stakeholders, with a defined target domain serving as the boundary. The acquisition goal is the basis of the acquisition process and for formulating the acquisition strategy during the acquisition planning. Input can be the draft acquisition goal and the business needs (of the target domain). The business needs can be derived from strategic business plans or information system plans.\n\nThe target domain is that part of the customer organization that is involved in, or influenced by an information service. It is defined in terms of business processes, business actors, business information, business technology and the relations between these four aspects. The target domain is identified to ensure a fitting acquisition goal with fitting requirements for the systems and services to be acquired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A limited description of a target domain can thus be, for example:\"<br>The part of customer organization that uses the software program MarketingUnlimited (fictional), involving the marketing-process, several types of information related to the marketing-department of the customer organization, the employees working in the marketing department and the production platform for MarketingUnlimited consisting of an application server, several workstations, and tools related to MarketingUnlimited.\n\nThe acquisition goal is then described by system descriptions and service descriptions:\n\n\n\nOther information on how ISPL defines the deliverables of the acquisition can be found in the general ISPL entry.\n\nCost–benefit analysis concerns the analysis of:\nto successfully evaluate the investment issues of the acquisition.\n\nIt is important to identify all actors affected, and in what way they are affected (their stake), because a negative attitude of actors may negatively influence the success of the acquisition. ISPL proposes to perform a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) for the actors involved to properly and thoroughly identify the stakes of the actors. The results of this analysis can serve as input for the situation & risk analysis.\n\nThe information contained within the Acquisition Goal is used to produce the acquisition plan. The acquisition plan is the master plan of the entire acquisition. In this plan delivery scenarios are determined and the situation and risks evaluated. And upon the basis of the scenario’s, situation and risks, a strategy is formed to manage the acquisition, its situation and risks. Furthermore, the acquisition plan will hold the main decision points, in which decisions are made about the deliverables within the acquisition and the acquisition organization (similar to a project organization) is formed.\n\nOn the basis of the acquisition goal, which contains among others the systems and services requirements and descriptions, scenarios can be formed for the deliveries of the information services to be acquired. Multiple scenarios may be built, which will then be evaluated and used in the design of the acquisition strategy. The scenarios are built with the priorities and interdependence of the deliverables in mind.\n\nPriorities are related to the importance of each delivery: which delivery has time-preference over another.\n\nSome deliveries may be dependent on each other, requiring one services to be delivered before the next one can be.\n\n\"Example:\"\nDuring a project to make ISPL more specific for generic product software implementations, a number of scenario’s were made. One of these was for an approach of a one-shot implementation. The below picture shows a diagram of the scenario that was made. An example of a scenario for the implementation of software is shown in the thumbnail on the right.\n\nIn this example, the general deliverables within an implementation of software are mentioned, executed and delivered differently as time goes by, mainly because of dependencies between deliverables. For instance, the actual go for the delivery of the software and the other related deliverables are dependent on the outcome of the deliverable “Proeftuin”. “Proeftuin” is an agreed period in which the software is extensively tested by the customer organization, provided and supported by the supplier. The customer organization can get a feel for the use of the software in the target domain, to guarantee that the software is a “fit” within the organization.\n\nISPL adheres to a situational approach to manage an acquisition. The situational approach takes into account properties of the problem situation, which are called situational factors. ISPL provides a number of these situational factors. Some of these situational factors affect events that have adverse consequences: the risks. Thus, the situational factors and risks within ISPL are related to each other. This makes it possible to provide a number of heuristics on which factors have an influence on certain risks.\nFirst the situation is analysed, then ISPL proposes a number of risks which may arise from the situation at hand. With this information, an acquisition strategy can be formed to mitigate both the situation and risks in a number of areas.\nOther information of the situation & risk analysis of ISPL can be found in the ISPL entry.\n\nThe acquisition strategy within ISPL acts as the design of a risk management strategy. The risk management strategy provides choices for options that reduce the probability and/or effect of risks. ISPL provides several options, divided over four classes:\nOptions are chosen based on their efficiency, costs and the related delay for delivery.\n\nBased upon all the previous activities, the decision points planning is made. This is a time-set planning of decision points.\n\nA decision point is described by:\n\nAn example of a decision points planning can be found through the thumbnail on the right. In this planning the decisions points are planned through time (top to bottom, left to right). This planning was taken from a study to make ISPL more specific for product software implementations. The decision points planning is thus aimed at a part of the process of a software implementation.\n\nA shortened example of a decision point description can be found in the image below. This description was taken from the same study to make ISPL more specific for product software implementations.\nThe acquisition organization is set, which is similar to a project organization. Although the acquisition organization is more focused on the (legal) relationship that it has to maintain with the supplier organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "733141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=733141", "title": "Agricultural economics", "text": "Agricultural economics\n\nAgricultural economics is an applied field of economics concerned with the application of economic theory in optimizing the production and distribution of food and fiber. Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics that specifically dealt with land usage, it focused on maximizing the crop yield while maintaining a good soil ecosystem. Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader. Agricultural economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional economics. Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics, econometrics, development economics, and environmental economics. Agricultural economics influences food policy, agricultural policy, and environmental policy.\n\nEconomics has been defined as the study of resource allocation under scarcity. Agricultural economics, or the application of economic methods to optimizing the decisions made by agricultural producers, grew to prominence around the turn of the 20th century. The field of agricultural economics can be traced out to works on land economics. Henry Charles Taylor was the greatest contributor with the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Wisconsin in 1909.\n\nAnother contributor, 1979 Nobel Economics Prize winner Theodore Schultz, was among the first to examine development economics as a problem related directly to agriculture. Schultz was also instrumental in establishing econometrics as a tool for use in analyzing agricultural economics empirically; he noted in his landmark 1956 article that agricultural supply analysis is rooted in \"shifting sand\", implying that it was and is simply not being done correctly.\n\nOne scholar summarizes the development of agricultural economics as follows:\n\n\"Agricultural economics arose in the late 19th century, combined the theory of the firm with marketing and organization theory, and developed throughout the 20th century largely as an empirical branch of general economics. The discipline was closely linked to empirical applications of mathematical statistics and made early and significant contributions to econometric methods. In the 1960s and afterwards, as agricultural sectors in the OECD countries contracted, agricultural economists were drawn to the development problems of poor countries, to the trade and macroeconomic policy implications of agriculture in rich countries, and to a variety of production, consumption, and environmental and resource problems.\"\n\nAgricultural economists have made many well-known contributions to the economics field with such models as the cobweb model, hedonic regression pricing models, new technology and diffusion models (Zvi Griliches), multifactor productivity and efficiency theory and measurement, and the random coefficients regression. The farm sector is frequently cited as a prime example of the perfect competition economic paradigm.\n\nIn Asia, agricultural economics was offered first by the University of the Philippines Los Baños Department of Agricultural Economics in 1919. Today, the field of agricultural economics has transformed into a more integrative discipline which covers farm management and production economics, rural finance and institutions, agricultural marketing and prices, agricultural policy and development, food and nutrition economics, and environmental and natural resource economics.\n\nSince the 1970s, agricultural economics has primarily focused on seven main topics, according to a scholar in the field: agricultural environment and resources; risk and uncertainty; food and consumer economics; prices and incomes; market structures; trade and development; and technical change and human capital.\n\nIn the field of environmental economics, agricultural economists have contributed in three main areas: designing incentives to control environmental externalities (such as water pollution due to agricultural production), estimating the value of non-market benefits from natural resources and environmental amenities (such as an appealing rural landscape), and the complex interrelationship between economic activities and environmental consequences. With regard to natural resources, agricultural economists have developed quantitative tools for improving land management, preventing erosion, managing pests, protecting biodiversity, and preventing livestock diseases.\n\nWhile at one time, the field of agricultural economics was focused primarily on farm-level issues, in recent years agricultural economists have studied diverse topics related to the economics of food consumption. In addition to economists' long-standing emphasis on the effects of prices and incomes, researchers in this field have studied how information and quality attributes influence consumer behavior. Agricultural economists have contributed to understanding how households make choices between purchasing food or preparing it at home, how food prices are determined, definitions of poverty thresholds, how consumers respond to price and income changes in a consistent way, and survey and experimental tools for understanding consumer preferences.\n\nAgricultural economics research has addressed diminishing returns in agricultural production, as well as farmers' costs and supply responses. Much research has applied economic theory to farm-level decisions. Studies of risk and decision-making under uncertainty have real-world applications to crop insurance policies and to understanding how farmers in developing countries make choices about technology adoption. These topics are important for understanding prospects for producing sufficient food for a growing world population, subject to new resource and environmental challenges such as water scarcity and global climate change.\n\nDevelopment economics is broadly concerned with the improvement of living conditions in low-income countries, and the improvement of economic performance in low-income settings. Because agriculture is a large part of most developing economies, both in terms of employment and share of GDP, agricultural economists have been at the forefront of empirical research on development economics, contributing to our understanding of agriculture's role in economic development, economic growth and structural transformation. Many agricultural economists are interested in the food systems of developing economies, the linkages between agriculture and nutrition, and the ways in which agriculture interact with other domains, such as the natural environment.\n\nThe International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE) is a worldwide professional association, which holds its major conference every three years. The association publishes the journal \"Agricultural Economics\". There also is a European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE), an African Association of Agricultural Economists [AAAE]and an Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society. Substantial work in agricultural economics internationally is conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute.\n\nIn the United States, the primary professional association is the Agricultural & Applied Economics Association (AAEA), which holds its own annual conference and also co-sponsors the annual meetings of the Allied Social Sciences Association (ASSA). The AAEA publishes the \"American Journal of Agricultural Economics\" and \"Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy\".\n\nGraduates from agricultural and applied economics departments find jobs in many sectors of the economy: agricultural management, agribusiness, commodities markets, education, the financial sector, government, natural resource and environmental management, real estate, and public relations. Careers in agricultural economics require at least a bachelor's degree, and research careers in the field require graduate-level training. A 2011 study by the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce rated agricultural economics tied for 8th out of 171 fields in terms of employability.\n\n\n"}

He trained men in hand-to-hand combat in both World War I and World War II, was a fellow of the American Geographical Society and founded a movement called \"Athletic Christianity\" that eventually attracted 300,000 members around the world. A 1955 \"Sports Illustrated\" article called him \"boxing's greatest amateur\" as well as a \"major factor in the re-establishment of boxing as a legal and, at that time, estimable sport.\"\n\nHe was born on October 1, 1874 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Edward Biddle II and Emily Drexel. He was grandson of banker Anthony Joseph Drexel, and great-grandson of banker Nicholas Biddle. Biddle was a graduate of Germany's Heidelberg University.\n\nAn officer in the United States Marine Corps, Biddle was an expert in close-quarters fighting and the author of \"Do or Die: A Supplementary Manual on Individual Combat\", a book on combat methods, including knives and empty-hand skills, training both the United States Marine Corps in two world wars and Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He can be seen training Marines in the RKO short documentary \"Soldiers of the Sea\". He was considered not just an expert in fighting, but also a pioneer of United States Marine Corps training in the bayonet and hand-to-hand combat. He based his style on fencing, though this approach was sometimes criticized as being unrealistic for military combat.\n\nHaving joined the Marines in 1917 at the age of 41, he also convinced his superiors to include boxing in Marine Corps recruit training. In 1919, he was promoted to the rank of major, and became a lieutenant colonel in 1934. In Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, right outside of Philadelphia, Biddle opened a military training facility, where he trained 4,000 men. His training included long hours of calisthenics and gymnastics, and taught skills such as machete, saber, dagger, and bayonet combat, as well as hand grenade use, boxing, wrestling, savate and jiujitsu. He also served two years in the National Guard.\n\nA keen boxer, Biddle sparred with Jack Johnson and taught boxing to Gene Tunney. He even hosted \"boxing teas\" in his home, where other boxers would spar a couple of rounds with him and then join the family for dinner. A February 1909 match with Philadelphia Jack O'Brien was attended by society leaders including women in elegant evening gowns.\n\nHe served as a judge in the fight between Jack Dempsey and Jess Willard on 4 July 1919.\nOn the 5th of February 1920, Biddle, as chairman of the Army Navy and Civilian Board of Boxing Control of New York, became a member the International Boxing Union.\n\nBiddle also worked in and on periodicals. He spent time as a sports reporter for the \"Public Ledger\", and jokingly referred to himself as \"the poorest and richest reporter in Philadelphia\". He also revived the \"Philadelphia Sunday Graphic\" for a short interval, before it was forced to fold, and founded a short-lived \"society weekly\"–type publication, \"The People\". After organizing the also short-lived Drexel Biddle Publishing House, he acted as its head for two years.\n\nBooks written by Biddle include:\n\n\nIn 1895, he married Cordelia Rundell Bradley.

In 1956, it was made into a play starring Walter Pidgeon.

{"id": "7990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7990", "title": "Data warehouse", "text": "Data warehouse\n\nIn computing, a data warehouse (DW or DWH), also known as an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system used for reporting and data analysis, and is considered a core component of business intelligence. DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They store current and historical data in one single place that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise.\n\nThe data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational systems (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an operational data store and may require data cleansing for additional operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the DW for reporting.\n\nThe typical extract, transform, load (ETL)-based data warehouse uses staging, data integration, and access layers to house its key functions. The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems. The integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an operational data store (ODS) database. The integrated data are then moved to yet another database, often called the data warehouse database, where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups, often called dimensions, and into facts and aggregate facts. The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema. The access layer helps users retrieve data.\n\nThe main source of the data is cleansed, transformed, catalogued, and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining, online analytical processing, market research and decision support. However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform, and load data, and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system. Many references to data warehousing use this broader context. Thus, an expanded definition for data warehousing includes business intelligence tools, tools to extract, transform, and load data into the repository, and tools to manage and retrieve metadata.\n\nA data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems. This architectural complexity provides the opportunity to:\n\nThe environment for data warehouses and marts includes the following:\n\n\nIn regards to source systems listed above, R. Kelly Rainer states, \"A common source for the data in data warehouses is the company's operational databases, which can be relational databases\".\n\nRegarding data integration, Rainer states, \"It is necessary to extract data from source systems, transform them, and load them into a data mart or warehouse\".\n\nRainer discusses storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts.\n\nMetadata are data about data. \"IT personnel need information about data sources; database, table, and column names; refresh schedules; and data usage measures\".\n\nToday, the most successful companies are those that can respond quickly and flexibly to market changes and opportunities. A key to this response is the effective and efficient use of data and information by analysts and managers. A \"data warehouse\" is a repository of historical data that are organized by subject to support decision makers in the organization. Once data are stored in a data mart or warehouse, they can be accessed.\n\nA data mart is a simple form of a data warehouse that is focused on a single subject (or functional area), hence they draw data from a limited number of sources such as sales, finance or marketing. Data marts are often built and controlled by a single department within an organization. The sources could be internal operational systems, a central data warehouse, or external data. Denormalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system. Given that data marts generally cover only a subset of the data contained in a data warehouse, they are often easier and faster to implement.\n\nTypes of data marts include dependent, independent, and hybrid data marts.\n\nOnline analytical processing (OLAP) is characterized by a relatively low volume of transactions. Queries are often very complex and involve aggregations. For OLAP systems, response time is an effectiveness measure. OLAP applications are widely used by Data Mining techniques. OLAP databases store aggregated, historical data in multi-dimensional schemas (usually star schemas). OLAP systems typically have data latency of a few hours, as opposed to data marts, where latency is expected to be closer to one day. The OLAP approach is used to analyze multidimensional data from multiple sources and perspectives. The three basic operations in OLAP are : Roll-up (Consolidation), Drill-down and Slicing & Dicing.\n\nOnline transaction processing (OLTP) is characterized by a large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). OLTP systems emphasize very fast query processing and maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments. For OLTP systems, effectiveness is measured by the number of transactions per second. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. The schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model (usually 3NF). Normalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system.\n\nPredictive analytics is about finding and quantifying hidden patterns in the data using complex mathematical models that can be used to predict future outcomes. Predictive analysis is different from OLAP in that OLAP focuses on historical data analysis and is reactive in nature, while predictive analysis focuses on the future. These systems are also used for customer relationship management (CRM).\n\nThe concept of data warehousing dates back to the late 1980s when IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy developed the \"business data warehouse\". In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to decision support environments. The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments. In larger corporations, it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as legacy systems), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from \"data marts\" that was tailored for ready access by users.\n\nKey developments in early years of data warehousing were:\n\n\nA fact is a value or measurement, which represents a fact about the managed entity or system.\n\nFacts, as reported by the reporting entity, are said to be at raw level. E.g. in a mobile telephone system, if a BTS (base transceiver station) received 1,000 requests for traffic channel allocation, it allocates for 820, and rejects the remaining, it would report three facts or measurements to a management system:\n\nFacts at the raw level are further aggregated to higher levels in various dimensions to extract more service or business-relevant information from it. These are called aggregates or summaries or aggregated facts.\n\nFor instance, if there are three BTS in a city, then the facts above can be aggregated from the BTS to the city level in the network dimension. For example:\n\n\nThere are three or more leading approaches to storing data in a data warehouse — the most important approaches are the dimensional approach and the normalized approach.\n\nThe dimensional approach refers to Ralph Kimball's approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using a Dimensional Model/star schema. The normalized approach, also called the 3NF model (Third Normal Form) refers to Bill Inmon's approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using an E-R model/normalized model.\n\nIn a dimensional approach, transaction data are partitioned into \"facts\", which are generally numeric transaction data, and \"dimensions\", which are the reference information that gives context to the facts. For example, a sales transaction can be broken up into facts such as the number of products ordered and the total price paid for the products, and into dimensions such as order date, customer name, product number, order ship-to and bill-to locations, and salesperson responsible for receiving the order.\n\nA key advantage of a dimensional approach is that the data warehouse is easier for the user to understand and to use. Also, the retrieval of data from the data warehouse tends to operate very quickly. Dimensional structures are easy to understand for business users, because the structure is divided into measurements/facts and context/dimensions. Facts are related to the organization's business processes and operational system whereas the dimensions surrounding them contain context about the measurement (Kimball, Ralph 2008). Another advantage offered by dimensional model is that it does not involve a relational database every time. Thus, this type of modeling technique is very useful for end-user queries in data warehouse.\n\nThe model of facts and dimensions can also be understood as data cube. Where the dimensions are the categorical coordinates in a multi-dimensional cube, while the fact is a value corresponding to the coordinates.\n\nThe main disadvantages of the dimensional approach are the following:\n\nIn the normalized approach, the data in the data warehouse are stored following, to a degree, database normalization rules. Tables are grouped together by \"subject areas\" that reflect general data categories (e.g., data on customers, products, finance, etc.). The normalized structure divides data into entities, which creates several tables in a relational database. When applied in large enterprises the result is dozens of tables that are linked together by a web of joins. Furthermore, each of the created entities is converted into separate physical tables when the database is implemented (Kimball, Ralph 2008).\nThe main advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to add information into the database. Some disadvantages of this approach are that, because of the number of tables involved, it can be difficult for users to join data from different sources into meaningful information and to access the information without a precise understanding of the sources of data and of the data structure of the data warehouse.\n\nBoth normalized and dimensional models can be represented in entity-relationship diagrams as both contain joined relational tables. The difference between the two models is the degree of normalization (also known as Normal Forms). These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there are other approaches. Dimensional approaches can involve normalizing data to a degree (Kimball, Ralph 2008).\n\nIn \"Information-Driven Business\", Robert Hillard proposes an approach to comparing the two approaches based on the information needs of the business problem. The technique shows that normalized models hold far more information than their dimensional equivalents (even when the same fields are used in both models) but this extra information comes at the cost of usability. The technique measures information quantity in terms of information entropy and usability in terms of the Small Worlds data transformation measure.\n\nIn the \"bottom-up\" approach, data marts are first created to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific business processes. These data marts can then be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse. The data warehouse bus architecture is primarily an implementation of \"the bus\", a collection of conformed dimensions and conformed facts, which are dimensions that are shared (in a specific way) between facts in two or more data marts.\n\nThe \"top-down\" approach is designed using a normalized enterprise data model. \"Atomic\" data, that is, data at the greatest level of detail, are stored in the data warehouse. Dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse.\n\nData warehouses (DW) often resemble the hub and spokes architecture. Legacy systems feeding the warehouse often include customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning, generating large amounts of data. To consolidate these various data models, and facilitate the extract transform load process, data warehouses often make use of an operational data store, the information from which is parsed into the actual DW. To reduce data redundancy, larger systems often store the data in a normalized way. Data marts for specific reports can then be built on top of the data warehouse.\n\nA hybrid DW database is kept on third normal form to eliminate data redundancy. A normal relational database, however, is not efficient for business intelligence reports where dimensional modelling is prevalent. Small data marts can shop for data from the consolidated warehouse and use the filtered, specific data for the fact tables and dimensions required. The DW provides a single source of information from which the data marts can read, providing a wide range of business information. The hybrid architecture allows a DW to be replaced with a master data management repository where operational, not static information could reside.\n\nThe data vault modeling components follow hub and spokes architecture. This modeling style is a hybrid design, consisting of the best practices from both third normal form and star schema. The data vault model is not a true third normal form, and breaks some of its rules, but it is a top-down architecture with a bottom up design. The data vault model is geared to be strictly a data warehouse. It is not geared to be end-user accessible, which when built, still requires the use of a data mart or star schema based release area for business purposes.\n\nThere are basic features that define the data in the data warehouse that include subject orientation, data integration, time-variant, nonvolatile data, and data granularity.\n\nUnlike the operational systems, the data in the data warehouse revolves around subjects of the enterprise (database normalization). Subject orientation can be really useful for decision making.\nGathering the required objects is called subject oriented.\n\nThe data found within the data warehouse is integrated. Since it comes from several operational systems, all inconsistencies must be removed. Consistencies include naming conventions, measurement of variables, encoding structures, physical attributes of data, and so forth.\n\nWhile operational systems reflect current values as they support day-to-day operations, data warehouse data represents data over a long time horizon (up to 10 years) which means it stores historical data. It is mainly meant for data mining and forecasting, If a user is searching for a buying pattern of a specific customer, the user needs to look at data on the current and past purchases.\n\nThe data in the data warehouse is read-only which means it cannot be updated, created, or deleted.\n\nIn the data warehouse, data is summarized at different levels.The user may start looking at the total sale units of a product in an entire region. Then the user looks at the states in that region. Finally, they may examine the individual stores in a certain state. Therefore, typically, the analysis starts at a higher level and moves down to lower levels of details.\n\nThe different methods used to construct/organize a data warehouse specified by an organization are numerous. The hardware utilized, software created and data resources specifically required for the correct functionality of a data warehouse are the main components of the data warehouse architecture. All data warehouses have multiple phases in which the requirements of the organization are modified and fine tuned.\n\nOperational systems are optimized for preservation of data integrity and speed of recording of business transactions through use of database normalization and an entity-relationship model. Operational system designers generally follow Codd's 12 rules of database normalization to ensure data integrity. Fully normalized database designs (that is, those satisfying all Codd rules) often result in information from a business transaction being stored in dozens to hundreds of tables. Relational databases are efficient at managing the relationships between these tables. The databases have very fast insert/update performance because only a small amount of data in those tables is affected each time a transaction is processed. To improve performance, older data are usually periodically purged from operational systems.\n\nData warehouses are optimized for analytic access patterns. Analytic access patterns generally involve selecting specific fields and rarely if ever 'select *' as is more common in operational databases. Because of these differences in access patterns, operational databases (loosely, OLTP) benefit from the use of a row-oriented DBMS whereas analytics databases (loosely, OLAP) benefit from the use of a column-oriented DBMS. Unlike operational systems which maintain a snapshot of the business, data warehouses generally maintain an infinite history which is implemented through ETL processes that periodically migrate data from the operational systems over to the data warehouse.\n\nThese terms refer to the level of sophistication of a data warehouse:\n\n\n"}

He was a descendant of Lion Gardiner (1599–1663) who was an early English settler and soldier that founded the first English settlement in what became the state of New York on Long Island, including Gardiners Island. He graduated from Yale University in 1804 along with future U.S. Senator from South Carolina, John Calhoun.\n\nHe practiced law for several years, but beginning in 1815 when he married Juliana McLachlan, one of the wealthiest women in New York, he managed her extensive real estate holdings in Manhattan. He was elected to one four-year term as a member of the New York State Senate representing the 1st District of Suffolk County from 1824 to 1828. Gardiner was a supporter of John Quincy Adams, member of the People's Party, which was opposed to the emerging Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson.\n\nHe later lived at 430 Lafayette Street in Manhanttan, \"when that sections was one of the social centres of the city\".\n\nIn the 1840s, he took his family to Washington, D.C., for several months of the year, in part to find an appropriate husband for his daughter Julia. His family became part of the social circle of President John Tyler and his family.\n\nGardiner died in an explosion aboard the USS \"Princeton\" on February 28, 1844. President Tyler had proposed to his daughter Julia in February 1843. She had refused him at first but sometime in 1843 they agreed to marry at some future time out of respect for the fact that the President had only been a widow since September 1842. David Gardiner and his daughters Julia and Margaret were aboard a pleasure cruise on the Potomac River. As the neared Mount Vernon, a cannon that was being demonstrated exploded, killing Gardiner and five others. Funeral services for the five white victims were held in the East Room of the White House. Gardiner was interred in the Public Vault at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. His remains were later moved to the Gardiner family plot at the South End Cemetery in East Hampton, New York.\n\nPresident Tyler proposed marriage several more times before being accepted. He and Julia Gardiner wed on June 26, 1844. They named their first child David Gardiner Tyler in honor of his maternal grandfather.\n\nIn 1815, he married Juliana McLachlan (1799–1864), the daughter of Michael McLachlan, who was born and raised in Jamaica, West Indies. His father had been a Scottish warrior in the Battle of Culloden in 1746, between the Jacobites and the military forces in the service of King of England, who was beheaded. They family moved from Jamaica to New York and established a successful brewery in lower Manhattan that led to their purchase of some thirteen pieces of commercial and residential Manhattan real estate, which Juliana inherited, making her one of the wealthiest women in New York.

{"id": "21141964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21141964", "title": "David Kraiselburd", "text": "David Kraiselburd\n\nDavid Kraiselburd (1912–1974) was an Argentine journalist, newspaper publisher, and lawyer, best known for his commitment and actions against military regimes and political violence of both right- and left-wing extraction. He was assassinated shortly after the beginning of the Dirty War—in mid-1974—and shortly before the military coup.\n\nDavid Kraiselburd was born into a working-class Ukrainian Jewish family in Berisso, an industrial city north of La Plata, Argentina, in 1912. In his teens, a high-school writing contest earned him an internship in La Plata's main daily, \"El Día\", after the end of which he was hired by the paper as a sports commentator. He enrolled in the prestigious University of La Plata, and, at the paper, he was promoted to university affairs correspondent. He was also involved in university politics—he had anarchist sympathies, and had protested Sacco and Vanzetti's execution a few years earlier. After earning the equivalent of a JD degree from Law School, he became a representative of the alumni association (\"Graduados\"). To broaden his background, he re-enrolled in the university and earned another degree in History. Also in those early years, the paper sent him to Spain to cover the Spanish Civil War.\n\nGradually, he rose up in the journalistic ranks and became a prominent figure within and outside the paper. \"El Día\"'s financial straits eventually led the heirs of its founding partners to sell part of their stake in the daily, and, in September 1961, Kraiselburd purchased a share of \"El Día\". The main owners of the daily became, thus, the Fascetto family (heirs of one of the founding partners) and Kraiselburd, although none had a controlling share (this partnership ended in 2010, with an agreement that gave the Fascetto family full control of \"Diario Popular\", founded by Kraiselburd in 1974, while control of \"El Día\" was given fully to the Kraiselburd family, especially his eldest son, Raul, who took up his father's post after his murder).\n\nPutting his legal background in action as director and editor-in-chief, Kraiselburd was among the few Argentine publishers to openly oppose the 1966 coup d'état against the moderate, democratically elected President Arturo Illia. Kraiselburd denounced the imminent coup, and then refused to publish dictator Juan Carlos Onganía's inaugural address. Onganía's La Plata officials retaliated by confiscating that day's circulation and harassing the paper.\n\n\"El Día\"'s challenges were not mitigated by the March 1973 return to democracy in 1973. A decree signed by interim President Raúl Lastiri sought to prohibit Argentine periodicals' access to international news agencies wires, in an attempt to limit them to wires published by Telam, the state news agency founded by Lastiri's benefactor, populist former President Juan Perón. This measure amounted to a monopoly of news wires by the state agency, controlled by the government. Kraiselburd moved quickly, however, and, on his initiative, \"El Día\" and numerous other Argentine dailies established a national news agency, \"Noticias Argentinas\". He was named president of the agency while remaining at the helm of \"El Día\".\n\nStaunchly centrist, \"El Día\" marshaled its \"Page 4\" editorial section, which had openly opposed the Ongania coup in the 60s, and that by early 1974 denounced the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance (AAA), a right-wing paramilitary organization that was given free rein (and was supported by) the Ministry of Welfare in chasing down left-wing organizations. Naturally, the stronger left-wing organizations (i.e., the left-Peronist Montoneros) retaliated. Yet, by the same token, \"El Dia\" warned against the escalation of violence that was ensuing, as well as against the increasingly violent \"politics\" of both Left and Right. \"Violence was the main medium of politics first, and politics later,\" as researcher Pilar Calveiro succinctly said in regard to the process underwent by the left-wing Montoneros. Threatened by both the AAA and Montoneros, and although he was a more \"fitting\" target for the former, it was the latter organization the one which took action against the paper and its editor. Kraiselburd was kidnapped on June 25, 1974 by a Montoneros cell while the editor was walking toward the newspaper building.\n\nIn a spree against dissenters, and prefiguring Kraiselburd's fate, on July 15 a Montoneros unit burst into a small-town restaurant and machine-gunned a frequent \"El Dia\" contributor, former Interior (law enforcement) Minister Arturo Mor Roig, who, under the military regime of Gen. Lanusse, had been instrumental in the transition toward democracy that led to two 1973 elections, which Peron's stand-in (Hector Campora) first, and Peron later, won by a landslide. Mor Roig was a well-known moderate democrat. He had knowingly sacrificed his political career when he accepted the position offered to him by Gen. Lanusse years earlier, for the sake of speeding up the transition toward democracy. Montoneros, however, emphasized that during Mor Roig's tenure, prominent political prisoners had been massacred in the course of (and even \"after\") a partially successful escape attempt in a Patagonian prison. The massacre had been brutal, but it was known that Mor Roig had had no involvement whatsoever. Yet, on Montoneros' view, his past association with a military government, in addition to his 1974 \"El Dia\" critical articles, made him a suitable target.\n\nAs many Montoneros acknowledged—most remarkably, intelligence officer, journalist, and outstanding writer Rodolfo Walsh—these \"acts of individual terror,\" as Walsh called them, would not only backfire, but make popular support dwindle.\n\nKraiselburd would soon follow Mor Roig's fate. He was being held captive in a house in Gonnet, located between La Plata and Buenos Aires. Twenty odd days after the kidnapping, a neighbor called the police after noticing \"suspicious activity\" in the house next door. On July 17, 1974, a police unit was sent to investigate, and a shooting between the Montoneros cell and the police ensued. Outnumbered, the Montoneros shot Kraiselburd to death and fled the scene.\n\nIn September 1975, Kraiselburd was posthumously awarded the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot prize by Columbia University's School of Journalism, for his defense of democratic values in the face of forms of authoritarianism of both right-wing and left-wing leanings.\n\nAfter Kraiselburd's murder, his eldest son, Raul, took up his post. Under his direction, and following the lead of his father, \"El Dia\" continued its explicit plea for the adherence to consensus-building, democratic practices, and its equally explicit rejection of lawless, criminal murders and disappearances, increasingly effected with the support of the State apparatus (1975) and, after the coup (1976) with the \"full\" disposal of the State resources at the tip of the Armed Forces. Threats from right-wing paramilitary groups, bombs in the printing press, random machine-gun attacks on buildings and houses, and other intimidatory tactics were overshadowed by the kidnapping and murder of Raul's two-year-old son, named David, after his grandfather. Chalked up to the action of \"run-of-the-mill\" kidnappers in search for a ransom, the case of David Kraiselburd's homonymous grandson was never fully explained—nor was the baby's body ever found.\n\nDespite sporadic anti-Semitic aspersions claiming the contrary, \"El Día\" was, as media researcher Cesar Diaz put it in a book-length critical analysis of the printed media under the 1976-83 dictatorship, one of the few \"non-partner\" (no socios) newspapers, along with the better-known case of \"The Buenos Aires Herald\"and a few others; that is, newspapers that didn't partake in the \"gentleman's agreement\" that the military regime had imposed. The \"non-partners,\" therefore, reported on disappearances and related crimes perpetrated by the regime. In this connection, both Robert Cox, from the \"Herald\", and Raul Kraiselburd, from \"El Dia\", were also awarded Columbia University's Moors Cabot Prize. Diaz's analysis of the media under the military regime, unusually virtuous in escaping the widespread polarization of accounts of the 1970s (and therefore advancing a critical stance, rather than an unqualified paean), hints that the example of the late David Kraiselburd strengthened the commitment of the journalists who risked their lives every day at the newsroom during the dark years of the juntas.\n\n"}

Aguiar was recognized as a philanthropist who supported a variety of Jewish causes including Nefesh B'Nefesh and the March of the Living. In July 2009, Aguiar invested over $4 million (USD) in support of the Beitar Jerusalem Football Club.\n\nOn June 20, 2012, Aguiar was reported missing after his unoccupied boat was found on Fort Lauderdale Beach. The day before Aguiar went missing, a federal court judge ordered his mental health records be presented to the court as part of a lawsuit between him and his uncle Thomas Kaplan.\n\nAguiar was declared legally dead in January 2015.\n\nAguiar was born on May 31, 1977 in Rio de Janeiro. He was one of four children of Ellen ( Kaplan), a Jewish mother, and Otto de Souza Aguiar, a Christian father. His mother is the sister of billionaire investor Thomas Kaplan, and his father was an artist and model. Though Ellen is halachically Jewish, she considers herself a born-again Christian; Guma was raised as a Christian and the rest of the Aguiar family practiced Christianity as well. At age 26, Aguiar returned to Jewish observance after meeting rabbi Tovia Singer. However, because he was born to an halachically Jewish mother, he did not need to formally convert.\n\nHis family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida when Aguiar was one year old. He graduated from the Westminster Academy Christian School in 1995. Aguiar enrolled at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina but dropped out after one year.\n\nAguiar was the vice chairman and chief executive officer of Leor Energy. Aguiar began his career as a clerk on the floor of the NYMEX in 1999 where he focused on the energy markets, with particular emphasis on natural gas. Transitioning from daily trading activity to the long-term physical markets, Aguiar joined with his uncle, Thomas Kaplan, in 2001 to manage a portfolio of family investments ranging from venture capital to private equity and debt. During this time, he served as a director of several public and private companies and was given responsibility for creating a U.S.-based energy company focused on aggressive early-stage oil and gas exploration. After assembling a diversified portfolio of energy properties in Louisiana and Texas, ranging from unconventional natural gas to shallow oil, Aguiar identified and executed Leor's acquisition of its flagship property in the Deep Bossier of East Texas in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, under Aguiar's executive management, Leor Energy engineered financings which fully capitalized the projects in Leor Energy LP. Included in these transactions were Leor Energy Lp industrial alliance with Encana, a natural gas producer in North America and the Leor Energy Lp joint-venture partner in the Deep Bossier. \nUnder Aguiar, a mezzanine financing with hedge-fund Amaranth Capital LLC was achieved. Leor Energy has a financial alliance with its first strategic equity partner, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nAguiar joined Cadence Resources in July 2002 and served as a Member of the Board of Directors of Corporate Development until June 30, 2003.\n\nAguiar was the director of the Lillian Jean Kaplan Foundation and was involved in numerous philanthropic activities. He donated more than US$8 million to fund the activities of Nefesh B'Nefesh, a Zionist organization which promotes Aliyah (Jewish immigration) from North America and the United Kingdom to Israel. He was a supporter of the March of the Living, which organizes educational programming in Poland and Israel to enable students to better understand the Holocaust and the rebirth of Zionism and the creation of the modern Jewish state of Israel.\n\nFor his philanthropic activities, in April 2009, The Jewish Week recognized Aguiar as one of the \"36 under 36″ (one of 36 of the most influential Jewish leaders under the age of 36).\n\nIn 2008, Aguiar founded the \"Defender of Jerusalem Award\" which recognizes public figures who have taken uniquely strong stances in support of Jerusalem.\n\nIn October 2009, Aguiar and his wife Jamie served as the co-chairs of the \"Facing Tomorrow\" Conference in Jerusalem organized by Israel's President Shimon Peres. During the conference, Aguiar was featured on a panel with the President and offered his vision of Israeli society and culture from the perspective of one of the country's most recognized entrepreneurs.\n\nOn July 21, 2009, Aguiar announced an investment of over US$4 million to support the Beitar Jerusalem Football Team which, despite a massive fan following, had grown into financial distress and was on the brink of collapse prior to Aguiar's financial contributions. Aguiar was motivated to purchase the team out of his love for the sport combined with a passion for Jerusalem and Israel.\n\nIn September 2009, Aguiar took his commitment to Jerusalem sports to the next level when he invested over $1.5 million in the city's leading basketball franchise, Hapoel Jerusalem.\n\nSince these investments, Aguiar became a fixture in Israeli social circles and regularly met with members of Knesset and local political and business leaders.\n\nAguiar managed the teams and was in contact with the general managers of both Betar (Itzik Kornfein) and Hapoel (Dani Klein). In November 2009, Aguiar travelled with Kornfein to Brazil with the goal of scouting out players for the Betar team. He made an effort to be at team practices and met with the players and staff of both teams.\n\nBeitar fans attribute Beitar's winning the Toto Cup on 26 January 2010 to Aguiar's financial backing, although it was won while Aguiar was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility. About a half an hour after winning, Itzik Kornfein took the Toto Cup to the psychiatric hospital but was not permitted to enter. He asked the security staff to take in the trophy to the hospitalized Aguiar.\n\nIn 2005, Aguiar married his Westminster Academy high school sweetheart, Jamie Elizabeth Black. Jamie graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in Public Relations. They had four children, Jacob, Lilly, Jonathan, and Leo and celebrated both Christmas and Hanukkah. The process of immigration to Israel was an act described by himself as a personal dream. Prior to his disappearance, Aguiar divided his time between the Yemin Moshe quarter in Jerusalem and South Florida.\n\nAguiar was friends with Alan Dershowitz.\n\nAguiar was a Zionist.\n\nAguiar pleaded no contest to drug charges in 2009 after police found marijuana in his car during a traffic stop in Florida. Aguiar publicly stated that the police were out to get him and that \"When I got to the prison [an officer] took my kippah off and then tried to convert me to Christianity.\" Aguiar hired Alan Dershowitz to represent him.\n\nAguiar's wife Jamie filed a domestic violence protective order against him in the summer of 2011. He then filed for divorce, but both the domestic violence allegations and the divorce filing were stopped.\n\nAguiar's mother has said that Aguiar experienced his first psychotic episode at age 19 and that he was diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder and psychosis.\n\nAguiar was admitted to psychiatric hospitals several times.\n\nOn January 14, 2010, Aguiar was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital in Israel by his mother.\n\nIn 2011, due to his mental illness, his wife Jamie and mother Ellen petitioned a Miami-Dade judge for guardianship over Aguiar. The court agreed, and appointed an emergency guardianship over Aguiar.\n\nTwo days after his disappearance in June 2012, Aguiar's mother filed documents in Broward County, Florida court to become conservator of his nearly $100 million fortune. In Ellen Aguiar's petition, she wrote that Guma \"disappeared as the result of mental derangement or other mental cause\" or disappeared \"under circumstances indicating that he may have died, either naturally, or accidentally.\" It further stated that he suffered from \"severe bipolar disorder.\"\n\nAguiar was sued by his uncle Thomas Kaplan. As part of that lawsuit, the judge presiding over the case, John O'Sullivan, found that Aguiar's psychosis \"manifested itself in both grandiose and paranoid delusions,\" for example, Aguiar's belief that he (Aguiar) was being followed by snipers. On the day Aguiar disappeared, a federal judge in Florida issued an order appointing an independent medical examiner to see if Aguiar was psychologically sound enough for a deposition in the case.\n\nOn June 20, 2012, Aguiar's 31-foot, center console Jupiter boat, named the \"T.T. Zion\", landed on Fort Lauderdale Beach east of East Las Olas Boulevard around 1:15 a.m., with its navigation lights on and engines still running, according to the \"Sun-Sentinel\". Sea Tow, the company that Fort Lauderdale authorities contracted to tow the boat, said that the vessel appeared seaworthy and did not believe a mechanical problem had occurred. Aguiar's wallet and cell phone were found on board, but no sign of him or any other passenger was found. Authorities on ATVs searched up and down the beach, but found no sign of Aguiar. The Coast Guard commenced a search at sea. A search of his house found that his watch and wedding band had been left behind. In July 2012 and June 2013, the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department said that even though the investigation remains open, there have been no significant leads in the case.\n\nAguiar was declared legally dead on January 29, 2015, two years and seven months after his disappearance.\n"}

He creates, develops and manages financial projects in Africa, specifically in Angola, in both Congos, South Africa and Mozambique. Hélder Bataglia is founder and president of the Escom Group.\n\nAt the age of one year Helder Bataglia arrives in Angola, at the time a Portuguese colony. His father was a director of a German fish flour production company in the Benguela province. Hélder is raised in the municipality of Baía Farta and attends a local school. At the age of ten he leaves Baía Farta to study in Benguela and later at the Institute of Industry of Huambo, Central Plateau of Angola. He studies engineering, interrupted by the military service from 1969 to 1972 with Portuguese Armed Forces. From 1972 to 1974 he starts a profitable fish transformation company using an innovative technique for artificial drying. In 1975 he relocates to Lisbon with his first wife and daughter.\nOnce in Portugal he enters business and travels across the Middle East, particularly Kuwait, Irak, Iran and Algeria. In 1980, in Egypt, he met his second wife, daughter of an Italian businessman in the construction and infrastructure sector. In 1982, he participates in an international cooperation project to develop vocational training in Algeria. In 1985, he leaves for the former USSR, where he participates in the construction of tannery factories and shoe factories, then requested by the Soviet government.\n\nIn 1991 Hélder Bataglia returns to Portugal. The following year, the Espírito Santo Group (GES) appoints him to create Escom Group, an investment company to support GES transactions in Angola. These activities were then expanded to the Republic of the Congo, South Africa (2009) and Mozambique (2011) where he founded Networx. Since 2013, Hélder Bataglia has been working with international investment funds with the aim of creating projects the infrastructure and transportation sectors in Africa, particularly in Angola, Mozambique and the Republic of the Congo. Since 2004 Hélder Bataglia has a pivotal role in the straightening of ties between China and Angola by facilitating contacts between both countries via the Escom, \"China Beya Escom International Limited\" and Sonangol, the Angolan public oil production company.\n\nIn 2004, Escom provides assistance to German Submarine Consortium (GSG) in defining the compensation incentives included in . The success of the transaction provides Escom with a 2.5% profit on the sale price, €25 million. The Public prosecution in Portugal ordered an inquiry into the process due to suspicions of bribery and corruption, later confirmed by German authorities. Escom's board of directors was heard several times, but no proof was noticed apart from the fact that Battaglia was involved in money transfers that were the starting point of investigations. The latest hearing by the chairman of the Parliament's investigatory committee, held on 25 August 2014, brought an end to a decade-long investigation, clearing Helder Bataglia of any wrongdoing in the case, even though he has been associated to it both by German authorities and business partners that testified that Bataglia has received funds, as well as in the Panama Papers scandal.\n\nIn 1995, Hélder Bataglia establishes the NGO \"Apoiar África\" (Aid Africa), operating in Mozambique and Angola, primarily in the area of education. One of its first humanitarian acts was to support the opening of an orphanage in Angola. Escom Group carries out corporate social responsibility activities in Angola, particularly in basic education and adult literacy in mining areas where the Group operates, as well as, supporting projects for primary health care in the communities. Hélder Bataglia was awarded the title of Commander of the Order of Prince Henry of Portugal in 2007. He was also awarded the Order of Merit by the President of the Republic of the Congo. In 2012, Hélder Bataglia publishes a book in English, Portrait of a New Angola, which illustrates the state of reconstruction and the economic boost of the new Angola, including photographs by Francesca Galliani and Walter Fernandes.\n"}

In the US, independent outsiders make up 66% of all boards and 72% of S&P 500 company boards, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe NYSE and NASDAQ stock exchange standards for independent directors are similar. Both require that \"a majority of the board of directors of a listed company be 'independent,'\" Both allow compensation for directors of $120,000/year or less (as of August 2008).)\n\nThe NYSE states: \n\"no director qualifies as 'independent' unless the board of directors affirmatively determines that the director has 'no material relationship' with the listed company, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company.\"\n\nNasdaq's rules say that an independent director must not be an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship that, in the opinion of the company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.\n\nAccording to the Conference Board, \"other than delisting a company ... there really is no penalty\" by the stock exchanges or the SEC for not having enough independent directors.\n\nIn India as of 2017, a majority of the minimum two directors of public companies having share capital in excess of Rs. 100 million (Rs 100,000,000) should be independent. Clause 49 of the listing agreements defines independent directors as follows: \"For the purpose of this clause the expression 'independent directors' means directors who apart from receiving director's remuneration, do not have any other material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the company, its promoters, its management or its subsidiaries, which in judgment of the board may affect independence of judgment of the directors.\"\n\nThe Companies Act, 2013, most sections of which got implemented from 1 April 2014, has mandated all listed public companies to have at least one-third of the total Directors to be independent. Whereas in the case of unlisted public companies, the following class of companies shall have at least two directors as independent directors:\n\n(i) Public Companies having paid up share capital of Ten Crore rupees or more; or\n(ii) Public Companies having turnover of One Hundred Crore rupees or more; or\n(iii) Public Companies which have, in aggregate, outstanding loans, debentures and deposits exceeding 50 Crore rupees or more.\n\nThe Companies Act, 2013 is drafted taking into consideration the noteworthy inputs and contribution that an Independent Director can bring in to the business. Section 149(6) of the act stipulates the criteria for a candidate that ensures highest standards of integrity, while also preventing any conflict of interest. The provisions seek to ensure the autonomy of the appointee to facilitate effective discharge of duties such as upholding shareholders' interest, upholding corporate governance standards, among others. The compensation offered to such Independent Directors in the form of \"sitting fee\" has also been increased from Rs. 20,000 (prescribed by Companies Act, 1956) to a maximum of Rs. 1,00,000/- per meeting.\n\nThe requirements in Kenya are similar to those in India. (These are to be found in the Companies Act, Cap 486 Laws of Kenya).<George Kinyua, LL.B>\n\nSome researchers have complained that firms have appointed \"independent directors who are overly sympathetic to\nmanagement, while still technically independent according to regulatory definitions.\"\n\nOne complaint against the independence regulations is that CEOs may find loopholes to influence directors. While the NYSE has a $1 million limit on business dealing between directors and the firm, this does not include charitable contributions. Two critics of management influence over boards note that \"a director who is an officer or employee of a charitable organization can still be considered independent even if the firm on whose board the director sits contributes more than $1 million to that organization.\"\n\n\n"}

Pastor eventually started his own company, – J.B. Pastor & Fils – in 1920, and won the contracts to build Monaco's water supply system. In 1936, Prince Louis II of Monaco awarded Pastor and his company J.B. Pastor & Fils, the commission to build the country's first football stadium. The Stade Louis II was finished in 1939 and had a capacity of 12,000.\n\nWith his newfound wealth, Pastor bought seafront land at low prices after World War II, particularly in the Larvotto district, when there was still no development east of the casino. With the post-war tourism slump, Prince Rainier resolved to diversify from gambling and turned Monaco into a tax haven.

{"id": "2594158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2594158", "title": "Labour supply", "text": "Labour supply\n\nIn mainstream economic theories, the labour supply is the total hours (adjusted for intensity of effort) that workers wish to work at a given real wage rate. It is frequently represented graphically by a labour supply curve, which shows hypothetical wage rates plotted vertically and the amount of labour that an individual or group of individuals is willing to supply at that wage rate plotted horizontally.\n\nLabour supply curves derive from the 'labour-leisure' trade-off. More hours worked earn higher incomes, but necessitate a cut in the amount of leisure that workers enjoy. Consequently, there are two effects on the amount of labour desired to be supplied due to a change in the real wage rate. As, for example, the real wage rate rises, the opportunity cost of leisure increases. This tends to make workers supply more labour (the \"substitution effect\"). However, also as the real wage rate rises, workers earn a higher income for a given number of hours. If leisure is a normal good—the demand for it increases as income increases—this increase in income tends to make workers supply less labour so they can \"spend\" the higher income on leisure (the \"income effect\"). If the substitution effect is stronger than the income effect then the labour supply slopes upward. If, beyond a certain wage rate, the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect, then the labour supply curve bends backward. Individual labor supply curves can be aggregated to derive the total labour supply of an economy.\n\nFrom a Marxist perspective, a labour supply is a core requirement in a capitalist society. To avoid labour shortage and ensure a labour supply, a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-provisioning, which would let them be independent—and they must instead, to survive, be compelled to sell their labour for a subsistence wage. In the pre-industrial economies wage labour was generally undertaken only by those with little or no land of their own.\n\n\n"}

The last update (1.1.9) was renamed \"Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe\". In 2009 Electronic Arts published an iPhone version of \"Lemonade Tycoon\". \"Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition\" is also available on Mac OS X, published by MacPlay.\n\nWhile selling lemonade, players must look over many aspects of their business. Players decide on a recipe, set prices, and sell lemonade in a variety of locations. The game includes changing weather and news, which the player must compensate for. To overcome some factors, such as long lines and stock, players can buy upgrades. The packaged version included versions for PC, Mobile Phones, Windows Mobile Professional devices, and Palm devices. The game allows players to transfer game saves from a Windows PC to a Palm handheld or Windows Mobile Professional device and back again to continue.\n\n\"Lemonade Tycoon\" has similarities to \"Lemonade Stand\", a computer game originally created for the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium in 1973 and later ported by Apple Computer for use with its then-new Apple II platform in 1979. The game also required players to make businesses decisions based upon weather, customers, and cost/availability of stock.\n\n\"Lemonade Tycoon\" includes three game modes; Career, Challenge and Champion. Career mode lets the player have a stand for as long as they want. Challenge mode had a 30-day limit to see how fast your stand can grow within the period of time.\n\nIn order to be able to sell lemonade, players have to buy supplies, which include ice, lemons, sugar, and cups.\n\nThe player has the option to advertise in \"Lemonade Tycoon\". Every day, the player can pay an advertising fee with different choices in advertising being available. Advertising increases the number of potential customers.\n\nLemonade Tycoon features many upgrades that are available at different prices. Some reduce wait times, some improve visibility, some make ice, etc. Stand upgrades allow more storage and customer capacity. There are also employees, a cashier, and a clown, which charge daily for reducing wait times and increasing patience, respectively.\n\nThere are five different locations where one can move your stand. Some places are more popular than others. Each location has a different rent. Each location has satisfaction and popularity. Popularity changes as the player's stand gets more popular. Good satisfaction and advertising bring more customers. Satisfaction ensures that customers will come back to the stand. If there are short lines, there are good prices, the player serves all customers rather than them leaving, and the player has a good recipe, the player's customer satisfaction will go up. With the increase of satisfaction, customers will come back to a player's stand. Satisfaction and popularity are location based. They do not travel with you as you move from location to location.\n\nThere are many News Headlines that affect the success of lemonade sales. Some headlines improve the player's business and some hurt it. Headlines change every game day and sometimes only affect a single location. Weather also affects sales - warm and hot days bring more customers than cold, rainy days. The weather changes each day and does not seem to follow predictable patterns.\n\nThe Lemonade Stock Exchange was an online feature that let one see how one's stand compared to others.\n\n\nLearning Planet, an educational website, created the original version of the game for teaching economics and resource management for its students. The LearningPlanet.com version of Lemonade Tycoon is visually different but functionally identical to the other iterations of the game.\n"}

She was also the second wife and widow of businessman John Jacob Astor IV.\n\nMadeleine Talmage Force was born on June 19, 1893, in Brooklyn, New York, the younger daughter of William Hurlbut Force (1852–1917) and the former Katherine Arvilla Talmage (1863–1930). Madeleine's elder sister Katherine Emmons Force was a real estate businesswoman and socialite. Through their father William, she and Katherine had French ancestry and were grandnieces of builder Ephraim S. Force (1822 – March 12, 1914). Their mother Katherine had Dutch ancestry.\n\nWilliam Hurlbut Force was a member of a well-established business family. He owned the successful shipping firm William H. Force and Co., and his father had been prosperous in the manufacturing industry. In 1889, Force had married Katherine Talmage, who was the granddaughter of former Brooklyn mayor Thomas Talmage. The Forces were part of Brooklyn high society, while William Force was a member of numerous prestigious clubs in the city. He also owned a notable art collection. Like the Astor family, the Forces were members of the Episcopal Church.\n\nShe was educated at Miss Ely's School and then for four years at Miss Spence's School, which was located at West 48th Street in Manhattan. According to one report she was \"counted an especially brilliant pupil\" at this school. She was also taken abroad with her sister Katherine by her mother and toured Europe several times. When she was introduced to New York social life she was immediately adopted by the \"Junior League\" which was a clique of debutantes. She appeared in several New York society plays and attracted quite a following. She was known to be a very competent horsewoman and enjoyed yachting. One report said that she was bright and good with drawing-room conversation.\n\nShe met Colonel John Jacob \"Jack\" Astor IV, the only son of businessman William Backhouse Astor, Jr. and socialite Caroline Webster \"Lina\" Schermerhorn. During their courtship he took her on automobile drives and yacht trips and they were often followed by the press. They became engaged in August 1911 and were married on September 9, 1911. There was a considerable amount of opposition to his marriage not only because of their age difference but because of his recent divorce (November 1909) from his previous wife. Several Episcopal priests refusing to celebrate the nuptials, the couple were eventually married by a Congregationalist minister at Beechwood, his Newport mansion. His son William Vincent Astor served as best man.\n\nAfter their marriage, they had an extended honeymoon. They visited several places locally first, then in January 1912, they sailed from New York on the \"Titanic\"’s sister ship, the \"Olympic\", and enjoyed a long Egyptian tour. It was while returning from this part of their honeymoon that they booked their passage on the \"Titanic\".\n\nMadeleine Astor, then five months pregnant, boarded the \"Titanic\" as a first-class passenger in Cherbourg, France, with her husband; her husband's valet, Victor Robbins; her maid, Rosalie Bidois; and her nurse, Caroline Endres. They also took Kitty, Astor's pet Airedale, and occupied one of the parlor suites. On the night of April 14, 1912, Colonel Astor reported to his wife that the ship had hit an iceberg. He reassured her that the damage did not appear serious, though he helped her strap on her lifebelt. While they were waiting on the boat-deck, Mrs. Astor lent Leah Aks, a third-class passenger, her fur shawl to keep her son, Filly, warm. At one point, the Astors retired to the gymnasium and sat on the mechanical horses in their lifebelts. Colonel Astor found another lifebelt which he reportedly cut with a pen knife to show Madeleine what it was made of. When it was time to board a life boat, Madeleine Astor, her maid, and her nurse had to crawl through the first-class promenade window into the tilting lifeboat 4 (which had been lowered down to A deck to take on more passengers). Astor had helped his wife to climb through the window and asked if he could accompany her as she was 'in a delicate condition'. The request was denied by Second Officer Charles Lightoller. An account of Madeleine's boarding of the lifeboat was given by Archibald Gracie IV to the US Senate Titanic inquiry. Gracie was a fellow passenger and recalled the events regarding Madeleine Astor in the following terms.\n\n\"The only incident I remember in particular at this point is when Mrs Astor was put in the boat. She was lifted up through the window, and her husband helped her on the other side, and when she got in, her husband was on one side of this window and I was on the other side, at the next window. I heard Mr Astor ask the second officer whether he would not be allowed to go aboard this boat to protect his wife. He said, 'No, sir, no man is allowed on this boat or any of the boats until the ladies are off.' Mr Astor then said, 'Well, tell me what is the number of this boat so I may find her afterwards,' or words to that effect. The answer came back, 'No. 4.\".\n\nAstor and his valet died in the sinking; the former's body was recovered on April 22. He was found to be carrying approximately two thousand five hundred dollars in cash, brought with him from his cabin. His young widow and the other survivors were rescued by the RMS \"Carpathia\".\n\nMadeleine Astor gave an account of what she recalled almost immediately after her arrival home through her spokesman Nicholas Biddle who was a trustee of the Astor Estate. The account given by her spokesman is as follows.\n\n\"On landing from the Carpathia the young bride widowed by the Titanic's sinking told members of her family what she could recall of the circumstances of the disaster. Of how Colonel Astor had met his death she had no definite conception.\"\nShe recalled she thought that in the confusion as she was about to be put into one of the boats Colonel Astor was standing by her side. After that she had no very clear recollection of the happenings until the boats were well clear of the sinking steamer.\"\nMrs Astor, it appears, left in one of the last boats which got away from the ship. It was her belief that all the women who wished to go had then been taken off. Her impression was that the boat she left in had room for at least 15 more persons. The men, for some reason (that) she could not and does not now understand, did not seem to be at all anxious to leave the ship. Almost everyone seemed dazed.\"\n\nAfter Astor returned home from her ordeal, she was kept in strict retirement. Her first social function was not until the end of May when she held a luncheon at her mansion on Fifth Avenue for Arthur Rostron, the Captain of the \"Carpathia\", and Dr. Frank McGee, the ship’s surgeon. She held this event with Marian Thayer, who was also a survivor of the \"Titanic\". Both women wished to thank these men for their assistance when they were on board the \"Carpathia\".\n\nIn his will, John Jacob Astor IV left his wife an outright sum of $100,000. In addition, he bequeathed to her the income from a trust fund of $5 million and the use during her life of the house on Fifth Avenue. Both of these latter provisions, she would lose if she remarried. A fund of $3 million was set aside for his unborn child John Jacob \"Jakey\" Astor VI which he would control when he became of age. On August 14, 1912, Astor gave birth to Jakey at her Fifth Avenue mansion. For the next four years, she raised him as part of the Astor family. She did not seem to appear very often in society until the end of 1913, when according to the press they were able to publish her first photograph since the \"Titanic\" disaster.\n\nAfter this, she appeared more often in public and her activities were frequently reported in the press. In 1915, she remodelled her house on Fifth Avenue and this was made a feature article in the \"New York Sun\". There were also many articles about her eldest son.\n\nFour years after Colonel Astor's death, Madeleine Astor married her childhood friend banker William Karl Dick (May 28, 1888 – September 5, 1953) on June 22, 1916, in Bar Harbor, Maine. He was a vice president of the Manufacturers Trust Company of New York and a part owner and director of the \"Brooklyn Times\". As stated in Colonel Astor's will, she lost her stipend from his trust fund. They had two sons:\nThey divorced on July 21, 1933, in Reno, Nevada. Four months later, on November 27, 1933, Astor married Italian actor/boxer Enzo Fiermonte in a civil ceremony in New York City. They honeymooned in Palm Beach, Florida. They eventually moved there. They had no children together and divorced on June 11, 1938, in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nMadeleine Fiermonte died of a heart ailment at her mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, on March 27, 1940, at the age of 46. She was buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City, in a mausoleum with her mother.\n\n\n"}

Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, and was a sister of President of the United States John F. Kennedy, and Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy.\n\nRosemary experienced mental disabilities, and displayed less academic and sporting potential than her siblings; she was slower than all of her siblings when it came to achieving many tasks. However, her disabilities were carefully concealed from the public by her prominent family. In her early young adult years, she also had behavioral problems. Her father arranged one of the first prefrontal lobotomies for her at the age of 23, but it failed and left her permanently incapacitated. Rosemary spent the rest of her life in an institution in Jefferson, Wisconsin, with limited contact with her family or the outside world. Her condition may have inspired her sister, Eunice, to initiate the Special Olympics in 1962.\n\nRose Marie Kennedy was born at her parents' home in Brookline, Massachusetts. She was the third child and first daughter of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald. She was named after her mother, and commonly called \"Rosemary\" or \"Rosie.\" During her birth, the doctor was not immediately available and the nurse ordered Rose Kennedy to keep her legs closed, forcing the baby's head to stay in the birth canal for two hours. The action resulted in a harmful loss of oxygen. As Rosemary began to grow, her parents noticed she was not reaching the basic development steps an infant or a toddler normally reach at a certain month or year. At two years old, she had a hard time sitting up, crawling, learning to walk and later on feeding herself.\n\nBy Massachusetts state law, the Binet intelligence test was given to her before first grade, as she twice failed to advance from kindergarten.\n\nRose Kennedy sent Rosemary to the Sacred Heart Convent in Elmhurst, Providence, Rhode Island, at age 15, where she was educated separately from the other students. Two nuns and a special teacher, Miss Newton, worked with her all day in a separate classroom. The Kennedys gave the school a new tennis court for their efforts. Her reading, writing, spelling, and counting skills were reported to be at a fourth-grade level, and she was slower to progress than her siblings. She studied but may have felt she disappointed her parents, whom she wanted to please. During this period, her mother arranged for her older brother John to accompany her to a tea-dance. Thanks to him, she appeared \"not different at all\" during the tea-dance.\n\nAccording to Henry H. Goddard, Rosemary suffered intellectual disabilities. She was deemed to have an IQ between 60 and 70. A biographer wrote that Rose Kennedy did not confide in her friends and that she pretended her daughter was developing typically, with relatives other than the immediate family knowing nothing of Rosemary's reported low IQ. Younger sister Eunice surmised from various doctors' visits to their home that Rosemary was both \"mentally ill\" and epileptic.\n\nDiaries written by her in the late 1930s, and published in the 1980s, reveal a young woman whose life was filled with outings to the opera, tea dances, dress fittings, and other social interests:\n\nShe read few books but could read \"Winnie-the-Pooh\". Yet, Rosemary managed to obtain a diploma from a Massachusetts two-year community college.\n\nKennedy was presented to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during her father's service as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Her father presented his daughters instead of, more customarily, choosing about thirty young American debutantes, a decision which earned him favor in the press. Kennedy's \"slowness\" was also unconventional and daring for a debut (two of the queen's nieces remained in a mental hospital because they were mentally ill). Young women would practice the rather complicated royal curtsey, sometimes learning the performance at the Vacani School of Dancing near Harrods. She practiced for hours. She wore a gown made of white tulle with a net train and carried a bouquet of lilies of the valley. Her sister Kathleen was described as \"stunning, but she was only a shadow of Rosemary's beauty.\" Just as Rosemary was about to \"glide off\" by stepping to the right, she tripped and nearly fell. Rose Kennedy never discussed the incident and treated the debut as a triumph. The crowd made no sign, the King and the Queen smiled as if nothing had happened, and it is unknown whether Rosemary was aware of her own stumble.\n\nOne Kennedy family biographer termed her \"absolutely beautiful\" with \"a gorgeous smile.\" At twenty, she was \"a picturesque young woman, a snow princess with flush cheeks, gleaming smile, plump figure, and a sweetly ingratiating manner to almost everyone she met.\" She enjoyed dancing, such as at her sister Kathleen's coming-out party. Kennedy's parents told \"Woman's Day\" that she was \"studying to be a kindergarten teacher,\" and \"Parents\" was told that while she had \"an interest in social welfare work, she is said to harbor a secret longing to go on the stage.\" \"The Boston Globe\" wrote requesting an interview which was refused, but her father's assistant Eddie Moore prepared a response, which Rosemary copied out laboriously, letter by letter:\n\nI have always had serious tastes and understand life is not given us just for enjoyment. For some time past, I have been studying the well known psychological method of Dr. Maria Montessori and I got my degree in teaching last year.\n\nPlacid and easygoing as a child and teenager, the maturing Rosemary Kennedy became increasingly assertive and rebellious. She was also reportedly subject to violent mood changes. Some observers have since attributed this behavior to her inability to conform to siblings who were expected to perform to high standards, as well as the hormonal surges associated with puberty. In any case, the family had difficulty dealing with her stormy moods and reckless behavior. Rosemary had begun to sneak out at night from the convent school in Washington, D.C., where she was cared for and educated. Her occasional erratic behavior frustrated her parents, who expected all of their children to behave appropriately, be goal-oriented, and act competitively. Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. was especially worried that his daughter's behavior would shame and embarrass the family and possibly damage his political career, and those of his children.\n\nIn November 1941, when Rosemary Kennedy was 23, doctors told Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. that a neurosurgical procedure, lobotomy, would help calm her mood swings and stop her occasional violent outbursts. He decided that his daughter should have the lobotomy performed; however, he did not inform his wife Rose of this until after the procedure was completed. Rosemary was strapped to the operating table. James W. Watts, who carried out the procedure with Walter Freeman of Wingdale Psychological and Correctional Facility, described what happened next (as narrated by Ronald Kessler):\n\nAfter the lobotomy, it quickly became apparent that the procedure was not successful. Kennedy's mental capacity diminished to that of a two-year-old child. She could not walk or speak intelligibly and was incontinent.\n\nAfter the procedure, Rosemary was immediately institutionalized. She initially lived for several years at Craig House, a private psychiatric hospital an hour north of New York City. In 1949, she was relocated to Jefferson, Wisconsin, where she lived for the rest of her life on the grounds of the St. Coletta School for Exceptional Children (formerly known as \"St. Coletta Institute for Backward Youth\").\n\nArchbishop Richard Cushing had told her father about St. Coletta's, an institution for more than three hundred people with disabilities, and her father traveled to and built a private house for her about a mile outside St. Coletta's main campus near Alverno House, which was designed for adults who needed lifelong care. The nuns called the house \"the Kennedy cottage\". Two Catholic nuns, Sister Margaret Ann and Sister Leona, provided her care along with a student and a woman who worked on ceramics with Rosemary three nights a week. Alan Borsari supervised the team and was able to call in specialists. Rosemary had a car that could be used to take her for rides and a dog whom she could take on walks.\n\nIn response to her condition, Rosemary's parents separated her from her family. Rose Kennedy did not visit her for twenty years. Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. did not visit his daughter at the institution. While her older brother John was campaigning for re-election for the Senate in 1958, the Kennedy family explained away her absence by claiming she was reclusive. The Kennedy family did not publicly explain her absence until 1961, after John had been elected President. The Kennedys did not reveal that she was institutionalized because of a failed lobotomy but instead said that she was deemed \"mentally retarded\".\n\nAfter the death of her father in 1969, Rosemary was occasionally taken to visit relatives in Florida and Washington, D.C., and to her childhood home on Cape Cod. By that time, Rosemary had learned to walk again but did so with a limp. She never regained the ability to speak clearly and her arm was palsied. Her condition is sometimes credited as the inspiration for Eunice Kennedy Shriver to later found the Special Olympics, although Shriver told \"The New York Times\" in 1995 that that was not the entire case. In 1983, the Kennedy family gave $1 million to renovate Alverno House. The gift added a therapeutic pool and enlarged the chapel.\n\nRosemary Kennedy died from natural causes on January 7, 2005, at the Fort Atkinson Memorial Hospital in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, at the age of 86, with her surviving siblings, sisters Jean, Eunice, and Patricia, and brother Ted, by her side. She was buried beside her parents in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts.\n\nShe was the first child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy to die from natural causes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Averell Harriman\n\nWilliam Averell Harriman (November 15, 1891July 26, 1986), better known as Averell Harriman, was an American Democratic politician, businessman, and diplomat. The son of railroad baron E. H. Harriman, he served as Secretary of Commerce under President Harry S. Truman and later as the 48th Governor of New York. He was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1952 and 1956, as well as a core member of the group of foreign policy elders known as \"The Wise Men\".\n\nWhile attending Groton School and Yale University, he made contacts that led to creation of a banking firm that eventually merged into Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.. He owned parts of various other companies, including Union Pacific Railroad, Merchant Shipping Corporation, and Polaroid Corporation. During the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harriman served in the National Recovery Administration and on the Business Advisory Council before moving into foreign policy roles. After helping to coordinate the Lend-Lease program, Harriman served as the ambassador to the Soviet Union and attended the major World War II conferences. After the war, he became a prominent advocate of George F. Kennan's policy of containment. He also served as Secretary of Commerce, and coordinated the implementation of the Marshall Plan.\n\nIn 1954, Harriman defeated Republican Senator Irving Ives to become the Governor of New York. He served a single term before his defeat by Nelson Rockefeller in the 1958 election. Harriman unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention and the 1956 Democratic National Convention. Though Harriman had Truman's backing at the 1956 convention, the Democrats nominated Adlai Stevenson II in both elections. \n\nAfter his gubernatorial defeat, Harriman became a widely respected foreign policy elder within the Democratic Party. He helped negotiate the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty during President John F. Kennedy's administration and was deeply involved in the Vietnam War during the Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson administrations. After Johnson left office in 1969, Harriman affiliated with various organizations, including the Club of Rome and the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBetter known as Averell Harriman, he was born in New York City, the son of railroad baron Edward Henry Harriman and Mary Williamson Averell. He was the brother of E. Roland Harriman and Mary Harriman Rumsey. Harriman was a close friend of Hall Roosevelt, the brother of Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nDuring the summer of 1899, Harriman's father organized the Harriman Alaska Expedition, a philanthropic-scientific survey of coastal Alaska and Russia that attracted 25 of the leading scientific, naturalist, and artist luminaries of the day, including John Muir, John Burroughs, George Bird Grinnell, C. Hart Merriam, Grove Karl Gilbert, and Edward Curtis, along with 100 family members and staff, aboard the steamship \"George Elder\". Young Harriman would have his first introduction to Russia, a nation on which he would spend a significant amount of attention in his later life in public service.\n\nHe attended Groton School in Massachusetts before going on to Yale where he joined the Skull and Bones society. He graduated in 1913. After graduating, he inherited one of the largest fortunes in America and became Yale's youngest Crew coach.\n\nUsing money from his father he established W.A. Harriman & Co banking business in 1922. In 1927 his brother Roland joined the business and the name was changed to Harriman Brothers & Company. In 1931, it merged with Brown Bros. & Co. to create the highly successful Wall Street firm Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. Notable employees included George Herbert Walker and his son-in-law Prescott Bush.\n\nHarriman's main properties included Brown Brothers & Harriman & Co, Union Pacific Railroad, Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, and venture capital investments that included the Polaroid Corporation. Harriman's associated properties included the Southern Pacific Railroad (including the Central Pacific Railroad), Illinois Central Railroad, Wells Fargo & Co., the Pacific Mail Steamship Co., American Ship & Commerce, Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Aktiengesellschaft (HAPAG), the American Hawaiian Steamship Co., United American Lines, the Guaranty Trust Company, and the Union Banking Corporation.\n\nHe served as Chairman of The Business Council, then known as the Business Advisory Council for the United States Department of Commerce in 1937 and 1939.\n\nHarriman's older sister, Mary Rumsey, encouraged Averell to leave his finance job and work with her and their friends, the Roosevelts, to advance the goals of the New Deal. Averell joined the NRA National Recovery Administration, the first government consumer rights group, marking the beginning of his political career.\n\nFollowing the death of August Belmont, Jr., in 1924, Harriman, George Walker, and Joseph E. Widener purchased much of Belmont's thoroughbred breeding stock. Harriman raced under the nom de course of Arden Farm. Among his horses, Chance Play won the 1927 Jockey Club Gold Cup. He also raced in partnership with Walker under the name Log Cabin Stable before buying him out. U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Louis Feustel, trainer of Man o' War, trained the Log Cabin horses until 1926.\nOf the partnership's successful runners purchased from the August Belmont estate, Ladkin is best remembered for defeating the European star Epinard in the International Special.\n\nHarriman's banking business was the main Wall Street connection for German companies and the varied U.S. financial interests of Fritz Thyssen; who was a financial backer of the Nazi party until 1938. The Trading With the Enemy Act (enacted on October 6, 1917) classified any business transactions for profit with enemy nations as illegal, and any funds or assets involved were subject to seizure by the U.S. government. The declaration of war on the U.S. by Hitler led to the U.S. government order on October 20, 1942 to seize German interests in the U.S. which included Harriman's operations in New York City.\n\nThe Harriman business interests seized under the act in October and November 1942 included:\n\nThe assets were held by the government for the duration of the war, then returned afterward; UBC was dissolved in 1951.\n\nCompensation for wartime losses in Poland were based on prewar assets. Harriman, who owned vast coal reserves in Poland, was handsomely compensated for them through an agreement between the American and Polish governments. Poles who had owned little but their homes received negligible sums.\n\nBeginning in the spring of 1941, Harriman served President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a special envoy to Europe and helped coordinate the Lend-Lease program. He was present at the meeting between FDR and Winston Churchill at Placentia Bay, in August 1941, which yielded the Atlantic Charter. It was a common declaration of principles of the United States and the UK; It was eventually endorsed by all of the Allies. Harriman was subsequently dispatched to Moscow to negotiate the terms of the Lend-Lease agreement with the Soviet Union. His promise of $1 billion in aid technically exceeded his brief. Determined to win over the doubtful American public, he used his own funds to purchase time on CBS radio to explain the program in terms of enlightened self-interest. This skepticism lifted with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nOn November 25, 1941 (twelve days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), he noted that \"The United States Navy is shooting the Germans—German submarines and aircraft at sea\".\n\nIn the summer of 1942, Harriman accompanied Churchill to the Moscow Conference to explain to Stalin why the western allies were carrying out operations in North Africa instead of opening the promised second front in France. Harriman was appointed as United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1943.\n\nAt the Tehran Conference in late 1943 Harriman was tasked with placating a suspicious Churchill while Roosevelt attempted to gain the confidence of Stalin. The conference highlighted the divisions between the United States and Britain about the postwar world. Churchill was intent on maintaining Britain's empire and carving the postwar world into spheres of influence while the United States upheld the principles of self-determination as laid out in the Atlantic Charter. Harriman mistrusted the Soviet leader's motives and intentions and opposed the spheres approach as it would give Stalin a free hand in eastern Europe.\n\nHarriman also attended the Yalta Conference, where he encouraged taking a stronger line with the Soviet Union—especially on questions of Poland. After Roosevelt's death, he attended the final \"Big Three\" conference at Potsdam. Although the new president, Harry Truman, was receptive to Harriman's anti-Soviet hard line advice, the new secretary of state, James Byrnes, managed to sideline him. While in Berlin, he noted the tight security imposed by Soviet military authorities and the beginnings of a program of reparations by which the Soviets were stripping out German industry.\n\nIn 1945, while Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Harriman was presented with a Trojan Horse gift. In 1952, the gift, a carved wood Great Seal of the United States, which had adorned \"the ambassador's Moscow residential office\" in Spaso House, was found to be bugged.\n\nHarriman served as ambassador to the Soviet Union until January 1946. When he returned to the United States, he worked hard to get George Kennan's Long Telegram into wide distribution. Kennan's analysis, which generally lined up with Harriman's, became the cornerstone of Truman's Cold War strategy of containment.\n\nFrom April to October 1946, he was ambassador to Britain, but he was soon appointed to become United States Secretary of Commerce under President Harry S. Truman to replace Henry A. Wallace, a critic of Truman's foreign policies. In 1948, he was put in charge of the Marshall Plan. In Paris, he became friendly with the CIA agent Irving Brown, who organised anti-communist unions and organisations. Harriman was then sent to Tehran in July 1951 to mediate between Iran and Britain in the wake of the Iranian nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.\n\nIn the 1954 race to succeed Republican Thomas E. Dewey as Governor of New York, Harriman defeated Dewey's protege, U.S. Senator Irving M. Ives, by a tiny margin. He served as governor for one term until Republican Nelson Rockefeller unseated him in 1958. As governor, he increased personal taxes by 11% but his tenure was dominated by his presidential ambitions. Harriman was a candidate for the Democratic Presidential Nomination in 1952, and again in 1956 when he was endorsed by Truman but lost (both times) to Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson.\n\nDespite the failure of his presidential ambitions, Harriman became a widely respected elder statesman of the party. In January 1961, he was appointed Ambassador at Large in the Kennedy administration, a position he held until November, when he became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs. In 1961, at the suggestion of Ambassador Charles W. Yost Harriman represented President Kennedy at the funeral of King Mohammed V of Morocco. During this period he advocated U.S. support of a neutral government in Laos and helped to negotiate the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. In December 1961, Anatoliy Golitsyn defected from the Soviet Union and accused Harriman of being a Soviet spy, but his claims were dismissed by the CIA and Harriman remained in his position until April 1963, when he became Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. He retained that position during the transition to the Johnson administration until March 1965 when he again became Ambassador at Large. He held that position for the remainder of Johnson's presidency. Harriman headed the U.S. delegation to the preliminary peace talks in Paris between the United States and North Vietnam (1968–69).\n\nPresident-elect Kennedy appointed Harriman as ambassador-at-large, to operate \"with the full confidence of the president and an intimate knowledge of all aspects of United States policy.\" But by 1963, Kennedy had come to suspect the loyalty of certain members on his national security team. According to Colonel William Corson, USMC, by 1963 Harriman was running \"Vietnam without consulting the president or the attorney general.\". Corson said Kenny O'Donnell, JFK's appointments secretary, was convinced that the National Security Advisor, McGeorge Bundy, followed the orders of Harriman rather than the president. Corson also claimed that O'Donnell was particularly concerned about Michael Forrestal, a young White House staffer who handled liaison on Vietnam with Harriman.\n\nHarriman certainly supported the coup against the South Vietnam president Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963. However, it is alleged that the orders that ended in the deaths of Diem and his brother actually originated with Harriman and were carried out by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.'s military assistant. The fundamental question about the murders was the sudden and unusual recall of Saigon Station Chief John \"Jocko\" Richardson by an unknown authority. Special Operations Army officer, John Michael Dunn, was sent to Vietnam in his stead. He followed the orders of Harriman and Forrestal rather than the CIA. According to Corson, Dunn's role in the incident has never been made public but he was assigned to Ambassador Lodge for \"special operations\" with the authority to act without hindrance; and he was known to have access to the coup plotters. Corson speculated that with Richardson recalled the way was clear for Dunn to freely act.\n\nHarriman received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Distinction, in 1969 and West Point's Sylvanus Thayer Award in 1975. Furthermore, in 1983 he received the Freedom Medal.\n\nIn 1973 he was interviewed in the now famous TV documentary series, \"The World at War\", where he gives a recollection of his experiences as Roosevelt's Personal Representative in Britain along with his views on Cold War politics; in particular Poland and the Warsaw Pact; along with the exchanges he witnessed between Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin. In one such recollection he describes Stalin as \"utterly cruel\".\n\nHarriman was appointed senior member of the US Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly's Special Session on Disarmament in 1978. He was also a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy Charter, Club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, Knights of Pythias, Skull and Bones Society, Psi Upsilon Fraternity, and the Jupiter Island Club.\n\nHis first marriage, two years after graduating from Yale, was to Kitty Lanier Lawrence. Lawrence was the great-granddaughter of James Lanier, a co-founder of Winslow, Lanier & Co., and the granddaughter of Charles D. Lanier (1837-1926), a close friend of Pierpont Morgan Before their divorce in 1928, and her death in 1936, Harriman and Lawrence had two daughters together:\n\n\nAbout a year after his divorce from Lawrence, he married Marie Norton Whitney (1903–1970), who had left her husband, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, to marry him. On their honeymoon in Europe, they purchased oil paintings by Van Gogh, Degas, Cézanne, Picasso, and Renoir. She and her husband later donated many of the works she bought and collected, including those of the artist Walt Kuhn, to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. They remained married until her death on September 26, 1970, at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1971, he married for the third and final time to Pamela Beryl Digby Churchill Hayward (1920–1997), the former wife of Winston Churchill's son Randolph, and widow of Broadway producer Leland Hayward. Harriman and Pamela Churchill had had an affair during the War in 1941 which led to the breakdown of her marriage to Randolph Churchill. In 1993, she became the 58th United States Ambassador to France.\n\nHarriman died on July 26, 1986 in Yorktown Heights, New York, at the age of 94. Averell and Pamela Harriman are buried at the Arden Farm Graveyard in Arden, New York.\n\nFor the state park in New York named after his parents, see Harriman State Park (New York).\nHarriman State Park is a state park in eastern Idaho, United States. It is located on an 11,000-acre (45 km2) wildlife refuge in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and is home to an abundance of elk, moose, sandhill cranes, trumpeter swans, and the occasional black or grizzly bear. Two-thirds of the trumpeter swans that winter in the contiguous United States spend the season in Harriman State Park. The land was deeded to Idaho for free in 1977 by Roland and W. Averell Harriman, whose insistence that the state have a professional park managing service helped prompt the creation of the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation in 1965. The park opened to the public in 1982. It is located in Fremont County, 3 miles (4.8 km) south of Island Park, Idaho. Henry's Fork, a fly-fishing stream, winds through the meadows of Harriman State Park. In winter, many of its roads and trails are groomed for cross country skiing.\n\n\n\n\n"}
