Mattei Lluberas' father's parents, who were of Corsican descent, sent him to France where he received his primary and secondary education.\n\nHe returned to Puerto Rico and became a wealthy businessman after he established a successful coffee plantation. He later married Ana María Rita Emmanuelli Negroni, the (daughter of Louis Henri Emanuelli Ciavaldini b 1824 Corsica and Ana Maria Negroni Rodriguez) and had three children: Rita María, Rita Monserrate and Luis Antonio.\n\nMattei Lluberas was among the many Puerto Ricans at the time who professed liberal ideals and believed that Puerto Rico should be an independent nation free from Spanish Colonial rule. As such, he became involved with the island's revolutionary movement and became one of their leaders. In 1896, Mattei Lluberas met with Mateo Mercado and a group of \"Yaucanos\" (as the natives of Yauco are known) who believed in full independence of Puerto Rico in \"Barrio Barinas\" of Yauco and made plans to overthrow the government. On December of that year, the local Civil Guard discovered their plans and proceeded to arrest all those involved who, besides Mercado and Mattei Lluberas, included Dario and Carlos Franchesi and Emiliano Lavergue, however they were soon released and returned to their respective homes.\n\nIn 1897, Mattei Lluberas visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with Ramon Emeterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio Méndez Martinez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising was to be directed by Betances, organized by Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Rius Rivera. At the time Rius Rivera, who joined José Martí's struggle for Cuban independence as a member of the Cuban Liberation Army, was the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army of the West.\n\nIn accordance to the plan, Mattei Lluberas purchased 30,000 machetes which were to be distributed amongst the rebels. Mattei Lluberas returned to Puerto Rico with a Puerto Rican flag and began to proceed with the plans of the revolt with his group. The Budet Rivera brothers established an insurgent training camp in the farm of Gullermo Velazco. Fellow rebels, Gerardo Forest Velez and Agustin F. Morales (himself a general in the Army of the Dominican Republic), were in charge of propaganda and traveled throughout the island seeking public support for their cause. Cuban revolutionist Tomas Estrada Palma, offered a contribution of 500 rifles with half a million rounds of ammunition and his comrade offered a steamship with an invading force of 200 men under the command of General Agustin F. Morales. The revolution was set for the beginning of the month of December 1897.\n\nThe Mayor of Yauco Francisco Lluch Barreras heard the rumors of the planned uprising, he immediately notified General Sabas Marín González the governor of the island.\n\nFidel Velez, a native of Sabana Grande and one of the separatist leaders, found out that the Spanish authorities knew about their plans and immediately held a meeting with Mattei Lluberas and the other leaders. Fearing that they all would soon be arrested, he demanded that the insurrection start immediately and not in December. In the discussion that followed, the other leaders did not agree with him, fearing that such a haste action would lead to the same disastrous results of \"El Grito de Lares\".\n\nOn March 24, 1897, Fidel Velez and his men met at Susua Arriba, just outside Yauco. They unfurled the Puerto Rican flag for the first time in Puerto Rican soil. and marched towards the town. They planned to attack the barracks of the Spanish Civil Guard with the aim of gaining control of the arms and ammunition which were stored there. The plan did not succeed because when they arrived they were ambushed by the Spanish forces who had set up positions and were waiting for them. A firefight ensued upon the arrival of the group and the rebels quickly retreated. On March 26, another group headed by Jose Nicolas Quiñones Torres and Ramon Torres attempted to fight the Spaniards in a barrio called \"Quebradas\" of Yauco, however said revolt also failed. Over 150 rebels were arrested, accused of various crimes against the state and sent to prison in the City of Ponce. Velez fled to St. Thomas where he lived in exile, while Mattei Lluberas went into exile in New York City and joined a group known as the \"Puerto Rican Commission\".\n\nMattei Lluberas and the Puerto Rican Commission in New York had been trying to convince President William McKinley to invade Puerto Rico for sometime. After Cuba was taken during the Spanish–American War, President McKinley approved the land invasion of Puerto Rico. A convoy of ships left Tampa, Florida and on July 21 another convoy departed from Guantánamo for a 4-day journey to Puerto Rico. Major General Nelson A. Miles, Commanding General of the Army, opted to land his troops in the southern region of the island, picking Guánica, at the time a part of the municipality of Yauco, as his landing zone. On July 31, 1898, Mattei Lluberas and his group arrived in Ponce aboard the USS \"St. Louis\" and were assigned to the headquarters of General Miles. On August 13, the Puerto Rican Campaign came to an end. Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, ratified on December 10, 1898, Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States.\n\nIn 1904, Mattei Lluberas was elected Mayor of Yauco as a candidate of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico. Mattei Lluberas died on January 15, 1908. The town of Yauco honored his memory by naming an avenue after him.\n\n"}

It has controversial applications in microeconomics (pump and dump strategy) and advertising.\n\nA demand is usually seen as artificial when it increases consumer utility very inefficiently; for example, a physician prescribing unnecessary surgeries would create artificial demand. Government spending with the primary purpose of providing jobs (rather than delivering any other end product) has been labelled \"artificial demand\". Similarly Noam Chomsky has suggested that unchecked militarism is a type of government-created artificial demand, a \"system of state planning ... oriented toward military production, in effect, the production of high technology waste\", with military Keynesianism or a powerful military industrial complex amounts to the \"creation of state-guaranteed markets for high technology waste (armaments).\"\n\nVehicles of creating artificial demand can include mass media advertising, which can create demand for goods, services, political policies or platforms, and other entities.\n\nAnother example of artificial demand can be seen in penny stock spam. After purchasing a large number of shares of an extremely low-value stock, the spammer attempts to create artificial demand by implementing a spam-based guerrilla marketing strategy.\n\n"}

Candler Jr.\n\nAsa Griggs \"Buddy\" Candler Jr. (August 27, 1880 – January 11, 1953, Atlanta) was the eccentric son of Asa Griggs Candler, co-founder of Coca-Cola. Candler Jr. helped build his father's business into an empire. He later became a real-estate developer, opening the Briarcliff Hotel at the corner of Ponce de Leon Avenue and N. Highland Ave. in Virginia Highland.\n\nAsa Jr. attended Emory College at its original campus in Oxford, Georgia and was a classmate of the future vice president Alben W. Barkley. After graduation he helped set up bottling plants for Coca-Cola across North America. He also supervised construction of various office buildings in Atlanta and of Candler Airport, now known as the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n\nIn 1910, Candler moved from the fashionable Inman Park neighborhood where his father also had a mansion, to a \"ramshackle\" farmhouse on Briarcliff Farm, on Williams Mill Road in what is now the Druid Hills neighborhood near Atlanta. Williams Mill Road was renamed Briarcliff Road in the 1920s after the estate that Candler built there. The farm was just north of Callanwolde, his brother Charles Howard Candler's estate. Candler Jr. managed a huge agricultural operation which provided meat and produce to local retailers. Cows, sheep, pigs, and chickens were raised on the farm. During World War I, Briarcliff Farm supplied milk to Fort Gordon.\n\nThe farm was lauded for its use of electric lights and fans, even individual drinking fountains for the cows, its cleanliness, and its air and light, resulting in sanitary conditions that led to higher yields and quality.\n\nIn 1916 he began plans to turn the farm into an estate with a mansion, Briarcliff. Briarcliff was built between 1920 and 1922, and featured a Georgian Revival exterior. Architect Dan Bodin assisted Frazier in overseeing the completion. In 1925 Candler had the mansion enlarged, including the music room, now DeOvies Hall, with its vaulted Tudor interior, limestone fireplace and painted walls.\n\nHis father and older brother had Aeolian organs, and to outdo them, in 1925 Candler had a $94,000, 88-rank, 187-stop, cathedral-sized Aeolian installed in the music room. It was the largest privately owned organ in Georgia at the time, and the 8th largest that Aeolian had ever built for a private residence. It was inaugurated in November 1925 in a recital by family friend Palmer Christian, which was broadcast over radio station WSB. IN 1952 the organ was given to Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia. It was renovated in 2008 and is now known as the Goodwyn-Candler-Panoz organ.\n\nThe mansion also included a golf course, two swimming pools (one open to the public for 25 cents per person), and a private zoo.\n\nThe Candlers sold their estate to the General Services Administration in 1948. The planned veterans' hospital never emerged, and the estate was used to house the Georgian Clinic (later the DeKalb County Addiction Center), the first alcohol treatment facility in Georgia - poignant as Asa Jr. was a severe alcoholic himself. Later the complex housed the Georgia Mental Health Institute. The complex is now the Briarcliff campus of Emory University.\n\nCandler lived out his later life in the penthouse of the Briarcliff Hotel, and was buried in Westview Cemetery.\n\nCandler was a big game hunter and aviation enthusiast. He participated in many local and national air races.\n\nAnother hobby was magic and sleight of hand tricks which he learned on his travels to China and India. A 1930 report described how his mansion had a room full of equipment for magic shows, and that every spring he would hold a \"high-jinks\" magic show and party for friends.\n\nHe was an alcoholic and suffered from depression.\n\nCandler collected exotic birds and animals in a menagerie held at his estate with cages designed by architect Bodin. He may have bought the animals while traveling in Europe from a down-and-out circus owner. The collection included a Bengal tiger, four lions, a black leopard, a gorilla, baboons, and six elephants: Coca, Cola, Pause, Refreshes, Refreshing, and Delicious. In 1935 Candler was in financial trouble. He put up his pipe organ for sale. \n\nCandler's neighbor sued him and won a $10,000 settlement because \"a baboon jumped over the wall of the zoo and devoured $60 in currency out of her purse\". He gave away his entire menagerie of animals to the Atlanta City zoo at Grant Park (now Zoo Atlanta).\n\nCandler's first marriage was in 1901 to Helen Magill, daughter of the late Col. John H. Magill, former editor of the Hartwell, Georgia \"Sun\" and Laura Eberhardt Magill. Helen was \"a leading figure in local social and civic circles\" in Atlanta both before and during her marriage active in the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Fine Arts club, the Atlanta Woman's club, and the Atlanta Garden club. Helen was frequently lauded in the local press for her elegant \"toilets\", a term used at the time for dresses or gowns. Helen died in January 1927, aged 40. Asa Jr.'s uncle Bishop Warren Akin Candler officiated at her funeral, and she was buried, as her husband later was, in Westview Cemetery.\n\nIn October 1927 Bishop Warren Candler married Asa Jr. to his second wife Florence Adeline Stephenson of Lithonia, Georgia, who for nine years had been his secretary.\n\nAsa and Helen's children included three sons, Asa G. III, who died at 7 months of age, John H. (1905–1947), who moved to Baltimore, and Samuel, who remained in Atlanta. They had four daughters: Laura, Helen, Martha, and Lucy.\n\nAsa was a member of the Atlanta First United Methodist Church at 360 Peachtree Street. A 1951 interview states that his alcoholism, depression, and other troubles were mitigated by a \"surrender to God.\"\n\n"}

His father was a herbalist, and he trained under him and joined the family business of dispensing herbal medicines. The Tamrakars had given up their ancestral occupation generations ago.

The company is headquartered in Chicago.\n\nBDO USA, LLP was founded as Seidman and Seidman in New York City in 1910 by three immigrant brothers: Maximillian L. Seidman, Francis E. Seidman, and Jacob S. Seidman. At that time the accounting profession was in its infancy, with fewer than 2,200 practicing CPAs in the United States. Shortly thereafter in 1913, the 16th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, followed by the Revenue Act of 1913 with new impositions of U.S. Federal income tax enacted by Congress in that year. M. L. Seidman saw the potential of the accountant's role to provide tax services to individuals. By 1917, Congress enacted the first revenue bills and the U.S. entry into World War I created the need for corporate income and excess profit taxes. At the same time, federal spending rose to $18.9 billion with 58 percent of the federal revenues provided from income taxes. M.L. Seidman and his siblings, who joined him in his new accounting firm, seized the opportunity to provide tax services to businesses in addition to individuals.\n\nAn era of expansion began. Fostered by the federal government's conversion of furniture and woodworking companies to aircraft production for the war effort, the firm opened an office in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1917. Seidman and Seidman quickly established itself as a leader in serving the furniture industry by developing the first effective furniture plant costing system. Today, BDO Seidman's Furniture Industry practice remains in the industry.\n\nIn 1925, the firm rapidly expanded, opening offices in Jamestown, Illinois, and Rockford, Illinois, followed by Chicago in 1921, and Gardner, Massachusetts in 1924. In 1922, J. S. Seidman joined the firm as a founding member.\n\nThe 1930s brought another new beginning for the accounting profession. In 1933, Congress passed the Securities Act, requiring public corporations to have financial statements included in registration statements and periodic reports reported on by independent CPAs. A year later, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to administer the new legislation.\n\nIn 1950, L. William Seidman joined the firm and ultimately became its managing partner before leaving for government service, most notably as Chair of the FDIC.\n\nThe firm continued to grow and by the 1960s, truly became a national firm. On April 1, 1968, the firm was converted into a national general partnership. This marked the beginning of a new era of expansion. Over the years to the present, the firm established many offices throughout the United States. Founding Partner Keith Beresheim was instrumental in helping BDO grow its practice and become a national tier firm.\n\nToday, BDO USA, LLP has more than 60 offices and more than 400 independent Alliance firm locations nationwide. During this timeframe, BDO International was created and has grown to become the fifth largest accounting and consulting network in the world with over 1,400 Member Firm offices in 135 countries.\n\nIn February 2009, BDO USA, LLP launched the firm's first-ever national advertising campaign: \"PEOPLE WHO KNOW, KNOW BDO\".\n\nIn June 2012, the Monitor (Joseph A. Smith, Jr.) of the National Mortgage Settlement announced he engaged BDO USA, LLP as his primary professional firm. BDO will join the Monitor and his team for a period of three and a half years as they oversee implementation of the historic National Mortgage Settlement involving 49 states, the United States government and five of the nation's largest banks.\n\nBDO has been involved in a number of engagements which resulted in major litigation and press attention.\n\nA group of DC government employees had embezzled funds by fraudulently issuing real estate tax refund checks to their friends. BDO Seidman was the independent auditor of the DC government's financial records. On November 21, 2007, Reuters wrote \"Washington, D.C., officials should fix problems identified in an audit that found the city mishandled millions of dollars, according to Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the U.S. capital in Congress ... The audit, conducted by accounting firm BDO Seidman, LLP, found that financial reporting for the city's school system and Medicaid programs did not match their financial statements, making both areas vulnerable to fraud ... Altogether, auditors found more than 160 instances where the city failed to comply with conditions for spending federal money, primarily by misreporting funds and mismanaging cash.\" As of November 2007, it was estimated that over $30 million were scammed by Washington, DC tax officials since 1999. At the height of the scam, half of the property tax refund checks were fraudulent. The average legitimate check was less than $10,000 while the average scam check was over $300,000. \"The scandal may also singe BDO Seidman, a private audit firm that gave [Washington DC CFO Natwar] Gandhi its seal of approval earlier this year. Its auditors were paid millions to go over the city's books and gave Gandhi's office an unqualified opinion.\" In 2010, a mentally ill woman, who was not a DC employee was able to exploit a security loophole in DC's financial systems to file tax returns claiming $19.1 million in refunds, but these were stopped.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, in connection with the Bernard Madoff scandal, the New York Law School filed a lawsuit against J. Ezra Merkin, Ascot Partners, and its auditor BDO Seidman, after losing its $3 million investment in Ascot. The lawsuit charged Merkin with recklessness, gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duties.\n\n"}
{"id": "246816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246816", "title": "Blue-collar worker", "text": "Blue-collar worker\n\nIn many countries, a blue-collar worker is a working class person who performs manual labor. Blue-collar work may involve skilled or unskilled manufacturing, mining, sanitation, custodial work, textile manufacturing, commercial fishing, food processing, oil field work, waste disposal, and recycling, construction, mechanic, maintenance, warehousing, technical installation, and many other types of physical work. Blue-collar work often involves something being physically built or maintained.\n\nIn contrast, the white-collar worker typically performs work in an office environment and may involve sitting at a computer or desk. A third type of work is a service worker (pink collar) whose labor is related to customer interaction, entertainment, sales or other service-oriented work. Many occupations blend blue, white, or pink industry categorizations.\n\nBlue-collar work is often paid hourly wage-labor, although some professionals may be paid by the project or salaried. There is a wide range of payscales for such work depending upon field of specialty and experience.\n\nThe term \"blue collar\" was first used in reference to trades jobs in 1924, in an Alden, Iowa newspaper. The phrase stems from the image of manual workers wearing blue denim or chambray shirts as part of their uniforms. Industrial and manual workers often wear durable canvas or cotton clothing that may be soiled during the course of their work. Navy and light blue colors conceal potential dirt or grease on the worker's clothing, helping him or her to appear cleaner. For the same reason, blue is a popular color for boilersuits which protect workers' clothing. Some blue collar workers have uniforms with the name of the business and/or the individual's name embroidered or printed on it.\n\nHistorically, the popularity of the color blue among manual laborers contrasts with the popularity of white dress shirts worn by people in office environments. The blue collar/white collar color scheme has socio-economic class connotations. However, this distinction has become blurred with the increasing importance of skilled labor, and the relative increase in low-paying white-collar jobs.\n\nSince many blue-collar jobs consist of mainly manual labor, educational requirements for workers are typically lower than those of white-collar workers. Often, only a high school diploma is required, and many of the skills required for blue-collar jobs will be learned by the employee while working. In higher level jobs, vocational training or apprenticeships may be required, and for workers such as electricians and plumbers, state-certification is also necessary.\n\nWith the information revolution, Western nations have moved towards a service and white collar economy. Many manufacturing jobs have been offshored to developing nations which pay their workers lower wages. This offshoring has pushed formerly agrarian nations to industrialized economies and concurrently decreased the number of blue-collar jobs in developed countries.\n\nIn the United States, blue collar and service occupations generally refer to jobs in precision production, craft, and repair occupations; machine operators and inspectors; transportation and moving occupations; handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers, and laborers.\n\nIn the United States, an area known as the Rust Belt comprising the Northeast and Midwest, including Western New York and Western Pennsylvania, has seen its once large manufacturing base shrink significantly. With the de-industrialization of these areas starting in the mid-1960s cities like Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Buffalo, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Erie, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; Toledo, Ohio, Rochester, New York, and St. Louis, Missouri, have experienced a steady decline of the blue-collar workforce and subsequent population decreases. Due to this economic osmosis, the rust belt has experienced high unemployment, poverty, and urban blight.\n\nDue to many blue-collar jobs involving manual labor and relatively unskilled workers, automation poses a threat of unemployment for blue-collar workers. One study from the MIT Technology Review estimates that 83% of jobs that make less than $20 per hour are threatened by automation. Some examples of technology that threaten workers are self-driving cars and automated cleaning devices, which could place blue-collar workers such as truck drivers or janitors out of work.\n\nOthers have suggested that technological advancement will not lead to blue-collar job unemployment, but rather shifts in the types of work that blue-collar workers currently do. Some foresee computer coding as becoming the blue-collar job of the future. Proponents of this idea view coding as a skill that can be learned through vocational training, and suggest that more coders will be needed in a technologically advancing world. Others see future of blue-collar work as humans and computers working together to improve efficiency. Such jobs would consist of data-tagging and labeling.\n\nBlue-collar workers have played a large role in electoral politics. In the 2016 United States Presidential election, many attributed Donald Trump's victories in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan to blue-collar workers, who overwhelmingly favored Trump over opponent Hillary Clinton. Amongst white-working class citizens, Trump won 64% of the votes, compared to only 32% for Clinton. This was the largest margin of victory amongst this group of voters for any presidential candidate since 1980.\n\nMany attributed Trump's success amongst this bloc of voters to his opposition of international trade deals and environmental regulations, two of the largest threats to blue-collar employment. Opponents of this view believe Trump's success with this bloc had more to do with an anti-immigrant and nationalist platform that supports deportation and discourages investment in higher education.\n\n\"Blue-collar\" can be used as an adjective to describe the environment of the blue-collar worker such as a \"blue-collar\" neighborhood, restaurant, or bar.\n\n"}

With for-profit entities, external stakeholders include investors and customers, for non-profits, external stakeholders refer to donors and clients, for government agencies, external stakeholders are the tax-payers, higher-level government agencies, and international lending bodies such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, various economic agencies of the United Nations, and development banks.\n\nInternally-focused business plans target intermediate goals required to reach the external goals. They may cover the development of a new product, a new service, a new IT system, a restructuring of finance, the refurbishing of a factory or a restructuring of the organization. An internally-focused business plan is often developed in conjunction with a balanced scorecard or a list of critical success factors. This allows success of the plan to be measured using non-financial measures. \n\nBusiness plans that identify and target internal goals, but provide only general guidance on how they will be met are called strategic plans.\n\nOperational plans describe the goals of an internal organization, working group or department. Project plans, sometimes known as project frameworks, describe the goals of a particular project. They may also address the project's place within the organization's larger strategic goals.\n\nBusiness plans are decision-making tools. The content and format of the business plan is determined by the goals and audience. For example, a business plan for a non-profit might discuss the fit between the business plan and the organization's mission. Banks are quite concerned about defaults, so a business plan for a bank loan will build a convincing case for the organization's ability to repay the loan. Venture capitalists are primarily concerned about initial investment, feasibility, and exit valuation. A business plan for a project requiring equity financing will need to explain why current resources, upcoming growth opportunities, and sustainable competitive advantage will lead to a high exit valuation.\n\nPreparing a business plan draws on a wide range of knowledge from many different business disciplines: finance, human resource management, intellectual property management, supply chain management, operations management, and marketing, among others. It can be helpful to view the business plan as a collection of sub-plans, one for each of the main business disciplines.\n\n\"... a good business plan can help to make a good business credible, understandable, and attractive to someone who is unfamiliar with the business. Writing a good business plan can’t guarantee success, but it can go a long way toward reducing the odds of failure.\" \n\nThe format of a business plan depends on its presentation context. It is common for businesses, especially start-ups, to have three or four formats for the same business plan.\n\nAn \"elevator pitch\" is a short summary of the plan's executive summary. This is often used as a teaser to awaken the interest of potential investors, customers, or strategic partners. It is called an elevator pitch as it is supposed to be content that can be explained to someone else quickly in an elevator. The elevator pitch should be between 30 and 60 seconds.\n\nA pitch deck is a slide show and oral presentation that is meant to trigger discussion and interest potential investors in reading the written presentation. The content of the presentation is usually limited to the executive summary and a few key graphs showing financial trends and key decision making benchmarks. If a new product is being proposed and time permits, a demonstration of the product may be included.\n\nA written presentation for external stakeholders is a detailed, well written, and pleasingly formatted plan targeted at external stakeholders.\n\nAn internal operational plan is a detailed plan describing planning details that are needed by management but may not be of interest to external stakeholders. Such plans have a somewhat higher degree of candor and informality than the version targeted at external stakeholders and others.\n\nTypical structure for a business plan for a start up venture \n\nTypical questions addressed by a business plan for a start up venture \n\nCost and revenue estimates are central to any business plan for deciding the viability of the planned venture. But costs are often underestimated and revenues overestimated resulting in later cost overruns, revenue shortfalls, and possibly non-viability. During the dot-com bubble 1997-2001 this was a problem for many technology start-ups. Reference class forecasting has been developed to reduce the risks of cost overruns and revenue shortfalls and thus generate more accurate business plans.\n\nAn externally targeted business plan should list all legal concerns and financial liabilities that might negatively affect investors. Depending on the amount of funds being raised and the audience to whom the plan is presented, failure to do this may have severe legal consequences.\n\nNon disclosure agreements (NDAs) with third parties, non-compete agreements, conflicts of interest, privacy concerns, and the protection of one's trade secrets may severely limit the audience to which one might show the business plan. Alternatively, they may require each party receiving the business plan to sign a contract accepting special clauses and conditions.\n\nThis situation is complicated by the fact that many venture capitalists will refuse to sign an NDA before looking at a business plan, lest it put them in the untenable position of looking at two independently developed look-alike business plans, both claiming originality. In such situations one may need to develop two versions of the business plan: a stripped down plan that can be used to develop a relationship and a detail plan that is only shown when investors have sufficient interest and trust to sign an NDA.\n\nTraditionally business plans have been highly confidential and quite limited in audience.\nThe business plan itself is generally regarded as secret.\n\nAn open business plan is a business plan with unlimited audience. The business plan is typically\nweb published and made available to all.\n\nIn the free software and open source business model, trade secrets, copyright and patents can no longer\nbe used as effective locking mechanisms to provide sustainable advantages to a particular business and therefore a secret business plan is less relevant in those models.\n\n\nFundraising is the primary purpose for many business plans, since they are related to the inherent probable success/failure of the company risk.\n\n\nThe business goals may be defined both for non-profit or for-profit organizations. For-profit business plans typically focus on financial goals, such as profit or creation of wealth. Non-profit, as well as government agency business plans tend to focus on the \"organizational mission\" which is the basis for their governmental status or their non-profit, tax-exempt status, respectively—although non-profits may also focus on optimizing revenue.\n\nThe primary difference between profit and non-profit organizations is that \"for-profit\" organizations look to maximize wealth versus non-profit organizations, which look to provide a greater good to society. In non-profit organizations, creative tensions may develop in the effort to balance mission with \"margin\" (or revenue).\n\nThe business plan is the subject of many satires. Satires are used both to express cynicism about business plans and as an educational tool to improve the quality of business plans. For example,\n"}

Choi, originally a Buddhist monk, then a convert to Roman Catholicism, was married six times. He was the mentor of the impeached South Korean president, Park Geun-hye (the daughter of former president Park Chung-hee), until his death in 1994. He allegedly used his relationship with Park to solicit bribes from government officials and businessmen. In late 2016, a scandal involving his daughter, Choi Soon-sil, broke out, with allegations that she too has exerted undue influence over President Park.\n\nChoi Tae-min set up a religious group called Yongsae-gyo (), or “Church of spirit world”, and declared himself Maitreya, or a “Future Buddha.” He befriended Park Geun-hye soon after her mother, Yuk Young-soo, was assassinated in 1974. According to a report by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency from the 1970s that was published by a South Korean news magazine in 2007, Choi initially approached Park Geun-hye by telling her that her mother had appeared to him in his dreams, asking him to help her daughter. \n\nChoi was an associate of former-president President Park Chung-hee until the latter's death by assassination in 1979. Kim Jae-gyu, the director of the KCIA who assassinated President Park Chung-hee, told a court that one of his motives was what he called the president’s failure to stop Choi Tae-min's corrupt activities and keep him away from his daughter.\n\nIn a newspaper interview in 2007, Park Geun-hye called Choi a patriot and said she was grateful for his counsel and comfort during “difficult times.” \n\nAlso in 2007, a diplomatic cable made public through WikiLeaks, the American Embassy in Seoul reported rumors that Mr. Choi, a 'Korean Rasputin', “had complete control over Park’s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.”\n\nHe used seven different names.\n"}
{"id": "2362332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2362332", "title": "Colour trade mark", "text": "Colour trade mark\n\nA colour trade mark (or color trademark, see spelling differences) is a non-conventional trade mark where at least one colour is used to perform the trade mark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services. \n\nIn recent times colours have been increasingly used as trade marks in the marketplace. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect colours as trademarks through registration, as a colour as such was not considered to be a distinctive 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass \"any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\" (article 15(1)).\n\nDespite the recognition which must be accorded to colour trade marks in most countries, the \"graphical representation\" of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue.\n\nThis category of trade marks is distinguished from conventional (word or logo) trade marks that feature a specific colour or combination of colours; the latter category of trade marks present different legal issues.\n\nRequirements are set out in the \"Trade Marks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure\" issued by IP Australia.\n\nIn the European Union, Article 4 of \"Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94\" of 20 December 1993 (\"signs of which a Community Trade Mark may consist\") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of \"any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\". In Libertel Groep v Benelux Merkenbureau (case C-104/01) dated May 6, 2003 the ECJ repeats the criteria from Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00) that graphical representation preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.\n\nThis definition generally encompasses colour marks, and therefore an applicant for a CTM or a national trademark in the EC may define their colour trademark using an international colour code such as RAL or Pantone. In most cases, a colour trademark will be registered only after an enhanced distinctiveness through use in the EC has been proved.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, trade marks consisting of colours or combinations of colours can be registered. However, an applicant's ability to register colour trade marks is limited by several considerations, in line with European Union jurisprudence. Thus, for example, while a trade mark described simply as a colour is registrable, a trade mark described as consisting \"predominantly\" of a particular colour is not. In a recent case, the High Court of Justice, Court of Chancery held that an application to register such a trade mark was permissible in \"Société des Produits Nestlé S.A. v. Cadbury UK Limited\" (2012), but on appeal the Court of Appeal reversed the decision in October 2014.\n\nIn the United States, the United States Court of Appeals ruled in 1985 that Owens Corning had the right to prevent competitors from using the colour pink in their insulation products, thus making Owens Corning the first company in the United States to trademark a colour. In 1995, the United States Supreme Court further acknowledged that a colour could be used as a trademark in the case of \"Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., Inc.\", 514 U.S. 159 (1995).\nThe trademark owner must show that the trademark colour has acquired substantial distinctiveness, and the colour indicates source of the goods to which it is applied.\n\nThe Lanham Act specifically states that \"[n]o trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it (e) Consists of a mark which (5) comprises any matter that, as a whole, is functional.\" .\nIf a colour is held functional for any product, then it is not registrable or protectable as a trademark. \nSeveral U.S. Courts have dealt with the matter, and colours have been held functional for various purposes.\nIn Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co., 90 USPQ2d 1425 (TTAB 2007), the purple colour was considered functional for coated abrasives, because “[i]n the field of coated abrasives, color serves a myriad of functions, including color coding, and the need to color code lends support for the basic finding that color, including purple, is functional in the field of coated abrasives having paper or cloth backing.” Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co., 90 USPQ2d 1425, 1447 (TTAB 2007).\nThe Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, in In re Ferris Corp., 59 USPQ2d 1587 (TTAB 2000), held that the colour pink for wound dressings was functional and not registrable, as its colour resembles human skin and was selected for this specific purpose.\nIn In re Orange Communications, Inc., 41 USPQ2d 1036 (TTAB 1996), the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board denied registration for the colours orange and yellow for public telephones and telephone booths, because it confers the goods better visibility under any lighting condition.\nAlso, the colour coral was held functional for earplugs, because it makes them easier to see in safety checks. In re Howard S. Leight & Associates Inc., 39 USPQ2d 1058 (TTAB 1996).\n\nIn addition to the functionality bar, the colour cannot have an aesthetically functional purpose in order to be registrable or protected. In Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull, for example, the United States Patents and Trademark Office's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board held that the black colour was not registrable for outboard motors:\n\"[A]lthough the color black is not functional in the sense that it makes these engines work better, or that it makes them easier or less expensive to manufacture, black is more desirable from the perspective of prospective purchasers because it is color compatible with a wider variety of boat colors and because objects colored black appear smaller than they do when they are painted other lighter or brighter colors. The evidence shows that people who buy outboard motors for boats like the colors of the motors to be harmonious with the colors of their vessels, and that they also find it desirable under some circumstances to reduce the perception of the size of the motors in proportion to the boats.\" British Seagull Ltd. v. Brunswick Corp., 28 USPQ 2d 1197, 1199 (1993).\nEven though there is no direct function for the colour black in this case, protection was denied under the argument that consumers prefer it for aesthetic purposes.\n\nA similar judgement was entered in Deere & Co. v. Farmhand. Deere & Co. tried to establish exclusive use of its John Deere green colour as a trademark, in order to enjoin Farmhand from applying it to its products. Although the John Deere green colour does not provide any specific function to the good to which it is applied, the United States District Court for S.D. Iowa \"found that farmers prefer to match their loaders to their tractor\". Deere & Co. v. Farmhand, Inc., 560 F. Supp. 85, 98 (U.S. Dist. Court S.D. Iowa, 1982). Therefore, if Deere & Co. were awarded exclusive use of the John Deere green, its competitors would be in disadvantage because of reasons unrelated to the functional quality or price of its products.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "230735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230735", "title": "Cost-of-production theory of value", "text": "Cost-of-production theory of value\n\nIn economics, the cost-of-production theory of value is the theory that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the factors of production (including labor, capital, or land) and taxation.\n\nThe theory makes the most sense under assumptions of constant returns to scale and the existence of just one non-produced factor of production. These are the assumptions of the so-called non-substitution theorem . Under these assumptions, the long-run price of a commodity is equal to the sum of the cost of the inputs into that commodity, including interest charges.\n\nHistorically, the best-known proponent of such theories is probably Adam Smith. Piero Sraffa, in his introduction to the first volume of the \"Collected Works of David Ricardo\", referred to Smith's \"adding-up\" theory. Smith contrasted natural prices with market price. Smith theorized that market prices would tend toward natural prices, where outputs would stand at what he characterized as the \"level of effectual demand\". At this level, Smith's natural prices of commodities are the sum of the natural rates of wages, profits, and rent that must be paid for inputs into production. (Smith is ambiguous about whether rent is price determining or price determined. The latter view is the consensus of later classical economists, with the Ricardo-Malthus-West theory of rent.)\n\nDavid Ricardo mixed this cost-of-production theory of prices with the labor theory of value, as that latter theory was understood by Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and others. This is the theory that prices tend toward proportionality to the socially necessary labor embodied in a commodity. Ricardo sets this theory at the start of the first chapter of his \"Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\". He also refutes the labor theory of value in later sections of that chapter. Taknaga advances a new interpretation that Ricardo had cost-of-production theory of value from the start and presents a more coherent interpretation based on texts of \"Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\". This alleged refutation leads to what later became known as the transformation problem. Karl Marx later takes up that theory in the first volume of \"Capital\", while indicating that he is quite aware that the theory is untrue at lower levels of abstraction. This has led to all sorts of arguments over what both David Ricardo and Karl Marx \"really meant\". Nevertheless, it seems undeniable that all the major classical economics and Marx explicitly rejected the labor theory of price().\n\nA somewhat different theory of cost-determined prices is provided by the \"neo-Ricardian School\" of Piero Sraffa and his followers. Shiozawa presented a modern interpretation of Ricardo's cost-of-production theory of value.\n\nThe Polish economist Michał Kalecki distinguished between sectors with \"cost-determined prices\" (such as manufacturing and services) and those with \"demand-determined prices\" (such as agriculture and raw material extraction).\n\nMarket price is a familiar economic concept: it is the price that a good or service is offered at, or will fetch, in the marketplace. It is of interest mainly in the study of microeconomics. Market value and market price are equal only under conditions of market efficiency, equilibrium, and rational expectations.\n\nIn economics, \"returns to scale\" and \"economies of scale\" are related terms that describe what happens as the scale of production increases. They are different, non-interchangeable concepts.\n\nThe labor theories of value are economic theories according to which the true values of commodities are related to the labor needed to produce them.\n\nThere are many accounts of labor value, with the common element that the \"value\" of an exchangeable good or service is, or ought to be, or tends to be, or can be considered as, equal or proportional to the amount of labor required to produce it (including the labor required to produce the raw materials and machinery used in production).\n\nDifferent labor theories of value prevailed among classical economists through the mid-19th century. This theory is especially associated with Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Since that time, it has been most often associated with Marxian economics, while among modern mainstream economists it is considered to be superseded by the marginal utility approach.\n\nTaxes and subsidies change the price of goods and services. A marginal tax on the sellers of a good will shift the supply curve to the left until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit tax; other things remaining equal, this will increase the price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and decrease the price received by the sellers. Marginal subsidies on production will shift the supply curve to the right until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit subsidy; other things remaining equal, this will decrease price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and increase the price received by the producers.\n"}

Since 1994, the company has been part of the Italian tire manufacturer Pirelli and is a 100% subsidiary of \"Deutsche Pirelli Reifen Holding GmbH\". The company has more than 80 stores in Germany operating under several brand names including \"Pneumobil, Driver,\" and \"Reifen-Wagner\". It employs approximately 500 people and had revenues of approx. €100 million in 2016. The company’s service offering includes tires, rims, high-quality car services and car accessories for almost all types of vehicles. The company is headquartered in Breuberg in the Odenwald region, on the factory premises of Pirelli Deutschland GmbH.\n\nThe company was established in 1979 and acquired by the Pirelli Group in 1994. After taking over, among others, the branches of Reifen Laupichler in the metropolitan area of Hamburg and Hanover the company, then named Pneumobil GmbH, acquired the tire retailers Junginger of Metzingen and Reifen Herl of Nürtingen with a total of 15 stores on 1 November 2003.\n\nEffective 1 January 2012, Christian F. Mühlhäuser took the helm of Pneumobil succeeding Hans-Ulrich Röske who had gone into early retirement after working more than 40 years for Pirelli Deutschland. Mühlhäuser joined Pirelli as a working student in 1993. Later, after studying engineering and obtaining an MBA degree at US universities, he assumed management functions in the areas of logistics and planning, quality and technology, and in Pirelli‘s headquarters in Milan. In 2009, he took the helm of the Pirelli motorcycle tire factory in Breuberg. \n\nPneumobil went on to acquire more companies such as Reifen Blank of Düren on 1 August 2013 and PneuCenter RRT GmbH of Sindelfingen on 1 September 2013. At the same time, Pneumobil obtained possession of Reifen-Wagner R.W. Auto-Technik, a Landshut-based company offering specialized tire retail and car services. The 100 employees of Reifen-Wagner were kept on the payroll and the service network with a total of ten workshops exclusively based in the state of Bavaria was also taken over.\n\nOn 13 September 2013, Pneumobil opened its first \"Driver Center\" in Frankfurt. A combination of show room, design lounge, consultation room, sales and service area, these flagship stores are designed to turn “purchasing tires and car services into an experience.” The layout of the store’s workshop area is inspired by the pit lanes in motor sports. Effective 1 October 2013, Pneumobil acquired Reifen-Wagner I.S. Auto-Service GmbH & Co. KG, also based in Landshut, with its 15 stores and 140 employees. September 2014 saw the opening of more Driver Centers in Bonn, Aachen, and Trier.\n\nOn 7 April 2017, Pneumobil GmbH changed its name to Pneumobil Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH by registering the new name in trade register B of the local court of Darmstadt. Shortly afterwards, on 1 July 2017, the Cologne-based tire retailer Reifen Schäfer e.K. was taken over by Pneumobil. \n\nAfter a redesign of six Pneumobil stores in the area of Frankfurt and two Reifen-Wagner stores in Munich, there are 21 Driver Centers (as of October 2017) which are all 100% property of Pneumobil Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH. In addition, there are other Driver Centers in the network of Pneumobil’s sister company \"Driver Handelssysteme GmbH\" which is also a subsidiary of \"Deutsche Pirelli Reifen Holding GmbH\". \n\nAt the end of September 2017, the former Reifen Wagner branch in Hanauerstr. 42, Munich was reopened as the Driver Center Munich. The first European P-Zero World of the Pirelli Group was also formed within this Driver Center. Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH have also been operating it since it opened. \n\nOn 29 December 2017, \"Pneumobil Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH\" changed it name to \"Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH\" with legal effect. Christian F. Mühlhäuser was the Managing Director until 22 January 2018. On 1 July 2018, it was announced that he would become the Managing Director of the world’s leading tire manufacturer, Bridgestone. On 16 March 2018, Thorsten Schäfer became the new Managing Director of Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH. Since 1 August 2018, there have been two new locations in the Driver network: Haßloch and Landau in the Palatinate region. \n\nThis brings the total number of branches in Germany to 78.\n\nThe approx. 80 stores of Pneumobil Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH operate under three different brand names. The \"Pneumobil\" brand is predominantly used in the Rhine/Main/Ruhr metropolitan areas as well as Stuttgart, Hamburg, and Hanover. In Bavaria, the company mainly relies on the \"Reifen-Wagner\" brand with its almost century-long tradition. Since the opening of the Frankfurt Driver Center in September 2013 new outlets also carry the \"Driver\"™ logo.\n\nThe company‘s product portfolio includes tires of renowned manufacturers such as Pirelli, Continental, Dunlop, Goodyear, Kumho, Michelin and several others, rims, high-quality car services and car accessories for almost all types of vehicles. The tire portfolio on offer ranges from special tires for container stackers in the Port of Hamburg to wheelbarrow tires and from Ultra High Performance tires to environmentally-friendly Eco tires. Besides services for private customers, the company also offers services for vehicle fleets and commercial vehicles used by businesses.\n\nPneumobil has won several awards for the quality of its service. In 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2016 it ranked No. 1 in the “Tire Retailer Service Study” conducted by the German Institute for Service Quality (DISQ) on behalf of the German n-tv television network. The study sampled 14 tire retailers and tire retail chains with a minimum of 25 outlets across Germany with respect to both their consulting competency and product presentation.\n\nIn 2016, Pneumobil won the study “Tire and Car Service Atlas” conducted by the Cologne-based Service Value GmbH for the third time in a row. The results of the study are based on 1,300 customer ratings for a set of 30 general and industry-specific service and performance criteria.\n\nIn February 2017, the DISQ held an awards ceremony at the Berlin representation of Bertelsmann during which it presented Pneumobil with the 2017 German Service Award in the category “Travel and Mobility - On Site Consultancy” in recognition of its customer friendliness. The series of awards also continues under the new name of Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH. In September 2018, first place was once again taken by the “Tire Retailer Service Study” of the German Institute for Service Quality (DISQ). In October 2018, the company once again achieved overall victory in the Tire and Car Service Atlas 2018.\n\nDriver offers vocational training for retailers and car technicians and provides a cooperative degree program for high-school students wishing to become automobile dealers. Driver’s commitment to the environment is based on streamlined logistics processes, efficient use of materials and advanced energy concepts. In addition, the company has commissioned its disposal and recycling processes to selected and certified specialist companies.\n\n"}

The story of their training may be found at \"Solving the Naval Radar Crisis\" by Raymond C Watson, Jr. Trafford Publishing 2007 . \nThe rating insignia adopted was that of the established Radioman (abbreviated as RM) rating, and remained until October 1945, when the rating name was changed to Electronic Technician's Mate (abbreviated as ETM). In 1948, the Navy changed the name of the rating to Electronics Technician, and a new rating insignia was created.\n\nIn 1971 the Radarman (abbreviated as RD) rating was disestablished. Former Radarmen, depending on their training, were placed in to the either the established Electronic Technician (ET) rating or either of the newly established Operations Specialist (abbreviated as OS) or Electronic Warfare Technician (abbreviated as EW) ratings.\n\nOn October 1, 1998 the Data Systems Technicians (abbreviated as DS) rating was disestablished. Former Data Systems Technicians were, depending on their training, placed in to either the Electronics Technician or Fire Controlman (abbreviated as FC) rating.\n\nOn November 3, 2015 a mostly administrative change was made to the general ET rating. Electronics Technicians who volunteered for submarine duty where redesignated as either Electronics Technician, Submarine, Communications (abbreviated as ETR) or Electronics Technician, Submarine, Navigation (abbreviated as ETV). Nuclear Power trained Electronics Technicians were redesignated as Electronics Technicians, Nuclear Power (abbreviated as ETN). Electronics Technicians serving in the service rating Electronics Technician (ET) remained designed as Electronics Technician (ET). Electronics Technician (ET) is sometimes abbreviated as ETSW when it is necessary to distinguish ET from ETR, ETV, and ETN. All three new ratings as well as the original Electronics Technician rating use the same Electronics Technician rating insignia.\n\nThe reason for the change is because even those these four service ratings (ET, ETR, ETV, and ETN) fall under the same general rating (ET), share a common history, have similar names and share the same rating insignia the enlistment requirements, initial 'A' school training, specialized 'C' school training, job assignments (billets), specific qualification, and community managers are unique to each of the four service rating. This prevents someone trained in any of the four service rating from easily transferring to another of the four service rating without first going through significant retraining and qualification that would be required by anyone transferring from any of the other general rating in the Navy.\n\nOn September 29, 2016 the Navy moved away from traditional ratings to an alphanumeric system of Navy Occupational Specialty (NOS) codes. The ET-related NOS codes were: for ET, B420; for ETR, C126; for ETV, C121; for ETN, D110, D111, or D112. \n\nOn December 21, 2016 however, after months of widespread complaints, Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson released a message announcing a restoration of all U.S. Navy Ratings.\n\nETs are responsible for electronic equipment used to send and receive messages, computer information systems, long range radar, and calibration of test equipment. They maintain, repair, calibrate, tune, and adjust electronic equipment used for communications, detection and tracking, recognition and identification, navigation.\n\nJobs performed by ETs are performed throughout the Navy's fleet of surface ships including aircraft carriers and Aegis cruisers and destroyers, and at communication activities and repair activities ashore.\n\n\nEntry rates ET3-ET2 (E4-E5) specialize as electronics communications technician, electronics data systems technician, or electronics radar systems technician. ET1-ETC (E6-E7) are electronics systems managers.\n\nMaintain shore-based, ship-based, portable communications equipment, and portable Mechatronic equipment, including all associated cabling, computer, multiplexing, motor, switching, cryptographic, recording, cooling water and dry air systems; analyze equipment operation and align, troubleshoot using digital multimeters, oscilloscopes, thermal couples and repair equipment to the lowest replaceable unit; execute casualty control procedures, restoring operability for all assigned electronic equipment, recognizing mission criticality and redundancies within systems; perform administrative functions that include the updating of casualty reporting messages, technical manuals, equipment maintenance records, and managing test equipment calibration requirements;Motors and motor controls for satellite antennas, radar cooling motor control pumps mechanical knowledge of electrical motor characteristics brush and brushless, complete fiber optic and basic soldering repair, electrical safety checks, and test equipment calibration; and supervise personnel who complete maintenance, conduct tool, MAM, and test equipment inventories, logistics support, and operational verification testing of new systems or equipment.\n\nMaintain data link, inertial navigation, tactical network, message routing, digital production/projection, calibration, fiber optics, micro-miniature module test and repair, computer-based, and peripheral computer systems; analyze equipment operation, establish computer and network configurations, and troubleshoot and repair computer-based equipment to the lowest replaceable unit; execute casualty control procedures, restoring operability for all assigned electronic equipment, recognizing mission criticality and redundancies within systems; perform administrative functions that include the updating of casualty reporting messages, technical manuals, equipment maintenance records, and managing test equipment calibration requirements; complete fiber optic and basic soldering repair, electrical safety checks, and test equipment calibration; and supervise personnel who complete maintenance, conduct tool, MAM, and test equipment inventories, logistics support, and operational verification testing of new systems or equipment.\n\nMaintain surface search, air search, and weather radar systems, radar video switchboards, synchros, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) equipment, tactical air navigation equipment, including all associated cabling, cooling water and dry air systems; analyze equipment operation and align, troubleshoot, and repair equipment to the lowest replaceable unit; execute casualty control procedures, restoring operability for all assigned electronic equipment, recognizing mission criticality and redundancies within systems; perform administrative functions that include managing test equipment calibration requirements and the updating of casualty reporting messages, technical manuals, and equipment maintenance records; complete, fiber optic and basic soldering repair, electrical safety checks, and test equipment calibration; and supervise personnel who complete maintenance, conduct tool, MAM, and test equipment inventories, logistics support, and operational verification testing of new systems or equipment.\n\nEnlistees are taught the fundamentals of the ET rating through the following formal Navy schooling.\n\nAfter \"A\" school, ETs continue on to advanced \"C\" schools. School lengths and content vary, but many colleges and universities offer college credits for these Navy courses.\n\nThe Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) system supports the enlisted rating structure in identifying personnel and billets in manpower authorizations. NEC codes identify a non-rating wide skill, knowledge, aptitude, or qualification that must be documented to identify both people and billets for management purposes. The most current information regarding NECs can be found in the Navy NEOCS Manual.\n\nAfter 'A' school and between duty assignments ETs will attend advanced 'C' school training. These 'C' school give the ET advanced training in the specific systems that will be required to maintain and repair at their next duty assignment.\n\nThere are 62 ET-related NECs.\n\nThe follow NEC list is incomplete:\n\nThe Navy's Submarine Electronics / Computer Field (SECF) offers extensive training in the operation and maintenance of \"Today's High Technology\" advanced electronics equipment, digital systems and computers used in submarine combat control, sonar, navigation and communications systems. An individual selecting SECF will receive training in electricity, electronics, computers, digital systems, fiber optics and electronics repair.\nThe standards for selection for enlistment in the Navy's Submarine Electronics/ Computer Field are high. Personnel interested in applying for the Submarine Electronics/ Computer Field should be seriously interested in pursuing the challenge this highly technical field offers. They must be mature, ready to take on significant responsibility and willing to apply themselves.\n\nVolunteers for the Submarine Electronics/Computer Field will specialize in one of four Submarine Ratings (Electronics Technician – Communications (ETR), Electronics Technician - Navigation (ETV), Fire Control Technician (FT), and Sonar Technician Submarines (STS) working in one of four areas: combat systems, communications, navigation or underwater acoustic technologies. All four ratings/specialty areas are heavily involved with computer and electronics systems. The communications specialty (ETR) is responsible for all operational and administrative aspects of the submarine's radio communication equipment, systems and programs. The navigation specialty (ETV) is responsible for all operational and administrative aspects of the submarine's navigation and radar equipment, systems and programs.\n\n\nSubmarine ETs (navigation and communications) must complete Basic Enlisted Submarine School, ATT, Tactical Computer and Network Operator, and \"A\" School at Naval Submarine School in Groton, CT.\n\nNuclear-trained ETNs perform duties in nuclear propulsion plants primarily in operating, maintaining, and repairing reactor instrumentation and control systems. ETNs may be assigned as an operator to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, as an instructor at a Navy nuclear power training command, or as a technician at a shipyard or other nuclear support facility. Additionally ETNs may volunteer for nuclear submarine service. ETNs are the only rating in the Navy that can qualify as a reactor operator of a naval nuclear propulsion plant.\n\nETNs complete several different phases of training in order to be able to operate a naval nuclear propulsion plant. In order to be selected for nuclear training prospective Navy recruits must have a high enough cutscore on the Armed Service Vocational Battery (ASVAB) that score being greater than 88 and the Navy Advanced Placement Test (NAPT) that score being greater than 55%. Prospective nuclear recruits are then sent to Navy boot camp where prospective nuclear trainees are selected in a 50-30-20 ratio to be trained as nuclear machinist's mates, nuclear electrician's mate, or nuclear electronics technicians. Those who are selected to be nuclear electronics technicians then enter the Navy Nuclear Pipeline to train to become an ETN.\n\nIn the first stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, prospective ETNs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Field 'A' School (NFAS) at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC) in Goose Creek, SC. The curriculum at NFAS includes a mathematics refresher course, basic electronics theory, analog electronics theory (EFUNDS), digital electronics theory, and instrumentation and control equipment (I&CE) theory and maintenance. The curriculum is presented in a high paced manner that ramps up over the term at NFAS in order to prepare students for the difficulties of Nuclear Power School. The curriculum is very similar to that which is presented to nuclear electricians except that nuclear electricians train in electrical motor and generator theory and maintenance instead of I&CE theory and maintenance. Due to the specialized training given at NFAS, ETNs who have trained there instead of another ET 'A' school are not qualified to be assigned to billets designed for non-nuclear ETs. Personnel who are disqualified from Navy nuclear work ('de-nuked') or who fail to qualify for Navy nuclear work later in the pipeline are reclassified and retrained into another rating in order to remain in the Navy. ETN is not eligible for direct conversion to ET. This means that for an ETN to become and ET they must attend the ET 'A' school.\n\nIn the second stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETNs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Power School at the NNPTC. The curriculum for ETNs at the Nuclear Power School includes a higher level mathematics (Calculus) refresher course, introduction to nuclear propulsion systems, Navy nuclear mechanical, electrical, and electronics system design, reactor theory, health physics, basic materials science, and chemistry as it applies to nuclear power plants. The curriculum is similar for MMNs, EMNs, and ETNs, except that each rating focuses more on their particular nuclear system design (for nuclear ETNs this means that they have additional training in nuclear electronics design).\n\nIn the third and final stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETNs are trained for six months at one of four Navy nuclear prototype training units (NPTUs). Two NPTUs are moored training ships (MTS) using S5W reactors located at the Naval Weapons Station in Charleston, SC., and two additional NPTUs are land-based prototype units using a S7G reactor and a S8G reactor located in Saratoga Springs, NY. The curriculum for ETNs at an NPTU includes detailed health physics training, design, operation, and maintenance of electronics systems for the NPTU, nuclear watchstanding procedures, and nuclear casualty procedures. Unlike the first two stages of the Navy Nuclear Pipeline where the curriculum is presented in a typical classroom format, training at an NPTU is self-motivated training where students are required to research different aspects of a nuclear propulsion plant design, operation, or theory and demonstrate this knowledge in an oral interview with a qualified nuclear instructor. Additionally, ETNs must perform graded watches under the instruction of a qualified nuclear instructor where they operate a particular piece of nuclear equipment or respond to a casualty. The culmination of training for an ETN is an oral board where an ETN must demonstrate the knowledge of all procedures, equipment, theory expected for a nuclear reactor operator. Completion of NPTU qualifies an ETN to stand watch on the NPTU or to train to operate nuclear propulsion plants on a nuclear aircraft carrier or submarine. Additionally, it gives the individual the ETN Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC), and the individual is then said to be \"nuclear qualified.\"\n\nUpon completion of the Naval Nuclear Pipeline, most nuclear qualified ETNs are sent to nuclear aircraft carriers or nuclear submarines. On a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, ETNs are sent to a nuclear training division where they train to qualify to operate the nuclear reactors of the ship in a similar way to NPTU for about six months prior to being sent to a reactor control division. In contrast, on a submarine ETNs are directly assigned to the Reactor Controls division and are directed to qualify different watches incrementally. Due to the smaller number of personnel on a nuclear submarine, ETNs must also cross qualify on several nuclear electrician watches. Since ETNs are required to stand watches, perform maintenance, and train and qualify on additional submarine systems, it is not uncommon for it to take over 12 months for an ETN to become fully qualified as a reactor operator, shutdown reactor operator, and all intermediate watches. Upon subsequent transfer to an NPTU or another nuclear ship, operators are required to re-qualify the same watches in only about 6 months.\n\nEven upon completion of being fully qualified on all ETN watches (\"qualified in rate\"), additional proficiency and casualty training is required for all ETNs. On a ship this generally includes general Engineering or Reactor Department training, Reactor Controls division training, periodic exams and interviews, monitored maintenance and operations, periodic watch re-qualifications, and monitored tactical or casualty drills.\n\nUsually after an ETN is \"fully qualified\" the individual is sent to an \"in-rate\" technical school ETMS where the technician studies electronic troubleshooting and repair on shipboard equipment. Completion of this school allows the technician to be designated with the NEC 3373.\n\nSenior ETNs (typically those who hold the rank of petty officer first class (E-6) or higher) are expected to qualify for senior supervisory watches. Self-motivated training for this includes the detailed operations of all nuclear systems on a ship (not just the ETN specific parts) focusing on the big picture view of nuclear operations and casualty response. The training time required to qualify for senior supervisory watches depends on the individual.\n\n"}

In 1899 he started his own company, trading in iron, steel and other construction metals. He later expanded the company with the selling of agricultural machinery. In 1910 he abandoned the company he had started in order to take the head job of P. Schreiner sen. & Co, a company ran by his father beforehand.\n\nAnker became a board member of Kværner Brug in 1910, and advanced to chairman in 1914. He also chaired Myrens Verksted, Moss Værft & Dokk, Landbruk Maskin (in both Oslo and Florø), A/S Staal & Jern and Jernmetal. He was a main shareholder in Landbruk Maskin, Staal & Jern and Jernmetal, and a board member of Elektrisk Bureau, supervisory council member of Nationaltheatret and Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse, and also chaired two philanthropical institutions run by his family. Heavily engaged in politics, Anker was a member of the financial committee of the Conservative Party's central board from 1909 to 1916. From 1925 he chaired the employers' association Jerngrossistenes Forening.\n\nIn February 1946 Anker was arrested together with the office manager in P. Schreiner sen. & Co, on suspicion of \"economic treason\", as a part of the legal purge in Norway after World War II. Specific accounts were his involvement in the collection of 8000 tons of tin for Wehrmacht, stockpiling of 12,100 tons of iron for the Kriegsmarinewerft in Horten, stockpiling of iron at the grounds of his companies in Florø, Harstad and Trondheim, as well as utilization of forced labour in doing so, delivery of spikes to a \"Luftgau-Kommando\", building of armed whaling vessels for the \"Kriegsmarine\", \"statements during the war\" and collection of business orders issued by Germany while the Second World War was still ongoing in Norway.\n\nAnker pleaded not guilty, and referred to his office manager who handled the daily affairs. He was found not guilty of the spike deliverance. In spite of this, he was found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to one year of prison and a fine. , This represents about in currency (about ). In 1950 Anker was sued, as chairman of Moss Værft & Dokk, by Øivind Lorentzen's company Sobral. Sobral claimed that Moss Værft & Dokk negliged their contract agreement regarding the construction of two vessels during the war. First, claimed Sobral, Moss Værft & Dokk had instead used their capacity on arming whaling vessels. The two vessels had been delayed, and when they were completed, they had been taken over by \"Kriegsmarine\" as minesweepers. The court case lasted several years, reaching the Court of Appeal in 1954.\n\nAnker was decorated as a Commander, Second Class of the Belgian Royal Order of the Lion before the Second World War. He died in April 1954 and was buried at Vestre gravlund.\n"}

{"id": "11098797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11098797", "title": "Khyber Pass copy", "text": "Khyber Pass copy\n\nA Khyber Pass copy is a firearm manufactured by cottage gunsmiths in the Khyber Pass region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nThe area has long had a reputation for producing unlicensed, homemade copies of firearms using whatever materials are available – more often than not, railway rails, scrap motor vehicles, and other scrap metal. The quality of such firearms varies widely, ranging from as good as a factory-produced example to dangerously poor.\n\nThe most commonly encountered Khyber Pass copies are of British military firearms, notably Martini–Henry, Martini–Enfield, and Lee–Enfield rifles, although AK-47 rifles, Webley Revolvers, Tokarev TT-33s, Colt M1911s and Browning Hi-Powers have also been encountered. In the United States, a Kalashnikov-style rifle composed of a mix of parts from various style AK rifles is sometimes referred to as a Khyber Pass AK because, like Khyber guns, they are unlike any rifle produced by a factory or issued by a regular military force. The typical example of a \"Khyber Pass AK\" is a stamped receiver AKM chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge, fitted with the triangular folding stock common to Russian AKS-74 rifles.\n\nThe Khyber Pass gunsmiths first acquired examples of the various British service arms during nineteenth-century British military expeditions in the North-West Frontier, which they used to make copies. During World War II, some locally organised irregular forces were issued Khyber Pass-made rifles – partly for financial reasons and partly because there was concern the troops would steal their rifles and desert if issued higher-quality British or Indian manufactured rifles.\n\nKhyber Pass rifles are usually copied exactly from a \"master\" rifle (which may itself be a Khyber Pass copy), markings and all. It's not uncommon to see Khyber Pass rifles with numerous errors and particular identifying factors, notably:\n\nAfghanistan was a point of conflict between the British Empire and Imperial Russia throughout the 19th century, from which it is reasonable to assume that tools and expertise relevant to both cultures were accumulated by native gunsmiths. Rather than a translation error, a reversed \"N\" or \"L\" in ENFIELD may be the Cyrillic \"И\" and \"Г\" characters, with the gunsmith using whatever letter punches similar to original letters, but ensuring it can be identified as duplicate to avoid legal issues of using original trademark names.\n\nNot only are there counterfeit weapons, but there is counterfeit ammunition as well. Typically they are based on low-powered modern cartridges. .30 bore cartridges are compatible with 7.63×25mm Mauser or 7.62×25mm Tokarev. .32 bore cartridges are compatible with .32 Auto Colt Pistol / 7.65mm Browning (7.65×17mmSR). 12 bore cartridges are 12 gauge (18.5x70mmR) shotgun shells.\n\n44 bore cartridges are compatible with the 7.92×33mm Kurz round for the World War Two era StG 44. Pakistan has a ban on rifles designed to fire military cartridges; the use of the 44 bore cartridge was a loophole in the law until specifically banned in 2012. It was used in AKM copies chambered or modified for it. It was a popular cartridge because it was easy to modify AKMs to fire it but still fed from standard AK magazines. Saquib brand makes 44 bore ammunition.\n\nThe ammunition used in the Khyber Pass region is often underloaded, being made from a variety of powders or even old film (which contains nitrocellulose, a key component of smokeless powder); Khyber Pass Copy rifles cannot be expected to withstand the pressures generated by modern commercial ammunition. A few collectors have made extremely mild handloaded cartridges for their Khyber Pass rifles and fired them, at substantial personal risk.\n\nThe packaging and headstamps are often forged versions of quality foreign brands like GECO (\"Gustav Genschow & Co.\"), Golden Tiger (Vympel IIRC), China Sport (NORINCO), MEN (\"Metallwerk Elisenhütte Nassau\"), and PPU (Prvi Partizan Užice). Local counterfeits have colorful brand-name packaging like Buffalo, Diamond, Double Dragon, Double Star, Federal SKF, Goodluck, Gorilla, and Tiger SBR.\n\nThe Khyber Arms Company, a local ammunition manufacturer, makes the Expert or X-Pert brand. It uses counterfeit Winchester ammunition packaging with cartridges stamped with fake NORINCO \"State Factory 311\" headstamps.\n\nNew casings and bullet jackets are usually copper-washed steel, like Chinese ammunition. The casings are sometimes recycled from scrounged US or NATO military brass casings. 5.56mm NATO cases are cut-down and reshaped to make .30 bore rounds. 9×19mm Parabellum cases are cut down to make reloaded .380 ACP / 9×17mm Short or 9×18mm Makarov rounds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53470829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53470829", "title": "Law of carriage of goods by sea", "text": "Law of carriage of goods by sea\n\nThe law of carriage of goods by sea is a body of law that governs the rights and duties of shippers, carriers and consignees of marine cargo. \n\nPrimarily concerned with cargo claims, this body of law is an aspect of international commercial law and maritime law.\n\nConsignees (or indeed any lawful holder of the bill of lading) who wishes to make a cargo claim because their goods are substandard or have been lost or damaged at sea, typically have four options: \nA claim having been paid, the assured's rights of claim will be subrogated to the insurer, who may consider proceeding against a party who has caused the damage.\n\nA shipowner may sue a time-charterer or voyage-charterer in the event of breach of contract. For instance, if the charterer exceeds laytime, demurrage will have to be paid; and if the charterer cannot comply with a Notice of Readiness (NOR), the shipowner may repudiate (cancel) the contract of carriage and claim damages for any loss.\n\nIn most contracts of carriage the carrier has greater bargaining power than the shipper, and in the 19th century English judges developed rules to protect the weaker parties. Beginning with the Hague Rules, the various conventions set out to codify and develop such common law principles by providing an international set of basic standards to be met by the carrier, with a view to establishing a universal framework of legal rights and duties. In practice, however, the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on a wide array of exemptions from liability Also, whereas up until about 1885, the carrier's duties were deemed to be strict, by 1905 the duty became one of \"reasonable care\" or \"due diligence\" only.\n\nThe Hague Rules of 1924 effectively codified, albeit in a diluted form, the English common law rules to protect the cargo owner against exploitation by the carrier. Nearly 50 years later, the Hague-Visby \"update\" made few changes, so that the newer Rules still applied only to \"tackle to tackle\" carriage (i.e. carriage by sea) and the container revolution of the 1950s was virtually ignored. The Hague-Visby Rules both excluded cabotage carriage, and declared that deck cargo and live animals were not to be considered as \"goods\" (although the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 provided that cabotage, deck cargo and live animals are to be covered in English contracts). \n\nThe enormous list of exemptions to liability in Article IV made the Rules seem biased in favour of the carrier. As a result, The United Nations produced its own Hamburg Rules which were both more modern and fairer to cargo-owners; but while these have been enthusiastically adopted by developing nations, the wealthier ship-owning nations have stuck to Hague-Visby. In 2008 the final text of the Rotterdam Rules was agreed at UNCITRAL. These Rules are very extensive, with over 90 Articles against 11 in Hague-Visby. Although the Rotterdam Rules are up-to-date and address multimodal carriage, they have, nine years later, yet to be in force. It now seems doubtful that the Rotterdam Rules will ever be adopted, but there is a slim possibility that a cut-down version of the Rules (\"Rotterdam Lite\") might find favour.\n\nChina has effectively adopted the Hague Rules.

On the air, he served as host and managing editor of the network's business program, \"Moneyline\", which premiered in 1980. The show was renamed \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in 2003. Dobbs resigned from CNN for a short period of time in 1999 but rejoined the network in 2001. He resigned once again in November 2009. In 2011, he joined the Fox Business Network, resuming and anchoring his show, \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\". He is the former host of a syndicated U.S. Radio Network program, \"Lou Dobbs Radio\". Dobbs has authored several books since 2001.\n\nDobbs describes himself politically as an \"independent populist\". He is known for his pro-Trump coverage, anti-immigration views, promotion of Barack Obama birther conspiracy theories, and opposition to NAFTA.\n\nBorn in Childress County, Texas, Dobbs is the son of Frank Dobbs, a co-owner of a propane business, and Lydia Mae (née Hensley), a bookkeeper. When Dobbs was 12, his father's propane business failed and the family moved to Rupert, Idaho. He attended Minico High School in Minidoka County, where he played tackle on the football team, played the sousaphone in the band, and served as student body president. Although accepted at the University of Idaho and Idaho State University, he was persuaded by the staff at Minico High to apply to Harvard University, where he was accepted and later graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1967. While at Harvard, Dobbs lived in Quincy House and was elected to the Owl Club.\n\nAfter graduating, Dobbs worked for federal anti-poverty programs in Boston and Washington, D.C., then returned to Idaho. He briefly attended law school at the UI College of Law in Moscow, Idaho and then worked as a cash-management specialist for Union Bank of California in Los Angeles. He married his high school sweetheart in 1969, and in 1970 their first son was born. Dobbs moved to Yuma, Arizona, and got a job as a police and fire reporter for KBLU. By the mid-1970s he was a television anchor and reporter in Phoenix, and he later joined Seattle's KING-TV. In 1979, he was contacted by a recruiter for Ted Turner, who was in the process of forming CNN. Dobbs divorced his first wife in 1981 and is now married to Debi Lee Segura, a former CNN sports anchor. The couple raised four children together. Dobbs resides on a horse farm in Wantage Township, New Jersey.\n\nDobbs joined CNN when it launched in 1980, serving as its chief economics correspondent and as host of the business news program \"Moneyline\" on CNN. Dobbs also served as a corporate executive for CNN, as its executive vice president and as a member of CNN's executive committee. He founded CNN fn (CNN financial news), serving as its president and anchoring the program \"Business Unusual\", which examined business creativity and leadership.\n\nDobbs repeatedly clashed with Rick Kaplan, who became president of CNN in 1997. Dobbs said Kaplan, noted friend of then president Bill Clinton, was \"clearly partisan\" and \"was pushing Clinton stories\", while Kaplan said Dobbs was \"a very difficult person to work with\".\n\nOn April 20, 1999, CNN was covering Clinton's speech in Littleton, Colorado, following the Columbine High School massacre. Dobbs ordered the producer to cut away from the speech and return to broadcast \"Moneyline\". Dobbs was countermanded by Kaplan, who ordered CNN to return to the speech. Kaplan later said, \"Tell me what journalistic reason there was not to cover the president at Columbine soon after the shootings? Everyone else was doing it\". Dobbs announced on the air that \"CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton\". A few days later, Dobbs announced that he was leaving the network to start Space.com, a website devoted to astronautical news. Dobbs was subsequently replaced as host of \"Moneyline\" by Willow Bay and Stuart Varney.\n\nKaplan left CNN in August 2000, and Dobbs returned the following year, at the behest of his friend and CNN founder Ted Turner, becoming host and managing editor of the new and initially more general news program \"Lou Dobbs Reporting\", which later became \"CNN News Sunday Morning\". He also regained the helm of the newly renamed \"Lou Dobbs Moneyline\" (which became \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" in June 2003).\n\nOn the November 11, 2009 edition of his nightly broadcast \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\", Dobbs announced his immediate departure from CNN, ending a nearly thirty-year career at the network, citing plans to \"pursue new opportunities\". CNN President Jon Klein said that Dobbs' departure was not a result of organized opposition to Dobbs' viewpoints.\n\nIn July 2009, controversy around Dobbs began when he was the only mainstream news anchor to give airtime to the birther conspiracy theory. Several liberal advocacy groups, including Media Matters, and the Southern Poverty Law Center criticized Dobbs for his reporting. The controversy eventually caused CNN President Jon Klein to rein Dobbs in via an internal memorandum. In September, advocates challenged Dobbs for appearing at a conference organized by the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform. Multiple campaigns were launched, including \"Drop Dobbs\" (NDN, Media Matters), and \"Basta Dobbs\" (Presente.org).\n\nThe campaigns also attacked CNN for alleged hypocrisy towards Latinos, citing CNN's \"Latino in America\" special as incompatible with their continued support of Dobbs. The campaigns generated considerable anti-Dobbs press, and are credited by some as pushing Dobbs out.\n\nDobbs was reportedly paid $8 million in severance pay when he left CNN prior to his contract being due for renewal.\n\nAfter Dobbs left CNN in 2009, he gave an interview where he did not rule out the possibility of running for President of the United States in 2012, saying the final decision would rest with his wife. Former Senator Dean Barkley said he thought Dobbs should run for president.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, Dobbs hosted \"Lou Dobbs Radio\" on United Stations Radio Networks. The three-hour daily show had affiliates in several major markets, including its flagship station (WOR) in New York City, Washington D.C. (WHFS), Miami (WZAB-AM) and the San Francisco Bay Area (KDOW), as well as stations such as WGNY-AM in Newburgh, New York. The show was guest-centered and featured political discussion and listener calls. It aired from 2 to 5 p.m. Eastern, directly competing with \"The Sean Hannity Show\", \"The Tom Sullivan Show\" and \"The Dave Ramsey Show\". Dobbs also hosts the financially themed \"Lou Dobbs Minute\" on the same network.\n\nIn June 2008, Dobbs reached an agreement with Business Talk Radio Network to carry a rebroadcast of the show from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern, displacing Bruce Williams. Dobbs' show was also carried live on CRN Digital Talk Radio Networks.\n\nDobbs was among the hosts who tried out for the position vacated by the cancellation of \"Imus in the Morning\" on WFAN, a position that was eventually filled by \"Boomer and Carton in the Morning\". Dobbs mentioned on his radio show that he is currently seeking a position in the US Department of Treasury during the economic crisis. He stated that he believed he could \"do more good than the clowns currently in position.\"\n\nDobbs also is a regular columnist in \"Money\" magazine, \"U.S. News & World Report\", and the \"New York Daily News\".\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Fox Business Network announced that Dobbs would host a show on the channel. The network announced on March 3, 2011 the start date, show title, and time slot of Dobbs' new show. Titled \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" the program debuted on March 14, 2011, airing at 7 PM Eastern. That is the same title and time slot that Dobbs' old CNN show had.\n\nSince 2009, Dobbs has made regular appearances to discuss issues on other news network programs including CNBC's \"The Kudlow Report\" and Fox News Channel's \"The O'Reilly Factor\". On October 5, 2010, Dobbs made a guest appearance on an episode of \"The Good Wife\", entitled \"Double Jeopardy\", in which he plays himself as a client in search of a new law firm to represent his legal interests.\n\nDobbs was a lifelong Republican. However, he later registered as an Independent following a break with the Bush Administration. Dobbs is known for his anti-immigration views, warnings about Islamist terror, and his opposition to free trade. He is known for his pro-Trump coverage. According to \"The Daily Beast\", by 2018, Dobbs had turned into a \"full-on conservative nationalist-populist and culture warrior.\"\n\nDobbs promoted the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. His willingness to raise the \"birther\" issue repeatedly even though CNN itself considered it a \"discredited rumor\", led the \"Washington Post\"'s TV critic to remark that this \"explains their upcoming documentary: 'The World: Flat. We Report – You Decide.'\" The issue had come up in 2008 during the Presidential campaign, and had largely disappeared from the media spotlight until Dobbs picked up the issue again. His statements in support of these conspiracy theories were dubbed \"racist\" and \"defamatory\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The controversy led to Media Matters airing ads critical of Dobbs and of CNN, and to Jon Stewart mocking Dobbs on the satirical Comedy Central television series \"The Daily Show\". \"The New York Times\" said that Dobbs had \"become a publicity nightmare for CNN, embarrassed his boss and hosted a show that seemed to contradict the network's 'no bias' brand.\" \n\nDobbs holds anti-immigration views. Dobbs has been strongly opposed to both illegal immigration and foreign worker programs as the H-1B visa program and guest-worker programs. In a 2006 article, Dobbs expressed frustration at failed legislation to build a southern \"border fence to stop the flow of illegal aliens and drugs across our borders.\" He argued that the \"true victims of corporate America's lust for cheap labor\" were \"American working men and women, taxpayers all.\"\n\nDobbs' show has made factually incorrect claims, such as the one that illegal immigrants were responsible for bringing 7,000 new cases of leprosy to the United States in a three-year period, where the actual timeframe was over the last thirty years. In addressing the leprosy issue, Dobbs in May 2007 compared his critics from the left and right political spectrums to \"commies\" and \"fascists.\"\n\nDobbs has criticized local officials for their approach to border security. In October 2007 he labeled then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer an \"idiot\" for advocating the issuance of driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. Hillary Clinton labeled Dobbs' illegal immigration segments as having \"all that hot air.\"\n\nAt about 10:30 a.m. on October 5, 2009, a bullet struck Dobbs' home as his wife stood outside it. The bullet struck the vinyl siding of their attic without penetrating the vinyl and fell to the ground. Dobbs attributed the incident to his stance against amnesty for illegal immigrants. The New Jersey State Police troopers' account of the incident attributed it to a stray bullet from a hunter in the vicinity.\n\nIn a November 2009 interview with Telemundo, Dobbs said that the U.S. needed a \"rational, effective humane policy\" for immigration that included enhanced border security and also \"the ability to legalize illegal immigrants on certain conditions.\"\n\nIn March 2009, Dobbs said he thought that there should not be a St. Patricks Day.\n\nIn October 2010, \"The Nation\" published the results of a yearlong investigation detailing undocumented workers who had worked on Dobbs' personal properties. The labor involved upkeep of Dobbs' multimillion-dollar estates in New Jersey and Florida, including the horses belonging to his daughter, Hillary, a champion show jumper. The article featured interviews with five immigrants who had worked without papers on Dobbs' properties. Dobbs and his daughter had declined to comment to \"The Nation\" as part of the story. Speaking to the Associated Press, Dobbs referred to the article as \"a political assault,\" claiming it was a lie that he hired illegal immigrants. He said: \"I have never, do not now, and never will.\"\n\nIn November 2018, Dobbs falsely claimed that \"many\" undocumented immigrants voted in the 2018 mid-term elections and that they had an \"immense impact.\"\n\nDobbs' critics, including columnist James K. Glassman, author of \"Dow 36,000\" and member of the American Enterprise Institute think tank, have accused him of inciting xenophobia. Others have accused him of Hispanophobia, a charge he denies and one which he has said offends him deeply, as his wife Debi Segura is a Mexican-American.\n\nOn his show \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\", Dobbs stopped short of a full endorsement of Presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying, \"Whatever you think of Trump, whatever your politics, Trump has taken on enormous risk and threats in seeking the presidency ... promised to restore the voice of the people ... and a government that will respect all that our Constitution assures.\" Dobbs has since endorsed Donald Trump. In October 2017, Dobbs said that the Trump presidency \"may be the most accomplished in modern American history.\" Trump praised Dobbs in return. Later that month, Dobbs interviewed Trump, with numerous observers describing Dobbs's interview style as fawning and sycophantic. Dobbs opened the interview with \"You have accomplished so much\", and later said to Trump that he was \"one of the most loved and respected\" presidents \"in history.\" The \"New York Times\" described the interview as a love-fest and \"courtier-like session\", as Dobbs \"didn't so much ask questions as open his mouth and let rose petals fall out\". Dobbs has been described as a \"close informal adviser to President Donald Trump.\"\n\nOn October 13, 2016, Dobbs publicized by Twitter a link which contained the address and phone number of a woman who was among several who had come forward with allegations of being sexually assaulted by Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nTrump repeatedly calls Dobbs to get his views on various policy issues. In 2017 Trump patched Dobbs into senior-level Oval Office meetings multiple times, sometimes interrupting officials to ask for Dobbs' opinions.\n\nDobbs is a proponent of the Deep State conspiracy theory. In January 2018, Dobbs called for a \"war\" on the \"Deep State\", which he described as the FBI and the Department of Justice. Dobbs said that the FBI and DOJ had destroyed evidence and that they were clandestinely working to bring down the Trump presidency. In June 2018, Dobbs promoted a conspiracy which originated on Reddit and the far-right conspiracy website Gateway Pundit that \"the FBI May have initiated a number of spies into the Trump campaign as early as December of 2015.\" Shortly after Dobbs promoted the unfounded conspiracy theory, Trump retweeted Dobbs' assertion and praised Dobbs for a \"great interview\". In July 2018, Dobbs said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was on a \"jihad\" against Trump, and accused him of seeking to \"subvert\" and \"overthrow\" Trump's presidency.\n\nAfter Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not investigating alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Dobbs attacked Sessions, saying that he had become physically or mentally unwell. Dobbs said, \"Sessions has fallen ill, he's incapacitated in some fashion, or he's been coopted or captured: to preserve any dignity, for the good of the country he needs to resign.\"\n\nIn July 2018, Dobbs defended the Trump administration's decision to ban a CNN reporter from a press event. Multiple Fox colleagues, including Fox News President Jay Wallace, had shown solidarity with CNN and called on the White House to rescind the ban. In 2012, when a \"Daily Caller\" reporter was criticized by the White House for shouting out a question during an address by Obama, Dobbs defended the reporter, saying \"What is rude is a president not speaking to the American people and taking the questions of the White House press.\" \"CNN\"'s Jake Tapper suggested that Dobbs was hypocritical, saying \"Lou Dobbs, it might surprise you to find out, had a very different take on the situation... Sometimes I find some people in this environment, you will be interested to know, say the exact opposite thing about President Trump than they did about President Obama.\"\n\nIn August 2018, Dobbs called CNN journalist Jim Acosta \"delicate\" and \"triggered\" after Acosta recorded a hostile crowd Trump supporters at a rally harassing him.\n\nThat same month, Dobbs ran a segment pushing unsubstantiated claims that Google was biased against Trump and that Google was promoting anti-Trump stories. Following Dobbs' segment, Trump tweeted that Google was suppressing conservatives and he tasked economic adviser Larry Kudlow to look into regulating Google.\n\nIn September 2018, after Trump falsely claimed that the official death count from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico were fabricated by Democrats, Dobbs defended Trump's assertion. Dobbs claimed that \"the numbers were inflated\" and that the organizations behind the numbers \"threw out science, statistics, and evidence to discredit the Trump administration.\"\n\nIn October 2018, when CNN and a number of prominent Democrats were targeted with bomb attempts, Dobbs described the bomb attempts as \"fake news\" and promoted conspiracy theories that the bomb attempts were by Democrats who sought to increase their support in the upcoming mid-term elections. Several Fox News employees expressed dismay over Dobbs' rhetoric, with one employee telling CNN, \"It's people like Dobbs who really ruin it for all the hard working journalists at Fox.\"\n\nWhen the Trump administration rescinded CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass, Dobbs supported the administration. At the same time, numerous media organizations, including Fox News, spoke out against the Trump administration's decision. When U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, temporarily restored Acosta's press pass, Dobbs described the ruling as \"absurd.\" When the Trump administration complied with the ruling, Dobbs called on the administration to ignore the ruling and tell the \"district court judge to go to hell.\"\n\nDobbs has peddled numerous conspiracy theories about the Jewish-American philanthropist and businessman George Soros. Dobbs has referred to him as an \"evil SOB\" and insidious. \n\nDobbs's Fox Business Channel shows stirred controversy in October 2018 when a guest on Dobbs' show used what many described as an anti-Semitic trope to suggest that the State Department was \"Soros-occupied\" territory (which echoed the anti-Semitic trope of a \"Zionist-occupied government\"). The remarks came days after bombing attempts on Soros, and the remarks were replayed on Fox Business hours after an anti-Semitic attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue which killed 11 people. After widespread condemnation, Fox stated that the guest, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch, would no longer be booked.\n\nDobbs was a registered Republican. Though he made a donation of $1,000 to the Bush-Cheney campaign in January 2001, he often has described the Bush administration and the then Republican-controlled Congress as \"disgraceful.\" He has also argued that both parties are controlled by corporate interests.\n\nDobbs is pro-choice, opposes gun control and, though he is a fiscal conservative, supports some government regulations, as revealed in a \"60 Minutes\" interview. He has been critical of trade policies that he says encourage \"sending jobs overseas\".\n\nDobbs' stance on trade has earned plaudits from some trade union activists on the traditional political left, while his stance on immigration tends to appeal to the right. In an interview with Larry King, Dobbs revealed that he is now \"an unaffiliated independent\" owing to dissatisfaction with both the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nIn June 2006, as the U.S. Senate debated the Federal Marriage Amendment, Dobbs was critical of the action. He asserted that marriage was threatened more by financial crises perpetuated by Bush administration economic policy than by same-sex marriage.\n\nDobbs is the author of \"War on the Middle Class\", in which he claims that both Democrats and Republicans are harming the middle class. In it, he comes out strongly against the Bush tax cuts, which he argues favor the wealthy, and argued for raising the U.S. minimum wage from what was then $5.15 an hour.\n\nDobbs has also been criticized for his lack of journalistic ethics by liberal news journalist Amy Goodman. She accused him of flagrant errors in his reporting and his staff's association with disreputable sources, stating that \"he has a special responsibility to rely on facts and to correct misstatements of fact.\"\n\nDobbs has won numerous major awards for his television journalism, most notably a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award and a Cable Ace Award. He received the George Foster Peabody Award for his coverage of the 1987 stock market crash. He also has received the Luminary Award of the Business Journalism Review in 1990, the Horatio Alger Association Award for Distinguished Americans in 1999 and the National Space Club Media Award in 2000. \"The Wall Street Journal\" has named Dobbs \"TV's Premier Business News Anchorman\". In 2004, Dobbs was awarded the Eugene Katz Award For Excellence in the Coverage of Immigration by the Center for Immigration Studies and in 2005 he received the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution's Statesmanship Award. Dobbs was named \"Father of the Year\" by the National Father's Day Committee in 1993. In 2008 Dobbs received the American Legion Public Relations Award from the National Commander of The American Legion.\n\n\n\n"}

He went on to study medicine at University College London Medical School, but in 1964 quit the program to enroll at Balliol College, Oxford, receiving BA degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics. As president of the university's Overseas Student Union, he became friends with a number of future Botswana notables, including later Minister of Mineral Resources and Water Affairs David Magang and future President of Botswana Festus Mogae.\n\nAfter working for Procter and Gamble in Caracas, Venezuela, and southern Africa, Nchindo rose to become the managing director of Debswana, the chairman of the Botswana Stock Exchange, Botswana head for Barclays Bank and resident director of Anglo American in Botswana.

Following his September 2004 retirement, Nchindo was awarded Botswana's highest honor, the Presidential Order of Honour Award, by Former President of the Botswana Festus Mogae during the country's Independence Day celebrations, although he did not attend to ceremony. Prior to this, Nchindo had also gained press attention when he fired 461 Debswana workers for engaging in industrial action.\n\nIn 2008 Gaborone Chief Magistrate Lot Moroka brought corruption charges against Nchindo, which were ongoing at the time of his death. During this trial, he revealed that he had arranged secret loans from DeBeers to former President Quett Masire, causing a political scandal. He was slated to appear before the court on 6 April 2010 to answer 36 charges of corruption dating from his period as head of Debswana.\n\nNchindo was last seen at a local Bottle store on the evening of 7 February in pandamatenga.

Baker helped to shape the surf apparel industry as president and chief executive of Ocean Pacific, also known as OP.\n\nBaker was born on September 3, 1946 in Los Angeles. He grew up in the San Fernando Valley and earned his bachelor's degree from California State University, Northridge.\n\nBaker first entered the apparel industry as a college student. He became a buyer at a men's specialty store to pay for school. He later became a buyer for the now defunct Bullock's department store.\n\nBaker became head of the Marithé François Girbaud's U.S. division, based in New York City, in 1980. He gradually moved on to head other clothing brands. In 1983, Baker became the president and chief executive of Izod Ltd.'s menswear division. He became president of Esprit Sport in 1986 before later moving on to become the head of Tommy Hilfiger's women's clothing division.\n\nIn 1998, Baker and his partners at the Doyle & Boissiere investment group, which is based in Burlingame, California, acquired the Ocean Pacific heritage surf brand. Ocean Pacific was in financial trouble at the time as consumer preferences had changed over the years.\n\nBaker became the chief executive of Ocean Pacific following the 1998 acquisition. He was able to successfully revive the flagging label. Under his helm, Baker led Ocean Pacific through two sales. The first was to Warnaco Group in 2004, which acquired Ocean Pacific for $40 million. The second sale, in 2006, was to Iconix Brand Group, a surf wear maker, for an estimated $54 million.\n\nBaker remained the president of Ocean Pacific until he stepped down in 2006, and continued as a consultant with the company until 2007.\n\nBaker joined the board of directors of the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association (SIMA), based in Aliso Viejo, California, in 2000 while he was the chief executive of Ocean Pacific.

The \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that as head of SIMA, Baker directed the business of \"selling surf to the suits\" in the larger business community. He also served as a mentor to the CEOs and heads of other surf oriented apparel brands. Fernando Aguerre, the co-founder of Reef clothing company and current chief executive of Liquid Tribe, later called Baker, \"part father, part brother and part friend.\"\n\nIn a speech to a surf insutry gathering in San José del Cabo, Mexico, in May 2005, Baker told attendees that, \"Surf is on the world stage, and this hard-core, laid-back industry has been discovered by the suits. The non- endemic business types see this as an area of growth, and if you see this as a threat, then get a life -- it's a compliment.\"\n\nBaker also told the surf industry to use their influence to do good works saying in 2006, \"Pick your spot and make a difference...Whether you're big or small, give back what you can.\"\n\nRichard Baker died on April 14, 2009, at Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, California, after a two-year battle with cancer. He was 62 years old and was survived by his wife of 19 years, Una Baker; sons, Ryan and Jack; his father, Donald Baker, and his sister, Donna Smith Vigil.\n\nThe Surf Industry Manufacturers Association announced that its plans to honor Baker with its Lifetime Achievement Award at its 20th annual Waterman's Ball in August 2009.\n\nRichard Woolcott, the founder and CEO of Volcom told the \"LA Times\", \"Dick was a great friend, mentor and role model to many of us in the industry. He understood the magic of action sports and helped us harness it into big-picture thinking and execution. But most of all, he was a wonderful human being with a loving heart and spirit. He was always supportive in what we were doing, lending his advice and positive feedback. He was a blessing to this industry and will be deeply missed.\"\n\nFernando Aguerre, founder of Reef, said in reaction to Baker's death, \"And I feel like an orphan today.\"\n"}

{"id": "48334231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48334231", "title": "Roger De Clerck", "text": "Roger De Clerck\n\nRoger De Clerck (July 27, 1924 – October 23, 2015) was a Belgian entrepreneur and CEO of the Beaulieu textile group. An international business man, his family was ranked 15th place in a list of \"richest Belgians\". During his lifetime he was controversial due to a series of scandals where he and his company were accused of fiscal fraud.\n\nDe Clerck born in Wielsbeke, the second son of a flax farmer who owned a large farm, \"Ter Lembeek\" there. His two brothers became priests. He was a nephew of minister (father of politician Stefaan De Clerck) and the brother of Thérèse De Clerck, wife of , founder of Roularta.\n\nIn 1951 De Clerck married Anne-Marie Hanssens from Gullegem. In normal circumstances he would have taken over his father's farm, but the flax market collapsed around this time and he was forced to look for another source of income. De Clerck decided to produce looms and later carpets. In 1959 he founded the carpet company \"Beaulieu\", which became an international trader in the next few decades. He also became a politically active member of the CVP.\n\nIn 1991, because of internal struggles between his heirs, De Clerck divided his empire among them. Jan De Clerck received \"Domo\". Luc became head of \"Berry Group\". Mieke of \"Associated Weavers\". Francis \"Ideal Group\". Ann \"Beaulieu Kruishoutem\" and Dominiek \"Ter Lembeek\". Five of his six children kept their head department in Belgium, only Mieke moved hers to the USA.\n\nIn 1992 Jan De Clerck's eleven-year-old son, Anthony De Clerck, was kidnapped by the gang of Danny Vanhamel. A ransom of 250 million Belgian francs was demanded, but after a month Anthony was freed and the kidnappers arrested.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s \"Beaulieu\" felt more rivalry from foreign companies. In 2005 four branches of the company were merged into one company \"Beaulieu International Group\", which is still the largest West European carpet group. The only branches that were kept out were \"Domo\" (because Jan had fallen into dishonor with his father) and \"Beaulieu in America\" (which Mieke preferred to keep independent). At this point none of the De Clercks was part of the daily management and in October 2005 De Clerck himself also stepped down.\n\nIn 1987 Roger De Clerck had his first run-in with the law. He was suspected of having exported large fortune from his companies to foreign counties under the veil of commission fees. A money export of about 1,5 to 2 billion Belgian francs were traced. He was found guilty, but his punishment was dismissed because his social position and the employment of his personnel could become endangered. In 1989 five business employees, including his sons Jan and Dominiek, spent a week in jail in England, because they had sold their carpets in black market money. Couriers smuggled the money in their clothing and luggage to Belgium. Two years later De Clerck bought his sons off with 2 million euro, without any prosecution or conviction coming about.\n\nIn 1997 Jan De Clerck and his partner Martine Van De Weghe were arrested. An associate of Jan, Ronny Verhoeven - who was a banker at Generale Bank in Sint-Niklaas - had whitewashed black market money through fake commission fees and bills. Verhoeven admitted this fraud in September 1997. In April 1998 Jan De Clerck was forced to do the same. Him and his wife admitted the fraud and paid 2,5 million euro. A year later they paid another 50 million euro to pay off their overdue personnel taxes and venture taxes. This caused a drift between them and the rest of the family, who kept repeating they were innocent.\n\nRoger De Clerck himself was suspected from forgery of documents, gang organisation and violation of the laws for venture taxes. He was also thought to have tried to bribe investigation judges and researchers. The Beaulieu group was thought to have had paid fake commission payments to a Libanese business family for years. They officially acted as middle man for the sales in the Middle-East and Russia, but according to the researchers they were simply straw men. Their commission payments on sold products were meant to scoop off the profits of the Beaulieu branches and were returned to the family in the shape of loans, investments or black market money. The case kept going for years. In April 2014 it was revealed that a new research was started to clear out suspicions of whitewashing in a Luxembourgian venture. Business shares which belonged to a Libanese businessman were carried over to the De Clerck family.\n\nDespite his massive wealth and large company imperium De Clerck was often nicknamed \"Boer Clerck\" (\"Farmer Clerck\") in the media, because of his roots in the farming industry, his local dialect and his simple-minded behavior. He detested this nickname himself.\n\nIn 1999 De Clerck celebrated his 75th birthday. This event attracted a lot of press attention when he invited world-famous politicians to meet him at his garden party, including Margaret Thatcher and George H.W. Bush. Mikhail Gorbachev was invited too, but had to excuse himself because his wife, Raisa Gorbachev, was seriously ill. She would die that same year. De Clerck's son Jan was not invited because he had fallen into disgrace.\n\nDe Clerck died in 2015 at the age of 91.\n"}

{"id": "231920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231920", "title": "Scheduling (computing)", "text": "Scheduling (computing)\n\nIn computing, scheduling is the method by which work specified by some means is assigned to resources that complete the work. The work may be virtual computation elements such as threads, processes or data flows, which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as processors, network links or expansion cards.\n\nA scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity. Schedulers are often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy (as in load balancing), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively, or to achieve a target quality of service. Scheduling is fundamental to computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the execution model of a computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have computer multitasking with a single central processing unit (CPU).\n\nA scheduler may aim at one or more of many goals, for example: \n\nmaximizing \"throughput\" (the total amount of work completed per time unit); \n\nminimizing \"wait time\" \n(time from work becoming enabled until the first point it begins execution on resources); \n\nminimizing \"latency\" or \"response time\" (time from work becoming enabled until it is finished in case of batch activity,\n\nor until the system responds and hands the first output to the user in case of interactive activity);\n\nor maximizing \"fairness\" (equal CPU time to each process, or more generally appropriate times according to the priority and workload of each process). In practice, these goals often conflict (e.g. throughput versus latency), thus a scheduler will implement a suitable compromise. Preference is measured by any one of the concerns mentioned above, depending upon the user's needs and objectives.\n\nIn real-time environments, such as embedded systems for automatic control in industry (for example robotics), the scheduler also must ensure that processes can meet deadlines; this is crucial for keeping the system stable. Scheduled tasks can also be distributed to remote devices across a network and managed through an administrative back end.\n\nThe scheduler is an operating system module that selects the next jobs to be admitted into the system and the next process to run. Operating systems may feature up to three distinct scheduler types: a \"long-term scheduler\" (also known as an admission scheduler or high-level scheduler), a \"mid-term or medium-term scheduler\", and a \"short-term scheduler\". The names suggest the relative frequency with which their functions are performed.\n\nThe process scheduler is a part of the operating system that decides which process runs at a certain point in time. It usually has the ability to pause a running process, move it to the back of the running queue and start a new process; such a scheduler is known as \"preemptive scheduler\", otherwise it is a \"cooperative scheduler\".\n\nThe \"long-term scheduler\", or \"admission scheduler\", decides which jobs or processes are to be admitted to the ready queue (in main memory); that is, when an attempt is made to execute a program, its admission to the set of currently executing processes is either authorized or delayed by the long-term scheduler. Thus, this scheduler dictates what processes are to run on a system, and the degree of concurrency to be supported at any one time whether many or few processes are to be executed concurrently, and how the split between I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive processes is to be handled. The long-term scheduler is responsible for controlling the degree of multiprogramming.\n\nIn general, most processes can be described as either I/O-bound or CPU-bound. An I/O-bound process is one that spends more of its time doing I/O than it spends doing computations. A CPU-bound process, in contrast, generates I/O requests infrequently, using more of its time doing computations. It is important that a long-term scheduler selects a good process mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes. If all processes are I/O-bound, the ready queue will almost always be empty, and the short-term scheduler will have little to do. On the other hand, if all processes are CPU-bound, the I/O waiting queue will almost always be empty, devices will go unused, and again the system will be unbalanced. The system with the best performance will thus have a combination of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes. In modern operating systems, this is used to make sure that real-time processes get enough CPU time to finish their tasks.\n\nLong-term scheduling is also important in large-scale systems such as batch processing systems, computer clusters, supercomputers, and render farms. For example, in concurrent systems, coscheduling of interacting processes is often required to prevent them from blocking due to waiting on each other. In these cases, special-purpose job scheduler software is typically used to assist these functions, in addition to any underlying admission scheduling support in the operating system.\n\nThe \"medium-term scheduler\" temporarily removes processes from main memory and places them in secondary memory (such as a hard disk drive) or vice versa, which is commonly referred to as \"swapping out\" or \"swapping in\" (also incorrectly as \"paging out\" or \"paging in\"). The medium-term scheduler may decide to swap out a process which has not been active for some time, or a process which has a low priority, or a process which is page faulting frequently, or a process which is taking up a large amount of memory in order to free up main memory for other processes, swapping the process back in later when more memory is available, or when the process has been unblocked and is no longer waiting for a resource. [Stallings, 396] [Stallings, 370]\n\nIn many systems today (those that support mapping virtual address space to secondary storage other than the swap file), the medium-term scheduler may actually perform the role of the long-term scheduler, by treating binaries as \"swapped out processes\" upon their execution. In this way, when a segment of the binary is required it can be swapped in on demand, or \"lazy loaded\". [Stallings, 394]\n\nThe \"short-term scheduler\" (also known as the \"CPU scheduler\") decides which of the ready, in-memory processes is to be executed (allocated a CPU) after a clock interrupt, an I/O interrupt, an operating system call or another form of signal. Thus the short-term scheduler makes scheduling decisions much more frequently than the long-term or mid-term schedulersa scheduling decision will at a minimum have to be made after every time slice, and these are very short. This scheduler can be preemptive, implying that it is capable of forcibly removing processes from a CPU when it decides to allocate that CPU to another process, or non-preemptive (also known as \"voluntary\" or \"co-operative\"), in which case the scheduler is unable to \"force\" processes off the CPU.\n\nA preemptive scheduler relies upon a programmable interval timer which invokes an interrupt handler that runs in kernel mode and implements the scheduling function.\n\nAnother component that is involved in the CPU-scheduling function is the dispatcher, which is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler. It receives control in kernel mode as the result of an interrupt or system call. The functions of a dispatcher involve the following:\n\n\nThe dispatcher should be as fast as possible, since it is invoked during every process switch. During the context switches, the processor is virtually idle for a fraction of time, thus unnecessary context switches should be avoided. The time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another is known as the \"dispatch latency\".\n\nScheduling disciplines are algorithms used for distributing resources among parties which simultaneously and asynchronously request them. Scheduling disciplines are used in routers (to handle packet traffic) as well as in operating systems (to share CPU time among both threads and processes), disk drives (I/O scheduling), printers (print spooler), most embedded systems, etc.\n\nThe main purposes of scheduling algorithms are to minimize resource starvation and to ensure fairness amongst the parties utilizing the resources. Scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the outstanding requests is to be allocated resources. There are many different scheduling algorithms. In this section, we introduce several of them.\n\nIn packet-switched computer networks and other statistical multiplexing, the notion of a scheduling algorithm is used as an alternative to first-come first-served queuing of data packets.\n\nThe simplest best-effort scheduling algorithms are round-robin, fair queuing (a max-min fair scheduling algorithm), proportionally fair scheduling and maximum throughput. If differentiated or guaranteed quality of service is offered, as opposed to best-effort communication, weighted fair queuing may be utilized.\n\nIn advanced packet radio wireless networks such as HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access) 3.5G cellular system, channel-dependent scheduling may be used to take advantage of channel state information. If the channel conditions are favourable, the throughput and system spectral efficiency may be increased. In even more advanced systems such as LTE, the scheduling is combined by channel-dependent packet-by-packet dynamic channel allocation, or by assigning OFDMA multi-carriers or other frequency-domain equalization components to the users that best can utilize them.\n\n\"First in, first out\" (FIFO), also known as \"first come, first served\" (FCFS), is the simplest scheduling algorithm. FIFO simply queues processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue. This is commonly used for a , for example as illustrated in this section.\n\n\nEarliest deadline first (EDF) or \"least time to go\" is a dynamic scheduling algorithm used in real-time operating systems to place processes in a priority queue. Whenever a scheduling event occurs (a task finishes, new task is released, etc.), the queue will be searched for the process closest to its deadline, which will be the next to be scheduled for execution.\n\nSimilar to shortest job first (SJF). With this strategy the scheduler arranges processes with the least estimated processing time remaining to be next in the queue. This requires advanced knowledge or estimations about the time required for a process to complete.\n\n\nThe operating system assigns a fixed priority rank to every process, and the scheduler arranges the processes in the ready queue in order of their priority. Lower-priority processes get interrupted by incoming higher-priority processes.\n\nThe scheduler assigns a fixed time unit per process, and cycles through them. If process completes within that time-slice it gets terminated otherwise it is rescheduled after giving a chance to all other processes.\n\n\nThis is used for situations in which processes are easily divided into different groups. For example, a common division is made between foreground (interactive) processes and background (batch) processes. These two types of processes have different response-time requirements and so may have different scheduling needs. It is very useful for shared memory problems.\n\nA work-conserving scheduler is a scheduler that always tries to keep the scheduled resources busy, if there are submitted jobs ready to be scheduled. In contrast, a non-work conserving scheduler is a scheduler that, in some cases, may leave the scheduled resources idle despite the presence of jobs ready to be scheduled.\n\nThere are several scheduling problems in which the goal is to decide which job goes to which station at what time, such that the total makespan is minimized:\n\nA very common method in embedded systems is to schedule jobs manually. This can for example be done in a time-multiplexed fashion. Sometimes the kernel is divided in three or more parts: Manual scheduling, preemptive and interrupt level. Exact methods for scheduling jobs are often proprietary.\n\n\nWhen designing an operating system, a programmer must consider which scheduling algorithm will perform best for the use the system is going to see. There is no universal “best” scheduling algorithm, and many operating systems use extended or combinations of the scheduling algorithms above.\n\nFor example, Windows NT/XP/Vista uses a multilevel feedback queue, a combination of fixed-priority preemptive scheduling, round-robin, and first in, first out algorithms. In this system, threads can dynamically increase or decrease in priority depending on if it has been serviced already, or if it has been waiting extensively. Every priority level is represented by its own queue, with round-robin scheduling among the high-priority threads and FIFO among the lower-priority ones. In this sense, response time is short for most threads, and short but critical system threads get completed very quickly. Since threads can only use one time unit of the round-robin in the highest-priority queue, starvation can be a problem for longer high-priority threads.\n\nThe algorithm used may be as simple as round-robin in which each process is given equal time (for instance 1 ms, usually between 1 ms and 100 ms) in a cycling list. So, process A executes for 1 ms, then process B, then process C, then back to process A.\n\nMore advanced algorithms take into account process priority, or the importance of the process. This allows some processes to use more time than other processes. The kernel always uses whatever resources it needs to ensure proper functioning of the system, and so can be said to have infinite priority. In SMP(symmetric multiprocessing) systems, processor affinity is considered to increase overall system performance, even if it may cause a process itself to run more slowly. This generally improves performance by reducing cache thrashing.\n\nIBM OS/360 was available with three different schedulers. The differences were such that the variants were often considered three different operating systems:\n\n\nLater virtual storage versions of MVS added a \"Workload Manager\" feature to the scheduler, which schedules processor resources according to an elaborate scheme defined by the installation.\n\nVery early MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows systems were non-multitasking, and as such did not feature a scheduler. Windows 3.1x used a non-preemptive scheduler, meaning that it did not interrupt programs. It relied on the program to end or tell the OS that it didn't need the processor so that it could move on to another process. This is usually called cooperative multitasking. Windows 95 introduced a rudimentary preemptive scheduler; however, for legacy support opted to let 16 bit applications run without preemption.\n\nWindows NT-based operating systems use a multilevel feedback queue. 32 priority levels are defined, 0 through to 31, with priorities 0 through 15 being \"normal\" priorities and priorities 16 through 31 being soft real-time priorities, requiring privileges to assign. 0 is reserved for the Operating System. Users can select 5 of these priorities to assign to a running application from the Task Manager application, or through thread management APIs. The kernel may change the priority level of a thread depending on its I/O and CPU usage and whether it is interactive (i.e. accepts and responds to input from humans), raising the priority of interactive and I/O bounded processes and lowering that of CPU bound processes, to increase the responsiveness of interactive applications. The scheduler was modified in Windows Vista to use the cycle counter register of modern processors to keep track of exactly how many CPU cycles a thread has executed, rather than just using an interval-timer interrupt routine. Vista also uses a priority scheduler for the I/O queue so that disk defragmenters and other such programs do not interfere with foreground operations.\n\nMac OS 9 uses cooperative scheduling for threads, where one process controls multiple cooperative threads, and also provides preemptive scheduling for multiprocessing tasks. The kernel schedules multiprocessing tasks using a preemptive scheduling algorithm. All Process Manager processes run within a special multiprocessing task, called the \"blue task\". Those processes are scheduled cooperatively, using a round-robin scheduling algorithm; a process yields control of the processor to another process by explicitly calling a such as codice_1. Each process has its own copy of the Thread Manager that schedules that process's threads cooperatively; a thread yields control of the processor to another thread by calling codice_2 or codice_3.\n\nmacOS uses a multilevel feedback queue, with four priority bands for threadsnormal, system high priority, kernel mode only, and real-time. Threads are scheduled preemptively; macOS also supports cooperatively scheduled threads in its implementation of the Thread Manager in Carbon.\n\nIn AIX Version 4 there are three possible values for thread scheduling policy:\n\n\nThreads are primarily of interest for applications that currently consist of several asynchronous processes. These applications might impose a lighter load on the system if converted to a multithreaded structure.\n\nAIX 5 implements the following scheduling policies: FIFO, round robin, and a fair round robin. The FIFO policy has three different implementations: FIFO, FIFO2, and FIFO3. The round robin policy is named SCHED_RR in AIX, and the fair round robin is called SCHED_OTHER.\n\nIn Linux 2.4, an O(n) scheduler with a multilevel feedback queue with priority levels ranging from 0 to 140 was used; 0–99 are reserved for real-time tasks and 100–140 are considered nice task levels. For real-time tasks, the time quantum for switching processes was approximately 200 ms, and for nice tasks approximately 10 ms. The scheduler ran through the run queue of all ready processes, letting the highest priority processes go first and run through their time slices, after which they will be placed in an expired queue. When the active queue is empty the expired queue will become the active queue and vice versa.\n\nHowever, some enterprise Linux distributions such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server replaced this scheduler with a backport of the O(1) scheduler (which was maintained by Alan Cox in his Linux 2.4-ac Kernel series) to the Linux 2.4 kernel used by the distribution.\n\nIn versions 2.6.0 to 2.6.22, the kernel used an O(1) scheduler developed by Ingo Molnar and many other kernel developers during the Linux 2.5 development. For many kernel in time frame, Con Kolivas developed patch sets which improved interactivity with this scheduler or even replaced it with his own schedulers.\n\nCon Kolivas's work, most significantly his implementation of \"fair scheduling\" named \"Rotating Staircase Deadline\", inspired Ingo Molnár to develop the Completely Fair Scheduler as a replacement for the earlier O(1) scheduler, crediting Kolivas in his announcement. CFS is the first implementation of a fair queuing process scheduler widely used in a general-purpose operating system.\n\nThe Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) uses a well-studied, classic scheduling algorithm called fair queuing originally invented for packet networks. Fair queuing had been previously applied to CPU scheduling under the name stride scheduling. The fair queuing CFS scheduler has a scheduling complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of tasks in the runqueue. Choosing a task can be done in constant time, but reinserting a task after it has run requires O(log N) operations, because the run queue is implemented as a red-black tree.\n\nThe Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS), also created by Con Kolivas, is an alternative to the CFS.\n\nFreeBSD uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–255. 0–63 are reserved for interrupts, 64–127 for the top half of the kernel, 128–159 for real-time user threads, 160–223 for time-shared user threads, and 224–255 for idle user threads. Also, like Linux, it uses the active queue setup, but it also has an idle queue.\n\nNetBSD uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–223. 0–63 are reserved for time-shared threads (default, SCHED_OTHER policy), 64–95 for user threads which entered kernel space, 96-128 for kernel threads, 128–191 for user real-time threads (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies), and 192–223 for software interrupts.\n\nSolaris uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging between 0 and 169. Priorities 0–59 are reserved for time-shared threads, 60–99 for system threads, 100–159 for real-time threads, and 160–169 for low priority interrupts. Unlike Linux, when a process is done using its time quantum, it is given a new priority and put back in the queue. Solaris 9 introduced two new scheduling classes, namely fixed priority class and fair share class. The threads with fixed priority have the same priority range as that of the time-sharing class, but their priorities are not dynamically adjusted. The fair scheduling class uses CPU \"shares\" to prioritize threads for scheduling decisions. CPU shares indicate the entitlement to CPU resources. They are allocated to a set of processes, which are collectively known as a project.\n\n"}

It belongs to the Saxon State Ministry of Finance and has the aim of preserving Saxon cultural heritage whilst respecting cultural and conservation needs. The state-owned company manages several palaces, castles and parks in the Saxony. These include the Zwinger in Dresden, the Albrechtsburg in Meissen and Kriebstein Castle.\n\nFollowing the restoration of the Free State of Saxony on 3 October 1990, assets that had already been owned in the past by the state, or which had been managed during the East German era as legal entities under the Asset Allocation Act, were transferred into the ownership of the new German state.\n\nStarting on the first of January 1992, the state took over the following properties: Dresden Castle including the Johanneum and the Stallhof, the Dresden Zwinger and the Zwinger Gardens, the Japanese Palace with its palace garden, Pillnitz Castle and park, Moritzburg Palace and the surrounding landscape gardens, the Albrechtsburg in Meißen, Königstein Fortress, Schloss Weesenstein, Gnandstein Castle, Frauenstein castle ruins, Großsedlitz Baroque Gardens, Hubertusburg Palace, Nischwitz Palace, Stolpen Castle, Augustusburg Palace, Lichtenwalde Palace, the palace and park at Bad Muskau, Colditz Castle, Altzella Abbey, Nossen Palace, Wiederau Palace, Mildenstein Castle and the Ortenburg\n\nIn the following years, other historic buildings were allocated to the Free State of Saxony.\n\nWith a cabinet decision on third November 1992, 17 independent state companies were formed for some of the most important sites and placed under commercial management. These companies together formed the State Palaces Department (\"Staatliche Schlösserverwaltung\"). During the implementation phase, between 1 April 1993 and 1 January 1994, 15 state-owned enterprises were founded for the following properties:<ref name=\"2/10146\">Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 2/10146</ref>\n\nIn addition, the Palaces Department managed the following properties directly: the Albertinum, the Catholic Court Church, the Jägerhof, the Royal Burial Chapel at Freiberg, Colditz Castle, Lichtenwalde Palace and the Exhibition Hall of the Academy of Art.\n\nThe following properties remained under the administration of local authority land offices: the Japanese Palace, Siebeneichen Palace, Reinhardtsgrimma Palace, the Ortenburg, Hubertusburg Palace, Freudenstein Castle, Wurzen Palace, Grimma Palace Königswartha Palace, Suchominsky Villa, Sonnenstein Castle, Dippoldiswalde Palace, the Niederlauterstein castle ruins, the Frauenstein castle ruins, Wachwitz Palace, the Royal Villa, Lützschena Palace, Thallwitz Palace, the Grillenburg Hunting Lodge, Brauna Palace, the Keppschloss, Zehren-Schieritz Palace, Königsbrück Palace, Gaussig House, Hohenprießnitz Palace and Ruhenthal Palace. Many of these sites were later transferred to the towns and cities in which they were situated or sold off to third parties.\n\nOn 1 March 1996 the Saxon Palaces Department was incorporated into the State Finance Office. On 1 July 2000 the companies running Königstein Fortress on the one hand and the castles of Augustusburg, Lichtenwalde, and Scharfenstein on the other hand were turned in a charitable company. Their owner remains the Free State of Saxony. The management of those involved is carried out by the Palaces Department.\n\nIn the period from 1993 to 2003 the Palaces Department's share of the cost rose from 37% to 61.4%. As of 1 January 2003, the Palaces Department was separate from the State Office and a common public enterprise, the \"State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony\", was founded. The palace companies are its individual business units.\n\nIn 2005, the advertising association \"Schlösserland Sachsen\" (Castles of Saxony) was created, a federation of major governmental and non-governmental heritage building and gardens groups, which has the task of preserviing, maintaining and displaying Saxony's cultural monuments. Under this umbrella brand, in cooperation with the Saxony Tourism Marketing Corporation (TMGS), more than 50 castles, palaces, gardens, fortresses and castle hotels are marketed both nationwide and internationally.\n\nThe following palaces, castles and abbeys are partners in the \"Werbegemeinschaft Schlösserland Sachsen\":\n\nIn addition there are the properties owned by the hotel and hospitality industry: Hohnstein Castle, \"Churfuerstliche Waldschänke Moritzburg, Europa-Jugendherberge Schloss Colditz, Pension Zur Königlichen Ausspanne, Schloss Hotel Dresden-Pillnitz\" and \"Schlosshotel Gaußig\".\n\nThe state-owned palaces, castles and gardens receive about two million visitors every year.\n\nThe head office of the state company has five divisions under the management of Christian Striefler. The individual palace business units are run by a palace manager (\"Schlossleiter\").\n\nThe supervisory body for the state firm is the governing board (\"Verwaltungsrat\"). Its main task is the oversight of the business leadership and support to the manager.\n\n"}

Published by Harvard Business School Press, it was listed as a \"Top 10 Business Book\" by Amazon.com and translated into 18 different languages. The book is the basis for \"The Medici Effect,\" a term coined by Johansson and used throughout various industries to describe innovation that happens when disciplines and ideas intersect.\n\nIn the book, Johansson argues that innovation comes from diverse industries, cultures, and disciplines when they all intersect, bringing ideas from one field into another. He also recommends assembling diverse teams of people to collaborate on innovation.\n\nThe name of the book is derived from the Medici Dynasty, an Italian banking family that came to power in the 14th century. The family's wealth was able to support artists that led to The Renaissance. The book looks at examples of how Renaissance painters, sculptors, poets, philanthropists, scientists, philosophers, financiers, and architects, shaped historical eras of innovation. The Medici family did not intend the Renaissance, but contributed to it with what Johansson coins as the \"Medici Effect.\"\n\nThe book became the foundation for the \"Medici Effect\", a term that describes contributions of disruptive innovation from people who have no experience in an industry. An example from the book includes Charles Darwin being a geologist and collecting a number of bird species from the Galápagos Islands. Darwin kept poor notes of his collection and returned the birds and notes over to John Gould upon his return. Gould was an expert ornithologist and initially dismissed the birds as being normal. Gould later discovered that each species was in fact distinct. The example from the book shows how Darwin, without the knowledge of ornithology, could contribute to the field without having the training or knowledge.\n\n\"BusinessWeek\" called \"The Medici Effect\" \"one of the best books on innovation.\" It was described as a \"work of art\" by \"Entrepreneur\". \"The Washington Post\" said that Johansson has \"written a book dozens of business school professors meant to write, but couldn't.\" Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen stated that The Medici Effect is \"One of the most insightful books on innovation I have ever read.\" The book became a best-seller and was listed as a \"Top 10 Business Book\" by Amazon.com. It was also translated into 18 different languages.\n\nBased on the success of the book, Johansson founded The Medici Group, a consultancy firm that promotes innovation through diversity. He has appeared on national media and in publications that include \"Black Enterprise\", Diversity Executive, \"Anderson Cooper 360°\", and CNBC's The Business of Innovation.\n\nThe book was released in 2004 by Harvard Business School Press. The first edition of the book was called \"The Medici Effect: Breakthrough Insights at the Intersection of Ideas, Concepts, and Cultures\". \n\nIn 2006 the book was republished in paperback and Kindle format with the title \"The Medici Effect: What Elephants and Epidemics Can Teach Us About Innovation\".\n\nOn March 7, 2017 an updated edition was published in hardcover, paperback and Kindle format with the title \"The Medici Effect, With a New Preface and Discussion Guide: What Elephants and Epidemics Can Teach Us About Innovation\".\n\n"}

Murray served as the chief executive of the Irish Goods Council during the 1970s and 1980s, when it launched the \"Buy Irish\" and \"Guaranteed Irish\" marketing campaigns.\n\nMurray's first job was at local Irish post office in Clonmel following his graduation from high school. His other earlier occupations included positions at both Kelly and Shiel and Remington Rand.\nMurray also became the chairman of both An Post and Bord Iascaigh Mhara later in his career.\n\nMurray was born on 22 July 1932, in Clonmel, County Tipperary to parents, Jeremiah Murray and Mai Lynch Murray. He was one of six children in his family. Murray attended the Christian Brothers High School in his native Clonmel.\n\nHe married Nancy Clear and was father to John Murray, an Irish business journalist and broadcaster for the RTÉ business division and a \"Morning Ireland\" presenter. Vivian and Nancy had six children during their marriage.\n\nMurray's career began to take off when he was appointed general manager at the Irish National Development Association. The organisation would later be renamed the Irish Goods Council and was funded by the Irish government. Under Murray, the Irish Goods Council would be known as a champion of Irish products, sold both domestically and abroad.\n\nHe became widely known for his launch of the \"Guaranteed Irish\" and \"Buy Irish\" marketing and advertising campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s, which were aimed at Irish consumers. Murray's \"Buy Irish\" was based on his own beliefs that quality was more important in Irish products than merely purchasing an item because it was made in Ireland. He also believed that the Buy Irish campaign, as it came to be called, should focus on the Irish consumer market. Murray also felt that low quality products should not be supported by the \"Buy Irish\" campaign.\nMurray felt that free trade was important, but did not want the \"Buy Irish\" campaign to heavily emphasise exports, which he believed was detrimental to the domestic Irish manufacturing and consumer markets. However, he was also strongly against any intrusion by Irish protectionists into the marketing campaign. Th campaign was credited with saving thousands of domestic manufacturing jobs, especially for younger people. He explained his goals for the Irish Goods Council and its \"Buy Irish\" campaign in 1980 saying, \"What the Irish Goods Council does is to create the selling environment, develop new patterns of consumer desire, build up goodwill and favourable attitudes. These attitudes must then be exploited by the manufacturer.\" Murray's success at the Irish Goods Council was widely noted. He and his colleagues at the Council were praised by then Senator Mary Harney during a 1980 political debate. However, success ended during the 1980s. The \"Guaranteed Irish\" promotional campaign was founded to be in violation of the European Union's Treaty of Rome. As a result, the Irish government soon cut its state funding for the campaign. Murray left the Irish Goods Council in 1989. However, he was still named the Small Firms' Association Business Person of the Year in 1989, the same year he left the Irish Goods Council.\n\nMurray simultaneously appointed the chairman of the Bord Iascaigh Mhara in 1981 while still heading the Irish Goods Council. He stayed on as chairman of Bord Iascaigh Mhara for two terms.\n\nHe next became the chairman of An Post in 1990 following his departure from the Irish Goods Council and was credited with returning the Irish postal system to profitability during his tenure. Murray also joined the Gray-Murray consulting firm, which is now known as Indecon.\n\nVivian Murray fully retired from the business world during the middle of the 1990s. However, he continued to remain active in other causes and foundations. For example, he collaborated closely with Roman Catholic Father James McDyer in Glencolumcille, County Donegal, to establish projects to promote Irish culture.\nHe was appointed to the board of trustees of the Louvain Institute for Ireland in Europe. The Louvain Institute, which was created to promote Ireland and its cultural heritage in the European Union, is headquartered at the Irish College in Leuven, Belgium. Murray was later awarded a fellowship by the institute.\n\nMurray's had other very wide ranging life accomplishments and community involvements. He was appointed as a member of the first Independent Radio and Television Commission. Murray served as a former director of the former LSB College, which has since become part of the Dublin Business School. He was also an active member of the Priory Institute, which is part of the St Mary's Dominican Priory in Tallaght, County Dublin.\n\nVivian Murray died in Dublin on 6 March 2008, at the age of 76 after a long illness. Murray was survived by his wife, Nancy (née Clear), and six children – daughters Mary, Anne, Bernie and Madeleine and sons, Dermot and John.\n"}
