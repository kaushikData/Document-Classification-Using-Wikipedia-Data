The player takes the role of Administrator of NASA or head of the Soviet space program with the ultimate goal of being the first side to conduct a successful manned moon landing. It was developed by Strategic Visions and published by Interplay Productions as a computer version of \"LIFTOFF!\", a 1989 board game developed by Fritz Bronner. \"BARIS\" was re-released in 1994 on CD-ROM, incorporating the earlier updates to the floppy disk version, a few new updates, improved video of the mission launches, and new multiplayer modes.\n\nThe developers worked to maintain historical accuracy, including all the actual major space hardware and several alternative proposals that were considered at the time, but did make some compromises and simplifications in the name of game balance and avoiding complexity. They also consulted Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who gave permission for his name to be used for the game.\n\n\"Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space\" has two sides, the United States and the Soviet Union, unlike \"LIFTOFF!\" which supported up to four (the other two sides in \"Liftoff!\" were Europe and Asia). Each player controls a space center, which doubles as a navigational menu, and directs funding toward purchasing hardware, research and development, recruiting and training astronauts, and conducting launches.\n\nWhile the ultimate goal of the game is to conduct a successful manned Moon landing, it is necessary to complete several milestone achievements to ensure success. Historical milestones in the game range from launching a satellite, like Sputnik 1, to conducting a lunar orbital mission, like Apollo 8. Skipping a milestone results in a safety penalty to any mission depending on it. For example, skipping a manned lunar orbital mission would cause a safety penalty to all mission steps during a moon landing mission.\n\nPlay begins in spring of 1957 and proceeds with turns lasting six months each for up to 20 years to the end of 1977, or until the first player successfully conducts a manned Moon landing, or until one player is dismissed from his/her program (this happens rarely, and only to a human player who is essentially doing nothing). At the start of each turn, the game randomly chooses an \"event card\" to give the player, usually with a piece of historical information, and sometimes with positive or negative effects on the game. For example, the player may be informed that Operation Paperclip has increased the effect of research and development for that turn.\n\nOn the way to the Moon landing, the two space programs compete for prestige in order to secure funding. Players gain prestige points through space exploration \"firsts\", which include historical milestone missions that improve lunar mission safety, but also ancillary achievements, such as the first Mars flyby (historically Mariner 4) or first woman in space (historically Valentina Tereshkova). The player to make the second successful mission of a certain type will typically gain some prestige points, whereas subsequent missions may earn very few or no points. Prestige points are lost through mission failures, especially those involving astronaut/cosmonaut fatalities.\n\nThe heart of the game is the space missions, which come down to dice rolls. At each step of a mission, the safety factor of the relevant component is checked against a random number, adjusted by relevant astronaut skill bonuses (if the mission is manned), safety penalties and other factors. If the check fails, an error occurs. Such an error may range from catastrophic mission failure down to no effect (e.g. \"The first imprint in the lunar surface is in fact made by a helmet visor. Crewman okay.\"). Placing a satellite in orbit has three steps, while a moon landing can have well over twenty. Missions are generally non-interactive; occasionally during an incident, the player may be given the option of aborting or proceeding.\n\nWhile developing \"LIFTOFF!\" with Task Force Games, Fritz Bronner had considered making a computer version, but did not find much interest within Task Force. As Task Force had not optioned the \"LIFTOFF!\" computer game when they were contractually able, Bronner decided to undertake the development independently. In November 1990 he met and recruited then 22-year-old Michael McCarty as programmer and formed Strategic Visions as a partnership, but concluded that publishing would be too daunting a task. They initially decided to program for Amiga and released a videotape demo on that platform in June 1991. However, by September they concluded that the Amiga market was shrinking and decided to change platforms to IBM PC compatible.\n\nIn August 1991, Strategic Visions signed with Interplay Entertainment to publish the game, with a projected release of May 1992. By this time, Buzz Aldrin was on the project in an advisory role. It was also around this time that Bronner added the feature of astronaut/cosmonaut skills and morale, which previously made no impact on the performance of a mission. Astronaut/cosmonaut skills were initially randomized at the start of each game.\n\nStrategic Visions and Interplay showed a demo of \"Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space\" at the 1992 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, and also held a reception at Caesars Palace where Buzz Aldrin spoke about his experiences in the space program.\n\nSoftware testing began in September 1992, which proved a daunting task: one tester calculated that with all mission types and hardware permutations factored in, there were over 12,000 possible missions. With failure modes factored in, this number increased to approximately 50 million possible mission outcomes.\n\nIn January 1993, the manual was the last major step delaying shipping. It took 2.5 weeks to design and another 6 weeks before it came back from the printers.\n\nIn March 1993, \"Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space\" was ready to be released after a production which had lasted 28 months.\nThe final floppy disk version had some 100 megabytes of photographs and animations cut due to space limitations, and the then-planned modem play was cut as well. Immediately upon completion of the floppy version, however, work began on the CD-ROM version. The CD-ROM version was produced by Interplay's Rusty Buchert, who also produced \"Descent\".\n\"BARIS\" was re-released in 1994 on CD-ROM, incorporating the earlier updates to the floppy disk version, a few new updates, improved video of the mission launches, and new multiplayer modes.\n\nIn 2005, after the bankruptcy of publisher Interplay the developers released the game's source code under a GPL license and the game's content as freeware. The resulting project, now called \"Race Into Space\", is hosted on Sourceforge. The game has now been ported to modern operating systems and additional platforms (for instance Pandora), with some improvements over the original. Development at SourceForge has ceased, and is continuing, slowly, now on GitHub.\n\nIn October 2013, Slitherine Strategies released the first version of a game titled \"Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager\". The game focuses on research, development and mission planning, and shares many features with the original BARIS, but is much more detailed.\n\nWhile Interplay and others had billed the game upon its release as being appropriate for children as young as age 10, it drew criticism for being extremely difficult. It was also criticized by \"The Guardian\" as being \"rather lifeless\". \"Computer Gaming World\" was more positive, wishing for a CD-ROM version but stating that it was a \"game that should appeal to anyone with even a casual interest in space exploration\".\n\nThe game received a 90/100 score from \"PC Gamer UK\", was a finalist for the \"COMPUTE!\" Choice Awards in 1993. In 1994, \"PC Gamer UK\" named \"Race Into Space\" the 26th best computer game of all time. The editors called it \"the most successful piece of 'educational' software available for the PC\".\n\nIt has remained popular enough with fans to spawn an open-source version from the original developers at Strategic Visions in 2005, which was downloaded from Sourceforge between 2005 and 2017 over 90,000 times. Some of the improvements mentioned above have made the game less difficult.\n\nWhile Strategic Visions worked to accurately simulate space launches and the act of running either space program, they made a number of simplifications for balancing as well as for the game to make sense. For example, four NASA launch facilities are condensed into one superfacility. More significant is the elimination of some minor rocket programs, such as Redstone, and the addition of docking capability to the Voskhod spacecraft. There is also a \"basic\" model in the game which equalizes costs and safety factors between both sides. Despite this, \"BARIS\" still features most of the major pieces of hardware and approaches to Moon landing that were considered, including lunar orbit rendezvous (which was the strategy used successfully in Project Apollo), Earth orbit rendezvous and direct ascent.\n\n"}

This means that \"because the companies essentially control each other, no outside shareholder is strong enough to name board members\".\n\nIn 2006, he and his family were targeted by the Seoul Supreme Prosecutor's Office as part of an investigation into embezzling 100 billion won ($106 million) from Hyundai to create slush funds to bribe officials.\nDespite a travel ban, Chung left South Korea in April 2006.

The precise form of the constitutional documents depends upon the type of entity.\n\nBy convention, most common law jurisdictions divide the constitutional documents of companies into two separate documents:\n\nIn many countries, only the primary document is filed, and the secondary document remains private. In other countries, both documents are filed.\n\nIn civil law jurisdictions, the company's constitution is normally consolidated into a single document, often called the charter.\n\nIt is quite common for members of a company to supplement the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as \"shareholders' agreements\", whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way. Conceptually a shareholders' agreement fulfills many of the same functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to it somehow. One benefit of shareholders' agreement is that they will usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders' agreements to be publicly filed.\n\nAnother common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of \"voting trusts\", although these are relatively uncommon outside of the United States and certain offshore jurisdictions.\n\nPartnerships also have constitutional documents in the form of a partnership agreement. In some jurisdictions, a more formal constitution, sometimes referred to as articles of partnership or a partnership deed is used (particularly where the partnership has certain corporate aspects, such as a Limited Liability Partnership). However, many partnerships are not created formally, and may have no written partnership agreement and leave the regulation of the partnership to be regulated in accordance with the understandings of the parties and by general law. Some of the largest partnerships in the world have no written partnership agreement.\n\nA trust is not a separate legal entity as such, but is often treated as one for certain legal purposes. Like partnerships, trusts are not normally required to have a written trust instrument to constitute them, although most large and formal trusts do.\n\nAn unincorporated association may also have a constitution which provides for the rights and remedies of the members as between themselves, and governs the conduct of the association. Because, in most legal systems, unincorporated associations do not have separate legal personality, this aspect of the constitutional documents is not applicable. In most legal systems unincorporated associations are not required to have formal written constitutions, but many of the larger and more complex organisations would be almost impossible to administer without one.\n"}

{"id": "20194178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20194178", "title": "Deinking", "text": "Deinking\n\nDeinking is the industrial process of removing printing ink from paperfibers of recycled paper to make deinked pulp.\n\nThe key in the deinking process is the ability to detach ink from the fibers. This is achieved by a combination of mechanical action and chemical means. In Europe the most common process is froth flotation deinking.\n\nPaper is one of the main targets for recycling. A concern about recycling wood pulp paper is that the fibers are degraded with each cycle and after being recycled 4–6 times the fibers become too short and weak to be useful in making paper.\n\nBefore the invention of the paper machine in 1799 the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, hence the name rag paper. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was independent of recycled materials.\n\nRecycling of used paper before the industrialisation of paper production, rag paper was recycled to make low-grade board. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. He practiced together with German paper producer Johann Engelhard Schmid. Today this method is called deinking.\n\nFirst in the 1950s and 1960s the use of recycled fibres from paper made of wood pulp begun to increase, and was mainly used in packaging paper and paperboard. In the 1950s the froth flotation technique was adapted for deinking recycled paper. Use of recovered paper increased in the 1970s mainly in graphic and hygienic papers, and accelerated in the 1980s. The annual growth in use of recovered paper increased by 6% between 1980 and 1996. The use of virgin fibres only increased 2% in the same period. In 1997 recovered paper production was 42% of the total paper production.\n\nWaste paper may contain a mixture of different paper types made of mixtures of different paperfibers. These must be sorted before processed. Broke (paper waste from paper production) is normally used directly in the papermachine.\nRecycled paper can be used to make paper of the same or lower quality than it was originally. The sorted paper is baled and shipped to a papermill. The pulpmill uses waste paper grade according to the paper quality they want to make.\n\nThe bales are opened and large foreign objects are sorted out on the conveyor belt to the pulper. Many extraneous materials are readily removed. Twine, strapping, etc. are removed from the hydropulper by a \"ragger\". Metal straps and staples can be screened out or removed by a magnet. Film-backed pressure-sensitive tape stays intact: the PSA adhesive and the backing are both removed together.\n\nPulpers are either batch, which uses a tub with a high shear rotor, or continuous, using a long, perforated drum. Drum pulpers are very expensive but have the advantage of not breaking up contaminants, thus giving cleaner end product.\n\nThe pulper chops the paper to smaller pieces; water and chemicals are added. Normally the pH is adjusted to 8.5 - 10.0. Normal deinking chemicals are: \nAfter pulping, the mixture is a slurry. The slurry goes to screening.\n\nCentrifugal cleaning is spinning the pulp slurry in a cleaner, causing materials that are denser than pulp fibers to move outward and be rejected. Screens, with either slots or holes, are used to remove contaminants that are larger than pulp fibers.\n\nMaterials which are more difficult to remove include wax coatings on corrugated cartons and stickies, soft rubbery particles which can make deposits and contaminate the recycled paper. Stickies can originate from book bindings, hot melt adhesives, PSA adhesives from paper labels, laminating adhesives of reinforced gummed tapes, etc.\n\nIn the deinking stage the goal is to release and remove the hydrophobic contaminants from the recycled paper. The contaminants are mostly printing ink and stickies. Several processes are used, most commonly flotation or washing.\n\nFroth flotation was adapted from the flotation process used in the mining industry in the 1960s. It is the most common deinking process in Europe used to recover recycled paper. Often most of the collector is added to the inlet of the flotation. The process temperatures are normally in the range 45 - 55 °C. Air is blown into the pulp suspension. The collector has affinity both to the ink particles and air bubbles, causing them to attach. The air bubbles lift the ink to the surface and form a thick froth that can be removed. Normally the setup is a two stage system with 3, 4 or 5 flotation cells in series. Flotation deinking is very effective in removing ink particles larger than about 10 µm.\n\nWash deinking consists of a washing stage where dispersants are added to wash out the printing inks. When the pulp slurry is dewatered (thickened), the medium to fine particles are washed out. This process is most useful for removing particles smaller than about 30 µm, like water-based inks, fillers, coating particles, fines and micro stickies. This process is more common when making deinked pulp for tissue. The processing equipment are belt filters, pressure belt filters, disk filters and static filters. This stage is much more efficient than normal washing / dewatering stages.\n\nHigh quality deinking of office wastes and other printing papers often commonly uses a combination of washing and flotation.\n\nThis method of deinking uses industrial or food grade enzymes in conjunction with flotation deinking to aid in the removal of inks in recycling mills. More efficient removal of ink increases fiber yield, decreases dirt count, and increases paper brightness. Often the use of enzymatic deinking helps mills reduce their bleach usage or use cheaper furnish.\n\nDissolved air flotation (DAF) is used by some mills in the deinking stage and will remove some ink and filler (ash); however, it is mainly used to clarify the process water.\n\nWashing / dewatering (thickening) is a filtration process. Small particles (< 5 µm) are removed by passing water through the pulp.\n\nIf white paper is desired, bleaching uses peroxides or hydrosulfites to increase the brightness of the pulp. The bleaching methods are similar for mechanical pulp, but the goal is to make the fiber brighter.\n\nThe deinked fiber is made into a new paper product in the same way that virgin wood fiber, see papermaking.\n\nThe unusable material left over, mainly ink, plastics, filler and short fibers, is called sludge. The sludge is buried in a landfill, burned to create energy at the paper mill or used as a fertilizer by local farmers.\n\nWater based flexographic printing inks with particle sizes below 5 µm and poor solubility in alkaline conditions may cause problems in deinking, especially in the flotation stage. The solution is to use an extra acidic washing stage.\n\nTemperature control is important as this affects the stickiness of stickies.\n\nAdditional issues arise when taking into account the number of chemicals potentially present in paper for recycling. Studies have indicated that paper might contain as many as 10,000 different chemicals, fate of which in the deinking process still remains unknown.\n\n"}
{"id": "24457470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24457470", "title": "Domingo Matheu", "text": "Domingo Matheu\n\nDomingo Bartolomé Francisco Matheu (4 August 1765, in Barcelona, Spain – 28 March 1831, in Buenos Aires, Argentina) was a Spanish-born Argentine businessman and politician. He was a member of the Primera Junta, the first national government of modern Argentina, and the second president in the end of the Junta Grande from August to September 1811.\n\nDomingo Bartolomé Francisco Matheu was born in August 4, 1765, in Mataró. His parents were Juan Pablo José Benito Matheu Ros and Antonia Xicola. He studied in the school \"Pías\" of Mataró, and then focused in math and naval studies. He became a pilot, and visited other Spanish territories as La Habana, Philippines and the Canary Islands. He moved to Buenos Aires in 1791, and opposed the trade regulations of the time. He sought both economic and political support among the local society.\n\nMatheu joined the Regiment of Miñones during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. He was appointed lieutenant of the second company, under the command of Juan Larrea. On August 19, 1806, a few days after the liberation of Buenos Aires from British rule, Matheu, Larrea and other neighbours requested authorization to create a new military unit, \"Urbanos Voluntarios de Cataluña\". Viceroy Santiago de Liniers approved it on September 26. As Larrea got ill, Matheu led this unit during the second British attack in 1807. He retired from the combats in Miserere, and waged urban warfare from the buildings of the city. He was awarded by a Real Order in January 1809 for his role in the defense of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe Peninsular War in Spain, along with the capture of the king Ferdinand VII and the fall of the Junta of Seville, escalated political disputes in Buenos Aires that led to the May Revolution. Several criollos thought that the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, appointed by the fallen Junta, did not have legitimacy, and requested an open cabildo to discuss it. Azcuénaga attended it, and voted for the creation of a Junta with deputies from all the provinces, with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum. However, the majority agreed with the creation of a junta, but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling during in the meantime. The viceroy tried to stay in government as president of the Junta, which was resisted by the criollos. The reasons of Matheu's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists, Alzaguists, the military and the clergy.\n\nThe May Revolution began the Argentine War of Independence, which was complicated by the lack of weapons in the country. Without enough resources to buy them, the Primera Junta established armories. The first director, Juan Taragona, was soon replaced by Matheu. Working alongside German gunsmiths as Juan Frye and Fernando Lamping, he directed the creation of several muskets and some pieces of artillery. The armory of Buenos Aires, located at the site of the modern Palace of Justice, had only 90 employees, including seven slaves and seven natives. They had limited technical knowledge, but managed to build and repair nearly three hundred muskets and a hundred of carbines. Matheu gave financial support to the armory with his own wealth. Eduard Holmberg was appointed director in 1813, replacing Matheu, but Matheu kept working for the armory anyway. He supervised as well the armory of the Tucumán Province. He directed later the manufacture of military uniforms.\n\nAfter the departure of Cisneros following the May Revolution he was designated vocal of the Primera Junta. The Primera Junta became the Junta Grande afterwards, and Matheu was designated its president when Cornelio Saavedra left it to join the battles in the north. Matheu and Larrea supported the national government with the money they obtained from commerce.\n\nHe retired from political life in 1817, staying just in commercial activities until his death in 1831.\n\nDomingo Matheu led the first armory of Argentina. General Manuel Nicolás Savio organized the construction of an arsenal in Rosario, Santa Fe, named after Matheu. The cornerstone was placed on October 3, 1942, and worked for many decades. The place was used as a detention center during the Dirty War in the 1970s.\n\n\n"}

Blake\n\nErnest Edgar 'Ernie' Blake (1879–1961) was a pioneering exhibitor of motion pictures, Chairman of Kodak UK and responsible for all Kodak cine film sales in Britain, Europe and most of the British Empire for over twenty years.\n\nBlake was born in Bedford in 1879, the son of William Blake who had moved to Bedford to manage a photographic business, and Annie Blake, a talented photographer. When he left Bedford Modern School in 1895 'his form master reportedly told him that he was a lazy, talkative, brainless youth who will never be any good'.\n\nBlake followed his brother Bill into their father's business and 'the brothers worked together as lanternists for lecturers and lime-light operators for theatrical productions and concert parties'.\n\nAnnie Blake encouraged Blake and his brother to take up cinematography which had been pioneered in London and Paris in the late 1880s. From 1897 the Blake brothers 'developed a travelling picture show using first their own animatograph and then a gas-illuminated projector which they used to transport around Bedfordshire villages using a pony and trap'. He was showing motion pictures to audiences as early as 1897.\n\nEastman Kodak, the US film and camera company, started to set up a network of shops throughout the UK where Blake and his father were already stockists. In 1903, Blake joined Kodak Ltd. as a demonstrator and salesman.\n\nIn 1911, Blake became general manager of the Kodak cinematographic film department. When called to service during World War I, Blake was mainly commissioned in the RAF to work on aerial photographic duties.\n\nAfter the war, Blake became European and Overseas manager for Kodak. By that time, motion picture film had become a major source of revenue for Kodak and Blake visited film studios around the world. In 1946, Blake was made Chairman of Kodak UK overseeing a major expansion of the company in the UK and Europe; he became semi-retired at age 75 but remained a consultant and did not finally resign his directorship until he was 80.\n\nThe Blake brothers were founder members of the Cinema Veterans’ Association in 1924 and both were later presidents. Blake played a prominent part in the Kinematograph Manufacturers' Association and the British Kinematograph Society and the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. He later became a member of the Cinema Consultative Committee.\n\nBlake, who had a continuing interest in Bedfordshire cricket, played water polo in his early years and would be closely associated with rugby throughout his life, being President of Bedford RUFC from 1938 until his death. Blake died in Bedford in 1961 and was survived by his wife Louise and only son George Sidney William Blake.\n\nBlake, 'a cheerful and forceful pioneer in photography' and 'one of the most influential men in the world's film industry,' was widely known as 'a colourful personality...a rugged and earthy character given to strong views and prejudices', famous for his after-dinner speeches with stories from the film business; he was said to be able to mix with anybody. His funeral was attended by Lord Morrison of Lambeth, then chairman of the British Board of Film Censors, and many others from the worlds of photography, cinematography and sport.\n"}
{"id": "17565669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17565669", "title": "Edward E. Ayer", "text": "Edward E. Ayer\n\nEdward Everett Ayer (November 16, 1841 – May 3, 1927) was an American business magnate, best remembered for the endowments of his substantial collections of books and original manuscripts from Native American and colonial-era history and ethnology, which were donated to the Newberry Library and Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Ayer had over time built an immense fortune out of supplying timber to the 19th century's fast-growing railroad industry. However, it was a chance encounter in his youth with a book that inspired Ayer's lifelong investments of time and money that resulted one of the largest collections of historical and American literature accumulated by the early 20th century. That book was William H. Prescott's famous \"History of the Conquest of Mexico\", which Ayer first read in a small library attached to a silver mine south of Tucson Ayer had been guarding as part of his military service. By his own account, he was indelibly marked by what he read and it became the foundation for his insatiable interest in Indian Americana literature.\n\nUntil 1836, the Ayer family had remained in Massachusetts since arriving from England two hundred years earlier. Like the colonizers who first came to the New World, Edward's father Elbridge Gerry Ayer was drawn to the adventure and economic possibilities on the frontier, and moved to Southport (modern-day Kenosha, Wisconsin) where Edward was born in 1841. His older sister Mary was possibly \"the first white child born\" there. A military road established by Congress turned Southport into an increasingly significant trade route. Ayer's father opened a general store, contracted a blacksmith, and even dabbled in grain brokering. He sold his enterprise to buy land five miles south where a train station was to be built. There he had the fortune to participate in the planning of the town of Harvard, Illinois. His efforts led to limited railroad construction contracts. Young Edward was educated at the first school built in Harvard, where he recalls \"books were very scarce ... I virtually never saw any but the Bible and Josephus' works.\"\n\nIn 1860 at the age of nineteen, Ayer headed west to Silver City, Nevada where he found employment at a quartz mine. With money saved from this hard labour Ayer was able to move to San Francisco, where he stayed with family friends and got a job at a saw mill, gaining his first experiences in the industry which would later make his fortune.\n\nAs California entered the American Civil War Ayer enlisted in the First California Cavalry Volunteers in August 1861, spending several years in the American southwest on military service. During this time, Ayer was stationed guarding the Cerro Colorado silver mine near the Mexican border. The mine had been supplied with a small library by its owners (donated by Colonel Samuel Colt, of Colt revolver fame), and it was here that Ayer came across a volume of Prescott's \"History of the Conquest of Mexico\". At roughly twenty years old, this was the first library Ayer had ever seen, and upon reading \"Conquest of Mexico\" he describes the experience as one that \"seemed to open up an absolutely new world to me\".\n\nAyer returned to Harvard, Illinois at the conclusion of his service in 1864, where he received a third share in his father's general store. Within a month, Ayer was in Chicago on business where he happened past a bookseller and negotiated to purchase Prescott's full five-volume set on the conquests of Mexico and Peru. He recalls that day in his memoir:\n\nI feel that that day, taking those books home, was, perhaps, the happiest day of my life up to that time; and going home I only touched the earth in high places. And I want to reiterate that the finding of Prescott's \"Conquest of Mexico\" in that mine in Arizona in '62, has been responsible and is to be credited as the principal force that has given me a vast amount of enjoyment in this world, and is absolutely responsible for the \"Ayer Collection\" in the Newberry Library, Chicago.\n\nAyer's nephew was the noted artist Elbridge Ayer Burbank, most renowned for his many paintings of Native American personages.\n\nEdward Ayer went on to amass an enormous collection of books and manuscripts on American history as it pertained to the North American Indian (inclusive of Central America). Ayer was a charter Trustee of Chicago's Newberry Library when it incorporated in 1892. In 1897, he determined to donate his roughly 50,000 pieces to the library, but because of the enormity of the undertaking, this took until 1911 to complete. As of 1941, three major holographs have been discovered in the collection: Bernardino de Sahagún's Latin-Spanish-Nahua dictionary, Father Junípero Serra's 1769 diary, and Father Francisco Ximénez' bicolumnar transcription-translation of the K'iche' Maya oral tradition (today known as \"Popol Vuh\".).\n\nAyer was also an early benefactor of the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), instrumental in its foundation and serving as its first president. The FMNH arose from the collections assembled for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, as the curator in charge of the collections F.W. Putnam sought to establish a permanent exhibition of the materials. As one of the museum's incorporators, Ayer set to work establishing an endowment fund, and approached the retail magnate Marshall Field (after whom the museum was later named) for contributions. Field was initially reluctant, reportedly declaring \"I don't know anything about a museum, and I don't care to know anything about a museum\". However Ayer was eventually able to persuade Field to relent, supposedly through admonishing Field with \"You can sell dry goods until hell freezes over, but in 25 years, you will be absolutely forgotten.\" Field contributed one million dollars towards the establishment, and a further eight million was bequeathed to the museum from Field's estate upon his death.\n\nAyer himself led in the expansion of the museum's library, in 1894 donating 400 of his own volumes on ornithology and a further 600 he had bought from the collection of Charles Cory. Ayer continued to expand to the museum library holdings with further purchases of natural history collections in ichthyology and other topics, and donations from his own acquisitions. By 1926 in the year before his death the Ayer Collection at FMNH was one of the most extensive and foremost of its type in the world.\n\n"}

The center of population of West Virginia is located approximately north of Gassaway.\n\nThe town was originally created at the ends of two divisions of the Coal and Coke Railway, one originating in Charleston and the other originating in Elkins. Because of its central location, the area was an ideal place to build shops to facilitate the transition between the relatively flat Charleston division, which could operate with standard equipment, and the more hilly Elkins division of the Coal & Coke which required heavier engines. The town was laid out in 1904, and over the next decade, businesses and infrastructure such as hotels, a bank, stores, schools, a hospital, office buildings and churches appeared to serve the growing population.

Programmers implement instrumentation in the form of code instructions that monitor specific components in a system (for example, instructions may output logging information to appear on the screen). When an application contains instrumentation code, it can be managed by using a management tool. Instrumentation is necessary to review the performance of the application. Instrumentation approaches can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation.\n\nIn programming, instrumentation means the ability of an application to incorporate:\n\n\nInstrumentation is limited by execution coverage. If the program never reaches a particular point of execution, then instrumentation at that point collects no data. For instance, if a word processor application is instrumented, but the user never activates the print feature, then the instrumentation can say nothing about the routines which are used exclusively by the printing feature.\n\nSome types of instrumentation may cause a dramatic increase in execution time. This may limit the application of instrumentation to debugging contexts.\n\n\n"}

His father, a merchant in timber, had moved to Aachen, Liège and Heinsberg after converting to the Reformed Church. Not much is known about Jean's early life, he did not have children, and he never married. \n\nJean eventually settled in Rouen, where there was religious freedom under Henry IV of France. He was naturalized in 1601. He developed trade and ship owner activities and from 1609 until 1616 he was deeply involved in the salt trade from Hiers-Brouage, along with his Dordrecht-based brother Dirck. In 1620 they commissioned a ship-of-war, to be built in Amsterdam for Charles, Duke of Guise. By 1621 he was appointed chamberlain to Louis XIII. In the 1620s he was involved in arms trading for Charles Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers. In 1628 he was allowed to collect taxes. In the 1630s he became a banker. \nHoeufft repeatedly advanced funds to the King, and took part in major financial deals. In 1634 Hoeufft participated in peace talks between the Dutch and Spain, in which also Jules Mazarin and Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange were involved. Hoeufft played a key part in diplomatic negotiations, despite having no official authority to do so. His appointment as Commissioner of the States General of the Netherlands was formalized in 1637. In 1639 his house in Rouen was sacked; it is likely he moved to La Rochelle or Paris. In 1643 he obtained the fief Fontaine-le-Comte, a former lake near Sacy-le-Grand. \n\nHoeufft became treasurer and Secretary to Louis XIV of France, holding those roles until his death in 1651.\n\nAt the time of the Thirty Year's War, arms dealing was a highly lucrative business in Europe. Hoeufft, described by a contemporary as “‘a man capable of speaking and acting’ as well as ‘[having] money to distribute to people should there be need,’” was well-suited to the job. Hoeufft delt with Axel Oxenstierna, Johan Adler Salvius, Hugo Grotius, Abraham de Wicquefort and Adriaen Pauw on the French support for the Swedish army; the money had to be allocated to the Amsterdam Wisselbank.\n\nIn finance, he was Cardinal Richelieu's banker for remitting subsidies during the Thirty Years War, and banker to the Dukes of Saxe-Weimar.\n\nHoeufft occupied a prominent place in the network of political interests that bound together France’s structure of alliances during the Thirty Years War. \"In some sense, his political interests were so tightly interwoven with his financial and mercantile interests that they are difficult to disentangle.\"\n\nThe Hoeufft family invested over a million livres in reclamation of lakes and swamps in Picardie, Poitou and other parts of France, which for the most part were carried out between 1642 and 1653 by Dutch engineers such as .\n\nIn 1650, Hoeufft was the director of the operation to drain the Poitou Marsh in western France. From the 1640s, one of his associates was David de la Croix, who seems to have married Hoeufft's niece, Marguerite Hoeufft. When Hoeufft died, de la Croix was among his beneficiaries and also took over the Poitou marsh operation.\n\nFrédéric Otto Fabrice de Gressenich, Councillor and Maître d'hotel du Roi, the son of Jean's sister Anne, inherited the Sacy marshes along with his Hœufft cousins. As the only cousin living in France, he administered the lands on their behalf.\n\nHoeufft died in Paris on 5 September 1651. He had two brothers and five sisters who scattered to Cologne, Dordrecht, London, and Utrecht. \n\nHoeufft bequeathed two million livres to the poor of the Reformed Church of Charenton.\n\nIn 1736 Hoeufft's property at Petit Poitou was sold at Luçon in the Poitevin.\n\n"}
{"id": "105978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=105978", "title": "John Ericsson", "text": "John Ericsson\n\nJohn Ericsson (born Johan) (July 31, 1803 – March 8, 1889) was a Swedish-American inventor, active in England and the United States, and regarded as one of the most influential mechanical engineers ever. Ericsson collaborated on the design of the steam locomotive \"Novelty\", which competed in the Rainhill Trials on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, won by George Stephenson's \"Rocket\". In America he designed the US Navy's first screw-propelled steam-frigate , in partnership with Captain Robert Stockton, who unjustly blamed him for a fatal accident. A new partnership with Cornelius H. DeLamater of the DeLamater Iron Works in New York resulted in the first armoured ship with a rotating turret, , which dramatically saved the US naval blockading squadron from destruction by an ironclad Confederate vessel, , at Hampton Roads in March 1862.\n\nJohan Ericsson was born at Långban in Värmland, Sweden. He was the brother of Nils Ericson, a distinguished canal and railway builder in Sweden. Their father Olaf Ericsson (1778–1818) had worked as the supervisor for a mine in Värmland. He had lost money in speculation and had to move his family to Forsvik in 1810. There he worked as a director of blastings during the excavation of the Swedish Göta Canal.\n\nThe extraordinary skills of the two Ericsson brothers were discovered by Baltzar von Platen, the architect of the Göta Canal. They were dubbed 'cadets of mechanics' of the Swedish Royal Navy, and engaged as trainees at the canal enterprise. At the age of fourteen, John was already working independently as a surveyor. His assistant had to carry a footstool for him to reach the instruments during surveying work.\nAt the age of seventeen he joined the Swedish army in Jämtland, serving in the Jämtland Ranger Regiment, as a Second Lieutenant, but was soon promoted to Lieutenant. He was sent to northern Sweden to do surveying, and in his spare time he constructed a heat engine which used the fumes from the fire instead of steam as a propellant. His skill and interest in mechanics made him resign from the army and move to England in 1826. However his heat engine was not a success, as his prototype was designed to burn birchwood and would not work well with coal (the main fuel used in England).\n\nNotwithstanding the disappointment, he invented several other mechanisms instead based on steam, improving the heating process by incorporating bellows to increase oxygen supply to the fire bed. In 1829 he and John Braithwaite built \"Novelty\" for the Rainhill Trials arranged by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. It was widely praised but suffered recurring boiler problems, and the competition was won by English engineers George and Robert Stephenson with \"Rocket\".\n\nTwo further engines were built by Braithwaite and Ericsson, named \"William IV\" and \"Queen Adelaide\" after the new king and queen. These were generally larger and more robust than \"Novelty\" and differed in several details (for example it is thought that a different design of blower was used which was an 'Induced Draught' type, sucking the gases from the fire). The pair ran trials on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway but the railway declined to purchase the new designs.\n\nTheir innovative steam fire engine proved an outstanding technical success by helping to quell the memorable Argyll Rooms fire on February 5, 1830 (where it worked for five hours when the other engines were frozen up), but was met with resistance from London's established 'Fire Laddies' and municipal authorities. An engine Braithwaite and Ericsson constructed for Sir John Ross's 1829 Arctic expedition failed and was dumped on the shores of Prince Regent Inlet. At this stage of Ercisson's career the most successful and enduring of his inventions was the surface condenser, which allowed a steamer to recover fresh water for its boilers while at sea. His 'deep sea lead,' a pressure-activated fathometer was another minor, but enduring success. The commercial failure and development costs of some of the machines devised and built by Ericsson during this period put him into debtors' prison for an interval. At this time he also married 19-year-old Amelia Byam, a disastrous match that ended in the couple's separation until Amelia's death.\n\nHis only formal education was a basic officer's education and training during his time in the Swedish Army. On March 27, 1822, John passed a surveyor's examination in Stockholm. As a child he was taught to be a miner and surveyor by his father.\n\nHe then improved ship design with two screw-propellers moving in different directions (as opposed to earlier tests with this technology, which used a single screw). However, the Admiralty disapproved of the invention, which led to the fortunate contact with the encouraging American captain Robert Stockton who had Ericsson design a propeller steamer for him and invited him to bring his invention to the United States of America, as it would supposedly be more welcomed in that place. As a result, Ericsson moved to New York in 1839. Stockton's plan was for Ericsson to oversee the development of a new class of frigate with Stockton using his considerable political connections to grease the wheels. Finally, after the succession to the Presidency by John Tyler, funds were allocated for a new design. Unfortunately they only received funding for a 700-ton sloop instead of a frigate. The sloop eventually became , named after Stockton's hometown.\n\nThe ship took about three years to complete and was perhaps the most advanced warship of its time. In addition to twin screw propellers, it was originally designed to mount a 12-inch muzzle-loading gun on a revolving pedestal. The gun had also been designed by Ericsson and used hoop construction to pre-tension the breech, adding to its strength and allowing safe use of a larger charge. Other innovations on the ship design included a collapsible funnel and an improved recoil system.\n\nThe relations between Ericsson and Stockton had grown tense over time and, approaching the completion of the ship, Stockton began working to force Ericsson out of the project. Stockton carefully avoided letting outsiders know that Ericsson was the primary inventor. Stockton attempted to claim as much credit for himself as possible, even designing a second gun to be mounted in \"Princeton\". Unfortunately, not understanding the design of the first gun (originally named \"The Orator\", renamed \"The Oregon\" by Stockton), the second gun was fatally flawed.\n\nWhen launched, \"Princeton\" was an enormous success. On October 20, 1843, she won a speed trial against the paddle steamer , until then considered the fastest steamer afloat. Unfortunately, during a firing demonstration of Stockton's gun, the breech ruptured, killing Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas Walker Gilmer, as well as six others. Stockton attempted to deflect the blame onto Ericsson, with moderate success, despite the fact Ericsson's gun was sound and it was Stockton's gun that had failed. Stockton also refused to pay Ericsson, and by using his political connections, Stockton blocked the Navy from paying him. These actions led to Ericsson's later deep resentment toward the U.S. Navy.\n\nWhen Ericsson arrived from England and settled in New York, he was persuaded by Samuel Risley of Greenwich Village to give his work to the Phoenix Foundry. There he met Cornelius H. DeLamater and soon a mutual attachment developed between the two, and rarely thereafter did Ericsson or DeLamater enter upon a business venture without first consulting the other.\" Personally, their friendship never faltered, though strained by the pressures of business and Ericsson's quick temper, DeLamater called Ericsson \"John\" and Ericsson called DeLamater by his middle nickname \"Harry\", intimacies almost unknown in Ericsson's other relationships. In time, the DeLamater Iron Works became known as the Asylum where Capt Ericsson had free rein to experiment and attempt new feats. The Iron Witch was next constructed, the first iron steamboat. The first hot-air invention of Capt Ericsson was first introduced in the ship \"Ericsson\", built entirely by DeLamater. The DeLamater Iron Works also launched the first submarine boat, first self-propelled torpedo, and first torpedo boat. When DeLamater died on February 2, 1889, Ericsson could not be consoled. Ericsson's death one month later was not surprising to his close friends and acquaintances.\"\n\nEricsson then proceeded to invent independently the caloric, or hot air, engine in the 1820s which used hot air, caloric in the scientific parlance of the day, instead of steam as a propellant. A similar device had been patented in 1816 by the Reverend Robert Stirling, whose technical priority of invention provides the usual term 'Stirling Engine' for the device. Ericsson's engine was not initially successful due to the differences in combustion temperatures between Swedish wood and British coal. In spite of his setbacks, Ericsson was awarded the Rumford Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1862 for his invention. \n\nIn 1830 Ericsson patents his second engine, that can work either with steam, air or water. This rotative engine objective is to reduce the engine within more convenient limits without any corresponding loss of power.\n\nIn 1833 Ericsson build his third engine, a hot air engine (or caloric engine) that is exhibited in London : \"the engine will prove the most important mechanical invention ever conceived by the human mind, and one that will confer greater benefits on civilized life than any that has ever preceded it\" (John O. Sargent). This engine includes a regenerator that will inspire many other hot air engine inventors.\n\nThe caloric ship, the 4th Ericsson engine, will be built in 1852. \nA group of New York merchants and financiers headed by John B Kitching, Edward Dunham, President of the Corn Exchange Bank, and G.B. Lamar, president of the Bank of the Republic, backed the project and in April, 1852, the keel of the ship was laid at the yard of Perine, Patterson, and Stack in Williamsburgh. At about the same time the construction of the engine was commenced by Messrs Hogg and Delamater. \nHull and machinery were built in the greatest possible secrecy, both Ericsson and his financial backers being convinced that their ship would revolutionize ocean transport by its economy and safety, and that competitors would if possible copy the design of at least the engine. \nOn September 15, 1852, the ship was launched and in November the engine was turned over at the dock under its own power. It will be a failure.\nSmaller experimental engines based on the same patent design and built before the caloric ship will prove to be working efficiently.\n\nIn his later years, the caloric engine would render Ericsson comfortably wealthy, as its boilerless design made it a much safer and more practical means of power for small industry than steam engines. Ericsson's incorporation of a 'regenerator' heat sink for his engine made it tremendously fuel-efficient. Apparently in the post Civil War era some time before or around 1882, from the publishing date, a ship was purchased by a Captain Charles L. Dingley called the \"Ericsson\" with a weight of 1,645 tons that was built by John Ericsson (Although the above section on John Ericsson's Friendship with Cornelius H. DeLamater says that the ship known as the \"Ericsson\" was built by the DeLamater Iron Works) to try out the hot air engine as a motive power in open ocean navigation.\n\nIn 1883 John Ericsson built a solar air engine of 1 HP. The leading feature of the sun motor is that of concentrating the radiant heat by means of a rectangular trough having a curved bottom lined on the inside with polished plates, so arranged that they reflect the sun’s rays toward a cylindrical heater placed longitudinally above the trough. \nThis heater, it is scarcely necessary to state, contains the acting medium, steam or air, employed to transfer the solar energy to the motor; the transfer being effected by means of cylinders provided' with pistons and valves resembling those of motive engines of the ordinary type. Practical engineers, as well as scientists, have demonstrated that solar energy cannot be rendered available for producing motive power, in consequence of the feebleness of solar radiation.\n\nOn September 26, 1854, Ericsson presented Napoleon III of France with drawings of iron-clad armored battle ships with a dome-shaped gun tower, and even though the French emperor praised this particular plan of an invention, he did nothing to bring it to practical application. In 1851 he designed the Caloric ship Ericsson.\nShortly after the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the Confederacy began constructing an ironclad ram upon the hull of which had been partially burned and then sunk by Federal troops before it was captured by forces loyal to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Nearly concurrently, the United States Congress had recommended in August 1861 that armored ships be built for the American Navy. Ericsson still had a dislike for the U.S. Navy, but he was nevertheless convinced by Lincoln's hard-working Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, and Cornelius Scranton Bushnell to submit an ironclad ship design to them. Ericsson later presented drawings of , a novel design of armored ship which included a rotating turret housing a pair of large cannons. Despite controversy over the unique design, based on Swedish lumber rafts, the keel was eventually laid down and the ironclad was launched on March 6, 1862. The ship went from plans to launch in approximately 100 days, an amazing achievement.\n\nOn March 8, the former USS \"Merrimack\", rechristened , was wreaking havoc on the wooden Union Blockading Squadron in Virginia, sinking and . \"Monitor\" appeared the next day, initiating the first battle between ironclad warships on March 9, 1862, at Hampton Roads, Virginia. The battle ended in a tactical stalemate between the two ironclad warships, neither of which appeared capable of sinking the other, but strategically saved the remaining Union fleet from defeat. After this, numerous monitors were built for the Union, including twin turret versions, and contributed greatly to the naval victory of the Union over the rebellious states. Despite their low draft and subsequent problems in navigating in high seas, many basic design elements of the \"Monitor\" class were copied in future warships by other designers and navies. The rotating turret in particular is considered one of the greatest technological advances in naval history, still found on warships today.\n\nLater Ericsson designed other naval vessels and weapons, including a type of torpedo and a destroyer, a torpedo boat that could fire a cannon from an underwater port. He also provided some technical support for John Philip Holland in his early submarine experiments. In the book \"Contributions to the Centennial Exhibition\" (1877, reprinted 1976) he presented his \"sun engines\", which collected solar heat for a hot air engine. One of these designs earned Ericsson additional income after being converted to work as a methane gas engine.\n\nEricsson died on March 8, 1889, the anniversary of the Battle of Hampton Roads, in which his \"Monitor\" famously played a central role.\n\nHis wish to be buried in his native land sparked a series of articles from New York Times alleging that, by selecting the third-rate to transport his remains, the US Navy was not paying proper respect to Ericsson. The Navy responded and sent the remains on the , escorted by other ships such as . On August 23, 1890, the fleet departed with a twenty-one gun salute and the Swedish flag set at half mast. Around 100,000 people turned out for the funeral procession and departure ceremonies, including several veterans of the USS \"Monitor\". Upon arrival in Stockholm, Sweden, the fleet was under presidential order to shoot a twenty-one gun salute to the Swedish flag, leave the remains, and immediately return to sea.\n\nHis final resting place is at Filipstad, in Värmland.\n\nAlthough none of his inventions created any large industries, he is regarded as one of the most influential mechanical engineers ever and without a doubt the best naval engineer in America in the 19th century.\n\n\n\nThe stamp commemorating John Ericsson on April 20, 1926, coincided with the unveiling of the Ericsson Memorial in West Potomac Park, Washington, DC directly south of the Lincoln Memorial. The stamp pictures the memorial design by J. H. Frazer. The seated figure of Ericsson has the figures above and behind him of Vision, Labor and Adventure.\n\nMonuments in honor of John Ericsson have been erected at:\n\nShips named in his honor:\n\nOrganizations:\n\nEricsson is a major character in Harry Harrison's novels of alternate history, the \"Stars and Stripes trilogy\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16019354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16019354", "title": "Jurisdictional arbitrage", "text": "Jurisdictional arbitrage\n\nJurisdictional arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of the discrepancies between competing legal jurisdictions. It takes its name from arbitrage, the practice in finance of purchasing a good at a lower price in one market and selling it at a higher price in another. Just as in financial arbitrage, the attractiveness of jurisdiction arbitrage depends largely on its transaction costs, here the costs of switching legal service providers from one government to another.\n\nThe lower the exit costs for leaving the jurisdiction (unrestricted emigration, cheap travel, liquidity of assets) the more desirable and feasible it is. Conversely, high entry costs into the more favourable jurisdiction are an inhibitor on jurisdictional arbitrage; certain tax havens such as Andorra grant permanent residency rights to immigrants only if they meet certain criteria. Jurisdictional arbitrage is a significant concept in modern free market anarcho-capitalism, not to be confused with anarchism per se.\n\nThe practice of individuals seeking asylum involves appealing to a jurisdiction with favorable individual rights for residency, where the individual's native jurisdiction is seen to offer insufficient protection. For example, women have fled West African nations which practice tribal female genital mutilation and/or extremist Islam in favour of European and North American jurisdictions.\n\nTo avoid arbitrary restrictions on skilled immigration, high-tech companies may set up offices in countries neighboring those with the restrictive policies, preferably in locations close to the border, as was the case with Microsoft's plans to open a satellite office in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, situated only 140 miles (225 km) from its headquarters in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, Washington in the United States. In Silicon Valley, a project is underway to launch a ship 12 nautical miles from the shore, in international waters, with the goal of allowing entrepreneurs without US work visas to legally create and work for companies close to the area (see Blueseed).\n\nOn the other hand, jurisdictional arbitrage has also been utilized to hinder attempts at governmental prosecution, by transnational criminals such as terrorists, money launderers, and cyber-attackers.\n\nPrior to recent international mobilization against the practice, there existed a long-standing tradition of ousted state leaders such as Erich Honecker, Idi Amin and Augusto Pinochet finding refuge and retirement abroad to avoid prosecution in their native jurisdiction. Pinochet, one-time military leader of Chile sought to evade retributive prosecution in his native jurisdiction by seeking refuge in the United Kingdom. He was later prosecuted by a Spanish court according to the principle of universal jurisdiction.\n\nTo counteract this phenomenon, most countries have signed bilateral extradition treaties with most other countries, and some governments adopted the principle of universal jurisdiction, which has enabled individuals to be prosecuted for offences (particularly alleged human rights violations and war crimes) committed outside the jurisdiction of prosecution – the legal structure of nations such as Belgium and Spain allow for this, as does that of international tribunals operating under the aegis of the United Nations.\n\nA similar attempt at governmental collusion to limit the use of jurisdictional arbitrage for tax avoidance is the policy of tax harmonization. The membership of European governments in the European Union resulted in a collection of nations with a limited set of common legal structures (Four Freedoms) which has resulted in tax competition by the otherwise less-developed nations (such as the Republic of Ireland in the early 1990s) whereby governments compete for foreign investment by lowering their tax rates significantly below those of their neighbours. This strategy has been adopted in the form of a flat tax by various Eastern European nations, which has resulted in calls for harmonization of tax rates by the traditionally more developed nations such as France, Britain and Germany.\n\nAnarcho-capitalists hope that by subdividing existing governmental jurisdictions into city-states (such as Singapore), competition among jurisdictions for citizens will lead to a diversity of legal climates including more favourable jurisdictions for liberty and self-determination. Cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists also cite low exit costs and fluidity of movement across jurisdictions as a significant means of advancing individual freedom through the free movement of information and capital. The concept of seasteading is an attempt to increase the possibility of jurisdictional arbitrage by decreasing the cost of switching governments. It is worth noting that there is nothing anarchist about jurisdictional arbitrage, since it is a strategy based on profiting from the differences between regulatory regimes, and therefore incompatible with the abolition of the state.\n\nA notable proponent and practitioner of jurisdictional arbitrage is Canadian businessman and perpetual traveler Calvin Ayre, founder of online gambling consortium Bodog Entertainment Group. Although online gambling is illegal in the United States, a market which accounts for 95% of Bodog's sales, the company pays no corporate taxes there as its activities are distributed across different jurisdictions to minimise tax burden. \"We run a business that can't actually be described as gambling in each country we operate in. But when you add it all together, it’s Internet gambling.\"\n\n"}

During his lifetime, he served as executive officer of various government and private companies in the country. He was appointed the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Industry from 1969-1970 and then Chairman of the Development Bank of the Philippines from 1970 till his death in 1976. He hailed from the city of Imus in Cavite province.\n\nLeonides Sarao Virata was born on April 22, 1918 in Brgy. Medicion II, Imus, Cavite to Luis Virata and Agapita Sarao. According to family members, the original family name was Bautista. Sometime during the 1896 Philippine revolution, a forebear changed the surname to Virata, taking the name of the character King Virata from the Indian epic \"Mahabharata\". His elder half-brother, Dr. Enrique Topacio Virata (who married Leonor Aguinaldo, daughter of Gen. Baldomero Aguinaldo) was the father of Cesar Virata, the former Prime Minister of the Philippines. Virata was also a relative of Leonardo S. Sarao, an automotive designer and founder of Sarao Motors, the maker of jeepneys known internationally as a symbol of Filipino culture.\n\nVirata obtained his Law degree in 1940 and Business Administration degree, \"cum laude\", in 1941, both courses from the University of the Philippines. He did graduate work at the Harvard University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University.\n\nVirata was in the United States when the Philippine Commonwealth was evacuated to America because of the raging war in the Pacific. From 1946 to 1948, he worked as an officer of the Philippine Embassy in the US. After the war, the task of directing the economic research of the newly organized Central Bank of the Philippines in 1949 fell on him. Subsequently, he was appointed as the bank’s deputy governor and later, as a member of the Monetary Board. In various United Nations conferences on finance, trade, industry and economics; Virata served in different capacities. He was the adviser to the Philippine delegate to the International Monetary Fund Conference at Washington, DC in 1949 and to the International Monetary Fund and International Bank Conference at Paris, France in 1950. He was a delegate of the Philippines to the Conference of the Consultative Committee in Economic Development in Southeast Asia under the Colombo plan in Ceylon in 1957.\n\nIn 1952, he left the government service and joined the Philippine American Life and General Insurance Company as financial vice-president and vice-chairman of its investment committee. Soon, he was accorded the same respect he earned during his service with the government. He was elected either as chairman, president or board member of various companies involved in insurance, food processing, marketing, oil exploration, plywood manufacture, logging, textile, meat packing, glass making, oil refining, banking, telecommunications, etc. His leadership in business and industry reached its peak when he was elected president of the Philippine Chamber of Industries and the Management Association of the Philippines. He was also attributed to the successful transfer of the Manila Electric Company to Filipino control from General Public Utilities of the United States, and the Filipinization of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.\n\nHe became a member of the Joint Legislative Executive Tax Commission in 1966. From 1969 to 1970, President Marcos appointed him as Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Industry (now the Department of Trade and Industry). In 1970, he was appointed chairman of the Development Bank of the Philippines. Upon assuming his position as Chairman of DBP, he ordered the investigation of several major firms that failed to pay the DBP millions of pesos in overdue obligations. Because of this, he was considered as one of the radical chairmen the DBP ever had. Also as head of the DBP, he helped agricultural and industrial enterprises through sound financing schemes. He was also responsible for orienting the institutional objective of development to the countryside to insure that the rural people would enjoy the benefits of economic growth.\n\nOn July 14, 1976, Chairman Virata died in Houston, Texas, where he was treated of a lingering illness, leaving his wife the former Marie Theresa “Bebe”\nGallardo Lammoglia, and two children, Luis Juan Virata (married Elizabeth Torres Cu-Unjieng) and Giovanna “Vanna” Virata.\n\nJV de Ocampo assumed Virata’s unfinished term at the DBP. In honoring Virata, Chairman de Ocampo said: “In the death of Chairman Leonides Virata, we have lost a\nesteemed leader in the country’s economic life. He was a force in our development direction…. Chairman Virata was an articulate exponent of an economic strategy\ndesigned to improve the quality of life of our people and he gave of himself liberally to this pursuits toward the end. Shortly before his death, he sought to give deeper and massive meaning to the DBP’s countryside development program which he himself initiated in line with national policy.”\n\n"}

{"id": "1924106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1924106", "title": "Monopoly Tycoon", "text": "Monopoly Tycoon\n\nMonopoly Tycoon is a construction and management simulation PC game published in 2001. The player operates a business that owns stores and apartments in a city derived from the Monopoly board game. Instead of using dice, the game relies more on the speed and innovativeness of the players. In the standard mode, the user plays against the AI opponents. In the multiplayer version, players go against other online players in order to gain victory.\n\nThere are various levels with varying difficulty. Some involve just financial prosperity of the businesses while others involve success in the political arena. But the primary objective of most levels is to accumulate the most wealth in the given time.\n\nIn \"Monopoly Tycoon\", the player operates a business by owning businesses, apartments, and being landlord to blocks. The player earns income from selling products and services, housing people in apartments and hotels. Income is also generated from rent for any blocks that the player is landlord of, plus utilities and railroads.\n\n\"Monopoly Tycoon\" has the same set of blocks as the board game with an additional three. When a player is landlord of all blocks of the same color, they are able to build hotels. In addition, being landlord of any property allows the player to build park space.\n\nAs in the board game, there are railroads and utilities blocks that players can become landlord of and receive income from. To become landlord, there is an auction among the players with the property going to the highest bidder.\n\nAt the end of the day, the player is offered a mystery card similar to those from the board game. Some of the cards are a simple deposit or withdrawal of money from the player's account. Other cards allow the player to aid his businesses or harm the opponent, say by restocking one of his stores or giving an opponent block bad publicity.\n\nMonopoly Tycoon also includes support for multiplayer game play over a LAN or Internet connection. Additionally, there is support for finding live online opponents through the included GameSpy Arcade software.\n\nThe music of the game is lighthearted and changes as the game progresses through the different decades. For example, in the 1970s (1970 and 1975 Monopoly Tycoon years), music from the 1970s can be heard; in 1990 and 1995, 1990s music plays. This music will play until the year 2030 is reached (this year can only be reached in the \"My Mega Metropolis\" level, \"Starting Out\", \"A Homely City\", \"Sell, Sell, Sell\", and the \"First to be Worth $20,000, $25,000, or $40,000\" levels). At that point, music from the 1930s can be heard from then on.\n\nAfter every two days at midnight, the music from the previous decade becomes quieter and quickly fades away, while the music from the next decade starts at normal volume. For example, when midnight of 1960 occurs, the music from the 1950s fades away and the music from the 1960s plays at normal volume.\n\nOther sounds indicate the time of day. People, cars, and the wind all make noises, in varying degrees depending on the time of day. For example, during the morning, footsteps of people waking up and coming out of their apartments is played to signify the time the city wakes up. Throughout the game, also, the sound of coins falling can be heard when the player makes money.\n\n\"Monopoly Tycoon\" was a commercial success, selling nearly 2 million copies by 2006. Lead designer Clive Robert explained that these sales \"took years\" to achieve, and that the game continued to sell as of 2006, after its release in September 2001. In the United States, \"Monopoly Tycoon\" sold 290,000 copies and earned $6.8 million by August 2006. \"Edge\" ranked it as the 66th best-selling computer game released in the country between January 2000 and August 2006.\n\n\"Monopoly Tycoon\" received generally positive reviews from critics. It received a 'great' score of 8.5/10 from GameSpot and a 'great' score from IGN of 8.2/10. Trey Walker at GameSpot said that \"Monopoly Tycoon is the kind of game you might have imagined as a kid while you played the real board game.\"\n\nThe developers of the game, however, were critical of their work saying that \"I don’t think we got it entirely right either.\"\n\nThe Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated \"Monopoly Tycoon\" for its 2001 \"Online Game Play of the Year\" and \"Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering\" awards, which ultimately went to \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\" and \"Grand Theft Auto III\", respectively. \"Monopoly Tycoon\" was also a nominee for \"Computer Gaming World\"s 2001 \"Best Strategy Game\" award, although it lost to \"\". The editors presented \"Monopoly Tycoon\" with a special prize for the \"Best Use of a License That Was Ignored\", and wrote, \"Blessed with great AI and gameplay, \"Monopoly Tycoon\" was probably the most pleasant surprise of the year.\"\n\n"}

Each shipment tendered to a major parcel carrier like UPS and FedEx come with service guarantees outlined within each carrier's tariff or service guide. An increasing number of businesses contract third-party companies to perform these services because they have the technology necessary to automate the otherwise time consuming process.\n\nParcel carriers like UPS, FedEx, and DHL often have large, long, and complicated invoices. A customer shipping a high volume of parcel boxes via one of these carriers sees invoices hundreds of pages long. The invoices show a high amount of visibility to how a package was carried and delivered. This finite data is collected by UPS and FedEx for tracking purposes and to automate the process of charging the appropriate amount to their clients.\n\nThe invoicing process is so automated that mistakes happen often. Insiders to UPS and FedEx claim that little focus is spent to prevent billing for inappropriate charges: duplicate charges, incorrect discount amounts, and phantom accessorial charges. Invoicing errors are a common phenomenon, and most large carriers provide teams and electronic forms to contest improper charges on invoices. With the proper data to dispute the charges, they are often credited in a matter of hours.\n\nOverbilling - or service failures - is a larger problem than invoicing errors. A service failure occurs when a package with a time-sensitive guarantee is delivered late and a refund is due to the client. Most carriers like UPS and FedEx place the responsibility on the customer to check the timeliness of the delivered package. Once the service failure is found, the carrier typically credits the amount due quickly. The terms and conditions for claiming a late package are stated and the act of claiming a refund is also time-sensitive.\n\nUp to 5% of a clients UPS and/or FedEx charges are due to errors or overbilled items. This results in around $2 billion of unclaimed refunds.\n\nCustomers forward their electronic billing file or approve their carriers to send the electronic billing files directly to the auditor. Most auditors accept all forms of electronic billing files. Customers may request these files from their carriers.\n\nThe parcel auditing industry, otherwise knows as small package audit, has been growing in popularity. Most auditors operate using a performance-based model.\n"}
{"id": "440125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440125", "title": "Post-Fordism", "text": "Post-Fordism\n\nPost-Fordism is the dominant system of economic production, consumption, and associated socio-economic phenomena in most industrialized countries since the late 20th century. It is contrasted with Fordism, the system formulated in Henry Ford's automotive factories, in which workers work on a production line, performing specialized tasks repetitively, and in which his workers could afford the products they built. Definitions of the nature and scope of post-Fordism vary considerably and are a matter of debate among scholars. Changes in the nature of the workforce include the shift of emphasis to new information technologies and the rise of the service and the white-collar worker.\n\nPost-Fordism is characterized by the following attributes:\n\nPost-Fordism can be applied in a wider context to describe a whole system of modern social processes. Because post-Fordism describes the world as it is today, various thinkers have different views of its form and implications. As the theory continues to evolve, it is commonly divided into three schools of thought: the Regulation School, Flexible Specialization, and Neo-Schumpeterianism.\n\nThe Regulation approach (also called the neo-Marxist or French Regulation School), was designed to address the paradox of how capitalism has both a tendency towards crisis, change and instability as well as an ability to stabilize institutions, rules and norms. The theory is based on two key concepts. \"Regimes of Accumulation\" refer to systems of production and consumption, such as Fordism and post-Fordism. \"Modes of Regulation\" refer to the written and unwritten laws of society which control the Regime of Accumulation and determine its form.\n\nAccording to Regulation theory, every Regime of Accumulation will reach a crisis point at which the Mode of Regulation will no longer support it, and society will be forced to find new rules and norms, forming a new Mode of Regulation. This will begin a new Regime of Accumulation, which will eventually reach a crisis, and so forth. Proponents of Regulation theory include Michel Aglietta, Robert Boyer, Bob Jessop, and Alain Lipietz.\n\nProponents of the flexible Specialization approach (also known as the neo-Smithian approach) to post-Fordism believe that fundamental changes in the international economy, especially in the early 1970s, forced firms to switch from mass production to a new tactic known as Flexible Specialization. Factors such as the oil shocks of 1973, increased competition from foreign markets (especially Southeast Asia) due to globalization, the end of the post-World War II boom, and increasing privatization made the old system of mass-producing identical, cheap goods through division of labor uncompetitive.\n\nInstead of producing generic goods, firms now found it more profitable to produce diverse product lines targeted at different groups of consumers, appealing to their sense of taste and fashion. Instead of investing huge amounts of money on the mass production of a single product, firms now needed to build intelligent systems of labor and machines that were flexible and could quickly respond to the whims of the market. The technology originally associated with flexible production was the numerical control technology, which was developed in the United States in the 1950s; however, the CNC, developed in Japan, later replaced it. The development of the computer was very important to the technology of flexible specialization. Not only could the computer change characteristics of the goods being produced, but it could also analyze data to order supplies and produce goods in accordance with current demand. These types of technology made adjustments simple and inexpensive, making smaller specialized production runs economically feasible. Flexibility and skill in the labor was also important. The workforce was now divided into a skill-flexible core and a time-flexible periphery. Flexibility and variety in the skills and knowledge of the core workers and the machines used for production allowed for the specialized production of goods. Modern just in time manufacturing is one example of a flexible approach to production.\n\nLikewise, the production structure began to change on the sector level. Instead of a single firm manning the assembly line from raw materials to finished product, the production process became fragmented as individual firms specialized on their areas of expertise. As evidence for this theory of specialization, proponents claim that Marshallian \"industrial districts,\" or clusters of integrated firms, have developed in places like Silicon Valley, Jutland, Småland, and several parts of Italy.\n\nThe Neo-Schumpeterian approach to post-Fordism is based upon the theory of Kondratiev waves (also known as long waves). The theory holds that a \"techno-economic paradigm\" (Perez) characterizes each long wave. Fordism was the techno-economic paradigm of the fourth Kondratiev wave, and post-Fordism is thus the techno-economic paradigm of the fifth, which is dominated by information and communication technology.\n\nNotable Neo-Schumpeterian thinkers comprise Carlota Perez and Christopher Freeman, as well as Michael Storper and Richard Walker.\n\nIn Italy, post-Fordism has been theorised by the long wave of workerism or autonomia. Major thinkers of this tendency include the Swiss-Italian economist , Antonio Negri, Paolo Virno, Carlo Vercellone, Maurizio Lazzarato. Marazzi's \"Capital and Language\" takes as its starting point the fact that the extreme volatility of financial markets is generally attributed to the discrepancy between the \"real economy\" (that of material goods produced and sold) and the more speculative monetary-financial economy. But this distinction has long ceased to apply in the post-Fordist New Economy, in which both spheres are structurally affected by language and communication. In \"Capital and Language\" Marazzi argues that the changes in financial markets and the transformation of labor into immaterial labor (that is, its reliance on abstract knowledge, general intellect, and social cooperation) are two sides of a new development paradigm: financialization through and thanks to the rise of the new economy.\n\nIn terms of the development of the 'technical and political class-composition', in the post-Fordist era the crisis explains at the same time 'high points of the capitalist development' and how new technological tools develop and work altogether (money form, linguistic conventions, capital and language). [Zanini, A. 2010, 'On the Philosophical Foundations of Italian Workerism: A Conceptual Approach', Historical Materialism, 18, 4: 39-63.]\n\nPost-Fordism brought on new ways of looking at consumption and production. The saturation of key markets brought on a turn against mass consumption and a pursuit of higher living standards. This shift brought a change in how the market was viewed from a production standpoint. Rather than being viewed as a mass market to be served by mass production, the consumers began to be viewed as different groups pursuing different goals who could be better served with small batches of specialized goods Mass markets became less important while markets for luxury, custom, or positional good became more significant. Production became less homogeneous and standardized and more diverse and differentiated as organizations and economies of scale were replaced with organizations and economies of scope.\n\nThe changes in production with the shift from Fordism to post-Fordism were accompanied by changes in the economy, politics, and prominent ideologies. In the economic realm, post-Fordism brought the decline of regulation and production by the nation-state and the rise of global markets and corporations. Mass marketing was replaced by flexible specialization, and organizations began to emphasize communication more than command. The workforce changed with an increase in internal marketing, franchising, and subcontracting and a rise in part-time, temp, self-employed, and home workers. Politically, class-based political parties declined and social movements based on region, gender, or race increased. Mass unions began to vanish and were instead replaced by localized plant-based bargaining. Cultural and ideological changes included the rise in individualist modes of thought and behavior and a culture of entrepreneurialism. Following the shift in production and acknowledging the need for more knowledge-based workers, education became less standardized and more specialized. Prominent ideologies that arose included fragmentation and pluralism in values, post-modern eclecticism, and populist approaches to culture.\n\nOne of the primary examples of specialized post-Fordist production took place in a region known as the Third Italy. The First Italy included the areas of large-scale mass production, such as Turin, Milan, and Genoa, and the Second Italy described the undeveloped South. The Third Italy, however, was where clusters of small firms and workshops developed in the 1970s and 1980s in the central and northeast regions of the country. Regions of the Third Italy included Tuscany, Umbria, Marche, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli, and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. Each region specialized in a range of loosely related products and each workshop usually had five to fifty workers and often less than ten. The range of products in each region reflected the post-Fordist shift to economies of scope. Additionally, these workshops were known for producing high quality products and employing highly skilled, well-paid workers. The workshops were very design-oriented and multidisciplinary, involving collaboration between entrepreneurs, designers, engineers and workers.\n\nThere were several post-World War II changes in production in Japan that caused post-Fordist conditions to develop. First, there were changes to company structure, including the replacement of independent trade unions with pro-management, company-based unions; the development of a core of permanent male multi-skilled workers; and the development of a periphery of untrained temporary and part-time employees, who were mostly female. Second, after World War II, Japan was somewhat isolated because of import barriers and foreign investment restrictions, and as a result, Japan began to experiment with production techniques. Third, as imported technologies became more available, Japan began to replicate, absorb, and improve them, with many improvements deriving from modifications for local conditions. Fourth, Japan began to concentrate on the need for small-batch production and quick changeover of product lines to serve the demand for a wide range of products in a relatively small market. Because of informal price-fixing, competition was based not on price but rather on product differentiation. As a result, production became less standardized and more specialized, particularly across different companies. Fifth, Japan began to build long-term supply and subcontracting networks, which contrasted with the vertically integrated, Fordist American corporations. Sixth, because small and medium-size manufacturers produced a wide range of products, there was a need for affordable multipurpose equipment as opposed to the specialized, costly production machinery in Fordist industries in the United States. Technology for flexible production was significant in Japan and particularly necessary for smaller producers. The smaller producers also found it necessary to reduce costs. As a result, Japan became one of the main users of robots and CNC. Over time, these six changes in production in Japan were institutionalized.\n\nThe main criticism of post-Fordism asserts that post-Fordism mistakes the nature of the Fordist revolution and that Fordism was not in crisis, but was simply evolving and will continue to evolve. Other critics believe that post-Fordism does exist, but coexists with Fordism. The automobile industry has combined Fordist and post-Fordist strategies, using both mass production and flexible specialization. Ford introduced flexibility into mass production, so that Fordism could continue to evolve. Those who advocate post-Fordism, however, note that criticism that focuses primarily on flexible specialization ignores post-Fordist changes in other areas of life and that flexible specialization cannot be looked at alone when examining post-Fordism. Another criticism is that post-Fordism relies too heavily on the examples of the Third Italy and Japan. Some believe that Japan is neither Fordist nor post-Fordist and that vertical disintegration and mass production go hand in hand. Others argue that the new, smaller firms in Italy didn’t develop autonomously, but are a product of the vertical disintegration of the large Fordist firms who contracted lower value-added work to smaller enterprises. Other criticisms argue that flexible specialization is not happening on any great scale, and smaller firms have always existed alongside mass production. Another main criticism is that we are too much in the midst to judge whether or not there really is a new system of production.\n\nThe term \"post-Fordism\" is gradually giving way in the literature to a series of alternative terms such as the knowledge economy, cognitive capitalism, the cognitive-cultural economy and so on. This change of vocabulary is also associated with a number of important conceptual shifts (see sections above).\n\n\n"}

However, Sakonji was not prosecuted due to his efforts for peace at the end of the war.\n\nFollowing the occupation of Japan, in 1951 Sakonji was asked to serve on the committee towards the establishment of the modern Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "686244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=686244", "title": "Shanghaiing", "text": "Shanghaiing\n\nShanghaiing or crimping is the practice of kidnapping people to serve as sailors by coercive techniques such as trickery, intimidation, or violence. Those engaged in this form of kidnapping were known as \"crimps.\" The related term \"press gang\" refers specifically to impressment practices in Great Britain's Royal Navy.\n\nCrimps flourished in port cities like London and Liverpool in England and in San Francisco in California, Portland and Astoria in Oregon, and Seattle and Port Townsend in Washington, United States. On the West Coast of the United States, Portland eventually surpassed San Francisco for shanghaiing. On the East Coast of the United States, New York easily led the way, followed by Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore.\n\nThe role of crimps and the spread of the practice of shanghaiing resulted from a combination of laws, economic conditions, and the shortage of experienced sailors in England and on the American West Coast in the mid-19th century.\n\nFirst, once an American sailor signed on board a vessel for a voyage, it was illegal for him to leave the ship before the voyage's end. The penalty was imprisonment, the result of federal legislation enacted in 1790. (This factor was mitigated by the Maguire Act of 1895 and the White Act of 1898, and finally abolished by the Seamen's Act of 1915.)\n\nSecond, the practice was driven by a shortage of labor, particularly of skilled labor on ships on the West Coast. With crews abandoning ships en masse because of the California Gold Rush, a healthy body on board the ship was a boon.\n\nFinally, shanghaiing was made possible by the existence of boarding masters, whose job was to find crews for ships. Boarding masters were paid \"by the body,\" and thus had a strong incentive to place as many seamen on ships as possible. This pay was called \"blood money,\" and was just one of the revenue streams available. These factors set the stage for the crimp: a boarding master who uses trickery, intimidation, or violence to put a sailor on a ship.\n\nThe most straightforward method for a crimp to shanghai a sailor was to render him unconscious, forge his signature on the ship's articles, and pick up his \"blood money.\" This approach was widely used, but there were more profitable methods.\n\nIn some situations, the boarding master could receive the first two, three, or four months of wages of a man he shipped out. Sailors were able to get an advance against their pay for an upcoming voyage to allow them to purchase clothes and equipment, but the advance wasn't paid directly to the sailor because he could simply abscond with the money. Instead, those to whom money was owed could claim it directly from the ship's captain. An enterprising crimp, already dealing with a seaman, could supplement his income by supplying goods and services to the seaman at an inflated price, and collecting the debt from the sailor's captain.\n\nSome crimps made as much as $9,500 per year ().\n\nThe crimps were well positioned politically to protect their lucrative trade. The keepers of boardinghouses for sailors supplied men on election day to go from one polling place to another, \"voting early and often\" for the candidate who would vote in their interest. In San Francisco, men such as Joseph \"Frenchy\" Franklin and George Lewis, long-time crimps, were elected to the California state legislature, an ideal spot to assure that no legislation was passed that would have a negative impact on their business.\n\nSome examples included Jim \"Shanghai\" Kelly and Johnny \"Shanghai Chicken\" Devine of San Francisco, and Joseph \"Bunco\" Kelly of Portland. Stories of their ruthlessness are innumerable, and some have survived into print.\n\nAnother example of romanticized stories involves the \"birthday party\" Shanghai Kelly threw for himself, in order to attract enough victims to man a notorious sailing ship named the \"Reefer\" and two other ships.\n\nDemand for manpower to keep ships sailing to Alaska and the Klondike kept crimping a real danger into the early 20th century, but the practice was finally ended by a series of legislative reforms that spanned almost 50 years.\n\nBefore 1865, maritime labor laws primarily enforced stricter discipline onboard ships. However, after 1865, this began to change. In 1868, New York State started cracking down on sailors' boardinghouses. They declined in number from 169 in 1863 to 90 in 1872. Then in 1871, Congress passed legislation to revoke license of officers guilty of mistreating seamen.\n\nIn 1872, Congress passed the Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872 to combat crimps. Under this act, a sailor had to sign on to a ship in the presence of a federal shipping commissioner. The presence of a shipping commissioner was intended to ensure the sailor wasn't \"forcibly or unknowingly signed on by a crimp.\"\n\nIn 1884, the Dingley Act came into effect. This law prohibited the practice of seamen taking advances on wages. It also limited the making of seamen's allotments to only close relatives. However, the crimps fought back. In 1886, a loophole to the Dingley Act was created, allowing boardinghouse keepers to receive seamen's allotments.\nThe widespread adoption of steampowered vessels in the world's merchant marine services in the late 19th and early 20th centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres of canvas to be furled and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor greatly diminished (and, by extension, crimping). The sinking of the RMS Titanic, followed by onset of World War I (which made the high seas a much more dangerous place due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, Andrew Furuseth and Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. pushed through the Seamen's Act of 1915 that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.\n\nThe verb \"shanghai\" joined the lexicon with \"crimping\" and \"sailor thieves\" in the 1850s, possibly because Shanghai was a common destination of the ships with abducted crews. The term has since expanded to mean \"kidnapped\" or \"induced to do something by means of fraud.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

While the FASB has for the past forty years developed the accounting principles currently used in financial reporting in the United States, other social and environmental measures are now understood to be of relevance. The SASB aims to integrate its standards into the Form 10-K which must be filed by public companies with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; in this sense it differs from initiatives such as the GRI, by working within the current system of financial regulation. The general principle is, in Peter Drucker's phrase, \"what gets measured gets managed\".\n\nSASB appointed in 2014 former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg as Chair and former SEC Chair Mary Schapiro as Vice Chair.\n\nThe SASB aims to meet the need for industry-specific reporting standards, to ease comparison and benchmarking. In order to do so, a Sustainable Industry Classification System covering ten sectors and 80+ industries has been devised. From Q4 2012, industry-specific working groups are to convene to pursue the goal of completing the standards within two and a half years. Key performance indicators will then be updated annually.

{"id": "16264226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16264226", "title": "The Informant!", "text": "The Informant!\n\nThe Informant! is a 2009 American biographical-comedy-crime film directed by Steven Soderbergh. Written by Scott Z. Burns, the film stars Matt Damon as the titular informant named Mark Whitacre, as well as Scott Bakula, Joel McHale and Melanie Lynskey. It depicts Whitacre's involvement as a whistle blower in the lysine price-fixing conspiracy of the mid-1990s as described in the 2000 nonfiction book \"The Informant\", by journalist Kurt Eichenwald.\n\nReleased on September 18, 2009, \"The Informant!\" received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards Matt Damon's performance and the film's comedic yet ironic tone, although the latter has also been a point of derision by other critics.\n\nMark Whitacre, a rising star at the Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) office in Decatur, Illinois during the early 1990s, blows the whistle on the company’s price-fixing tactics at the urging of his wife Ginger.\n\nOne night in November 1992, Whitacre confesses to FBI special agent Brian Shepard that ADM executives—including Whitacre himself—had routinely met with competitors to fix the price of lysine, an additive used in the commercial livestock industry. Whitacre secretly gathers hundreds of hours of video and audio over several years to present to the FBI. He assists in gathering evidence by clandestinely taping the company’s activity in business meetings at various locations around the globe such as Tokyo, Paris, Mexico City, and Hong Kong, eventually collecting enough evidence of collaboration and conspiracy to warrant a raid of ADM.\n\nWhitacre’s good deed dovetails with his own major infractions, while his internal, secret struggle with bipolar disorder seems to take over his exploits. The bulk of the film focuses on Whitacre's meltdown resulting from the pressures of wearing a wire and organizing surveillance for the FBI for three years, instigated by Whitacre's reaction, in increasingly manic overlays, to various trivial magazine articles he reads. In a stunning turn of events immediately following the covert portion of the case, headlines around the world report Whitacre had embezzled $9 million from his own company during the same period of time he was secretly working with the FBI and taping his co-workers, while simultaneously aiming to be elected as ADM CEO following the arrest and conviction of the remaining upper management members. In the ensuing chaos, Whitacre appears to shift his trust and randomly destabilize his relationships with Special Agents Shepard and Herndon and numerous attorneys in the process.\n\nAuthorities at ADM begin investigating the forged papertrail Whitacre had built to cover his own deeds. After being confronted with evidence of his fraud, Whitacre's defensive claims begin to spiral out of control, including an accusation of assault and battery against Agent Shepard and the FBI, which had made a substantial move to distance their case from Whitacre entirely. Because of this major infraction and Whitacre’s bizarre behavior, he is sentenced to a prison term three times as long as that meted out to the white-collar criminals he helped to catch. In the epilogue, Agent Herndon visits Whitacre in prison as he videotapes a futile appeal to seek a presidential pardon. Overweight, balding and psychologically beaten after his years long ordeal, Whitacre is eventually released from prison, with his wife Ginger waiting to greet him.\n\nIn 2002, after completing \"Ocean's Eleven\", Soderbergh announced his intent to adapt the book \"The Informant\" by Kurt Eichenwald, a former journalist for \"The New York Times\". Scott Z. Burns wrote the script based on the book.\n\nProduction began in May, 2008 in Decatur, Illinois. Filming was also done at the former Whitacre mansion in Moweaqua, Illinois, a small town about 25 miles from Decatur, and at Illini Country Club in Springfield, Illinois. Some exterior shots were done in Mesa, Arizona, in November 2008. Other portions of the film were shot in the Coachella Valley, California. The film was released on September 18, 2009. Damon gained 20–30 pounds for the role in order to look more like Whitacre.\n\nFor the film Soderbergh cast a number of stand up comedians in prominent and supporting roles, including Andrew Daly, Joel McHale, Allan Havey, Tom Papa, Patton Oswalt, Rick Overton, Paul F. Tompkins, the Smothers Brothers and Bob Zany.\n\nThe film opened at #2 behind \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" with $10,545,000. As of December 17, 2009 the film had grossed $33,316,821 domestically and $41,771,168 worldwide.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film opened at #10 with £179,612 from the opening weekend. It was the third highest new entry after \"A Serious Man\" and \"\".\n\nThe film received generally favorable reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 79% of critics gave positive reviews based on 210 reviews with an average score of 6.8/10. Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating, reported a score of 66 out of 100 based on 37 reviews from mainstream critics.\n\nRoger Ebert awarded the film 4 stars out of 4, claiming \"\"The Informant!\" is fascinating in the way it reveals two levels of events, not always visible to each other or to the audience.\" While giving the film the grade of a B, \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted that \"Soderbergh has chosen to apply an attitude of arch whoopee, a greasy veneer of mirth over what is, no joke, a serious mess of malfeasance and mental instability,\" concluding, \"Soderbergh ultimately made the choice to abandon interesting, dispassionate empathy for the more quick-fix payoff of amusement.\" \"Rolling Stone\" gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, and, in response to critics of the film's comic tone, Peter Travers commented, \"Laugh you will at \"The Informant!,\" but it's way too real to laugh off.\" \"People\" magazine also assigned the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying, \"[Damon]'s a hoot, and so is the movie.\" Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" also praised Damon's performance, calling his interpretation of Whitacre, \"The wacky little brother of Erin Brockovich\" (whose life was also adapted by Soderbergh into a film).\n\nThe film received nominations for multiple awards, including a Satellite Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for Matt Damon as well as a nomination from the Detroit Film Critics Society. Damon was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "876353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=876353", "title": "Theme Hospital", "text": "Theme Hospital\n\nTheme Hospital is a business simulation game developed by Bullfrog Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1997 for the PC in which players design and operate a privately owned hospital with the goal of curing patients of fictitious comical ailments. The game is the thematic successor to \"Theme Park\", also produced by Bullfrog, and the second instalment in their \"Theme\" series, and part of their \"Designer Series\". The game is noted for its humour, and contains numerous references to pop culture.\n\nPeter Molyneux and James Leach came up with the idea of creating a \"Theme\" game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on \"Dungeon Keeper\". Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time pressures on the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added in a patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. \"Theme Hospital\" was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the PlayStation in 1998. A Sega Saturn version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on GOG.com in 2012 and Origin in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010. Revival attempts have been made with the development of open-source remakes such as \"CorsixTH\".\n\nThe player is required to build an environment that will attract patients with comical diseases and then treat them while tending to their needs. The game has a somewhat dark sense of humour, similar to that of its predecessor, \"Theme Park\". Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient's head), King Complex (which forces the patient to impersonate Elvis Presley), and Alien DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).\n\nStarting with an empty hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, handymen and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital at the start of each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available at the start of the game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Training room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including the amount of diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt to cover it up by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.\n\nAlthough the player has no direct control over the patients, they have some influence over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining what to do with them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.\n\nThe player competes against computer rivals named after famous computers, real and fictional: these include Holly from \"Red Dwarf\" and Deep Thought from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". The game is timed with days of the year, and at the end of each year (game time), players are judged on their performances, and may be given trophies, reputation increases, or cash bonuses.\n\nEach level has set goals in the fields of financial attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one. If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.\n\nA patch was released that fixed bugs and added support for Serial Cable, Modem, and IPX/SPX network gaming (with up to four players) in the Windows version, and a difficulty setting. In multiplayer, each player has a colour, which patients will wear to distinguish from those of other players. \"Litter Bombs\" are featured, allowing players to spread litter around other players' hospitals, while staff members can be persuaded to work for other players, and there are \"Mini Missions\", with instructions for players to perform. Players are also able to chat with each other during a game.\n\n\"Theme Hospital\" took over two years to develop. The idea came from Peter Molyneux and journalist James Leach, who explored the possibility of other \"Theme\" games while discussing \"Theme Park\". Leach suggested a hospital, and Molyneux was enthusiastic about the idea. Development began when the designer Mark Webley selected \"Theme Hospital\" from a list of possible games put together by Molyneux, and Webley, along with the artist Gary Carr, visited the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital, and Frimley Park Hospital for research and inspiration. Carr was initially displeased at the prospect of working on \"Theme Hospital\": he had previously left Bullfrog to work for The Bitmap Brothers because he did not have faith in \"Theme Park\". He chose to return based on his belief that he would work on \"Dungeon Keeper\", which he was eager to do. Initially, \"Theme Hospital\" was to feature real diseases, but these were replaced with fictional, comedic afflictions as it was decided that the game's maladies should not be too realistic: the team were faced with the dilemma of having to make the hospital fun and interesting, as Webley stated that theme parks are \"colourful\" compared to hospitals, and Carr believed that hospital rooms looked very similar and that it was hard to tell what each machine does.\n\nIt was during a hospital visit (after witnessing an operation that they were ordered out of because they were distracting the surgeon) that they came up with the idea of using made-up illnesses and cures: Carr considered death \"quite sad\" and believed that illness was not a popular subject. He stated that using made-up illnesses gave them \"creative freedom\", which he believed was essential. Webley said that Carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful. According to Carr, the team were aiming for humour rather than gore. During the initial stages of programming, Bullfrog hired James Leach, who wrote the game's text and came up with the diseases. Molyneux was not directly involved in the game's production as he was then working on \"Dungeon Keeper\".\n\nThe graphic design was decided to be modelled from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He said they did not have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.\n\nThe game deviates from the NHS model; Webley and Carr decided that players should think of the hospital as a business, with profit highly important. The team, who worked in offices near the Royal Surrey County Hospital, drew some inspirations from \"Theme Park\" and borrowed a great deal of code. Webley explained that this was an \"obvious starting point\" as he had been a programmer on \"Theme Park\", and that the systems had been rewritten by the time \"Theme Hospital\" was complete. A program which facilitated animation was built upon by Webley, who dubbed it the Complex Engine. There were not many meetings, and Webley took the team to the pub weekly with a list of tasks to perform. Webley explained that the way the team worked meant that only they could perform their assigned duties otherwise they would not get done, effectively giving members ownership of their parts of the game. It was during one such meeting that the team realised the game was complete. The disease called King Complex was to be called Elvis Impersonator, but Elvis's estate owned the rights. Bloaty Head was based on an allergic reaction Molyneux had, when his face became an \"alarming size\".\n\nAccording to Leach, the volume of work was small. A big problem was that the team had too many ideas, and insufficient time to implement them all. For example, other diseases were planned; one of these was Animal Magnetism, which would see patients with attached animals which would have to be cut away. Another idea that was not implemented was the possibility of four separate in-game eras: futuristic, mediaeval, Victorian, and modern. The game was originally to have players begin in the mediaeval zone, and progress to more modern ones. By May 1996, the idea of the other time periods had been deemed \"prohibitive\" due to the amount of graphics required. Carr later stated that the game did not need the other eras, and that the team was small enough to make things up as they went along. Carr was also afraid that if they had produced a design document, Electronic Arts would have considered the omission of the other eras feature cutting. An idea that Molyneux pushed Webley's team to implement was a screen that enabled players to mix coloured chemicals to apply them to diseases. Accessibility was also a concern for the team: with so many options, it was felt that players could treat the game like work. The tester Jon Rennie simplified the game from the original design; Webley was keen for players to be able to begin play without a long tutorial.\n\n\"Theme Hospital\" was released in March 1997 (although it was previously due for release in November 1996), and is part of Bullfrog's \"Designer Series\". The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the Houses of Parliament, and \"The Daily Telegraph\", who published an article criticising the game as \"sick\" and said that the British Medical Association was using it to train management staff. The NHS argued that the game mocked hospital management. Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game to make light of real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones. \"Theme Hospital\" was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared in the top five of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described \"Theme Hospital\" as \"a great game that I and many people remember\".\n\nOriginal releases' cover art used a green cross on a white background, which Bullfrog did not have the right to use. The artwork was mistakenly approved because it was faxed in black and white, and had to be recalled. Later releases changed the cross to a star. Despite its rejection, the cross version is available in more recent formats.\n\nThe music and sound effects were produced by Russell Shaw and Adrian Moore. Moore used Sound Forge to develop the sound effects. Some (such as the snooker balls) were taken directly from its library, and others (including the treatment machines) were created by mixing sounds together. Some machine sounds were created by mixing the sounds of electric egg mixer with that of a hydraulic lifter. The farting sounds were recorded when Moore was working with bands including T'Pau, Prefab Sprout, and Seal at a recording studio: he did so as a joke, but they were useful for \"Theme Hospital\".\n\nA PlayStation port of \"Theme Hospital\" was developed by Krisalis Software and released by Electronic Arts in 1998. The PlayStation version was released as a download on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable from PlayStation Store in Europe on 31 January 2008, in North America on 31 August 2010, and in Japan on 28 October 2009. This version is no longer available for purchase in Europe since September 2014, after becoming free for a short period of time. A Sega Saturn version (titled \"Sim Hospital\" as of October 1995) was in development and due for release in mid-1996, but was cancelled.\n\nIn 2012, \"Theme Hospital\" was re-released on the digital distribution service GOG.com. In January 2015, Origin distributed \"Theme Hospital\" free for a limited time through their \"On the House\" programme. It was distributed a second time through the \"On the House\" programme in September 2015, as a temporary replacement to \"\" due to an excessive number of requests for the latter. It was released a third time in selected countries from 7 March 2017 until 17 May 2017 as a replacement for \"Syberia 2\".\n\nAn open-source remake, \"CorsixTH\", improves the game with features such as higher screen resolutions and a level editor. \"CorsixTH\" is available under the MIT Licence, and in 2012, a version was released on Android, available on the Google Play Store.\n\n\"Theme Hospital\" received positive reviews. Critics noted the strong gameplay, detailed graphics, satisfying comedic tone, and voice acting performance, but fell conflicted on music, repetition, the artificial intelligence, and the user interface.\n\nThe British magazine \"PC Gamer\" Steve Owen praised the game's challenge and \"cute\" graphics, but criticised the interface. Frederick Claude of \"Coming Soon Magazine\" also complimented the graphics as \"highly detailed\", and the \"very simple\" user interface, although he criticised the repetitiveness and lack of multiplayer support that would later be introduced with a patch. GameSpot Trent Ward agreed about the graphics too, lauding them as \"fantastic\", and also complimented the \"realistic\" voice acting performance, and the humour, although he criticised the artificial intelligence as \"flawed\". His conclusion was that the game \"just doesn't fly\". Bonnie James of The Electric Playground also liked the graphics, as well as the \"lovely\" opening sequence, but found the music \"horrible\". \"Computer and Video Games\" Alex Huhtala concurred about the graphics, describing them as \"large and colourful\", but commented that the humour wears off after a while, although he felt it is good to begin with.\n\nAnother reviewer who liked the graphics was Dawn Jepsen of \"Computer Gaming World\", who also praised the humour, especially the \"wackiness\" of the illnesses, and described the game as \"delightful and absorbing\". The humour was also approved by a reviewer of Jeuxvideo.com, who, like other reviewers, lauded the graphics, by describing them as colourful. \"Next Generation\" reviewer echoed others' views about the humour, describing it as something they had come to except from Bullfrog, but criticised the lack of multiplayer support. The humour was again praised by a reviewer of \"PC Power\", who said that the ailments enabled Bullfrog to have \"hilarious\" cures. The \"thoroughly engrossing\" gameplay, and the graphics were also complimented: it was stated that the bright colours gave hospitals a \"cheerful look\". \"Theme Hospital\" was described as a \"fantastic title\". Other comments from critics included \"Edge\" reviewer's compliments of the balance of patients and illnesses against the player's resources, and his belief that the game is a refinement of its genre, and \"PC Zone\" reviewers commendation of the detail: it was remarked that it gets players \"helplessly immersed\", and the game was awarded the \"PC Zone\" Classic accolade. Éric Ernaux of \"\" said the quality is \"remarkable for a game of its genre\".\n\nThe PlayStation version's main problem, as noted by critics, was the controls. It was cited by reviewers from GameSpot, IGN, Eurogamer, and \"Edge\" as a major downside. Its reception was not entirely negative: James Mielke of GameSpot also commended the addictiveness, and described the port as \"almost completely intact\". IGN agreed with others about the humour, by praising it as \"wonderfully sick\". It was further commented that the game's \"brilliance\" made it a \"must-have\". The sentiments about the controls and humour were echoed by Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, who reviewed it on the PlayStation Network. Absolute PlayStation's reviewers had a mixed view about the graphics: they criticised the resolution and colour palette, but complimented the sprites. The user interface was criticised as being reminiscent of a 16-bit game. Despite the criticisms, they agreed with others about the humour, and described the game as \"a blast to play\".\n\nIn 1997, \"Theme Hospital\" appeared alongside \"Theme Park\" at #61 on \"PC Gamer\"s list of top 100 games, and was named in April as a Game of Distinction.\n\nOn 13 November 2017, Oxymoron Games revealed that they were working on \"Project Hospital\", which, according to Eurogamer, is their take on \"Theme Hospital\". On 16 January 2018, Two Point Studios, a studio founded by Webley and Carr, announced \"Two Point Hospital\", a spiritual sequel to \"Theme Hospital\". \"Two Point Hospital\" was released on 30 August 2018, and \"Project Hospital\" is due for release on 30 October 2018. \"Two Point Hospital\" features the Animal Magnetism disease, that was originally cut from \"Theme Hospital\" before release.\n\n"}
{"id": "6714969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6714969", "title": "Thomas Lee (Virginia colonist)", "text": "Thomas Lee (Virginia colonist)\n\nCol. Thomas Lee (c. 1690–November 14, 1750) was a leading political figure of colonial Virginia. He was a member of the Lee family, a political dynasty which included many figures from the pre-American Revolutionary War era until the late 20th century. Lee became involved in politics in 1710 and he became the resident manager of the Northern Neck Proprietary for Lady Catherine Fairfax. After his father died, he inherited land in Northumberland and Charles County. Lee later acquired vast holdings in what are now Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Prince William, and Loudoun Counties. These properties were developed as tobacco plantations.\n\nWhen Lee married Hannah Harrison Ludwell in 1722, he benefited by the connections of the already established Harrison family. A year later he would become a member of the House of Burgesses. After Lee's home was burnt down by criminals, he lost almost all of his possessions and a fair sum of money. With donations received from Caroline of Ansbach and English Commissioners, he built his new home on the Potomac River, naming it Stratford Hall. Four years later in 1733, he was appointed to the Governor's Council, upper house of the General Assembly. In 1747, he founded the Ohio Company of Virginia with fellow Virginian colonists who wished to expand Virginia's territory into the Ohio River Valley. For a period of less than a year, in 1749, he became the \"de facto\" Governor of Virginia in place of the absent William Gooch. Lee was favored for an appointment as governor by George II but the colonist died in 1750.\n\nThomas Lee was born around 1690 at Mount Pleasant, on the Machodoc River in Westmoreland County, Virginia. His parents were Col. Richard Lee II, \"the scholar\", and Laetitia Corbin. His ancestors had immigrated from Coton, Shropshire, England to Virginia in 1642. As the fourth son of the couple, Lee would not receive as large an inheritance as his older brothers. This did not prevent him from becoming successful in politics.\n\nLee attended college at The College of William and Mary around 1700. Lee's education was referred to as a \"common Virginia education\". He soon became interested in the working of the tobacco industry. He left home to work with his uncle Thomas Corbin in the tobacco business.\n\nLee's political career began in 1710 when he was appointed as Naval Officer of the Potomac River. The position was previously held by his father and upon his resignation, Lee was appointed as the new Naval Officer. In 1711, Lee's uncle Thomas Corbin helped him gain the position of Virginia agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary. As a result, he was appointed by Catherine (Culpeper) Fairfax, Lady Fairfax, who was living in England, as her agent and resident manager for the Northern Neck Proprietary, which she had inherited from her father, Governor Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper. Catherine was the wife of Thomas Fairfax, 5th Baron Fairfax. This property, which consisted of approximately six million acres (24,000 km²), included all the land between the Potomac and Rappahnnock rivers.\n\nAt one time Edmund Jenings, another Lee uncle, headed this Proprietary. While Jenings was in England, the offices of the agency were located at the plantation at Machodoc and under Lee's supervision. Due to Jening's poor management, the agency was given to Governor Robert \"King\" Carter in 1720. This event led to animosity between the competitive Lee and Carter families. The members of the families refused to marry each other until Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee married Anne Hill Carter. Henry and Anne's most notable child was Robert E. Lee.\n\nThomas held this position until 1722. In 1713, Thomas succeeded his father as Naval Officer in charge of collecting customs for the south side of the Potomac.\n\nIn 1714, upon his father's death, Lee inherited lands in Northumberland County near Dividing Creek, as well as land in Maryland adjoining his brother Philip Lee, Sr. of \"Blenheim\". Thomas leased the estate \"Machodoc\" from his brother Richard Lee III who was in London. That same year Thomas visited England, remaining for about a year.\n\nLee thought that marriage was not only important between two individuals but for their families. A nephew of his later said, \"Our Late Hon[ora]ble & worthy Unkle Presid[ent] Lee said that the first fall & ruin of families and estates was mostly Occasioned by Imprudent Matches to Imbeggar families and estates & to beget a race of beggars.\" He was engaged to Jenny Wilson in 1716. That year he returned to England to formalize the lease to the plantation before he married. Before his return, Jenny Wilson had found another husband, James Roscoe. Lee learned this from William Byrd.\n\nLee and his brother Henry negotiated a lease for 99 years on the plantation. During his stay in England, Lee had decided to buy some property on the Potomac River called the \"Clifts Plantation\" in Westmoreland County. At the time, the property was owned by Nathaniel Pope, Jr., a mariner, of London. Lee believed that when Virginia gained its independence, the capital would be located on the Potomac River. He later renamed it as Stratford. Thomas purchased his father's old estate \"Machodoc\", from his sister-in-law, Martha Silk, the former wife of his older brother, Richard Lee III. \"Machodoc\" was later known as \"Mount Pleasant\".\n\nIn May 1722, Thomas Lee married Hannah Harrison Ludwell (December 5, 1701 – January 25, 1750), a member of the prominent Harrison family, at \"Greenspring\", James City County, Virginia. The marriage lasted his life and brought him increased wealth and status. Hannah was the daughter of Philip Ludwell II of \"Greenspring\", and Hannah Harrison. The couple had eleven children; eight survived to adulthood:\n\n1728 was a tragic year for Lee and his family. On January 29, thieves broke into the house stealing the Lee family plate, jewelry, and other articles of value, and upon leaving, set fire to the plantation house at Machodoc. The fire destroyed the entire plantation, including Thomas' office, the barns, and outhouses. Almost all of the Lees' possessions were destroyed, as well as up to 10,000 pounds in cash (equal to £ today). The house quickly burned and Hannah Lee, being pregnant with her fourth child, had to be thrown from her chamber window on the second floor. This resulted in Hannah's miscarriage of a son (they named him John). also injured in the fire was a slave girl, who died. Virginia Governor William Gooch blamed transported convicts for the crime. It is said that Col. Lee's loss was not less than 50,000 pounds (equal to £ today). English Commissioners later gave Lee 300 pounds (equal to £ today) as compensation and Queen Caroline also gave him money from her private purse to help with rebuilding. The convicts and an accomplice were later found guilty. Their punishment is unknown because the trial records were destroyed. When construction began on the new Lee mansion, the family stayed with Thomas's brother Henry at Lee Hall. Lee sold the \"Machodoc\" estate to Richard Lee III's son, George Lee, who built \"Mount Pleasant\".\n\nLee's political career required trips to Williamsburg, causing him to be away from his family for extended periods of time. Lee managed to make the 80-mile (130-km) journey to his family and to be with his wife at the births of each of their children. Several of the sons became high-ranking political figures and were active in the American Revolutionary War and post-Revolution politics. Richard Henry was a senator from Virginia to the United States Senate and Francis Lightfoot was in the Virginia Senate. Lee's youngest sons William Lee and Arthur Lee served as diplomats to various European countries. William, along with Jan de Neufville, drafted an unofficial treaty between the United States and the Netherlands which Great Britain used as a reason for the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War.\n\nLee later became a vestryman for Copole Parish and Justice of the Peace in Westmoreland County. In 1723, Lee became a member of the House of Burgesses. He held this office until he was appointed to the Governor's Council in the Virginia General Assembly in 1733. This position was a lifetime appointment. The Council was made up of twelve appointees who were selected by the Governor of Virginia and was the upper half of the Virginia General Assembly. The lower half was made up of the House of Burgesses. This position also gave Lee the rank of Colonel, a military rank that was second only to the governor. Members of the Council were advisers to the governor and judges in the General Court of the colony. Their work led them to spend about a third of the year in the capital Williamsburg.\n\nWhen Governor William Gooch was recalled to England in 1749, Lee was named President of the King's Council of Virginia and Commander-in-Chief of the colony. Nominated for appointment as Governor of Virginia by King George II, he died before it took place.\n\nLee was appointed commissioner, along with William Beverley, to negotiate with the Six Nations of the Iroquois at the Treaty of Lancaster in 1744. At the treaty, an agreement was made with the Six Nations for 400 pounds (equal to £ today) in return for the right for Virginians to travel through and settle in the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nIn 1747, Lee co-founded the Ohio Company of Virginia along with Lawrence Washington, Augustine Washington, Jr., the Duke of Bedford, and John Hanbury. The Ohio Company was a land speculation venture which helped colonize the Ohio Country. Lee's influence as a member of the Governor's Council helped lead to the success of the Ohio Company and within seven years the company had 100 families living in Ohio. He was also the first president of the Company and after Lee died, was succeeded by Lawrence Washington.\n\nWith Lee's higher rank in society and wealth, he decided he needed to build a mansion to secure his position as one of the Virginia gentry. he chose the \"Clifts,\" which he had owned since the mid-1710s. Lee decided on this site because it was located in Westmoreland County, where he was born, and because it was located on the Potomac River. The land was sufficient for having many construction laborers live there. Hannah had an influential say in the design and planning of the interior of the house. Philip, the couple's eldest son, had said, \"See what it is to be ruled by a woman. I should have been now living in a house like this ... had not my father been persuaded by his wife to put up this very inferior dwelling, now over my head.\" The exact construction date of the house is unknown but it is estimated that construction began around 1725-30, as all of Lee's sons were born at Stratford. Workers on the plantation were from all the working class: free people and indentured servants mostly from the British Isles, and African slaves.\n\nBetween 1719 and 1746, Lee acquired vast holdings in what are now Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Prince William, and Loudoun counties. The town of Leesburg, was named in his honor as recommended by his two sons, who were the founders and trustees.\n\nHannah Harrison died at \"Stratford\" on January 25, 1749, having borne eleven children. She was buried in the old family burying ground, called the \"Burnt House Fields\", at \"Mount Pleasant\". Her tombstone was later removed to \"Stratford Hall\", probably by Henry Lee, who built the new vault at that place. On November 14, 1750, Thomas Lee died at age sixty and was buried in the old \"Burnt House Fields\" at Mount Pleasant. According to his will, he wished to be buried in between his wife and his mother. He bequeathed Stratford Hall to his eldest son, Philip Ludwell Lee, and the Machodoc plantation to his nephew, George Lee.\n\n\n"}
