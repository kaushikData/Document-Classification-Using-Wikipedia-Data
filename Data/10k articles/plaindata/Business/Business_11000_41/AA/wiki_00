Harter. It is the sequel to \"First, Break All the Rules\", although the first book was written by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman. Both books are based on The Gallup Organization's research on employee engagement and database of employee opinions.\n\n\"12\" tells the story of a dozen managers selected from Gallup's global database of 10 million interviews with managers and employees. Each of the chapters in \"12\" is based on one of the \"Q\" statements that emerged from Gallup's meta-analysis comparing employee attitudes with workgroup performance. These range from employee's \"knowing what's expected\" and having the needed \"materials and equipment\" to more emotional assessments such as whether the employees feels his or her opinion counts and whether he or she has had chances to \"learn and grow.\" The story of each manager profiled in the book is interrupted mid-chapter to describe the psychology behind the particular question Gallup asks in its employee surveys.\n\nThe most controversial of the statements, write Wagner and Harter, is the tenth: \"I have best friend at work.\" The authors claim friendships, in combination with the other \"elements,\" create better customer scores, better retention, better safety, and higher productivity and profitability. \"In the battle between company policy and human nature, human nature always wins,\" states the book. \"Companies do far better to harness this kind of social capital than to fight against it.\"\n\nThe book also includes a chapter on compensation. The authors assert that pay is such a \"status-laden, envy-inspiring, politically charged monster\" that it cannot be measured in the same way as the aspects that make up the bulk of the book. Being based in research on how people react in real life, rather than in theory, \"12\" is a mainstream application of behavioral economics.\n\n"}
{"id": "32708802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32708802", "title": "ACSOI", "text": "ACSOI\n\nACSOI (Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income) (also called Adjusted CSOI) is a non-GAAP accounting metric. \n\nThe metric amortizes marketing and acquisition costs over several accounting periods. The \"Adjusted\" part of the metric increases (\"inflates\") a company's reported net income in the most recent accounting period. The rationale behind the use of ACSOI is that marketing and subscriber acquisition expenses have value long into the future: they build a brand; therefore, they should be spread out over time. Cash spent on marketing is not expensed: it is converted into another asset (\"subscriber acquisition assets, net\") on a company's balance sheet.\n\nThis presentation of net income is prohibited by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, arbiters of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) in the United States. In GAAP, marketing expenses may be accrued in some situations as prepaid expenses, but only amortized in special cases. Deferred acquisition costs are typically only allowed for amortizing the acquisition costs of customers in businesses like insurance, where the amortization occurs over the well-defined duration of a contract. ACSOI can be a useful internal metric for businesses to determine financial performance and to make strategic management decisions, if they believe their subscriber acquisition costs are an up-front cash outlay that truly builds long-term customer assets commensurate with that outlay. A main argument for not using this metric in GAAP accounting is that there is a key difference between subscribers and customers: customers make purchases and generate revenue for the business; it may be faulty to assume that all subscriber acquisition costs can be amortized as assets if only an unknown portion of the acquired subscribers will actually convert to customers.\n\nThe use of ACSOI came under scrutiny in August 2011, when it was revealed the company Groupon used the metric to present a net gain in operating income in their IPO filing. Without the ACSOI metric, Groupon would have stated a net loss.\n"}

He is commonly known as Gounass. He went to an Islamic school in Medina Gounass. Abdoulaye came to Zambia in 1972 and started his business of buying and selling of emeralds from Lufwanya on the Copperbelt of Zambia until he bought an emerald mine in 1997. He later married in 1981 and settled in Kitwe where he established his other businesses. Abdoulaye is also a principal shareholder in International companies such as Ontario Group of Companies S.A, a real estate company based in Dakar, Senegal, and Gounasse International Inc, a company involved in real estate as well as in the hospitality industry. \nAbdoulaye started his career by buying and selling of emeralds. In 1997 he purchased an emerald mine on the Copperbelt of Zambia. The major product that Abdoulaye's mine produces is raw and partially processed emeralds and beryl. Zambian Emeralds tend to have more of a bluish cast than either Brazilian or Colombian emeralds, and tend towards a slight grayish cast, which is not present in either Colombian or Brazilian Emeralds. The Zambian and Brazilian Emeralds may also be coloured due to the presence of vanadium, whereas Colombian Emeralds usually achieve their coloration from the presence of chromium.\n\nAbdoulaye's companies have created employment and business opportunities for more than 800 people in Zambia and Senegal, this in turn contributes significantly towards government revenue, in terms of various taxes.\nGemcanton is based in Kitwe and owned by Abdoulaye. The company contributes in gemstone mining including emerald and beryl production. The company focuses on improving the lives of indigenous people residing within the vicinity of mine-sites. Gemcanton has invested in education by constructing two community schools in the district, one of which has since been handed over to the Ministry of Education. The company is involved in the annual road maintenance works throughout the district. Gemcanton is the principal sponsor of Afrisport Club from 2012, which is now playing in Division 2. Kitwe United were sponsored up to December 2012.\nGrizzly Mining Limited was incorporated as mining company by Abdoulaye in 1997 and subsequently other companies were incorporated.

Previously, he was Prime Minister of Estonia from 2005 to 2014 and chairman of the liberal Estonian Reform Party () from 2004 to 2014.\n\nBefore his entry into politics Ansip trained as a chemist, before working in banking and business. He entered Parliament in 2004, quickly becoming Minister of Economic Affairs, and subsequently Prime Minister in April 2005. On 1 November 2014, he was appointed to the European Commission.\n\nBorn in Tartu, Ansip graduated from the University of Tartu with a degree in Chemistry in 1979. He worked as an engineer at the university from 1979 to 1983 (with a two-year break for mandatory military service). He was an Instructor in the Industry Department and Head of the Organisational Department of the Tartu District Committee of the Estonian Communist Party from 1986 to 1988. Ansip has been involved in several banking and investment ventures. He has served as a Member of the Board of Directors of the People’s Bank of Tartu (), Chairman of the Board of Livonia Privatisation IF, and CEO of Investment Fund Broker Ltd (). He also has served as Chairman of the board for Radio Tartu.\n\nIn 1998, Ansip was elected as Mayor of Tartu as a candidate of the centrist-right \"Reformierakond\" (Reform Party), a position which he held until 2004, to great popular acclaim and very high ratings in the opinion polls. He had run in previous elections for the \"Riigikogu\", the Estonian Parliament, but had always given up his seat in order to remain Mayor. He was succeeded by fellow Reform Party member Laine Jänes.\n\nOn 21 November 2004, Ansip became Chairman of Estonian Reform Party because the party's founder and hitherto chairman, former Prime Minister Siim Kallas, had become EU Commissioner and Vice President and thus had to move to Brussels. It was obvious that Ansip would have to move to Tallinn, and a chance opened up when the Minister of Economic Affairs and Communications in the coalition government of Juhan Parts, Meelis Atonen, a party colleague, had to resign. Ansip became his successor on 13 September. His track record as Minister is more difficult to evaluate because of the short duration of his service.\n\nOn 31 March 2005, Ansip was charged by President Arnold Rüütel to form a government, following 24 March 2005 resignation by Prime Minister Juhan Parts. Ansip was able to form a coalition with the Centre Party and the People's Union of Estonia, which was approved by the Riigikogu on 12 April 2005. Ansip thus became Prime Minister of Estonia. He was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Riigikogu, 40 deputies voting against. He and the ministers were inaugurated in office the next day, on 13 April.\n\nOn 4 March 2007, Ansip's Reform Party won 27 percent of the vote in the Estonian parliamentary elections, raising its mandate in the Riigikogu to 31 seats from 19. Ansip personally received over 22,500 votes. He was charged by President Toomas Hendrik Ilves to form a government. This time the Reform Party formed a coalition with the Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica (IRL) and the Social Democratic Party. His second term as Prime Minister began on 5 April 2007. In May 2009, the Social Democrats left the government, and as coalition talks with the People's Union of Estonia failed, it was decided to continue with a minority government of the Reform Party and IRL.\nIn March 2011, the Reform Party won 33 seats in the Riigikogu, remaining the largest party even after the country's economic output had fallen by 14 percent in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and the collapse of a real estate price bubble fueled by cheap and easy credit from Nordic banks. Ansip was once again charged by President Toomas Hendrik Ilves to form a government. The Reform Party continued in a coalition with the Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica. Ansip's third term as Prime Minister began on 6 April 2011, when \"Riigikogu\" approved his third cabinet.\n\nBut Ansip's center-right coalition soon struggled in polls amid signs of voter fatigue at years of a government focused on fiscal austerity as well as several high-profile party funding scandals. The center-left opposition also gained popularity.\n\nOn 4 March 2014, Ansip announced his resignation to enable a successor to lead his party into 2015 elections. From 4 December 2013 to 26 March 2014 he was the longest-serving prime minister in the European Union.\n\nIn the 2014 European elections, Ansip was elected as an MEP received the largest number of preferential votes in Estonia. Shortly after, Prime Minister Taavi Roivas nominated him as the country’s next European Commissioner.\n\nOn 10 September 2014 President-Elect Juncker of the European Commission announced that he proposed Andrus Ansip as Vice-President of the European Commission and the European Commissioner for the Digital Single Market. He was formally appointed by the European Council as Vice President with the consent of the European Parliament.\n\nOne of the most controversial actions of Ansip's government was relocation of the \"Bronze Soldier of Tallinn\" from a prominent location in the center of Tallinn to the Defence Forces Cemetery of Tallinn adjacent to the city center. The removal of the monument, as well as war graves, from its current location on 27 April 2007 led to mass protests and two nights of the worst rioting Estonia has seen since regaining independence.\n\nAndrus Ansip is married to gynecologist Anu Ansip (b. 1956) and they have three daughters Reet (b. 1977), who is a stomatologist; Tiina (b. 1981) who is a journalist and Liisa (b. 1997).\n\nAndrus Ansip is a member of the Estonian voluntary home guard organisation Kaitseliit (Defence League) since 10 November 2009.\n\n\n"}

Initiated as a way of avoiding currency regulations, the practice had, by the mid-1990s, largely been replaced by currency swaps.\n\nOne disadvantage of such agreements is asymmetrical liability - absent a specific agreement, when one party defaults on the loan, the other party may still be held responsible for repayment. Another disadvantage in comparison with currency swaps is that back-to-back loan transactions are customarily recorded on banking institutions' records as liabilities and thereby increase their capitalization requirements, while currency swaps were, during the 2000s, widely exempted from this requirement.\n\n"}

CPA Australia currently has 19 staffed offices across Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, New Zealand and the UK.\n\nThe current form of CPA Australia dates from 1952, when the Commonwealth Institute and Federal Institute merged to create the Australian Society of Accountants. In July 1990 the name changed to the Australian Society of Certified Practicing Accountants, and in April 2000, the name became CPA Australia.\n\nThe main predecessor bodies of the Society, with year of formation, were:\n\nThe CEO of CPA Australia from 2008, Alex Malley, came under significant criticism in the media and from CPA members in 2017 for his $1.8 million annual salary and for the significant amounts of CPA funds going towards promoting Malley and his personal interests, such as a paid television show and Malley's autobiography. The scandal surrounding Malley, combined with broader member discontent over executive changes that made the board unaccountable and debts accrued from the establishment of a financial planning arm, led to the resignation of the CPA president Tyrone Carlin in May 2017, and then to two board members resigning a week later in June 2017. The resigning board members, Richard Alston and Kerry Ryan, cited the presence of \"board allies of chief executive Alex Malley\" refusing to \"allow a wide-ranging review of Mr Malley and the organisation\" as their main reason. The board resignations had also followed former Future Fund Chairman and Commonwealth Bank CEO, David Murray, who resigned his 40-year CPA membership in response to what he saw as poor management within CPA.\n\nOn 15 June, a further three directors resigned due to the expanding scandal surrounding Malley and the remaining board initiated an \"independent review\" of all claims made against CPA and its CEO, to be chaired by former chief of the Australian Defence Force, Sir Angus Houston. However, even the decision to create the review came under criticism when it was revealed that Houston had appeared as guest on Malley's TV program and had written a glowing foreword in Malley's book. Houston later resigned his post in favour of former Commonwealth Auditor-General, Ian McPhee.\n\nFacing a significant swelling of discontent amongst CPA members, in June 2017 it was announced that the CPA board had terminated the contract of Malley, resulting in CPA paying out the remainder of his contract to the sum of $4.9 million. On the developing scandal, Sydney Morning Herald journalist Colin Kruger noted: \"Accountancy is meant to be the profession of sober financial clarity. [...] Not the sort of profession for flashy types, accountants are meant to be the score keepers, not the goal scorers. It makes the lack of accountability, and financial clarity, from the top accounting body in Australia – CPA Australia – all the more incongruous.\"\n\nIn August 2017, it was announced that the remaining board members would resign their positions at the end of the year, to make way for an entirely new board. The subsequent review report released in September 2017 found that the \"chief executive was overpaid, [CPA Australia] had lost touch with its members and provided questionable value for money for the services it rendered.\" In addition to CPA's \"over-emphasis on marketing and brand building activities that centred on the former CEO\", the review in particular noted the excessive CEO's salary, with its many increases over several years not being justified by organisational growth.\n\n Full members of CPA Australia use the designatory letters CPA, while senior members may become Fellows and use the letters FCPA.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8957", "title": "DARPA", "text": "DARPA\n\nThe Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is an agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.\n\nOriginally known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the agency was created in February 1958 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 in 1957. By collaborating with academic, industry, and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate U.S. military requirements.\n\nDARPA-funded projects have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as computer networking and the basis for the modern Internet, and graphical user interfaces in information technology.\n\nDARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management. DARPA has about 220 employees, of whom approximately 100 are in management.\n\nThe name of the organization first changed from its founding name ARPA to DARPA in March 1972, momentarily changing back to ARPA in February 1993, only to revert to DARPA in March 1996.\n\nCurrently, DARPA's mission statement is \"to make pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies for national security\". \n\nThe creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was authorized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958 for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements, the two relevant acts being the Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force) (Public Law 85-325) and Department of Defense Directive 5105.15, in February 1958. Its creation was directly attributed to the launching of Sputnik and to U.S. realization that the Soviet Union had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology. Initial funding of ARPA was $520 million. ARPA's first director, Roy Johnson, left a $160,000 management job at General Electric for an $18,000 job at ARPA. Herbert York from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was hired as his scientific assistant.\n\nJohnson and York were both keen on space projects, but when NASA was established later in 1958 all space projects and most of ARPA's funding were transferred to it. Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do \"high-risk\", \"high-gain\", \"far out\" basic research, a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nation's scientists and research universities. ARPA's second director was Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, who resigned in early 1961. He was succeeded by Jack Ruina who served until 1963. Ruina, the first scientist to administer ARPA, managed to raise its budget to $250 million. It was Ruina who hired J. C. R. Licklider as the first administrator of the Information Processing Techniques Office, which played a vital role in creation of ARPANET, the basis for the future Internet.\n\nAdditionally, the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high-level Department of Defense organization to formulate and execute R&D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories. In pursuit of this mission, DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1965, ARPA's emphasis centered on major national issues, including space, ballistic missile defense, and nuclear test detection. During 1960, all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the military space programs to the individual services.\n\nThis allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the Project Defender (defense against ballistic missiles), Project Vela (nuclear test detection), and Project AGILE (counterinsurgency R&D) programs, and to begin work on computer processing, behavioral sciences, and materials sciences. The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor, surveillance, and directed energy R&D, particularly in the study of radar, infrared sensing, and x-ray/gamma ray detection.\n\nARPA at this point (1959) played an early role in Transit (also called NavSat) a predecessor to the Global Positioning System (GPS). \"Fast-forward to 1959 when a joint effort between DARPA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory began to fine-tune the early explorers’ discoveries. TRANSIT, sponsored by the Navy and developed under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite positioning system.\"\n\nDuring the late 1960s, with the transfer of these mature programs to the Services, ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small, essentially exploratory research programs. The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972, and during the early 1970s, it emphasized direct energy programs, information processing, and tactical technologies.\n\nConcerning information processing, DARPA made great progress, initially through its support of the development of time-sharing (all modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the Multics system, developed by a cooperation among Bell Labs, General Electric and MIT, which DARPA supported by funding Project MAC at MIT with an initial two-million-dollar grant).\n\nDARPA supported the evolution of the ARPANET (the first wide-area packet switching network), Packet Radio Network, Packet Satellite Network and ultimately, the Internet and research in the artificial intelligence fields of speech recognition and signal processing, including parts of Shakey the robot. DARPA also funded the development of the Douglas Engelbart's NLS computer system and The Mother of All Demos; and the Aspen Movie Map, which was probably the first hypermedia system and an important precursor of virtual reality.\n\nThe Mansfield Amendment of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research (through ARPA/DARPA) only to projects with direct military application. Some contend that the amendment devastated American science, since ARPA/DARPA was a major funding source for basic science projects of the time; the National Science Foundation never made up the difference as expected.\n\nThe resulting \"brain drain\" is also credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry. Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as Xerox PARC.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1981, DARPA's major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing. These large-scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research, which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) Program and the Congressionally-mandated charged particle beam program.\n\nMany of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in automatic target recognition, space based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO), later known as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), now titled the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).\n\nDuring the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the National Aerospace Plane (NASP) or Hypersonic Research Program. The Strategic Computing Program enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the Vietnam War. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites (LIGHTSAT) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.\n\nOn October 28, 2009 the agency broke ground on a new facility in Arlington, Virginia a few miles from the Pentagon.\n\nIn fall 2011, DARPA hosted the 100-Year Starship Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel.\n\nOn June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA announced that it planned to build new X-planes with NASA's plan setting to create a whole series of X planes over the next 10 years.\n\nIn July 2016, it was announced that DARPA would bring a group of top-notch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities and create a fix that patches those vulnerabilities and it is called the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC).\n\nIn June 2018, DARPA leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the GXV-T program. The goal of this program is to create a lightly armored combat vehicle of not very large dimensions, which, due to maneuverability and other tricks, can successfully resist modern anti-tank weapon systems.\n\nDARPA has six technical offices that manage the agency's research portfolio, and two additional support offices that manage special projects and transition efforts. All offices report to the DARPA director:\n\n\nA 1991 reorganization created several offices which existed throughout the early 1990s:\nReorganization in 2010 merged two offices:\n\nA list of DARPA's active and archived projects is available on the agency's website. Because of the agency's fast pace, programs constantly start and stop based on the needs of the U.S. government. Structured information about some of the DARPA's contracts and projects is publicly available.\n\n"}

She was the publisher of the literary magazine \"The Paris Review\" (1993 to 2007), co-founded Ecco Press, founded literary retreats and endowed the Drue Heinz Literature Prize among others. She was married to H. J. Heinz II, president of Heinz.\n\nHeinz was born Doreen Mary English in Norfolk, England to Irish parents. Her father, Patrick Harry English, was an Army officer, and her mother was Edith Wodehouse.\n\nHer first husband was John Mackenzie Robertson with whom she had one daughter, Wendy Mackenzie. Her second husband was Dale Wilford Maher, the first Secretary of the U. S. Legation in Johannesburg, South Africa (died 1948). They had a daughter Marigold Randall. In 1953, Drue became the third wife of H. J. Heinz II (1908–1987), then president of Heinz company and heir to the Heinz fortune. With Heinz she became the stepmother of John Heinz (1938–1991) who later became a Pennsylvania United States Senator.\n\nPrior to her marriage to Heinz she was an actress. As \"Doreen English\" she had a small role in the 1948 movie \"Uneasy Terms\", which starred Michael Rennie. Using the name Drue Mallory, she was cast in three 1950 movies, \"Please Believe Me\", starring Deborah Kerr, \"Three Came Home\" and \"Breakthrough\".\n\nThe Heinz home in Pittsburgh was called \"Goodwood\", in Sewickley Heights. They also had an apartment in New York's Upper East Side, and a winter retreat in Hobe Sound, Florida. For many years, their British home was Ascot Place at North Ascot in Winkfield, Berkshire.\n\nHeinz would buy houses, restore them and turn them into writers' retreats. She purchased Hawthornden Castle, a medieval fortress outside Edinburgh, Scotland and made it into a place for writers to live and work called the Hawthornden Literary Retreat. The Heinz Italian home, called Villa Maresi, was on Lake Como in the town of Griante. She called it \"Casa Ecco\", and writers would go there for discussions. \"She was very close to Tom Wolfe, Norman Mailer, Andy Warhol, Harold Pinter and Antonia Fraser,\" according to Daniel Halpern, founder of Ecco Press. She was reportedly close friends with Tom Stoppard, John Le Carré, Joseph Brodsky, Edna O’Brien and Seamus Heaney.\n\nOf her character, Teresa Heinz said \"Drue was a very private person but she came to know an amazing group of people in her life. She was smart and passionate and deeply interested in art, literature, and especially poetry.\" Of her reputation, Jonathan Galassi, President, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, said \n\nHeinz died on March 30, 2018, at age 103, at Hawthornden Castle in Lasswade, Scotland.\n\nIn 1971, with the encouragement of her friend James Laughlin, she co-founded Ecco Press. In addition to the literary magazine \"Antaeus\", which she funded from 1970 to its closing in 1994, Ecco published many out of print books, and was one of the leading US publishers of poetry.\n\nHeinz began supporting the University of Pittsburgh's fiction prize in 1980. In 1995, she endowed the prize with a $1 million gift at which point it became known as the Drue Heinz Literature Prize. The prize publishes collections of short fiction through the University of Pittsburgh Press. \"The revenue from that million has exceeded the needs of the press for publication and promotion of the Heinz books so it keeps growing,\" said Ed Ochester, editor of the press in 2018. Heinz also endowed the Hawthornden Prize for many years.\n\nWhen the archives of \"The Paris Review\" were sold to the Morgan Library in 1999, Heinz paid the purchase price of $850,000. Heinz was close friends with the founder, George Plimpton, and was herself publisher of the \"Review\" from 1993 to 2007. Heinz was among those who helped found the paper in 1953 and over the years help fund it.\n\nIn 1970, she restored an old movie theater into the Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts, which was the founding institution of what would later become the Cultural District, Pittsburgh. Heinz gave $10 million to Carnegie Institute for the creation of the Heinz Architectural Center in 1990. Heinz also supported London's Tate Gallery and the Royal Institute of British Architects. Funds from her foundation help publish the \"Lincoln Center Theater Review\".\n\nShe was the sponsor of The Royal Oak Foundation's Drue Heinz Lecture Series and served as the Foundation's Honorary Chairman. In 2002, Heinz endowed a Chair jointly held at St. John's College, Oxford and the Rothermere American Institute, University of Oxford called the Drue Heinz Professor of American Literature. She endowed the position of the Drue Heinz Librarian at the American Academy in Rome.

{"id": "344258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344258", "title": "Edgar Bronfman Sr.", "text": "Edgar Bronfman Sr.\n\nEdgar Miles Bronfman (June 20, 1929 – December 21, 2013) was a Canadian-American businessman and philanthropist. He worked for his family distilled beverage firm, Seagram, eventually becoming president, treasurer and CEO. As President of the World Jewish Congress, Bronfman is especially remembered for initiating diplomacy with the Soviet Union, which resulted in legitimizing the Hebrew language in Russia, and contributed to Soviet Jews being legally able to practice their own religion, as well as emigrate to Israel.\n\nBronfman was born into the Jewish-Canadian Bronfman family in Montreal, the son of Samuel Bronfman, a Russian who had emigrated to Canada with his parents, and Saidye Rosner Bronfman, a native of Manitoba born to Eastern European immigrants. They raised their four children in Montreal.\n\nIn 1925, Sam and his brother, Allan, built the family’s first liquor distillery near Montreal. They later bought a distillery owned by the Seagram family and incorporated the name. The U.S. subsidiary of the Seagram Company Ltd. opened in 1933; Edgar Bronfman would later take charge of the subsidiary.\n\nBronfman had two older sisters: architect Phyllis Lambert, and Minda de Gunzburg, who married Baron Alain de Gunzburg (1925-2004), a great grandson of Joseph Günzburg. Bronfman also had a younger brother, Charles Bronfman. The Bronfmans \"kept a kosher home, and the children received religious schooling on weekends. But during the week Edgar and his younger brother, Charles, were among a handful of Jews sent to private Anglophone schools, where they attended chapel and ate pork.\"\n\nBronfman attended Selwyn House School in Montreal, and Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, Canada. He next attended Williams College, then transferred to McGill University, where he graduated from in 1951 with a bachelor's degree in commerce.\n\nAfter graduating from McGill University with a B.A. degree, in 1951, he joined the family business, where he worked as an accounting clerk and apprentice taster. In 1953, he took over as head of the Seagram U.S. subsidiary, Joseph E. Seagram & Sons. He increased the range of products sold by the company, improved distribution, and expanded the number of countries in which Seagram's products were sold. In 1966, Cemp Investments, which managed the family's investments, bought 820,000 shares of MGM and, in 1969, Bronfman took over the chairmanship of MGM, albeit briefly.\n\nFollowing his father's death, in 1971, Bronfman took over as president, treasurer and director of Distillers Corporation-Seagram Ltd. His son, Edgar Jr., succeeded him as chief executive officer of the company in 1994.\n\nWhen former World Jewish Congress President Philip Klutznick stepped down in 1979, Bronfman was asked to take over as acting head of the organization, then was formally elected President by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, in January 1981. Together with his deputy, Israel Singer, Bronfman led the World Jewish Congress in becoming the preeminent international Jewish organization that it is today. Initiatives such as those seeking to help free Soviet Jewry; expose Austrian President Kurt Waldheim's Nazi past; and to help victims of the Holocaust and their heirs to acquire compensation (including by Swiss banks); raised Bronfman's international profile during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn 1983, Bronfman suggested that \"American Jews should abandon their strongest weapon, the Jackson–Vanik amendment, as a sign of goodwill that challenges the Soviets to respond in kind.\"\n\nAfter Mikhail Gorbachev's ascension in 1985, Bronfman's \"New York Times\" message began to resonate with the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured an invitation to the Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nIn a \"Washington Post\" profile a few months after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been accomplished during his September meetings. He said, \"There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved.\" Author Gal Beckerman says in his \"When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone\", \"Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration.\"\n\nIn March 1987, Bronfman along with fellow delegates of the World Jewish Congress, flew to Moscow once again. Bronfman held three days of discussions with senior Soviet officials. Together, Bronfman and the World Jewish Congress delegates advocated for the freeing of the Jews living under Soviet rule.\n\nOn June 25, 1982, Bronfman became the first representative of a Jewish organization to speak before the United Nations. Speaking before the Special Session on Disarmament, Bronfman said, \"world peace cannot tolerate the denial of the legitimacy of Israel or any other nation-state ... [and the] charge that Zionism is racism is an abomination.\"\n\nBronfman's goals for the visit were threefold. In his book, \"The Making of a Jew,\" he explained: First, he called for the release of all so-called Prisoners of Zion, the Jews imprisoned for expressing a desire to emigrate to Israel. Bronfman also wanted freedom for Jews in the Soviet Union to practice their religion. Finally, he called for the freedom for Soviet Jews to learn Hebrew, which was forbidden at the time.\n\nA year later, in 1988, Bronfman returned to Moscow to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. This trip resulted in the Soviets promising to legalize the teaching of Hebrew in the Soviet Union and to establish a Jewish cultural center in Moscow. Bronfman said of this visit, \"By their actions, they are indicating that they are eager to get the question of Jewish rights and emigration off the bargaining table. And it is actions, rather than simply words, that count.\"\nIn 1986, during Bronfman's presidency, the World Jewish Congress accused Austrian President Kurt Waldheim of covering up his past connections to the Nazi party. It was when Waldheim became a candidate for president that the World Jewish Congress first published material showing Waldheim's active duty in the German army during wartime. This evidence was later used to prove that Waldheim must have known about the deportation of Jews to concentration camps, though Waldheim's service as an Austrian in the German army cannot be considered a war crime. Waldheim had served as an intelligence officer in a unit of the army that participated in the transfer of Greek Jews to death camps. The allegations against Waldheim resulted in public embarrassment for the Austrian president.\n\nOn May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was \"part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine\". Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after due to a lack of evidence in his favor.\n\nAccording to Joel Bainerman, in 1991 he was appointed to the International Jewish Committee for Inter-religious Consultations to conduct official contacts between the Vatican and the State of Israel.\nIn the late 1990s, Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors. Bronfman began an initiative that led to the $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks. This settlement aimed to resolve claims \"that they hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis\". The Swiss banks, the United States Government, and Jewish groups investigated unclaimed assets deposited by European Jews into Swiss banks before the Holocaust. Negotiations began in 1995 between the U.S. and Switzerland. The parties reached a settlement in August 1998, and signed the $1.25 billion settlement in January 1999. In exchange for the settlement money, both parties agreed to release the Swiss banks and government from any claims regarding the Holocaust. The settlement was officially approved on November 22, 2000, by Judge Edward R. Korman.\n\nBronfman was accused by another WJC official of \"perfidy\" when he wrote a letter to President Bush in mid-2003 urging Bush to pressure Israel to curb construction of its controversial West Bank separation barrier, co-signed by former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. Former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres said in support of Bronfman, \"Clearly, issues that are open for debate in Israel should be open for debate in the Jewish world.\"\n\nBronfman stepped down from his post as President on May 7, 2007, amid scandals and turmoil about Israel Singer. Bronfman's leadership is known for transforming the World Jewish Congress into the powerful organization it is today. As president, Bronfman is remembered most for his diplomacy with the Soviet Union in freeing Soviet Jews.\n\nAt his memorial held in January 2014, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said of Bronfman, \"Edgar was never shy of pressing an issue in the face of injustice,\" as she spoke about the many causes he championed in his lifetime.\n\nBronfman was married five times (twice to his third wife).\n\n\nIn 1993, a \"Forbes\" magazine article reported that Bronfman took a course from NXIVM, endorsing it, but had since \"grown troubled\" due to the \"emotional and financial investment\" daughters Clare and Sara were giving to Raniere's group, remarking that Clare had loaned NXIVM $2 million, though she denied this. Bronfman was quoted stating, \"I think it's a cult.\" In 2018, Raniere, then daughter Clare and her long-time mentor NXIVM president Nancy Salzman, among others, were arrested on federal charges in connection with NXIVM. In September 2018, daughter Sara was named the defendant in a 2018 class-action suit regarding her NXIVM activities.\n\nBronfman died on December 21, 2013 at his home in Manhattan. He was 84. Bronfman was survived by his widow, Aronson, seven children, 24 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren at the time of his death.\n\nBronfman was a philanthropist who gave large amounts of money to Jewish causes, including , which he was credited with helping revive together with Hillel President Richard Joel in the 1990s. The Hillel at New York University is called The Edgar M. Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life, known by students just as \"Bronfman\". Bronfman established the Bronfman Youth Fellowships in Israel, a leadership program for Jewish youth, and provided the funding for MyJewishLearning.com, a digital media entity that includes Kveller, a popular Jewish parenting site.\n\nHis mother has a concert hall named after her in Montreal, the Saidye Bronfman Centre, and a building at McGill University is named after his father.\n\nBronfman was also the Founder and President of The Samuel Bronfman Foundation, whose work is informed by these four principles: \"Jewish renaissance is grounded in Jewish learning, Jewish youth shape the future of the Jewish people, vibrant Jewish communities are open and inclusive, and that all Jews are a single family.\"\n\nMajor points of focus for The Samuel Bronfman Foundation are pluralism, intermarriage, community engagement – especially youth – and making Jewish knowledge accessible to Jews of all backgrounds. It is known for its work with the following grantees:\n\n\nIn April 2012, Bronfman joined the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Giving Pledge, a long-term charitable initiative that aims to inspire conversations about philanthropy and increase charitable giving in the United States. Bronfman and 12 others joined the 68 billionaires who had already signed the giving pledge.\n\nFollowing his death in 2013, Jewish news outlets called Bronfman a \"prince of his people,\" for his unique combination of lineage, intrigue, and devotion to the Jewish people through learning and philanthropy. Through his Jewish philanthropy, Bronfman became known for his unique approach to Jewish life. A proud Jew who publicly stated his disbelief in God, Bronfman developed his own understanding of Judaism, as he learned Jewish texts and traditions both in his personal life and in his work at The Samuel Bronfman Foundation. In an article, journalist Ami Eden writes about Bronfman, who chose to incorporate meaningful Jewish traditions into his life, all the while continuing to educate himself about the religion until his final days.\nBronfman also promoted the idea that Jewish organizations needed to stop using fear as a selling point, but rather encourage ordinary Jews to take a deeper interest in the substantive heritage they have been born to. Specifically, while much of the American Jewish community saw intermarriage as an epidemic to be curbed, Bronfman considered the trend an opportunity for Jews to learn further with their non-Jewish partners.\n\nIn 1986 Bronfman was honored with the Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honour), from the Government of France.\n\nBronfman was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by U.S. President Bill Clinton in August 1999 and the Star of People's Friendship by East German leader Erich Honecker in October 1988.\n\nIn 2000, he received the Leo Baeck Medal for his humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice, and in 2005 received the Hillel Renaissance Award.\n\n\nBronfman was a guest blogger for \"The Huffington Post\" and a regular contributor to \"The Washington Post\".\n\nBronfman also made many appearances on the Charlie Rose Show.\n\nThe following are video and press interviews of Edgar M. Bronfman:\n\nThe following is a video of the memorial service held for Edgar M. Bronfman on January 28, 2014 at Lincoln Center.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14305450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14305450", "title": "Employers' Association of Greater Chicago", "text": "Employers' Association of Greater Chicago\n\nThe Employers' Association of Greater Chicago (EA) was a nonprofit association of employers based in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded as the Employers' Association of Chicago in 1903, although it was also known colloquially as the Chicago Employers' Association. Its goal was to oppose the unionization of companies in the Chicago area, and assist unionized companies in deunionization.\n\nOver time, the organization's commitment to union avoidance lessened greatly and the organization became more heavily involved in traditional human resources training and consulting. The organization changed its name to the Employers' Association of Greater Chicago in 1959, and merged with the Midwest Industrial Management Association in 1981.\n\nThe group was founded as the Employers' Association of Chicago (the EA) in 1902 during a strike against telephone equipment manufacturers.\n\nIn January 1902, Brass Molder's Union Local 83 struck Stromberg-Carlson and Western Electric, seeking to win the closed shop in collective bargaining negotiations. The employers locked out the workers and brought in strikebreakers. Union members began attacking the strikebreakers. On May 7, 1903, the union struck the Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company. Kellogg Switchboard, too, locked out 90 percent of its workforce and hired strikebreakers. The Teamsters Joint Council of Chicago began a sympathy strike on June 24, 1903. The three employers sought injunctions against the sympathy strike, which they won on July 20, 1903. The Brass Molders' strike collapsed soon afterward.\n\nDuring the summer of 1902, the Employers' Association of Chicago was formed. John G. Shedd, vice-president of Marshall Field & Company, was the primary force behind the organization of the group. Shedd became the first president. Montgomery Ward manager (later president) Robert J. Thorne was the first vice-president; grocery store president Frank H. Armstrong of Reid, Murdoch & Company the second vice-president; and William E. Clow, president of plumbing manufacturer J.B. Clow & Co. Its goal was to secure the open shop, resist unionization, and break unions in workplaces where they existed. The group kept its membership secret for fear of generating strikes by the Teamsters. By the end of the year, the EA's existence had become public knowledge and the organization had hired its first staff person, former labor arbitrator Frederick W. Job. The EA was heavily funded by the city's banks, and by other large companies such as Rand McNally.\n\nThe EA took its first active role in a labor dispute during the 1902-03 telephone equipment strike. The Teamsters and team owners had formed a body known as the Chicago Board of Arbitration (CBA) in early 1903. Ostensibly, the CBA was established to mediate disputes between drivers and their employers. But the CBA quickly asserted jurisdiction over all labor disputes in the city. The Teamsters could force employers to the table by striking, where the team owners would win decisions which enabled them to profit at the expense of other business owners. When the CBA attempted to intervene in the telephone equipment strike, the EA retaliated. The EA threw its entire support behind Kellogg Switchboard, which subsequently refused to bargain with the union. The EA also supplied funds and legal expertise which enabled Kellogg Switchboard to win a court injunction forcing the Teamsters to end their sympathy strike. These actions helped break the strike.\n\nThe Teamsters quickly became the biggest target of the EA. In early 1904, the Teamsters aligned all their contracts to expire simultaneously on May 1, 1905. The EA then passed a resolution on June 16, 1904, declaring that no employer would sign a contract with the Teamsters after May 1, 1905.\n\nThe EA's biggest anti-union push came in 1905. On December 15, 1904, 19 clothing cutters at Montgomery Ward went on strike to protest the company's use of nonunion subcontractors. The Montgomery Ward quickly locked them out. Sympathy strikes by several tailors' unions broke out, as did sympathy strikes by other unions. By April, 5,000 workers were on the picket line. The Teamsters engaged in a sympathy strike on April 6, 1905, adding another 10,000 members to the strike. The EA collected $250,000 (about $6.2 million in 2007 dollars) from its members to hire strikebreakers. The EA also raised $1 million (about $25 million in 2007 dollars) to establish the Employers' Teaming Association-a new company which, within a matter of weeks, bought out a large number of team owners and imported hundreds of African American strikebreakers from St. Louis to drive the wagons. Mark Morton, president of Morton Salt and an EA member, convinced the railroads to pressure the remaining team owners to lock out their Teamster members as well. The Teamsters upped the ante, and another 25,000 members walked off the job on April 25, 1905, paralyzing grocery stores, warehouses, railway shippers, department stores and coal companies. The EA and its members sued nearly every union as well. Local and state courts issued numerous injunctions against the unions, ordering them to stop picketing and return to work. When a wagon owner refused to do business with Montgomery Ward for fear that the Teamsters would picket him, a court forced the team owner to do business with the retailer. Few courts were impartial in their administration of justice. One judge seated a grand jury whose foreman was A. A. McCormick, the reactionary publisher of the \"Chicago Evening Post\".\n\nThe strike ended not through the efforts of the EA or the unions, but due to the allegations of John C. Driscoll. In June 1905, the grand jury led by foreman McCormick heard testimony by Driscoll, who at the time was secretary of the team owners' association. Driscoll claimed that he had taken at least $10,000 in bribes from Thorne and executives at other companies to force the unions out on strike. Driscoll also alleged that the Teamsters and other unions had demanded bribes to end the strike, and that Driscoll had skimmed portions of these bribes into his own pocket. $50,000 in cancelled checks were produced in court to support Driscoll's claims. Although Driscoll's testimony undercut both sides, public support for the unions suffered most. Although nearly every union continued to support the strike publicly, most sent their members back to work by the end of June. The Teamsters continued to support the strike, but various divisions of the union also went back to work in June and July. By August 1, 1905, the strike was over and the employers ended the lockout.\n\nThe EA pressed its advantage against Chicago's unions. It added building owners as members in 1913, and supported them in their fight with the Building Service Employees International Union. It helped expose efforts to extort money from property owners in 1921, which led to the indictment and eventual imprisonment of BSEIU president William Quesse. In 1921, the EA attacked nascent unions in grocery stores and food industries, accusing them of vandalism, bombings and extortion as well. In the early and mid-1920s, the EA put pressure on unions in the city's milk and ice industries, accusing unions of blackmail, extortion, and establishing anti-competitive trusts and price fixing.\n\nThe focus on illegal activities by unions proved so effective that the EA's main priority became attacking labor racketeering. The term \"racketeering\" was, in fact, coined by the Employers' Association of Chicago in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the Teamsters union. Reports about rackets and other illegal activities by labor unions and employers were issued annually by the EA. In 1928, for example, the Employers' Association claimed that exactly 46 rackets were operating in Chicago. The EA reported on the use of thugs and gunmen by both unions and employers, and excoriated the public and government officials for not prosecuting rackets more often or more successfully. EA reports also focused on bombings in the city. These reports provide statistical documentation of the level of organized crime-related violence in the city (although the EA reports rarely distinguish between union- or employer-instigated violence and violence undertaken by mob-dominated unions or employers). The Association's October 1928 report, which documented an astonishing 727 bombings in Chicago in the previous year, led to the formation of the city's first arson unit.\n\nIn October 1928, Employers' Association president James W. Breen was linked to the rackets himself. Chicago police investigators alleged that Breen had helped form a battery makers' cartel, and that this trade group was shaking down non-members. Breen promptly resigned as president of the association. A year later, organized crime figures bombed Breen's home for fear that the ongoing investigation might lead to Breen's indictment and that he might inform on his associates. But Breen was never indicted, however.\n\nThe Employers' Association made its first foray into legislative lobbying in 1928 as well. That year, it called for repeal of the state of Illinois' \"horse thief law,\" which permitted posses to form legally so long as they were in hot pursuit of criminals. The EA claimed that the law led citizens and employers to mistakenly believe gangs of union members were legal deputies when they were not. Three months later, the Association campaigned for a new city ordinance which would ban the resale of seized weapons to the public. The sale of the guns, the EA claimed, merely put more weapons in the hands of criminals while inducing law enforcement personnel to seize the weapons of law-abiding citizens.\n\nThe Employers' Association campaign against rackets remained strong through 1935. In 1929, the EA issued a report estimating the costs of racketeering in the city of Chicago at $136 million a year (about $1.6 billion in 2007 dollars). In August 1929, the Association reported 67 bombings in the past year, compared to 46 in 1928. The organization also posted a $5,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of any bomber, and a $1,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of any racketeer who assaulted an Employers' Association member. The bombing campaign only intensified, however, with another 30 bombings in August and September 1929. In 1931, the Association went public with a report which estimated the cost of bombings at $500 million ($6.8 billion in 2007 dollars), and the cost of racketeering at $145 million ($1.9 billion in 2007 dollars). By 1932, the Employers' Association was claiming that the bombings and rackets cost the city more than the taxes it paid to fight World War I. Whether the EA's anti-racketeering campaign had any effect is unclear. The Great Depression had caused union membership to drop significantly, and the end of Prohibition in the United States largely ended organized crime's primary motive for engaging in widespread violence. But the EA campaign had also led to strengthened anti-racketeering laws and stronger enforcement as well. By 1934, the number of bombings had dropped to their lowest since 1923.\n\nThe passage of the National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) in 1935 energized the Employers' Association, and drew it into a new field of activity. Although the EA had long opposed collective bargaining, federal legislation protecting labor unions took the organization by surprise. The Association vociferously attacked President Franklin D. Roosevelt's labor policies. But like many employers, the EA took a \"wait and see\" attitude until the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled on the Wagner Act's constitutionality. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute in 1937 in \"National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation\" 301 U.S. 1 (1937). The EA rarely attacked the act for the remainder of the 1930s or during World War II.\n\nHowever, in the post-war period it once more blasted unions and the federal government's labor policies. The EA undertook a campaign to influence Congressional opinion, and pushed strongly for repeal of the Wagner Act. When repeal seemed out of reach, the EA supported the Taft-Hartley Act and the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). It also sponsored a program to take advantage of the provisions of both acts by bolstering the role foremen played in the workplace.\n\nBy the late 1930s, labor-related disruptions and violence in Chicago had been greatly reduced. Chicago law enforcement was also cracking down heavily on labor violence and racketeering, which won high praise from the Employers' Association.\n\nThe Association became much less active in labor relations in the 1950s and 1960s. The organization undertook a brief resurgence of interested in rackets in 1951, however. It attacked the Chicago Retail Druggists Association for \"forcing\" pharmacies to pay dues to the group, accused the restaurant workers' union of extorting money from cafes, threatened to sue the Teamsters union for violations of the LMRDA, and more. It even went so far as to hire a former FBI agent, Frederick W. Turner, Jr., to investigate labor racketeering in the city. But none of these campaigns had the impact of its 1920 efforts, and Turner's investigations produced next to nothing. No indictments or grand jury investigations occurred, either. By November 1951, the EA dropped its pretense of \"fair play\" and announced it openly opposed unionization of every workplace. But this militaristic stand did little to revive the group.\n\nThe EA tried again to focus public attention on labor racketeering in 1962. Once more, it hired an ex-FBI agent to investigate racketeering in the city of Chicago, and accused unions of using simple picketing as a means of extortion. But the legal and political climate had changed, and these efforts were often unsuccessful. In November 1964, Chicago City Council Alderman Thomas E. Keane accused the EA of anti-union bias—a charge the Association roundly denied.\n\nThe EA played a role in three more strikes, both of them affecting mechanics at auto dealerships. In 1968, the Association acted as a spokesperson for the auto dealers in their attempt to resist unionization. The mechanics unionized, and struck the auto dealers in 1975, 1978 and 1981. During each strike, the EA strongly and publicly supported the dealerships and continued to act as their primary spokesperson. But the EA played little role other than that of public relations.\n\nThe Employers' Association had engaged in its first human resources consulting in 1918. That year, it undertook a very successful campaign to encourage local businesses to hire middle-age managers with experience rather than discharge them.\n\nThe EA did little in this field, however, until the 1940s. As its anti-union campaigns flagged, the organization began to become more of a human resources consulting agency for its members. In 1941, it released its first survey of workforce needs. Some of its human resources educational efforts remained linked to its traditional anti-unionism, however. In 1942, it campaigned for a longer workweek—ostensibly to meet wartime production demands, but which also violated union demands for shorter work periods. In 1949, the group denounced fringe benefits such as health insurance, pensions, and life insurance as \"unnecessary\" and \"unwise\" and exorbitantly expensive. It also declared unemployment insurance to be too costly and unnecessary, and demanded dismantling of public welfare programs.\n\nThe EA also became involved in broader social issues. Its leadership, always concerned with the spread of collectivist ideals, denounced President Harry S. Truman as a socialist and demanded that Congress rein in the president's economic policies. The organization also attacked the publishers of elementary and junior high school textbooks for allowing \"communist\" influences.\n\nLong-time Association executive director (now president) Gordon L. Hostetter died in 1962, depriving the Employers' Association of its most active leadership. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the organization quietly worked with its members to improve their human resources capacities. It defended employers when they were accused of racial bias in the administration of employment tests. But the EA abandoned most of its anti-union programs. The organization's membership, which had hovered at the 1,000-member mark for 60 years, remained stable. But the Association became less and less of an important political and workplace player in Chicago. In 1971, EA president Roland E. Fulton was elected president of the Employer Association Group of the National Association of Manufacturers. But this was the last major role the EA played in either local or national labor relations.\n\nIn 1981, the Employers' Association of Greater Chicago (as the group was now known) merged with the Midwest Industrial Management Association. In 1989, MIMA changed its name to become the Management Association of Illinois. The group still has about 1,000 member companies, roughly half of which are in manufacturing and half in the service sector.\n\nThe known presidents of the EA are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The club itself was bought in the summer of 2012 by the Al-Hasawi family.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2012, Fawaz was president of Qadsia SC, one of the largest sporting clubs in Kuwait. His tenure was a successful one, with the club winning two Kuwait Premier League titles and two Emir Cups along with the Federation Cup and the Super Cup.\n\nOn 11 July 2012, it was announced that the Al-Hasawi family had purchased Nottingham Forest from the estate of the late Nigel Doughty.\n\nAt the time of the takeover, Forest were in a stage of considerable turmoil. The sudden death of previous chairman and benefactor Doughty had left the club in a position of financial uncertainty. The club had only narrowly avoided relegation to League One and the uncertainty over the club's fortunes had led to Forest only boasting a handful of first team players. A huge overhaul was needed and the Al-Hasawi family did not hesitate to make their mark, dismissing manager Steve Cotterill quickly and replacing him with former Forest coach Sean O'Driscoll. This was quickly followed by a considerable number of player purchases, with the club spending more than £6m bringing in a number of signings.\n\nOn 15 December 2012, Fawaz Al-Hasawi made the decision to take over the role of chairman, succeeding his cousin Omar Al-Hasawi. Following a 4–2 victory over Leeds United, and with Forest firmly involved in the Championship promotion battle, Fawaz made the surprise decision to dismiss manager O'Driscoll and replace him with former Aston Villa and Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish. On 5 February 2013, McLeish parted ways with Forest by mutual agreement and was replaced by Billy Davies.\n\nFawaz subsequently become more involved with the press, including interviews with BBC sports journalists, and even referred to Billy Davies as a possible Forest equivalent to Alex Ferguson, and spoke of Forest returning to a UEFA Champions' League level at some point in the future. However, this coincided with a significantly diminished relationship between the football side of the club and the media due to a series of media bans and restrictions imposed by Davies. In March 2014, following a poor run of results and a breakdown in the relationship between himself and Fawaz, Billy Davies became the fourth manager to be dismissed during the Al-Hazawi period of ownership.\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Davies, it was widely reported that Neil Warnock was offered the Forest manager's position, but rejected it due to Fawaz expressing an intention to interfere with team selection. It was subsequently announced that Forest's youth team coach Gary Brazil would manage the first team until the end of the 2013/14 season, and that Stuart Pearce would take over as manager on 1 July 2014. Fawaz has denied the reports that Warnock was offered the job, and that he interfered with football decisions.\n\nFollowing a protracted series of take-over discussions with John Jay Moores that failed to result in a sale of the club, Fawaz dismissed Philippe Montanier on January 14, 2017 following the 0-0 draw at Birmingham City.\n\nThe managers of Nottingham Forest during Fawaz's ownership were:\n\nIt was announced on May 18, 2017 that Nottingham Forest had been bought by the Greek investor and owner of Olympiacos, Evangelos Marinakis.\n\n"}

{"id": "39639653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39639653", "title": "Gold laundering", "text": "Gold laundering\n\nGold laundering is the process whereby illegally obtained gold is melted and recast into another form. The recasting is performed to obscure or conceal the true origin of the gold. The recast gold is then sold, thus laundering it into cash.\n\nIt may also refer to a money laundering transaction in which the exchanged good is gold.\n\nThere are several stages in the gold laundering process. The first is the acquisition of the gold, which may be from any combination of sources, at least one of which is illegal. This is then treated as scrap metal, melted, then cast into a mold. This results in a transportable ingot, gold bar or other bulk form bullion.\n\nIn some cases, there is no gold involved in the laundering scheme. Colombia reported 70 tons of gold exports for 2012 despite production of only 15 tons. This is a result of fictitious gold exports filed with the Colombian customs agency by drug cartels in order to import \"cash from international drug deals\".\n\nAcquisition of the gold occurs in many forms.\n\nSmall-scale gold mining operations, particularly those with no permits or licences, extract gold from areas unsuitable for large mining operations. Gold obtained in this fashion that is exported may not be traced or authenticated. This includes artisanal mines operated by few individuals, who then sell the gold to brokers.\nAnother form of acquisition is theft. In the 1940s, Nazi Germany forcibly obtained the possessions of Jews, sometimes in collaboration with other parties. Most victims who died in death camps and Nazi concentration camps were robbed of all valuable property by the state, which was then sold or, in the case of bullion, sent to the Reichsbank. For example, in 1945 the Hungarian Gold Train was established to transport the property of Hungarian Jews to Berlin. Once the Jews had been deported to German concentration camps, the valuables were sorted into categories such that their owners could no longer be identified. In the late 1930s and throughout World War II, Germany would increase its unofficial gold reserves by expropriating gold from foreign governments, including $223m from Belgium and $193m from the Netherlands. Some of the Nazi gold was exchanged for cash, and some deposited in financial institutions, including $316 million of the looted gold at the Swiss National Bank. Of the nearly 100 tons of gold laundered through Swiss banks, only 4 tons was returned. The Banco de Portugal, the central bank of Portugal, would regularly purchase Nazi gold held at the Swiss National Bank, according to a 1944 document from the American Overseas Special Services.\n\nThe scrap gold is then sold by brokers to smelters or refiners, who heat the gold to at least , its melting point. This may include gold from numerous sources, including recycled and newly mined gold. Once melted, it may be purified by parting, which separates out silver impurities, and the Miller process or Wohlwill process, depending on the desired level of purity and scale of operation.\n\nOnce refined, it is cast into a transportable form for further processing. Gold fingerprinting, that is identifying a particular source of gold based on its impurities or trace elements, may be possible if the impurities have not been removed via refining.\n\nTo prevent laundering of gold and other metals (such as tantalum, tin, and tungsten), some nations have established systems and regulations. For example, Rwanda introduced regulations for mineral trade that requires all ore extraction be tagged, in part a response to the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the United States that requires companies to disclose the use of conflict minerals by publishing a supply chain audit.\n\nHowever, with only 100 government monitors overseeing 450 mining sites during typical business hours, smuggling still occurs, exacerbated by corrupt monitors illegally selling tags or failing to record transactions in logbooks.\n\nIn 2013, Ghanaian president John Dramani Mahama announced that the government of Ghana would establish a task force to regulate the small-scale mining sector. This was to ensure that gold produced in small-scale mines could be authenticated, and also to eliminate the use of heavy machinery that had become prevalent on such sites, which have caused environmental damage.\n\nThe government of Uganda obtained $200 million in trade revenue from the sale of gold in 2012, but expects that to decrease in 2013 as a result of illegal mining operations.\n\nThe group InSight Crime claims that illegal mining represents up to 30% of the revenues of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).\n\nOn 22 November 2000, the World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks was settled, providing a fund of $1.25 billion for restitution to individuals whose property was confiscated by the Nazis during World War II.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19526030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19526030", "title": "Hormone replacement therapy", "text": "Hormone replacement therapy\n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT), also known as menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) or postmenopausal hormone therapy (PHT, PMHT), is a form of hormone therapy which is used to treat symptoms associated with menopause in women. These symptoms can include hot flashes, vaginal atrophy and dryness, and bone loss, among others, and are caused by diminished levels of sex hormones in the menopausal period. The main hormonal medications used in HRT for menopausal symptoms are estrogens and progestogens. A progestogen is usually used in combination with an estrogen in women with intact uteruses because unopposed estrogen therapy is associated with endometrial hyperplasia and cancer and progestogens prevent these risks. Androgens, like testosterone, are sometimes used in HRT as well. HRT medications are available in various forms and for use by a variety of different routes of administration.\n\nThe 2002 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found disparate results for all cause mortality with HRT, finding it to be lower when HRT was begun earlier, between age 50 to 59, but higher when begun after age 60. In older patients, there was an increased incidence of breast cancer, heart attacks and stroke, although a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer and bone fracture. Some of the WHI findings were again found in a larger national study done in the United Kingdom, known as the Million Women Study (MWS). As a result of these findings, the number of women taking HRT dropped precipitously. The WHI recommended that women with non-surgical menopause take the lowest feasible dose of HRT for the shortest possible time to minimize associated risks.\n\nThe current indications for use from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include short-term treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor hot flashes or vaginal atrophy, and prevention of osteoporosis. In 2012 and 2017, the United States Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that the harmful effects of combined estrogen and progestin therapy are likely to exceed the chronic disease prevention benefits in most women. A consensus expert opinion published by The Endocrine Society stated that when taken during perimenopause, or the initial years of menopause, HRT carries significantly fewer risks than previously published, and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) also released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT in appropriate clinical scenarios.\n\nHRT is used to treat or prevent menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal, perimenopausal, and surgically menopausal women, including the following:\n\n\nIt is also used for health benefits, such as reduced risk of dementia, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and others. However, this may be counterbalanced by various health risks, like an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer.\n\nHRT is often given as a short-term relief (often one or two years, usually less than five) from menopausal symptoms (such as hot flashes, irregular menstruation). Such treatments aren't usually recommended to women who are perimenopausal or for at least 12 months after the last menstrual period. Younger women with premature ovarian failure or surgical menopause may use HRT for many years, until the age that natural menopause would be expected to occur.\n\nThere are several different types of hormonal medications which are used in HRT for menopausal symptoms:\n\n\nTibolone is a unique medication which has the properties of an estrogen, progestogen, and androgen all in one molecule.\n\nThe medications used in menopausal HRT are available in numerous different formulations for use by a variety of different routes of administration:\n\n\nHRT for menopause generally provides low dosages of one or more estrogens, and usually also provides a progestogen. In women with intact uteruses, estrogens are almost always given in combination with progestogens, as long-term unopposed estrogen therapy is associated with a markedly increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. Conversely, in women who have undergone a hysterectomy or who otherwise do not have a uterus, a progestogen is not necessarily required, and an estrogen can be used alone if preferred. There are many combined formulations which include both an estrogen and a progestogen. Examples include the combination of CEEs and MPA (brand name Prempro), as well as the combination of estradiol with one of various progestins such as norethisterone (in Activelle, Novofem, Cliovelle), MPA (in Indivina), levonorgestrel, dienogest, and drospirenone, among others.\n\nDosage is often varied cyclically to more closely mimic the ovarian hormone cycle, with estrogens taken daily and progestogens taken for about two weeks every month or two; a method called \"cyclic HRT\" or \"sequentially combined HRT\" (abbreviated scHRT). An alternate method, a constant dosage with both types of hormones taken daily, is called \"continuous combined HRT\" or ccHRT, and is a more recent innovation. Vaginal estrogen can have more effect on atrophic vaginitis with fewer systemic effects than estrogens delivered by other routes. Sometimes an androgen, generally testosterone, is added to treat diminished libido. It may also treat reduced energy and help reduce osteoporosis after menopause.\n\nBioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) is the use of hormones that are chemically identical to those produced in a woman's body. Proponents of BHT claim that it can offer advantages over non-bioidentical or conventional hormone therapy (CHT). There are two different meanings to BHT as a term and therapy, which has resulted in some confusion. While both deal with the use of bioidentical hormones, one meaning concerns the specific use of certain compounded hormone preparations, usually in conjunction with blood or saliva testing to determine, and adjust, a woman's hormone levels; whereas the other meaning simply refers to the use of bioidentical hormones in general, but most typically as approved pharmaceutical preparations. The practices associated with the first meaning are not widely accepted in clinical medicine. Compounded BHT, including custom-compounded products like BiEst (20% estradiol and 80% estriol) and TriEst (10% estradiol, 10% estrone, and 80% estriol), has not demonstrated any benefits over CHT, and presents risks of uncertain dosing, potency, and possible contamination. In addition, blood or saliva testing is of limited utility due to natural fluctuations in hormone levels, and lack of consensus for ideal dosage in humans. As such, the evidence and scientific literature do not support the use of compounded BHT, with or without hormone-level testing, over CHT.\n\nConversely, the use of approved bioidentical pharmaceutical hormones, namely transdermal or vaginal estradiol and oral or vaginal progesterone, over animal-derived and synthetic hormones, like oral CEEs and oral MPA, \"is\" associated with various health advantages. Such advantages include reduced or no risk of venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular disease, and breast cancer, among others. However, less research has been conducted on bioidentical hormones relative to non-bioidentical oral hormonal medications, and there is a need for more clinical research to fully delineate some of these health advantages. In any case, as of 2012, guidelines from the North American Menopause Society, the Endocrine Society, the International Menopause Society, and the European Menopause and Andropause Society all contain positive statements in regards to the management of menopausal women with a personal or family history of venous thromboembolism with transdermal estradiol and micronized progesterone over other approaches.\n\nInstitutions and organizations such as the FDA have taken public stances on compounded BHT. The FDA has stated that compounded BHT is unsupported by medical evidence, and its administration is considered false and misleading by the agency. The FDA has expressed concern that unfounded claims of compounded hormones having advantages over CHT mislead women and health care professionals. The approved pharmaceutical preparations used in conventional therapy have been researched to quantify these risks and benefits, and are produced by manufacturers with stringent purity and potency standards.\n\nCompounding in the United Kingdom is a regulated activity. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regulates compounding performed under a Manufacturing Specials license and the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) regulates compounding performed within a pharmacy. All testosterone prescribed in the United Kingdom is bioidentical and its use is supported by the National Health Service (NHS). Marketing authorization exists for male testosterone products. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline 1.4.8 states: \"consider testosterone supplementation for menopausal women with low sexual desire if HRT alone is not effective\". The footnote adds: \"at the time of publication (November 2015), testosterone did not have a United Kingdom marketing authorisation for this indication in women. Bio-identical progesterone is used in IVF treatment and for pregnant women who are at risk of premature labour.\"\n\n\n\n\nA 2017 pooled analysis of data from five observational cohort studies in Swedish women found a reduction in risk of stroke among women who started hormone replacement therapy within five years of onset of menopause. Demographically, the vast majority of data available is in postmenopausal American women with concurrent pre-existing conditions, and with a mean age of over 60 years.\n\nThe North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2016 annual meeting mentioned that HRT may have more benefits than risks when it comes to females under the age of 60 years old.\n\nIn 2002 the WHI was published. That study looked at the effects of hormonal replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. Both age groups had a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer, and both heart attack and stroke were increased in older patients, although not in younger participants. In fact, the use of HRT in the United States has actually dropped greatly since 2002. Breast cancer was increased in women treated with estrogen and a progestin, but not with estrogen and progesterone or estrogen alone. Treatment with unopposed estrogen (i.e., an estrogen alone without a progestogen) is contraindicated if the uterus is still present, due to its proliferative effect on the endometrium. The WHI also found a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer when estrogen and a progestogen were used together, and most importantly, a reduced incidence of bone fractures. Ultimately, the study found disparate results for all cause mortality with HRT, finding it to be lower when HRT was begun during ages 50–59, but higher when begun after age 60. Some findings of the WHI were reconfirmed in a larger national study done in the United Kingdom, known as MWS. Coverage of the WHI findings led to a reduction in the number of postmenopausal women on HRT. The authors of the study recommended that women with non-surgical menopause take the lowest feasible dose of HRTHRT, and for the shortest possible time, to minimize risk.\n\nThe data published by the WHI suggested supplemental estrogen increased risk of venous emboli and breast cancer but was protective against osteoporosis and colorectal cancer, while the impact on cardiovascular disease was mixed. These results were later confirmed in trials from the United Kingdom, but not in more recent studies from France and China. Genetic polymorphism appears to be associated with inter-individual variability in metabolic response to HRT in postmenopausal women.\n\nThese recommendations have not held up with further data analysis, however. Subsequent findings released by the WHI showed that all cause mortality was not dramatically different between the groups receiving CEEs, those receiving estrogen and a progestogen, and those not on HRT at all. Specifically, the relative risk for all-cause mortality was 1.04 (confidence interval 0.88–1.22) in the CEEs-alone trial and 1.00 (CI, 0.83–1.19) in the estrogen plus progestogen trial. Further, in analysis pooling data from both trials, postmenopausal HRT was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (RR, 0.70; CI, 0.51–0.96) among women ages 50 to 59. This would represent five fewer deaths per 1,000 women per 5 years of therapy.\n\nHowever, neither the WHI nor the MWS differentiated the results for different types of progestogens used. MPA – the type most commonly used in the United States – was the only one examined by the WHI, which in its analysis and conclusions extrapolated the benefits versus risks of MPA to all progestins. This conclusion has since been challenged by several researchers as unjustified and misleading, resulting in unreasonable, unnecessary avoidance by many women of HRT. In fact, primate research indicates that the side effects of MPA may be worse than those of other progestogens, and some human studies indicate that MPA may be responsible for negating the protective cardiac benefits of estrogen that were found for estrogen-only HRT users. Critics including Bethea note that there are now research papers showing significantly better outcomes in brain, breast, and cardiovascular parameters with estradiol plus progesterone instead of MPA and conclude that further studies are needed to know more precisely what the differences in effects are when other progestins are used versus bioidentical progesterone in HRT, so that women aren't needlessly discouraged from seeking HRT.\n\nA robust Bayesian meta-analysis from 19 randomized clinical trials reported similar data with a RR of mortality of 0.73 (CI, 0.52–0.96) in women younger than age 60. However, HRT had minimal effect among those between 60 and 69 years of age (RR, 1.05; CI, 0.87–1.26) and was associated with a borderline significant increase in mortality in those between 70 and 79 years of age (RR, 1.14; CI, 0.94 –1.37; P for trend < 0.06). Similarly, in the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) trial, with participants having a mean age of 66.7 yr, HRT did not reduce in total mortality (RR, 1.08; CI, 0.84 –1.38). A 2003 meta-analysis of 30 randomized trials of HRT in relation to mortality showed that it was associated with a nearly 40% reduction in mortality in trials in which participants had a mean age of less than 60 yr or were within 10 yr of menopause onset but was unrelated to mortality in the other trials. The findings in the younger age groups were similar to those in the observational Nurses' Health Study (RR for mortality, 0.63; CI, 0.56 – 0.70).\n\nThe beneficial potential of HRT was bolstered in a consensus expert opinion published by The Endocrine Society, which stated that when taken during perimenopause or the initial years of menopause, hormonal therapy carries significantly fewer risks than previously published and reduces all cause mortality in most patient scenarios. The AACE released a position statement in 2009 that approved of HRT in the appropriate clinical scenario.\n\nProprietary mixtures of progestins and CEEs are a commonly prescribed form of HRT. As the most common and longest-prescribed type of estrogen used in HRT, most studies of HRT involve CEEs. More recently developed forms of drug delivery include suppositories, subdermal implants, skin patches and gels. They have more local effect, lower doses, fewer side effects, and result in constant rather than cyclical serum hormone levels.\n\nMenopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular activity. Menopause can be divided into early and late transition periods, also known as perimenopause and postmenopause. Each stage is marked by changes in hormonal patterns, which can induce menopausal symptoms. It is possible to induce menopause prematurely by surgically removing the ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy). This is often done as a consequence of ovarian failure, such as ovarian or uterine cancers. The most common side effects of the menopausal transition are: lack of sexual desire or libido, lack of sexual arousal, and vaginal dryness. The modification of women’s physiology can lead to changes in her sexual response, the development of sexual dysfunctions, and changes in her levels of sexual desire.\n\nIt is commonly perceived that once women near the end of their reproductive years and enter menopause that this equates to the end of her sexual life. However, especially since women today are living one third or more of their lives in a postmenopausal state, maintaining, if not improving, their quality of life, of which their sexuality can be a key determinant, is of importance. A recent study of sexual activities among women aged 40–69 revealed that 75% of women are sexually active at this age; this indicates that the sexual health and satisfaction of menopausal women are an aspect of sexual health and quality of life that is worthy of attention by health care professionals.\n\nA major complaint among postmenopausal women is decreased libido, and many may seek medical consultation for this. Several hormonal changes take place during the menopausal period, including a decrease in estrogen levels and an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone. For most women, the majority of change occurs during the late perimenopausal and postmenopausal stages. Decrease in other hormones such as the sex hormone-binding globulim (SHBG) and inhibin (A and B) also take place in the postmenopausal period. Testosterone, a hormone more commonly associated with males, is also present in women. It peaks at age 30, but declines with age, so there is little variation across the lifetime and during the menopausal transition. However, in surgically induced menopause, instead of the levels of estrogens and testosterone slowly declining over time, they decline very sharply, resulting in more severe symptoms.\n\nIn menopausal women, sexual functioning can impact several dimensions of a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being. During the onset of menopause, sexuality can be a critical issue in determining whether one begins to experience changes in their sexual response cycle. Both age — and menopause-related events can affect the integrity of a woman’s biological systems involved in the sexual response cycle, which include hormone environment, neuro-muscular substrates, and vascular supplies. Therefore, it can be appropriate to make use of HRT, especially in women with low or declining quality of life due to sexual difficulties.\n\nCurrent research that has examined the impact of menopause on women’s self-reported sexual satisfaction indicates that 50.3% of women experience some sexual disturbance in one of five domains, and 33.7% experience disturbances in two of the domains. Of these were desire, orgasm, lubrication, and arousal disturbances. With regards to arousal, they found a significant negative association between age and arousal, in that as women aged they were more likely to report lower arousal scores. In the desire and orgasm domains, 38% of women reported a disturbances in their desire, and 17% reported a disturbance in their orgasm capabilities; of the 17%, 14% were premenopausal, 15.2% were postmenopausal and taking a form of HRT, and 22% were postmenopausal not on a form of HRT. Eight percent of women reported disturbances lubricating during sexual activity; 14.3% in the premenopausal group, 30% in the postmenopausal group not using a HRT, and 11.7% among those postmenopausal women using HRT. Lastly, 21% of women reported pain as a disturbance in their sexual satisfaction — the premenopausal group at 14.3%, the postmenopausal women using HRT at 13.3% and the group with the highest rates, similarly to the other results, was the postmenopausal women not taking HRT at 34%. This study concluded that there was a significant decline in sexual function related to menopause in the pain and lubrication domains.\n\nThe maintenance and improvement of quality of life during the menopausal period is at the core of estrogen and progestogen-based HRT. Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. Dyspareunia (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT. It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity. Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted. However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use. A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone. Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone — a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties — suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed. However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.\n\nThe goal of HRT is to mitigate discomfort caused by diminished circulating estradiol and progesterone in menopause. In those with premature or surgically induced menopause, a combination HRT is often recommended, as it may also prolong life and may decrease a woman's chances of developing endometrial cancers associated with unopposed estrogen therapy, as well by decreasing the incidence of dementia. The main hormones involved are estrogens and progestogens. Some recent therapies include the use of androgens as well.\n\nData from numerous studies have consistently found that HRT leads to improvements in aspects of postmenopausal sexual dysfunction. Sexuality is a critical aspect of quality of life for the large majority of menopausal women; therefore, any features of the menopausal transition that can negatively affect a woman’s sexuality have the ability to significantly alter her quality of life. The most prevalent of female sexual dysfunctions linked to menopause include lack of desire and low libido, both of which can be explained by changes in hormonal physiology.\n\nImprovements in sexual pain, vaginal lubrication and orgasm are found to be statistically different from those using HRT. Estrogens have positive effects of mood, sexual function, target end organs, and cognitive function.\n\nComparisons between orally administered pill and transdermal patch suggests that when estrogens are taken orally the risks of thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism are increased, an effect which is not seen with topical administration. Transdermal and transvaginal administration are not subject to first pass metabolism, and so lack the anabolic effects that oral therapy has on hepatic synthesis of Vitamin K dependent clotting factors. This effect refers only to patches for HRT, which contain estradiol, not those used in oral contraceptive therapy, which contain ethinylestradiol. The latter is associated with an increased incidence of venous clot. The WHI also showed an increased incidence arterial disease, namely stroke, in patients who began HRT after the age of 65, although this effect was not significantly present in those who began therapy during their fifth decade.\n\nThe impact of HRT on cardiovascular morbidity is a subject of much controversy in the medical literature. The reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with HRT, reported in observational studies, has not been subsequently confirmed in randomized clinical trials. The increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the WHI was not statistically significant, and only found in the oldest women, and those who started HRT late after menopause began. The increase in risks of coronary heart disease in the treatment arm of the study varied according to age and years since onset of menopause. Women aged 50 to 59 using HRT showed a trend towards lower risk of coronary heart disease, as did women who were within five years of the onset of menopause.\n\nA Cochrane review came to the result that in women starting HRT less than 10 years after menopause have a lower mortality and lower rate of coronary heart disease compared to placebo or no treatment, without any strong evidence of an effect on the risk of stroke. Those starting therapy more than 10 years after menopause have little effect on mortality and coronary heart disease, but have an increased risk of stroke. Overall, however, taking the increased risk of venous thromboembolism into account, it came to the conclusion that has HRT has little if any benefit for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe adverse cardiovascular outcomes may only apply to oral dosing with CEEs and progestins in oral systemic therapy, while transdermal estradiol and estriol may not produce the same risks, due to the absence of anabolic effects of hepatic vitamin K dependent clotting factors.\n\nOn a molecular level, HRT at the time of menopause has effects on the lipid profile. Specifically, HDL decreases, while LDL, triglycerides and lipoprotein a increase. Supplemental estrogen improves the lipid profile by reversing each of these effects. Beyond this, it improves cardiac contractility, coronary artery blood flow, metabolism of carbohydrates, and decreases platelet aggregation and plaque formation. At the molecular level HRT may promote reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) via the induction of cholesterol ABC transporters.\n\nWhile combined estrogen–progestogen supplementation has been linked to an increased incidence of endometrial cancer, the specific subtype is usually stage I, or \"in situ\", and has extremely low morbidity and mortality, and studies in American women have shown the tumor to not have propensity for growth into the myometrium or parametrial soft tissues. When seen in the context of all cause mortality, women who take estrogen and develop endometrial cancer have higher survival rates than women who do not take hormonal therapy at all, which was due to the preventive effect of HRT on hip fractures.\n\nUnopposed estrogen can also result in endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to endometrial cancer. The extensive use of high-dose estrogens for birth control in the 1970s is thought to have resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of this type of cancer.\n\nHRT is effective at reversing the effects of aging on muscle.\n\nAccording to a 2007 presentation at an American Academy of Neurology meeting, HRT taken soon after menopause may help protect against dementia, but it raises the risk of mental decline in women who do not take HRT until they are older. Dementia risk was 1% in women who started HRT early, and 1.7% in women who didn't, (i.e. women who didn't take HRT seem to have had — on average — a 70% higher relative risk of dementia than women who began HRT around the time of the beginning of menopause). This suggests that there may be a \"critical period\" during which time taking HRT may have benefits, but if HRT is initiated after that period, it will not have such benefits and may cause harm. This is consistent with research that HRT improves executive and attention processes in postmenopausal women. It is also supported by research upon monkeys that were given ovariectomies to imitate the effect of menopause and then estrogen therapies. This showed replacement treated compared to nontreated monkeys had long term improved prefrontal cortex executive abilities on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.\n\nThe relative risk (RR) of breast cancer varies from 1.24 in the WHI study to 1.66 in the MWS, with results differing according to interval between menopause and HRT and methods of HRT. The WHI preliminary results in 2004 found a non-significant trend in the estrogen-alone clinical trial towards a reduced risk of breast cancer and a 2006 update concluded that use of estrogen-only HRT for 7 years does not increase the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. The results of the WHI estrogen-alone trial suggest that the progestin used in the WHI estrogen-plus-progestin trial increased the risk for breast cancer above that associated with estrogen alone. HRT has been more strongly associated with risk of breast cancer in women with low or normal body mass index (BMI) of less than 25, but no association has been observed in women with a high body mass index.\n\nResearch has found that increased breast cancer risk applies only to those women who take progestins, but not to those taking bioidentical progesterone itself, nor to hysterectomized women who take estrogen alone. It has been suggested by some that the absence of effect in these studies could be due to selective prescription to overweight women, or to the very low progesterone serum levels after oral administration leading to a strong tumor inactivation rate.\n\nFor women who previously have had breast cancer, it is recommended to first consider other options for menopausal effects, such as bisphosphonates or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for osteoporosis, cholesterol-lowering agents and aspirin for cardiovascular disease, and vaginal estrogen for local symptoms. Observational studies of systemic HRT after breast cancer are generally reassuring. If HRT is necessary after breast cancer, estrogen-only therapy or estrogen therapy with a progestogen may be safer options than combined systemic therapy.\n\nEstrogen prevents the activity of osteoclasts, and improves bone mineral density. Hip fracture is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older females, and usually does not occur in the setting of osteoporosis. Estrogen is the only medical therapy that has been shown to prevent hip fractures in women that are not osteoporotic, with efficacy superior to bisphosphonates or calcium and vitamin D supplementation.\n\nA 2015 meta-analysis found that HRT was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. The authors concluded that if this association is causal, women using HRT have about one additional case of ovarian cancer per 1,000 users.\n\nHRT appears to slow down the biological/epigenetic aging rate of buccal cells but not that of blood cells. Conversely, the unmitigated loss of hormones resulting from menopause accelerates the biological aging rate of blood according to a molecular biomarker of aging known as epigenetic clock.\n\nThe extraction of CEEs from the urine of pregnant mares led to the marketing in 1942 of Premarin, one of the earlier forms of estrogen to be introduced. From that time until the mid-1970s, estrogen was administered without a supplemental progestogen. Studies in the 1975 and thereafter demonstrated that in the absence of a progestogen, unopposed estrogen therapy with Premarin resulted in an 8-fold increased risk of endometrial cancer. After this, sales of Premarin plummeted for a few years. However, it was shown by the early 1980s that the addition of a progestogen to estrogen therapy could mitigate the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with intact uteruses. This led to the development of combined estrogen–progestogen therapy who had not undergone hysterectomy, most typically with a combination of Premarin and Provera (CEEs and MPA, respectively), and in the birth of the modern concept of what is referred to as \"hormone replacement therapy\".\n\nThe WHI trials were conducted between 1991 and 2004. However, the arm of the WHI receiving combined estrogen and progestin therapy was closed prematurely in 2002 by its Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) due to perceived health risks, although the trial arm was stopped only a full year after the data suggesting increased risk became manifest. In 2004, the arm of the WHI in which post-hysterectomy patients were being treated with estrogen alone was also closed by the DMC.\n\nClinical medical practice changed based upon two parallel Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies of HRT. Prior studies were smaller, and many were of women who electively took hormonal therapy. The WHI studies were the first large, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of HRT in healthy women.\n\nOne portion of the parallel studies followed over 16,000 women for an average of 5.2 years, half of whom took placebo, while the other half took a combination of CEEs and MPA (Prempro).\n\nThis WHI estrogen-plus-progestin trial was stopped prematurely in 2002 because preliminary results suggested risks of combined CEEs and progestins exceeded their benefits. The first report on the halted WHI estrogen-plus-progestin study came out in July 2002.\n\nThe study reported statistically significant increases in rates of breast cancer, coronary heart disease, strokes and pulmonary emboli. The study also found statistically significant decreases in rates of hip fracture and colorectal cancer. \"A year after the study was stopped in 2002, an article was published indicating that estrogen plus progestin also increases the risks of dementia.\" The conclusion of the study was that the HRT combination presented risks that outweighed its measured benefits. The results were almost universally reported as risks and problems associated with HRT in general, rather than with Prempro, the specific proprietary combination of CEEs and MPA studied.\n\nAfter the increased clotting found in the first WHI results was reported in 2002, the number of Prempro prescriptions filled reduced by almost half. Following the WHI results, a large percentage of HRT users opted out of them, which was quickly followed by a sharp drop in breast cancer rates. The decrease in breast cancer rates has continued in subsequent years. An unknown number of women started taking alternatives to Prempro, such as compounded bioidentical hormones, though researchers have asserted that compounded hormones are not significantly different from conventional hormone therapy.\n\nThe other portion of the parallel studies featured women who were post hysterectomy so who consequently did not need to take a progestogen when using estrogen. They were given either placebo or CEEs alone. This group did not show the risks demonstrated in the combination hormone study, and the estrogen-only study was not halted in 2002. However, in February 2004 it, too, was halted. While there was a 23% decreased incidence of breast cancer in the estrogen-only study participants, risks of stroke and pulmonary embolism were increased slightly, predominantly in patients who began HRT over the age of 60.\n\nThe WHI trial was limited by low adherence, high attrition, inadequate power to detect risks for some outcomes, and evaluation of few regimens. The double blinding limited validity of study results due to its effects on patient exclusion criteria. Patients who were experiencing symptoms of the menopausal transition were excluded from the study, meaning that younger women who had only recently experienced menopause were not significantly represented. As a result, while the average age of menopause is age 51, study participants were on average 62 years of age. Demographically, the vast majority were Caucasian, and tended to be slightly overweight and former smokers.\n\nWyeth, now a subsidiary of Pfizer, was a pharmaceutical company that marketed the HRT products Premarin (CEEs) and Prempro (CEEs + MPA). In 2009, litigation involving Wyeth resulted in the release of 1,500 documents that revealed practices concerning its promotion of these medications. The documents showed that Wyeth commissioned dozens of ghostwritten reviews and commentaries that were published in medical journals in order to promote unproven benefits of its HRT products, downplay their harms and risks, and cast competing therapies in a negative light. Starting in the mid-1990s and continuing for over a decade, Wyeth pursued an aggressive \"publication plan\" strategy to promote its HRT products through the use of ghostwritten publications. It worked mainly with DesignWrite, a medical writing firm. Between 1998 and 2005, Wyeth had 26 papers promoting its HRT products published in scientific journals.\n\nThese favorable publications emphasized the benefits and downplayed the risks of its HRT products, especially the \"misconception\" of the association of its products with breast cancer. The publications defended unsupported cardiovascular \"benefits\" of its products, downplayed risks such as breast cancer, and promoted off-label and unproven uses like prevention of dementia, Parkinson's disease, vision problems, and wrinkles. In addition, Wyeth emphasized negative messages against the SERM raloxifene for osteoporosis, instructed writers to stress the fact that \"alternative therapies have increased in usage since the WHI even though there is little evidence that they are effective or safe...\", called into question the quality and therapeutic equivalence of approved generic CEE products, and made efforts to spread the notion that the unique risks of CEEs and MPA were a class effect of all forms of menopausal HRT: \"Overall, these data indicate that the benefit/risk analysis that was reported in the Women's Health Initiative can be generalized to all postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy products.\"\n\nIn any case, following the publication of the WHI data in 2002, the stock prices for the pharmaceutical industry plummeted, and huge numbers of women stopped using HRT. The stocks of Wyeth, which supplied the Premarin and Prempro that were used in the WHI trials, decreased by more than 50%, and never fully recovered. After the publication of the WHI data, Wyeth and other pharmaceutical companies commissioned ghostwritten publications that downplayed the findings of the trials. These articles promoted themes such as the following: \"the WHI was flawed; the WHI was a controversial trial; the population studied in the WHI was inappropriate or was not representative of the general population of menopausal women; results of clinical trials should not guide treatment for individuals; observational studies are as good as or better than randomized clinical trials; animal studies can guide clinical decision-making; the risks associated with hormone therapy have been exaggerated; the benefits of hormone therapy have been or will be proven, and the recent studies are an aberration.\" Similar findings were observed in a 2010 analysis of 114 editorials, reviews, guidelines, and letters by five industry-paid authors. These publications promoted positive themes and challenged and criticized unfavorable trials such as the WHI and MWS. In 2009, Wyeth was acquired by Pfizer in a deal valued at US$68 billion. Pfizer, a company that produces Provera and Depo-Provera (MPA) and has also engaged in medical ghostwriting, continues to market Premarin and Prempro, which remain best-selling medications.\n\nAccording to Fugh-Berman (2010), \"Today, despite definitive scientific data to the contrary, many gynecologists still believe that the benefits of [HRT] outweigh the risks in asymptomatic women. This non-evidence–based perception may be the result of decades of carefully orchestrated corporate influence on medical literature.\" Indeed, as many as 50% of physicians have expressed skepticism to the results of large trials like the WHI and HERS. The positive perceptions of many physicians of HRT in spite of large trials showing risks that potentially outweigh any benefits may be due to the efforts of pharmaceutical companies like Wyeth.\n\n\n"}

It has over 150,000 members. Over 15,000 of these members live and work outside the UK. In 2015, 8,256 students joined ICAEW – the highest ever figure. 80 of FTSE 100 (the leading UK) companies have an ICAEW Chartered Accountant on the board.\n\nThe Institute is a member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB), formed in 1974 by the major accountancy professional bodies in the UK and Ireland. The fragmented nature of the accountancy profession in the UK is in part due to the absence of any legal requirement for an accountant to be a member of one of the many Institutes, as the term \"accountant\" does not have legal protection. However, a person must belong to the ICAEW, ICAS or CAI to hold themselves out as a \"chartered accountant\" in the UK (although there are other chartered bodies of British qualified accountants whose members are likewise authorised to conduct restricted work such as auditing).\n\nThe ICAEW has two offices in the United Kingdom; the main one is Chartered Accountants' Hall in Moorgate, London and the other in Central Milton Keynes, in the complex. It also has offices in Belgium (Europe Region), China (Greater China Region), Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates (Middle East, Africa and South East Asia Region).\n\nUntil the mid-nineteenth century the role of accountants in England and Wales was restricted to that of bookkeepers in that accountants merely maintained records of what other business people had purchased and sold. However, with the growth of the limited liability company and large scale manufacturing and logistic in Victorian Britain a demand was created for more technically proficient accountants to deal with the increasing complexity of accounting transactions dealing with depreciation of assets, inventory valuation and the Companies legislation being introduced.\n\nTo improve their status and combat criticism of low standards, accountants in the cities of Britain formed professional bodies. The ICAEW was formed from the five of these associations that existed in England prior to its establishment by Royal Charter in May 1880.\n\n\nThe headquarter of the Institute, Chartered Accountants' Hall, in the City of London, was designed in the Italian Renaissance style by John Belcher in 1890. It was built by Colls & Sons. It is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of Victorian Baroque architecture. Sir William Whitfield designed the 1964–70 extension and new entrance.\n\nIn 1948, the institute received a Supplemental Charter. In 1957, the ICAEW merged with the Society of Incorporated Accountants (founded in 1885 as the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors).\n\nIn 2005 the ICAEW sought to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA). However, this project proved unsuccessful, and wasted a considerable amount of money. The Institute also announced at this time that it was considering dropping the reference to England and Wales in its title to become the Institute of Chartered Accountants. However, this plan was also withdrawn following objections from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.\n\nThe Institute introduced a new syllabus in 2007. In order to make it more appealing to prospective students the mandatory examinations will become more flexible based on a modular structure. In addition to paper based assessments, there are now computer based assessments of objective test questions (multiple choice).\n\nIn 2017, ICAEW launched a new brand identity - 'A world of strong economies', with an updated logo and brand positioning.\n\nTo be admitted to membership of the ICAEW, applicants must generally complete 450 days of relevant work experience (training) and pass a series of examinations. During the training, the candidate will also need to display professional ethics and skepticism along with showing a commitment towards continuous professional development, which must be maintained even once the qualification has been obtained. This pathway is defined as the ACA qualification. It is common for accountancy employers in the UK, such as the Big Four, to offer the ACA as part of their training contract for new joiners.\n\nThe work experience lasts between three and five years and must be with an employer or employers approved by the Institute for training; there are more than 2,850 authorised employers around the world. The examinations are in three stages. The certificate level consists of six modules examined via e-assessments; the professional stage consists of six written papers while the advanced stage, usually taken on the final year of training, consists of two technical integration papers and a case study.\n\nSince 2014, the ICAEW has been offering in parallel with the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) a joint ACA/CTA route which allows tax students to achieve both prestigious qualifications in a shorter length of time.\n\nThe full ACA training programme is also available in Cyprus, Greece, Malaysia, Mauritius, Romania and the Gulf states.\n\nMembers of equivalent bodies in other European Economic Area countries and Switzerland may also be admitted to membership after passing an aptitude test, provided they are a citizen of an EEA state or Switzerland.\n\nThe Institute has mutual recognition agreements in place with:\n\nStarting from 8 January 2010, ICAEW introduced a new \"Pathways to Membership\" programme whereby it offers the ACA designation on passing its Examination of Experience and sponsorship by ICAEW member or under ICAEW's ATE training environment, to members (qualified through normal examination and training route) of the following accounting institutes:\n\n\nHowever, AICPA and MICPA members who join the ICAEW under the Pathways to Membership scheme must maintain their home body membership.\n\nICAEW has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with accounting bodies in overseas countries. These bodies are The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB), Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore (ICPAS). There is also a joint scheme in place to enable members of the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CICPA) \nand the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants to qualify as ACA with ICAEW.\nICAEW is an affiliate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean.\n\nMembers have the designation ACA (Associate Chartered Accountant) or FCA (Fellow Chartered Accountant) after their name.\n\nFellowship is intended to designate those who have achieved a higher level of professional experience. It is awarded on application, and at no additional cost, to those members who have attained at least ten years of membership and who, at the date of application, have complied with the Institute's requirements on continuing professional development in the preceding three years and have no outstanding disciplinary charges against them.\n\nThe ICAEW has seven faculties, each run by an in-house team working together with members who are experts in their particular sector:\n\n\nThe Tax Faculty was the first to be formed in 1990; The monthly TAXline publication started in 1991, and an annual Technical\nReview (now Tax Planning) was first published in October 1992. The Tax Faculty joined the Confédération Fiscale Européenne (CFE) in 2001.\n\nThe Institute has 25 district societies, the largest of which is the London Society of Chartered Accountants (LSCA) with over 31,000 members. The LSCA has often taken the lead in making proposals for change, and was instrumental in the formation of the influential Hundred Group of finance directors.\n\n\n"}

At the age of 23 he founded his first company, \"Molteno & Co.\", a trading company that exported wine, wool and aloes to Mauritius and the West Indies, and opened branches around the Cape.\n\nIn 1841, he undertook Southern Africa’s first experimental export of fruit, loading a ship with a range of fruits (necessarily dried, as no refrigeration existed yet) and sending it to Australia to test foreign markets.\n\nThe experiment ended in disaster when his ship was wrecked in a storm - pushing Molteno close to bankruptcy.\nDisposing of the remains of his mercantile businesses, he immediately bought some land in the arid Beaufort area and successfully introduced Saxon Merino sheep, building up the vast Nelspoort Estate. Among his many other business ventures, he founded the region's first bank, \"Alport & Co.\" – in Beaufort West.\n\nHe also returned briefly to Cape Town to marry a young woman named Maria, whom he had originally met soon after arriving in South Africa. She was the coloured daughter of a merchant colleague, and he brought her back to his estate, with a view to starting a family.\n\nTragedy struck a few years later when his wife died in childbirth (along with their only child). Soon afterwards the bereaved Molteno left his estate and joined a Boer Commando that was heading for the frontier mountains to fight in the 1846 Amatola War.\n\nThe Cape economy was in a recession in the early 1860s when Molteno moved back to Cape Town, remarried and bought Claremont house (At the time an estate of orchards and vineyards, not the busy suburb that it is today).\n\nMolteno had been elected to the Cape Colony's first parliament in 1854, representing Beaufort, the first municipality in southern Africa. However, in spite of the elected parliament, executive power remained firmly in the hands of a British Governor, appointed by London, meaning that the country was run primarily according to Britain's interests, rather than southern Africa's. Molteno's experiences fighting in the frontier wars had given him a contempt for what he saw as the incompetence and injustice of British imperial rule in Southern Africa, as well as a lifelong belief in the need for efficient and locally-accountable democracy. From his first entry into parliament, he therefore began a long political battle to make the Cape's Executive democratically accountable (or \"responsible\" as it was known), and thus to give the country a degree of independence from Britain.\n\nOver the years his Responsible Government movement grew, and eventually dominated parliament and Cape politics. In the 1860s the autocratic British Governor Edmond Wodehouse made repeated attempts to dismantle the few elected bodies the Cape had, and assume direct control over the colony. Molteno led the fight against these measures, using his electoral control to cut off the Governor's budget and effectively starve his administration into compliance. After nearly a decade of struggle, the defeated Governor was recalled in 1870, amid great local celebration.\nFinally in 1872, with the consent of the new Governor Sir Henry Barkly, Molteno saw the decisive bill through parliament and brought the Cape Colony's government under local control for the first time.\n\nAfter first offering the post to Saul Solomon and William Porter, Molteno agreed to become the Cape Colony's first Prime Minister.\n\nHe was appointed Prime Minister in 1872, and in turn appointed the young John X. Merriman as his commissioner of public works (Merriman himself was later to become the 8th Prime Minister of the Cape and in that capacity continued many of Molteno's policies).\n\nMolteno began his ministry by re-organising the state finances. One of his government's first acts was to abolish the controversial house tax (Act 11 of 1872). He used the new revenues from the diamond and ostrich feather industries to pay off the Cape's accumulated debts and to invest heavily in infrastructure, including a telegraph system and an ambitious railway building programme. He also oversaw a revival in the agricultural sector, and began the construction of a vast irrigation system across the country. The economy recovered, as new ports and shipping services helped the surge in exports, resulting in reasonable budget surpluses by the end of his tenure. He led the (now prosperous) Cape colony in the Ninth Frontier War when it broke out in 1877, and he strongly resisted regional factionalism – going to great lengths to heal the rifts between the eastern and western halves of the Cape and blocking attempts by his political opponents to racially segregate the armed forces.<br> His government also founded the University of the Cape of Good Hope, now one of the world's mega-universities with over 200,000 students, and Victoria College (later to become Stellenbosch University). In 1874 he established a system of government grants to build libraries in towns and villages across the country. Later known as the \"Molteno Regulations\", they were an immense success and were later adopted by neighbouring countries.\n\nThe Molteno Ministry was characterised by its stout opposition to imperial interference in Cape affairs, for example, quashing a bid to forcefully incorporate Griqualand West and opposing Frere's later deployment of imperial troops against the Xhosa.\n\nImportantly, the system of responsible government as instituted under Molteno retained the traditional Cape system of non-racial franchise – whereby all races could vote, quite unlike the situation in the rest of Southern Africa.\n\nA change of government in London led to a pro-imperialist lobby headed by Secretary of State, Lord Carnarvon, determined to bring all of southern Africa into the British Empire by enforcing a confederation onto the region. This \"new and impatient imperialism\" was resisted by the states of southern Africa, including the Cape colony government, and relations between the Molteno government and the British Colonial Office deteriorated.\n\nMolteno himself argued that \"the proposals for confederation should emanate from the communities to be affected, and not be pressed upon them from outside.\" – and that the whole scheme was particularly badly timed. The different states of southern Africa were still simmering after the last bout of British imperial expansion, and he stressed that the forced imposition of a lop-sided confederation would cause immense instability.\nMolteno's government also transmitted to London its concern that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would endanger the rights and franchise of the Cape's Black citizens; if there was to be any form of union, the Cape's non-racialism would need to be imposed on the Boer republics, and could not be compromised.\n\nHowever, the Colonial Office went ahead and dismissed governor Henry Barkly and appointed Henry Bartle Frere who on 3 February 1878 dissolved the Cape government. Frere was a formidable administrator of the British Empire but had scant experience of southern Africa and the confederation scheme soon fell apart, leaving a trail of wars across the region as predicted, including long-running conflicts with the Xhosa, Pedi and Basotho nations. After the disastrous British invasion of Zululand and rising discontent in the Transvaal (that later exploded as the First Boer War), Frere was recalled to London to face charges of misconduct in 1880.\n\nMolteno was repeatedly asked to form a government again, however (by now in his late sixties) he declined and chose to retire from public life to spend time with his family. He directed the appointment of Thomas Charles Scanlen instead, and his last office was a brief stint advising the Scanlen Ministry as Colonial Secretary before he retired completely.\n\nHis legacy was in the system of responsible government and parliamentary accountability that he established. Molteno did not refer to himself as a liberal, preferring to see himself simply as a pragmatist. However, as an early proponent of multi-racial democracy, he was very influential on the later Cape Liberal tradition.\n\nHe was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1882. (It was not an honour that he greatly valued however, and he had already refused three previous knighthoods earlier in his career.)\n\nIn person, Molteno was described as straight-talking and good-natured, with an easy laugh and a mischievous smile; politically outspoken and vigilant.\nHis strongest political opponents on the other hand, accused him of being fierce, stubborn, and too much influenced by Saul Solomon (a liberal MP whom Molteno held in high regard). In Lord De Villiers’s biography he is summed up as \"a fighter, who did not mind hard knocks, as long as he could return them.\"\n\nMolteno was unusually tall and powerfully built. In Southern Africa he acquired the nickname the \"Lion of Beaufort\", though his British opponents reputedly referred to him in private as the \"Beaufort Boer\". The nicknames were both reportedly due to his deep booming voice, his height, and the large beard he grew in later life. The Dictionary of National Biography adds \"Sir John Molteno was a man of commanding presence and great physical strength. In private life, he was of most simple and unostentatious habits.\"\n\nMolteno was married three times and had a total of nineteen children, founding a large and influential South African family. His immediate descendents included politicians and members of parliament, shipping magnates and exporters, military leaders, suffragists and anti-Apartheid activists.\n\nAlthough born and raised a Catholic, Molteno was tight-lipped on the subject of his religious beliefs, unusual for a man known to be frank and direct. According to his son and biographer, he disliked denominations and was a freethinker.\n\nThe \"Lion of Beaufort\" died on 1 September 1886 and was interred at St Saviour's in Claremont, Cape Town.\n\nThe town of Molteno, in the Stormberg Mountains of South Africa, is named after him.\n\n\n"}

In 2003, the Russia expropriated Yukos and began a campaign of persecution against its executives. In 2014, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of Nevzlin and other Yukos shareholders, calling the actions of the Russian state “a ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos” and expropriate its assets.\n\nFrom 1981-87, Nevzlin was a software engineer at Zarubezhgeologia, an external trade organization of the Soviet Ministry of Geology. In 1987, he met Mikhail Khodorkovsky and became a Deputy Director at the Center for Scientific and Technical Creativity for Youth (MENATEP), attached to the Komsomol committee in Moscow's Frunzensky District.\n\nMENATEP established one of the first private banks in Russia, Bank Menatep. From 1989 to 1991, Nevzlin served as president of the bank, after which he held other high-ranking positions, including Vice Chairman of the Board (1993-1996) and Head of Public Relations (1994-1996). Nevzlin also worked at Group Menatep, focusing on corporate communications, government relations, and human resources. In April 1996 he became Vice President of Yukos, in which Menatep had acquired a 78% share in December 1995.\n\nFrom September 1997 to October 1998, Nevzlin served as first deputy director general of the Russian news agency ITAR TASS, creating a plan to gradually transform it into a joint-stock company. In April 1998 Nevzlin became First Vice Chairman of Bank Menatep. In 1999 he became First Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Yukos. From November 2001 to March 2003, he represented the Republic of Mordovia as a senator in the Federation Council of Russia. From June to November 2003, he served as the Rector of the Russian State University for the Humanities. In 2003 and 2004, Nevzlin was featured on Forbes magazine's list of the world’s 100 wealthiest people. In 2010 his wealth was estimated at US$1.3 billion.\n\nNevzlin is a co-owner and board member of Haaretz, one of Israel’s liberal newspapers, having purchased a 20% stake in the company in 2011 for 140 million shekels. Members of the Schocken family, descendants of the newspaper’s founders, retain a 60 percent stake in the company. In 2014, Nevzlin founded the monthly Hebrew-language magazine “Liberal,” which publishes analyses of Israeli political life, communications and culture. The inaugural issue appeared in May 2014.\n\nIn 2003, following prolonged clashes with the Kremlin, Yukos’ controlling shareholder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and another senior executive, Platon Lebedev, were arrested on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Both were convicted in 2005 following trials that were widely condemned internationally as procedurally flawed and politically motivated. Khodorkovsky was found guilty and the sentence for tax evasion and fraud was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights for the same affair. Yukos’ assets were subsequently awarded to state-owned companies in a series of forced auctions. Yukos was declared bankrupt in August 2006.\n\nNevzlin left Russia for Israel in 2003. In 2004 the Russian Prosecutor General's Office sought Nevzlin’s extradition over hotly disputed criminal allegations against him related to his tenure at Yukos. The Israeli government rejected the extradition request due to insufficient evidence. Two members of the public who felt aggrieved by the government’s decision sued to have it reversed. They also petitioned the interior minister to revoke Nevzlin’s Israeli citizenship on the grounds that it was obtained under false pretenses. Nevzlin’s attorney, David Libai, argued that the charges against him were the result of political persecution. A spokesman for Nevzlin stated in reaction to extradition request, \"Amnesty International, the European Parliament, and the court in the UK, are only some of the bodies that have found that Russian president Vladimir Putin is persecuting Mikhail Khodorovsky, Leonid Nevzlin, and the other shareholders in Yukos, who dared to support democratic opposition parties and openly come out against him. Putin does not hesitate to make use of the Russian authorities that are subordinate to him to create false charges - in the best tradition of the KGB, in which Putin grew up.\"\n\nIn May 2008 Israel’s Supreme Court found there was no evidence directly connecting Nevzlin to the criminal allegations made against him. The court rejected extradition and denied the motion to strip Nevzlin of his citizenship. Israel's interior minister and attorney general were ordered to pay Nevzlin’s court costs for this case. Nevzlin was tried in absentia in Russia in March 2008, found guilty of several counts of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Nevzlin called the court case a show trial orchestrated by Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn 2014, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, despite the Russian Duma having never ratified the treaty under which this judgment has been made therefore making a non-legally binding judgment, ruled unanimously that the Russian authorities had conducted a “ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos, appropriate its assets and eliminate Mr. [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky as a political opponent.” According to the panel, the forced auction of core parts of the company through contested bankruptcy proceedings “was not driven by motives of tax collection but by the desire of the State to acquire Yukos’ most valuable asset and bankrupt Yukos…. In short, it was in effect a devious and calculated expropriation.” \n\nThe former Yukos shareholders were awarded damages totaling $50 billion – the largest arbitration award in history. As the biggest shareholder of GML, the former Yukos holding company that brought the legal case, with a 70 per cent stake, Nevzlin stands to be the biggest single beneficiary from The Hague’s ruling. The Russian government failed to meet the deadline of January 15, 2015, for paying that award. Earlier news reports indicated that the former Yukos investors would seek redress by asking U.S. and EU courts to seize Russian-owned assets on their territory.\n\nNevzlin was awarded the Order of Friendship, one of the Russian Federation’s highest honors, for his efforts in supporting Boris Yeltsin’s reelection campaign in 1996.\n\nFrom March to December 2001 Nevzlin served as president of the Russian Jewish Congress. He was a key player in Jewish historical and heritage research projects, including the establishment of the Moscow Jewish Cultural Center and the International Center for Russian and Eastern European Jewish Studies in Moscow. Moreover, Nevzlin contributed to numerous other Jewish educational programs developed in collaboration with World ORT, the Jewish Agency for Israel and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.\n\nSince moving to Israel, Nevzlin has established the NADAV Foundation, which supports projects in Jewish studies and education, Israel-Diaspora relations and Jewish peoplehood. Its annual “NADAV Peoplehood Prize” has been awarded to such figures as author Elie Wiesel, retired Israeli Supreme Court Chief Justice Aharon Barak, and, most recently, Rabbi David Stav, an Israeli Orthodox rabbi.\n\nNevzlin created the Leonid Nevzlin Research Center for Russian and Eastern European Jewry at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University. He has also served on the boards of both the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University.\n\nIn collaboration with the Israeli government, Nevzlin created a relief fund in 2004 to revive Beit Hatfutsot – the Museum of the Jewish People, located on the campus of Tel Aviv University, and was elected Chairman of its International Board of Governors. The NADAV Foundation launched the International School for Jewish Peoplehood Studies at Beit Hatfutsot in 2006, and the Nevzlin Center for Jewish Peoplehood at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya in 2010.\n\nNevzlin has served on the Board of Governors of the Jewish Agency for Israel and the Board of Trustees of Keren Hayesod, the United Israel Appeal, and as Associate Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute.\n\nNevzlin is also a long-term supporter of Israeli healthcare charity Ezra Lemarpeh.\n\nNevzlin was born in Moscow on 21 September 1959 into a family of Belarusian-Jewish origin. He graduated from the Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas in 1981, and earned an MA from the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, majoring in management and marketing. Nevzlin has married three times and has five children including Irina Nevzlin, chair of the board of Directors at Beit Hatfutsot. Through Irina, he is the father in law of Israeli politician Yuli-Yoel Edelstein.\n\nIn 2014, Nevzlin acquired an apartment in the new, upscale Waldorf-Astoria hotel/apartment complex in the center of Jerusalem at a cost of 40 million shekels (approximately US$11.5 million).\n\nNevzlin is the author of the two books “Человек с рублем” (“Man with a Ruble,” coauthored with Mikhail Khodorkovsky), in praise of free-market economics, and “Public Relations – кому это надо?” (“Public Relations – Who Needs Them?”).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1160722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1160722", "title": "Negotiable instrument", "text": "Negotiable instrument\n\nA negotiable instrument is a document guaranteeing the payment of a specific amount of money, either on demand, or at a set time, with the payer usually named on the document. More specifically, it is a document contemplated by or consisting of a contract, which promises the payment of money without condition, which may be paid either on demand or at a future date. The term can have different meanings, depending on what law is being applied and what country and context it is used in.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Nations almost all jurisdictions have codified the law relating to negotiable instruments in a Bills of Exchange Act, e.g. Bills of Exchange Act 1882 in the UK, Bills of Exchange Act 1908 in New Zealand, Bills of Exchange Act 1909 in Australia, the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in India and the Bills of Exchange Act 1914 in Mauritius. The Bills of Exchange Act:\n\nAdditionally most Commonwealth jurisdictions have separate Cheques Acts providing for additional protections for bankers collecting unendorsed or irregularly endorsed cheques, providing that cheques that are crossed and marked 'not negotiable' or similar are not transferable, and providing for electronic presentation of cheques in inter-bank cheque clearing systems.\n\nThe ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as \"praescriptiones\" in the 1st century BCE and 2,000-year-old Roman promissory notes have been found\n\nCommon prototypes of bills of exchanges and promissory notes originated in China, where special instruments called \"feitsyan\" were used to safely transfer money over long distances during the reign of the Tang Dynasty in the 8th century.\n\nAround 1150 the Knights Templar issued bank notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.\n\nIn the mid-13th century, the Ilkhanid rulers of Persia printed the \"cha\" or \"chap\" which was used as paper money for limited usage for transactions between the court and the merchants for about three years before it collapsed. The collapse was caused by the court accepting the \"cha\" only at progressive discount.\n\nLater, such documents were used for money transfer by Middle Eastern merchants, who had used the prototypes of bills of exchange (\"suftadja\" or \"softa\") from the 8th century to present. Such prototypes came to be used later by the Iberian and Italian merchants in the 12th century. In Italy in the 13–15th centuries, bills of exchange and promissory notes obtained their main features, while further phases of their development have been associated with France (16–18th centuries, where the endorsement had appeared) and Germany (19th century, formalization of Exchange Law). The first mention of the use of bills of exchange in English statutes dates from 1381, under Richard II; the statute mandates the use of such instruments in England, and prohibits the future export of gold and silver specie, in any form, to settle foreign commercial transactions. English exchange law was different than continental European law because of different legal systems; the English system was adopted later in the United States.\n\nThe modern emphasis on negotiability may also be traced to Lord Mansfield. Germanic Lombards documents may also have some elements of negotiability.\n\nA negotiable instrument can serve to convey value constituting at least part of the performance of a contract, albeit perhaps not obvious in contract formation, in terms inherent in and arising from the requisite offer and acceptance and conveyance of consideration. The underlying contract contemplates the right to hold the instrument as, and to negotiate the instrument to, a \"holder in due course\", the payment on which is at least part of the performance of the contract to which the negotiable instrument is linked. The instrument, memorializing: (1) the power to demand payment; and, (2) the right to be paid, can move, for example, in the instance of a \"bearer instrument\", wherein the possession of the document itself attributes and ascribes the right to payment. Certain exceptions exist, such as instances of loss or theft of the instrument, wherein the possessor of the note may be a holder, but not necessarily a holder in due course. Negotiation requires a valid \"endorsement\" of the negotiable instrument.\n\nThe consideration constituted by a negotiable instrument is cognizable as the value given up to acquire it (benefit) and the consequent loss of value (detriment) to the prior holder; thus, no separate consideration is required to support an accompanying contract assignment. The instrument itself is understood as memorializing the right for, and power to demand, payment, and an obligation for payment evidenced by the instrument itself with possession as a holder in due course being the touchstone for the right to, and power to demand, payment. In some instances, the negotiable instrument can serve as the writing memorializing a contract, thus satisfying any applicable statute of frauds as to that contract.\n\nThe rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument are qualitatively, as matters of law, superior to those provided by ordinary species of contracts:\n\nNegotiation often enables the transferee to become the party to the contract through a contract assignment (provided for explicitly or by operation of law) and to enforce the contract in the transferee-assignee’s own name. Negotiation can be effected by endorsement and delivery (order instruments), or by delivery alone (bearer instruments).\n\nPromissory notes and bills of exchange are two primary types of negotiable instruments.\n\nAlthough possibly non-negotiable, a promissory note may be a negotiable instrument if it is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand to the \"payee\", or at fixed or determinable future time, certain in money, to order or to bearer. (see Sec. 194) The law applicable to the specific instrument will determine whether it is a negotiable instrument or a non-negotiable instrument.\n\nBank notes are frequently referred to as promissory notes, a promissory note made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. According to section 4 of India's Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, \"a Promissory Note is an writing (not being a bank note or currency note), containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or the bearer of the instrument\".\n\nA bill of exchange or \"draft\" is a written order by the \"drawer\" to the \"drawee\" to pay money to the \"payee\". A common type of bill of exchange is the cheque (\"check\" in American English), defined as a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and payable on demand. Bills of exchange are used primarily in international trade, and are written orders by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. They are not used as often today.\n\nA bill of exchange is essentially an order made by one person to another to pay money to a third person. A bill of exchange requires in its inception three parties—the drawer, the drawee, and the payee. The person who draws the bill is called the drawer. He gives the order to pay money to the third party. The party upon whom the bill is drawn is called the drawee. He is the person to whom the bill is addressed and who is ordered to pay. He becomes an acceptor when he indicates his willingness to pay the bill. The party in whose favor the bill is drawn or is payable is called the payee. The parties need not all be distinct persons. Thus, the drawer may draw on himself payable to his own order.\nA bill of exchange may be endorsed by the payee in favour of a third party, who may in turn endorse it to a fourth, and so on indefinitely. The \"holder in due course\" may claim the amount of the bill against the drawee and all previous endorsers, regardless of any counterclaims that may have disabled the previous payee or endorser from doing so. This is what is meant by saying that a bill is negotiable.\nIn some cases a bill is marked \"not negotiable\"—see crossing of cheques. In that case it can still be transferred to a third party, but the third party can have no better right than the transferor.\n\nIn the United States, Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) govern the issuance and transfer of negotiable instruments, unless the instruments are governed by Article 8 of the UCC. The various state law enactments of UCC §§ 3–104(a) through (d) set forth the legal definition of what is and what is not a \"negotiable instrument\":\n\nThus, for a writing to be a negotiable instrument under Article 3, the following requirements must be met:\nThe latter requirement is referred to as the \"words of negotiability\": a writing which does not contain the words \"to the order of\" (within the four corners of the instrument or in endorsement on the note or in allonge) or indicate that it is payable to the individual holding the contract document (analogous to the holder in due course) is not a negotiable instrument and is not governed by Article 3, even if it appears to have all of the other features of negotiability. The only exception is that if an instrument meets the definition of a cheque (a bill of exchange payable on demand and drawn on a bank) and is not payable to order (i.e. if it just reads \"pay John Doe\") then it is treated as a negotiable instrument.\n\nUCC Article 3 does not apply to money, to payment orders governed by Article 4A, or to securities governed by Article 8.\n\nPersons other than the original obligor and obligee can become parties to a negotiable instrument. The most common manner in which this is done is by placing one's signature on the instrument (\"endorsement\"): if the person who signs does so with the intention of obtaining payment of the instrument or acquiring or transferring rights to the instrument, the signature is called an \"endorsement\". There are five types of endorsements contemplated by the Code, covered in UCC Article 3, Sections 204–206:\nIf a note or draft is negotiated to a person who acquires the instrument\nthe transferee is a \"holder in due course\" and can enforce the instrument \"without\" being subject to defenses which the maker of the instrument would be able to assert against the original payee, except for certain \"real defenses\". These real defenses include (1) forgery of the instrument; (2) fraud as to the nature of the instrument being signed; (3) alteration of the instrument; (4) incapacity of the signer to contract; (5) infancy of the signer; (6) duress; (7) discharge in bankruptcy; and, (8) the running of a statute of limitations as to the validity of the instrument.\nThe \"holder-in-due-course rule\" is a \"rebuttable presumption\" that makes the free transfer of negotiable instruments feasible in the modern economy. A person or entity purchasing an instrument in the ordinary course of business can reasonably expect that it will be paid when presented to, and not subject to dishonor by, the maker, without involving itself in a dispute between the maker and the person to whom the instrument was first issued (this can be contrasted to the lesser rights and obligations accruing to mere holders). Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in a particular State's law contemplate \"real defenses\" available to purported holders in due course.\nThe foregoing is the theory and application presuming compliance with the relevant law. Practically, the obligor-payor on an instrument who feels he has been defrauded or otherwise unfairly dealt with by the payee may nonetheless refuse to pay even a holder in due course, requiring the latter to resort to litigation to recover on the instrument.\n\nWhile bearer instruments are rarely created as such, a holder of commercial paper with the holder designated as payee can change the instrument to a bearer instrument by an endorsement. The proper holder simply signs the back of the instrument and the instrument becomes bearer paper, although in recent years, third party checks are not being honored by most banks unless the original payee has signed a notarized document stating such.\n\nAlternatively, an individual or company may write a check payable to \"cash\" or \"bearer\" and create a bearer instrument. Great care should be taken with the security of the instrument, as it is legally almost as good as cash.\n\nUnder the Code, the following are not negotiable instruments, although the law governing obligations with respect to such items may be similar to or derived from the law applicable to negotiable instruments:\n\nAlthough often considered foundational in business law, the modern relevance of negotiability has been questioned. Negotiability can be traced back to the 1700s and Lord Mansfield, when money and liquidity was relatively scarce. The holder in due course rule has been limited by various statutes. Concerns have also been raised that the holder in due course rule does not align the incentives of the mortgage originators and the assignees efficiently.\n\n\n"}

Marshall graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He was a national sales manager at Synergetic Micro Systems prior to their purchase by Lantronix in 2001. In 2001, he founded Perry S. Marshall & Associates, a marketing consultancy, and published his first book, \"Industrial Ethernet - A Pocket GuideT\". It was followed by a second edition, co-written with John Rinaldi. the book became an industry mainstay and textbook. Though limited on the topic of mobile networking, its coverage of the basics, and in particular power over Ethernet, became widely accepted.\n\nMarshall has been profiled in \"Click Here to Order: Stories of the World's Most Successful Internet Marketing Entrepreneurs\" by Joel Comm and \"Online Marketing Heroes: Interviews with 25 Successful Online Marketing Gurus\" by Michael Miller.\n\nMarshall started working with AdWords in 2002 soon after it was first introduced. He released \"Guerrilla Marketing for Hi-Tech Sales People\", in which he likened the use of AdWords and emerging social media to the graffiti and flash mobs of Jay Conrad Levinson's guerrilla marketing - economical attention-getting that created a grassroots customer base. He consulted and wrote on the strategy of customers finding their vendors using the newly developing search advertising; \"when the customer finds you, instead of you finding the customer, his or her perception of you is different.\" He documented the process and released the \"Definitive Guide to Google AdWords\". \"Ultimate Guide to Google AdWords\" followed in 2007;\n\nStarting with his first book on the subject, Marshall advocated AdWords split testing for market research and captured a set of guidelines for using split testing around types of ad copy and page positions that included precise wording. He coined the term \"AdWords stupidity tax\" for the premium Google charged on broad matching of search items.\n\nIn 2011, Marshall published \"Ultimate guide to Facebook advertising\", in which he focused on guerrilla marketing techniques to social media.\n\nIn 2007, he was a featured consultant on The Next Internet Millionaire, a reality show hosted by Joel Comm. Marshall spoke with the contestants on Richard Koch's 80/20 rule as it applied to internet advertising and his philosophy of investing in grassroots marketing. He expanded on this philosophy in his 2013 book, \"80/20 Sales and Marketing\", where he discussed the rule as a possible truism across several economic bands . It has been reviewed in the Huffington Post and Inc.com reviewed it as one of the \"5 Best Sales Books of 2013.\"\n\nMarshall wrote about the notion of 80/20 as a fractal phenomenon which informs pricing strategy. Leonard Kim of INC Magazine summarizes: “Within every 80/20, there is another 80/20 inside of that, then another 80/20 inside that...4% of your customers will generate 64% of your revenues; 1% of your customers will generate 50% of your revenues; 0.2% of your customers will generate 40% of your revenues.”\n\nMarshall is the author of \"Evolution 2.0: Breaking the Deadlock Between Darwin and Design\", a text in which he discusses his support for evolutionary creation. In addition he has delivered lectures on the topic, for example, at a conference of the American Scientific Affiliation. He has also supported the theological position of continuationism; and composed a list of miracles that he personally experienced.\n\n\n"}

It is a legal principle under the subject of the freedom of association. The term defines the activities workers may partake in without fear of employer retaliation. In countries where there is relatively robust employee dismissal protection, the protection of protected concerted activity is less of a distinct legal issue. In liberal market societies like the United States, where it is comparatively easy for an employer to fire an employee, the issue of protected concerted activity has become an important employment protection. \n\nThe National Labor Relations Act, the main labor policy governing labor relations in the United States, defines concerted activity in Section 7. \nSection 7 - Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection...\nGenerally speaking, there is protected concerted activity when two or more employees act together to improve their terms and conditions of employment, although it is (on rare occasions) possible for conduct to be so egregious that it becomes unprotected. Employees have a right to advocate in this manner even where there is no union involved. \n\nAt times, protected concerted activity has extended to individual employees; for example, when an employee speaks individually to his or her employer on behalf of him or herself and one or more co-workers about improving workplace conditions. An individual employee who seeks to enforce a collective bargaining agreement will generally be deemed to be engaged in concerted activity. On the other hand, an employee who acts as a \"whistleblower\" may or may not be engaging in concerted activity; if the complaint is entirely individual and the employee has not discussed it with co-workers, it is unlikely to be protected by the National Labor Relations Act (though it may well be protected under some other public policy).\n\nThe Act does not limit the manner, time, or place in which employees can engage in concerted activity. Consequently, in recent years, the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board has often taken the position that employee conversations about common workplace issues which make use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter are protected against retaliation.\n"}

His younger brother, Jaime Velayo Ongpin, was Minister of Finance of the Philippines under President Cory Aquino.\n\nIn the 2018 ranking by Forbes Magazine of the world's richest, Ongpin was named as the Philippines' twelfth wealthiest Filipino (up from sixteenth in 2017), with a net worth US$ 1.22 billion. In response to the article, Ongpin wrote the magazine to correct inaccurate information published in their online version. In particular Ongpin referred to charges of alleged insider trading in a 2009 sale of Philex Mining shares, which Ongpin says he \"not only denies,\" but the charges have also been dismissed by the courts in 2015. Ongpin also questioned Forbes' inclusion of a $3.4 million fine levied by the Philippines's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and prohibition from holding office in public companies. Ongpin explained that in 2017 he had \"appealed this to the Court of Appeals,\" which then sustained the appeal and \"permanently enjoined the SEC from enforcing these penalties\". Ongpin also clarified that, contrary to what was also published in the magazine, Alphaland is not a \"$45.7 million property developer, but is \"actually a $1.2 billion property developer.\" Ongpin's business interests lie in real estate development, resort development, mining, energy, and transportation.\n\nRoberto Velayo Ongpin was born on January 6, 1937. He is the second of seven children by Luis Roa Ongpin and Lourdes Morales Velayo. He grew up in the neighborhood of Pinaglabanan in San Juan, which was then a suburb of the City of Manila. Roberto Ongpin is the great grandson of Román T. Ongpin, a Filipino-Chinese businessman and philanthropist who aided Filipino revolutionaries against the Spanish and American colonial administration in the Philippine islands. The Ongpins have been named as among the \"most influential and enduring families of the Philippines\" for their contributions to the nation's growth.\n\nOngpin was able to attend school through a scholarship. After graduating from Ateneo High School, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (cum laude) from the Ateneo de Manila University in 1957. He became a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in 1958, after which he briefly joined Procter & Gamble in Manila.\n\nIn 1961, Ongpin earned his Masters of Business Administration from Harvard University. It was during his time in Harvard that he met and married his wife of 55 years, Monica Arellano of Valparaiso, Chile. They have two children together, Stephen Arellano Ongpin and Anna Arellano Ongpin. He also has two other children from different mothers, Michelle Schroer Ongpin and Julian Stone Ongpin.\n\nIn the early hours of February 22, 1986, as Roberto V. Ongpin was preparing to go to Malacañan Palace for a meeting with President Marcos, US Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, and Special Envoy Philip Habib, he noticed that his military escorts had been pulled out. Ongpin's subsequent calls to then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile inquiring about the whereabouts of his security detail inadvertently alerted Enrile that Marcos may have already been aware of his plans to stage a coup de'tat. This triggered Enrile's hasty break from the government, eventually leading to the People Power Revolution that installed Corazon C. Aquino as the new Philippine President.\n\nAfter moving back to the Philippines in 1963, Roberto V. Ongpin was recruited by his maternal uncle, Fred Velayo to work for \"the Philippines' largest multidisciplinary professional services firm,\" Sycip Gorres Velayo & Company (SGV). According to SGV Chairman Emeritus Washington Sycip, Ongpin is \"one of the most aggressive and effective managers\" he has ever known. In 1966, two years after joining the firm, Ongpin - who was barely 30 years old at that time - was named a managing partner of SGV. He served the company from 1964 to 1979.\n\nIn 1979, Roberto V. Ongpin became the Philippines' youngest Trade and Industry Minister at age 42 when he accepted the invitation of former Philippine President, Ferdinand E. Marcos, Sr., to join his cabinet.\n\nDuring his six-years as Minister, Ongpin grappled with the deteriorating economy as political instability made funding from international agencies and banks difficult for the government. On occasion, he personally had to negotiate financing for the Philippines with other world leaders, including Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.\n\nIn 1984, with \"the Philippines facing a debt and foreign exchange crisis, the black market exchange rate soared to Php 30 per Dollar (versus the official rate of Php 14 per Dollar).\" Ongpin is credited with stabilizing the Philippine Peso by establishing the \"Binondo Central Bank,\" a dual exchange rate system that allowed the government to narrow the rate gap by directly intervening in black market currency prices.\n\nAfter the fall of Marcos, Roberto V. Ongpin concentrated on growing his businesses. Among his first ventures Belle Corp. with former fellow Binondo Central Bank veteran, Benito Tan Guat. As chief executive officer, Ongpin was \"undoubtedly recognized as the creator\" of the Belle's flagship development, Tagaytay Highlands. He was also \"instrumental in transforming the property into what it is today, one of the premier developments outside Metro Manila,\" and \"the single largest - and most successful - upscale resort community in the Philippines to date.\"\n\nRoberto V. Ongpin is the chairman of investment holding company Atok-Big Wedge, Inc. The company's primary purpose is general investment. The company's second purposes include mining, real estate, manufacturing, processing, lending and borrowing money.\n\nOngpin owns 92% of the shares of Alphaland, and is chairman of Alphaland Balesin Island Club, Inc., and the City Club at Alphaland Makati Place, Inc.; the developers of the Balesin Island Club, a \"world-class, members-only resort that has been described as a 500-hectare paradise with 7.3 kilometers of pristine white sand beaches, located 21 kilometers southwest of Polillo, Quezon Province,\" and the City Club, an Php 8 billion multi-use commercial residential complex that has three high-rise buildings, a shopping mall, and a \"3-hectare leisure, entertainment and business club.\" In 2015, Alphaland’s comprehensive net income rose 31% to P7.2 billion, from P5.5 billion in the previous year. In 2016 company profits rose 7.5% to Php 7.7 billion (from Php 7.2B in 2015).\n\nThe company also owns and operates Alphaland Aviation, Inc.. It has a pending petition before the Philippines Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to be allowed \"to be granted the authority to operate domestic air transportation services.\" Alphaland Aviation currently provides exclusive charter services to Balesin Island Club located in Lamon Bay, Quezon province.\n\nIn September 2017 Ongpin launched Alphaland Baguio Mountain Lodges, \" a 78-hectare master-planned development of 300 lodge-style log homes\" in Baguio City, Philippines.The project is being developed at a cost of P5 billion. The first 50 homes is expected to be finished by April 2018; the next 100 homes by April 2019 and the final 150 homes by April 2020.\n\nIn 1969, Ongpin established South Seas Oil and Mineral Exploration Co. Inc. a mining and exploration company incorporated on August 20 of that year. On March 29, 1984, the stockholders authorized the change in the Company’s name to South Seas Natural Resources, Inc., which was approved by the SEC.\n\nOn January 18, 2000, South Seas Natural Resources, Inc. became PhilWeb.Com, Inc., an internet company, upon the stockholders’ approval of a restructuring plan which involved changes in the Company’s name, and primary purpose, among others.\n\nAt the annual stockholders’ meeting on May 31, 2002, the stockholders approved the change in corporate name from PhilWeb.com, Inc. to PhilWeb Corporation. The stockholders also approved the inclusion of the gaming business as an additional secondary purpose of the Company. The SEC approved these changes on November 5, 2002.\n\nIn August 2016, Ongpin resigned his post as chairman of PhilWeb Corporation, after being tagged by President Rodrigo Duterte as being part of the oligarchy, which was followed by a subsequent order to halt the online gambling industry, which was the core business of Philweb. Ongpin later clarified that Philweb is \"not an online gaming company,\" but is merely the \"software providers of e-Games, which is actually owned by (the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation).\"\n\nThe unexpected singling out of Ongpin by the President has puzzled many observers, with some speculating that he may have just been a victim of the Philippines' \"murky\" politics. Ongpin however stresses that he 'bears no rancor' towards Duterte. \"He is my President, and I will do all I can to support him and his policies.\" Ongpin's decision to sell his shares in PhilWeb to former president Marcos' son-in-law, Gregorio Araneta III, has led to a lessening of the political pressure on himself and the company, allowing him to focus on his other business interests.\n\nMr. Roberto V. Ongpin was also previously the Chairman by Philippine Bank of Communications, Inc., Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc., (2006-2011), Belle Corporation, La Flor dela Isabela (1996), Sinophil Corporation, RVO Capital Ventures Corporation, Tabacalera Incorporada, Connectivity Unlimited Resource Enterprise, Inc. (2006), and Philippine Global Communications, Inc. (PHILCOM). He was vice chairman of Philex Mining Corporation (2007-2009).\n\nHe was Director for the following corporations Araneta Properties, Inc., (until 2009), Ginebra San Miguel Corporation (2010-2013), Petron Corporation (2008-2014), San Miguel Corporation (2009-2014), PAL Holdings, Inc. and Philippine Airlines, Inc. (2012-2014), and Makati Shangri-La Hotel & Resort, Inc. (2003-2014).\n\nOngpin has also beem affiliated with various foreign companies, including as Chairman of the Acentic GmbH (2010-2013), Developing Countries Investment Corp.

He is likely an ancestor of Haim Palachi of 19th-Century Izmir.\n\nPallache was born in Fez, Morocco. His father, Isaac Pallache, was a rabbi there, first mentioned in \"takkanot\" (Jewish community statutes) in 1588. His brother was Joseph Pallache. His uncle was Fez's grand rabbi, Judah Uziel; his son Isaac Uziel was a rabbi of the Neve Shalom community in Amsterdam.\n\nHis family originated from Islamic Spain, where his father had served as rabbi in Córdoba. According to Professor Mercedes García-Arenal, \"The Pallaches were a Sephardi family perhaps descended from the \"Bene Palyāj\" mentioned by the twelfth-century chronicler Abraham Ibn Da’ud as 'the greatest of the families of Cordoba'.\"\n\nSometime in the first half of the 16th Century, following the Christian conquest of Islamic Spain (the \"Reconquista\"), the family fled to Morocco, where Jews, like Christians, were tolerated as long as they accepted Islam as the official religion. How they arrived is unclear. One Italian historian states, \"Verso i Paesi Bassi emigra anche la famiglia Pallache, forse dal Portogallo o dalla Spagna, oppure, secundo un'altra ipotesti, dalla nativa Spagna emigra a Fez, dove un Isaac Pallache è rabbino nel 1588\" (translation: \"The Pallache family also emigrated to the Netherlands, perhaps from Portugal or Spain, or, according to another hypothesis, they emigrated [directly] from their native Spain to Fez, where one Isaac Pallache was rabbi in 1588.\")\n\n Pallache arrived in the Netherlands between 1590 and 1597. In 1591, Middelburg offered him residential permit, but Protestant pastors protested.\n\nAfter a delegation from the Dutch Republic visited Morocco to discuss a common alliance against Spain and the Barbary pirates, sultan Zidan Abu Maali in 1608 appointed the merchant Samuel Pallache to be his envoy to the Dutch government in The Hague. Officially, Pallache served as his \"agent\", not ambassador.\n\nOn June 23, 1608, Pallache met stadholder Maurice of Nassau and the States-General in The Hague to negotiate an alliance of mutual assistance against Spain. On December 24, 1610, the two nations signed the Treaty of Friendship and Free Commerce, an agreement recognising free commerce between the Netherlands and Morocco, and allowing the sultan to purchase ships, arms and munitions from the Dutch. This was one of the first official treaties between a European country and a non-Christian nation, after the 16th-Century treaties of the Franco-Ottoman alliance.\n\nThe story goes that, one day, Pallache's horse-drawn carriage met the carriage of the Spanish ambassador in The Hague. The two carriages were unable to pass one another and, to cheers from onlookers, the Spanish ambassador's carriage had to make way for Pallache's carriage.\n\nResearch has shown that Pallache secretly acted as a double agent. He maintained close ties with the Spanish court and passed classified information about Dutch-Moroccan relations on to the Spanish. At the same time, he was passing information about Spain back to the Dutch and Moroccans. When this eventually came to light, he fell out of favor with the sultan.\n\nIn addition to his diplomatic affairs, Pallache also continued his activities as a merchant, actively trading between the Netherlands and Morocco. He also got permission from Prince Maurice for privateering activities. The goods obtained through these pirating activities were sold along the Moroccan coast.\n\n In 1614, Pallache, having captured a Portuguese ship, was unable to bring its cargo ashore in Morocco and so sailed for the Netherlands. A heavy storm forced him to seek refuge in an English port where, by request of the Spanish ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned. Eventually, Prince Maurice came to his aid and helped bring him back to the Netherlands. However, he had lost all his money by then and fell ill shortly thereafter.\n\nIn the first pages of his 1769 \"Memorias do Estabelecimento e Progresso dos Judeos Portuguezes e Espanhoes nesta Famosa Cidade de Amsterdam\", David Franco Mendes records the first minyan in Amsterdam with its sixteen worshippers: Jacob Israel Belmonte (father of Moses Belmonte), David Querido, Jacob Tirado, Samuel Pallache, Ury a Levy, Joseph Pallache, Jacob Uriel Cardoso, Isaac Gaon, Samuel Abrabanel Souza, Jeosuah Sarfati, Joseph Habilho, David Abendana Pereyra, Baruch Osorio, Abraham Gabay, Isaac Franco Medeyro, Moseh de Casserez. Several sources claim this first \"minyan\" occurred in Palache's home, as he was the most prominent among them, being envoy from Morocco and occurred around 1590 or Yom Kippur 1596.\n\n Both \"Les noms des juifs du Maroc\" and \"A Man of Three Worlds\" describe several generations of Pallache family members, which forms the basis of the family descent shown below.\n\nSamuel's wife was Reina (Hebrew \"Malca\") (English \"Queen\"). \"Les noms\" cites two sons, Isaac and Jacob, \"One Man\" cites only Isaac. Samuel's brother Joseph had five sons: Isaac, Joshua, David, Moses, and Abraham. \"One Man\" cites Moses (and David) as most influential person after Samuel's death and de facto leader of the family, even before his own (elderly) father Joseph.\n\n19th Century descendants included four grand rabbis, three in Izmir, Turkey (Haim Palachi, Abraham Palacci, and Rahamim Nissim Palacci) and one in the Netherlands (Isaac Juda Palache)–spellings of the surname varied considerably over the centuries).\n\nPublication of \"A Man of Three Worlds: Samuel Pallache, a Moroccan Jew in Catholic and Protestant Europe\" in English (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press: 2003) and originally in Spanish as \"Entre el Islam y Occident: La vida de Samuel Pallache, judío de Fez\" (Madrid: Siglo XXI 1999) has led to some popular emphasis on Pallache as pirate. A main source of this reputation is Edward Kritzler's book \"Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean\" (2008), which calls Samuel Palache the \"Pirate Rabbi\" who \"was still capturing Spanish ships in his late sixties.\". The book led to reviews with titles like \"Sephardi Sea Hawks\" and \"Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Schnapps\" among other reviews. It has led to continued mentions of Pallache in current-day print, such as \"Merchant, Diplomat, Pirate, Spy Dies in Amsterdam\" and \"The Pirate Rabbi.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11182562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11182562", "title": "Sustainable Forestry Initiative", "text": "Sustainable Forestry Initiative\n\nThe Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) is a North American 'forest certification standard' and program of SFI Inc., a non-profit organization. The Sustainable Forestry Initiative is the world’s largest single forest certification standard by area.The SFI is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario Canada and Washington D.C. USA.\n\nIn 2005, the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), which itself is the world's largest forest certifications system, recognized the SFI standard.\n\nThe SFI Forest Management Standard covers key values such as protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration. A new set of SFI 2015-2019 Standards and Rules, developed through an open review process, took effect on Jan. 1, 2015. All SFI certifications require independent, third-party audits and are performed by internationally accredited certification bodies.\n\nThe SFI Standards are revised and updated every five years to incorporate the latest scientific information and to respond to emerging issues. As part of this process, comments were received during two 60-day public comment periods in 2013 and 2014, and input was received from 12 public workshops across the United States and Canada. About 10,000 stakeholders were invited to submit comments. Participants included public and private landowners, forest sector representatives, Indigenous communities, conservation groups, industry, academia and government officials. \n\nIndependent oversight was provided at each stage of the revision process by the SFI External Review Panel, a group of independent experts representing conservation, professional, academic and public organizations, operating at arm’s length from SFI. The SFI External Review Panel reviewed every public comment submitted to ensure that all comments were considered, and to guarantee the Standard revision process was transparent, objective and credible. The responses to comments are posted on the SFI website.\n\nThe SFI Program only certifies lands in the United States and Canada, and program participants must comply with all applicable laws. For sources outside of North America without effective laws, participants must avoid illegal or other controversial sources. The SFI Program supports activities by international experts to find ways to address the problem of illegal logging and is a member of the international, multi-stakeholder Forest Legality Alliance.\n\nThe SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard promotes responsible forestry practices based on 14 Principles, 13 Objectives, 21 Performance Measures and 55 Indicators that address the 90 percent of the world’s forests that are not certified. The SFI 2015-2019 Fiber Sourcing Standard distinguishes SFI from all other forest certification programs in that it sets mandatory practice requirements for the responsible procurement of all fiber, even if it is sourced from non-certified land. These fiber sourcing requirements include measures to broaden the practice of biodiversity, use best management practices to protect water quality, and utilize the services of forest management and harvesting professionals. Because it governs how SFI Program Participants procure fiber from non-certified land, supporters argue that the Standard encourages the spread of responsible forestry practices.\n\nSFI has certified more than 285 million acres (115 million hectares) to its standard in the United States and Canada. At the end of October 2010, SFI had 959 chain of custody certifications at 2,339 locations. According to the United Nations, SFI was the fastest growing organization for chain of custody certifications in 2008.\n\nThe Board of Directors that governs the SFI program has three chambers that recognize economic, environmental and social sectors equally. Directors include representatives of environmental, conservation, professional and academic groups, independent professional loggers, family forest owners, public officials, labor and the forest products industry.\n\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization, in its \"2009-2010 Forest products Annual Review\", says: \"Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements.\"\n\nDovetail Partners Inc., in its \"2010 Forest Certification: A Status Report\", states: \"the previous differences between forest certification programs are much less distinct ... each program generally has the same structural programmatic requirements, although the required content and level of detail provided by each may vary considerably.\"\n\nSFI is generally considered less stringent than that of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). For example, SFI allows more tree farming and does not require conservation plans or consultation with local and indigenous stakeholders (except for public lands).\n\nSFI is less highly rated than FSC for example by Consumer Reports “Greener Choices”, and Green America. Others rate SFI/PEFC and FSC equally: TerraChoice (part of Underwriters Laboratories Global Network) in its 2010 Sins of Greenwashing report, like its 2009 one, counts the SFI/PEFC and FSC in its second-tier list of \"legitimate\" environmental standards and certifications.; as does Environment Canada's EcoLogo.\n\nA National Association of State Foresters forest certification policy statement passed by resolution in 2008 states: \"While in different manners, the ATFS (American Tree Farm System), FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability. . . . No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility.\"\n\nOn April 5, 2016, the U.S. Green Building Council issued a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) pilot alternative compliance path (ACP) designed to screen out illegal forest products from LEED buildings. While the ACP is being tested as a credit, it will ultimately become a prerequisite that applies to all LEED projects. As a pilot, the ACP does not become a permanent part of the LEED standard without an affirmative vote of the USGBC membership. The ACP pilot recognizes all certified sources - FSC, PEFC, SFI and ATFS and programs. The ACP will apply to all LEED v4 rating systems including Homes v4 and to all LEED 2009 rating systems. \n\nThe ACP categorizes the various forest certification standards based on the ASTM D7612-10 (2015) standard, which is titled “Categorizing Wood and Wood-Based Products According to Their Fiber Sources.” ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) International is a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of voluntary consensus standards.\n\nOther green building tools, including two American National Standards Institute (ANSI)-approved rating systems in the United States – ANSI-ICC 700-2008: National Green Building Standard and ANSI/GBI 01-2010: Green Building Assessment Protocol for Commercial Buildings (formerly Green Globes U.S.) – Green Globes and Built Green Canada recognize wood products certified by credible third-party certification programs like SFI.\n\nThe SFI Program is supported by conservation groups such as Conservation International, American Bird Conservancy, Ducks Unlimited, and the Conservation Fund (which serves on its Board). \n\nUnlike SFI, the FSC included environmental groups such as Greenpeace among its founders. The National Wildlife Federation and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) currently serve on the FSC Board. The Sierra Club endorses only FSC.\n\nOn September 9, 2009 the Washington State Forest Law Center, on behalf of the environmental protection group ForestEthics, filed complaints against SFI Inc. with the Federal Trade Commission and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe FTC complaint accuses SFI Inc. of misleading consumers with deceptive marketing practices. The complaint cites various aspects of SFI’s marketing, including its claim that it is an “independent” not-for-profit organization, its dependence on the timber industry for funding, and the vagueness of SFI’s environmental standards, which allow SFI-certified landowners to be certified merely because the landowner is complying with state environmental regulations. The complaint cites SFI’s certification as an example of greenwash.\n\nBoth the FTC and IRS investigated the complaints made against SFI and found them without merit. No action was taken by either investigative body.\nThe complaint filed with the IRS requests an examination of SFI Inc.’s non-profit status, based on the fact that SFI benefits the private interests of its corporate landowners and not the public interest, as well as the fact that SFI draws more than 80% of its funding from the wood and paper industry. The complaint asserts that in serving the private interests of wood and paper companies that want a ‘green’ image, SFI is inappropriately granted a nonprofit status reserved for public charities.\n\nThe IRS investigated the complaint as well as conducted a thorough examination of SFI’s non-profit status and concluded that it was appropriate and that no further action was required.\n\nThe Sierra Club has lodged a formal complaint with the SFI, alleging that Weyerhaeuser engaged in risky and irresponsible logging on steep slopes that led to 1,259 landslides in 2007 on SFI-certified Weyerhaeuser lands in Washington state. Challenging SFI to back up its claims of 'independence' and 'rigorous audits,' the Sierra Club requested that Weyerhaeuser's SFI certification be revoked.\n\nA peer reviewed landslide study concluded that the Washington State landslides that the Sierra Club attributed to Weyerhaeuser’s logging practices were the result of extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall and not the result of steep slope logging by the company. Landslides occur on both logged and unlogged sites, but science shows that logging (and logging roads) dramatically increase the risk of landslides.\n\n\n"}

The Act established the lowest rates since the Walker Tariff of 1857. Most schedules were \"ad valorem\" basis, a percentage of the value of the item. This had a profound impact for the Cuban Tobacco Industry concerning their import to the States. As President of the Union of Manufacturers of Cigars of Cuba Garbade, aided by an appointed committee, laid this out to Cuban ´s President Mario García Menocal in January 1914, insisting upon an allowance of 50 per cent on their exports of cigars as an equivalent in Cuba’s next reciprocity treaty and urging a prompt solution of this matter so vital to the Cuban cigar industry.\n\nA German Citizen in the United States in 1916, he was considered prisoner of war, and put under house arrest in his mansion in Mount Kisko, New York.

It was particularly difficult for decision makers to work through the trade-offs between costs and intangible benefits, especially for long-term investments by commercial organizations, and for governments and non-profit organizations who are primarily concerned with intangible values without wasting limited funds. Even within commercial organizations, units traditionally viewed as \"cost centres\" found it difficult to get acceptance of proposals for projects that would lead to general and long-term efficiency or capability gains, as the benefits were difficult to assign to \"profit centres\".\n\nThe approach of the VMM is to start by developing a framework of values, including costs, risks, tangible returns and intangible returns, then assign scores to each element in the framework. Once the relative scores of the different types of values are assigned and agreed, it becomes possible to examine alternatives and give yes/no decisions in a fairly objective and repeatable manner, and review progress using a range of traditional quantitative program management techniques. As well as allowing comparison of different values within a project, the quantitative approach of the VMM permits review of the total contribution to a particular value across a range of projects.\n\nVMM was developed by the General Services Administration's (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) in collaboration with Harvard University. The VMM was first articulated in a report by Booz Allen Hamilton in 2002 for the US Social Security Administration, as part of an electronic services project.\n\nIt was popularized by a suite of documents released by the US Federal Chief Information Officers Council in 2003, which give detailed guidance to agencies helping them to seek funding and plan budgets for their proposals, analyze their investments for values across their portfolio of initiatives, and track both tangible and intangible returns over time, with a particular emphasis on information technology investments and the production of \"OMB-300\" exhibits for the US Office of Management and Budget. The introductory document was given the significant title \"It's Not Just Return on Investment Anymore\".\n\nThe suite of documents from the US CIO Council include the following, which are readily adapted for other countries and non-government organizations:\nEach of the four major steps of the VMM process has tasks and outputs. The breakdown below, and the description of major value factors, is based primarily on the suite of VMM documents from the US Federal Chief Information Officers Council in 2003.\n\n\nForcing the development of the decision framework, with the assignment of scores to intangibles allowing comparison to other intangibles as well as tangibles, eases the resolution of differences of perspectives between senior managers (e.g. Chief Financial Officer, Risk Manager, and the proposer of the initiative), allows changes to the scores to flow through to the rest of the process (especially the analysis of alternatives), and provides clarity of benefits to a board (before, during, and after the initiative), and clarity of priorities to people looking after more detailed aspects of the initiative. The same transparency of values apply if the proposal is developed at an enterprise level, or within a lesser organizational unit.\n\nMajor value factors (from which the value hierarchy is developed) include the following\n\n\n\n\nA holistic approach to Capital Investment Planning (CIP), using the portfolio approach, requires a significant amount of supporting documentation. The VMM approach can provide planning data and performance assessment criteria for the following:\n\n\nIn particular, VMM allows quantitative reporting of commitments to particular intangibles across a number of initiatives, even when they differ by their stage in their lifecycles.\n\n\n\n\n"}
