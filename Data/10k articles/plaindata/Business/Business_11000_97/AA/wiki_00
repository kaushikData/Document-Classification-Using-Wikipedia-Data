{"id": "1808875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1808875", "title": "14 Wall Street", "text": "14 Wall Street\n\n14 Wall Street, originally the Bankers Trust Company Building, is a skyscraper at 14 Wall Street at the corner of Nassau Street and running through to Pine Street in the Financial District of Manhattan in New York City. It sits across Nassau Street from Federal Hall National Memorial, across Wall Street from the New York Stock Exchange and diagonally across from the original headquarters of J. P. Morgan & Company. It was built in 1910-12 and was designed by Trowbridge & Livingston in the neoclassical style as the headquarters for Bankers Trust. An addition with Art Deco detailing, designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, was constructed in 1931-33. The stepped pyramid at the building's top is a noted part of the downtown skyline, and became the logo for Bankers Trust, which sold the building in 1937.\n\nThe building was designated a New York City landmark on January 14, 1997.\n\nThe concept behind the building's design was to place the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus on top of St Mark's Campanile in Venice. Many early skyscrapers took the Venetian bell-tower as a logical model for a modern office tower, but 14 Wall Street was the first to top it off with a temple in the sky, a seven-story stepped pyramid modeled on one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Bankers Trust, for whom the building was constructed, then adopted the pyramid as its trademark, and took as its slogan \"A Tower of Strength\".\n\nThe first stage of construction, 1910–1912, was marked by the demolition of a 20-story Gillender Building, claimed to be the first skyscraper demolished to make way for a taller skyscraper. It was completed in 1912 and is tall with 37 floors. In its day the world's tallest bank building, the skyscraper originally housed the headquarters of Bankers Trust, which was founded in 1903 when a number of commercial banks needed a vehicle to enter the trusts and estates market; fourteen years later it became a full-service bank, and one of the country's wealthiest financial institutions. The bank occupied only the three lower floors; its main operations were housed elsewhere in less expensive offices. Most of the remainder of the building was rental property.\n\nThe 31st floor was once an apartment belonging to J. P. Morgan. The space was converted into an upscale French restaurant called \"The 14 Wall Street.\" However, the restaurant closed in April 2006, following plans in 2004 to convert the entire building from offices into luxury condos. On January 21, 2007, the building's owners, having stalled in their residential conversion plan, agreed to sell the property to Cushman & Wakefield. \n\nIn April 2012, majority control of the building was sold for $303 million in cash to Alexander Rovt, a fertilizer tycoon from Ukraine, who paid off the building's outstanding debt as part of the deal. Rovt, who is listed as #372 on the \"Forbes\" list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, paid less than the $325 million building had sold for in 2007, at the peak of the real estate boom. At the time of the purchase, it had 300,000 square feet of vacant space, and three potential tenants were in discussion to lease about two-thirds of that amount.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5781763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5781763", "title": "Anson Green Phelps", "text": "Anson Green Phelps\n\nAnson Green Phelps (March 24, 1781 – November 30, 1853) was an American entrepreneur and business man from Connecticut. Beginning with a saddlery business, he founded Phelps, Dodge & Co. in 1833 as an export-import business with his sons-in-law William E. Dodge and Daniel James based as partners in Liverpool, England. His third son-in-law, James Boulter Stokes, became a partner some years later.\n\nLater in the 19th century after the senior Phelps' death, Phelps Dodge acquired mining interests and companies in the American West, and became known primarily as a mining company.\n\nAnson Green Phelps was born in Simsbury, Connecticut, in 1781; his mother died when he was 12 years old. Afterward, he was raised in the house of the Congregational minister of Simsbury. Phelps was descended from the early American colonial governors Thomas Dudley, John Haynes and George Wyllys. On October 13, 1799, he chose a relative, Thomas Woodbridge Phelps, as his guardian.\n\nOn May 5, 1799, Thomas Woodbridge Phelps and Anson Green Phelps were admitted to the Congregational Church in South Canton, Connecticut, which was led by Reverend Jeremiah Hallock. In his early adulthood, Anson Phelps left Simsbury and settled in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nAfter moving to Hartford, Phelps began manufacturing saddles and shipping them to the South. His business grew rapidly. He had a large brick building constructed on North Main street, which became known as the \"Phelps Block.\" In 1812 he moved to New York City and began doing business with Elisha Peck under the firm name of Phelps, Peck & Co. in the United States. In Liverpool, England, where Peck managed it, the firm was known as Peck, Phelps & Co. They dealt in metal imports from England including tin, tin plate, iron, and brass; and exported cotton from the South to the textile mills in England. Such cotton trade was highly important to England and contributed to its considering support for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.\n\nFellow businessman Sheldon Smith persuaded Phelps to invest in the growing town of Derby, Connecticut, in an area that came to be known as Birmingham. Unable to grow his business farther north, Phelps selected a location on the east bank of the Naugatuck River in what is now downtown Ansonia. Ansonia was first settled in 1652 and named in honor of Anson Phelps. The state chartered Ansonia as a borough of Derby in 1864, and later as a separate town in 1889. In 1893, Ansonia incorporated as a city, consolidating with the boundaries of the town.\n\nPhelps' business continued to prosper and he accumulated a large fortune. His original partnership with Peck was dissolved in 1832 following the destruction of their New York warehouse (4 May 1832) due to structural failure. Phelps and his son narrowly escaped, but among the dead was Josiah Stokes, a senior clerk who was betrothed to Phelps daughter, Caroline.\n\nThis was a terrible blow to Phelps and his family. He reorganized the business, forming the Phelps Dodge Company in 1833 with his sons-in-law William Earl Dodge and Daniel James as partners. The two of them operated the firm's functions in Liverpool, England. In 1839 Phelps made his son Anson G. Phelps, Jr. a partner, with a one-eighth share of the business.\n\nCaroline Phelps eventually married James Boulter Stokes, brother of the dead Josiah. He became the third son-in-law of Phelps to join Phelps, Dodge & Co. as a partner. Stokes was wealthy in his own right. During the 1837 financial crisis, he helped the Phelps, Dodge partnership through a difficult time with a loan.\n\nPhelps' business interests included banking, property, mining, ironworks, shipping, railroads and timber. After the split with Peck, some of these interests were divided between the two men. Others remained in joint partnership, including the New York property portfolio and shipping. Peck, who took over the rolling mill at Haverstraw, would continue to purchase raw materials from Phelps.\n\nPhelps continued to be an active member of the Congregational Church, and he took an interest in a number of philanthropic causes. He contributed generously to the American Bible Society, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the American Home Missionary Society, the Colonization Society, the Blind Asylum of New York City, and served as the president of each at some point during his life.\n\nHe also contributed to many other societies and charitable institutions both while he lived and through his estate. He gave his native town of Simsbury, Connecticut US$1000 to aid the poor. Among his other philanthropic activities was the creation of the Anson G. Phelps lecture series on early American history at New York University.\n\nIn the 1830s, Phelps supported Presbyterian preacher Charles Grandison Finney during his ministry in New York. Phelps first hired a church for him in Vanderwater Street, and later purchased a church in Princes Street, near Broadway. Finney was \"much struck with the piety of Mr Phelps\", and said that Phelps would rise at night so that he could commune with God, having little time for secret devotion during the day, when business pressed him.\n\nPhelps married Olivia Egleston, daughter of Elihu and Elizabeth Egleston, on 26 October 1806 at the age of 25. He and Olivia had nine children: Elizabeth, Melissa, Caroline Olivia (died in infancy), and Caroline, all born in Hartford; and Harriett, Anson Green Jr., Olivia Egleston, and Lydia Ann, all born in New York City. His grandsons included Anson Phelps Stokes and William Earl Dodge Stokes. His great-grandson, Anson Phelps Stokes, became a well-known philanthropist. In 1835 Phelps purchased the house of Henry A. Coster and added land to extend the property from Third Avenue to the East River, and from Twenty-ninth to half-way between Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth streets.\n\nPhelps died at his New York residence, formerly the Coster place, on 30 November 1853 at age 73. He left about two million dollar, of which almost seven hundred thousand was his shares in Phelps Dodge & Co. These were purchased by the other partners. Just over one million dollars was property in New York, Indiana, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Missouri. His will was contested and there were so many anomalies that his widow, who was the executrix, put it before the courts to sort out. It was after her death that the final verdict was given by the court of appeal in 1861. Due to a technical issue with the wording of the will, one large bequest of $50,000 to the Liberia College was declared void by the courts. However, the family held this bequest to be sacred and the donation stood despite the ruling.\n\nHe was eulogized by a Mrs. Sigourney in writing:\nIn his will, Phelps left instructions to his heirs in terms that characterized his life:\nHis funeral was at the Presbyterian Church, Mercer Street, New York, where he had been a ruling elder. He was buried in his family vault in the New York Marble Cemetery. He was later re-interred in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.\n\n\n"}

It has recently been moved from its long-time location in Campus Martius Park to a new location in just down the street in Cadillac Square Park. The fountain was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1971. The John N. Bagley House (1889) at 2921 East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit was constructed for Governor Bagley's son, and is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nJohn J. Bagley was the 16th governor of Michigan, serving from 1873 to 1877. Bagley also served as a Detroit Alderman from 1860–61 and as Police Commissioner from 1865-72. He was instrumental in the creation of the Detroit Metropolitan Police Commission and the construction of the first Detroit House of Corrections. When Bagley died in 1881, his will contained $5,000 for the construction of a drinking fountain for the people of Detroit, having \"water cold and pure as the coldest mountain stream.\"\n\nIn 1885, the Bagley family chose Henry Hobson Richardson to design the fountain. In 1887, the Bagley Memorial Fountain was dedicated at the corner of Woodward Avenue and Fort Street. Richardson constructed the fountain entirely out of pink Bragville granite, modeled after a ciborium located in St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. The Bagley Memorial Fountain stands 21 feet high with a basin 7 feet across. At the center of the fountain, four lion heads distribute water. In the original design, two of the heads produced \"normal\" temperature water and the other two produced cold water, chilled by ice packed around the fountain pipes. The inscription on the four sides of the cornice reads: TESTAMENTARY GIFT | FOR THE PEOPLE FROM | JOHN JVDSON BAGLEY | A.D. MDCCCLXXXVII.\n\nIn 1926 the fountain was moved from its original home at Woodward and Fort to Campus Martius, because of the increase of automobile traffic. In 2000, the fountain was removed from it site, disassembled, and put into storage. In 2007, the fountain was installed in its current location in Cadillac Square; a new lion fountainhead replaced the original, which was stolen. It is the only remaining work by Richardson in the Detroit area.\n\n"}

He receives academic credit for studying organizations as a separate field, rather than a \"smaller sister of sociology.\". \n\nBorn in Vienna, Virginia to former Union veteran Capt. Orrin E. Hine and his wife Alma, Hine graduated from United States Military Academy, West Point in 1891, and served as a lieutenant in the 6th United States Infantry. He later graduated from Cincinnati Law School. He married Helen Underwood on March 27, 1915.\n\nLeaving the Army to enter railway service, Hine worked as freight brakeman, switchman, yardmaster, emergency conductor, chief clerk to superintendent, and trainmaster. When the Spanish–American War began in 1898 he quit railway service and participated in the Santiago campaign as a major of volunteers. After the war he re-entered railway work, rising to trainmaster and later general superintendent. Subsequently, he did special railway work in various staff positions for both large and small railways in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nHine inspected safety appliances for the Interstate Commerce Commission. In 1907 Hine assisted in the revising the business methods of the Department of the Interior at Washington, D.C. Then he was appointed bankruptcy receiver of the Washington, Arlington & Falls Church Electric Railway.\n\nIn 1910, Hine became temporary special representative of President Taft, planning ways to improve the organization and methods of the executive departments of the United States government. Meantime, in July, 1908, he had become special representative of Mr. Julius Kruttschnitt, director of maintenance and operation of the Harriman Lines, and had entered on a study of the needs of the operating organization of those railways and of the means that should be adopted to meet those needs. This report led most of the Harriman Lines to adopt the unit system of organization.\n\nOn January 15, 1912, Major Hine became vice-president and general manager of the Southern Pacific Lines in Mexico and the Arizona Eastern, responsible for about 1,600 miles of railway.\n\nDuring World War I, on August 5, 1917, Hine (then living in New York City) was drafted to serve as Colonel of Infantry for New York's National Guard. Hisunit was sent overseas, and participated at St. Mihiel before the war ended and he was honorably discharged on January 10, 1919.\n\nHine died in Manhattan in 1927. After a funeral at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in which pall bearers included the President of the Lackawanna Railroad, Orlando Harriman Jr. and various distinguished military officers, he was interred at Arlington National Cemetery, and his widow awarded a pension based on his military service.\n\nIn the 1912 article \"The unit system on the Harriman Lines\" in the \"Engineering Magazine\" Hine wrote:\n\nOrganization has been termed a smaller sister of sociology, the science of human nature. Industrial organization, including that of transportation and commerce, reflects and typifies in a greater or less degree the sociological development of a people.\"\n\nHis series of articles were republished in the 1912 book, entitled \"Modern Organization: An Exposition of the Unit System.\" In this work Hine also stated: \nThe greatest present need is an antidote for the unwillingness of men to profit by the previous experience of others. It would be amusing, were it not so expensive, to watch the gropings of many corporation officers for methods to test efficiency. Ignorant of fundamental principles, intolerant of outside suggestions, unable to detect the analogy in other undertakings, they repeat the expensive experiments of the past.\n\nA 1913 review in the \"Journal of Accountancy\" stated that Hines was \"a firm believer in the personal equation in industry, commerce and all departments of business. Basing his argument to a great extent upon the successful operation of the unit system as applied on the so-called \"Harriman lines\" he goes step by step through the ideal method of management and operation to what he considers the practical solution of the difficulties which he encounters.\"\n\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from: Hine, Charles De Lano. \"Letters from an Old Railway Official: Second Series.

Exchange rate risk (also known as foreign exchange risk, FX risk, or currency risk) is especially high in periods of high currency volatility.\n\nCurrency analytics are technology tools that enable global companies to manage the risk associated with currency volatility. Currency analytics often involve automation that helps companies access and validate currency exposure data and make decisions that mitigate currency risk.\n\nCurrency volatility can impact a company’s balance sheet and/or cash flow. Corporate currency analytics help companies manage currency risk in both areas.\n\nIn the process of remeasuring transaction currency monetary assets and liability account balances, the difference between the exchange rate when the transaction was posted and exchange rate when the transaction was cleared goes to the functional entity’s income statement as an FX gain or loss. Then in the process of translating the functional entity’s income statement for the reporting entity’s consolidated income statement, that FX gain/loss gets translated at current income statement rate to reporting currency and appears on the consolidated income statement.\n\nManaging balance sheet risk can involve organic (natural) hedging such as using cash positions or intercompany loans to create exposure offsets. It can also involve external hedging such as buying a forward contract to offset FX exposure.\n\nIn both cases, efficient hedging depends on being able to drill down into the balance sheet to see the currencies of the transactions sitting on the company’s books around the world. Currency analytics automates that drill-down process and presents balance sheet exposure data in an easy-to-use dashboard that allows companies to efficiently manage balance sheet risk and minimize FX gain/loss.\n\nIn the process of translating the functional entity’s income statement, revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and operating expenses (OpEx) get translated at the current income statement rate to reporting currency and appear on the consolidated income statement. Currency impact to revenue, COGS, and OpEx arises from differences between the current income statement rate and the forecasted rate.\n\nManaging cash flow risk is fundamentally about protecting the economic value of the company’s future flow of cash from being eroded by currency volatility. It can involve organic (natural) hedging such as pricing contracts in a particular currency. It can also involve external hedging, but accounting rules require matching hedges to forecasted cash flows and don’t allow hedging economic risk.\n\nCurrency analytics allow companies to mitigate cash flow risk by uncovering accounting exposures to match the economic exposures so the company can hedge the accounting exposure as a proxy. Currency analytics enable what/if scenario analysis so companies can model how volatility in particular currencies could impact their revenue and expenses in the future.\n"}

While many consider these areas outside of downtown proper, they are generally considered more geographically proximate to Downtown Oakland than to East Oakland, North Oakland or to West Oakland and are thus sometimes associated with Downtown Oakland.\n\nDowntown Oakland hosts the only celebration of its kind in the nation in memory of the black cowboys who helped settle the American West. The annual parade typically begins on an early October weekend at DeFremery Park in West Oakland en route to Frank H. Ogawa Plaza where judging booths are set up. After an awards ceremony, the parade returns to DeFremery Park, for a celebration.\n\nDowntown Oakland is home to apartment and condominium dwellers, numerous retail businesses, tall modern office buildings, shorter mixed-use historic buildings, the hubs of AC Transit and BART, which has three underground stations, the city's official Entertainment District which includes the historic Paramount and Fox Theatres, nightclubs, and restaurants, the headquarters of Clorox, City Center, a portion of Old Oakland, and a portion of Chinatown.\n\nDowntown includes a portion of the oldest part of the city. The area from the Oakland Estuary inland to 14th Street between West Street and the Lake Merritt Channel was the original site of Oakland, and there are several 19th century houses scattered around the edges of downtown and in Chinatown. The Oakland Museum is located on Oak Street near the southeastern edge of Downtown.\n\nLaney College, with more than 12,000 students, is located on Fallon Street near the Lake Merritt BART station. Other educational institutions include Lincoln University, a small business school catering mainly to international students, and a downtown office of Cal State East Bay. Oaksterdam University, a business college which prepares students for medical cannabis work, is located on 15th Street in an area referred to as \"Oaksterdam\".\n\nThe original campus of UC Berkeley was located between Franklin, Harrison, 12th and 14th streets; and the University of California system is currently headquartered in Downtown.\n\nLincoln Elementary School, one of the few public elementary schools in the downtown of a major US city, is on the edge of downtown, near the center of Chinatown. The Oakland School for the Arts, a charter school, is building a new facility surrounding the Fox Oakland Theatre in Oakland's Uptown Oakland.\n\nCity Hall Plaza is a city park and a \"pedestrian plaza\" which includes what was once the terminus of San Pablo Avenue where it met Broadway at 14th Street. It also includes 15th Street, which once ran through what is now \"Kahn's Alley,\" past 250 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza building, across Clay Street, through what is now a glass windowed lobby of the California State office building, connecting with Jefferson Street on the building's west side entrance. Motor vehicle traffic has also been excluded from where former city streets, Washington street and 13th street, were once aligned through what is now the Oakland City Center development. Today the area features an outdoor retail mall with pedestrian streets laid out to replicate the original street grid.\n\nSeveral routes operated by AC Transit pass by or end at Downtown Oakland. These include:\n\nLocal Routes\n\nTransbay Route\n\nAll-Nighter Routes (all routes meet at Broadway and 14th Street)\n\nTransit passengers traveling in and out of Downtown are serviced by AC Transit's downtown bus station at 14th and Broadway, and Uptown Regional Transit Center bus mall on nearby Thomas L. Berkeley Way (20th Street) is now in full farebox service, and features multiple bus shelters with seating, NextBus arrival prediction signs, local and Rapid Bus service to Oakland's streetcar suburbs. These stations host local service, Rapid service, Transbay Express, and All Nighter service. A Translink Add Value Machine is located at AC Transit Headquarters on Franklin Street.\n\nThe \"1\" line which connects to East Oakland and San Leandro via International Blvd. and California State Route 185 and terminates at the San Leandro BART station, runs through downtown along 12th Street. The transformation of the \"1\" line into a full scale bus rapid transit corridor is years into the planning process. The most substantial planning alternative proposed for this system would feature articulated buses with five to six doors at boarding platform level, a separated bus-only lane, center median platforms in many areas with proof-of-payment ticket machines to speed boarding, and signalization priority to allow bus drivers to change traffic lights in passengers favor.\n\nThree underground BART stations are located in Downtown: 12th Street/Oakland City Center and 19th Street are both on Broadway, and Lake Merritt is in the eastern area of Chinatown on Madison Street.\n\nThe Downtown Oakland and Lake Merritt/Uptown District Associations are community benefit districts that were formed in February 2009. Property owners in both Downtown Oakland and the Lake Merritt/Uptown Districts voted by a margin of almost 8 to 1 to support a voluntary property tax to fund services that would improve the quality of life in their respective communities. The associations meet and function jointly. Services funded by these Districts include maintaining cleanliness and order in the public rights of way, improving district identity and advocating on behalf of the area's property owners, business owners and residents. In June 2013, the districts were recognized by the International Downtown Association (IDA) and named the IDA's June Downtown of the Month.\n\nThe district boards have three organizational committees, including the DISI (District Identity and Street Improvement) Committee, the SOBO (Sidewalk Operations, Beautification & Order) Committee and the Joint ORG (Organization) Committee. The DISI Committee promotes the identity of the districts, encourages economic development and works to createa vibrant downtown through public relations, marketing, and special events. The SOBO Committee oversees cleanliness and order in the public rights of way and manages service providers in keeping with the expectations of our organization and the needs of the community. Through diligent planning and thoughtful allocation of resources, the SOBO committee executes projects that effectively beautify and enhance the safety of the districts for the long term, creating vibrant and celebrated public spaces. And lastly, the Joint Organization Committee oversees the general administration of the corporations, ensures the effective operationsof the board, acts as the coordinating framework through which the other committees function efficiently, and works to increase involvement and supportfor the organizations.\n\nThe districts have helped fund several neighborhood beautification/improvement projects & initiatives including: The Latham Square pedestrian plaza, back of BART planter boxes, hanging flower baskets & banners and median landscaping projects, to name a few.\n\nThe Downtown Oakland Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The listing included 43 contributing buildings, one contributing site and one contributing object.\n\nOther historic districts have been designated in Old Oakland: the Lakeside Apartments district, Preservation Park, and the Waterfront Warehouse district.\n\n"}

{"id": "24983367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24983367", "title": "Francisco Macri", "text": "Francisco Macri\n\nFrancesco \"Franco\" Macri (born 15 April 1930) is an Italian Argentine businessman and father of the Argentine president Mauricio Macri.\n\nFranco Macri was born in Rome, to Giorgio Macri and Lea Garbini. His mother belonged to a prosperous local family, proprietors of an intercity bus service and supporters of Fascist Dictator Benito Mussolini. His father, in turn, was born to a family of fallen nobility from the Calabria Region of Italy. Opponents of \"il Duce\", their kinship to the powerful Pellicano clan allowed them to retain a small postal service carrier in the area around San Giorgio Morgeto. The eight-year-old Franco and his two younger siblings were sent to a military school in 1938, following their parents' divorce two years earlier, a common fate for the children of divorced couples under Italian Fascism; they were reunited with their father in Genoa five years later.\n\nThe birth of the Italian Republic prompted Giorgio Macri to enter politics, by which he co-founded a nationalist party, \"L'Uomo Qualunque\" (\"The Common Man\"), ahead of the general elections in June 1946; following the party's poor showing, however, he departed for Buenos Aires, settling in the western suburb of San Justo. He later obtained housing in the Eva Perón Foundation's Ciudad Evita community, and was joined by his three children in January 1949. Franco Macri found work in as a construction laborer; he was promoted quickly and held an administrative post within a year, later earning his secondary school diploma at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires and, in 1950, establishing a construction firm, Urbana.\n\nObtaining a number of small, public contracts, Urbana ultimately failed, and Macri entered into a partnership, Vimac, in 1953. The firm was boosted by a lucrative contract from Loma Negra, the leading Argentine cement producer, for the construction of a new plant near Tandil in 1955. He married Alicia Blanco Villegas, the daughter of a prominent Tandil physician, in 1958, relocated to Mar del Plata, and had the first of their four children, Mauricio, in 1959.\n\nMacri started a home builder, Demaco, and purchased a tony Buenos Aires apartment facing Vicente López Plaza (in the heart of the upscale Recoleta district). The 1962 installation of ultraconservative Economy Minister Alvaro Alsogaray, however, and the latter's policy of paying state contractors and employees with worthless \"Ninth of July Bonds\" led to Vimac's closure.\n\nJoined by two investors and aided by an economic recovery, in 1964 he fused Demaco with the remains of Vimac to establish Impresit-Sideco. The firm secured a coveted contract with Italian automaker Fiat, for the construction and maintenance of their Caseros factory, and quickly became a leading public works contractor, notably in the construction of the General Belgrano Bridge, the Atucha I and Embalse nuclear power plants (Latin America's first), as well as in private works, such as an AGIP gas pipeline and the Catalinas Norte office park.\n\nInheriting his father's interest in film (the elder Macri had worked for the iconic Cinecittà Studios), he also established MBC, which produced cinema for local directors Leopoldo Torre Nilsson and Alejandro Doria, among others.\n\nHaving had completed over 30 major public works projects worth over US$1.8 billion since 1964, Macri acquired Philco and NEC's Argentine affiliates and gained controlling interest in Impresit and established Socma, a holding company for his various interests, in 1976. The installation of the last dictatorship that year, and their appointment of Buenos Aires Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore led to the closure of the city's tens of thousands of apartment building incinerators, whose noxious disposal of the city's 3,000 daily tons of refuse had been worsening air quality for decades. Cacciatore had them replaced in 1979 with curbside pickup service awarded to \"Manliba\", a consortium between Impresit-Sideco and Waste Management, Inc.\n\nMacri's marriage ended in separation in 1980 (no provision existed in Argentina for divorce until 1987), and in 1982 he married Cristina Cressier, with whom he had his sixth child, Florencia. The collapse of the Argentine auto industry in 1981-82 allowed Macri to purchase a controlling stake in Sevel Argentina S.A., a local joint venture between Fiat and Peugeot formed in 1980. The acquisition averted the closure of the European automakers' Argentine plants, and tripled Socma's income.\n\nMacri's finances were undermined, however, from losses stemming from the Banco de Italia y Río de la Plata, of which he was majority shareholder between 1975 and 1980. The subsequent crisis, which resulted from the implosion of Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz's financial deregulation and strong peso policies, also prompted Macri to take advantage of an exchange rate guarantee enacted by the Central Bank in 1980 for large private borrowers facing sharply higher U.S. dollar payments, a benefit granted to Sevel.\n\nHe entered into a valuable real estate venture in New York, when in 1979, developer Abraham Hirschfeld sold him a 75% stake in 30 hectares (75 acres) of Hudson Riverfront land formerly owned by Penn Central. Planning to develop \"Lincoln West,\" a residential complex, Macri invested US$100 million in mandated public works and related expenses, but could not, ultimately, service a Chase Manhattan loan or meet the city's myriad zoning demands, selling the land to Donald Trump in 1985 for US$117 million.\n\nThe disappointment was compounded by a heart attack in 1983, and the end of his second marriage in 1986, by which he lost custody of Florencia. He suffered serious losses during the country's repeated currency crises between 1987 and 1990, but gained from a partnership with BellSouth and Motorola to form Movicom, the first large-scale Argentine mobile phone service provider.\n\nA supporter of La Rioja Province Governor Carlos Menem ahead of his upset victory in the 1988 Justicialist Party primaries, Macri broke from the flomboyant President when, after his 1989 election (which he won on a populist platform), he pursued aggressive free trade policies that undermined Sevel (by then the largest automaker in Argentina) in favor of cheaper imports. Carlos Grosso, Menem's appointed Mayor of Buenos Aires (a presidential prerogative until 1996), was a managerial employee of Macri's. A vocal Peronist, Grosso had reportedly been spared becoming one of the \"disappeared\" upon his 1978 military abduction only by Macri's appeal on his behalf to Internal Affairs Minister Albano Harguindeguy and Apostolic Nuncio Pio Laghi.\n\nThe family was shaken by the August 23, 1991, kidnapping of Mauricio Macri, Franco Macri's eldest son. Freed after two weeks in captivity for a reported ransom of US$6 million, Macri's abduction was executed by four members of the Policía Federal Argentina, which has policing purview over Buenos Aires (the perpetrators were located only a decade later).\n\nSevel, the Socma Group's centerpiece at the time, initially benefitted from the boom touched of by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's Convertibility Plan in 1991, seeing its auto sales grow from 30,000 in 1990 to 200,000 in 1994. The local auto industry was hit hard, however, by the Mexican peso crisis. A fall in sales to 130,000 led the company to divest itself of the Fiat licence in 1996, and Sevel revenues fell by nearly half, to US$1.1 billion. During the Menem-era wholesale privatization drive, Macri was outmaneuvered in a 1997 bid for the management of the nation's 33 main airports by Eduardo Eurnekian, though Socma was sold the national postal service in July 1997. Sevel was eventually liquidated, rescinding its Peugeot licence in March 2000, well into the Argentine economic crisis, and the Socma Group's global revenues fell from US$4.5 billion in 1994 to US$2 billion in 2001. Following Sevel's liquidation, Macri was convicted of customs duty evasion relating to an auto export-import scheme via neighboring Uruguay.\n\nMacri, a fan of the Boca Juniors football club since the 1950s, has had a commercial relationship with it for almost as long, dating from his 1960 partnership in a small insurance firm with the club's president at the time, Alberto Armando. He leveraged this to promote his elder son, Mauricio, as president of the club in 1992, though he was defeated by the incumbent, Antonio Alegre (credited with saving the club from insolvency in the 1980s). Macri was elected in 1995, however, and caused controversy by earmarking a multi-million dollar renovation of the \"Bombonera\" stadium, and granting the contract to Impresit (Macri's construction firm).\n\nFlorencia, Macri's youngest daughter, was kidnapped on April 30, 2003, and freed a week later after a ransom of nearly a million dollars was reportedly paid. The federal postal service contract with Socma, through \"Correos Argentinos\", was rescinded, citing the company's debt to taxpayers of US$296 million. \"Pago Fácil\", the electronic funds transfer service operated by Socma, became one of the group's leading firms, processing over 7 million payments a month. Among the group's most significant real estate developments after 2004 was the Mulieris towers, in Buenos Aires' Puerto Madero district.\n\nMacri returned to the auto industry in 2007, when he obtained licensing to produce Chery automobiles, as well as their parts, which would be assembled in Uruguay. His son, Mauricio, was elected Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2007, and in 2008, the 78-year-old Macri divested Socma of two of its most important firms, Iecsa (construction) and Creaurban (real estate), in favor of Angelo Calcaterra, his nephew. Chery Socma, the joint venture with the Chinese automaker, exported its first units in September 2009.\n\nMacri published a reflection on his over half-century as an Argentine businessman, \"El futuro es posible\", in 2004; he still keeps the suitcase with which he arrived in Argentina in 1949.\n\nIn April 2016, following the leak to German newspaper \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" of 11 million documents belonging to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, the leaked Panama Papers revealed that Macri was listed as director of a Bahamas-based trading company that he did not disclose during his tenure as Mayor of Buenos Aires. Shortly after the Panama Papers made the news, Macri appeared in a short TV interview in which he said his father, Franco Macri, had founded the company through a \"legal operation\". He added that the company had been intended to carry out investment operations in Brazil but the business was never completed.\n\nJournalist Joaquín Morales Solá considered it unlikely that Macri would be prosecuted for the Panama revelations. Macri appears himself in the directory, Franco Macri had reported it to the AFIP, and it was closed in 2008, just a year after Mauricio Macri became chief of government.\n\nOn April 7, 2016, federal prosecutor Federico Delgado began a formal investigation into Macri's involvement with Fleg Trading Ltd., the company registered in Panama for which President Macri was listed as director. Judge Sebastián Casanello was asked to start the file on the inquiry. The initial petition was made by Norman Martínez, deputee for the Front for Victory. Martínez claims Macri could be guilty of perjury due to omissions made in his sworn statement. Martínez also referenced another offshore company, Kagemusha SA, which had been established in 1981 and to which President Macri also had connections.\n"}

The latter proposal would have required the demolition of the Colosseum. Gould suggested this diagonal street be called Little High Street, in reference to the diagonal High Street further south in the central city. Only two weeks after Gould's proposal, a group of businessman led by Arthur Francis Stacey put a proposal for a new street with a Spanish theme to Christchurch City Council's town planning committee. The group had secured options on the Colosseum and on those two properties that separated the Colosseum from access onto Armagh Street. New Regent Street is what came from Stacey's proposal.\n\nHe died on 26 May 1941 in Christchurch. His sister Mabel, the widow of the Hon. Henry A. Hannen (himself the son of James Hannen, Baron Hannen), died in the same week.\n"}

His great-grandfather Charles was a member of the Kingdom of Italy and was the brother of Senator Giovanni Battista Giorgini and brother-in-law of Vittoria Manzoni, the eighth daughter of Alessandro Manzoni. His father, Vittorio Giorgini (1860-1919) helped his brother Alessandro in the family business dedicated to the marble trade, but he had an artistic spirit. The mother, Florence Rochat (1860-1942) was Waldensian and originally from Francophone Switzerland. The boy grew up in a cultured and cosmopolitan environment and undertook classical studies at the University of Pisa.\n\nAt the age of 17, he followed his family footsteps and enrolled as a volunteer in infantry to participate in the First World War. Impressed by the horrors of the war promoted the Christian Youth Association, equivalent to the evangelical organization \"Young Men's Christian Association\" (YMCA).\n\nIn 1921 he married Zaira Augusta Nanni with whom he had three children: Graziella, Vittorio and Matilde.\n\nThe following year he moved to Florence where he decided to start his own business by opening the \"GB Giorgini & Co. Import-export\" in via Calzaioli 9. He actively promotes Tuscan art, antiques and crafts, and in 1924 he will make his first commercial trip to the United States. This trip was particularly painful because at the time Italian exporters were not well seen overseas. He decided to develop contacts with the \"Italian House of Columbia University\", \"Italy America Society\" and the YMCA and at the same time he selected a high quality Italian craftsmanship.\n\nThe crack of 1929 gave a heavy blow to his work and forced him to close his New York office. The years that followed were very unstable until the end of the Second World War , when the allies entrusted him with the management of the \"Allied Forces Gift Shop\" of Florence, a pole in charge of selling products to Anglo-American troops. In those years he quickly resumed contact with all the Italian artisans with whom he had worked before the war, and of course with the American buyers.\n\nSkillful businessman immediately sees the potential of Italian fashion, then almost unknown in the world. Everything took place in Paris, where the few non-French designers opened their Ateliers ( Cristobal Balenciaga , Elsa Schiaparelli , etc.). Giovanni Battista Giorgini took the initiative to organize the \"First Italian High Fashion Show\" at his private residence in Florence at Villa Torrigiani. The parade was held February 12, 1951 in the presence of six major American buyers, who, as he himself said in various interviews, went to Florence as a simple courtesy visit. It was: Gertrude Ziminsky for B. Altman and Company of New York, John Nixon for Henry Morgan of Montreal, Ethel Francau, Jessica Daves and Julia Trissel for Bergdorf Goodman of New York, Stella Hanania for I. Magnin of San Francisco. Giorgini had planned to present 18 models of 10 Italian fashion houses. Among those who presented their models there were: the atelier Carosa (of the princess Giovanna Caracciolo), Alberto Fabiani , the atelier Simonetta (of the Duchess Simonetta Colonna Visconti ), Emilio Schuberth the Sorelle Fontana , Jole Veneziani , the tailor Vanna (of Manette Valente), Vita Noberasko and Germana Marucelli . They were added for theprêt-à-porter Emilio Pucci , Giorgio Avolio, The weaver of the Island (of the baroness Clarette Gallotti) and Mirsa (of the marquise Olga of Gresy). Giorgini's resourcefulness, the quality of the products, the buyers' reputation and the support of some journalists like Irene Brin , who as Italian editor for Harper's Bazaar advertised the event overseas, decreed its success.\n\nIt was a very exceptional event, because from that moment it really began to talk about Italian fashion. The second parade was held in July 1951 in the halls of the \"Grand Hotel\" in Florence. Since 1952, two seasons of fashion shows have been organized in the Sala Bianca of Palazzo Pitti , one in January and the other in July. In 1954 the Florence Center for Italian fashion was born, with its first director Mario Vannini Parenti.\n\nIn the 1960s, he succeeded in conquering the Japanese market, selling Italian creations to \"Isetan\", one of the most important department stores in the country. Sensing also the importance of prêt-à-porter manages to introduce him in the Florentine fashion shows, but this will be a cause of conflict with the great Roman fashion houses that will decide in 1967 to create Haute Couture fashion shows directly in Rome.\n\nGiorgini died on January 2, 1971 in Florence, at Villa Torrigiani (that of the Torrigiani Garden), and was buried in the Cemetery of the Allori in via Senese.\n\nHis personal archive was filed in 2005 by his nephew Neri Fadigati at the Florence State Archives.\n\n"}

He was adopted in 1945 by Margarita Companc de Pérez Acuña, a local socialite, and enrolled at the La Salle college preparatory school, though he left before graduating. He married Maria del Carmen \"Munchi\" Sundblad Beccar Varela, an heiress, in 1964, and in 1968, was named director of the Banco Río de La Plata (at the time of the country's largest, private-sector banks), following its purchase by his family. He built much of his fortune, however, as head of Petrolera Pérez Companc, a family-based conglomerate in oil and gas that was first established by Gregorio's adoptive father in 1946.\n\nPérez Companc purchased a controlling stake in Banco Río de la Plata from his siblings in 1993, and would sell his shares to Spanish banking giant Banco Santander in 1997. Between 1990 and 1994, the company expanded its domestic activities in the oil business and in a number of other industries through participation in the country's privatization programme initiated by President Carlos Menem. By 1996, Pérez Companc S.A. had consolidated sales of US$1.41 billion. The family strengthened its hand in 1998 by forming a new public holding company, PC Holdings S.A., and later that year, acquired a 68% share in local food giant Molinos Río de la Plata from the traditional agribusiness house, Bunge y Born, for US$380 million. Molinos Río de la Plata, which sells Luchetti's pasta, Cocinero oils and Nobleza Gaucha yerba mate (among numerous brands), is one of Argentina's leading processed foods companies, earning roughly US$850 million in revenues in 2009.\n\nIn 1999, shareholders in Pérez Companc S.A. exchanged their voting shares for nonvoting shares (Class B shares) in PC Holdings S.A.: this raised some concern from financial and political analyst, since in such a transaction the controlling shareholders would have multiple vote shares to ensure their continuing voting control. However, the Comision Nacional de Valores approved the exchange, thus allowing the Pérez Companc family to own 58% of the company with 80% voting control. The Argentine economic crisis produced numerous problems for the country's energy sector, and 1999 revenues for Petrolera Pérez Companc declined 3% to US$1.27 billion. The family also sold their 19% stake in Banco Río de la Plata during 1999. In a year that saw the Argentine economy shaken by the worst economic turmoil in over a century, Pérez Companc continued to oversee growth in the family's business concerns: the value of the group's consolidated energy, food processing and financial services portfolio grew a healthy 20% during 2001.\n\nHe scored a big coup in October 2002 when he announced the sale of the family's 60% share of Petrolera Pérez Companc to Brazilian oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) for a reported US$1 billion in cash and bonds.\n\nGregorio Pérez Companc and his wife, María del Carmen Sundblad Beccar Varela, have eight children Margarita, Jorge, Luis, Rosario, Pilar, Cecilia, Pablo and Catalina, with sons Luís and Jorge helping their parents run Molinos Río de la Plata. The family is deeply religious and have donated generously to Catholic Charities over the years. \n\nIn late 2007 Gregorio's sister-in-law, the well-known interior designer María-Migdalia Perez-Soto, died unexpectedly in her mansion in Coral Gables, leaving in question control over the Pérez Companc Investment Group. María-Migdalia, held an 80% stake in the group, with her untimely death, her eldest son Richard Rodriguez-Mendez obtained control and later dissolved it. Richard Rodriguez-Mendez did keep his mother's prized possession Interior Design Firm- Design by Interior's which is currently managed by Getty Designs and is estimated to be worth $600 million. In early 2010 Richard Rodriguez-Mendez reclaimed full control and ownership over the Rafael Rodriguez-Mendez Trust who died in 2009, its real estate portfolio alone was valued at $650 million. The long battle between brother's ended up with one brother receiving 3% of the estate and the recluse Richard Rodriguez-Mendez with the majority stake of 97%. \n\nSince 2010 the Rodriguez-Mendez Trust has grown in size, a conservative estimate puts the Trust at somewhere between $1.7 billion dollars and $2.1 billion dollars but some believe that the Estate which is managed by 5 independent banking firm in name of Richard Rodriguez-Mendez and his 5 heirs put it in the $5 billion dollar range. A lot of question have arisen since it was announced the Rodriguez Mendez relapsed with throat cancer after a long battle of chemotherapy in 2000, It is not sure what the true estimate of the estate is worth due to the secrecy of the Rodriguez Trust and its all of Richard Rodriguez-Mendez heirs. While his grandmother sits atop with estimated worth of around $9.8 Billion dollar fortune, Rodriguez-Mendez controls and manages all his assets behind a shell of multiple banking firms and there is no indication that he has a Will and if so who will manage the estate that he has doubled in size. \n\nGregorio and his wife raise Jersey dairy cows and operate Munchi's, a small chain of ice cream parlors. Long known for his love of modern and vintage cars, he reportedly owns a Bugatti, a Maserati, a limited-edition Ferrari F50, and the unique Ferrari 330 TRI/LM racing car.\n\nGregorio is also the uncle of billionare heir Richard Rodríguez-Méndez and Roy Rodrigo Rodriguez Mendez by his aunt, María Carmen. Roy Rodrigo committed suicide on February 6, 2015, in his jail cell in Madrid, Spain where he was serving a 4 and-a-half years prison term. Richard Rodríguez-Méndez is an avid buyer of real estate, to date he owns 15 properties some of which are among the largest homes in the world. His real estate portfolio is estimated to be worth nearly $200 million; he also collects art: in his collection he has works by Pierre Bonnard's \"Terrasse a Vernon\" which sold for £7.2 million ($11.6 million) at an auction, as well as Cézanne's Portrait of Mme Cézanne. His private art collection also includes his great-grandmother's work Marie Spartali-Stillman, A Rose from Armida's Garden and other pieces, all valued at over $400 million.\n\n"}

LSA techniques include:\n\n\nFiber-optic cables are spliced using a special arc-splicer, with installation cables connected at their ends to respective \"pigtails\" - short individual fibers with fiber-optic connectors at one end. The splicer precisely adjusts the light-guiding cores of the two ends of the glass fibers to be spliced. The adjustment is done fully automatically in modern devices, whereas in older models this is carried out manually by means of micrometer screws and microscope. An experienced splicer can precisely position the fiber ends within a few seconds. Subsequently, the fibers are fused together (welded) with an electric arc. Since no additional material is added, such as gas welding or soldering, this is called a \"fusion splice\".\n\nDepending on the quality of the splicing process, attenuation values at the splice points are achieved by 0.3 dB, with good splices also below 0.02 dB. For newer generation devices, alignment is done automatically by motors. Here one differentiates core and jacket centering. At core centering (usually single-mode fibers), the fiber cores are aligned. A possible core offset with respect to the jacket is corrected. In the jacket centering (usually in multimode fibers), the fibers are adjusted to each other by means of electronic image processing in front of the splice.\n\nWhen working with good equipment, the damping value is according to experience at max. 0.1 dB. Measurements are made by means of special measuring devices including optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR). A good splice should have an attenuation of less than 0.3 dB over the entire distance.

Headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, the channel broadcasts regional coverage of sports events in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area.\n\nMASN is available on approximately 23 cable and fiber optic television providers in Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia, eastern and central North Carolina, West Virginia, south central Pennsylvania and Delaware (on providers such as Comcast, Cox Communications, RCN, Mediacom, Charter Communications and Verizon FiOS, covering an area stretching from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Charlotte, North Carolina); it is also available nationwide on satellite via DirecTV and Dish Network.\n\nWhen the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington, D.C., in 2004 to begin play as the Nationals in 2005, issues arose regarding television rights for the new franchise. The Orioles have had a sizable following in the Washington area since moving from St. Louis in 1954, and have claimed Washington as part of their home territory since the second Washington Senators franchise became the Texas Rangers in 1972. Since at least 1981, Major League Baseball had designated the Orioles' television territory as extending from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Charlotte, North Carolina. The Orioles agreed to share their territory with the Nationals in return for the ability to air Nationals games on the Orioles' planned regional sports network, to be named the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network. Major League Baseball, which owned the Expos-Nationals franchise from 2002 to 2006, paid the Orioles $75 million for a 10% stake in MASN, with the Orioles maintaining a controlling interest of 90%. As part of the deal, the Nationals' stake in the network would increase by one percent per year to 33% over 23 years, at which point the increases would cease and ownership would be fixed at 67% Orioles and 33% Nationals. Under the arrangement, MASN paid the Nationals $20 million to broadcast their games in 2005, and were bound to renegotiate the amount they paid the Nationals based on the fair market value of the Nationals′ broadcast rights in 2012 and once every five years thereafter. With this settled, the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network launched on April 4, 2005.\n\nThe family of Lerner Enterprises founder Ted Lerner subsequently became part-owners in MASN after their purchase of the Washington Nationals in July 2006. The same month that the Lerners acquired minority interest in MASN, the network, which originally broadcast only during Orioles and Nationals games, converted into a 24-hour channel with an expanded roster of collegiate sports events and local and national programming. It has become a strong competitor to the area's dominant regional sports network, Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic, now known as NBC Sports Washington.\n\nAs a whole, the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network televises more than 600 professional and NCAA Division I collegiate events annually.\n\nThe network carries live telecasts of all Orioles and Nationals games that are not televised by a national broadcast or cable network, and produces the pre-game and post-game shows \"Nats Xtra\" and \"O's Xtra\", which bookend the game telecasts. As with all Major League Baseball broadcasts, MASN-produced games are available for streaming out of the teams' respective territories at mlb.tv, with local viewers able to watch highlights for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of each game.\n\nThrough the 2017 season, MASN also produced over-the-air television broadcasts of Nationals and Orioles games for television stations in their respective primary markets – producing Nationals games seen on CBS affiliate WUSA-TV (channel 9) in Washington and Orioles games seen on CBS owned-and-operated station WJZ-TV (channel 13) in Baltimore. Those games were shown on MASN in all of the network's territory, including the Baltimore and Washington markets.\n\nFrom 2008 through 2013, MASN used five broadcasters to provide simultaneous coverage of the annual Beltway Series between the Orioles and the Nationals, using the network's on-air staffs in an unconventional \"mixed-booth\" arrangement whenever the Orioles and Nationals played one another. Each team was represented by a color analyst and two sideline reporters for their respective telecasts, with play-by-play announcers each broadcasting for half of the game. The games were simulcast on both MASN channels (MASN and MASN2). Beginning in 2014, MASN dropped the mixed-booth format and returned to maintaining separate broadcast streams for each team during the Beltway Series, with the broadcast teams for each team again segregated as in conventional broadcasts, the home team′s feed carried on MASN, and the visiting team′s feed on MASN2.\n\nThe network televises 275 collegiate sporting events each year from NCAA Division I teams in football, basketball and lacrosse. MASN serves as the regional cable television home of Georgetown Hoyas and George Mason Patriots basketball games, as well as Big East and Big South basketball and football, and Colonial Athletic Association basketball games, the annual BB&T Classic and coaches shows for regional NCAA teams.\n\nIt also serves as an independent regional sports network, carrying a sizeable amount of college sports programming distributed by various syndicators including college basketball games from the Atlantic-10 Conference, America East Conference, Big 12 Conference, Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference, Northeast Conference and Southern Conference; college football games from the American Athletic Conference, Ivy League and the Sunbelt Conference; and games from the American Athletic Conference, Big South Conference, Conference USA, Mid-American Conference, Patriot League and Western Athletic Conference in both sports.\n\nIn addition to nationally distributed college sports events, MASN carries other national programming from Fox Sports Networks including golf and outdoor programs, horse racing, poker, and NASCAR events. In 2010, MASN relaunched \"The John Riggins Show\", a daily sports talk show hosted by the Washington Redskins hall of famer, who was previously with the network from 2006 to 2008. In addition to an afternoon drive program, Riggins hosted \"Riggo's Postgame Xtra\", which aired after each Redskins game.\n\nFrom 2006–2009, MASN began serving as the official regional cable broadcaster of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens, televising the team's preseason games, as well as nightly airings of team-related programming (including \"Ravens Xtra\", \"1 Winning Drive\", \"The John Harbaugh Show\", \"Ravens Report\", \"Game Plan\" and \"Purple Passion\") and original live post-game shows during the regular season.\n\nMASN served as an affiliate for the American Sports Network until it became Stadium in 2017.\n\nThe network also has a companion channel, MASN2, that airs overflow games in order to accommodate both baseball teams' schedules. In September 2013, MASN2 became an affiliate of Fox Sports Networks, although selected FSN-produced ACC games air on CSN Mid-Atlantic instead, and ESPNews still airs during overnight hours\n\nMASNHD is a high definition simulcast feed of MASN, which broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format. MASN announced that it would launch a full-time HD feed on September 16, 2008, and televise 200 Major League Baseball games in HD in 2009. Since 2010, MASN and MASN2 have televised every Orioles and Nationals game not aired on national television in high definition. In 2012, all sports telecasts on the network began to be letterboxed on the network's standard definition feed via the #10 Active Format Description tag format, with graphics framed for widescreen displays rather than the safe area; games produced by MASN on WDCW and WJZ-TV utilize 4:3-optimized graphics to accommodate standard definition viewers.\n\nAfter the Orioles agreed to share their television territory with the Nationals, another controversy arose with television rights. Comcast Sports Net Mid-Atlantic, the Orioles' cable partner since 1984, dating back to its days as Home Team Sports (which until 2000, was formerly co-owned with WJZ-TV under Group W and later CBS) maintained a ten-year cable television contract to broadcast Orioles games through the 2006 season. When MASN announced plans to move Orioles broadcasts to MASN, CSN Mid-Atlantic (by then, a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast) sued the Orioles seeking enforcement of a clause in its contract with the team, which Comcast SportsNet claimed allowed them the exclusive right of first and last refusal on future television contracts. MASN and the Orioles, however, claimed that MASN is a trade name for TCR Sports Broadcasting Holding, which was established in 1996 to sell all of the Orioles television rights, which resulted in the sale of the ten-year deal to HTS. Because of this, the Orioles and MASN claimed to be simply bringing their rights in-house.\n\nOn July 27, 2005, after argument by Baltimore attorney Arnold M. Weiner, Montgomery County Circuit Judge Durke G. Thompson threw out Comcast's lawsuit, ruling that the clause in Comcast's contract with the Orioles had not been triggered. Comcast filed an amended complaint and on October 5, Judge Thompson threw out Comcast's second effort.\n\nUp to that point, Comcast was the only major cable carrier that refused to carry MASN. However, as Comcast is the dominant cable provider in most of the Nationals and Orioles territory—including Baltimore and Washington themselves—this left most Nationals fans unable to see games without satellite. Additionally, Adelphia Communications – then in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings and therefore unable to reach new carriage deals – was in the process of being sold to Comcast and Time Warner Cable on a piecemeal basis. On August 4, 2006, following a settlement, it was announced that Comcast would carry MASN starting that September. Comcast was forced to drop its lawsuit under the terms of the deal. This cleared the way for the Orioles to move their games to MASN for the 2007 season.\n\nIn August 2008, MASN made a carriage complaint to the Federal Communications Commission after negotiations with Comcast did not result in a new contractual agreement. On December 23, 2009, Comcast and MASN finally settled their dispute over these systems, with the cable provider announcing plans to carry the network on systems that were not carrying it already \"as early as 2010\". The FCC complaint was dismissed that same day. On March 23, 2010, MASN announced that Comcast would begin carrying the network on its central Pennsylvania systems on March 31.\n\nTime Warner Cable, North Carolina's largest cable provider, never carried MASN on a basic cable tier on its North Carolina systems. This has resulted in the network airing a series of radio advertisements in the area asking TWC customers to ask the cable provider to add the network. On January 21, 2008, an FCC arbitrator ordered TWC to add MASN on its North Carolina systems, citing an argument that the provider was not carrying MASN in an effort to protect its own regional sports network Time Warner Cable Sports. Time Warner Cable appealed the decision to the FCC. On October 30, 2008, the FCC's Media Bureau denied the motions filed by Time Warner Cable in its appeal, and ordered TWC to put MASN on the analog tier of its North Carolina systems within 30 days.\n\nTWC filed another appeal for that decision, this time to the full commission. On January 16, 2009, the item was placed \"on circulation\" and remained there for almost two years. On December 20, 2010, the FCC voted 4-1 to grant Time Warner Cable's petition for review and reversed the Media Bureau's order. In the Memorandum Opinion and Order, it was revealed that in addition to offering carriage to MASN on a digital basic tier, TWC had \"inquired into MASN's willingness to agree to carriage of MASN on an analog tier only in its Eastern North Carolina systems\". This information seemed to expose TWC's apparent willingness to carry MASN on an analog tier on its systems in the Triangle and Wilmington areas, where the Nationals and Orioles are the only \"local\" teams designated by Major League Baseball. In the remaining home markets that are shared with the Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds—including Charlotte and the Piedmont Triad—MASN would be carried on a digital basic tier, which is the same level of service where some Braves' games are carried.\n\nHowever, MASN insists on analog coverage in all areas. As a result, Time Warner Cable refused to carry the network in North Carolina. MASN's North Carolina footprint is limited to a few small cable systems scattered across the state, mostly in areas that are part of the Hampton Roads market. This may change with TWC's acquisition by Charter Communications; indeed, Charter shut down Spectrum Sports, successor to Time Warner Cable Sports, in June 2017.\n\nAll games involving the Orioles and Nationals are blacked out in most of North Carolina from all other outlets including MLB Network, TBS, ESPN (for weekday games), MLB Extra Innings and MLB.tv.\n\nFibrant, a municipal fiber \"Internet service provider\" that serves Salisbury, North Carolina, carried MASN at one time, but by 2015 had removed MASN because MASN wanted to charge so much that Fibrant would have had to subscription raise its rates in order to keep MASN.\n\nMajor League Baseball and Angelos struck the deal to create MASN only days before the beginning of the 2005 season, before the completion of arrangements for Washington-area cable television providers to carry MASN′s two channels (MASN and MASN2). As a result of this, many Washington, D.C.-area fans initially did not receive the new network via their cable television providers and were unable to watch most Nationals games for some time during the Nationals′ first season, leading to frustration with the network among Nationals fans.\n\nSome Nationals fans contend that the majority ownership stake that Angelos and the Orioles hold in MASN leads the network to exhibit a bias in covering the Orioles compared to the Nationals, such as displaying the scores of Beltway Series games as \"Orioles vs. Washington\" – which critics see as sending a subtle message that the Orioles represent the entire Baltimore-Washington area, while the Nationals represent only Washington – as opposed to a more neutral \"Orioles vs. Nationals\" or \"Baltimore vs. Washington.\"\n\nWhen the amount MASN pays annually to the Nationals to broadcast Nationals games first came up for renegotiation in 2012, the Nationals asked for MASN to increase its annual payment to $118 million per year for the 2012 through 2016 seasons, while the Orioles countered with an offer averaging $39.5 million per year, arguing that the Nationals′ request was well above fair market value and in any case unaffordable for MASN, and it began paying the Nationals that amount in 2012 pending agreement between MASN and the Nationals on a fee. When MASN and the Nationals could not agree on an annual amount, the Orioles and Nationals submitted the matter to Major League Baseball′s Revenue-Sharing Definitions Committee for arbitration. The committee issued a written decision on June 30, 2014, that MASN should pay the Nationals an average of $59 million per year for 2012 through 2016. Claiming the decision was biased against the Orioles, MASN pursued litigation on behalf of the Orioles and itself to have the committee′s decision vacated. With the matter tied up in the courts, the entire 2012-2016 period went by without a resolution of the matter, and the teams missed the next required renegotiation for the seasons from 2017 through 2021. The Nationals seek payment from MASN of over $100 million in fees each for the 2012-2016 and 2017-2021 periods, The Nationals and some of their fans contend that the delay in MASN increasing the rights fees it pays Nationals has had a negative impact on the Nationals′ revenues and their ability to sign expensive free agents.\n\nThe \"Washington Post\" reported that the animosity between the teams over this dispute may have played a role in the Orioles postponing two of a three-game home series against the Chicago White Sox, playing the third game without allowing fans to attend, and moving a subsequent series with the Rays to Tampa Bay due to security concerns during the civil unrest in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray in April 2015. The Nationals were in the middle of a long road trip at the time, so Nationals Park would have been available as a nearby venue on short notice. Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred had suggested that possibility earlier in the week.\n\nAn Orioles spokesman would not comment on whether the teams' dispute affected the team's rescheduling decisions, but another source with the team told the \"Post\" that it had. The Nationals said that neither the Orioles nor MLB had approached them about making their stadium available. However, they never made the offer themselves.\n\n\n\n"}

The marriage ended in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn 1983 he was contracted to convert Kiwi Packaging's corrugator scheduling package Kiwiplan from Data General Business Basic to Fortran 77 on a Data General MV computer. He found that Fortran had fast number-crunching but slow disk access, difficult debugging and inability to share files without using system calls, and Business Basic had slow arithmetic and limited memory space, but easy debugging and convenient handling of file sharing. After leaving Kiwi Packaging he attempted to create a language which shared the virtues of both.\n\nB32 Business Basic took three years to write, but it was technically superior to Data General's Business Basic. Haszard expected that the world would beat a path to his door, but potential customers were conservative about using a new product, and doubtful that it could be supported from New Zealand. With the help particularly of George Henne and Maxon, a Toronto-based software reseller, B32 established a customer base and developed a reputation for performance in the Data General world.\n\nSelling and supporting B32 required frequent exhausting trips to North America and Europe. Haszard expanded his company with an extra support programmer, but B32 continued to grow and was ported to the Unix operating system. A sales and support branch of B32 Software opened in Blue Ash, Ohio in 1990, but the demands of running a business only increased. Haszard wasn't having fun any more, and when his chief competition, Transoft offered to buy him out, he accepted. B32 sold for US$800,000 in February 1992.\n\nHaszard's next venture was Binary Research, a company composed initially of former B32 employees. Binary Research's first product, a parallel file transfer utility, failed to reach break-even in the market, but led to the concept of a disk cloning program, Ghost.\n\nGhost was a huge success, coming just as Windows 95 created a demand for disk cloning. The huge growth of the Internet made software marketing and support around the world much simpler than before. A sales and support office in North America was set up, and a network of agents established around the world. Haszard brought in a business partner, Gray Treadwell, to help manage the business, and increased his programming staff manyfold. The stress of managing an international business became intolerable for Haszard, and he looked for a buyer for Ghost. Symantec purchased Ghost for US$27.5 million in July 1998. Most of the employees of Binary Research became employees of Symantec.\n\nHaszard set up Skunkworks Software with his remaining employees, producing a program called \"Focus\" which he describes as \"PowerPoint on steroids\". He also diversified from software into innovative aircraft propeller design. He was quoted in \"Unlimited\" magazine's November 2000 issue as saying \"I miss the adrenaline rush I had with Ghost and B32. There was a real fight for survival. I miss that.\"\n\nHaszard invested in the New Zealand technology company Ilion Technology, which sold highly purified lithium metal to battery manufacturers and was also developing its own advanced battery designs. Ilion Technology planned to list itself on the NASDAQ stockmarket in 2000, but was unable to do so due to the fall of the markets. Ilion was left with much higher expenditure than income, and no cash reserves. Haszard and other investors kept the company afloat while it was reorganised, and he stepped in when the previous chairman lost the confidence of shareholders. Despite further efforts to fund the company, Ilion Technology ceased operations in 2007 \n\nHaszard is the founder and chairman of Sprite Software, which makes software for backing up mobile devices and smart phones. Some of the other developers from Binary Research also work there.\n"}

{"id": "1906130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1906130", "title": "New Public Management", "text": "New Public Management\n\nNew Public Management (NPM) is an approach to running public service organizations that is used in government and public service institutions and agencies, at both sub-national and national levels. The term was first introduced by academics in the UK and Australia to describe approaches that were developed during the 1980s as part of an effort to make the public service more \"businesslike\" and to improve its efficiency by using private sector management models. As with the private sector, which focuses on \"customer service\", NPM reforms often focused on the \"...centrality of citizens who were the recipient of the services or customers to the public sector.\" NPM reformers experimented with using decentralized service delivery models, to give local agencies more freedom in how they delivered programs or services. In some cases, NPM reforms that used e-government consolidated a program or service to a central location to reduce costs. Some governments tried using quasi-market structures, so that the public sector would have to compete against the private sector (notably in the UK, in health care). Key themes in NPM were \"...financial control, value for money, increasing efficiency...,identifying and setting targets and continuance monitoring of performance, handing over.. power to the senior management\" executives. Performance was assessed with audits, benchmarks and performance evaluations. Some NPM reforms used private sector companies to deliver what were formerly public services.\n\nNPM advocates in some countries worked to remove \"...collective agreements [in favour of]...individual rewards packages at senior levels combined with short term contracts\" and introduce private sector-style corporate governance, including using a Board of Directors approach to strategic guidance for public organizations. While NPM approaches have been used in many countries around the world, NPM is particularly associated with the most industrialized OECD nations such as the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States of America. NPM advocates focus on using approaches from the private sector–the corporate or business world–which can be successfully applied in the public sector and in a public administration context. NPM approaches have been used to reform the public sector, its policies and its programs. NPM advocates claim that it is a more efficient and effective means of attaining the same outcome. \n\nIn NPM, citizens are viewed as \"customers\" and public servants are viewed as public managers. NPM tries to realign the relationship between public service managers and their political superiors by making a parallel relationship between the two. Under NPM, public managers have incentive-based motivation such as pay-for-performance, and clear performance targets are often set, which are assessed by using performance evaluations. As well, managers in an NPM paradigm may have greater discretion and freedom as to how they go about achieving the goals set for them. This NPM approach is contrasted with the traditional public administration model, in which institutional decision-making, policy-making and public service delivery is guided by regulations, legislation and administrative procedures. \n\nNPM reforms use approaches such as disaggregation, customer satisfaction initiatives, customer service efforts, applying an entrepreneurial spirit to public service, and introducing innovations. The NPM system allows \"the expert manager to have a greater discretion.\" \"Public Managers under the New Public Management reforms can provide a range of choices from which customers can choose, including the right to opt out of the service delivery system completely\".\n\nThe first practices of New Public Management emerged in the United Kingdom under the leadership of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher played the functional role of “policy entrepreneur\" and the official role of prime minister. Thatcher drove changes in public management policy in such areas as organizational methods, civil service, labor relations, expenditure planning, financial management, audit, evaluation, and procurement. Thatcher's successor, John Major, kept public management policy on the agenda of the Conservative government, leading to the implementation of the Next Steps Initiative. Major also launched the programs of the Citizens Charter Initiative, Competing for Quality, Resource Accounting and Budgeting, and the Private Finance Initiative.\n\nA term was coined in the late 1980s to denote a new (or renewed) focus on the importance of management and ‘production engineering’ in public service delivery, which often linked to doctrines of economic rationalism (Hood 1989, Pollitt 1993). During this timeframe public management became an active area of policy-making in numerous other countries, notably in New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden. At the same time, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established its Public Management Committee and Secretariat (PUMA), conferring to public management the status normally accorded more conventional domains of policy. In the 1990s, public management was a major item on President Clinton’s agenda. Early policy actions of the Clinton administration included launching the National Partnership and signing into law the Government Performance and Results Act. Currently there are few indications that public management issues will vanish from governmental policy agendas. A recent study showed that in Italy, municipal directors are aware of a public administration now being oriented toward new public management where they are assessed according to the results they produce.\n\nThe term New Public Management (NPM) expresses the idea that the cumulative flow of policy decisions over the past twenty years has amounted to a substantial shift in the governance and management of the “state sector” in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Scandinavia, and North America. A benign interpretation is that these decisions have been a defensible, if imperfect, response to policy problems. Those problems as well as their solutions were formulated within the policy-making process. The agenda-setting process has been heavily influenced by electoral commitments to improve macro- economic performance and to contain growth in the public sector, as well as by a growing perception of public bureaucracies as being inefficient. The alternative-generation process has been heavily influenced by ideas coming from economics and from various quarters within the field of management.\n\nAlthough the origins of NPM came from Westernized countries it expanded to a variety of other countries in the 1990s. Before the 1990s, NPM was largely associated to an idea utilized by developed countries that are particularly Anglo-Saxon. However the 1990s have seen countries in Africa, Asia and other countries looking into using this method. In Africa, downsizing and decrease of user fees have been widely introduced. These autonomous agencies within the public sectors have been established in these areas. Performance contracting became a common policy in crisis states worldwide. Contracting out of this magnitude can be used to do things such as waste management, cleaning, laundry, catering and road maintenance.\n\nNPM was accepted as the \"gold standard for administrative reform\" in the 1990s. The idea for using this method for government reform was that if the government guided private-sector principles were used rather than rigid hierarchical bureaucracy, it would work more efficiently. NPM promotes a shift from bureaucratic administration to business-like professional management. NPM was cited as the solution for management ills in various organizational context and policy making in education and health care reform.\n\nThe basic principles of NPM is can best be described when split into seven different aspects elaborated by Christopher Hood in 1991. Hood also invented the term NPM itself. They are the following:\n\nBecause of its belief in the importance and strength of privatizing government, it is critical to have an emphasis on management by engaging in hands-on methods. This theory allows leaders the freedom to manage freely and open up discretion.\n\nIts important to maintain explicit standards and measures of performance in a workforce. Using this method promotes clarification of goals/intent, targets, and indicators for progression.\n\nThe third point acknowledges the \"shift from the use of input controls and bureaucratic procedures to rules relying on output controls measured by quantitive performance indicators\". This aspect requires using performance based assessments when looking to outsource work to private companies/groups.\n\nNPM advocates often shifted from a unified management system to a decentralized system in which managers gain flexibility and are not limited to agency restrictions.\n\nThis characteristic focuses on how NPM can promote competition in the public sector which could in turn lower cost, eliminate debate and possibly achieve a higher quality of progress/work through the term contacts. Competition can also be found when the government offers contracts to the private sectors and the contract is given in terms of the ability to deliver the service effectively, quality of the goods provided, hence this will increase competition because the other private sector which did not get the contract will make strides to improve the quality and ability thereby facilitating competition.\n\nThis aspect focuses on the necessity to establish short-term labor contracts, develop corporate plans or business plans, performance agreements and mission statements. It also focuses on establishing a workplace in which public employees or contractors are aware of the goals and intention that agencies are trying to reach.\n\nThe most effective one which has led to its ascent into global popularity, focuses on keeping cost low and efficiency high. \"Doing more with less\" \nmoreover cost reduction stimulates efficiency and is one way which makes it different from the traditional approach of management\n\nNew Public Management draws practices from the private sector and uses them in the public sector of management. NPM reforms use market forces to hold the public sector accountable and the satisfaction of preferences as the measures of accountability. In order for this system to proceed, certain conditions, such as the existence of competition, must exist and information about choices must be available. Reforms that promise to reinvent government by way of focusing on results and customer satisfaction as opposed to administrative and political processes fail to account for legislative self-interest. Institutions other than federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinvention would not even be announced, except perhaps on hallway bulletin boards.\n\nThere are blurred lines between policymaking and providing services in the New Public Management system. Questions have been raised about the potential politicization of the public service, when executives are hired on contract under pay-for-performance systems. There are concerns that public managers may move away from trying to meet citizens' needs. NPM brings to question integrity and compliance when dealing with incentives for public managers. Questions such as managers being more or less faithful arise. The public interest is at risk and could undermine the trust in government. Accountability can be a big issue.\n\nAlthough NPM had a dramatic impact in the 1990s on managing and policymaking, many scholars believe that NPM has hit its prime. Scholars like Frank Dunleavy believe New Public Management is phasing out because of disconnect with “customers” and their institutions. Scholars cite the Digital Era and the new importance of technology that kills the necessity of NPM. In countries that are less industrialized the NPM concept is still growing and spreading. This trend has much to do with a country's ability or inability to get their public sector in tune with the Digital Era. New Public Management was created in the Public Sector to create change based on: disaggregation, competition, and incentives. Using incentives to produce the maximum services from an organization is largely stalled in many countries and being reversed because of increased complexity.\n\nPost-NPM, many countries explored digital era governance (DEG). Dunleavy believes this new way of governance should be heavily centered upon information and technology. Technology will help re-integrate with digitalization changes. Digital Era Governance provides a unique opportunity for self- sustainability however, there are various factors that will determine whether or not DEG can be implemented successfully. When countries have proper technology, NPM simply can't compete very well with DEG. DEG does an excellent job of making services more accurate, prompt and remove most barriers and conflicts. DEG also can improve the service quality and provide local access to outsourcers.\n\nNew Public Management is often mistakingly compared to New Public Administration. The ‘New Public Administration’ movement was one established in the USA during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Though there may be some common features, the central themes of the two movements are different. The main thrust of the New Public Administration movement was to bring academic public administration into line with a radical egalitarian agenda that was influential in US university campuses. By contrast, the emphasis of the New Public Management movement a decade or so later was firmly managerial in the sense that it stressed the difference that management could and should make the quality and efficiency of public services. It focuses on public service production functions and operational issues contrasted with the focus on public accountability, ‘model employer’ public service values, ‘due process,’ and what happens inside public organizations in conventional public administration. That meant New Public Management doctrines tended to be opposed to egalitarian ideas of managing without managers, juridical doctrines of rigidly rule-bound administration and doctrines of self-government by public-service professionals like teachers and doctors.\n\nThe table below gives a side-by-side comparison of the two systems core aspects/characteristics \n"}

His maternal grandparents were Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and American actress Grace Kelly. Casiraghi is eighth in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, following his twin cousins, his mother, brother Andrea, nephews Alexandre and Maximillian Casiraghi, and his niece India Casiraghi.\n\nCasiraghi was born in 5 September 1987 at Princess Grace Hospital Centre, in La Colle, Monaco. He is named after his maternal great-grandfather, Prince Pierre, Duke of Valentinois, his maternal grandfather, Prince Rainier III, and his father. His godparents are his uncle, Prince Albert II, and his aunt by marriage Laura Sabatini Casiraghi, the wife of his uncle Daniele. Casiraghi was three years old at the time of his father's death in a boating accident. He spent his earliest years, after his father's death, living at his mother's farmhouse in the quaint town of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.\n\nHe attended a state school in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. However, after his mother's remarriage to Ernst August, Prince of Hanover, the family moved to Fontainebleau, to be nearer to Paris and London, the latter being where his new stepbrothers lived with their mother. It is assumed that Casiraghi passed the French Baccalaureate exam in the summer of 2005 since he shortly afterwards began university. One year later, in fact, he moved to Milan to begin a three-year undergraduate course in International Economics and Management at Bocconi University. Besides French, he is fluent in Italian, English, and knows some German. He also plays the saxophone.\nFrom 30 January to 13 February 2007, Casiraghi accompanied his mother on a humanitarian tour of Africa. They visited Niger, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Africa on behalf of Princess Caroline's role as President of AMADE Mondiale.\n\nIn June 2009, Casiraghi became the majority shareholder of the Monaco-based construction company Engeco, which his father founded in 1984. His uncle Marco remains in the position of President over Engeco. The acquisition of the majority shares to Casiraghi's name was handled by the Milan-based legal firm Bird & Bird. Casiraghi is also the majority shareholder of Monacair.,\n\nCasiraghi is on the Management Committee of the Yacht Club de Monaco. In this capacity, he sponsored the “Sail for a Cause\" charity race, a cause which was organized by his cousin Leticia de Massy, using her social network LeSpot.Net to promote it. \"Sail for a Cause\" raises money for two charities: the Monaco Collectif Humanitaire and the Maison Notre Dame de Paix in Chad. The former funds surgeries for children around the world; the latter helps migrants.\n\nIn 2011, Casiraghi was inducted as an honorary member of the \"Jeune Chambre Economique de Monaco\" (JCEM).\n\nCasiraghi is a participant in the sport of inshore racing, which differs from offshore racing in that it is done along the coastlines. In January 2014, he was part of the Masarati team in the Cape2Rio competition. His team completed the journey from Cape Town to Rio in a record 10 days, 11 hours. 29 minutes, and 57 seconds. Casiraghi was a crew member of the Monaco Racing Fleet captained by Tommaso Chieffi which was first to cross the finish line in the 2013 edition of the Palermo-Monte Carlo Regatta. Casiraghi and the Monaco Racing Fleet also won the 10th edition of the Palmero-Monte Carlo race in August 2014., Casiraghi's boat, the \"Esimit Europa 2\", was the winner of the Giraglia Rolex Cup in June 2014.\n\nCasiraghi is the skipper of Team Malizia, the crew which sails a hydrofoil sailboat (also called a foiling catamaran) in the annual GC32 Racing Tour. Team Malizia takes its name from \"Il Malizia\", which means the Cunning, and which was the nickname assigned to Casiraghi's medieval ancestor François Grimaldi.\n\nIn August 2017, Casiraghi paired with Boris Herrmann to sail in the Fastnet Race. Starting at Cowes, moving up to Ireland and then back down to Devonshire, they finished the race in third place.\n\nCasiraghi is a fixture in the Monte-Carlo Historic Rally, a vintage car race that happens every year in January. However, in May 2014, he competed in a professional car race for the first time at the Volkswagen Scirocco R-Cup in Hockenheim. He was a celebrity guest starter in the race, driving car #26, and finished 22nd in the first race and 20th in the second race. He said he was encouraged to do the race by family friend and racing legend Jacky Ickx.\n\nIt is believed that he uses his economics degree towards learning the business of his father's companies, which are also managed by his uncle Marco.\n\nCasiraghi was linked to a number of young women during his university years in Milan, where he was photographed out and about with fashion models. \nCasiraghi has been in a relationship with the aristocratic journalist Beatrice Borromeo since May 2008. They were married in a civil ceremony on 25 July 2015 in the gardens of the Prince's Palace of Monaco. The religious ceremony took place on Isola Bella on 1 August 2015.\nPierre and Beatrice's first child, Stefano Ercole Carlo, was born on 28 February 2017. Their second child, Francesco Carlo Albert was born on 21 May 2018.\n\nIn February 2012, Casiraghi was briefly hospitalized following a physical altercation at a New York nightclub. According to media reports, Casiraghi approached the table of businessman Adam Hock, models Natasha Poly, Anja Rubik and Valentina Zelyaeva, whereby words were exchanged and an altercation ensued. Hock was arrested on four counts of assault, and is alleged to have struck Casiraghi as well as three male friends. Hock, who was charged on eight counts of misdemeanor assault, alleges that Casiraghi was the aggressor and that he assaulted Casiraghi and his companions in self-defence. Casiraghi was treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital for a laceration, bruising, and swelling of his face.\n"}
{"id": "3137400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3137400", "title": "Richard Bland Lee", "text": "Richard Bland Lee\n\nRichard Bland Lee (January 20, 1761 – March 12, 1827) was a planter, jurist, and politician from Fairfax County, Virginia. He was the son of Henry Lee II (1730–1787) of \"Leesylvania\" and Lucy Grymes (1734–1792), as well as a younger brother of both Maj. Gen. Henry (\"Light Horse Harry\") Lee (1756–1818) and of Charles Lee (1758–1815), Attorney General of the United States from 1795 to 1801, who served in both the Washington and Adams administrations.\n\nRichard Bland Lee the third son of Henry Lee II and Lucy Grymes was born on January 20, 1761 at \"Leesylvania\", the estate built by his father on land overlooking the Potomac River in Prince William County, Virginia. He was named after two distinguished relatives, his great-grandfather Richard Bland of \"Jordan's Point\", and his great-uncle, jurist and statesman Richard Bland, whom Thomas Jefferson called \"the wisest man south of the James\".\n\nPossibly educated as a youth at \"Chantilly\", the home of his venerated cousin Richard Henry Lee in Westmoreland County, Virginia, Richard was enrolled at the College of William and Mary in 1779. Though not directly involved in the Revolutionary war as his brother Henry Lee III was, Richard nevertheless took an active interest in the American cause. In June 1779 for example, Richard's uncle \"Squire\" Richard Lee of Lee Hall introduced a resolution in the House of Delegates that would authorize the building of a new statehouse. Though only eighteen years of age, Richard Bland Lee, in a letter written later that month, rebuked his famous uncle, characterizing the effort as \"abominable...[at a]...time of public danger when our expenses are already unsupportable.\" On June 17 of the next year Richard was admitted to the Phi Beta Kappa Society, an academic organization through which he was able to refine his speaking skills. In December of that year, a British invasion fleet transporting newly minted British General Benedict Arnold and his troops appeared off Jamestown, prepared it seemed, to launch an advance upon Richmond. Phi Beta Kappa undertook to secure its papers against capture, and many of its members joined a hastily formed local militia company to offer at least some resistance to the expected invasion.\n\nRichard Bland Lee may have been a part of this militia, or may have earlier returned to \"Leesylvania\" to \"converse with his father about the future.\" Part of that future had apparently already been decided for him, as his father Henry Lee II had destined a part of his holdings on Cub Run to Richard, who it appears agreed to act on his father's behalf in managing this property sometime in 1780 or 1781. In 1787, he inherited of this holding from his father, land that would comprise the estate he would later name \"Sully\".\n\nRichard served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1784 to 1788, 1796, and again from 1799 to 1806. During his second term in the state legislature he was involved in debates surrounding the ratification of the United States Constitution which he wholeheartedly supported. Following ratification he opposed efforts by Patrick Henry and others to call a second constitutional convention to add a bill of rights, believing the new system should be given a chance to operate before wholesale alterations were made. He also believed that the new congress could be trusted to add the necessary amendments.\n\nIt was also during this term that the election of Virginia's first two United States Senators took place. Lee was a strong supporter of James Madison's candidacy. Ultimately however, Madison was rejected by the Henry led House of Delegates on the assumption that he would not push for addition of a bill of rights. A contention Lee worked hard to counteract. Following this rejection Lee continued to work on Madison's behalf in his congressional race, proposing publication of letters between Madison and other's \"...as would counteract the report industriously circulated in the assembly and consequently in the state that you were opposed to every amendment to the new government, and in every mode...\" Unwilling to risk publication of letters critical of others, Madison rejected this idea, but would nevertheless defeat future President James Monroe in a hard fought contest.\n\nIn both of these debates Lee recognized the power of Patrick Henry's oratory, lamenting the weakness of opposition to him. In a letter from Lee to Madison he complains:\n\nOur Assembly is weak. Mr. [Patrick] Henry is the only orator we have against us and the friends to the new government being all young and inexperienced, form a feeble bond against him.\n\nWhile Henry was ultimately able to get the Virginia legislature to pass the measure urging Congress to call a new constitutional convention, Congress refused to do so, instead passing the first ten amendments to the constitution that make up the Bill of Rights.\n\nIn 1788, having served three years in the Virginia House of Delegates, Richard Bland Lee decided to stand for election to the new federal congress established under the recently ratified constitution. Though political parties had yet to form, ideological schisms were already developing by time of the first federal election. In general, those who were the strongest supporters of the constitution in the form adopted by the constitutional convention, including its provision for a strong executive with power tilted toward the federal government were identified as federalists, and those who were less supportive of a strong federal government, and who believed a bill of rights should have been included with the document prior to ratification, anti-federalists. Lee was identified with the former camp. He had strongly supported ratification of the constitution, opposed efforts to force a second constitutional convention for the purpose of adding a bill of rights, and was a strong supporter of George Washington. His district which included his estate Sully, then part of Loudoun County (now Fairfax County), and included Fairfax County, was the home of both Washington as well as future Anti-Federalist leader, George Mason.\n\nLee eventually became the consensus candidate of the federalists, overcoming competition from like minded men including relative Ludwell Lee, William Fitzhugh, Martin Pickett, as well as two friends - Leven Powell and Dr. David Stuart. Opposing him for the anti-federalists was state Senator John Pope. Though there is little primary material describing the tenor of this first election, what does exist hints at a hard fought and sometimes dirty campaign. John Pope was called \"contemptible\" in a letter from John Murray to Horatio Gates, and William Allason writing to John Woodcock described the contest: \"I understand one makes very free with the other's Reputation &c by wch. I would not be surprised to hear of their having Exchanged a few dry blows.\" Lee eventually outpolled Pope, defeating him nearly 4 to 1 in Fairfax County alone, which included the vote of George Washington.\n\nOn March 3, 1789 Richard Bland Lee began service as the first representative of Northern Virginia in the United States House of Representatives. He served three terms as a Pro-Administration (federalist) member of congress from 1789 to 1795. He was a party to the Compromise of 1790 by which in exchange for support of southern delegates for federal assumption of state Revolutionary War debt, northern delegates voted to move the Federal City to a location in the south. His participation in this compromise, as well as his adherence to federalist principles proved to be his downfall. He narrowly fended off a challenge from his more famous relative Arthur Lee in 1792, and finally lost his seat to Richard Brent in the election of 1794. Following this defeat, Richard was returned to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1795, and again from 1799 to 1806.\n\nFollowing his removal from \"Sully\" to Washington, DC in 1815, Richard, along with John Peter Van Ness and Tench Ringgold, was appointed by longtime friend President James Madison as one of three Commissioners to superintend the reconstruction of the Federal buildings damaged by British troops in the attack on Washington DC on August 24, 1814 during the War of 1812. Following expiration of this commission in 1816 President Madison intended to nominate Lee to the new position of \"Commissioner of Public Buildings\". However, after learning the Senate would not confirm any of the three members of the previous commission because of their perceived ill treatment of Benjamin Latrobe who had been appointed Architect of the Capitol in order to aid in its reconstruction, Richard was instead appointed by President Madison as a commissioner to adjudicate claims arising out of the loss or destruction of property during the War of 1812. Lee occupied this position for two contentious years, during which his decisions came in for harsh criticism by Congress. John Randolph of Virginia accused Lee of \"malfeasance,\" and congress finally appointed a \"Committee of Claims\" to look into the operation of Lee's office. While Lee himself was exonerated of any corruption, the committee noted that many \"claimants had perpetrated an extensive 'system of fraud, forgery, and perhaps perjury.\" With his power severely curtailed, Lee, despondent over his treatment, left his position and for a short time seriously considered moving his family to Kentucky. Realizing his prospects would be limited there, and that his wife opposed the move, he decided to stay in Washington DC. In 1819 he was appointed by President Monroe as a judge of the Orphans' Court of the District of Columbia, a position he held until his death on March 12, 1827.\n\nDuring the 1820s, Lee was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions.\n\nUpon his death in 1787, Henry Lee II bequeathed of his Cub Run estates to be equally divided between his sons Richard Bland and Theodorick. Being the older of the two, Richard was given the more alluvial northern half, on which he already resided, having lived there as manager of the estate since approximately 1781. After his election to Congress, and for most of the next five years, Richard turned day-to-day management of his estate over to his brother Theodorick, who supervised spring planting, fall harvest, collection of rent from tenant farmers, and the construction of the large house Richard had planned for the estate on which construction had begun in 1794. Before he left for Congress in 1789, Richard had chosen a name for his estate, Sully. The exact origin of the name is unknown, though Robert S. Gamble in \"Sully: Biography of a House\" speculates that Sully was named after \"Chateau de Sully\" in the Valley of Loire in France. According to Gamble, \"if he turned to a specific source, it was doubtless the \"Memoires\" of Maximilien de Bethune, Duke of Sully and France's Minister of Finance under Henry IV.\" This work was well known among wealthy Virginians in the late 18th century.\n\nUpon his defeat for reelection to Congress, Richard returned to \"Sully\" and took over primary operation of his estate. Determined to steer clear of the untenable practices characteristic of the tobacco monoculture which predominated in Virginia, Richard, like George Washington whom he idolized, applied modern methods of farming designed to diversify production and to halt depletion of the soil. To the end he switched to growing staple crops - wheat, rye, barley, corn and timothy, fruit trees - apple to produce cider, and peach for the making of peach brandy. He planted clover to help replenish the soil and he \"tried crop rotation and the application of nutrients, especially crushed limestone, to fields where productivity was decreasing.\" During this period he either abandoned or severely limited the growing of tobacco at \"Sully.\" He planted large vegetable gardens and in 1801 Richard built a dairy house constructed with red Seneca stone.\n\nConstruction on the large house was begun in 1794 and completed in 1795. It is a \"Federal\"- or \"Georgian\"-style home of two and a half stories. He erected a -story addition in 1799 coincident with the wedding of Portia Lee who, along with her sister Cornelia Lee had come to live with Richard and Elizabeth Lee under their guardianship. Driven into significant debt trying to aid his brothers Maj. Gen. Henry (\"Light Horse Harry\") Lee and Charles Lee extricate themselves from severe financial difficulties, Richard sold \"Sully\" in 1811 to a cousin, Francis Lightfoot Lee (1782–1858). Richard Bland and Elizabeth Lee initially moved to a home in Alexandria, then to a country home called Strawberry Vale near Scott's Run (current site of Tysons Corner), and finally to the historic Thomas Law House at Sixth and N Streets, Southwest in Washington, DC.\n\n\"Sully\" is located at Chantilly, just off U.S. Route 50, on State Route 28, the southern access road to Dulles International Airport. It is owned and operated as a museum house by the Fairfax County Park Authority.\n\nRichard married Elizabeth Collins (c. 1768–1858) in 1794, at her parent's home in Germantown, PA. Elizabeth was the daughter of Philadelphia Quaker merchant Stephen Collins and Mary Parrish, and the sister of Zaccheus Collins, a prominent botanist. Her lifelong friend was Dolley Payne Todd Madison.\n\nRichard died in Washington, D.C. and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery there in 1827. In 1975 he was reinterred at his home, the \"Sully Plantation\" near Chantilly, Virginia. His home is now open to visitors as a county park. www.fairfaxcounty.gov/parks/sully\n\nRichard Bland Lee was the son of Henry Lee II (1730–1787) of \"Leesylvania\" and, Lucy Grymes (1734–1792).\n\n\nHenry Lee, II, was the third son of Capt. Henry Lee I (1691–1747) of \"Lee Hall\", Westmoreland County, and his wife, Mary Bland (1704–1764).\n\n\nHenry Lee, I, was the son of Col.

Its 54 bells are chromatically arranged from G (1.5 octaves below middle-C) to C (3 octaves above middle-C) for a total of 4.5 octaves. The lowest bell is an F♯ concert pitch, and weighs 13,400 pounds. Each bell is engraved with the year it was cast, the seal of the foundry, the seal of Yale, and the motto \"For God, For Country, and For Yale.\"\n\nHarkness Tower, the Memorial Quadrangle that surrounds it, and the Harkness Memorial Chime were all part of a gift to Yale made by Anna M. Harkness in memory of her son, Charles William Harkness. Its original 10 bells (an instrument with a range of less than two octaves is referred to as a chime - the \"Harkness Memorial Chime\" - rather than a carillon) were cast by the John Taylor Bellfounders of Loughborough, England, in 1921. They were installed in Harkness Tower in 1922 and were first rung by John Taylor on June 9, 1922. The chimes were rung regularly by the university organist, Samuel H. Smith, until 1946 when this duty was assumed by a student, Elliot H. Kone '49. On his graduation in 1949, Kone formed a student organization, the \"Guild of Yale Bellringers,\" to continue with four rings per day.\n\nIn 1966, the instrument was expanded by the installation of an additional 44 bells, made possible by a gift from Florence S. Marcy Crofut and also cast by the John Taylor Bellfounders. The original chime had 10 pitches, which were named in concert pitch (F♯-G-A-B-C-C♯-D-E-F♯-G); the expansion kept the same bell as bourdon, but the notes were renamed to make the bourdon a G (it is common practice to make carillons transposing instruments so that composers can assume a standard range). The new fully chromatic 4.5 octave carillon was named the \"Yale Memorial Carillon\" to avoid showing preference to either the Harkness or the Crofut gift. At this point the Guild renamed itself the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs.\n\nBefore the additional bells arrived, a practice carillon was installed in the tower to allow Guild members to learn the new instrument ahead of time. The practice carillon has a keyboard and pedalboard identical to those of the carillon, but the keys strike small tone bars instead of full-sized bells. The practice carillon allows Guild members to practice at a volume comparable to that of most other instruments instead of at the full volume of the carillon, which can be heard for several blocks. A second practice carillon was installed in April, 2006, adding greater flexibility to practicing schedules.\n\nYale tour guides like to perpetuate the myth that Harkness Tower was once the tallest free-standing stone structure in the world, but needed to be reinforced because an eccentric architect poured acid down the walls to make the tower look older. However, the Washington Monument has been the tallest free-standing stone structure in the United States since it was completed, long before Harkness Tower was built. Furthermore, it was the weight of the additional bells in 1966 that necessitated the reinforcement of the tower with a steel frame structure to carry the additional weight.\n\nThe instrument is currently rung by Guild members twice a day when classes are in session, and in the evening during the summer. From September to May, rings occur at 12:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. During the summer, the Guild hosts a concert series of guest carillonneurs on Friday evenings. Free tours are led by students throughout the year and can be arranged using the Guild's website.\n\nEvery fall semester, all students from Yale College and the Yale Graduate Schools are invited to learn to play the carillon and can audition for a place in the Yale University Guild of Carillonneurs. These students undergo an intensive five-week training program led by experienced members of the guild concluding with an audition. The most skilled students are admitted to the group, and perform regularly on the carillon.\n\n"}
{"id": "44629185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44629185", "title": "Yukos shareholders vs. Russia", "text": "Yukos shareholders vs. Russia\n\nYukos shareholders vs. Russia are several international court and arbitral cases seeking compensation from the government of Russia to the former shareholders of Yukos based on the claim that Russian courts were not acting in good faith in launching tax evasion criminal proceedings against Yukos, which led to the bankruptcy of the company. \n\nThe Yukos Oil Company's former shareholders and management filed a series of claims in courts and before arbitration panels in various countries, seeking compensation for their expropriation. The largest, for over $100 billion, was filed at the international Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2007 and resulted in the arbitrators awarding Yukos majority shareholders over US$50 billion in damages. This decision was appealed by Russia and overturned by the Hague's district court.\n\nObservers note the bad timing of the final rulings on the majority shareholders' claim for Russia amid the Ukrainian crisis. Russia intends to fight these decision of the international courts.\n\nUS and Russian investors, representing about 15 percent and 5 percent of Yukos, respectively, lack the benefit of an investment treaty. The sole remedy of US-based investors in seeking approximately $12 billion in redress is to request the State Department and the Office of the United States Trade Representative to espouse the claim to their Russian counterparts, as it is determined by the Magnitsky Act of 2012; State Department officials have reportedly raised Yukos investors' concerns at deputy prime minister level in the past.\n\nIn 2005, Yukos unsuccessfully asked a US court in Houston to send its multibillion-dollar tax dispute with the Russian authorities to an international arbitration forum. By bringing the case in a US court, Yukos sought to focus international attention on its travails and increase pressure on Russian authorities.\n\nOn April 23, 2004, shortly after the imposition of the tax assessment for the year 2000, the former management of Yukos (OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya YUKOS) submitted an application to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nYukos’ claim in the ECHR argued that the company's rights, protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, were violated in Russian courts, which led to its bankruptcy and liquidation; it also argued that Yukos has been singled out for discriminatory treatment. Yukos officials complained that their rights were breached under several articles of the Convention, specifically:“Under Article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the Convention, the applicant company complains about various defects in the proceedings concerning its tax liability for the year 2000. Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property), taken alone and in conjunction with Articles 1 (obligation to respect human rights), 13 (right to an effective remedy), 14 (prohibition of discrimination) and 18 (limitation on use of restrictions on rights) of the Convention, it complains about the lawfulness and proportionality of the 2000–2003 Tax Assessments and their subsequent enforcement, including the forced sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz. Lastly, the applicant company complains, under Article 7 (no punishment without law) of the Convention, about the lack of proper legal basis, selective and arbitrary prosecution and the imposition of double penalties in the Tax Assessment proceedings for the years 2000–2003.”\n\nFollowing an admissibility assessment that took five years, the court declared the Yukos application admissible on 29 January 2009. The Court declares admissible only less than 5% of all submitted applications.\n\nThe hearing on merits of the Yukos Oil Company v Russia case in the European Court of Human Rights took place on 4 March 2010. Yukos Oil Company was represented by Piers Gardner, Barrister of Monckton Chambers. The Russian side was represented by a team of lawyers, which included Georgy Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and British lawyer Michael Swainston. The claim before the ECHR amounted to US$98 billion – as majority shareholders did in the arbitration case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague – but later reduced the claim. This was the largest claim to be brought in the court's history. The claim was an estimate of what the value of Yukos would have been if its assets had not been stripped away and the company had not been liquidated in 2007. The decision was announced on September 20, 2011.\n\nThe court announced that the Russian state violated the human rights of Yukos by agreeing there had been a violation of Yukos' right to fairness in legal proceedings in relation to a tax re-assessment for 2000. The court also established that there had been a violation of the right to protection of property through enforcement proceedings carried out over tax assessments from 2000 to 2003. The interpretation of the tax liabilities which were applied to Yukos was foreseeable, but the court still noted that the crux of the case was the rapid and inflexible enforcement of those liabilities. Yukos had been effectively paralysed because all of its assets were frozen from the first assessment. The court held that two factors in particular contributed to Yukos' demise and violated Article 1 of Protocol No. 1:\n\n\"\"1. The bailiff's choice of Yukos' principal subsidiary as the first target for auction, without considering the implications for the company's future: this dealt Yukos a 'fatal blow';\"\n\n\"2. The Russian authorities were unyielding and inflexible in response to requests for time to pay and the bailiffs imposed additional fines amounting to €1.15 Bn, which had to be paid before the taxes, but the payment of which was prohibited under the freezing orders.\"\" The court did however note that the tax assessments themselves were not considered disproportionate. It was agreed that there was not enough evidence to suggest that Yukos had been treated differently from other companies and so no violation of Article 14 was found. The court denied an allegation that Russia misused legal procedures to dismantle Yukos despite the court's nine-judge panel finding that Russia violated three articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. Both sides claimed victory over the ruling.\n\nNo monetary amount was awarded after the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found the question of damages as \"not ready for decision\". Both parties subsequently had three months to reach a settlement. The ECHR ruling became final on March 8, 2012 when the ECHR Grand Chamber did not accept the request of the Yukos Oil company to have its application to the court referred to the Grand Chamber.\n\nThe ECHR invited a claim for 'just satisfaction', or compensation, from Yukos, which sought compensation of just under 38 billion euros. These damages were being sought on behalf of all Yukos shareholders. There are around 55,000 named Yukos shareholders, some of which are funds representing a number of shareholders. On July 31, 2014, the ECHR awarded shareholders and their heirs €1.87 billion ($2.6 billion), finding Russia failed to strike a \"fair balance\" in its treatment of Yukos Oil Company. The ECHR also ruled Russia should pay 300,000 euros in costs and expenses, plus any tax. The award fell well short of the €37.98 billion in damages Yukos had asked for. It was also significantly less than the $50 billion in damages that its former majority owners were awarded by a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration earlier that same week. However, it was the largest compensation award made by the court. It was 21 times larger than any previous award by this court.\n\nRussia appealed against the ECHR ruling. In December 2014, however, the court rejected an appeal and decided Russia had six months to work out, together with the Council of Europe, the continent's main human rights and democracy forum, a plan \"for distribution of the award of just satisfaction\". In response, Russian Justice Minister Aleksandr Konovalov commented: \"The judges have made the decision. We are forced to accept it. We believe it is unreasonable, but there’s nothing we can do.\" At the same time he said Russia is not obliged to abide by the decisions of the ECHR, adding that the enforcement of decisions is ‘goodwill’ on the part of a member country of the Council of Europe.\n\nOn June 15, 2015, Russia missed the deadline to submit to the Council of Europe a compensation plan for the distribution of the just satisfaction awarded to Yukos shareholders after the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe issued a final reminder only a few days earlier. That same day, more than 90 deputies of the Russian State Duma sent a request to the country's Constitutional Court to clarify how ECHR writs of executions should be applied in Russia. On July 14, 2015, the court ruled that ECHR judgments did \"not override the pre-eminence of the constitution in the Russian legal system\" and that Russia \"can step back from its obligations\" if that is the only way to avoid violating its constitution; however, the judges also said that they had not yet reviewed the ECHR decision on Yukos since the case had not been filed to the Constitutional Court.\n\nIn 2017, the Constitutional Court of Russia overturned a demand by the European Court of Human Rights for the Russian government to pay €1.9 billion to shareholders of Yukos. In response, the Council of Europe condemned Russia's refusal to abide by the Court's ruling, arguing that the country's non-compliance \"bears far-reaching consequences for human rights protection in Russia and elsewhere in Europe\".\n\nYukos Capital S.a.r.l., a Luxembourg-based company under two Dutch-registered protective foundations – Stichting Administratiekantoor Yukos International and FPH for Stichting Administratiekantoor FPH – that are run by Yukos’s former management, represents all those who held Yukos shares when the company was liquidated in 2007, including about 55,000 minority shareholders, some of which were investment funds. As of 2015, the structures control up to $2 billion in assets, which had been claimed by Rosneft.\n\nIn 2006, Yukos Capital obtained four ICC arbitration awards against Rosneft by a Russian tribunal in Moscow, totalling $245 million; mores specifically, the awards were against Rosneft's predecessor company, Yuganskneftegaz, representing money owed to Yukos Capital under four loan agreements. The ruling was later overturned by the Supreme Court of Arbitration of Russia in 2007, but it gave Yukos Capital a chance to take its case to a Dutch court which also ordered Rosneft to pay up.\n\nIn a decision dated April 28, 2009, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam declared the awards enforceable. Subsequently, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands issued a final ruling in 2010 ordering Rosneft to pay $389.3 million in claims. As a result of the Dutch court decision, in 2010 Rosneft paid Yukos the value of the awards. However, it did not pay the $160 million post-award interest that had accrued since 2006. When Rosneft refused to make the requested payments, Yukos Capital asked the courts in Britain, Ireland and the state of New York to oblige it. That same year, a UK court froze £425 million ($640 million) held in UK bank accounts by Rosneft to enforce the claim. This was the first time that Rosneft was materially affected by its acquisition of Yukos's assets.\n\nIn June 2011, the English Commercial Court decided both issues in favour of Yukos, and Rosneft appealed to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. In 2012, the Court of Appeal rejected Yukos Capital's argument that the Dutch treatment of the Russian judgments binds the English courts in any respect, leaving Rosneft free to defend based on the Russian annulment decisions. In a separate part of the English judgment, the court held that the English Act of state doctrine does not impact certain arguments Yukos Capital seeks to make concerning the Russian annulment decisions. Yukos Capital had claimed interest on arbitration awards that were annulled by the Russian courts but the Amsterdam Court of Appeal nevertheless enforced.\n\nIn 2013, Yukos Capital asked the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to confirm a $421 million arbitration award against Rosneft. In 2014, a New York court ordered Samaraneftegaz, a former Yukos subsidiary now owned by Rosneft, to turn over assets to the US to satisfy a judgment to pay Yukos Capital $186 million and restrained it from transferring assets to either shareholders or affiliates. Samaraneftegaz has been refusing to pay the damages ever since 2007. At the Court of Appeal of Paris in January 2013, Rosneft oil extraction subsidiary OAO Tomskneft successfully challenged enforcement in France of the international arbitral award obtained by Yukos Capital S.a.r.l. in 2007 in New York.\n\nIn April 2015, Yukos Capital and Rosneft settled all outstanding litigation in the Netherlands, England, Russia, the U.S. and other jurisdictions; the settlement involved no monetary or other payments by Rosneft or its subsidiaries. Meanwhile, the amount of money reportedly secured in the agreement exceeded 400 million British pounds ($593 million). According to the agreement, the sides are also obliged not to make any future claims related to the bankruptcy and liquidation of Yukos. Those claims that Yukos Capital had already won in court were unaffected by the agreement.\n\nIn 2005, GML Ltd. (formerly Group Menatep), the former owner of 60 percent of Yukos, filed a lawsuit under the Energy Charter Treaty before a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.\n\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration handled the following cases:\n\nThe Energy Charter Treaty aims to promote international investment and co-operation in the energy industry, and to stimulate foreign direct investment and global trade, in part by reassuring potential international investors that their investment will receive fair treatment. GML drew on two main provisions for its case -\n\nAlthough Russia did not ultimately ratify the full treaty, these clauses were still agreed as legally binding for a number of years, as part of the draft framework. European investments in Russian energy projects that took place before Russia agreed to leave the treaty still fall under the treaty's provision of protecting investments. As a consequence, the three-person tribunal led by Canadian lawyer Yves Fortier ruled in 2009 that it would hear the case and that the Veteran Petroleum Trust, a corporate pension fund covering 30,000 ex-Yukos employees, as well as two companies that own Yukos shares — all represented by GML – could seek payments from the Russian government.\n\nPreviously the main shareholder in Yukos, GML sued Russia for more than $100 billion; the core shareholders' stake was worth an estimated $25 billion at the time Yukos was dismantled, but the litigants asked for a multiple of that amount to reflect Yukos' estimated post-expropriation capitalisation and interest. This made the case the world's largest-ever arbitration case. Russia played a full part in the arbitration, appointing heavyweight law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton to represent it.\n\nOn July 28, 2014, the Permanent Court of Arbitration rendered the decision of the three arbitrators serving in the case – besides Fortier, Judge Stephen Schwebel of the United States (appointed by Russia) and Charles Poncet of Switzerland (appointed by the claimants) – in a roughly 600-page ruling. They ruled for the majority shareholders, awarding them $50 billion against Russia, around half of their claim yet 20 times the previous record for an arbitration ruling. The Russian Federation was also ordered to reimburse the Yukos stakeholders for 75% of their legal fees, $60 million.\n\nThe court found unanimously that an expropriation had taken place, with that Russia having expropriated the Yukos oil company in a series of politically motivated attacks in breach of Article 13(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty. In particular, the panel said Russia “was not driven by motives of tax collection” in auctioning off a core business but “by the desire of the state to acquire Yukos' most valuable asset.” However, the arbitrators docked 25 per cent from the value they attributed to the assets seized.\nThe main beneficiaries of just over $40 billion are Leonid Nevzlin, owner of just over 70 percent of GML, as well as four other ex-Yukos owners – Platon Lebedev, Mikhail Brudno, Vladimir Dubov and Vasily Shakhnovsky – who each have just under 7.5 percent. The shareholders do not include Khodorkovsky, who had signed over his Yukos majority stake to Nevzlin during his trial in 2005, in an effort to fend off the attack on the company, and has renounced any claim. Other key beneficiaries include the Veteran Petroleum, a pension fund for about 30,000 former Yukos employees set up in 2001, which is due to receive another $8.2 billion from Russia.\n\nAccording to the decision, Russia has until January 2015 to pay or face interest on what it owes. The possibility for setting the award aside by courts in the Netherlands is limited to technical issues. If Russia refuses to pay, the claimants may – unlike in previous Yukos-related litigation – pursue Russian sovereign commercial assets by winning court-ordered seizures in the 150 countries that are party to the 1958 New York Convention on enforcing arbitration awards; Russia is a signatory of the convention.\n\nRussia has petitioned the court to set the arbitration award aside on technical grounds and missed a deadline to pay the full sum in January 2015. Its application to set the arbitration award aside is expected to be heard in November 2015.\n\nWhen Russia refused to pay the damages, the shareholders were instead forced to register the award in other state parties to the New York Convention and seek court orders to freeze, and ultimately seize, Russian state assets in compensation:\n\nThe Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said in televised comments that Russian entities affected by the moves were preparing to go to court to force the freezing of the assets of “foreign companies with government involvement” in Russia.\n\nOn 20 April 2016 the District Court of The Hague quashed the decisions of the PCA, ruling that it had no jurisdiction as provisional application of the ECT arbitration clause violated Russian law. The former shareholders plan to appeal; the case could go all the way up to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.\n\nTwo arbitration tribunals in Stockholm in 2010 and 2012 ruled in favor of Yukos investors from the United Kingdom and Spain who demanded compensation under bilateral investment protection treaties. However this decisions were overturned by the Swedish appeal court in 2016.\n\nIn early 2006, RosInvestCo UK Ltd., a former minority shareholder of Yukos Oil Company and affiliate of Elliott Associates, initiated a suit against Russia on the basis of a bilateral investment treaty between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation. RosInvest had purchased its shares at a time when their value had already diminished significantly because of Russia's actions against Yukos, including auctioning off of Yukos' common shares in its principal production facilities. In May 2006, the tribunal was constituted at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and included Karl-Heinz Böckstiegel, Sir Franklin Berman KCMG QC and the Rt Hon Lord Steyn. In 2010, the tribunal decided that the Russian state's measures constituted an unlawful expropriation because their effect was intended to “destroy Yukos and gain control over its assets”, thus marking the first instance where an international court or tribunal ruled on the merits of an expropriation claim filed against Russia by former Yukos investors. The court ruled for the Yukos shareholders and for the recovery of $3.5 million in damages from Russia.\n\nIn March 2007, Spanish minority investors in Yukos Oil Company filed an arbitration proceeding, \"Quasar de Valores SICAV S.A., et al. v. The Russian Federation\", had been filed in March 2007 under the Spain-Russia investment treaty. The tribunal under the auspices of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce consisted of Jan Paulsson (chair) of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer; Toby Landau QC, of Essex Court Chambers; and Judge Charles N. Brower of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal.\n\nIn 2012, the claimants won an arbitration award from Russia. Issuing a unanimous award, the tribunal ruled that Russia used “illegitimate” tax bills to bankrupt and nationalize Yukos. The tribunal awarded the Spanish shareholders $2 million plus interest since November 2007, when the company was liquidated. This put the value of Yukos at the time at $62.1 billion, which would be $83 billion with interest added.\n\nRussia sought a declaratory judgment action asking to declare that the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce tribunal lacked jurisdiction. The challenge was escalated to the Supreme Court of Sweden, which decided in 2012 that it could proceed. In 2014, the Stockholm District Court eventually dismissed Russia’s challenge and also concluded that despite Russia’s objections, the Spanish funds should be awarded costs.\n\nOn 28 January 2016, the Swedish appeal court upheld the Russian appeal, ruling that indeed the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce did not have the jurisdiction to arbitrate the case.\n"}
