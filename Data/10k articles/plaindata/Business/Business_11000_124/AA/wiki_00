{"id": "215202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215202", "title": "64DD", "text": "64DD\n\nThe 64DD is a magnetic disk drive peripheral for the Nintendo 64 game console developed by Nintendo. It was originally announced in 1995, prior to the Nintendo 64's 1996 launch, and after numerous delays was finally released only in Japan on December 1, 1999. The \"64\" references both the Nintendo 64 console and the 64 MB storage capacity of the disks, and \"DD\" is short for \"disk drive\" or \"dynamic drive\".\n\nPlugging into the extension port on the underside of the console, it allows the Nintendo 64 to use proprietary 64 MB magnetic disks for expanded and rewritable data storage, a real-time clock for persistent game world design, and a standard font and audio library for further storage efficiency. Furthermore, the 64DD's software titles and hardware accessories let the user create movies, characters, and animations to be used within various games and shared online. The system could connect to the Internet through a now-defunct dedicated online service called Randnet for e-commerce, online gaming, and media sharing. Calling it \"the first writable bulk data storage device for a modern video game console\", Nintendo designed the 64DD as an enabling technology platform for the development of new genres of games and applications, dozens of which were in development for several years.\n\nOnly ten software titles were released until the unit was discontinued in February 2001. It was a commercial failure, with at least 15,000 total units sold and another 85,000 units unsold. Upon the decline of 64DD's commercial viability, most such software titles were either ultimately delivered on Nintendo 64 cartridges alone, ported to other consoles like the GameCube, or canceled altogether.\n\nIGN summarized the 64DD as \"an appealing creativity package\" \"targeted at a certain type of user\" \"that delivered a well-designed user-driven experience\"—and a \"limited online experiment at the same time\", which partially fulfilled Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi's \"longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation\".\n\nWith the 1993 announcement of its new Project Reality console, Nintendo explored options for data storage. A Nintendo spokesperson said in 1993 that \"it could be a cartridge system, a CD system, or both, or something not ever used before.\" In 1994, Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America said, \"Right now, cartridges offer faster access time and more speed of movement and characters than CDs. So, we'll introduce our new hardware with cartridges. But eventually, these problems with CDs will be overcome. When that happens, you'll see Nintendo using CD as the software storage medium for our 64-bit system.\"\n\nIn consideration of the 64DD's actual launch price equivalent of about , Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick warned, \"We're very sensitive to the cost of the console. We could get an eight-speed CD-ROM mechanism in the unit, but in the under-$200 console market, it would be hard to pull that off.\" Describing the final choice of proprietary floppy disks instead of CD-ROM, Nintendo game designer Shigesato Itoi explained, \"CD holds a lot of data, DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up, and [cartridge] ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest. By attaching a DD to the game console, we can drastically increase the number of possible genres.\"\n\nThe company also explored the forging of an early online strategy with Netscape, whose founding management had recently come directly from SGI, the company which had designed the core Nintendo 64 hardware. Within its budding online strategy, Nintendo reportedly considered multiplayer online gaming to be of the highest priority, even above that of web browsing. Several third party game developers were developing prominent online gaming features based on 64DD, including Ocean's \"Mission: Impossible\" deathmatches and Seta's four-player war simulation. Nintendo would ultimately retain the core impetus of these ideas, but would drastically alter both plans over the following years, in favor of a floppy-based storage technology and the Randnet online software and service partner—although with no online multiplayer gaming support whatsoever.\n\nThe 64DD was first announced at Nintendo's 1995 Shoshinkai trade show, at which time Nintendo said it would launch by the end of 1996, although giving virtually no technical specifications yet.\n\nHowever, its first public appearance wasn't until Nintendo's 8th Shoshinkai show of November 22—24, 1996, where IGN reported that the device nicknamed \"Bulky Drive\" was one of the biggest items of the show. There, Nintendo of America Chairman Howard Lincoln stated that the device had received its finalized hardware specifications and sported its own show booth. Nintendo's Director of Corporate Communications, Perrin Kaplan, made the company's first official launch window announcement for the peripheral, scheduled for late 1997 in Japan.\n\nReportedly several developers attended the show to learn how to develop for 64DD, some having traveled from the US for the 64DD presentation and some having received 64DD development kits. The demonstration included an improvised disk conversion of the familiar \"Super Mario 64\" game to demonstrate the drive's operation and performance, and a graphics application mapping the audience's photographical portraits onto live 3D animated avatars—a feature which was ultimately incorporated and released in 2000 as \"\" and the Capture Cassette. Included along with Enix in the early roster of committed 64DD developers, Rare officially discounted any rumors of the peripheral's impending pre-release cancellation.\n\nThe event featured \"Creator\", a music and animation game by Software Creations, the same UK company that had made \"Sound Tool\" for the Nintendo Ultra 64 development kit. They touted the game's ability to be integrated into other games, allowing a player to replace any such game's textures and possibly create new levels and characters. There was no playable version of \"Creator\" available at this show, but the project was later absorbed into \"\". Nintendo also announced their plans to bundle the 64DD with a RAM expansion cartridge at the show.\n\nMuch of the gaming press said the Shoshinkai show did not make as significant a 64DD reveal as Nintendo had promised, leaving the public still in the dark as far as the system's software lineup, practical capabilities, and release date. \"Zelda 64\" (eventually released as the cartridge game \"\") was seen as the 64DD's potential killer app in the months following the system's unveiling.\n\nOn April 3–4, 1997, Nintendo of America hosted a Developer's Conference in Seattle, Washington where a surprise overview was delivered by Nintendo Developer Support staff Mark DeLoura about the 64DD.\n\nThe 64DD is notable in part for its multi-year period of many repeated launch delays, which created an interdependent cascade of delays and complications of many other business processes and product launches for Nintendo and its partners.\n\nOn May 30, 1997, Nintendo issued a press conference announcing the first in what would become a series of the product's launch delays, saying it had been rescheduled to March 1998, with no comment on an American release schedule. At that time, the delays were reportedly attributed to the protracted development of both the disks and the drive technologies. On June 9, 1997, Nintendo and Alps Electric announced their manufacturing partnership for the still tentatively titled 64DD.\nAt the pre-E3 press conference on June 18, 1997, the company lacked even a prototype unit to display while Howard Lincoln stated that the company wouldn't release the device until sufficient numbers of software titles support it. Reportedly featuring at least twenty game titles in development including \"Donkey Kong 64\", the device still retained its projected Japanese launch window of March 1998, and received its first American launch window of early 1998. Also at the show, Nintendo's main game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, speculated that the first games to be released for the new system would be \"SimCity 64\", \"Mario Artist\", \"Pocket Monsters\", and \"Mother 3\".\nIn a December 1997 interview with Shigeru Miyamoto and Shigesato Itoi, Miyamoto confessed the inherent difficulty in repeatedly attempting to describe and justify the long-promised potential of the mysterious peripheral to a curious public. He said that it \"would have been easier to understand if the DD was already included when the N64 first came out. It’s getting harder to explain after the fact. (laughs)\" To illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, Itoi said, \"I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn’t have been allowed to come up with if we didn’t have the 64DD.\" Miyamoto concluded, \"Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we’ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we’ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game.\" By 1998, IGN optimistically expected all major Nintendo 64 cartridge titles to have software support for an impending expansion disk. Known third-party 64DD developers included Konami, Culture Brain, Seta, Japan System Supply, Titus, Infogrames, Rare, Paradigm Entertainment, Ocean, and Factor 5.\nMore delays were subsequently announced. The American launch was delayed to late 1998. The Japanese launch was delayed to June 1998, later adjusted by the apologetic announcement on April 3, 1998, that it would launch \"within the year\". The 64DD was notably absent from E3 1998, having been briefly described the day prior as \"definitely not\" launching in 1998 and \"questionable\" in 1999, which \"Next Generation\" magazine interpreted as being \"as close to 'dead' as we can imagine\". IGN pessimistically explained that the peripheral's launch delays were so significant, and Nintendo's software library was so dependent upon the 64DD, that this lack of launchable software titles also caused Nintendo to entirely skip its annual Space World trade show in 1998.\n\nOn April 8, 1999, IGN announced Nintendo's latest delayed 64DD launch date as being June 1999. Demonstrated at the May 1999 E3 as what IGN called an \"almost forgotten visitor\", there were no longer any plans for release outside Japan.\n\nBy May 1999, the 64DD's launch was still withheld by the lack of completed launch software.\n\nAs of August 1999's Space World event, Nintendo had set Randnet's launch date at December 1, 1999, but reportedly had not yet set a launch date for the 64DD.\n\nThe 64DD was launched on December 1, 1999, in Japan, as a package called the Randnet Starter Kit which includes six games bimonthly through the mail, and a year of Internet service.\n\nAnticipating that its long-planned peripheral would become a commercial failure, Nintendo initially sold the Randnet Starter Kit via mail order. Later, very limited quantities of the standalone 64DD and games were made available through stores.\n\nThe discontinuation of the 64DD and Randnet was announced in October 2000, at a time when there were reportedly 15,000 subscribers. The hardware and online platforms were both discontinued in February 2001. Only nine official disks, including three third-party games and one Internet application suite, were released for it. Most planned 64DD games were either released as cartridge-based Nintendo 64 games as cartridge storage sizes had increased, ported to other consoles such as Nintendo's next-generation GameCube console, or canceled entirely.\n\nNintendo designed the 64DD as an enabling technology for the development of new genres of games, which was principally accomplished by its three main design features: its dual storage strategy of cartridges and disks; its new real-time clock (RTC); and its Internet connectivity. The dual storage strategy of the Nintendo 64 plus the 64DD combines the traditional high speed cartridges, which are low-capacity, non-writable, and expensive but very fast along with the introduction of proprietary mass storage disks, which are large-capacity, rewritable, and cheap but only moderately fast.\n\nThough incompatible in every way with any other consumer electronics product, the 64DD's magnetic storage technology resembles the generic floppy disk, and the large and sturdy shell of the proprietary Zip disk for personal computers. Though various prominent sources have mistakenly referred to the medium as being magneto-optical technology, Nintendo's own developer documentation refers to it in detail as being magnetic. Complementing their proprietary and copy-protected cartridge strategy, the proprietary 64 MB disk format was Nintendo's faster, more flexible, and copy-protected answer to the commodity Compact Disc format, which is cheaper to produce but is much slower, read-only, and easier to copy on personal computers. The most advanced CD technology delivered by the contemporaneous Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation game consoles can hold at least 650 megabytes (MB) of information with a peak 300 kB/s throughput and more than 200 ms seek speed. This compares to the Nintendo 64's cartridge's 4 to 64 MB size and 5 to 50 MB/s of low latency and instantaneous load times, and the 64DD's 64 MB disk size and 1 MB/s peak throughput with 75 ms average seek latency. The high seek latency and low maximum throughput of a 2x CD-ROM drive contribute to stuttering and to very long loading times throughout a gameplay session in many titles, in addition to a much higher production cost, testing cycle, and potential development time for all the potential extra content.\n\nAs an example of variable storage strategies, Nintendo determined that the development of \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" would be retargeted from 64DD disk format alone, to the much faster cartridge format, for performance reasons.\n\nSimilar in proportion of the historical comparison of Famicom Disk System floppy disks to early Famicom cartridges, this disk format's initial design specifications had been set during a time frame when the initial Nintendo 64 cartridge size was 4 MB as with \"Super Mario 64\", and a 32 MB size eventually became popular over the years. Nonetheless, the 64DD disk format would serve as significant storage size expansion upon its 1999 launch when 32 MB cartridges were the norm and on into future years when only three 64 MB cartridges would ever be released for Nintendo 64. The medium's writability, up to 38 MB per disk, would yield enduring benefits to game genre and social gaming like that of the Famicom Disk System.\n\nMany released Nintendo 64 cartridge games have been programmed to detect the presence of a 64DD drive and the game's corresponding optional expansion disk, most of which were never fully developed or ever released. Without an expansion disk present, such a standalone game carries on. Depending on the game's specific capabilities, these expansions can provide extra levels, minigames, and can store personal and user-generated content. Any Nintendo 64 game which doesn't actively utilize the 64DD drive has potential access to only the few kilobytes of writable storage on the standard issue Nintendo 64 Controller Pak and on some cartridges' internal battery backed storage, for storing only the player's basic progress and preferences.\n\nIn addition to writable storage, the real-time clock enables the existence of persistent game worlds according to a real-world clock and calendar, backed by a battery even when the system's main power is shut off. Nintendo's lead game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, said this of the four-year development of the ultimately unreleased pet breeding game \"Cabbage\": \"We're doing it on the 64DD because I wanted to make a clock function, such that even if the power is cut, can still raise the creature.\"\n\nA modem cartridge is packaged with the system, allowing Internet connectivity through Randnet, in addition to the service's members-only portal sites.\n\nThe 64DD has a chip containing an enhanced font and audio library for all software to share, further saving the potential available space of mass storage on cartridges and disks. The 64DD has a 32-bit coprocessor to help it read disks and to transfer data to the main console. The main Nintendo 64 deck uses its RCP and NEC VR4300 to process data from the top cartridge slot and the I/O devices. Like nearly all disc-based consoles, the 64DD can boot up without a cartridge on the top deck, because it has a boot menu. The 64DD is packaged with the 4 MB RAM Expansion Pak, yielding a total of 8 MB. The 64DD has its own software development kit that works in conjunction with the Nintendo 64 development kit.\n\nThe 64DD Randnet bundle includes a modem for connecting to the Randnet network and the 4MB RAM Expansion Pak. Other accessories include a keyboard, a mouse, and an audio-video capture port (female RCA jack, and line in) called the Capture Cassette (or cartridge).\n\nThe CPU-powered software modem cartridge was developed in partnership between Nexus Telocation Systems, Ltd. and Surf Technology. It is housed on a special cartridge with a port for the included modular cable, which then connects to the network. It is the Nintendo 64's only official Internet connectivity product, because the early discussions between Surf and Nintendo to have built one directly into the console did not materialize.\n\nCoincidentally, an unlicensed third party alternative was produced by InterAct for America in the form of the SharkWire Online system.\n\nIn April 1999, Nintendo ended their partnership with St.GIGA which had created the Super Famicom's proprietary Satellaview online service in Japan, broadcasting from April 23, 1995, to June 30, 2000. The company then partnered with Japanese media company Recruit to develop the 64DD's completely new proprietary online service called Randnet (from \"Recruit and Nintendo network\"). The resulting equity-owned joint Japanese corporation was announced on June 30, 1999, as RandnetDD Co., Ltd. Active only ever in Japan, from December 1, 1999 to February 28, 2001, the Randnet service allowed gamers to surf the Internet including a members-only portal, and to share user-generated game data. The subscription fee included the dialup Internet service, 64DD system hardware, and a delivery schedule of game disks by mail. Reportedly, Nintendo and several third party game developers had originally planned multiplayer online gaming as being more important than even a web browser.\n\nThe Randnet Starter Kit comes packaged with the 64DD peripheral and everything needed to have accessed the service.\n\nNintendo had originally promised the following, ultimately undelivered, features:\n\nBeginning on November 11, 1999, membership registration for Randnet opened to a maximum of 100,000 subscribers on a \"first come, first served\" basis. The Randnet service was accessible only via a Nintendo 64 and 64DD setup, and the 64DD hardware was only purchasable by Randnet subscribers — the peripheral was not stocked in any retail stores. The Randnet subscription service came bundled with the 64DD hardware and several games, purchased by filling out a mail order request form at select retail stores in Japan.\n\nThe plan was available in two tiers: a purchase plan for users who want to buy only the 64DD to add to their existing Nintendo 64 system, and a rent-to-own plan for those who want both the 64DD and a special edition translucent black Nintendo 64 console. Randnet was launched with monthly payment plans for the service and hardware bundle: ¥2,500 (approximately ) per month for the purchase plan and ¥3,300 () per month for rent-to-own for the first year and ¥1,500 per month for Randnet service thereafter. The service later eliminated the monthly payment model in favor of an annual prepaid model, at ¥30,000 () for one year for outright purchase and ¥39,600 () for the first year of rent-to-own. The 64DD and some later games eventually became available for purchase directly at retail.\n\nAs part of the subscription, the game disks were delivered not in the initial package but by mail on a schedule: December 1999 had \"Doshin the Giant\" and \"Mario Artist: Paint Studio\"; February 2000 had \"Randnet Disk\", \"SimCity 64\", and \"Mario Artist: Talent Studio\"; and April 2000 had \"F-Zero X Expansion Kit\" and \"Mario Artist: Polygon Studio\". The final Starter Kit subscription title \"Polygon Studio\" was suddenly delayed and then released on August 29, 2000.\nOne of the most substantial series of games to include Randnet support is the \"Mario Artist\" series, which allowed online users to swap their artwork creations with others. Contests and other special events occurred periodically. Papercraft was implemented by way of modelling the characters in \"\" and utilizing \"\" to upload the model data to Randnet's online printing service. The user can then cut, fold, and adhere the resulting colored paper into a full-bodied 3D papercraft figure.\n\nBecause the 64DD hardware package was primarily sold with a mandatory subscription to Randnet, the service was fairly popular amongst the limited 64DD user base. Overall, the service didn't garner enough subscribers to justify its continued existence, and in October 2000, the service's impending closure was announced. \"The 64 Dream\" magazine reported a Nintendo public relations statement, which said that there had been approximately 15,000 Randnet subscribers at the time of this announcement, indicating that there had been at least that many hardware units sold to customers. Nintendo offered to buy back all the Randnet related consumer hardware and to give free service to all users from the announcement of closure, until the day it actually went offline. The Randnet service closed on February 28, 2001 and Nintendo's equity partnership with RandnetDD Co., Ltd. was liquidated from June 30, 2001 to January 31, 2002.\n\nMore than 60 titles were announced for the 64DD that ended up either being released on Nintendo 64 cartridge format only, being totally canceled due to the system's delays or commercial failure, or being ported to another console such as Nintendo GameCube, Sony PlayStation, Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, or Microsoft Xbox.\nRating the overall system at 6.0 out of 10.0, IGN's Peer Schneider finds the industrial design language of the 64DD and its accessories to perfectly match and integrate with that of the Nintendo 64, with no user-accessible moving parts, a single mechanical eject button, sharing the N64's power button, and child-friendly usability. Installation is said to be \"quick and painless\", operation is \"even simpler\", and the whole system \"couldn't be easier to use\". Software load times are described as \"minimal\", where the most complex possible point of the system's library reaches about five seconds. The site says that the 64DD popularity was inherently limited, due in part to its limited release in Japan, a country which had a limited adoption of the Nintendo 64 and of dialup Internet connectivity.\n\nSchneider found the combination of the Randnet's web browser and the mouse to provide a \"passable surfing experience\". He described the portal's private content as \"much too limited\", where \"[a]nyone who has used the Internet would snicker at the lack of up-to-date contents or tools offered on Randnet\". He was disappointed in the companies' failure to have ever delivered certain promised online features, such as game beta testing and music distribution. But it provides new users with a \"simple network [which] functions as first baby steps into the vast world of the Internet\".\n\nSchneider liked the overall product value provided by the Randnet Starter Kit, including hardware, games, accessories, and Internet subscription. However, the platform's abrupt discontinuation proved to limit the appeal to a per item basis rather than as a whole. Because these items were sold only as a soon-discontinued bundle, all with such ultimately limited application, he found the disks' cheaper prices to be aggregated back up to the level of cartridges.\n\nHe found the \"Mario Artist\" series (especially the 64DD's \"killer app\", \"Talent Studio\") to be uniquely compelling in creative ways that \"couldn't be done on any other gaming console on the market\", utilizing the disks' writability and \"[leaving] CD systems behind\". As a flagship title for the platform, IGN found \"Paint Studio\"s well-made art creation functionality to be both a low-cost paint program, and edutainment akin to an Adobe Photoshop for kids. He noted that If the platform hadn't been abruptly canceled, Nintendo supposedly would have utilized \"Paint Studio\" as a source of user-generated art content throughout a notable library of 64DD-compatible games.\n\nSchneider acknowledges Nintendo's vision, attributing the system's downfall generally upon the drastically changing marketplace during the several years of delays until the system's release. He summarized the 64DD as \"an appealing creativity package\" \"targeted at a certain type of user\" \"that delivered a well-designed user-driven experience\"—and a \"limited online experiment at the same time\", which partially fulfilled Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi's \"longtime dream of a network that connects Nintendo consoles all across the nation\".\n\nNintendo reported that there were 15,000 Randnet subscribers as of the October 2000 announcement of the service's impending closure, with at least as many requisite 64DD units having been deployed.\n\nNew genres of games were developed due to the advent of 64DD's rewritable mass storage, real-time clock (RTC), and Internet appliance functionality. However, the system's commercial failure required many 64DD games to be released on traditional Nintendo 64 cartridges alone, ported to other consoles, or canceled.\n\nSome of these standalone Nintendo 64 cartridge releases include the equivalent of the 64DD's RTC chip directly on board the cartridge, as with Japan's \"Animal Forest\". The RAM Expansion Pak became a sometimes mandatory staple of Nintendo 64 game development, being packaged along with a few cartridge games. All subsequent Nintendo consoles would directly include RTC functionality.\n\nThe concept of the popular multiplatform \"Animal Crossing\" series originated with the 64DD's rewritable storage and RTC. The eventual initial release of the series was adapted to utilize only the Nintendo 64 cartridge format with an embedded RTC, in the form of Japan's \"Animal Forest\". That game was cosmetically adapted for GameCube (with the console's built-in RTC and its removable and rewritable memory cards) with the new name of \"Animal Crossing\". All games in the series are played in real time persistent game world, with the passage of time being recorded on writable media. The realtime effect reflects real seasons, real holidays, virtual plant growth, development of virtual relationships, and other events. Interactivity between real human players on different subsequent console generations has been enabled through the swapping of various Nintendo consoles' writable mass storage cards or through online communications.\n\nThe legacy of what is now the \"Nintendogs\" series originated because of 64DD, in the form of a pet creature breeding prototype called \"Cabbage\". Never released, it had been codeveloped by Shigesato Itoi (designer of \"EarthBound\"), Tsunekazu Ishihara (designer of \"Pokémon\"), and Shigeru Miyamoto. Its publicized four-year development was fundamentally enabled by the realtime clock and mass writability, where Miyamoto explained, \"We're doing it on the 64DD because I wanted to make a clock function, such that even if the power is cut, [the game] can still raise the creature\" and with optionally purchasable enhancement data. A subset of creature maintenance functionality is made portable on the Game Boy via the Transfer Pak, to be synchronized back to the 64DD disk. In 2006, Miyamoto concluded that \"the conversations and design techniques that popped up when we were making \"Cabbage\" are, of course, connected to \"Nintendogs\" and other things that we're doing now.\"\n\nThe concept of a personal avatar creator app which had begun with prototypes for the Famicom was solidified in \"\" and then has been seen on all subsequent Nintendo consoles. Those \"Talent Studio\" avatars can be imported into select 64DD titles including the \"SimCity 64\" game. Nintendo designer Yamashita Takayuki credits his work on \"Talent Studio\" as having been foundational to his conception and development of the entire Mii component of the Wii platform a decade later. The game's concepts were reportedly specifically foundational to the characters in \"Wii Tennis\".\n\nThe concept of graphical stamps that are seen in various Miiverse-supported games is found in \"Mario Artist: Paint Studio\" and \"Mario Paint\".\n\nThe user-creation of graphics, animations, levels, and minigames which are seen in the \"Mario Artist\" series and \"F-Zero X Expansion Kit\" are revisited in later console generations. The idea of minigames was popularized generally during the Nintendo 64's fifth generation of video game consoles. Some early minigames can be actually created in \"Mario Artist: Polygon Studio\" in the style that would later be used in the \"WarioWare\" series of games. Certain minigames literally originated there, as explained by Goro Abe of Nintendo R&D1's so-called Wario Ware All-Star Team: \"In \"Polygon Studio\" you could create 3D models and animate them in the game, but there was also a side game included inside. In this game, you would have to play short games that came one after another. This is where the idea for \"Wario Ware\" came from.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "4484012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4484012", "title": "Advertising adstock", "text": "Advertising adstock\n\nAdvertising adstock is a term coined by Simon Broadbent to describe the prolonged or lagged effect of advertising on consumer purchase behavior. It is also known as 'advertising carry-over'. Adstock is an important component of marketing-mix models.\n\nAdstock is a model of how response to advertising builds and decays in consumer markets.\n\nAdvertising tries to expand consumption in two ways; it both reminds and teaches. It reminds in-the-market consumers in order to influence their immediate brand choice and teaches to increase brand awareness and salience, which makes it easier for future advertising to influence brand choice. Adstock is the mathematical manifestation of this behavioral process.\n\nThe adstock theory hinges on the assumption that exposure to television advertising builds awareness in the minds of the consumers, influencing their purchase decision. Each new exposure to advertising builds awareness and this awareness will be higher if there have been recent exposures and lower if there have not been. In the absence of further exposures adstock eventually decays to negligible levels.\n\nMeasuring and determining adstock, especially when developing a marketing-mix model is a key component of determining marketing effectiveness.\n\nThere are two dimensions to advertising adstock:\n\n\nThe underlying theory of adstock is that the exposure to television advertising builds awareness in the consumer markets, resulting in sales. Each new exposure to advertising increases awareness to a new level. The decay effect of adstock eventually reduces awareness to its base level, unless or until this decay is reduced by new exposures. This decay effect can be mathematically modelled and is usually expressed in terms of the ‘half-life’ of the advertising. A ‘two-week half-life’ means that it takes two weeks for the awareness of an advertising to decay to half its present level. Every Ad copy is assumed to have a unique half-life. Some academic studies have suggested half-life range around 7– 12 weeks, while industry practitioners typically report half- lives between 2–5 weeks, with the average for Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Brands at 2.5 weeks. Adstock half-life can be estimated through a distributed lag model response with lags of the TV Gross Ratings Point (GRP) variable, using Least Squares.\n\nSimple Decay-Effect Model:\n\nBelow is a simple formulation of the basic Adstock model:\n\n\"At = Tt +\" λ\"At-1 t\"=1..., n\n\nWhere At is the Adstock at time \"t,\" T\"t\" is the value of the advertising variable at\n\ntime \"t\" and λ is the ‘decay’ or lag weight parameter. Inclusion of the A\"t\"-1 term, this\n\nimparts an infinite lag structure to this model, with the effect of the first Adstock term, approaching 0, as t tends to ∞.\n\nThis is a simple decay model, because it captures only the dynamic effect of advertising, not the diminishing returns effect.\n\nIncreasing the amount of advertising increases the percent of the audience reached by the advertising, hence increases demand, but a linear increase in the advertising exposure doesn’t have a similar linear effect on demand. Typically each incremental amount of advertising causes a progressively lesser effect on demand increase. This is advertising saturation. Saturation only occurs above a threshold level that can be determined by Adstock Analysis.\n\nFor e.g. for the ad copy in the above graph, saturation only kicks in above 110 GRPs per week.\n\nAdstock can be transformed to an appropriate nonlinear form like the logistic or negative exponential distribution, depending upon the type of diminishing returns or ‘saturation’ effect the response function is believed to follow.\n\nThe advertising carryover effect is a famous and debated effect of business marketing practices. Essentially, the carryover theory states that the positive benefits from advertising, especially increased sales, are not perfectly in step with advertising movements but rather delayed and spread out over time so that changes may not be noticeable immediately or measurable right after the advertising strategy has gone into effect. Carryover (measured from the end of a campaign) ranges between 3 weeks and 6 months. This establishes that consumer involvement has a noticeably positive impact on carry-over, as involved consumers have a better memory for commercials. Studies show long and expensive campaigns, result in competitive clutter, when several brands advertise simultaneously, competitive interference depreciates campaign accessibility and makes individuals forget the message more quickly. Observations show noticeable wear-out effects as carry-overs are shortened when brands air multiple campaigns and/or increase the size of their advertising budget.

At his peak in the 1920s he was worth around £12 million in the currency of the time.\n\nThe basis of his wealth was that he invested in electric power and artificial silk businesses when those industries were in their infancy.\n\nLoewenstein was born to Bernard Loewenstein, a German-Jewish banker in Brussels, Belgium. Loewenstein established his own banking concern, and was a wealthy man by 1914. He offered his government in exile 50 million dollars, interest free, to stabilize the currency in return for the right of printing Belgian francs. The offer was refused. At war's end, he maintained a residence in England where he ran an investment business that made him one of Europe's most powerful financiers. He partnered the investment house of Canadian-born Sir James Dunn in several business ventures, the duo emerging with more than £1,000,000 profit from their 1920s investment in British Celanese alone.\n\nLoewenstein was an owner of a successful stable of Thoroughbred steeplechase race horses. His horses won the 1926 and 1928 runnings of the Grand Steeple-Chase de Paris.\n\nLoewenstein also made an enormous fortune providing electric power facilities for developing countries worldwide through his Belgian-based company, \"Société Internationale d'Énergie Hydro-Électrique\" (SIDRO). By the mid-1920s, Loewenstein's reputation was such that he was consulted by heads of state from around the globe. The British government made him a Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath.\n\nIn 1926, he established \"International Holdings and Investments Limited\" that raised huge amounts of capital from wealthy investors wishing to get aboard his bandwagon of success. However, Loewenstein was rebuffed in his attempt to take over a Canadian company called Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power, a huge operation building infrastructure in Brazil.\n\nIt is said that shortly before his death, Lowenstein made a deal with the gangster Arnold Rothstein to supply heroin to the United States.\n\nOn the evening of 4 July 1928, Loewenstein left from Croydon to fly to Brussels on his private aircraft, a Fokker F.VII trimotor, along with six other people. While the aircraft was crossing the English Channel at an altitude of , Loewenstein went to the rear of the plane to use the lavatory. On Loewenstein's Fokker, a door at the rear of the main passenger cabin opened on to a short passage with two doors: the one on the right led to the lavatory, while the one on the left was the aircraft's entrance door.\n\nWhen he had not reappeared after some time, Loewenstein's secretary went in search of him and discovered that the lavatory was empty, and the aircraft's entrance door was open and flapping in the slipstream. The employee (along with the others on the plane) asserted his belief that Loewenstein had fallen through the plane's rear door and plunged several thousand feet to his death in the English Channel. The aircraft landed first on the beach before transferring to the airfield at Saint-Inglevert, Pas-de-Calais, France.\n\nNews of Loewenstein's demise caused panic selling in his corporations' publicly traded shares that immediately plummeted in value by more than fifty percent.\n\nOn 12 July it was reported that tests had been conducted by the Accidents Branch of the British Air Ministry using Loewenstein's aircraft. It was stated that at an altitude of one of the Ministry men had thrown himself against the aircraft's entry door, which had opened about . However, he was immediately thrown back into the aircraft when the slipstream violently slammed shut the door. It was concluded that it would have been impossible for someone to accidentally open the door and fall out.\n\nLoewenstein's body was discovered near Boulogne on 19 July, and was taken to Calais by fishing boat where his identity was confirmed by means of his wristwatch; an autopsy was performed (at the request of his family), his brother-in-law stating that they did not suspect anyone of foul play, but that they did not want anyone to suggest after the burial that Loewenstein might have been poisoned, or had died in the aircraft and then been thrown out. The autopsy revealed a partial fracture of his skull and several broken bones, and it was concluded that he had been alive when he struck the water.\n\nLoewenstein was laid to rest in a cemetery outside Evere, in a tomb belonging to his wife's family, the Misonnes. However, his name was never carved on the slab covering his casket, so he was in effect buried in an unmarked grave.\n\nMany theories have been put forward as to exactly what had happened to Loewenstein in the back of his plane; some suspected a criminal conspiracy in which his employees murdered him. \"The New York Times\" hypothesised that a growing absent mindedness, noted by many of Loewenstein's acquaintances, may have caused him to walk out the wrong door of the plane. Because he had left behind a tangled web of business ventures, many of which were highly leveraged, others theorized that his business empire was on the verge of collapse. Some even asserted that corrupt business practices were about to be exposed and that Loewenstein, therefore, committed suicide. None of these theories was ever proved.\n\nIn 1987, William Norris wrote Loewenstein's story in a book titled \"The Man Who Fell From the Sky\" (New York: Viking, 1987). Norris presents evidence in support of his case that, if his death was not a conspiracy by business rivals and associates, a certain opportunism existed regarding the death of the tycoon and his insurance. He also shows that later events are frequently ignored, such as the fact that Loewenstein's son shot one of the family servants under murky circumstances within a decade or so after the tragedy. The son eventually died in World War II. Norris concluded that Loewenstein had been thrown from the aircraft by Donald Drew, the pilot, at the behest of Madeleine Loewenstein, the motive being to gain control of Loewenstein's fortune. He suggested that the aircraft's rear door was completely removed while in the air and a replacement fitted on the beach at St. Pol.\n\nCrime writers Robert & Carol Bridgestock have speculated that Loewenstein faked his own death and disappeared because the financial irregularities in his businesses. This theory is supported by the facts that the body was buried in an unmarked grave and that his wife did not attend the funeral.\n\nMira Wilkins characterises Loewenstein as an \"[Ivar] Kreuger-type character\".\n\n\n\n"}

Gregorian, (1909 – January 14, 2003), was a Greater Boston oriental rug dealer and author of books on oriental rugs. He is considered by some to be the world's leading collector of rare, inscribed Armenian rugs.\n\nGregorian did not know his birthdate. However, he marked it as November 15, 1909. He was born in Rahvah, on the western shore of Lake Urmia, West Azerbaijan Province, Iran, of Armenian parents, and died on January 14, 2003, in Concord, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1919, Gregorian and his family fled the Armenian Genocide by oxcart on a thousand-mile journey with hundreds of thousands of Armenian refugees from his ancient Armenian homeland near Lake Urmia, over the Zagros Mountains in southwestern Iran, down to Basra, Iraq. There, they stayed at a British refugee camp. Gregorian almost died of cholera and worked as a sidekick to a hakim or herbal doctor to earn food for his family. After traveling by steerage to India, Italy and France, he finally reached Boston and settled in New Britain, Connecticut. In high school, Arthur met Phebe Ballou, his future wife. He spent his final year of high school at the Northfield Mount Hermon School, where in later life he became the director of the board of alumni. After high school he worked in a rug shop to get money to go to night school at Boston University, so he could become a doctor.\n\nIn 1934, Gregorian took his savings of $700.00 and moved to Wellesley, Massachusetts, partly to open his own oriental rug store there and partly to see Phebe who was attending Wellesley College. The store was tiny and below street level, so he visited his potential buyers in their homes or businesses. He and Phebe were married in 1936. The business flourished and in 1940, Arthur was able to move east across the Charles River to larger quarters on Washington Street in Newton Lower Falls.\n\nIn his new store in Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts (), Gregorian finally had the space for his customers to come to him to see his rugs. Business continued to be good until World War II disrupted his importation of rugs as well as reduced the demand for luxury goods. After the war was over, however, the economy of Greater Boston boomed and Arthur's business boomed along with it. He had a store in Newton Lower Falls and another in Chatham, Massachusetts. In 1948 he bought the old Crane Paper Company paper mill next door and expanded his showrooms into it. In 1965 and again in 1989, additions were made to the two buildings, which resulted in of space divided into 10 galleries and over 6,000 rugs on display.\n\nIn 1936, Arthur T. Gregorian married Phebe Ballou (April 14, 1912 – November 19, 1999). They had three children, Lynda, John and Joyce (1946–1991). Phebe was regional president of the Girl Scouts and founding Director of the United Nation's Asian Women's Institute.\n\nArthur and Phebe Gregorian retired to St. Petersburg, Florida in the mid-1970s, but around 1979, Arthur grew tired of retirement and opened an oriental rug store in downtown St. Pete and later exhibited rugs from his collection at local art museums. The Gregorians returned to Massachusetts in 1999. He was a founding member of The Academy of Senior Professionals at Eckerd College.\n\nPerhaps Greogrian's most important legacy has been in his study, writing, filmmaking, collecting and lectures on oriental rugs. Fluent in Armenian, Turkish and Persian, he spent months at a time in the bazaars of Afghanistan, Armenia and Iran buying rugs and filming his bargaining and travels with a 16 mm Bell and Howell movie camera.\n\nIn the study and erudition of oriental rugs, he will be best remembered for his books, \"Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell\", and \"Armenian Rugs of the Gregorian Collection\", done in collaboration with his daughter, Joyce Ballou Gregorian Hampshire and his grandson, Douglas Christian. In \"Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell\", he divided rugs into three major categories: tribal, village, and city rugs. He observed that it is often difficult for a novice to distinguish between a Sarouk, Isfahan or a Tabriz, but it is not difficult for the novice to distinguish between the innate characteristics of a village woven Bidjar and an intricate and highly stylized city woven Qum. \"Oriental Rugs and the Stories They Tell\" was a breakthrough in the study of rugs, because it made the study of rugs clear and accessible.\n\nHis book on Armenian oriental rugs came out of realization that many rugs labeled as Turkish or Kazakh or something else were in fact Armenian in origin. He was extremely proud of his Armenian heritage and spent the last decades of his life collecting and documenting the particular aspects of Armenian oriental rug weaving. His collection of Armenian oriental rugs was shown throughout the world and the majority of it was donated to the Armenian Library and Museum of America, of which he was a founding member and director. He was also president of the Armenian Rugs Society.\n\nHe also wrote a book with his wife, Phebe, entitled \"Armenag's Story\", about his own travels by ox-cart from his Armenian home to a British refugee camp in Basra in present-day Iraq.\n\nGregorian was actively involved in social causes throughout most of his life. He was president of the Newton Rotary Club, as well as a long time active member of the Kabul, Afghanistan Rotary Club. He was the founding chairman of the board of directors for Damavand College, a women's college located north of Tehran.\n\nIn 1953, as President of Morgan Memorial and President of Goodwill Industries, he called his friend and fellow Armenian, Stephen P. Mugar, and asked if he could place a new collection receptacle he had designed in the parking lot of the Star Market in Wellesley Hills. The container was a dumpster painted blue with a rectangular hole cut in the side for shoppers to deposit their extra clothing for the needy. This first Goodwill collection box became such an attraction for grocery shoppers that soon competitors of Star Market were requesting containers of their own.\n\n"}
{"id": "35597124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35597124", "title": "Bayesian inference in marketing", "text": "Bayesian inference in marketing\n\nIn marketing, Bayesian inference allows for decision making and market research evaluation under uncertainty and with limited data.\n\nBayes’ theorem is fundamental to Bayesian inference. It is a subset of statistics, providing a mathematical framework for forming inferences through the concept of probability, in which evidence about the true state of the world is expressed in terms of degrees of belief through subjectively assessed numerical probabilities. Such a probability is known as a Bayesian probability. The fundamental ideas and concepts behind Bayes' theorem, and its use within Bayesian inference, have been developed and added to over the past centuries by Thomas Bayes, Richard Price and Pierre Simon Laplace as well as numerous other mathematicians, statisticians and scientists. Bayesian inference has experienced spikes in popularity as it has been seen as vague and controversial by rival frequentist statisticians. In the past few decades Bayesian inference has become widespread in many scientific and social science fields such as marketing. Bayesian inference allows for decision making and market research evaluation under uncertainty and limited data.\n\nBayesian probability specifies that there is some prior probability. Bayesian statisticians can use both an objective and a subjective approach when interpreting the prior probability, which is then updated in light of new relevant information. The concept is a manipulation of conditional probabilities:\n\nAlternatively, a more simple understanding of the formula may be reached by substituting the events formula_2 and formula_3 to become respectively the hypothesis formula_4 and the data formula_5. The rule allows for a judgment of the relative truth of the hypothesis given the data.\n\nThis is done through the calculation shown below, where formula_6 is the likelihood function. This assesses the probability of the observed data formula_5 arising from the hypothesis formula_4; formula_9 is the assigned prior probability or initial belief about the hypothesis; the denominator formula_10 is formed by the integrating or summing of formula_11; formula_12 is known as the posterior which is the recalculated probability, or updated belief about the hypothesis. It is a result of the prior beliefs as well as sample information. The posterior is a conditional distribution as the result of collecting or in consideration of new relevant data.\n\nformula_13\n\nTo sum up this formula: the posterior probability of the hypothesis is equal to the prior probability of the hypothesis multiplied by the conditional probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, divided by the probability of the new evidence.\n\nWhile the concepts of Bayesian statistics are thought to date back to 1763, marketers' exposure to the concepts are relatively recent, dating from 1959. Subsequently, many books and articles have been written about the application of Bayesian statistics to marketing decision-making and market research. It was predicted that the Bayesian approach would be used widely in the marketing field but up until the mid-1980s the methods were considered impractical. The resurgence in the use of Bayesian methods is largely due to the developments over the last few decades in computational methods; and expanded availability of detailed marketplace data - primarily due to the birth of the world wide web and explosion of the internet.\n\nBayesian decision theory can be applied to all four areas of the marketing mix. Assessments are made by a decision maker on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. Assessments are also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. The decision maker can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action under evaluation. This is done before a final decision is made, but it should be noted that in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, expected profit can be computed, that is a weighted mean of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. The decision maker can then choose the action for which the expected profit is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed quantitatively in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.\n\nThe use of Bayesian decision theory in new product development allows for the use of subjective prior information. Bayes in new product development allows for the comparison of additional review project costs with the value of additional information in order to reduce the costs of uncertainty. The methodology used for this analysis is in the form of decision trees and ‘stop’/‘go’ procedures. If the predicted payoff (the posterior) is acceptable for the organisation the project should go ahead, if not, development should stop. By reviewing the posterior (which then becomes the new prior) on regular intervals throughout the development stage managers are able to make the best possible decision with the information available at hand. Although the review process may delay further development and increase costs, it can help greatly to reduce uncertainty in high risk decisions.\n\nBayesian decision theory can be used in looking at pricing decisions. Field information such as retail and wholesale prices as well as the size of the market and market share are all incorporated into the prior information. Managerial judgement is included in order to evaluate different pricing strategies. This method of evaluating possible pricing strategies does have its limitations as it requires a number of assumptions to be made about the market place in which an organisation operates. As markets are dynamic environments it is often difficult to fully apply Bayesian decision theory to pricing strategies without simplifying the model.\n\nWhen dealing with promotion a marketing manager must account for all the market complexities that are involved in a decision. As it is difficult to account for all aspects of the market, a manager should look to incorporate both experienced judgements from senior executives as well modifying these judgements in light of economically justifiable information gathering. An example of the application of Bayesian decision theory for promotional purposes could be the use of a test sample in order to assess the effectiveness of a promotion prior to a full scale rollout. By combining prior subjective data about the occurrence of possible events with experimental empirical evidence gained through a test market, the resultant data can be used to make decisions under risk.\n\nBayesian decision analysis can also be applied to the channel selection process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a profit or loss aspect. Prior information can include costs, expected profit, training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a normal distribution. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into the model that helps to assess the ramifications of change in distribution method. Identifying and quantifying all of the relevant information for this process can be very time consuming and costly if the analysis delays possible future earnings.\n\nThe Bayesian approach is superior to use in decision making when there is a high level of uncertainty or limited information in which to base decisions on and where expert opinion or historical knowledge is available. Bayes is also useful when explaining the findings in a probability- sense to people who are less familiar and comfortable with comprehending statistics. It is in this sense that Bayesian methods are thought of as having created a bridge between business judgments and statistics for the purpose of decision-making.\n\nThe three principle strengths of Bayes' theorem that have been identified by scholars are that it is prescriptive, complete and coherent. Prescriptive in that it is the theorem that is the simple prescription to the conclusions reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning for the consistent decision maker.\nIt is complete because the solution is often clear and unambiguous, for a given choice of model and prior distribution. It allows for the incorporation of prior information when available to increase the robustness of the solutions, as well as taking into consideration the costs and risks that are associated with choosing alternative decisions.\nLastly Bayes theorem is coherent. It is considered the most appropriate way to update beliefs by welcoming the incorporation of new information, as is seen through the probability distributions (see Savage and De Finetti). This is further complemented by the fact that Bayes inference satisfies the likelihood principle, which states that models or inferences for datasets leading to the same likelihood function should generate the same statistical information.\nBayes methods are more cost effective than the traditional frequentist take on marketing research and subsequent decision making. The probability can be assessed from a degree of belief before and after accounting for evidence, instead of calculating the probabilities of a certain decision by carrying out a large number of trials with each one producing an outcome from a set of possible outcomes. The planning and implementation of trials to see how a decision impacts in the ‘field’ e.g. observing consumers reaction to a relabeling of a product, is time consuming and costly, a method many firms cannot afford. In place of taking the frequentist route in aiming for a universally acceptable conclusion through iteration, it is sometimes more effective to take advantage of all the information available to the firm to work out the ‘best’ decision at the time, and then subsequently when new knowledge is obtained, revise the posterior distribution to be then used as the prior, thus the inferences continue to logically contribute to one another based on Bayes theorem.\n\nIn marketing situations, it is important that the prior probability is (1) chosen correctly, and (2) is understood. A disadvantage to using Bayesian analysis is that there is no ‘correct’ way to choose a prior, therefore the inferences require a thorough analysis to translate the subjective prior beliefs into a mathematically formulated prior to ensure that the results will not be misleading and consequently lead to the disproportionate analysis of preposteriors. The subjective definition of probability and the selection and use of the priors have led to statisticians critiquing this subjective definition of probability that underlies the Bayesian approach.\nBayesian probability is often found to be difficult when analysing and assessing probabilities due to its initial counter intuitive nature. Often when deciding between strategies based on a decision, they are interpreted as: where there is evidence X that shows condition A might hold true, is misread by judging A's likelihood by how well the evidence X matches A, but crucially without considering the prior frequency of A. In alignment with Falsification, which aims to question and falsify instead of prove hypotheses, where there is very strong evidence X, it does not necessarily mean there is a very high probability that A leads to B, but in fact should be interpreted as a very low probability of A not leading to B.\nIn the field of marketing, behavioural experiments which have dealt with managerial decision- making, and risk perception, in consumer decisions have utilised the Bayesian model, or similar models, but found that it may not be relevant quantitatively in predicting human information processing behaviour. Instead the model has been proven as useful as a qualitative means of describing how individuals combine new evidence with their predetermined judgements. Therefore, “the model may have some value as a first approximation to the development of descriptive choice theory” in consumer and managerial instances.\n\nAn advertising manager is deciding whether or not to increase the advertising for a product in a particular market. The Bayes approach to this decision suggests: 1) These alternative courses of action for which the consequences are uncertain are a necessary condition in order to apply Bayes'; 2) The advertising manager will pick the course of action which allows him to achieve some objective i.e. a maximum return on his advertising investment in the form of profit; 3) He must determine the possible consequences of each action into some measure of success (or loss) with which a certain objective is achieved.\n\nThis 3 component example explains how the payoffs are conditional upon which outcomes occur. The advertising manager can characterize the outcomes based on past experience and knowledge and devise some possible events that are more likely to occur than others. He can then assign to these events prior probabilities, which would be in the form of numerical weights.\n\nHe can test out his predictions (prior probabilities) through an experiment. For example, he can run a test campaign to decide if the total level of advertising should be in fact increased. Based on the outcome of the experiment he can re-evaluate his prior probability and make a decision on whether to go ahead with increasing the advertising in the market or not. However gathering this additional data is costly, time consuming and may not lead to perfectly reliable results. As a decision makers he has to deal with experimental and systematic error and this is where Bayes' comes in.\n\nIt approaches the experimental problem by asking; is additional data required? If so, how much needs to be collected and by what means and finally, how does the decision maker revise his prior judgment in light of the results of the new experimental evidence? In this example the advertising manager can use the Bayesian approach to deal with his dilemma and update his prior judgments in light of new information he gains. He needs to take into account the profit (utility) attached to the alternative acts under different events and the value versus cost of information in order to make his optimal decision on how to proceed.\n\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a flexible procedure designed to fit a variety of Bayesian models. It is the underlying method used in computational software such as the LaplacesDemon R Package and WinBUGS. The advancements and developments of these types of statistical software have allowed for the growth of Bayes by offering ease of calculation. This is achieved by the generation of samples from the posterior distributions, which are then used to produce a range of options or strategies which are allocated numerical weights. MCMC obtains these samples and produces summary and diagnostic statistics while also saving the posterior samples in the output. The decision maker can then assess the results from the output data set and choose the best option to proceed.\n\nFor illustrative examples of Bayesian applications in marketing:\n\n"}

{"id": "58721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58721", "title": "Chemical industry", "text": "Chemical industry\n\nThe chemical industry comprises the companies that produce industrial chemicals. Central to the modern world economy, it converts raw materials (oil, natural gas, air, water, metals, and minerals) into more than 70,000 different products.\n\nThe plastics industry contains some overlap, as most chemical companies produce plastic as well as other chemicals.\n\nAlthough chemicals were made and used throughout history, the birth of the heavy chemical industry (production of chemicals in large quantities for a variety of uses) coincided with the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution in general.\n\nOne of the first chemicals to be produced in large amounts through industrial processes was sulphuric acid. In 1736, the pharmacist Joshua Ward developed a process for its production that involved heating saltpeter, allowing the sulfur to oxidize and combine with water. It was the first practical production of sulphuric acid on a large scale. John Roebuck and Samuel Garbett were the first to establish a large-scale factory in Prestonpans, Scotland, in 1749, which used leaden condensing chambers for the manufacture of sulfuric acid.\nIn the early 18th century, cloth was bleached by treating it with stale urine or sour milk and exposing it to sunlight for long periods of time, which created a severe bottleneck in production. Sulfuric acid began to be used as a more efficient agent as well as lime by the middle of the century, but it was the discovery of bleaching powder by Charles Tennant that spurred the creation of the first great chemical industrial enterprise. His powder was made by reacting chlorine with dry slaked lime and proved to be a cheap and successful product. He opened a factory in St Rollox, north of Glasgow, and production went from just 52 tons in 1799 to almost 10,000 tons just five years later.\n\nSoda ash was used since ancient times in the production of glass, textile, soap, and paper, and the source of the potash had traditionally been wood ashes in Western Europe. By the 18th century, this source was becoming uneconomical due to deforestation, and the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize of 2400 livres for a method to produce alkali from sea salt (sodium chloride). The Leblanc process was patented in 1791 by Nicolas Leblanc who then built a Leblanc plant at Saint-Denis. He was denied his prize money because of the French Revolution.\n\nHowever, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process really took off. William Losh built the first soda works in Britain at the Losh, Wilson and Bell works on the River Tyne in 1816, but it remained on a small scale due to large tariffs on salt production until 1824. When these tariffs were repealed, the British soda industry was able to rapidly expand. James Muspratt's chemical works in Liverpool and Charles Tennant's complex near Glasgow became the largest chemical production centres anywhere. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.\nThese huge factories began to produce a greater diversity of chemicals as the Industrial Revolution matured. Originally, large quantities of alkaline waste were vented into the environment from the production of soda, provoking one of the first pieces of environmental legislation to be passed in 1863. This provided for close inspection of the factories and imposed heavy fines on those exceeding the limits on pollution. Methods were soon devised to make useful byproducts from the alkali.\n\nThe Solvay process was developed by the Belgian industrial chemist Ernest Solvay in 1861. In 1864, Solvay and his brother Alfred constructed a plant in the Belgian town of Charleroi and in 1874, they expanded into a larger plant in Nancy, France. The new process proved more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method, and its use spread. In the same year, Ludwig Mond visited Solvay to acquire the rights to use his process, and he and John Brunner formed the firm of Brunner, Mond & Co., and built a Solvay plant at Winnington, England. Mond was instrumental in making the Solvay process a commercial success; he made several refinements between 1873 and 1880 that removed byproducts that could slow or halt the mass production of sodium carbonate through use of the process.\n\nThe late 19th century saw an explosion in both the quantity of production and the variety of chemicals that were manufactured. Large chemical industries also took shape in Germany and later in the United States.\nProduction of artificial manufactured fertilizer for agriculture was pioneered by Sir John Lawes at his purpose-built Rothamsted Research facility. In the 1840s he established large works near London for the manufacture of superphosphate of lime. Processes for the vulcanization of rubber were patented by Charles Goodyear in the United States and Thomas Hancock in England in the 1840s. The first synthetic dye was discovered by William Henry Perkin in London. He partly transformed aniline into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He also developed the first synthetic perfumes. However, it was German industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes. The three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, and by 1913, the German industry produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad. In the United States, Herbert Henry Dow's use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from brine was a commercial success that helped to promote the country's chemical industry.\n\nThe petrochemical industry can be traced back to the oil works of James Young in Scotland and Abraham Pineo Gesner in Canada. The first plastic was invented by Alexander Parkes, an English metallurgist. In 1856, he patented Parkesine, a celluloid based on nitrocellulose treated with a variety of solvents. This material, exhibited at the 1862 London International Exhibition, anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics. The industrial production of soap from vegetable oils was started by William Lever and his brother James in 1885 in Lancashire based on a modern chemical process invented by William Hough Watson that used glycerin and vegetable oils.\n\nBy the 1920s, chemical firms consolidated into large conglomerates; IG Farben in Germany, Rhône-Poulenc in France and Imperial Chemical Industries in Britain. Dupont became a major chemicals firm in the early 20th century in America.\n\nCurrently chemical production is a high-tech industry, where the competitiveness is more based on capacity in investment on research and development than the labour cost.\n\n\"Polymers and plastics, especially polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene and polycarbonate comprise about 80% of the industry’s output worldwide\". These materials are often converted to fluoropolymer tubing products and used by the industry to transport highly corrosive materials. Chemicals are used in a lot of different consumer goods, but they are also used in a lot of different other sectors; including agriculture manufacturing, construction, and service industries. Major industrial customers include rubber and plastic products, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp and paper, and primary metals. Chemicals are nearly a $3 trillion global enterprise, and the EU and U.S. chemical companies are the world's largest producers.\n\nSales of the chemical business can be divided into a few broad categories, including basic chemicals (about 35 to 37 percent of the dollar output), life sciences (30 percent), specialty chemicals (20 to 25 percent) and consumer products (about 10 percent).\n\nPolymers, the largest revenue segment at about 33 percent of the basic chemicals dollar value, includes all categories of plastics and man-made fibers. The major markets for plastics are packaging, followed by home construction, containers, appliances, pipe, transportation, toys, and games. \nThe principal raw materials for polymers are bulk petrochemicals.\n\nChemicals in the bulk petrochemicals and intermediates are primarily made from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, and crude oil. Their sales volume is close to 30 percent of overall basic chemicals. \nTypical large-volume products include ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, xylenes, methanol, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), styrene, butadiene, and ethylene oxide. These basic or commodity chemicals are the starting materials used to manufacture many polymers and other more complex organic chemicals particularly those that are made for use in the specialty chemicals category (see below).\n\nOther derivatives and basic industrials include synthetic rubber, surfactants, dyes and pigments, turpentine, resins, carbon black, explosives, and rubber products and contribute about 20 percent of the basic chemicals' external sales.\n\nInorganic chemicals (about 12 percent of the revenue output) make up the oldest of the chemical categories. Products include salt, chlorine, caustic soda, soda ash, acids (such as nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfuric acid), titanium dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nFertilizers are the smallest category (about 6 percent) and include phosphates, ammonia, and potash chemicals.\n\nLife sciences (about 30 percent of the dollar output of the chemistry business) include differentiated chemical and biological substances, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, animal health products, vitamins, and pesticides. While much smaller in volume than other chemical sectors, their products tend to have very high prices—over ten dollars per pound—growth rates of 1.5 to 6 times GDP, and research and development spending at 15 to 25 percent of sales. Life science products are usually produced with very high specifications and are closely scrutinized by government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration. Pesticides, also called \"crop protection chemicals\", are about 10 percent of this category and include herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides.\n\nSpecialty chemicals are a category of relatively high valued, rapidly growing chemicals with diverse end product markets. Typical growth rates are one to three times GDP with prices over a dollar per pound. They are generally characterized by their innovative aspects. Products are sold for what they can do rather than for what chemicals they contain. Products include electronic chemicals, industrial gases, adhesives and sealants as well as coatings, industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals, and catalysts. In 2012, excluding fine chemicals, the $546 billion global speciality chemical market was 33% Paints, Coating and Surface Treatments, 27% Advanced Polymer, 14% Adhesives and Sealants, 13% additives and 13% pigments and inks.\n\nSpeciality chemicals are sold as effect or performance chemicals. Sometimes they are mixtures of formulations, unlike \"fine chemicals,\" which are almost always single-molecule products.\n\nConsumer products include direct product sale of chemicals such as soaps, detergents, and cosmetics. Typical growth rates are 0.8 to 1.0 times GDP.\n\nConsumers rarely if ever come into contact with basic chemicals but polymers and speciality chemicals are the materials that they will encounter everywhere in their everyday lives, such as in plastics, cleaning materials, cosmetics, paints & coatings, electronic gadgets, automobiles and the materials used to construct their homes. These speciality products are marketed by chemical companies to the downstream manufacturing industries as pesticides, speciality polymers, electronic chemicals, surfactants, construction chemicals, Industrial Cleaners, flavours and fragrances, speciality coatings, printing inks, water-soluble polymers, food additives, paper chemicals, oil field chemicals, plastic adhesives, adhesives and sealants, cosmetic chemicals, water management chemicals, catalysts, textile chemicals. Chemical companies rarely supply these products directly to the consumer.\n\nEvery year, the American Chemistry Council tabulates the U.S. production volume of the top 100 chemicals.In 2000, the aggregate production volume of the top 100 chemicals totalled 502 million tons, up from 397 million tons in 1990. \nInorganic chemicals tend to be the largest volume, though much smaller in dollar revenue terms due to their low prices. The top 11 of the 100 chemicals in 2000 were sulfuric acid (44 million tons), nitrogen (34), ethylene (28), oxygen (27), lime (22), ammonia (17), propylene (16), polyethylene (15), chlorine (13), phosphoric acid (13) and diammonium phosphates (12).\n\nThe largest chemical producers today are global companies with international operations and plants in numerous countries. A list of the top 25 chemical companies by chemical sales in 2015 appears below. (Note: Chemical sales represent only a portion of total sales for some companies.)\n\nTop chemical companies by chemical sales in 2015.\n\nFrom the perspective of chemical engineers, the chemical industry involves the use of chemical processes such as chemical reactions and refining methods to produce a wide variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous materials. Most of these products serve to manufacture other items, although a smaller number go directly to consumers. Solvents, pesticides, lye, washing soda, and portland cement provide a few examples of product used by consumers.\n\nThe industry includes manufacturers of inorganic- and organic-industrial chemicals, ceramic products, petrochemicals, agrochemicals, polymers and rubber (elastomers), oleochemicals (oils, fats, and waxes), explosives, fragrances and flavors. Examples of these products are shown in the Table below.\nAlthough the pharmaceutical industry is often considered a chemical industry , it has many different characteristics that puts it in a separate category. Other closely related industries include petroleum, glass, paint, ink, sealant, adhesive, and food processing manufacturers.\n\nChemical processes such as chemical reactions operate in chemical plants to form new substances in various types of reaction vessels. In many cases the reactions take place in special corrosion-resistant equipment at elevated temperatures and pressures with the use of catalysts. The products of these reactions are separated using a variety of techniques including distillation especially fractional distillation, precipitation, crystallization, adsorption, filtration, sublimation, and drying.\n\nThe processes and product or products are usually tested during and after manufacture by dedicated instruments and on-site quality control laboratories to ensure safe operation and to assure that the product will meet required specifications. More organizations within the industry are implementing chemical compliance software to maintain quality products and manufacturing standards. The products are packaged and delivered by many methods, including pipelines, tank-cars, and tank-trucks (for both solids and liquids), cylinders, drums, bottles, and boxes. Chemical companies often have a research-and-development laboratory for developing and testing products and processes. These facilities may include pilot plants, and such research facilities may be located at a site separate from the production plant(s).\n\nThe scale of chemical manufacturing tends to be organized from largest in volume (petrochemicals and commodity chemicals), to specialty chemicals, and the smallest, fine chemicals.\n\nThe petrochemical and commodity chemical manufacturing units are on the whole single product continuous processing plants. Not all petrochemical or commodity chemical materials are made in one single location, but groups of related materials often are to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale.\n\nThose chemicals made on the largest of scales are made in a few manufacturing locations around the world, for example in Texas and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast of the United States, on Teesside in the Northeast of England in the United Kingdom, and in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The large scale manufacturing locations often have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as power stations, port facilities, road and rail terminals. To demonstrate the clustering and integration mentioned above, some 50% of the United Kingdom's petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster on Teesside.\nSpecialty chemical and fine chemical manufacturing are mostly made in discrete batch processes. These manufacturers are often found in similar locations but in many cases they are to be found in multi sector business parks.\n\nIn the U.S. there are 170 major chemical companies.They operate internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating. The U.S. chemical output is $750 billion a year. The U.S. industry records large trade surpluses and employs more than a million people in the United States alone. The chemical industry is also the second largest consumer of energy in manufacturing and spends over $5 billion annually on pollution abatement.\n\nIn Europe the chemical, plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industrial sectors. Together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies. Since 2000 the chemical sector alone has represented 2/3 of the entire manufacturing trade surplus of the EU.\n\nin 2012 The chemical sector accounted for 12% of the EU manufacturing industry's added value. Europe remains world’s biggest chemical trading region with 43% of the world’s exports and 37%of the world’s imports, although the latest data shows that Asia is catching up with 34% of the exports and 37% of imports. Even so, Europe still has a trading surplus with all regions of the world except Japan and China where in 2011 there was a chemical trade balance. Europe’s trade surplus with the rest of the world today amounts to 41.7 billion Euros.\n\nOver the 20 years between 1991 and 2011 the European Chemical industry saw its sales increase 295 billion Euros to 539 billion Euros a picture of constant growth. Despite this the European industry’s share of the world chemical market has fallen from 36% to 20%. This has resulted from the huge increase production and sales in the emerging markets like India and China. The data suggest that 95% of this impact is from China alone. In 2012 the data from the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC)shows that 5 European countries account for 71% of the EU's chemicals sales. These are Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands.\n\nThe chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years. The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic organic polymers used as plastics, fibres and elastomers. Historically and presently the chemical industry has been concentrated in three areas of the world, Western Europe, North America and Japan (the Triad). The European Community remains the largest producer area followed by the US and Japan.\n\nThe traditional dominance of chemical production by the Triad countries is being challenged by changes in feedstock availability and price, labour cost, energy cost, differential rates of economic growth and environmental pressures. Instrumental in the changing structure of the global chemical industry has been the growth in China, India, Korea, the Middle East, South East Asia, Nigeria, and Brazil.\n\nJust as companies emerge as the main producers of the chemical industry, we can also look on a more global scale to how industrialized countries rank, with regards to the billions of dollars worth of production a country or region could export. Though the business of chemistry is worldwide in scope, the bulk of the world’s $3.7 trillion chemical output is accounted for by only a handful of industrialized nations. The United States alone produced $689 billion, 18.6 percent of the total world chemical output in 2008.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3831912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3831912", "title": "East Side Access", "text": "East Side Access\n\nEast Side Access is a public works project under construction by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in New York City, which will extend the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) from its Main Line in Queens into a new station under Grand Central Terminal on Manhattan's East Side. The new station and tunnels are tentatively scheduled to start service in December 2022.\n\nAn LIRR connection to the East Side of Manhattan was first proposed in 1963. The LIRR line was included in the Program for Action, which was published in 1968 and called for numerous transit improvements in the New York City area. Budgetary constraints prevented the construction of any part of the connection other than the 63rd Street Tunnel under the East River. Plans for the LIRR connection were revived in the late 1990s. After the project received federal funding in 2006, construction commenced in 2007. The tunnels on the Manhattan side were dug from 2007 to 2011, and the connecting tunnels on the Queens side was dug up until 2012. Afterward, work began on other structures related to the line, such as the new Grand Central Terminal, ventilation and ancillary building, communication and utility systems, and the supporting rail infrastructure in Queens.\n\nThe new terminal will contain eight tracks and four platforms in a two-level station below street level. It is being built in conjunction with several other expansion projects across the LIRR, including an additional track on the LIRR's Main Line and a new Sunnyside station in Queens. East Side Access has faced controversy for its multiple delays, high cost, and bloated scope. The estimated budget for construction has risen nearly threefold from the original estimate of $3.5 billion, and the originally planned opening date of 2009 has been delayed by fifteen years. With a cost estimate of $11.1 billion , East Side Access is one of the world's most expensive underground rail-construction projects.\n\nExtending between Sunnyside, Queens, and Grand Central, the East Side Access project is creating an LIRR branch from its Main Line through new track connections in Sunnyside Yard and through the lower level of the existing 63rd Street Tunnel under the East River. A storage yard in Sunnyside is also being built, connecting to the 63rd Street Tunnel via a loop. In Manhattan new tunnels begin at the western end of the 63rd Street Tunnel at Second Avenue, curving south under Park Avenue and entering a new LIRR terminal beneath Grand Central.\n\nOn the Queens side, four tunnels merge into two tracks and enter the lower level of the 63rd Street Tunnel. Three of them (Tunnels A, B/C, and D) will connect to the busy Harold Interlocking within Sunnyside Yard, splitting off the Main Line. A fourth tunnel on a lower level will connect to the Midday Storage Yard. The Midday Storage Yard, located to the northwest of the existing Sunnyside Yard, comprises and will contain 24 storage tracks once completed. Tutor Perini is constructing the $291 million yard just south of the existing Harold Interlocking.\n\nThe new LIRR terminal at Grand Central, located 14 stories below ground, would feature a total of four platforms and eight tracks, plus a new retail and dining concourse with 25 retail spaces. There would be two caverns containing one platform and two tracks on each of two levels; the concourse would be located between the two platform levels. The LIRR terminal would initially be accessed via stairwells, 22 elevators, and 47 escalators connecting to the existing food court at the lower level of Grand Central. The number of elevators in this terminal would exceed the 19 escalators in the remainder of the LIRR system combined. The MTA would build and open additional entrances at 44th, 45th, 47th, and 48th Streets, as well as connect the new station to the existing 47th Street concourse. The escalators would be up to long and descend more than . The escalators and elevators would be one of the few privately operated escalators and elevators in the entire MTA system.\n\nSouth of the station, the four tracks on each level will merge into two storage tracks, with one in each cavern on each level. These storage tracks, which extend under Park Avenue south to 38th Street, will be able to store one , 12-car train. The storage tracks were not part of the original proposal, as they were added in a 2008 modification to the plans for East Side Access. The project also includes the construction of several ventilation plants. One is located at 44th Street, near the Yale Club of New York City, while another is located at 50th Street east of Madison Avenue. Ventilation facilities are also located on Park Avenue at 38th Street and at 55th Street, as well as on 63rd Street at York Avenue and at 2nd Avenue.\n\nPlans call for 24-train-per-hour service to Grand Central during peak morning hours, with an estimated 162,000 passenger trips to and from Grand Central on an average weekday. Bilevel rail cars, such as the LIRR's C3 fleet, would not be able to serve Grand Central because of low height clearances in the 63rd Street Tunnel. The project is likely to increase passenger loads on the already overcrowded IRT Lexington Avenue Line and on surface bus routes on the East Side. At the same time, the project will reduce the load on rush-hour E train service between Pennsylvania Station and Midtown East and 7 train service across the East River.\n\nThe project's estimated cost has increased from $3.5 billion when first proposed to $4.3 billion in 1999, $5.3 billion in 2003, $6.3 billion in 2004, $7.2 billion in 2008, $8.4 billion in 2012, and either $9.7 billion or $10.8 billion in 2014. By 2017, the projected cost was either $12 billion or $10.2 billion, making it the most expensive construction project of its type in the world by either measure. The MTA budgeted a total of $10.178 billion to the project over five 5-year capital programs, up to and including the 2015–2019 capital program. Of these, 27% are federal funds and the other 73% are local funds. , the MTA had spent $7.397 billion of the available funding. , the project was expected to cost $11.1 billion, an increase from a previous estimate of $10.2 billion. Of this, $10.3 billion is funded, which allows construction to continue through 2020. The state legislature must approve an additional $800 million to allow construction to be completed.\n\nThe completion date for the project has also been pushed back multiple times. Once planned to be operational by 2009 at a cost of $4.3 billion, East Side Access was then rescheduled to open in 2017, 2016, 2018, 2019, and September 2023. , the new opening date was tentatively projected to be December 2023 or late 2023. However, , the MTA was looking to start passenger service in December 2022, at an estimated cost of $11.1 billion.\n\nIn 2012, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT)'s Inspector General announced that it wanted an audit done on the project, after the USDOT learned of the fourteen-year delay in the completion date and the more-than-100% cost increase. In 2015, the USDOT's Deputy Principal Assistant Inspector General for Auditing and Evaluation, Joseph W. Come, testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's Subcommittee on Transportation and Public Assets. Come said that several New York City transportation projects also experienced significant delays and cost overruns. This was due to a variety of factors, such as fraud, poor management, and a lack of oversight.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported in 2017 that the project was slated to become the most expensive of its kind in the world. With an estimated cost of $12 billion, or approximately of new tunnel, the East Side Access tunnels were seven times as expensive as comparable railroad tunnels in other countries. Over the years, the projected cost of East Side Access had risen by billions of dollars due to unnecessary expenses. Contractors for the MTA were paid more than those working in other cities, even though that provided no construction benefits. Planning for East Side Access cost upward of $2 billion, and planning for MTA projects in general also made up a more significant part of the cost than in other cities' projects. In addition, politicians and trade unions had forced the MTA to hire more workers than were needed. In 2010, an accountant had found that the project was hiring 200 extra workers, at a cost of $1,000 per worker per day, for no apparent reason. The bidding process for MTA construction contracts also raised costs because, in some cases, only one or two contractors would bid on a project. Similar construction projects in New York City, such as the Second Avenue Subway and 7 Subway Extension, had been more expensive than comparable projects elsewhere for the same reasons, even though other cities' transit systems faced similar, or greater, problems compared to the MTA. Other delays were attributed to the fact that dozens of contracts, some of which conflicted with each other, were bid out separately. Cost increases also occurred due to changing the design while construction was underway; ordering components that were the wrong size; failing to cooperate with other transit agencies in Sunnyside Yard; and making infeasible construction-timeline estimates.\n\nIn September 2018, in an effort to alleviate the high costs and shorten delays, the LIRR hired Arthur R. Troup, who previously worked in high-level positions at Atlanta's and Washington, D.C.'s rapid transit systems, as the new leader for the East Side Access project.\n\nIn February 1963, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) proposed a two-track tunnel for the New York City Subway, which would cross the East River at 76th Street. The location of the tunnel was changed several times thereafter. Also in 1963, a new railroad terminal for the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) was being proposed in eastern Midtown Manhattan. In 1965, the NYCTA finally decided to construct the tunnel at 63rd Street. In April 1966, a third track was added to the plans for the subway tunnel. The track would serve LIRR trains to east Midtown, alleviating train traffic into Penn Station on Manhattan's west side while integrating the LIRR with the subway. A fourth track was added to the plans in August 1966 after it was determined that LIRR trains would be too large to run on subway tracks. This amendment increased the number of LIRR tracks to two, and provided segregated tracks for the LIRR and the subway.\n\nIn February 1968, the NYCTA's parent company, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, released the Program for Action, which proposed numerous improvements to subway, railway, and airport service in the New York metropolitan area. The plan included a new LIRR terminal at a proposed Metropolitan Transportation Center at Third Avenue and 48th Street in East Midtown. It also included connections to Grand Central Terminal, with a new northern entrance leading to the center, and the Second Avenue Subway, among other transit services. The new LIRR line was to branch off from existing lines in Sunnyside, Queens and enter Manhattan using the new two-level 63rd Street Tunnel. The upper level was to be used by the New York City Subway's 63rd Street lines and the lower level was to be used the LIRR. According to renderings of the transportation center, the mezzanine would be placed above four island platforms and eight tracks, which would be split evenly across two levels, similar to the structure under construction at Grand Central. \n\nConstruction on the project began in 1969. Four prefabricated sections of the 63rd Street Tunnel were constructed under the East River, the first of which was delivered in May 1971. That first section was lowered into place on August 29, 1971, and the last section was lowered on March 14, 1972. The double-deck, tunnel under the East River was \"holed through\" on October 10, 1972, with the separate sections of tunnels being connected. The estimated cost of the project was $341 million, and the MTA applied for $227 million in Federal funds.\n\nThe construction of the terminal was opposed by the residents of the Turtle Bay neighborhood, where the terminal was planned to be located, as it would have changed the character of the neighborhood. Turtle Bay residents wanted the terminal moved to Grand Central. They also disliked the proposed traffic congestion the new terminal would bring. The MTA contended that its studies had shown that Third Avenue was the only feasible place to put the terminal, and there would have been too great of a concentration of rail lines at Grand Central. It concluded that having the LIRR going to Grand Central would further strain the Lexington Avenue Line. If it were on Third Avenue, passengers would have been more inclined to use the Second Avenue Subway, which was partially under construction at the time. On April 16, 1973, a Federal directive directed New York State to consider expanding and modernizing Grand Central before building the new terminal under Third Avenue.\n\nPreliminary planning for the Metropolitan Transportation Center had been completed by January 1975. Due to continued opposition to the Transportation Center, a \"Grand Central Alternative\" was published in September 1976. It called for the LIRR to use Grand Central Terminal's lower level instead.\n\nDue to the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, the LIRR project was canceled long before the tunnel was completed. \"The New York Times\" noted that the lower level of the 63rd Street Tunnel was still under construction by 1976, even though \"officials knew that the tunnel would never be used.\" Richard Ravitch, the MTA chairman, said that to stop the work was impossible or so costly as to make it impractical subsequent to the construction of the subway portion.\" The lower level of the 63rd Street Tunnel was completed along with the upper subway level. The western end of the tunnel lay dormant under Second Avenue at 63rd Street for three decades. By the time that construction on the LIRR tunnel level stopped, the tunnel was built for a distance of . The 8,600-foot \"tunnel to nowhere\" was completed \"largely for structural reasons — to support the subway tunnel above.\"\n\nThe 63rd Street subway line and LIRR tunnel were completed as far as 29th Street in Long Island City, Queens, with the subway level of the tunnel opening in 1989. The LIRR tunnel remained unused beneath the subway tracks. In 1994, work began to extend the 63rd Street subway tunnel east to connect to the Queens Boulevard subway line; the LIRR tunnel was also extended east, under 41st Avenue in Queens to the west side of Northern Boulevard in Queens. The subway connector was opened to full-time F train service in December 2001.\n\nBy the turn of the century, plans had resurfaced to bring LIRR service to East Midtown. In 1995, officials began the planning process for such a link. At the time, the MTA was quoted as saying that the LIRR East Side connection would not be completed within the next generation. Two years later, in 1997, U.S. Senator Al D'Amato started petitioning for an allocation of federal money to connect the LIRR to Grand Central. New York Governor George Pataki had previously proposed completing the project, but D'Amato's support, as well as the promise of financial backing, increased the likelihood that construction would actually commence. At the time, if everything went favorably, the LIRR link could open by 2010. By that time, the LIRR was the busiest commuter railroad in the United States, with an average of 269,400 passengers each weekday in 1999. As of 1998, there were almost 1.77 million jobs in Manhattan. An increasing number of these jobs were white-collar \"office\" jobs, with most of these new jobs in East Midtown. Penn Station, located on the West Side, was operating at capacity due to a complex track interlocking and limited capacity in the East River Tunnels.\n\nIn 1999, the MTA proposed a $17 billion five-year capital budget. This budget included a $1.6 billion LIRR connection to Grand Central, as well as several subway extensions. The project's final environmental impact assessment (FEIS) was released in March 2001. The FEIS reviewed two key options for bringing LIRR service to Grand Central. The first option was to connect the tunnels to the existing lower level at Grand Central, while the second option was to build an entirely new station underneath the Metro-North Railroad's existing upper- and lower-level platforms at Grand Central. The MTA ultimately recommended selecting the second option because it was cheaper and less disruptive to Metro-North service. In May 2001, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) gave a favorable \"Record of Decision\", a mark of approval, to East Side Access after reviewing the project's FEIS.\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001, attacks, the MTA announced plans to accelerate the timeline for constructing East Side Access. LIRR president Kenneth J. Bauer stated, \"The incident of September 11 shows the importance of East Side Access to a greater degree. If something happened at the East River tunnel, you wouldn't be able to run trains to Penn Station.\" The MTA and Governor Pataki supported East Side Access and the Second Avenue Subway, both of which involved building new railroad infrastructure on the East Side. In 2002, Congress passed a bill that allocated $132 million for infrastructure projects in New York State, of which $14.7 million was to go toward funding East Side Access. Approval of a final design for East Side Access was granted in 2002, and the first properties for East Side Access were acquired in 2003.\n\nIn 2004, some business owners in Midtown announced their opposition to a proposed 16-story ventilation building at 50th Street east of Madison Avenue. They stated that the building would cause pollution and that it could be vulnerable to terrorist attacks. In particular, Catholic Archbishop Cardinal Edward Egan of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York was concerned about East Side Access's impact on St. Patrick's Cathedral, which faced Fifth Avenue with its back on Madison Avenue north of 50th Street. Despite this, the MTA affirmed its plans for the ventilation tower at that location. After continued opposition from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and other nearby entities, the MTA reduced the size of the building and relocated the structure's cooling towers.\n\nFunding for MTA capital projects such as East Side Access, the Second Avenue Subway, and the 7 Subway Extension were included in the Rebuild and Renew Transportation Bond Act of 2005. As part of this act, the state would take on $2.9 billion in debt to issue bonds to fund these projects. Voters ultimately approved the bond issue by a margin of 55% to 44%. The federal government committed to provide $2.6 billion to help build the project by signing a full funding grant agreement in December 2006. The construction contract for a tunnel in Manhattan westward and southward from the dormant lower level of the 63rd Street Tunnel to the new station beneath Grand Central Terminal was awarded in July 2006. The contract went to Dragados/Judlau, a joint American–Spanish venture whose American headquarters were in College Point, Queens, close to the East Side Access site. The total contract award was $428 million and used two large tunnel boring machines. After Hurricane Sandy flooded the East River Tunnels between Queens and Penn Station in 2012, officials prioritized the construction of East Side Access so that LIRR trains could be diverted to Grand Central, allowing the East River Tunnels to be renovated.\n\nWork on the Manhattan side included building a new 8-track train station with storage tracks extending to 38th Street. North of the station, the tunnels would connect to the 63rd Street Tunnel's lower level. The new station would be housed in two gigantic caverns blasted out of the Manhattan schist rock formation under the station. A three-level structure was being built in each cavern, with one train platform and two tracks each on the top and bottom levels. A passenger concourse was being constructed between each cavern's upper and lower levels. An upper-level concourse, accessed by a series of stairs, elevators, and escalators, would replace ten tracks on the west side of Metro-North's Madison Yard. The cavern structure is located under the Park Avenue Viaduct, which surrounds Grand Central Terminal, while the storage tracks are located under the Park Avenue Tunnel, which is located south of Grand Central Terminal.\n\nThe track connections from the new station to the 63rd Street Tunnel were excavated using tunnel boring machines. The first machine was delivered in May 2007. Dragados/Judlau created a launch chamber for the tunnel boring machines under Second Avenue at 63rd Street in Manhattan using a controlled drill-and-blast method, then assembled and launched each 640-ton machine. The first tunnel boring machine was launched westbound then southbound from the 63rd Street Tunnel in September 2007, and it reached Grand Central Terminal in July 2008. The second machine began boring a parallel tunnel in December 2007 and had completed its tunnel at 37th Street on September 30, 2008. Geocomp Corporation was hired to monitor the boring, using a battery of instruments to record vibration, ground settlement and any tilting or drift suffered by the tunnel boring machines. The instruments include inclinometers, extensometers, seismographs, observation wells, dynamic strain gauges, tilt meters and automated motorized total stations with prismatic targets. The tunnel boring machines bored an average of per day. Cross-connections between the tunnels were created under Park Avenue, between 49th and 51st Streets, by controlled drill-and-blast. The work began in mid-July 2008 and required between six and eight months to complete.\n\nIn April 2008, the MTA awarded Dragados/Judlau another contract. The $506 million contract was for excavating caverns for the three-level platform structures, mezzanine, escalators, passageways, and track crossovers. The MTA gave Gramercy Group Inc. the $38.9 million contract to reconfigure part of Madison Yard in March 2009. In September 2009, the MTA awarded Yonkers Contracting Company a $40.8 million contract to demolish a building at 44th Street and construct a ventilation plant and station entrance at 245 Park Avenue, on the building site. Smaller contracts for electrical installations and structural repairs were also awarded in 2008. In 2010, the New York City Business Integrity Commission found that a subcontractor for the East Side Access project was involved with an organized crime family. The subcontractor, who had been hired to haul away the dirt from the excavation process, was replaced.\n\nIn July 2011, after the tunnel boring machines finished drilling through the Grand Central station box, they were left in place under 38th Street and Park Avenue, as it was more economical than disassembling them in Queens and selling them for scrap, which could have added $9 million to the project's final cost. The next step in construction was to make cast-in-place concrete sections to create the tunnel lining. Each tunnel was in diameter, with an average depth of beneath street level. The project's first fatality occurred in late 2011, when a sandhog died after a tunnel collapsed on him.\n\nIn September 2014, the MTA opened a \"pocket park\" at 48 East 50th Street between Madison and Park Avenues, created along with a $97 million ventilation facility at that location. The pocket park has a capacity of 100 people standing, or 40 people sitting down. The park, containing abundant greenery along a granite backdrop with tables and chairs, was meant to reduce noise pollution from the ventilation facility, which also served as an emergency exit.\n\nOn October 26, 2015, a seating area in Grand Central Terminal’s lower-level dining concourse was closed in order to build structural framework that would allow for the construction of stairways and escalators between the concourse and new LIRR station. This was deemed as a major milestone in the construction of East Side Access by Dr. Michael Horodniceanu, President of MTA Capital Construction. On November 10, 2015, a groundbreaking ceremony was held to celebrate the emergence of into Grand Central Terminal.\n\nOn January 27, 2016, the final major contract for the construction of East Side Access was awarded to Tutor Perini Corporation. The contract was for the construction of four railroad platforms and eight tracks for the new Grand Central Terminal. The first tracks inside the 63rd Street Tunnel were laid in September 2017. The pre-cast platforms inside Grand Central Terminal were completed in May 2018, followed by the completion of the tracks in August 2018. The MTA also started installing escalators between the lower concourse and the platform mezzanine. Beginning in April 2018, the MTA began conducting site tours of the project; it had given 35 tours by September 2018.\n\nPrevious work extending subway service through the upper level of the 63rd Street Tunnel to lines in Queens also extended the lower level to a point west of Northern Boulevard, across from the Sunnyside Yard. Work in Queens included extending the tunnel under Northern Boulevard and boring four tunnels under Sunnyside Yard. This was a particularly delicate and expensive task due to the existence of the elevated BMT Astoria Line and the underground IND Queens Boulevard Line directly above. In addition, the existing tunnel bell mouth west of Northern Boulevard was expanded to serve as the staging area for the Manhattan work, bringing in workers, equipment and supplies and bringing out the muck and debris from excavation. A temporary narrow-gauge railway and a conveyor belt system were constructed behind the tunnel boring machines and through the 63rd Street Tunnels to the Queens bell mouth. Due to its shape, the Queens work site was nicknamed the \"Q-tip\".\n\nPile Foundation Construction Company built an $83 million cut structure, which extends the tracks under Northern Boulevard into the Sunnyside Yard. It created an area that served as both the launch chamber for soft-bore Queens tunnels, connecting the 63rd Street line to the main LIRR branches, and an interlocking and emergency exit and venting facility. The cut was then covered with a deck. In August 2009, Perini Corp. was awarded a $144 million contract to reconfigure the Harold Interlocking, increasing its capacity to accommodate trains bound for Grand Central Terminal and to construct new yard lead tracks to allow trains to enter the storage yards. Smaller contracts for structural work, environmental monitoring, and data measurement were also awarded. Some Amtrak buildings in Sunnyside Yard were demolished to make room for the East Side Access portals in Queens.\n\nIn September 2009, the MTA awarded Granite-Traylor-Frontiere Joint Venture a $659.2 million contract to employ two 500-ton slurry tunnel boring machines to create the tunnels connecting the LIRR Main Line and the Port Washington Branch to the 63rd Street Tunnel under 41st Avenue. The four tunnels, with precast concrete liners, total in length. The contract included a $58 million option to dig three tunnel pits and three emergency shafts, as well as complete an open cut. The two custom-built slurry TBMs, which could dig through several types of earth, were the first such machines to be used in the New York City area.\n\nThe two tunnel boring machines began digging on the Queens side in April 2011. On December 22, 2011, breakthrough was achieved in Tunnel \"A\" of the four Queens tunnel drives from the 63rd Street Tunnel bellmouth. By July 25, 2012, all four Queens tunnel drives were complete. In April 2014, contracts were awarded for the final modifications for the tunnels, as well as for communication systems.\n\nThe scope of the project within Queens also included the construction of two bypass tunnels for Amtrak trains within Harold Interlocking. While eastbound Amtrak trains to New England would be able to go through the interlocking without crossing the paths of East Side Access trains, westbound Amtrak trains to Penn Station would use tracks that intersected East Side Access tracks. East Side Access trains to Grand Central came from the east and would diverge to the northwest while Amtrak trains to Penn Station came from the north and would continue west, so the final environmental impact statement called for a bypass for westbound trains. Around $295 million was allocated for the bypass in 2011, and work on this project started in 2013. However, by October 2015, the tunnels were behind schedule because Amtrak and the MTA could not cooperate on track access schedules. These delays ultimately raised construction costs by almost $1 billion as of April 2018, and in a report that month, the MTA attributed the delays to a lack of cooperation on Amtrak's part. The work at Harold Interlocking also included the installation of a microprocessor-based signal system, replacing the old track circuit-based signal system.\n\nIn July 2018, workers started realigning tracks to make way for the construction of the Queens tunnel portal, which was the final major contract not underway at the time. The realignment of the three westbound Main Line and Port Washington Branch tracks, as well as the construction of a new eastbound Main Line track to replace an existing track, were completed by the end of summer 2018. The last major construction contract, which was for the relocation of tracks in Harold Interlocking to build a tunnel portal structure for Tunnel B/C, was awarded in October 2018.\n\nThe Arch Street Yard and Shop is located in Long Island City, near the Hunterspoint Avenue station. The yard itself has been in use since at least 1910. The Arch Street Facility includes tracks that were built on the right-of-way of the LIRR's former North Shore Branch. Although the branch formerly extended west to what is now the Gantry Plaza State Park on the East River shoreline, the Arch Street Facility's storage tracks only extend as far as 11th Street, several blocks away from the river.\n\nThe LIRR planned a maintenance facility in the yard as part of the East Side Access project. The building was completed in either December 2004 or June 2005. The $80.4 million facility was built using a mix of federal and non-federal funds. The LIRR had built the Arch Street Facility in advance so it could test its then-new M7 cars. When the MTA planned the facility in 2002, it had anticipated that East Side Access would open in 2011 and that the Arch Street Shop could be used to maintain the LIRR fleet. It was thought that the Hillside Facility would not be able to maintain the expanded LIRR fleet on its own. However, after the East Side Access project was repeatedly delayed, the Arch Street Facility was ultimately leased and licensed for other uses.\n\nJust south of the Arch Street Yard, the Montauk Cutoff connected the Main Line to the Montauk Branch until it was decommissioned in 2015. Part of the cutoff was demolished to make room for the Midday Storage Yard as part of East Side Access.\n\nA new LIRR train station in Sunnyside on the west side of Queens Boulevard and Skillman Avenue along the Northeast Corridor (which the LIRR uses to get into Pennsylvania Station) would be built, which woull provide one-stop access for area residents to Midtown Manhattan. The station would have two side platforms and one island platform, all of which would be able to accommodate 12-car trains. In its 2015–2019 capital program, the MTA budgeted $76.5 million for the construction of the station. Construction is scheduled to start in January 2021, and is expected to be completed in December 2022.\n\nThe East Side Access project, along with several readiness improvement projects, would allow rush-hour passenger capacity on the LIRR to be increased by 45%. Prior to the project's completion, the LIRR could carry 300,000 commuters daily. Once East Side Access is completed, the LIRR could run 24 additional twelve-car trains during rush hours, increasing passenger capacity to 435,000 daily commuters.\n\nRelated to the MTA's East Side Access project is its long-planned widening of the two-track LIRR Main Line by adding a third track. Completion of Main Line third track construction was assumed during East Side Access project planning and referenced in the original East Side Access environmental impact statement as necessary to support service level increases caused by adding service to and from Grand Central. The MTA has said that it considers the Main Line third track an \"essential\" project to support East Side Access, and that the Main Line third track will \"complement the East Side Access megaproject, which is doubling the LIRR’s capacity into Manhattan.\"\n\nMain Line third track construction was deferred indefinitely by the MTA in 2008 due to budget constraints. In January 2016, Governor Cuomo and the MTA announced plans to restart construction of the Main Line third track. In December 2017, the LIRR awarded a contract for the project to the consortium 3rd Track Constructors for $1.8 billion. Completion was estimated for 2022, in time for the opening of East Side Access. A groundbreaking ceremony for the third track project was held on September 5, 2018.\n\nFive \"readiness projects\" are also under construction to increase peak-hour capacity across the LIRR system in preparation for expanded peak-hour service after the completion of East Side Access. Together, they are expected to cost $495 million.\n\nThe largest of these projects is at Jamaica station. As part of the Jamaica project, the MTA is constructing a new platform for the Atlantic Branch, as well as re-configuring track layouts and installing high-speed switches. After the project is complete, the Atlantic Branch would function as a high-frequency shuttle service to Atlantic Terminal, and all trains from Long Island would proceed to either Long Island City station, Penn Station, or Grand Central via the Main Line. The first phase of the project, which includes the new platform, is planned to be complete in the fourth quarter of 2019 at a cost of $301.6 million.\n\nThe MTA is also installing storage tracks at two LIRR stations as part of the East Side Access readiness project. One storage track, a siding under construction near Massapequa station on the Babylon Branch, would be used to store trains that originate or terminate at Massapequa, allowing for increased peak-hour service between Massapequa and Penn Station/Grand Central. , it is planned for completion in April 2019. The MTA is also extending Track 2 on the Port Washington Branch, which ends as a pocket track east of Great Neck station, an additional east, making it long enough to store two trainsets. It is also installing a new bridge at Colonial Road, near the station. The construction of the pocket track is scheduled for completion in December 2018 at a total cost of $45.2 million.\n\nFinally, the MTA is planning to expand two yards as part of the project. The Port Washington Yard, adjacent to Port Washington station on the Port Washington Branch, would be expanded to allow for storage of two additional ten-car trains. , construction is scheduled to begin in late 2020 or early 2021 and would cost $500,000. The MTA would also expand the existing rail yard along the Main Line/Ronkonkoma Branch adjacent to Ronkonkoma station. This expansion would increase the number of total tracks in the yard from 12 to 23. The project is budgeted for $128 million. Construction started in July 2017, with completion projected for March 2020.\n\nThe LIRR is also purchasing additional railcars to provide passenger capacity for East Side Access. Up to 160 M9A cars might be built specifically to allow for train capacity increases, and are paid for using federal grant money attached to the East Side Access project.\n\nRedirecting LIRR trains from Penn Station to Grand Central Terminal would free up track and platform space at Penn. This new capacity, as well as track connections resulting from the East Side Access project, would allow Metro-North Railroad trains on the New Haven Line to run to Penn Station via Amtrak's Hell Gate Bridge. Four new local Metro-North stations in the Bronx are planned as part of this project, at Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester, and Hunts Point. The MTA also proposes a second connection from the Metro-North's Hudson Line to Penn Station using Amtrak's West Side Line in Manhattan. The Penn Station Access project would provide direct rides from Connecticut, Westchester County, the Lower Hudson Valley, and the Bronx to West Midtown; ease reverse-commuting from Manhattan and the Bronx to Westchester County, the Lower Hudson Valley, and Connecticut; and provide transportation service to areas of the Bronx without direct subway service.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7363430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7363430", "title": "Electronic authentication", "text": "Electronic authentication\n\nElectronic authentication is the process of establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to an information system. Digital authentication or e-authentication may be used synonymously when referring to the authentication process that confirms or certifies a person's identity and works. \nWhen used in conjunction with an electronic signature, it can provide evidence whether data received has been tampered with after being signed by its original sender. In a time where fraud and identity theft has become rampant, electronic authentication can be a more secure method of verifying that a person is who they say they are when performing transactions online.\n\nThere are various e-authentication methods that can be used to authenticate a user's identify ranging from a password to higher levels of security that utilize multifactor authentication (MFA). Depending on the level of security used, the user might need to prove his or her identity through the use of security tokens, challenge questions or being in possession of a certificate from a third-party certificate authority that attests to their identity.\n\n The American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a generic electronic authentication model that provides a basic framework on how the authentication process is accomplished regardless of jurisdiction or geographic region. According to this model, the enrollment process begins with an individual applying to a Credential Service Provider (CSP). The CSP will need to prove the applicant's identity before proceeding with the transaction. Once the applicant's identity has been confirmed by the CSP, he or she receives the status of \"subscriber\", is given an authenticator, such as a token and a credential, which may be in the form of a username.\n\nThe CSP is responsible for managing the credential along with the subscriber's enrollment data for the life of the credential. The subscriber will be tasked with maintaining the authenticators. An example of this is when a user normally uses a specific computer to do their online banking. If he or she attempts to access their bank account from another computer, the authenticator will not be present. In order to gain access, the subscriber would need to verify their identity to the CSP, which might be in the form of answering a challenge question successfully before being given access.\n\nThe need for authentication has been prevalent throughout history. In ancient times, people would identify each other through eye contact and physical appearance. The Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia attested to the authenticity of their writings by using seals embellished with identifying symbols. As time moved on, the most common way to provide authentication would be the handwritten signature.\n\nThere are three generally accepted factors that are used to establish a digital identity for electronic authentication, including:\nOut of the three factors, the biometric factor is the most convenient and convincing to prove an individual's identity. However, having to rely on this sole factor can be expensive to sustain. Although having their own unique weaknesses, by combining two or more factors allows for reliable authentication. It is always recommended to use multifactor authentication for that reason.\n\nAuthentication systems are often categorized by the number of factors that they incorporate. The three factors often considered as the cornerstone of authentication are:\nSomething you know (for example, a password)\nSomething you have (for example, an ID badge or a cryptographic key)\nSomething you are (for example, a voice print, thumb print or other biometric)\n\nMultifactor authentication is generally more secure than single-factor authentication. But, some multi-factor authentication approaches are still vulnerable to cases like man-in-the-middle attacks and Trojan attacks. Common methods used in authentication systems are summarized below.\n\nTokens generically are something the claimant possesses and controls that may be used to authenticate the claimant's identity. In e-authentication, the claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network. Therefore, a token used for e-authentication is a secret and the token must be protected. The token may, for example, be a cryptographic key, that is protected by encrypting it under a password. An impostor must steal the encrypted key and learn the password to use the token.\n\nPasswords and PINs are categorized as \"something you know\" method. A combination of numbers, symbols, and mixed cases are considered to be stronger than all-letter password. Also, the adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) features during the information transmission process will as well create an encrypted channel for data exchange and to further protect information delivered. Currently, most security attacks target on password-based authentication systems.\n\nThis type of authentication has two parts. One is a public key, the other is a private key. A public key is issued by a Certification Authority and is available to any user or server. A private key is known by the user only.\n\nThe user shares a unique key with an authentication server. When the user sends a randomly generated message (the challenge) encrypted by the secret key to the authentication server, if the message can be matched by the server using its shared secret key, the user is authenticated.\nWhen implemented together with the password authentication, this method also provides a possible solution for two-factor authentication systems.\n\nThe user receives password by reading the message in the cell phone, and types back the password to complete the authentication. Short Message Service (SMS) is very effective when cell phones are commonly adopted. SMS is also suitable against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, since the use of SMS does not involve the Internet.\n\nBiometric authentication is the use of unique physical attributes and body measurements as the intermediate for better identification and access control. Physical characteristics that are often used for authentication include fingerprints, voice recognition, face, recognition, and iris scans because all of these are unique to every individual separately. Traditionally, Biometric Authentication based on token-based identification systems, such as passport, and nowadays becomes one of the most secure identification systems to user protections. A new technological innovation which provides a wide variety of either behavioral or physical characteristics which are defining the proper concept of Biometric Authentication.\n\nDigital identity authentication refers to the combined use of device, behavior, location and other data, including email address, account and credit card information, to authenticate online users in real time.\n\nPaper credentials are documents that attest to the identity or other attributes of an individual or entity called the subject of the credentials. Some common paper credentials include passports, birth certificates, driver's licenses, and employee identity cards. The credentials themselves are authenticated in a variety of ways: traditionally perhaps by a signature or a seal, special papers and inks, high quality engraving, and today by more complex mechanisms, such as holograms, that make the credentials recognizable and difficult to copy or forge. In some cases, simple possession of the credentials is sufficient to establish that the physical holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. More commonly, the credentials contain biometric information such as the subject's description, a picture of the subject or the handwritten signature of the subject that can be used to authenticate that the holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. When these paper credentials are presented in-person, authentication biometrics contained in those credentials can be checked to confirm that the physical holder of the credential is the subject.\n\nElectronic identity credentials bind a name and perhaps other attributes to a token. There are a variety of electronic credential types in use today, and new types of credentials are constantly being created (eID, electronic voter ID card, biometric passports, bank cards, etc.) At a minimum, credentials include identifying information that permits recovery of the records of the registration associated with the credentials and a name that is associated with the subscriber.\n\nIn any authenticated on-line transaction, the verifier is the party that verifies that the claimant has possession and control of the token that verifies his or her identity. A claimant authenticates his or her identity to a verifier by the use of a token and an authentication protocol. This is called Proof of Possession (PoP). Many PoP protocols are designed so that a verifier, with no knowledge of the token before the authentication protocol run, learns nothing about the token from the run. The verifier and CSP may be the same entity, the verifier and relying party may be the same entity or they may all three be separate entities. It is undesirable for verifiers to learn shared secrets unless they are a part of the same entity as the CSP that registered the tokens. Where the verifier and the relying party are separate entities, the verifier must convey the result of the authentication protocol to the relying party. The object created by the verifier to convey this result is called an assertion.\n\nThere are four types of authentication schemes: local authentication, centralized authentication, global centralized authentication, global authentication and web application (portal).\n\nWhen using a local authentication scheme, the application retains the data that pertains to the user's credentials. This information is not usually shared with other applications. The onus is on the user to maintain and remember the types and number of credentials that are associated with the service in which they need to access. This is a high risk scheme because of the possibility that the storage area for passwords might become compromised.\n\nUsing the central authentication scheme allows for each user to use the same credentials to access various services. Each application is different and must be designed with interfaces and the ability to interact with a central system to successfully provide authentication for the user. This allows the user to access important information and be able to access private keys that will allow he or she to electronically sign documents.\n\nUsing a third party through a global centralized authentication scheme allows the user direct access to authentication services. This then allows the user to access the particular services they need.\n\nThe most secure scheme is the global centralized authentication and web application (portal). It is ideal for E-Government use because it allows a wide range of services. It uses a single authentication mechanism involving a minimum of two factors to allow access to required services and the ability to sign documents.\n\nOften, authentication and digital signing are applied in conjunction. In advanced electronic signatures, the signatory has authenticated and uniquely linked to a signature. In the case of a qualified electronic signature as defined in the eIDAS-regulation, the signer's identity is even certified by a qualified trust service provider. This linking of signature and authentication firstly supports the probative value of the signature – commonly referred to as non-repudiation of origin. The protection of the message on the network-level is called non-repudiation of emission. The authenticated sender and the message content are linked to each other. If a 3rd party tries to change the message content, the signature loses validity.\n\nBiometric authentication can be defined by many different procedures and sensors which are being used to produce security. Biometric can be separated into physical or behavioral security. Physical protection is based on identification through fingerprint, face, hand, iris, etc. On the other hand, behavioral safety is succeeded by keystroke, signature, and voice. The main point is that all of these different procedures and mechanism that exist, produce the same homogeneous result, namely the security of the system and users. When thinking of the decoupling of hardware, the hardware is not coded in the same form by digitization which directly makes decoupling more difficult. Because of unlinkability and irreversibility of biometric templates, this technology can secure user authentication.\n\nBiometric authentication has a substantial impact on digital traces. For example when the user decides to use his fingerprint to protect his data on his smartphone, then the system memorizes the input so it will be able to be re-used again. During this procedure and many other similar applications proves that the digital trace is vital and exist on biometric authentication.\n\nAnother characteristic of biometric authentication is that it combines different components such as security tokens with computer systems to protect the user. Another example is the connection between devices, such as camera and computer systems to scan the user’s retina and produce new ways of security. So biometric authentication could be defined by connectivity as long it connects different applications or components and through these users are getting connected and can work under the same roof and especially on a safe environment on the cyber world.\n\nAs new kinds of cybercrime are appearing, the ways of authentication must be able to adapt. This adaptation means that it is always ready for evolution and updating, and so it will be able to protect the users at any time. At first biometric authentication started in the sampler form of user’s access and defining user profiles and policies. Over time the need of biometric authentication became more complex, so cybersecurity organizations started reprogramming their products/technology from simple personal user’s access to allow interoperability of identities across multiple solutions. Through this evolution, business value also rises.\n\nWhen developing electronic systems, there are some industry standards requiring United States agencies to ensure the transactions provide an appropriate level of assurance. Generally, servers adopt the US' Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies (M-04-04) as a guideline, which is published to help federal agencies provide secure electronic services that protect individual privacy. It asks agencies to check whether their transactions require e-authentication, and determine a proper level of assurance.\n\nIt established four levels of assurance:\n\nAssurance Level 1: Little or no confidence in the asserted identity's validity.\nAssurance Level 2: Some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. \nAssurance Level 3: High confidence in the asserted identity's validity. \nAssurance Level 4: Very high confidence in the asserted identity's validity.\n\nThe OMB proposes a five-step process to determine the appropriate assurance level for their applications:\n\nThe required level of authentication assurance are assessed through the factors below:\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance defines technical requirements for each of the four levels of assurance in the following areas:\n\nTriggered by the growth of new cloud solutions and online transactions, person-to-machine and machine-to-machine identities play a significant role in identifying individuals and accessing information. According to the Office of Management and Budget in the U.S, more than $70 million was spent on identity management solutions in both 2013 and 2014.\n\nGovernments use e-authentication systems to offer services and reduce time people traveling to a government office. Services ranging from applying for visas to renewing driver's licenses can all be achieved in a more efficient and flexible way. Infrastructure to support e-authentication is regarded as an important component in successful e-government. Poor coordination and poor technical design might be major barriers to electronic authentication.\n\nIn several countries there has been established nationwide common e-authentication schemes to ease the reuse of digital identities in different electronic services. Other policy initiatives have included the creation of frameworks for electronic authentication, in order to establish common levels of trust and possibly interoperability between different authentication schemes.\n\nE-authentication is a centerpiece of the United States government's effort to expand electronic government, or e-government, as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier to access. The e-authentication service enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) from other web sites that both the user and the government trust.\n\nE-authentication is a government-wide partnership that is supported by the agencies that comprise the Federal CIO Council. The United States General Services Administration (GSA) is the lead agency partner. E-authentication works through an association with a trusted credential issuer, making it necessary for the user to log into the issuer's site to obtain the authentication credentials. Those credentials or e-authentication ID are then transferred the supporting government web site causing authentication.The system was created in response a December 16, 2003 memorandum was issued through the Office of Management and Budget. Memorandum M04-04 Whitehouse. That memorandum updates the guidance issued in the \"Paperwork Elimination Act\" of 1998, 44 U.S.C. § 3504 and implements section 203 of the E-Government Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 36.\n\nNIST provides guidelines for digital authentication standards and does away with most knowledge-based authentication methods. A stricter standard has been drafted on more complicated passwords that at least 8 characters long or passphrases that are at least 64 characters long.\n\nIn Europe, eIDAS provides guidelines to be used for electronic authentication in regards to electronic signatures and certificate services for website authentication. Once confirmed by the issuing Member State, other participating States are required to accept the user's electronic signature as valid for cross border transactions.\n\nUnder eIDAS, electronic identification refers to a material/immaterial unit that contains personal identification data to be used for authentication for an online service. Authentication is referred to as an electronic process that allows for the electronic identification of a natural or legal person. A trust service is an electronic service that is used to create, verify and validate electronic signatures, in addition to creating, verifying and validating certificates for website authentication.\n\nArticle 8 of eIDAS allows for the authentication mechanism that is used by a natural or legal person to use electronic identification methods in confirming their identity to a relying party. Annex IV provides requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication.\nE-authentication is a centerpiece of the Russia government's effort to expand e-government, as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier for the Russian people to access. The e-authentication service enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) they already have from web sites that they and the government trust.\n\nApart from government services, e-authentication is also widely used in other technology and industries. These new applications combine the features of authorizing identities in traditional database and new technology to provide a more secure and diverse use of e-authentication. Some examples are described below.\n\nMobile authentication is the verification of a user's identity through the use a mobile device. It can be treated as an independent field or it can also be applied with other multifactor authentication schemes in the e-authentication field.\n\nFor mobile authentication, there are five levels of application sensitivity from Level 0 to Level 4. Level 0 is for public use over a mobile device and requires no identity authentications, while level 4 has the most multi-procedures to identify users. For either level, mobile authentication is relatively easy to process. Firstly, users send a one-time password (OTP) through offline channels. Then, a server identifies the information and makes adjustment in the database. Since only the user has the access to a PIN code and can send information through their mobile devices, there is a low risk of attacks.\n\nIn the early 1980s, electronic data interchange (EDI) systems was implemented, which was considered as an early representative of E-commerce. But ensuring its security is not a significant issue since the systems are all constructed around closed networks. However, more recently, business-to-consumer transactions have transformed. Remote transacting parties have forced the implementation of E-commerce authentication systems.\n\nGenerally speaking, the approaches adopted in E-commerce authentication are basically the same as e-authentication. The difference is E-commerce authentication is a more narrow field that focuses on the transactions between customers and suppliers. A simple example of E-commerce authentication includes a client communicating with a merchant server via the Internet. The merchant server usually utilizes a web server to accept client requests, a database management system to manage data and a payment gateway to provide online payment services.\n\nTo keep up with the evolution of services in the digital world, there is continued need for security mechanisms. While passwords will continued to be used, it is important to rely on authentication mechanisms, most importantly multifactor authentication. As the usage of e-signatures continues to significantly expand throughout the United States, the EU and throughout the world, there is expectation that regulations such as eIDAS will eventually be amended to reflect changing conditions along with regulations in the United States.\n\n"}

He was also one of the leaders in the Philippine Falange during the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nZóbel was born in Madrid, Spain, on October 9, 1877 to Jacobo Zóbel y Zangroniz and Trinidad de Ayala y Róxas. He had a twin named, Alfonso, who died the age of five. His other siblings were Fernando Antonio, Margarita and Gloria (who died a few months after her birth).\n\nHe studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran. He received a bachelor of arts degree from Real Colegio Alfonso XII in El Escorial, Spain. He pursued postgraduate studies at Liceo de San Luis and the Collège Sainte-Barbe, Paris. He was very much interested in engineering and mining, so he also took courses at the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris, Paris from 1897 to 1901. He also pursued the study of painting in the French capital.\n\nHe married his cousin Consuelo Róxas de Ayala in Manila on October 16, 1901. The couple had three children - Jacobo (father of Enrique J. Zóbel), Alfonso (father of Jaime Zóbel de Ayala) and Mercedes. The union was short-lived after Consuelo succumbed to cholera on September 25, 1907 at the age of 30.\n\nHe was a widower for three years when he met Fermina Montojo de Torrontegui. She was the daughter of the Spanish admiral Patricio Montojo, who led the Spanish fleet against Commodore George Dewey in the Battle of Manila Bay. They were married on November 12, 1911 and had four children - Matilde, Consuelo, Gloria, and Fernando (and namesake of his brother, Fernando Antonio).\n\nHe was a managing partner of Ayala y Compañia from 1901 to 1913 and from 1920 until 1943.\n\nIn 1914, his children from Consuelo - Jacobo, Alfonso and Mercedes - would inherit Hacienda San Pedro de Macati from his aunt (and mother of Consuelo), Carmen Róxas de Ayala. The property was first purchased in 1851 by his great uncle, Jose Bonifacio Róxas, for 52,800 pesos. It was inherited by Róxas' son, Pedro Pablo Róxas (and upon his death in 1912, by his widow, Carmen). In 1929, ownership of the property would be transferred to Ayala y Compañia. The property - which had lain in the family’s hands, undeveloped and undisturbed for several decades - would serve as the basis of his family's future wealth. During the 1930s, portions of the property would be developed, as the company's initial foray into real estate development. In 1937, he offered 42 hectares of the property to be leased for the development of Nielson Field.\n\nOn June 21, 1924, the Ayala distillery (Destileria y Licoreria de Ayala y Compañia, maker of Ginebra San Miguel) was sold by Ayala y Compañia to La Tondeña Inc.\n\nAside from his involvement with the Ayala company, he also established La Porcelanica in 1903 - the first ceramics factory in the Philippines. The following year, he established a glass factory with Eduardo Soriano (father of Andrés Soriano Sr.). He co-founded Filipinas Compañia de Seguros in 1913 and ventured into insurance and finance as vice president of Insular Life Assurance Company, a director of Philippine Guaranty Co. and a director of Banco Español-Filipino.\n\nZóbel inherited the liberal ideas and interests of his father Don Jacobo Zóbel y Zangroniz. Like his father, he was educated in Europe, not only in business and sciences, but also in the arts. He loved the cultivation of the arts and culture. His mansion on Plaza del Carmen and Leon Guerrero Street in Ermita, Manila became the focal point of many tertulias and salon de artistas.\nHe donated his vast collection of books on European literature to the University of the Philippines library.\n\nHe was the first modern Hispanist and founded Premio Zóbel in 1929 in order to preserve and promote the use of the Spanish language, which he believed was the true language of Filipino nationalists. His great obsession was the conservation of the spiritual ties between Spain and the Philippines through the promotion of its language and culture. Premio Zóbel was the fulfillment of his desire that \"No quiero que el español muera en Filipinas\". Today, Premio Zóbel is administered by his grandchildren, Georgina Padilla MacCrohon and Alejandro Padilla (both children of his daughter, Gloria).\n\nTogether with brother Fernando Antonio, he co-founded Casino Español de Manila, a socio-civic club for Hispano-Filipinos. He established the Patronato Escolar Español and the Asociación Pro-Idioma Hispano, both efforts directed at strengthening the role of Spanish in the educational system. He was a founding member of Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española in 1924, which became the correspondent of the prestigious Real Academia de la Lengua Española.\n\nHe dabbled as a Spanish-language publisher when he resuscitated the moribund El Mercantil. He supported the arts and gave scholarships, among them, a young Fernando Amorsolo, who in gratitude would teach his son, Fernando, the rudiments of art.\n\nIn 1930, he helped fund the construction of the Manila Metropolitan Theater, a landmark art deco building designed by Juan Arellano. He became the treasurer of the Metropolitan Theater Company.\n\nIn 1936, he reported the discovery of a horde of Oriental pottery found on his Calatagan, Batangas property to the National Museum director Eduardo Quisumbing and subsequently funded the ensuing excavations.\n\nIn April 1939, he was appointed by General Franco as the acting consul for Spain in the Philippines. The government of Spain, in admiration of his many philanthropic and cultural causes, awarded him La Gran Cruz Isabela la Católica and the Medalla del Mérito Civil.\n\nZóbel died on February 17, 1943 in Manila, at the height of the Japanese Occupation during World War II.\n"}

Monkey model was the unofficial designation given by the Soviet Military to such variants. The monkey model was exported with the same or a similar designation as the original Soviet design but in fact it lacked many of the advanced or expensive features of the original.\n\nMonkey-model weaponry was used mainly by non-communist Soviet allies, such as Egypt, Iraq and Syria. Eastern Bloc states generally used fully capable versions of Soviet weaponry, although poorer states often used earlier generations of weapons.\n\nThe term \"monkey model\" was popularized in the West by Viktor Suvorov, in \"Inside the Soviet Army\". Suvorov states that the simplified monkey model was designed for massive production in wartime, to replace front-line stocks if a war should last for several weeks. In peacetime, Soviet industry gained experience building both standard and export-model variants, the latter being for sale \"to the 'brothers' and 'friends' of the USSR as the very latest equipment available.\" He also cites the benefit of disinformation when an exported monkey model fell into the hands of Western intelligence, who \"naturally gained a completely false impression of the true combat capabilities of the BMP-1 and of Soviet tanks\" .\n\nMonkey-model tanks were equipped with downgraded fire control systems, downgraded armor, no NBC system, and provided with substandard ammunition. (Their ballistic computers, range finders, and night vision were inferior to those found on production models)\n\nFor instance, the 3BM17 APFSDS 125 mm smoothbore ammunition were designed specifically for export, and had a penetration of sloped armor at 2000 m that was inferior to the original Soviet model, the 3BM15. By the time of the Gulf War, both rounds were obsolescent and relegated solely to training purposes (not actual combat). For 3rd world client states, however, they were the most advanced 125mm KE rounds available.\n\nMonkey-model aircraft were downgraded in a manner similar to that of tanks. The MiG-23 MS 'Flogger-E', for example, was an export variant the original MiG 23 developed because the MiG 23 was considered too advanced to be exported to Third World countries. The 'Flogger-E' lacked the most advanced features of the original. Infra-red search and track and beyond visual range missile capabilities were removed and its avionics suite was very basic. This variant was widely sold during the 1970s to Soviet allies in the Middle East.\n\nThe fact that most Soviet-designed tanks and aircraft engaged by western forces during the last decades were actually monkey models must be kept in mind when trying to assess the capabilities of real Soviet-era equipment versus those of contemporary western designs. A good example of this is the dismal performance of Iraqi T-72 models during the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.\n\nIn each conflict, Iraqi T-72s failed to destroy a single M1 abrams tank, even after scoring direct hits. On the other hand, a publication from the early 80s claims that the 125 mm 2A46 gun \"will penetrate the armor of any current or future NATO tank at ranges greater than 2,000 meters.\" A decade later, Robert H. Scales insisted that the 125mm gun \"could penetrate the Abrams (frontal armor) at 1,000 meters,\" provided it was using modern ammunition. The performance discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the Iraqi's used substandard ammunition for their guns, while operating a mix of monkey models and their own locally produced variant, the Lion of Babylon.\n\n\n"}

He graduated in 1999, as a watch keeping officer with a BSc degree in marine navigation.\n\nSoon after he started his maritime career on board various types of GNMTC vessels on various ranks, he obtained successfully the combined chief officer and Master Mariner qualification from the Arab Maritime Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport in Alexandria in 2003.\n\nGaddafi was the first consultant to the Management Committee of the General National Maritime Transport Company (GNMTC) of Libya. He was appointed to this position in 2007, upon earning his MBA degree in Shipping Economics and Logistics from Copenhagen Business School.\n\nGaddafi is married to Aline Skaf, a Lebanese Christian former lingerie model, with whom he has three children. Another child, Carthage Hannibal (b. 2 August 2008), was killed in the bombing raid of the family compound on 30 April 2011\n\nIn 2008, Swiss authorities arrested Gaddafi and his wife, Aline Skaf, on charges of \"bodily harm, threatening behaviour and coercion,\" after an incident involving two of their staff at the Gaddafis' hotel in Geneva. The charges were later dropped, but relations between Libya and Switzerland soured. In 2009, two Swiss citizens, Max Goeldi and Rachid Hamdani, were detained in Libya; the Swiss government asserted that the detention was done as retaliation against them for Gaddafi's arrest.\n\nAlso in 2008, Gaddafi lost a lawsuit he brought in Denmark against the Danish newspaper, \"Ekstra Bladet\". The newspaper reported that in 2005, Gaddafi, then a student in Copenhagen, had directed the abduction and beating of a Libyan national at the home of the Libyan consul in Gentofte. Gaddafi failed to appear in court to present his side of the case, and the court ruled that the existing evidence supported \"Ekstra Bladet's\" version of events.\n\nIn 2009, police were called to Claridge's Hotel in London in response to reports of a woman screaming.

In October 2012 they left a hideaway in Algeria to go to Oman, where they were granted political asylum.\n\nShweyga Mullah, an Ethiopian nanny who cared for the couple's young daughter and son was found abandoned by the rebels in a room at one of the family's luxury seaside villas in western Tripoli. She claimed that Aline Skaf took her to a bathroom, tied her up, taped her mouth and started pouring the boiling water on her head - after she lost her temper when Mullah refused to beat her daughter who was crying. Then Mullah was denied sleep, food and water for three days. Another member of staff, who did not want to give his name, verified Ms Mullah's story and said that he also had been regularly beaten and slashed with knives.\n\nOn 11 December 2015, Hannibal was kidnapped and briefly held in Lebanon by an armed group demanding information about disappearance of Shiite Imam Musa al-Sadr but later was released in the city of Baalbek. An arrest warrant was issued against him by the Lebanese government over the disappearance of al-Sadr and he was arrested. A request by the Syrian government to return Gaddafi on the grounds that he was a \"political refugee\" was denied by the Lebanese government as he is a wanted man in Lebanon for withholding information regarding the disappearance of al-Sadr.

He was educated at Wellington College. On 2 July 1913 Avery married Alice Maude Draper at the Church of the Nativity in Blenheim. The couple went on to have seven children between 1914 and 1929.\n\nA wing-forward, Avery represented Wellington at a provincial level from 1905 to 1910, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, on their tour of Australia in 1910. He played six matches for the All Blacks on that tour including three internationals.

{"id": "20893027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20893027", "title": "Istanbul Chamber of Commerce", "text": "Istanbul Chamber of Commerce\n\nThe Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ICOC) is an institution that organizes and records the commercial transactions of individuals and commercial institutions located in Istanbul; in addition the ICOC also keeps records for these companies. The activities of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce are for the most part carried out in the central building, located in Eminönü.\n\nIn elections held in March, 2005, Dr. Murat Yalçıntaş was elected to the post of president of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAs part of their concern for the commercial and industrial problems of the 19th century, the Ottoman State desired to bring together the representatives of the industrial sector into one institution. To this end, the Trade and Agricultural Council, which had been established in 1876, was very productive. Subsequently, Mehmed Said Pasha (1838–1914), who had been appointed as grand vizier (prime minister) in 1879, put a start to the processes that were necessary for the establishment of trade, industry and agricultural guilds.\nActing upon Said Pasha’s directive, a draft charter consisting of 11 articles was prepared for the establishment of a chamber of commerce that would be similar to those in Europe, particularly the French examples. This draft was accepted by the Council of Ministers (Meclis-i Mahsus) on 18 January 1880. The Council of Ministers ruled that the chamber was to be referred to as the Ticaret Odası and quoted the decision in the text of the charter as follows: \n“The establishment of a Ticaret Odası in Istanbul by the Meclis-i Mahsus has been ratified by Abdul Hamid II II on 19 January 1880. Thus, for the first time in the Ottoman territory the process concerned with the establishment of a local chamber of commerce has been completed. The stage to proceed to next will be the completion of the organizational processes and the start of the activities of the Dersaadet (Istanbul) Ticaret Odası.”\n\nThe administrative structure of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası was very different from that of a modern chamber of commerce. While modern chambers have separate committees to carry out executive and supervisory functions, all the functions of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası were carried out by one institution. According to the first regulations of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, 24 members formed the chamber council. In order to be a member of the council, one had to be at least 30 years of age, have dealt with trade for at least 5 years, not have been implicated in any felony or murder, nor have committed any shameful crime that damaged one’s reputation or honor or to have been bankrupted; if the candidate had gone bankrupt, then they should have been able to regain their honor and name before becoming a member. The members of the council were selected by a majority secret ballot; if the votes were tied, the elder candidate would be selected. It was forbidden for two members to be selected from the same company. \nThe members were selected by a twenty-person election committee, headed up by the minister of trade and agriculture; half of the commission was appointed by the minister, the other half by merchants. A majority vote among the members of the chamber would select a president and a vice-president, who would be ratified by the Ministry of Trade. The members of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası were elected for three years; that is, every year one-third of the members were newly appointed. If a member did not participate in the meetings for a period of six months without stating a good reason, they were considered to have resigned. \nThe Dersaadet Ticaret Odası would act on its own initiative or would be instructed in how to act by the Ministry of Trade when applied to, thus providing opportunities for the advancement of trade; this included functions like taking the necessary measures to develop trade and industry, carrying out changes required in trade functions, customs duties, the construction of ports, the functioning of steam boats in the rivers, post offices and telegraphs, railway construction, repairs of roads and bridges, the establishment of stock markets, and the publication of trade newspapers.\n\nThe internal regulations were prepared immediately after the establishment of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası and were presented to the Ministry of Trade for its approval. In this charter, the status of the Ticaret Odası was organized according to the total sovereignty of the state; this remained the status, without any serious change, until 1950.\n\nA “preparatory committee” headed up by Azaryan Efendi, which was known as the Cemıyet-i Ticariye (Trade Council), was established to prepare internal regulations. An “interim-institute” started to function with an official ceremony in April 1880; this body continued to operate until 14 January 1882. The organization of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası had been prepared by this same date. At the moment that the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası started to operate officially the Cemiyet-i Ticariye ceased to function; that is, the Cemiyet became the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası on 14 January 1882. The Cemiyet-i Ticaret met ten times until it was transformed into the Ticaret Odası, meeting to discuss the regulations of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, which had been prepared by the commission. The members were informed that the charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası had been approved by the ministry and the charter went into execution on 27 December 1881.\n\nThe internal charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, dated 16 August 1881 was organized in a detailed way, setting out the function of the duties and authorities of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası. The internal charter, which consisted of six main sections, included many articles concerned with the aim and duties of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, the method of convening, the duties of the president, the functioning of the Ticaret Odası and its procedures, the duties of the merchants, the position of the head secretary and officials, as well as with the income of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası.\n\nAccording to the internal charter of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, the Ticaret Odası had its own seal. On the top part of this seal was a “Crescent Moon and Star” symbol, while in the middle was inscribed: Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, surrounded by the French phrase Chambre de Commerce de Constantinople. All the documents that were dealt with in the Chamber of Commerce were to be stamped with this seal.\n\nThe members of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, who were summoned after the ratification of the internal charter, took the decision to carry out an official opening of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası; it was decided that the first meeting was to be held on 14 January 1882. Before the opening of the Chambers of the Commerce, 200 lira was loaned to the Cemiyet’s accountant Benzona Efendi by Azaryan Efendi, who was the chief of the Cemiyet at that date, to spend on fittings and office supplies. \nSome time later the members of the Ticaret Odası were convened again and it was decided that the opening ceremony of the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası, which was to go into operation on 14 January 1882, would be held in its own building and that this should be in a neighborhood that would be easy for tradesmen to reach. Upon this, the Dersaadet Ticaret Odası went into operation in flat No. 12, a property belonging to Mehmed Ali Pasha which was located on the shores of the Golden Horn. It was seen to be suitable that the opening ceremony be held in the same location.\nThe Dersaadet Ticaret Odası was opened with a simple ceremony in the Mehmed Ali Pasha Han (Business Quarters). At the opening, the minister of trade and agriculture, Raif Efendi, was present and made a speech.\n\nThe Istanbul Chamber of Commerce consists of two main structures, one established by election and one by appointment. The organs that are formed by election are the Meslek Komiteler (Professional Committees), Oda Meclisi (Chamber Assembly), Yönetim Kurulu (Board of Directors) and the Disiplin Kurulu (Disciplinary Board). The organs that are established by appointment are the Genel Sekreterlik (General Secretarat) and the Şube Müdürlük (Branch Directorate). There are 257 council members and 347 committee members who are appointed as results of elections held every four years; this makes up the structure of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Istanbul Chamber of Commerce is one of the largest chambers of commerce in the world, with a registered membership of 350,000. The Professional Committees of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce consists of approximately 90 elected Professional Committees. These committees are categorized according to NACE codes and are determined by the number of companies active in the related sector.\n\nThe Istanbul Commerce University was established by the ICOC Waqf and started to offer education in the 2001-2002 academic year; the president of the university is Dr. Sabri Orman, while the head of the board of trustees is Erhan Erken, a member of the ICOC Council. The university has started to provide education in its own buildings in Küçükyalı, which were purchased in 2007, in addition to its quarters in Üsküdar.\n\n3,860 students are pursuing undergraduate degrees while 412 students are completing post graduate courses. The Istanbul Commerce University consists of 5 faculties, an English preparatory department, and one vocational high school, 3 institutes (social sciences – science and engineering – foreign trade), 2 centers (the EU application and research center and the continuous training center) and 1 unit (the IT security application and research unit).\n\nThe Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has introduced 14 schools to the Turkish educational world; from the beginning of 2010 there are 4 vocational schools, an autistic children’s educational center, 8 primary schools - one in Lice, Diyarbakır and the others in Istanbul - and one multi-program high school.\n\n\nThe Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has also built 13 schools, one in Istanbul and 12 in different regions of Anatolia, in commemoration of Turkish martyrs. These schools are listed below:\n\nAn 8-classroom primary school in the Balaban Village of the Eğil Province of Diyarbakır, with 10 residential quarters for employees\n\nA 12-classroom primary school in the Altıntaş Province of Kütahya.\n\nAn 8-classroom primary school in the Kumçatı Village in the central province of Şırnak with 10 residential quarters for employees.\n\nA 16-classroom primary school in the Araklı province of Trabzon\n\nA 24-classroom primary school in the Davraz region of the central province of Isparta\n\nAn 8-classroom primary school and 6 residential quarters for employees in the Söğütlü township of Kelkit province in Gümüşhane\n\nAn 8-classroom primary school in the Alişar village in the Battalgazi province of Malatya\n\nA 40-classroom primary school in the Sultanbeyli district of Istanbul.\n\nAn 8-classroom primary school and 10 residential quarters for employees in the Şeyh Halil township of the Yıldızeli region of Sivas\n\nA 12-classroom primary school and 6 residential quarters for employees in the Terme Region of Samsun\n\nA 10-classroom primary school in the Bozon village of the Mezitli region of Mersin.\n\nAn 8-classroom primary school and residential quarters for employees in the Topluca village in the Çamlıhemşin region of Rize.\n\nA 10-classroom primary school and 6 residential quarters for employees in the Sızma township of the Selçuklu province of Konya\n\nThe Teknopark Istanbul Project has been led by the Permanent Undersecretariat of the Defense Industry, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, Airport Management and Aeronautical Industries A.Ş., Istanbul Commerce University, and Defense Technology Engineering and Commercial AŞ; as part of the scope of the project these institutions have provided direct support for the establishment of Teknopark Istanbul A.Ş. With the contract signed by the partners on March 12, 2010, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has become one of the founding partners of the project.\n\nITO-SSM Teknopark will be established on land that is part of the Advanced Technology Industry Park (İTEP), which is the property of the National Defense Ministry; this land makes up part of Sabiha Gökçen Airport. The most important characteristic of the Teknopark Istanbul Complex is that it will be established upon a structure that is formed from the public and private sectors and a university. The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce will set aside a budget of 50 million TL, and the park will be brought to life in an area measuring 5,000 square meters. In addition, a research center will be constructed. Teknopark Istanbul will, as part of its mission, work on advanced technology, including defense, space and aeronautics, biotechnology, nanotechnology and naval technologies.\n\nIn 2007 the Mesleki ve Teknik Eğitim Kursları (Vocational and Technical Training Courses) Project, ÖZİMEK, which has been brought into life as a joint venture by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ICOC), the Istanbul Special Provincial Administration and the Istanbul Regional Board of Education, is seen as being the largest career-training program in the Turkish Republic. The aim of the project is to protect, increase and develop employment, to help reduce unemployment by benefiting from trade and vocational training schools and institutions, and to provide vocational development, change and training to prepare officials or those still working in the sector so that they will be able to be employed in keeping with new technology and developments.\n\nThe İş-Kur project was included in later stages of the project. The first aim was to develop a project that would provide 500 students with certificates at 15 trade high schools, in 44 different branches; at the present time, three large institutions in Istanbul, which has a great need in this area, have provided 10,000 courses in 70 vocational schools, in 82 separate branches, producing 6,500 graduates. By 2011 the project will have trained 30,000 people.\n\nAs part of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, the website: “Human Resources Market” has been established for the graduates of these courses. Those who have graduated can register their resumes on this site and thus when seeking employees, employers will be able to give priority to those who have graduated from certified courses.\n\nIn 2006, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce began an e-ICOC project which enabled members to complete ICOC procedures online, including patents, archiving, documents and forms. The system has been integrated with the systems of other institutions with whom the Chamber of Commerce works, including notaries, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB), Bağ-Kur, the governor's office and the city councils. With the implementation of this project, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has aimed to minimize internal bureaucracy and make tracking documents easier, thus creating an efficient and paperless office.\n\nThe expansion of the Formula 1 Grand Prix into Turkey was initiated by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce. The Formula 1 facilities in Istanbul were successfully completed in 2005 when the first races were held. ICOC's partner TOBB, as well as the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and the Special Provincial Administration aided in the completion of the facilities. After the first two races, the operation of the Istanbul Formula 1 Grand Prix was privatized and transferred to a third party.\n\nThe Istanbul Chamber of Commerce has paid visits to the Gulf Region in order to benefit from the capital accumulation resulting from the increase in oil output. A large delegation, including many representatives from the construction sector, participated in the visits which were organized to Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As a result of the meetings with both the private sector and government officials, Turkish contractors have undertaken many important construction projects in this region. Furthermore, these meetings have yielded an increase in Gulf investments in Turkey. These visits and meetings have brought about extremely productive results both for Turkish investments in the Gulf countries, as well as for the Gulf countries' investments in Turkey.\n\nIn 2010, 140 Istanbul Chamber of Commerce members benefited from the Start-Exporting program. This project, this first of its type in Turkey, is held throughout the country and has to date trained organizations in many provincial chambers of commerce. Between January 12 and May 12, 2010, the Start-Exporting program, which was developed in collaboration with the Madrid Chamber of Commerce and Industry, reached the sixth step.\n\nIn 2007, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCHAMBERS) launched the first step in the U.S. Market project. The project aims to improve trade relations between Turkey and the United States and to ensure the access of Turkish firms to the world's largest market. After Doing Business seminars were organized in Istanbul and the United States, a comprehensive educational website on the two markets went into operation.\n\nThe Istanbul Investment and Trade Office has been opened in New York City. The Istanbul office, one of the many offices that have been opened in various financial centers, was opened in the Istanbul World Trade Center, hosted by the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce on October 4, 2010.\n\nA chronology of the history of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce is given below:\n\n"}

He worked in a variety of companies, including Electrol de México, CONESA, and COVIMEX de México. Between 1982 and 1985, he directed the Potros de Tijuana baseball club, which played in the Liga Mexicana del Pacífico. In 1984, he became the director general and a columnist of the \"Diario de Baja California\" newspaper, which began a career in media ownership for Bonilla. Through his company PSN (originally an acronym for Pacific Spanish Network, now Primer Sistema de Noticias), he directly operates XESS-AM 620 and XESDD-AM 1030 in Tijuana. He also owned XHENB-TV channel 29 in Ensenada, now a cable-only outlet, and his company Media Sports de México holds the concessions for two radio stations operated under brokerage agreements by American programmers, XEPE-AM 1700 and XHPRS-FM 105.7. Bonilla also acquired cable systems in Ensenada and Tecate. Bonilla also owned radio station KURS 1040 in San Diego through his company Quetzal Bilingual Communications; the station was sold in 2016 for $900,000.\n\nIn 2000, Bonilla, then a dual citizen of Mexico and the United States, joined the board of the Otay Water District in Otay Mesa, California. While in the US, he was a donor to Republican causes and even was on the California finance committee for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. In March 2012, he announced his resignation from the water board in order to run for federal deputy and simultaneously join the 2012 presidential campaign of Andrés Manuel López Obrador. At the same time, he renounced his dual citizenship, a move necessary to meet the constitutional requirements to run for office. He became a proportional representation deputy on the PT list, during which time he served as the president of the Northern Border Matters Commission and was the state campaign coordinator for the PT in the 2013 Baja California state elections. Bonilla left the post in 2014 in order to become the state party director for the then-new Morena party. His relationship with López Obrador remained close; in 2016, Bonilla invited him to his Petco Park suite for the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Party members and leaders say that in Bonilla's media holdings, López Obrador saw a \"gold mine\" to gain media exposure in Baja California.\n\nOn 31 January 2018, López Obrador announced that Bonilla would be the primary Senate candidate in Baja California for the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition, forming a ticket with Alejandra León Gastélum. The Juntos Haremos Historia ticket took first place in the election, securing both candidates seats in the Senate. However, Bonilla has stated that he will only remain in office three months and will then become the state development coordinator in Baja California.\n"}

The show still airs, as \"Showmatch\". \n\nHe created the TV production company \"Ideas del Sur\" (Ideas from the South), which has produced many TV shows including \"Okupas\", \"Buenos Vecinos\", \"Tumberos\", \"Fugitivos\" and \"Los Roldán\". He also bought Radio Uno FM station, and the Spanish Segunda División football club CD Badajoz. \n\nIn 2002, he helped found the volleyball team Club Ciudad de Bolívar, based in his native San Carlos de Bolívar. The team came to be the most successful of the Argentine league.\n\nHe became popular as the presenter of Argentina's high-rated show \"Videomatch\" on the Argentine network Telefe. The variety show had sketches, musical guests, contests, and introduced bloopers to the Argentine audience.\n\nTinelli caused controversy in 2005, when he announced plans to switch to Canal 9, the third highest rated network. His show increased the average audience of Canal 9 by giving the network the highest-rated show in the country. \n\nIn 2006 Tinelli announced a switch to El Trece, Telefe's largest competitor. Tinelli works at El Trece since then, and also produces TV dramas with his own production company, Ideas del Sur. The show title changed from \"Videomatch\" to \"Showmatch\" since the Videomatch name was owned by Telefe. \"Showmatch\" is also the name of a short-lived version of \"Videomatch\" that aired in Spain. \n\nShowMatch included many segments of contests with stage acts, such as dancing or singing. In 2009 it included a segment called Gran Cuñado (Big Brother-in-Law) with parodies of Argentine politicians, that generated great stir in real political world.\n\nTinelli married his first wife, Soledad Aquino, in 1986. The couple had two children: Micaela in (born in 1988), and Candelaria (born in 1990). The couple divorced in 1993. Following his divorce, in 1997 he married for the second time with Paula Robles. They met at one of the shows he hosted (Ritmo de la noche). The couple lasted 12 years, during that period of time they had two children. The couple divorced in 2009. In April 2014, Tinelli had his fifth child with Guillermina Valdes. \n\n"}

He attended The Phelps School, a boys' boarding school in Malvern, Pennsylvania, followed by college at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied management. His father abandoned the family when he was five years old, before dying by suicide in 1983.\n\nMellon was a direct descendant of Judge Thomas Mellon, founder of the Mellon Bank, now part of Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, on his paternal side. On his maternal side he was a direct descendant of Anthony Joseph Drexel, a banker whose investment firm was a precursor to Drexel Burnham Lambert. He maintained associations with Drexel University and Carnegie Mellon University, both of which were founded by family members. He was also involved with the National Gallery of Art, the core of whose collection was donated to the nation by his great-uncle, Andrew Mellon.\n\nMellon was named Finance Chairman by State Chairman Ed Cox in May 2011. In February 2018, \"Forbes\" magazine reported that Mellon's $2-million investment in the cryptocurrency XRP, turned into a $1-billion fortune.\n\nMellon had bipolar disorder, as did his father. Prior to their 2016 divorce, Mellon lived in New York City with his wife Nicole Hanley Mellon and their two children. He also had a daughter whom he raised jointly with his former wife, Tamara Mellon, the co-founder of shoe company Jimmy Choo. Prior to his marriage to Nicole, he was engaged to entrepreneur Noelle Reno, with whom he established a cashmere knitwear line. \n\nIn 2016, Mellon attended a treatment centre in Malibu, California, to deal with a reported addiction to the prescription opioid OxyContin, said to be costing him $100,000 a month. He was quoted as saying \"OxyContin is like legal heroin. And it needs to be addressed.\"\n\nAt the end of 2017 Mellon moved from New York to Los Angeles, renting a house in the Hollywood Hills for $150,000 a month. There, he led an active social life and began to spend much time with Kick Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. In late March, Mellon dined with President Donald Trump.\n\nMellon died in April 2018 in Cancun, Mexico, where he was planning to check in to the Clear Sky Recovery clinic, which specializes in ibogaine therapy, a medication with psychedelic properties. However, he was reported to have died in a hotel room in Cancun before arrival at the clinic, suffering a fatal heart attack after taking ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic drink.\n"}
{"id": "19390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19390", "title": "Money laundering", "text": "Money laundering\n\nMoney laundering is the act of concealing the transformation of profits from illegal activities and corruption into ostensibly \"legitimate\" assets. One problem of criminal activities is accounting for the proceeds without raising the suspicion of law enforcement agencies. Considerable time and effort may be put into strategies which enable the safe use of those proceeds without raising unwanted suspicion. Implementing such strategies is generally called money laundering. After money has been suitably laundered or \"cleaned\", it can be used in the mainstream economy for accumulation of wealth, such as by acquisitions of properties or legitimate businesses, or simply spent. Law enforcement agencies of many jurisdictions have set up sophisticated systems in an effort to detect suspicious transactions or activities, and many have set up international cooperative arrangements to assist each other in these endeavors.\nIn a number of legal and regulatory systems, the term \"money laundering\" has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \"source\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \"destination\" of funds) when regulating the financial system.\n\nSome countries treat obfuscation of sources of money as also constituting money laundering, whether it is intentional or by merely using financial systems or services that do not identify or track sources or destinations. Other countries define money laundering in such a way as to include money from activity that \"would have been\" a crime in that country, even if the activity was legal where the actual conduct occurred.\n\nLaws against money laundering were created to use against organized crime during the period of Prohibition in the United States during the 1930s. Organized crime received a major boost from Prohibition and a large source of new funds that were obtained from illegal sales of alcohol. The successful prosecution of Al Capone on tax evasion brought in a new emphasis by the state and law enforcement agencies to track and confiscate money, but existing laws against tax evasion could not be used once gangsters started paying their taxes.\n\nIn the 1980s, the war on drugs led governments again to turn to money-laundering rules in an attempt to seize proceeds of drug crimes in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit from a law enforcement point of view of turning rules of evidence upside down. Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to get a conviction. But with money laundering laws, money can be confiscated and it is up to the individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate if they want the funds back. This makes it much easier for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower burdens of proof.\n\nThe September 11 attacks in 2001, which led to the Patriot Act in the U.S. and similar legislation worldwide, led to a new emphasis on money laundering laws to combat terrorism financing. The Group of Seven (G7) nations used the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering to put pressure on governments around the world to increase surveillance and monitoring of financial transactions and share this information between countries. Starting in 2002, governments around the world upgraded money laundering laws and surveillance and monitoring systems of financial transactions. Anti money laundering regulations have become a much larger burden for financial institutions and enforcement has stepped up significantly. During 2011–2015 a number of major banks faced ever-increasing fines for breaches of money laundering regulations. This included HSBC, which was fined $1.9 billion in December 2012, and BNP Paribas, which was fined $8.9 billion in July 2014 by the U.S. government. Many countries introduced or strengthened border controls on the amount of cash that can be carried and introduced central transaction reporting systems where all financial institutions have to report all financial transactions electronically. For example, in 2006, Australia set up the AUSTRAC system and required the reporting of all financial transactions.\n\n The conversion or transfer of property, the concealment or disguising of the nature of the proceeds, the acquisition, possession or use of property, knowing that these are derived from criminal activity and participate or assist the movement of funds to make the proceeds appear legitimate is money laundering.\n\nMoney obtained from certain crimes, such as extortion, insider trading, drug trafficking, and illegal gambling is \"dirty\" and needs to be \"cleaned\" to appear to have been derived from legal activities, so that banks and other financial institutions will deal with it without suspicion. Money can be laundered by many methods which vary in complexity and sophistication.\n\nMoney laundering involves three steps: The first involves introducing cash into the financial system by some means (\"placement\"); the second involves carrying out complex financial transactions to camouflage the illegal source of the cash (\"layering\"); and finally, acquiring wealth generated from the transactions of the illicit funds (\"integration\"). Some of these steps may be omitted, depending upon the circumstances. For example, non-cash proceeds that are already in the financial system would not need to be placed.\n\nAccording to the United States Treasury Department:\nMoney laundering can take several forms, although most methods can be categorized into one of a few types. These include \"bank methods, smurfing [also known as structuring], currency exchanges, and double-invoicing\".\n\n\nIn Latin America, money laundering is mainly linked to drug trafficking activities and to having connections with criminal activity, such as crimes that have to do with arms trafficking, human trafficking, extortion, blackmail, smuggling, and acts of corruption of people linked to governments, such as bribery, which are more common in Latin American countries. There is a relationship between corruption and money laundering in developing countries. The economic power of Latin America increases rapidly and without support, these fortunes being of illicit origin have the appearance of legally acquired profits. With regard to money laundering, the ultimate goal of the process is to integrate illicit capital into the general economy and transform it into licit goods and services. \n\nThe money laundering practice uses various channels to legalize everything achieved through illegal practices. As such, it has different techniques depending on the country where this illegal operation is going to be carried out:\n\n\nCasinos continue to attract organizations that deal with money laundering. Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela are considered high priority countries in the region, due to the strategies used by the washers.\n\nThe practice of money laundering, among other economic and financial crimes have been better in infiltrating into the economic and political structures of most developing countries therefore resulting to political instability and economic digression.\n\nMoney laundering is still a great concern for the financial services industry. About 50% of the money laundering incidents in Latin America were reported by organizations in the financial sector. According to PwC’s 2014 global economic crime survey in Latin America only 2.8% of respondents in Latin America claimed suffering Anti-Trust/Competition Law incidents, compared to 5.2% of respondents globally. \n\nIt has been shown that money laundering has an impact on the financial behavior and macroeconomic performance of the industrialized countries. In these countries the macroeconomic consequences of money laundering are transmitted through several channels. Thus, money laundering complicates the formulation of economic policies. It is assumed that the proceeds of criminal activities are laundered by means of the notes and coins in circulation of the monetary substitutes.\n\nThe laundering causes disproportionate changes in the relative prices of assets which implies that resources are allocated inefficiently; and, therefore may have negative implications for economic growth, apparently money laundering is associated with a lower economic growth.\n\nThe Office of National Drug Control Policy of the United States estimates that only in that country, sales of narcotic drugs represent about 57,000 millions of dollars annually and most of these transactions are made in cash.\n\nMoney laundering has been increasing. A key factor behind the growing money laundering is ineffective enforcement of money laundering laws locally. Perhaps because of the lack of importance that has been given to the subject, since the 21st century started, there was not jurisprudence regarding the laundering of money or assets, or the conversion or transfer of goods. Which is even worse, the laws of the Latin American countries have really not dealt with their study in a profound way, as it is an issue that concerns the whole world and is the subject of seminars, conferences and academic analysis in different regions of the planet. Now a new figure that is being called the Economic Criminal Law is being implemented, which should be implemented in modern societies, which has been inflicted enormous damage to the point of affecting the general economy of the states. Even though, developing countries have responded and continue to respond, through legislative measures, to the problem of money laundering, at national level, however, money launderers, have taken advantage of the lax regulatory environment, vulnerable financial systems along with the continued civil and political unrest of most the developing countries.\n\nMany regulatory and governmental authorities issue estimates each year for the amount of money laundered, either worldwide or within their national economy. In 1996, a spokesperson for the IMF estimated that 2–5% of the worldwide global economy involved laundered money. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), an intergovernmental body set up to combat money laundering, stated, \"Due to the illegal nature of the transactions, precise statistics are not available and it is therefore impossible to produce a definitive estimate of the amount of money that is globally laundered every year. The FATF therefore does not publish any figures in this regard.\" Academic commentators have likewise been unable to estimate the volume of money with any degree of assurance. Various estimates of the scale of global money laundering are sometimes repeated often enough to make some people regard them as factual—but no researcher has overcome the inherent difficulty of measuring an actively concealed practice.\n\nRegardless of the difficulty in measurement, the amount of money laundered each year is in the billions of US dollars and poses a significant policy concern for governments. As a result, governments and international bodies have undertaken efforts to deter, prevent, and apprehend money launderers. Financial institutions have likewise undertaken efforts to prevent and detect transactions involving dirty money, both as a result of government requirements and to avoid the reputational risk involved. Issues relating to money laundering have existed as long as there have been large scale criminal enterprises. Modern anti-money laundering laws have developed along with the modern War on Drugs. In more recent times anti-money laundering legislation is seen as adjunct to the financial crime of terrorist financing in that both crimes usually involve the transmission of funds through the financial system (although money laundering relates to where the money has come \"from\", and terrorist financing relating to where the money is going \"to\").\n\nIn theory, electronic money should provide as easy a method of transferring value without revealing identity as untracked banknotes, especially wire transfers involving anonymity-protecting numbered bank accounts. In practice, however, the record-keeping capabilities of Internet service providers and other network resource maintainers tend to frustrate that intention. While some cryptocurrencies under recent development have aimed to provide for more possibilities of transaction anonymity for various reasons, the degree to which they succeed—and, in consequence, the degree to which they offer benefits for money laundering efforts—is controversial. Solutions such as ZCash and Monero are examples of cryptocurrencies that provide unlinkable anonymity via proofs and/or obfuscation of information (ring signatures). Such currencies could find use in online illicit services.\n\nIn 2013, Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at ESSEC ISIS, surveyed new techniques that cybercriminals were using in a report written for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. A common approach was to use a digital currency exchanger service which converted dollars into a digital currency called Liberty Reserve, and could be sent and received anonymously. The receiver could convert the Liberty Reserve currency back into cash for a small fee. In May 2013, the US authorities shut down Liberty Reserve charging its founder and various others with money laundering.\n\nAnother increasingly common way of laundering money is to use online gaming. In a growing number of online games, such as \"Second Life\" and \"World of Warcraft,\" it is possible to convert money into virtual goods, services, or virtual cash that can later be converted back into money.\n\nReverse money laundering is a process that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes. It is usually perpetrated for the purpose of financing terrorism but can be also used by criminal organizations that have invested in legal businesses and would like to withdraw legitimate funds from official circulation. Unaccounted cash received via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay \"under-the-table\" salaries. For example, in an affidavit filed on 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V. Pascau alleged that several people associated with the Chee Kung Tong organization, and California State Senator Leland Yee, engaged in reverse money laundering activities.\n\nThe problem of such fraudulent encashment practices (\"obnalichka\" in Russian) has become acute in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG) reported that the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Turkey, Serbia, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia and Kazakhstan have encountered a substantial shrinkage of tax base and shifting money supply balance in favor of cash. These processes have complicated planning and management of the economy and contributed to the growth of the shadow economy.\n\nAnti-money laundering (AML) is a term mainly used in the financial and legal industries to describe the legal controls that require financial institutions and other regulated entities to prevent, detect, and report money laundering activities. Anti-money laundering guidelines came into prominence globally as a result of the formation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the promulgation of an international framework of anti-money laundering standards. These standards began to have more relevance in 2000 and 2001, after FATF began a process to publicly identify countries that were deficient in their anti-money laundering laws and international cooperation, a process colloquially known as \"name and shame\".\n\nAn effective AML program requires a jurisdiction to criminalise money laundering, giving the relevant regulators and police the powers and tools to investigate; be able to share information with other countries as appropriate; and require financial institutions to identify their customers, establish risk-based controls, keep records, and report suspicious activities.\n\nStrict background checks are necessary to combat as many money launderers escape by investing through complex ownership and company structures. Banks can do that but a proper surveillance is required but on the Government side to reduce this. \n\nThe elements of the crime of money laundering are set forth in the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. It is defined as knowingly engaging in a financial transaction with the proceeds of a crime for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property from governments.\n\nWhile banks operating in the same country generally have to follow the same anti-money laundering laws and regulations, financial institutions all structure their anti-money laundering efforts slightly differently. Today, most financial institutions globally, and many non-financial institutions, are required to identify and report transactions of a suspicious nature to the financial intelligence unit in the respective country. For example, a bank must verify a customer's identity and, if necessary, monitor transactions for suspicious activity. This is often termed as \"know your customer\". This means knowing the identity of the customer and understanding the kinds of transactions in which the customer is likely to engage. By knowing one's customers, financial institutions can often identify unusual or suspicious behaviour, termed anomalies, which may be an indication of money laundering.\n\nBank employees, such as tellers and customer account representatives, are trained in anti-money laundering and are instructed to report activities that they deem suspicious. Additionally, anti-money laundering software filters customer data, classifies it according to level of suspicion, and inspects it for anomalies. Such anomalies include any sudden and substantial increase in funds, a large withdrawal, or moving money to a bank secrecy jurisdiction. Smaller transactions that meet certain criteria may also be flagged as suspicious. For example, structuring can lead to flagged transactions. The software also flags names on government \"blacklists\" and transactions that involve countries hostile to the host nation. Once the software has mined data and flagged suspect transactions, it alerts bank management, who must then determine whether to file a report with the government.\n\nThe financial services industry has become more vocal about the rising costs of anti-money laundering regulation and the limited benefits that they claim it brings. One commentator wrote that \"[w]ithout facts, [anti-money laundering] legislation has been driven on rhetoric, driving by ill-guided activism responding to the need to be \"seen to be doing something\" rather than by an objective understanding of its effects on predicate crime. The social panic approach is justified by the language used—we talk of the battle against terrorism or the war on drugs\". \"The Economist\" magazine has become increasingly vocal in its criticism of such regulation, particularly with reference to countering terrorist financing, referring to it as a \"costly failure\", although it concedes that other efforts (like reducing identity and credit card fraud) may still be effective at combating money laundering.\n\nThere is no precise measurement of the costs of regulation balanced against the harms associated with money laundering, and given the evaluation problems involved in assessing such an issue, it is unlikely that the effectiveness of terror finance and money laundering laws could be determined with any degree of accuracy. \"The Economist\" estimated the annual costs of anti-money laundering efforts in Europe and North America at US$5 billion in 2003, an increase from US$700 million in 2000. Government-linked economists have noted the significant negative effects of money laundering on economic development, including undermining domestic capital formation, depressing growth, and diverting capital away from development. Because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the amount of money laundered, changes in the amount of money laundered, and the cost of anti-money laundering systems, it is almost impossible to tell which anti-money laundering systems work and which are more or less cost effective.\n\nBesides economic costs to implement anti-money-laundering laws, improper attention to data protection practices may entail disproportionate costs to individual privacy rights. In June 2011, the data-protection advisory committee to the European Union issued a report on data protection issues related to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, which identified numerous transgressions against the established legal framework on privacy and data protection. The report made recommendations on how to address money laundering and terrorist financing in ways that safeguard personal privacy rights and data protection laws. In the United States, groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have expressed concern that money laundering rules require banks to report on their own customers, essentially conscripting private businesses \"into agents of the surveillance state\".\n\nMany countries are obligated by various international instruments and standards, such as the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, the 2000 Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the 2003 United Nations Convention against Corruption, and the recommendations of the 1989 Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) to enact and enforce money laundering laws in an effort to stop narcotics trafficking, international organised crime, and corruption. Mexico, which has faced a significant increase in violent crime, established anti-money laundering controls in 2013 to curb the underlying crime issue.\n\nFormed in 1989 by the G7 countries, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) is an intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote an international response to combat money laundering. The FATF Secretariat is housed at the headquarters of the OECD in Paris. In October 2001, FATF expanded its mission to include combating the financing of terrorism. FATF is a policy-making body that brings together legal, financial, and law enforcement experts to achieve national legislation and regulatory AML and CFT reforms. its membership consists of 36 countries and territories and two regional organizations. FATF works in collaboration with a number of international bodies and organizations. These entities have observer status with FATF, which does not entitle them to vote, but permits them full participation in plenary sessions and working groups.\n\nFATF has developed 40 recommendations on money laundering and 9 special recommendations regarding terrorist financing. FATF assesses each member country against these recommendations in published reports. Countries seen as not being sufficiently compliant with such recommendations are subjected to financial sanctions.\n\nFATF's three primary functions with regard to money laundering are:\n\nThe FATF currently comprises 34 member jurisdictions and 2 regional organisations, representing most major financial centres in all parts of the globe.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime maintains the \"International Money Laundering Information Network\", a website that provides information and software for anti-money laundering data collection and analysis. The World Bank has a website that provides policy advice and best practices to governments and the private sector on anti-money laundering issues. The Basel AML Index is an independent annual ranking that assesses the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing around the world. \n\nMany jurisdictions adopt a list of specific predicate crimes for money laundering prosecutions, while others criminalize the proceeds of any serious crimes.\n\nThe Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Afghanistan (FinTRACA) was established as a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the Anti Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Law passed by decree late in 2004. The main purpose of this law is to protect the integrity of the Afghan financial system and to gain compliance with international treaties and conventions. The Financial Intelligence Unit is a semi-independent body that is administratively housed within the Central Bank of Afghanistan (Da Afghanistan Bank). The main objective of FinTRACA is to deny the use of the Afghan financial system to those who obtained funds as the result of illegal activity, and to those who would use it to support terrorist activities.\n\nTo meet its objectives, the FinTRACA collects and analyzes information from a variety of sources. These sources include entities with legal obligations to submit reports to the FinTRACA when a suspicious activity is detected, as well as reports of cash transactions above a threshold amount specified by regulation. Also, FinTRACA has access to all related Afghan government information and databases. When the analysis of this information supports the supposition of illegal use of the financial system, the FinTRACA works closely with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the illegal activity. FinTRACA also cooperates internationally in support of its own analyses and investigations and to support the analyses and investigations of foreign counterparts, to the extent allowed by law. Other functions include training of those entities with legal obligations to report information, development of laws and regulations to support national-level AML objectives, and international and regional cooperation in the development of AML typologies and countermeasures.\n\nAustralia has adopted a number of strategies to combat money laundering, which mirror those of a majority of western countries. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is Australia's financial intelligence unit to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, which requires financial institutions and other 'cash dealers' in Australia to report to it suspicious cash or other transactions and other specific information. The Attorney-General's Department maintains a list of outlawed terror organisations. It is an offense to materially support or be supported by such organisations. It is an offence to open a bank account in Australia in a false name, and rigorous procedures must be followed when new bank accounts are opened. \n\nThe \"Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006\" (Cth) (AML/CTF Act) is the principal legislative instrument, although there are also offence provisions contained in Division 400 of the \"Criminal Code Act 1995\" (Cth). Upon its introduction, it was intended that the AML/CTF Act would be further amended by a second tranche of reforms extending to designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) including, inter alia, lawyers, accountants, jewellers and real estate agents; however, those further reforms have yet to be progressed.\n\nThe \"Proceeds of Crime Act 1987\" (Cth) imposes criminal penalties on a person who engages in money laundering, and allows for confiscation of property. The principal objects of the Act are set out in s.3(1):\n\n\nThe first anti-money laundering legislation in Bangladesh was the \"Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2002\". It was replaced by the \"Money Laundering Prevention Ordinance 2008\". Subsequently, the ordinance was repealed by the \"Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2009\". In 2012, government again replace it with the \"Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012\"\n\nIn terms of section 2, \"Money Laundering means – (i) knowingly moving, converting, or transferring proceeds of crime or property involved in an offence for the following purposes:- (1) concealing or disguising the illicit nature, source, location, ownership or control of the proceeds of crime; or (2) assisting any person involved in the commission of the predicate offence to evade the legal consequences of such offence; (ii) smuggling money or property earned through legal or illegal means to a foreign country; (iii) knowingly transferring or remitting the proceeds of crime to a foreign country or remitting or bringing them into Bangladesh from a foreign country with the intention of hiding or disguising its illegal source; or (iv) concluding or attempting to conclude financial transactions in such a manner so as to reporting requirement under this Act may be avoided;(v) converting or moving or transferring property with the intention to instigate or assist for committing a predicate offence; (vi) acquiring, possessing or using any property, knowing that such property is the proceeds of a predicate offence; (vii) performing such activities so as to the illegal source of the proceeds of crime may be concealed or disguised; (viii) participating in, associating with, conspiring, attempting, abetting, instigate or counsel to commit any offences mentioned above.\n\nTo prevent these Illegal uses of money, the Bangladesh government has introduced the Money Laundering Prevention Act. The Act was last amended in the year 2009 and all the financial institutes are following this act. Till today there are 26 circulars issued by Bangladesh Bank under this act. To prevent money laundering, a banker must do the following:\n\nIn 1991, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was brought into force in Canada to give legal effect to the former FATF Forty Recommendations by establishing record keeping and client identification requirements in the financial sector to facilitate the investigation and prosecution of money laundering offences under the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.\n\nIn 2000, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was amended to expand the scope of its application and to establish a financial intelligence unit with national control over money laundering, namely FINTRAC.\n\nIn December 2001, the scope of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was again expanded by amendments enacted under the Anti-Terrorism Act with the objective of deterring terrorist activity by cutting off sources and channels of funding used by terrorists in response to 9/11. The Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Act was renamed the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.\n\nIn December 2006, the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act was further amended, in part, in response to pressure from the FATF for Canada to tighten its money laundering and financing of terrorism legislation. The amendments expanded the client identification, record-keeping and reporting requirements for certain organizations and included new obligations to report attempted suspicious transactions and outgoing and incoming international electronic fund transfers, undertake risk assessments and implement written compliance procedures in respect of those risks.\n\nThe amendments also enabled greater money laundering and terrorist financing intelligence-sharing among enforcement agencies.\n\nIn Canada, casinos, money service businesses, notaries, accountants, banks, securities brokers, life insurance agencies, real estate salespeople and dealers in precious metals and stones are subject to the reporting and record keeping obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.\n\nThe fourth and latest iteration of the EU’s anti-money laundering directive (AMLD IV) was published on 5 June 2015, after clearing its last legislative stop at the European Parliament. The new directive brings the EU’s anti-money laundering laws more in line with the US’s, which is welcome news for financial institutions that are operating in both jurisdictions. The Fifth Money Laundering Directive (5MLD) will come into force on the 10th January 2020. It will address a number of weaknesses in the European Union’s AML/CFT regime that have come to light since the enactment of the Fourth Money Laundering Directive AMLD IV).\n\nLack of harmonization in AML requirements between the US and EU has complicated the compliance efforts of global institutions that are looking to standardize the Know Your Customer (KYC) component of their AML programs across key jurisdictions. AMLD IV promises to better align the AML regimes by adopting a more risk-based approach compared to its predecessor, AMLD III.\n\nCertain components of the directive, however, go beyond current requirements in both the EU and US, imposing new implementation challenges on banks. For instance, more public officials are brought within the scope of the directive, and EU member states are required to establish new registries of “beneficial owners” (i.e., those who ultimately own or control each company) which will impact banks. AMLD IV became effective 25 June 2015.\n\nIn 2002, the Parliament of India passed an act called the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The main objectives of this act are to prevent money-laundering as well as to provide for confiscation of property either derived from or involved in, money-laundering.\n\nSection 12 (1) describes the obligations that banks, other financial institutions, and intermediaries have to \n\nSection 12 (2) prescribes that the records referred to in sub-section (1) as mentioned above, must be maintained for ten years after the transactions finished. It is handled by the Indian Income Tax Department.\n\nThe provisions of the Act are frequently reviewed and various amendments have been passed from time to time.\n\nMost money laundering activities in India are through political parties, corporate companies and the shares market. These are investigated by the Enforcement Directorate and Indian Income Tax Department. According to Government of India, out of the total tax arrears of about pertain to money laundering and securities scam cases.\n\nBank accountants must record all transactions over Rs. 1 million and maintain such records for 10 years. Banks must also make cash transaction reports (CTRs) and suspicious transaction reports over Rs. 1 million within 7 days of initial suspicion. They must submit their reports to the Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax Department.\n\nSingapore’s legal framework for combating money laundering is contained in a patchwork of legal instruments, the main elements of which are:\nThe term ‘money laundering’ is not used as such within the CDSA. Part VI of the CDSA criminalises the laundering of proceeds generated by criminal conduct and drug tracking via the following offences:\n\nMoney laundering and terrorist funding legislation in the UK is governed by four Acts of primary legislation:-\n\nMoney Laundering Regulations are designed to protect the UK financial system, as well as preventing and detecting crime. If a business is covered by these regulations then controls are put in place to prevent it being used for money laundering.\n\nThe Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 contains the primary UK anti-money laundering legislation, including provisions requiring businesses within the \"regulated sector\" (banking, investment, money transmission, certain professions, etc.) to report to the authorities suspicions of money laundering by customers or others.\n\nMoney laundering is broadly defined in the UK. In effect any handling or involvement with any proceeds of any crime (or monies or assets representing the proceeds of crime) can be a money laundering offence. An offender's possession of the proceeds of his own crime falls within the UK definition of money laundering. The definition also covers activities within the traditional definition of money laundering, as a process that conceals or disguises the proceeds of crime to make them appear legitimate.\n\nUnlike certain other jurisdictions (notably the US and much of Europe), UK money laundering offences are not limited to the proceeds of serious crimes, nor are there any monetary limits. Financial transactions need no money laundering design or purpose for UK laws to consider them a money laundering offence. A money laundering offence under UK legislation need not even involve money, since the money laundering legislation covers assets of any description. In consequence, any person who commits an acquisitive crime (i.e., one that produces some benefit in the form of money or an asset of any description) in the UK inevitably also commits a money laundering offence under UK legislation.\n\nThis applies also to a person who, by criminal conduct, evades a liability (such as a taxation liability)—which lawyers call \"obtaining a pecuniary advantage\"—as he is deemed thereby to obtain a sum of money equal in value to the liability evaded.\n\nThe principal money laundering offences carry a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment.\n\nSecondary regulation is provided by the Money Laundering Regulations 2003, which was replaced by the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. They are directly based on the EU directives 91/308/EEC, 2001/97/EC and 2005/60/EC.\n\nOne consequence of the Act is that solicitors, accountants, tax advisers, and insolvency practitioners who suspect (as a consequence of information received in the course of their work) that their clients (or others) have engaged in tax evasion or other criminal conduct that produced a benefit, now must report their suspicions to the authorities (since these entail suspicions of money laundering). In most circumstances it would be an offence, \"tipping-off\", for the reporter to inform the subject of his report that a report has been made. These provisions do not however require disclosure to the authorities of information received by certain professionals in privileged circumstances or where the information is subject to legal professional privilege. Others that are subject to these regulations include financial institutions, credit institutions, estate agents (which includes chartered surveyors), trust and company service providers, high value dealers (who accept cash equivalent to €15,000 or more for goods sold), and casinos.\n\nProfessional guidance (which is submitted to and approved by the UK Treasury) is provided by industry groups including the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group, the Law Society. and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB).\nHowever, there is no obligation on banking institutions to routinely report monetary deposits or transfers above a specified value. Instead reports must be made of all suspicious deposits or transfers, irrespective of their value.\n\nThe reporting obligations include reporting suspicious gains from conduct in other countries that would be criminal if it took place in the UK. Exceptions were later added for certain activities legal where they took place, such as bullfighting in Spain.\n\nMore than 200,000 reports of suspected money laundering are submitted annually to authorities in the UK (there were 240,582 reports in the year ended 30 September 2010. This was an increase from the 228,834 reports submitted in the previous year). Most of these reports are submitted by banks and similar financial institutions (there were 186,897 reports from the banking sector in the year ended 30 September 2010).\n\nAlthough 5,108 different organisations submitted suspicious activity reports to the authorities in the year ended 30 September 2010, just four organisations submitted approximately half of all reports, and the top 20 reporting organisations accounted for three-quarters of all reports.\n\nThe offence of failing to report a suspicion of money laundering by another person carries a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment.\n\nOn May 1, 2018, the UK House of Commons, without opposition, passed the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, which will set out the UK government’s intended approach to exceptions and licenses when the nation becomes responsible for implementing its own sanctions and will also require notorious overseas British territory tax havens such as the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to establish public registers of the beneficial ownership of firms in their jurisdictions by the end of 2020. The legislation was passed by the House of Lords on May 21 and received Royal Asset on May 23. However, the Act's public register provision is facing legal challenges from local governments in the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands, who argue that it violates their Constitutional sovereignty.\n\nAll UK \"Bureaux de change\" are registered with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, which issues a trading licence for each location. Bureaux de change and money transmitters, such as Western Union outlets, in the UK fall within the \"regulated sector\" and are required to comply with the Money Laundering Regulations 2007. Checks can be carried out by HMRC on all Money Service Businesses.\n\nIn South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre Act (2001) and subsequent amendments have added responsibilities to the FSB to combat money laundering.\n\nThe approach in the United States to stopping money laundering is usually broken into two areas: preventive (regulatory) measures and criminal measures.\n\nIn an attempt to prevent dirty money from entering the U.S. financial system in the first place, the United States Congress passed a series of laws, starting in 1970, collectively known as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). These laws, contained in sections 5311 through 5332 of Title 31 of the United States Code, require financial institutions, which under the current definition include a broad array of entities, including banks, credit card companies, life insurers, money service businesses and broker-dealers in securities, to report certain transactions to the United States Department of the Treasury. Cash transactions in excess of a certain amount must be reported on a currency transaction report (CTR), identifying the individual making the transaction as well as the source of the cash. The law originally required all transactions of US$5,000 or more to be reported, but due to excessively high levels of reporting the threshold was raised to US$10,000. The U.S. is one of the few countries in the world to require reporting of all cash transactions over a certain limit, although certain businesses can be exempt from the requirement. Additionally, financial institutions must report transaction on a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) that they deem \"suspicious\", defined as a knowing or suspecting that the funds come from illegal activity or disguise funds from illegal activity, that it is structured to evade BSA requirements or appears to serve no known business or apparent lawful purpose; or that the institution is being used to facilitate criminal activity. Attempts by customers to circumvent the BSA, generally by structuring cash deposits to amounts lower than US$10,000 by breaking them up and depositing them on different days or at different locations also violates the law.\n\nThe financial database created by these reports is administered by the U.S.'s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), located in Vienna, Virginia. The reports are made available to U.S. criminal investigators, as well as other FIU's around the globe, and FinCEN conducts computer assisted analyses of these reports to determine trends and refer investigations.\n\nThe BSA requires financial institutions to engage in customer due diligence, or KYC, which is sometimes known in the parlance as know your customer. This includes obtaining satisfactory identification to give assurance that the account is in the customer's true name, and having an understanding of the expected nature and source of the money that flows through the customer's accounts. Other classes of customers, such as those with private banking accounts and those of foreign government officials, are subjected to enhanced due diligence because the law deems that those types of accounts are a higher risk for money laundering. All accounts are subject to ongoing monitoring, in which internal bank software scrutinizes transactions and flags for manual inspection those that fall outside certain parameters. If a manual inspection reveals that the transaction is suspicious, the institution should file a Suspicious Activity Report.\n\nThe regulators of the industries involved are responsible to ensure that the financial institutions comply with the BSA. For example, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regularly inspect banks, and may impose civil fines or refer matters for criminal prosecution for non-compliance. A number of banks have been fined and prosecuted for failure to comply with the BSA. Most famously, Riggs Bank, in Washington D.C., was prosecuted and functionally driven out of business as a result of its failure to apply proper money laundering controls, particularly as it related to foreign political figures.\n\nIn addition to the BSA, the U.S. imposes controls on the movement of currency across its borders, requiring individuals to report the transportation of cash in excess of US$10,000 on a form called Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments (known as a CMIR). Likewise, businesses, such as automobile dealerships, that receive cash in excess of US$10,000 must file a Form 8300 with the Internal Revenue Service, identifying the source of the cash.\n\nOn 1 September 2010, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued an advisory on \"informal value transfer systems\" referencing \"United States v. Banki\".\n\nIn the United States, there are perceived consequences of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. These unintended consequences include FinCEN's publishing of a list of \"risky businesses,\" which many believe unfairly targeted money service businesses. The publishing of this list and the subsequent fall-out, banks indiscriminately de-risking MSBs, is referred to as Operation Choke Point. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a Geographic Targeting Order to combat against illegal money laundering in the United States. This means that title insurance companies in the U.S. are required to identify the natural persons behind companies that pay all cash in residential real estate purchases over a particular amount in certain U.S. cities.\n\nMoney laundering has been criminalized in the United States since the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986. The law, contained at section 1956 of Title 18 of the United States Code, prohibits individuals from engaging in a financial transaction with proceeds that were generated from certain specific crimes, known as \"specified unlawful activities\" (SUAs). The law requires that an individual specifically intend in making the transaction to conceal the source, ownership or control of the funds. There is no minimum threshold of money, and no requirement that the transaction succeeded in actually disguising the money. A \"financial transaction\" has been broadly defined, and need not involve a financial institution, or even a business. Merely passing money from one person to another, with the intent to disguise the source, ownership, location or control of the money, has been deemed a financial transaction under the law. The possession of money without either a financial transaction or an intent to conceal is not a crime in the United States. Besides money laundering, the law contained in section 1957 of Title 18 of the United States Code, prohibits spending more than US$10,000 derived from an SUA, regardless of whether the individual wishes to disguise it. It carries a lesser penalty than money laundering, and unlike the money laundering statute, requires that the money pass through a financial institution.\n\nAccording to the records compiled by the United States Sentencing Commission, in 2009, the United States Department of Justice typically convicted a little over 81,000 people; of this, approximately 800 are convicted of money laundering as the primary or most serious charge.\nThe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 expanded the definition of financial institution to include businesses such as car dealers and real estate closing personnel and required them to file reports on large currency transaction. It required verification of identity of those who purchase monetary instruments over $3,000. The Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 strengthened sanctions for BSA violations, required so called \"Suspicious Activity Reports\" and eliminated previously used \"Criminal Referral Forms\", required verification and recordkeeping for wire transfers and established the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG). The Money Laundering Suppression Act from 1994 required banking agencies to review and enhance training, develop anti-money laundering examination procedures, review and enhance procedures for referring cases to law enforcement agencies, streamlined the Currency transaction report exemption process, required each Money services business (MSB) to be registered by an owner or controlling person, required every MSB to maintain a list of businesses authorized to act as agents in connection with the financial services offered by the MSB, made operating an unregistered MSB a federal crime, and recommended that states adopt uniform laws applicable to MSBs. The Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998 required banking agencies to develop anti-money laundering training for examiners, required the Department of the Treasury and other agencies to develop a \"National Money Laundering Strategy\", created the \"High Intensity Money Laundering and Related Financial Crime Area\" (HIFCA) Task Forces to concentrate law enforcement efforts at the federal, state and local levels in zones where money laundering is prevalent. HIFCA zones may be defined geographically or can be created to address money laundering in an industry sector, a financial institution, or group of financial institutions.\n\nThe Intelligence Reform & Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 amended the Bank Secrecy Act to require the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations requiring certain financial institutions to report cross-border electronic transmittals of funds, if the Secretary determines that reporting is \"reasonably necessary\" in \"anti-money laundering /combatting financing of terrorists (Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism AML/CFT).\n\n\nTo prevent the usage of decentralized digital money such as Bitcoin for the profit of crime and corruption, Australia is planning to strengthen the nation's anti-money laundering laws.\nKnowing the characteristics of Bitcoin, it is completely deterministic, protocol based and cannot be censored, may circumvent national laws using services like Tor to obfuscate transaction origins, and relies completely off of cryptography, not a central entity running under a KYC framework. There are several cases of criminals have cashed out a significant amount of Bitcoin after ransomware attacks, drug dealings, cyber fraud and gunrunning. Other damages such as The DAO being drained of Ether cannot be classified as money laundering under any legal definition, as decentralized virtual environments are legally stateless and cannot be intervened with by a governing body. Such an incident has been debated as to the clear definition of money laundering in a stateless environment, leading to Ethereum Classic to form.\n\n"}

Gregorio del Pilar (responsible for the eventual surrender of the Spanish forces) and a representative to the Malolos Congress. He was elected the Governor General of Bulacan immediately following the Philippine–American War. Tecson later served as Insular Secretary of the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture.\n\nPablo Tecson was born July 4, 1859 in San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan Province, Philippines; the son of Tiburcio Tecson and Paula Ocampo. He studied in San Miguel and later, at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Intramuros, Manila (where he finished his Bachelor of Arts program).\n\nTecson worked as a writer for a Spanish-era magazine, the \"Catholic Periodical Guide\" (\"Pahayagan Patnubay ng Catolico\"), in Malolos, the county seat of Bulacan; its initial publication being in April 1890.\n\nWhen the revolution against Spain broke out, Tecson was an officer in the Spanish Civil Guards (\"Guardia Civil\") in San Miguel.\n\nIn 1896, Tecson co-founded the Arao (\"Balangay Arao\") branch of a secret society-turned-revolutionary government, the Katipunan (\"Kataastaasang Kagalanggalangang Katipunan\", or \"KKK\")(Filipino: \"nang mga anak nang bayan\"), which operated out of San Miguel.\n\nOn December 14, 1897 the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, was signed in Tecson's residence. It called for a truce between Spanish Colonial Governor-General Fernando Primo de Rivera, and insurgent leader, Emilio Aguinaldo, to end the Philippine Revolution. Aguinaldo and his fellow revolutionaries were given amnesty and money and agreed to go into voluntary exile in Hong Kong. (Aguinaldo later used the money to purchase firearms.) Following Aguinaldo's return from exile in Hong Kong, Tecson defected from the Civil Guards and joined Aguinaldo's Republican Army as a captain.\n\nFollowing the \"Cry of Nueva Ecija\", he fought alongside General Manuel Tinio (especially in Nueva Ecija) and General Francisco Macabulos. He himself was eventually ranked brigadier general under del Pilar.\n\nOn May 24, 1898, Tecson launched attacks on the Spanish Civil Guard garrisons in San Miguel and San Rafael, Bulacan (collectively known as the Battle of San Miguel); which ended with the Spanish force's surrender on June 1, 1898.\n\nIn 1898, Tecson represented the province of Cagayan at the Malolos Congress (which drafted the Charter of the First Philippine Republic) a few months before the outbreak of the war with America. He cast the deciding vote which addressed the constitutional provision of the separation of church and state.\n\nThe Battle of Quingua was fought on April 23, 1899, in Quingua, Bulacan (now Plaridel), which resulted in a rout of the Filipinos by their former allies, the United States.\n\nTecson was elected governor general of Bulacan—the first accepted under American rule, serving from 1902–1906. In 1904, he was named as a delegate of the Philippine's Worlds Fair Commission. Tecson resigned from government service in 1906 and went into farming. He was one of the first to promote the silk culture industry in the Philippines. He returned to government service in 1907, becoming the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture.\n\nTecson donated the land for the use of the Constabulary Station (\"Barangay Sibul Spring\") in San Miguel. This was later named Camp Tecson. Tecson died in 1933 and is buried in San Miguel. At his death, he donated land for a public burial ground for Filipino patriots.\n\n"}

{"id": "1086493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1086493", "title": "Sol Kerzner", "text": "Sol Kerzner\n\nSolomon (Sol) Kerzner, K.C.M.G. (born 23 August 1935) is a South African accountant and business magnate. His family started a hotel chain; after Kerzner graduated with a B.Com (Accounting), B.Com (Hons) (Accounting) from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and qualified as a Chartered Accountant, he took over the running of the group and went on to create the most successful hotel group in South Africa, Sun International. He is now the Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Kerzner International and his career spans more than 45 years in the resort industry. He founded both of South Africa's largest hotel groups, Southern Sun Hotel Group.\n\nKerzner was born in Troyeville, Johannesburg, South Africa, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. His parents owned and operated a chain of kosher hotels. Kerzner graduated with a degree in accounting and then took control of the family company. In 1962, he purchased the Astra Hotel in Durban. Following the success of that property, Kerzner built South Africa's first five-star graded hotel in Umhlanga, a village north of Durban – he opened this resort in December 1964 which he named the Beverly Hills Hotel.\n\nFollowing the Beverly Hills, Kerzner built the 450-room Elangeni Hotel (now renamed Southern Sun Elangeni & Maharani), overlooking Durban's beachfront and, in 1969, in partnership with South African Breweries, he established the chain of Southern Sun Hotels, which by 1983 operated 30 luxury hotels with more than 7,000 rooms. In 1975, Kerzner opened his first hotel outside South Africa on the Indian Ocean Island of Mauritius which he named Le Saint Géran.\n\nIn 1979 Kerzner developed Sun City, the most ambitious resort project in Africa. Over a period of ten years he built four hotels, a man-made lake, two Gary Player designed championship golf courses and entertainment center with an indoor 6,000-seat multi-purpose arena in which he presented many superstars including Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Queen and Shirley Bassey and which was also the venue of many World Title fights promoted by Bob Arum's Top Rank organisation. During 1985, Kerzner's Sun City, South Africa resort was the topic of anti-Apartheid rock album titled \"Sun City\" by a group of rock musicians calling themselves Artists United Against Apartheid.\n\nIn 1994, following the first multiracial elections in South Africa, Kerzner was asked by incoming President Nelson Mandela to arrange the VIP function at the Presidential Inauguration, which was attended by approximately a thousand people, including many of the world's leaders and heads of state.\n\nIn 1996, Kerzner opened the hugely successful Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut in the United States and in 2000 opened the second phase of the project including a 1,200-room hotel through a joint venture with the Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut called Trading Cove Associates. TCA relinquished its management of the resort in 2002 but Kerzner through his company will still receive a 5% dividend on the gross revenue generated by Mohegan Sun until 2014. The property is one of the largest gambling and entertainment complexes in the United States.\n\nAs a result of the success of the Sun City resort with its Gary Player Country Club golf course (ranked number 1 in South Africa) he got involved in international hotel, leisure and gambling resorts; most notable is his role as the innovative developer behind the well-known Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas. In late 1994, Kerzner made his first major acquisition outside Africa through the purchase of the Paradise Island Resort in The Bahamas. This 1,150-room resort was in bankruptcy at the time. After acquiring the resort, Kerzner launched a major re-development and expansion program which transformed Paradise Island into a 2,300-room resort that included one of the world's largest man-made marine habitats and the Caribbean's biggest casino.\n\nIn 2002, Kerzner launched One&Only Resorts which currently operates seven properties in The Bahamas, Mexico, Mauritius, The Maldives, South Africa, Dubai and Hayman Island.\n\nIn early 2007, Kerzner expanded Atlantis, Paradise Island with new hotels The Cove and The Reef which added 1,100 new rooms to the property. This expansion was overseen by Alan Leibman, which included 21 retail outlets and new restaurants by celebrity chefs Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Nobu Matsuhisa and Bobby Flay.\nKerzner extended the Atlantis brand globally with the development of Atlantis, The Palm, Dubai, with 1,500-room, water-themed resort opened in late-September 2008 on The Palm Jumeirah – a multibillion-dollar leisure and residential development in Dubai. On September 2009, the \"Mazagan Beach Resort\" a luxury hotel in El Jadida (Morocco), has been inaugurated by Sol Kerzner him-self accompanied with many celebrities of show biz.\n\nIn October 2013, Kerzner announced that it is building a new Atlantis hotel at Sanya, Hainan Island in China with China's Fosun International. The 62-hectare resort will have 1,300 rooms and a water park like the other Atlantis hotels. The project will cost $1.63 billion.\n\nKerzner has been married four times. His first wife was Maureen Adler; they had three children: Butch Kerzner, Andrea Kerzner, and Beverly Kerzner Mace. His second wife was Shirley Bestbier; they had two children: Brandon Kerzner and Chantal Kerzner Sweeney. She later committed suicide soon after the birth of her second child. His third wife, Miss World 1974 Anneline Kriel, ended in divorce after five years. During a lengthy period in the 1990s, he dated the model Christina Estrada, got engaged, but never married her. He married his fourth wife, model Heather Murphy in 2000; they divorced in 2011.\n\nKerzner's son, Howard \"Butch\" Kerzner died on 11 October 2006 when the helicopter he was traveling in crashed near Sosua, in the Puerto Plata province of the Dominican Republic. His daughter, Andrea, is the founder and CEO of Lalela, a charity dedicated to bringing the arts to at-risk youth in South Africa.\n\n\n"}

He was involved in two political money-related scandals: Koreagate in the 1970s, and the Oil-for-Food Program scandal of the 2000s. Park had a reputation as the \"Asian Great Gatsby\".\n\nIn 1976, Park was charged with bribing members of the U.S. Congress, using money from the South Korean government, in a successful effort to convince the United States government to keep United States troops in South Korea. In 1977, he was indicted by a U.S. District Court on thirty-six counts, including bribery, illegal campaign contributions, mail fraud, racketeering, and failure to register as an agent of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. He avoided a federal trial by testifying to the court in exchange for immunity. His testimony did not have a major impact, though it led to three members of Congress getting reprimanded, and may have convinced Speaker of the House Carl Albert not to seek re-election. One of the implicated former representatives, Otto Passman of Louisiana's 5th congressional district based about Monroe, was charged with conspiracy, bribery, acceptance of an illegal gratuity, and income tax evasion. When his trial was moved from Washington, D.C., to Monroe, Passman was quickly acquitted.\nExplained William G. Hundley, a former organized crime investigator for the U.S. Senate who attended the Passman trial:\nI went there for the trial, and I'd go into restaurants with Park, and people would get up and leave. ... I thought the prosecution presented a pretty good case. But when the defense attorney, Camille Gravel, got up to cross-examine Tongsun Park, he carried a big map of Korea. He didn't even tough the merits of the case. He identified South Korea and noted that it's right under North Korea and next to China. Then he pointed out that North Korea and China are totalitarian communist states. The jury was out less than ninety minutes, and they acquitted Passman on every charge.\n\nIn 1992, Park was approached by Samir Vincent, an Iraqi-born American who was lobbying unofficially on behalf of the Saddam Hussein regime, to try to create a program that would bypass the United Nations-approved economic sanctions of Iraq that had started in 1991. Park agreed, requesting a payment of US$10 million for his effort, to which Vincent agreed. Park served as a liaison between Vincent and then-United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, with whom Park was friendly. In late 1996, partly as a result of Park's lobbying efforts, the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program began. After 1997, when Kofi Annan became the new secretary-general, the government of Iraq dropped its ties with Park; by then Park had received about US$2 million in payments.\n\nIn 2005 Park was accused of acting as an intermediary with corrupt United Nations officials in the oil-for-food conspiracy orchestrated by Saddam Hussein. His name surfaced as part of investigations into the oil-for-food scandal. In July 2006 he was convicted in a U.S. federal court on conspiracy charges. He became the first person convicted through the oil-for-food investigation. On February 22, 2007, he was sentenced to five years in prison. He also was fined $15,000 and required to forfeit $1,200,000. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons Web site, he was released from prison on September 10, 2008. The next day, he left the United States for South Korea.\n\n\n"}
