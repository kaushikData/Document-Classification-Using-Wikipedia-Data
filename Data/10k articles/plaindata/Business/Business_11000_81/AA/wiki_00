A couple of days prior to carrier departure/hotel check-in any unsold seats/rooms may be released back to the supplier if such an agreement exists between the two parties. An allotment release back period is also negotiated as part of the allotment contract (e.g. four days prior to check-in/departure).\n\nAllotments can be negotiated between a tour operator and a travel service supplier such as airline company/hotel chain, or between two travel organizers such as a tour operator and a retail travel agent. Either way the buyer needs to prove a consistent level of business, because allotments are hardly granted without any previous sales history.\n\nRooms or seats that have not been contracted between the travel company and the product supplier are handled as ‘on-request’, where each booking of an airline seat or hotel room needs to be confirmed with the supplier before being confirmed with the client.\n\nThe amount of the contracted rooms/seats to be specified in the allotment contract is a result of the estimated, during the negotiation, volume of sales to be realized by the tour operator. Tour operators book a certain number of rooms in hotels or seats on carriers and have the right to use them by a given date, also known as a release date, that usually is some days prior to tourist's arrival (hotels)/departure(carriers). The allotment contract reduces the risk of any unsold products by the supplier and grants relative price advantage to the travel organizer helping him to stay competitive on the market by offering extra discounts.\n\nTour operators obtain discounts, through allotment or commitment contracts, primarily depend on the firm size and the bargaining power exercised; they can vary from 10% to 50% according to the period of the year, the destination, the quantity and quality of services contracted upon. Some big tour operators are able to obtain up to 70% of discount.\n"}

{"id": "1249918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1249918", "title": "Anarchism and capitalism", "text": "Anarchism and capitalism\n\nAnarchism is generally defined as the political philosophy which holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful, or alternatively as opposing authority and hierarchical organization in the conduct of human relations. The nature of capitalism is a polarizing issue among anarchists. Capitalism is generally considered by scholars to be an economic system that includes private ownership of the means of production, creation of goods or services for profit or income, the accumulation of capital, competitive markets, voluntary exchange, wage labor and has generally been opposed by anarchists historically. Capitalism is variously defined by sources and there is no general consensus among scholars on the definition nor on how the term should be used as a historical category. The designation is applied to a variety of historical cases, varying in time, geography, politics and culture.\n\nMost anarchist commentators do not consider anarcho-capitalism as a legitimate form of anarchism due to perceived coercive characteristics of capitalism. In particular, they argue that certain capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion in violation of anarchist principles. Anarcho-capitalists argue that capitalism is the absence of coercion and therefore fully compatible with the philosophy of anarchism. Furthermore, they claim that an effort to put a stop to what they consider voluntary hierarchy is inconsistent with the philosophical tradition of freedom present in anarchist thought.\n\nThere is some debate about the question of private property and economic organization. Social anarchists claim that the existence of private property results in wage slavery while certain anti-capitalist individualist anarchists and mutualists argue for private property and wages owned and controlled directly by workers themselves in the form of labor-owned cooperative firms and associations. For Proudhon, \"strong workers' associations…would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis\".\n\nTraditional individualist anarchists, such as Benjamin Tucker (who identified his American individualist anarchism as \"anarchistic socialism\") are opposed to both capitalism and anarchist-communism. They support wage labor as long as the employers and employees are paid equally for equal hours worked and neither party has authority over the other (this approach was put into practice in American individualist anarchist colonies such as Utopia, which was organized by Josiah Warren). By following this principle, no individual profits from the labor of another. Tucker described the wages received in such an employer-employee relationship as the individual laborer's \"full product\". He envisioned that in such a society, every worker would be self-employed and own their own private means of production, free to walk away from employment contracts. Tucker called communist-anarchism \"pseudo-anarchism\" because it opposes wages and private property, fearing that collectivization would subdue individuals to group mentality and rob workers of the full product of their labor.\n\nThe Preamble to the Constitution of the Syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World labor union states unequivocally:Instead of the conservative motto, \"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work,\" we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, \"Abolition of the wage system.\"\n\nMany anarcho-capitalists believe that inequality is not a major concern so long as everyone has \"equality of opportunity\". Anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard argued \"the 'rightist' libertarian is not opposed to inequality\". They believe that because of a person's self-ownership, that any freedom given up in a \"laissez-faire\" marketplace would be a voluntary contract (consent) and believe there is nothing authoritarian about capitalist employer-employee relationships in such a condition: \"There is nothing authoritarian, dictatorial or exploitative in the relationship. Employees order employers to pay them amounts specified in the hiring contract just as much as employers order employees to abide by the terms of the contract\".\n\nMurray Rothbard defines equality as \"A and B are 'equal' if they are identical to each other with respect to a given attribute…There is one and only one way, then, in which any two people can really be 'equal' in the fullest sense: they must be identical in all their attributes\" and argues \"men are not uniform, [...] the species, mankind, is uniquely characterised by a high degree of variety, diversity, differentiation: in short, inequality\". This runs counter the concept of equality amongst most social and mutualist anarchists. Most anarchists would argue that freedom without equality simply gives more freedom to those who are supposedly \"superior\" and that equality without freedom is a form of oppression. Social anarchist Alexander Berkman argued:\n\nSome anarcho-capitalists, who consider themselves part of the individualist anarchist tradition, draw upon the writings of early individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner who argued that unequal wealth would not equal an unequal society. However, said anarchists believed that equality of condition, equality of access to the means of production and equal opportunity would counteract any potential tyranny in a market society. \"Spooner and Godwin insist that inequality corrupts freedom. Their anarchism is directed as much against inequality as against tyranny\" and \"[w]hile sympathetic to Spooner's individualist anarchism, they [Rothbard and David D. Friedman] fail to notice or conveniently overlook its egalitarian implications\". Tucker himself argued for a society with \"the greatest amount of liberty compatible with equality of liberty\".\n\nSome anarchists object to the portrayal of economics as a \"value-free science\": \n\nIt has also been pointed out that historically the anarchist-communist economic theories published by Peter Kropotkin and others have been ignored or intentionally sidelined by historians.\n\nWithin the realm of anarchist labor issues is the issue of the monetary system. While all anarchists are against the current monetary system, there is disagreement as to whether or not there should be a monetary system. Alexander Berkman was an anarchist against the monetary system. In his book \"What is Anarchism?\", Berkman argues that in an anarchist society money would become unnecessary. Within anarchy, all occupations are viewed as equally beneficial to society. Since the concept of value is different for everyone and cannot be determined, it is argued that it should not be set and one's contribution to society through their occupation entitled them to be a part of it. Within this system, there is a free distribution of goods without the need for money. Money in its current form is a hierarchical system, the exception being when all people are paid equal salaries. However, the argument goes further to question the purpose of money if people are paid equally. Certainly those who agree with this would also note that a monetary system would open a vulnerability for some to acquire more of it and create a class system.\n\nNot all anarchists oppose the idea of money. Individualist and mutualist anarchists see currency as a tangible form of workers receiving the \"full product of their labor\". They support mutual banking (some individualists support no banking at all to keep exchange rates constant) and local currency as opposed to national currency. Others see money as simply an index for exchanging goods and that its existence would not necessarily create a class system.\n\n\n"}

Originally organized as a co-operative in 1921, it encountered a severe decline in sugar markets and passed through a series of owners in the last half of the 20th Century. In 2017, its Crockett, California refinery processed its last shipment of Hawaiian sugar but continues to produce Pure Cane Sugar sourced from other locations. The C&H Sugar Crockett Refinery employs more than 450 people and produces 14% of the nation's cane sugar.\n\nThe California and Hawaiian Sugar Company was founded in 1906 and operated from 1921 to 1993 as an agricultural cooperative marketing association owned by the member sugar companies in Hawaii. Its headquarters are in Crockett under the Carquinez Bridge in unincorporated Contra Costa County, California.\n\nIn 1993, the member companies sold their interests in C&H to Alexander & Baldwin in Honolulu, and the refining company's status changed from a cooperative to a corporation.

He is also the President of Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo\n\nDionisio Gutierrez is the second son of Dionisio Gutierrez and Esperanza Mayorga. \n\nHis grandfather, Juan Bautista Gutierrez, was a Spaniard businessman and entrepreneur who established in Guatemala in the first years of the 20th Century. \n\nHe was one of the founders of Multi Inversiones, S. A. According to Francisco Pérez de Antón, “…for Mr. Juan Gutierrez, life had only two purposes: to work and to create a heritage for his descendants” which led him to build “one of the most solid and solvent groups in Central America”. \n\nIn the decade of the 20’s, Juan Bautista Gutierrez opened a small store in San Cristobal Totonicapan, a small town in the western region of Guatemala. \n\nIn 1936 he founded Molino Excelsior; in 1965 he started operations in the poultry industry with the Villalobos farm. In the decade of the 70’s, by initiative of his son, Dionisio Gutierrez (father) and Francisco Pérez de Antón, he started in the business of fried chicken, with what would become the most emblematic company of the then Grupo Gutierrez (today, Corporación Multi Inversiones): Pollo Campero. \n\nToday, Corporación Multi Inversiones has diversified into different industries: food, livestock, energy, finance, real estate development, telecommunications, among others, adapting to both local and international market trends.\nOn October 3, 1974, the Gutierrez family suffered a painful and sad tragedy, when the small plane bound to Honduras, filled with medicine that had been collected by the Guatemalan Rotary Club for the victims of hurricane Fifi, and piloted by Dionisio Gutierrez father and Alfonso Bosch, plummeted in the midst of San Jose Pinula, causing the death of them both.\n\nAccording to Francisco Perez de Antón, that tragedy led to a “generational void” inside the Gutierrez family, since the sons of both Dionisio Gutierrez father and this business partner Alfonso Bosch, were too young to take on management roles in the family business. This is why Dionisio Gutierrez began to work in Grupo Gutierrez since 1976, when he was only 17 years old. \n\nBesides, those years were socially and politically convulsive; violence from the local armed conflict and the consolidation of military governments, scourged practically all the Central American region.\n\nBy the end of the 70’s, Dionisio Gutierrez and his cousin Juan Luis Bosch took on a shared Chief Executive Officer role at Corporación Multi Inversiones, a family owned multinational corporation with over 45,000 employees, and presence in 14 countries in three continents. \n\nFor 33 years, Dionisio Gutierrez held the presidency role in the multinational company, founded by his grandfather in 1936. Currently, he is member of the Management Board at CMI. \n\nHe has also been Director of the Guatemalan Manager’s Association (Asociación de Gerentes de Guatemala), Director of the Trade Chamber, Director of Banco Occidente, and Vicepresident of Banco Reformador.\n\nHis foray into politics starts in the sunset of the military regime, and the beginnings of the democratic era, towards the end of the 80’s. Therefore, for almost forty years, Dionisio Gutierrez has had a permanent participation in the critical moments of the Central American region.\n\nSince his college years, Dionisio Gutierrez got involved in projects of several student associations and groups, where he denounced both the actions of the military government and the Marxist guerrilla. \n\nAmong them Electorama 82, which was an effort by young people to audit the questioned electoral process of March 7, 1982. A few weeks later, on March 23, General Efraín Ríos-Montt came to power through a coup d’état to the then president Fernando Lucas García. \n\nGutierrez also participated with the “Student Committee Against Terrorism” and the “Civil Student Front”, with several publications in the independent journal El Imparcial In 1983, when he was only 24 years old, takes on a role as a member of the board of the Guatemalan Trade Chamber.\n\nFor seven years he was president of the Free Enterprise Chamber and led one of the first programs of political surveys in the country. The first publication “Guatemala Responde 1987” (Guatemala Answers 1987) revealed Guatemalan citizen’s opinion about the economic, political and social situation in the first years of Vinicio Cerezo. \n\nLater, in 1989, he published a second edition “Guatemala Responde IV: Percepciones y opiniones del pueblo guatemalteco después de 37 meses de gobierno democrático” and in 1990, he issues a political survey about the voter’s preferences on the presidential elections of that year.\n\nThis was a TV show hosted by Dionisio Gutierrez broadcast in Guatemala, other cities in Central America and the United States during twenty years. Libre Encuentro encouraged thought and debate among leaders from different sectors of the society, and became a referent for the public opinion in Guatemala, where he reached record rating levels. In his emissions, Gutierrez stirred debate and controversy among guests from all social sectors and experts. In many occasions even abandoning his role as moderator, and participating in the arguments.\n\nSix days after the rupture of the constitutional order perpetrated on Tuesday, May 25, 1993, by Jorge Antonio Serrano Elías, in which he tried to dissolve the Congress, dismiss the Supreme Court of Justice, the Constitutional Court and the Human Rights Delegate. \n\nSeveral Guatemalan civil citizens, among whom was Dionisio Gutiérrez, issued a declaration \"Given the political crisis the country is undergoing\", better known as the document of \"Los Abajo Firmantes\", where they rejected the violations of the Constitution by Serrano Elías, calling him \"dictator\" and demanding his irrevocable resignation as well as the restitution of the Public Powers of the republic. \n\nIn addition to this document, Gutiérrez, along with other actors of civil society, organized citizen protests, marches and rallies in front of the National Palace, through a platform called the National Consensus Instance.\n\nIn early 2003, then president Alfonso Portillo attacks media calling them “clowns”, and stated they were “at the service of obscure interests” and referred to Dionisio Gutierrez as “the circus owner”. Dionisio Gutierrez issued an answer stating that “the government called conspirator and subversive to any person who speaks the truth about the President”.\n\nOn July 24, 2003, in the streets of several zones of Guatemala City, the General and former President Efraín Ríos-Montt, in an action that has been described as a \"populist ruse\", demanded that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal register him as a presidential candidate, despite being banned for having led a coup d'état. \n\nA few days before the event, on July 14 of that year, the Constitutional Court issued a decision denying the petition. For this reason, on Monday, July 21, the General indirectly led his followers to rebellion, and warned that he would not be held responsible if the protests got out of control.\n\nOn July 24, several people took different points of the city, and one of the most threatened places was the Centro Empresarial building, where the corporate offices of Multi Inversiones is located. One of the most fierce opponents of the inscription of Ríos Montt was Dionisio Gutierrez. According to Prensa Libre: “That day, the lives of hundreds of employees in that building was put at risk, because several tires were set on fire, which made the air unbreathable, and the mob threatened to burn the building”.After being besieged for twelve hours, 900 people who had been trapped in the Centro Empresarial building were rescued and the protesters withdrew. The damage to property, life and production was invaluable.\n\nOn Thursday, July 1, 2010, the government of then President Álvaro Colom denounced a \"destabilization plan composed of attacks on security forces and reports in some media outlets\" in the public complaint, the president accused Dionisio Gutiérrez as one of the responsible for that plan. In response, the businessman said \"With all due respect, I ask you not to fall into the totalitarian trap\".\n\nMonths later, Dionisio Gutiérrez started one of the most controversial episodes of 2010 due to a comment against President Álvaro Colom and his wife Sandra Torres at the National Entrepreneurs Conference. After the incident, Dionisio Gutierrez ended up taking distance from the “Libre Encuentro\" program and the country, alleging, among other reasons, the \"evident increase in forms of harassment and intimidation, even constant death threats\" against him.\n\nIn 2012, already back in Guatemala City, Dionisio Gutiérrez created the Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo (Freedom and Development Foundation), which is an independent, private and proactive think tank dedicated to the study and analysis of social, economic and political issues to promote values and principles of a free society. As president of the Foundation, Gutiérrez leads a team of intellectuals with whom he works in multiple civic activities and develops the articulation of long-term state proposals for Central America.\n\nOn January 27, 2013 was born the television show \"Dimension\", sponsored by the Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo, which was broadcast weekly on Canal 3, under the direction of Dionisio Gutiérrez until August 2018. The show dealt with social issues and tried to promote participation \"to generate reflection on the complex problems that afflict Guatemalan and Central American societies”.\n\nIn August 2015, following the announcement of the participation of Vice President Roxana Baldetti and President of the Republic Otto Pérez Molina in a structure dedicated to customs fraud in Guatemala known as La Línea, Dionisio Gutiérrez asks the resignation of the then President Otto Pérez Molina in a Public Letter from the Libertad y Desarrollo Foundation. \n\nIn an interview in a local media outlet, Dionisio Gutiérrez said about Otto Pérez Molina:“An individual I met in the Serranazo days, and with whom I no longer had a significant contact until the end of 2010, when he was the most persecuted opposition politician, and I was the most persecuted civil citizen by the government of the UNE party. And four months after he was appointed President, I denounced his would be another government taking Guatemala towards lost paths”. \n\nIn September 2016, through the Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo, Dionisio Gutierrez opened the first Encuentros Ciudadano (Citizen Encounters) with a speech focused on inequality in the country. Since then, these meetings have become an annual experience that is replicated in other cities in Guatemala, where key personalities from different sectors of the society get together to discuss about different topics of national interest. In April 2017, the second Encuentro Ciudadano was held, in which the country reality was analyzed, with emphasis in politics, inequality and underdevelopment. \n\nOn March 7, 2018, the main topic on the third Encuentro Ciudadano focused on the importance of the fight against corruption in Guatemala. Then Attorney General Thelma Aldana and the Chief of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), Iván Velásquez were invited as panelists, the latter participated through a pre-recorded interview. In his keynote, Gutierrez said that president Jimmy Morales had not been invited and encouraged him to “\"stop shaming Guatemala\"” and to “\"stop representing the obscure forces that don’t want the country to change. Your actions contradict your words\"”. \n\nIn late February 2018, Gutierrez makes a public appearance, in the days of the formation of the Frente Ciudadano Contra la Corrupción (Citizen Front Against Corruption), formed by businessmen, activists, Mayan authorities, communicators and several personalities from the society, who manifested their commitment in the fight against corruption and impunity in Guatemala, and also their commitment to support the permanence of Iván Velásquez as Chief of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), and the work of Thelma Aldana as Attorney General of the Ministerio Público. The role of Gutierrez at the front of the fight against corruption has earned him several criticism from different sectors.\n\nOn April 30, 2018, given the smear campaign against CICIG and the lobby that was being made in Washington against the Commission, Dionisio Gutierrez sent a letter to twelve Senators and Congressmen of the United States, about the importance of the permanence of CICIG in Guatemala. In that letter, Gutierrez lists a number of prosecuted officials by the Guatemalan justice due to corruption. He also stated that CICIG “has demonstrated its ability to bring justice to Guatemala, and for the first time in recent history, let Guatemalans have trust and faith in their government institutions. \n\nOn September 19, 2018, after three years away from the television, Dionisio Gutierrez makes a comeback to the screen with the show “Razón de Estado”, broadcast through Guatevisión channel, on Wednesdays at 9:30 PM. According to the show’s website, “it is a tribune for debate and reflection, engaged with freedom, democracy, and rule of law”.\n\nSeveral content formats are used in this show: documentaries, interviews, discussion panels, and coverages.\n\nIn 2012, the Power Awards and the American Business Council Foundation of the United States recognized the efforts and trajectory of Gutiérrez by bestowing upon him the award “Empowering Democracy\".\n\nIn 2014, His Majesty, King Felipe VI of Spain, awarded him the high honor of the Order of Civil Merit in Commendation to Gutiérrez.\n\nHe is also a founder and trustee of the School of Government in Guatemala, an educational entity whose mission is to transform the way government and politics are conducted in Guatemala.\n"}

The area features many of the city's major arts institutions and sports facilities.\n\nThe east-west grid of downtown Yangon was laid out by British military engineers Alexander Fraser and Montgomerie after the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1852. The city was later developed by the Public Works Department and Bengal Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe majority of sites on the Yangon City Heritage List are located in Yangon's CBD.\n\nYangon's CBD is known for its leafy avenues and fin-de-siècle architecture. The former British colonial capital has the highest number of colonial period buildings in Southeast Asia. The CBD is still mainly made up of decaying colonial buildings. The former High Court, the former Secretariat buildings, the former St. Paul's English High School and the Strand Hotel are excellent examples of the bygone era. Most buildings in the CBD from this era are four-story mix-use (residential and commercial) buildings with ceilings, allowing for the construction of mezzanines. Despite their less-than-perfect conditions, the buildings remain highly sought after and most expensive in the city's property market.\n\nIn 1996, the Yangon City Development Committee created a Yangon City Heritage List of old buildings and structures in the city that cannot be modified or torn down without approval. In 2012, the city of Yangon imposed a 50-year moratorium on demolition of buildings older than 50 years. The Yangon Heritage Trust, an NGO started by Thant Myint-U, aims to create heritage areas in Downtown, and attract investors to renovate buildings for commercial use.\n\nGeographically, the CBD is bounded by the Pun Hlaing River to the west, the Hlaing River to the south and Pazundaung Creek to the east.\n\nThe pattern of south to north roads is as follows: one broad wide broad road, two narrow streets, one mid-size street, two more narrow streets, and then another wide broad road. This order is repeated from west to east. The narrow streets are numbered; the medium and broad roads are named.\n\nFor instance, the Lanmadaw Road is followed by -wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium Sint-Oh-Dan Road, the 30-foot 19th and 20th streets, followed by another wide Latha Road, followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets, and so on.\n\nThe roads running parallel west to east were the Strand Road, Merchant Road, Maha Bandula (née Dalhousie) Road, Anawrahta (Fraser) Road, and Bogyoke Aung San (Montgomerie) Road.\n\nThe CBD's road layout follows a grid pattern, based on four types of roads:\n\nSince February 2010, pickup truck bus lines have been forbidden to run in 6 townships of the CBD, namely Latha, Lanmadaw, Pabedan, Kyauktada, Botahtaung and Pazundaung Townships. In May 2003, a ban on using car horns was implemented in six townships of The CBD to reduce noise pollution. In April 2004, the car horn ban was expanded to cover the entire city.\n"}

Zóbel and EZ, was a prominent Filipino businessman and polo player.\n\nThe only child of Col. Jacobo Zóbel y Roxas and Ángela Olgado, he was a grandson and namesake of Enrique Zóbel de Ayala.\n\nAfter the Japanese forces entered Manila in 1941, the 14-year-old Enrique displayed his resourcefulness and audacity, having to care for his mother while his father was with the USAFFE forces in Bataan. To generate income for their daily needs, he used his father's polo ponies to offer kalesa rides and even befriended General Ota, the head of the Kempeitai in the process.\n\nHe became the favorite of his aunt, Doña Mercedes Zobel McMicking (matriarch of the Zóbel de Ayala family after the deaths of her brothers, Jacobo and Alfonso), and her husband, Col. Joseph McMicking. The couple took interest in his education and growth and groomed him, together with other clan members for the family businesses.\n\nZóbel joined Ayala y Compañia in 1955 and worked closely with his uncle, Col. McMicking, who was credited for engineering the transformation of Makati from vast tracts of swamplands into the Philippines' premier financial and commercial district. When the Ayala y Compañia partnership became a corporation in 1967 (after the retirement of Col. McMicking), Zóbel became its first chief executive. Like McMicking, Zóbel showed great strength and business savvy in contributing to the growth of Ayala as one of the Philippines' biggest and most respected conglomerates. He sustained McMicking’s vision for the Ayala group. He professionalized the Ayala group and was instrumental in fulfilling Ayala’s goal to become a major player in the banking sector, as the company gained control of the Bank of the Philippine Islands. Ayala also moved into new industries - semiconductor (Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc.), food processing (Pure Foods Corporation - now, San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc.), agribusiness (Ayala Agricultural Development Corporation) and telecommunications (Globe-Mackay Cable & Radio Corporation - now, Globe Telecom). In 1973, Zóbel welcomed the Mitsubishi group as partners and took Ayala Corporation public in 1976. On November 8, 1976, Ayala Corporation was listed in the Makati Stock Exchange (now Philippine Stock Exchange).\n\nIn 1981, he founded the Makati Business Club (MBC) to support or oppose policies which affected national life. He felt that the business community needed to speak out as a single solid voice and not lobby for its own corporate or sectoral interest. From 1983 to 1986, MBC would be the prime advocate of political change.\n\nIn 1983, he fought with his third cousin Andrés Soriano, Jr. for control of San Miguel Corporation (SMC). After losing the battle for control, he sold the Zóbel de Ayala family's shares (equivalent to 19% of SMC) in SMC to Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. His controversial move was met with the displeasure of his aunt, Doña Mercedes, and cost him his position at Ayala. He was succeeded by his first cousin Jaime Zóbel de Ayala in 1984.\n\nOn his own, he took on projects of unprecedented dimensions in 1984, building the Istana Nurul Iman (official residence of the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah) at a total cost of around $1.4 Billion USD under his company, Ayala International, Inc.\n\nThe De La Salle-Santiago Zóbel School located in Ayala Alabang Village (an Ayala real estate development) was named in memory of son, Jacobo Santiago \"Santi\" (1954-1965), who died of pneumonia at the age of 11.\n\nIn 1990, he established the Enrique Zóbel Foundation, which focuses on social and economic development projects in Calatagan, Batangas.\n\nOn May 10, 1991, Zóbel suffered a spinal injury and was paralyzed from the waist down after an accident in Sotogrande, Spain while playing polo. He had to stop all physical activities and instead devoted his time to his foundation.\n\nHe was a recipient of the TOFIL Award in 2001.\n\nHe was a consummate pilot and was equally at home with jets and propeller airplanes. Even just before his death, he was looking for a small jet that could fly the distance from Manila to Hawaii, where he had a vacation home.\n\nHe was first married to Rocio Urquijo with whom he had three children - Jacobo Santiago \"Santi\" (1954-1965), Mercedes and Iñigo. He later separated from Urquijo and married Dee Anne Hora, an American. After his death, Hora became the chairwoman of the Enrique Zobel Foundation and continues his good works.\n\nHe was also known by his employees as a fluent Tagalog speaker with a twist of Batangueno accent given his sojourn in Batangas. \n\nZóbel died on May 17, 2004 at the age of 77.\n\nZóbel was an avid polo player and was the first Filipino president of Manila Polo Club (1963-1964). In honor of his memory, the East Polo Field of the club was renamed Enrique Zóbel Field on January 9, 2005. The Enrique Zóbel Memorial Polo Cup was launched on January 30, 2005 at the club and has been held annually since.\n\n\n"}

Williams explain the concept:\n\n\"The problem with mature companies is that the very commercial success of their products increases their dependency on them. Making radical changes in the product's capabilities, underlying architecture or associated business models could cannibalize sales or lead to costly realignments of strategy and business infrastructure. It's as though popular and widely adopted products become ossified, hardened by the inherent incentives to build on their own success.

(\"Ford Automotive Industry\") is an automotive manufacturing company based in Turkey that is equally owned by Ford Motor Company and Koç Holding. It was established in its current form in 1977, with original relations dating back to 1928. It currently operates five facilities throughout the country, and is headquartered in Gölcük, with a second location in İnönü.\n\nThe collaboration began in 1928, when Vehbi Koç was assigned as Ford dealer in Ankara. The following year, the Turkish national assembly granted to Ford the right to install a local assembly operation in a free zone located in Istanbul's port area. Limited numbers of vehicles were assembled there until 1934, when these activities were suspended.\n\nIn 1959, the foundation of the Otosan factory was held in Istanbul, and in 1960 the Ford Consul was the first model to be produced at the plant, followed by the Thames and the Thames Trader van. In 1965, the D1210 truck was added to production, and in 1966, the Anadol, the first mass-production passenger vehicle developed in Turkey. In 1967, the Ford Transit also began production and in 1973, the Anadol STC-16, the first sports car developed in Turkey.\n\nIn 1977, the company signed a license agreement with Ford and the company's name was changed to Ford Otosan. In 1979, took place the groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory in İnönü, Eskişehir, which began production of the Ford Cargo in 1983. Also that year, Ford increased its share of ownership in the company to 30 percent. In 1985, the Ford Taunus begins production at the Istanbul plant, and in 1986 the official opening ceremony for the İnönü engine plant is held.\n\nIn 1992, the newer Ford Transit was put into production, and in 1993 the Ford Escort replaced the Ford Taunus on the production lines. In 1997, Ford further increased its share in the company to 41 percent, becoming equal partner with Koç Holding in the joint venture. In 1998, the groundbreaking ceremony was held for the new factory in Gölcük, Kocaeli, that became operational in 2001, replacing the Istanbul facility. It is aimed mainly at commercial vehicle production, and manufactures the Ford Transit and the Ford Transit Connect, both models being marketed worldwide. In 2003, the company launched a new generation of the Ford Cargo heavy-duty truck.\n\nIn September 2012, Ford revealed its new version of the Transit, and in January 2013 the new Cargo heavy truck was unveiled. The latter was co-developed by Ford Otosan in partnership with \nFord Brazil, and will be manufactured in both countries.\n\nIn September 2018, at the IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hannover, Germany, Ford introduced an electric tractor trailer concept vehicle dubbed the F-Vision, which would have Level 4 autonomous driving capability.\n\nThe company operates five facilities throughout the country. The Kocaeli Plant, located in Gölcük, was opened in 2001, and has been the main global production center for the Transit and the Transit Connect. It has an annual production capacity of 320,000 vehicles and has its own port.\n\nThe İnönü Plant, located in Eskişehir, began operating in 1982, and has been the production center of the Cargo heavy truck, as well as for engines and powertrains. It has an annual capacity of 10,000 trucks, 66,000 engines and 45,000 gearboxes.\n\nThe Kartal Parts Distribution Center, located in the Sancaktepe district of Istanbul, has been operating since 1998, and it is the marketing centre of the company's marketing, sales, after-sales and spare parts operations.\n\nThe Sancaktepe Engineering Center, located in the Sancaktepe district of Istanbul, was established in 2014, and is responsible for the development of the newest products and technologies. It employs over 1000 product development engineers.\n\nThe Yeniköy plant started production of the Transit/Tourneo Courier in the second quarter of 2014.

In 1951 he became assisting chief executive, and from 1959 to 1971 he served as the chief executive of Elkem. He succeeded Alf Monrad-Aas. During his time the company established, or participated in establishing, Grong Gruber, Salten Verk, Mosjøen Aluminiumsverk and Lista Aluminiumsverk. Fiskaa Verk was expanded, and the ownership in Sulitjelma Gruber and Porsgrunn Elektrometallurgiske increased.

He is widely known for his sports writing and for helping to found \"The Paris Review\", as well as his patrician demeanor and accent. He was also famous for \"participatory journalism\" which included competing in professional sporting events, acting in a Western, performing a comedy act at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and playing with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and then recording the experience from the point of view of an amateur.\n\nPlimpton was born in New York City on March 18, 1927, and spent his childhood there, attending St. Bernard's School and growing up in an apartment duplex on Manhattan's Upper East Side located at 1165 Fifth Avenue. During the summers, he lived in the hamlet of West Hills, Huntington, Suffolk County on Long Island.\n\nHe was the son of Francis T. P. Plimpton, and the grandson of Frances Taylor Pearsons and George Arthur Plimpton. His grandfather was the founder of the Ginn publishing company and a philanthropist. His father was a successful corporate lawyer and partner of the law firm Debevoise and Plimpton who was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as U.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations, serving from 1961 to 1965.\n\nHis mother was Pauline Ames, the daughter of botanist Oakes Ames and artist Blanche Ames. Both of Plimpton's maternal grandparents were born with the surname Ames; his mother was the granddaughter of Medal of Honor recipient Adelbert Ames (1835-1933), an American sailor, soldier, and politician, and Oliver Ames, a US political figure and the 35th Governor of Massachusetts (1887–1890). She was also the great-granddaughter on her father's side of Oakes Ames (1804–1873), an industrialist and congressman who was implicated in the Crédit Mobilier railroad scandal of 1872; and Governor-General of New Orleans Benjamin Franklin Butler, an American lawyer and politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives and later served as the 33rd Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nGeorge had three siblings: Francis Taylor Pearsons Plimpton Jr., Oakes Ames Plimpton, and Sarah Gay Plimpton.\n\nPlimpton attended St. Bernard's School, Phillips Exeter Academy (from which he was expelled just shy of graduation), and Daytona Beach Mainland High School, where he received his high school diploma before entering Harvard College in July 1944. He wrote for the \"Harvard Lampoon\", was a member of the Hasty Pudding Club, Pi Eta, the Signet Society, and the Porcellian Club. He majored in English. Plimpton entered Harvard as a member of the Class of 1948, but did not graduate until 1950 due to intervening military service. He was also an accomplished birdwatcher.\n\nPlimpton's studies were interrupted by military service lasting from 1945 to 1948, during which he served as a tank driver in Italy for the U.S. Army. After graduating from Harvard, he attended King's College at Cambridge University in England. He studied there from 1950 to 1952 and graduated with third class honors, BA in English.\n\nIn 1953, Plimpton joined the influential literary journal \"The Paris Review\", founded by Peter Matthiessen, Thomas H. Guinzburg, and Harold L. \"Doc\" Humes, becoming its first editor in chief. This periodical has carried great weight in the literary world, but has never been financially strong; for its first half-century, it was allegedly largely financed by its publishers and by Plimpton. Two articles by Richard Cummings, \"An American in Paris\" (\"The American Conservative\") and \"The Fiction of the State\" (\"Lobster\"), disclosed that the CIA provided funds for \"The Paris Review\", using publisher Sadruddin Aga Khan's foundation as a conduit, and that Plimpton was an \"agent of influence\" for the CIA. Peter Matthiessen took the magazine over from Humes and ousted him as editor, replacing him with Plimpton, using it as his cover for his CIA activities. Jean Stein became his co-editor. Plimpton was associated with the literary magazine in Paris, \"Merlin\", which folded because the State Department withdrew its support. Future Poet Laureate Donald Hall, who had met Plimpton at Exeter, was Poetry Editor. One of the magazine's most notable discoveries was author and screenplay writer Terry Southern, who was living in Paris at the time and formed a lifelong friendship with Plimpton, along with writer Alexander Trocchi and future classical and jazz pioneer David Amram.\n\nOutside the literary world, Plimpton was famous for competing in professional sporting events and then recording the experience from the point of view of an amateur. In 1958, prior to a post-season exhibition game at Yankee Stadium between teams managed by Willie Mays (National League) and Mickey Mantle (American League), Plimpton pitched against the National League. His experience was captured in the book \"Out of My League\". (He intended to face both line-ups, but tired badly and was relieved by Ralph Houk.) Plimpton sparred for three rounds with boxing greats Archie Moore and Sugar Ray Robinson, while on assignment for \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nIn 1963, Plimpton attended preseason training with the Detroit Lions of the National Football League as a backup quarterback, and ran a few plays in an intrasquad scrimmage. These events were recalled in his best-known book \"Paper Lion\", which was later adapted into a feature film starring Alan Alda, released in 1968. Plimpton revisited pro football in 1971, this time joining the Baltimore Colts and seeing action in an exhibition game against his previous team, the Lions. These experiences served as the basis of another football book, \"Mad Ducks and Bears\", although much of the book dealt with the off-field escapades of football friends such as Alex Karras and Bobby Layne. Another sports book, \"Open Net\", saw him train as an ice hockey goalie with the Boston Bruins, even playing part of a National Hockey League preseason game.\n\nPlimpton's \"The Bogey Man\" chronicles his attempt to play professional golf on the PGA Tour during the Nicklaus and Palmer era of the 1960s. Among other challenges for \"Sports Illustrated\", he attempted to play top-level bridge, and spent some time as a high-wire circus performer. Some of these events, such as his stint with the Colts, and an attempt at stand-up comedy, were presented on the ABC television network as a series of specials.\n\nIn 1994 Plimpton appeared several times in the Ken Burns series \"Baseball\" where he shared some personal baseball experiences as well as other memorable events throughout the history of baseball.\n\nIn the April 1, 1985 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", Plimpton pulled off one of the greatest April Fools' Day pranks of all time. With the help of the New York Mets organization and several Mets players, Plimpton wrote a convincing account of a new unknown pitcher in the Mets spring training camp named Siddhartha Finch who threw a baseball over 160 mph, wore a heavy boot on one foot, and was a practicing Buddhist with a largely unknown background. The prank was so successful that many readers believed the story, and the ensuing popularity of the joke resulted in Plimpton writing an entire book on Finch.\n\nA personal friend of the New England Sedgwick family, Plimpton edited \"Edie: An American Biography\" with Jean Stein in 1982. He also appeared in a brief interview footage about Edie Sedgwick in the DVD extra for the film \"Ciao! Manhattan\". In addition, he appeared in the PBS \"American Masters\" documentary on Andy Warhol. Plimpton also appeared in the closing credits of the 2006 film, \"Factory Girl\".\n\nBetween 2000 and 2003, Plimpton wrote the libretto to a new opera Animal Tales, commissioned by Family Opera Initiative, with music by Kitty Brazelton directed by Grethe Barrett Holby. He wrote, \"I suppose in a mild way there is a lesson to be learned for the young, or the young at heart – the gumption to get out and try one's wings.\"\n\nPlimpton also appeared in a number of feature films as an extra and in cameo appearances. He had a small role in the Oscar-winning film \"Good Will Hunting\", playing a psychologist. Plimpton played Tom Hanks's antagonistic father in \"Volunteers\". He was also notable for his appearance in television commercials during the early 1980s, including a memorable campaign for Mattel's Intellivision. In this campaign, Plimpton aggressively touted the superiority of Intellivision video games over those of competitors such as the Atari 2600.\n\nHe hosted Disney Channel's \"Mouseterpiece Theater\" (a \"Masterpiece Theatre\" spoof which featured Disney cartoon shorts). In the \"I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can\" episode of \"The Simpsons\", he hosts the \"Spellympics\" and attempts to bribe Lisa Simpson to lose with the offer of a scholarship at a Seven Sisters College and a hot plate; \"it's perfect for soup!\" He had a recurring role as the grandfather of Dr. Carter on the long-running NBC series \"ER\". He also appeared in an episode of the NBC sitcom \"Wings\".\n\nPlimpton appeared in the 1989 documentary \"The Tightrope Dancer\" which featured the life and the work of the artist Vali Myers. He was one of her original supporters and had published an article about her work in \"The Paris Review\". He also appeared in the 1996 documentary \"When We Were Kings\" about the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" 1974 Ali-Foreman Championship fight opposite Norman Mailer crediting Muhammad Ali as a poet who composed the world's shortest poem: \"Me? Whee!!\"\n\nPlimpton was a member of the cast of the A&E TV series \"A Nero Wolfe Mystery\" (2001–02). In 2013, the documentary \"Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself\", directed by Tom Bean and Luke Poling, was released. The film used archival audio and video of Plimpton lecturing and reading to create a posthumous narration.\n\nPlimpton was a demolitions expert in the post-World War II Army. After returning to New York from Paris, he routinely fired off fireworks at his evening parties.\n\nHis enthusiasm for fireworks grew, and he was appointed Fireworks Commissioner of New York by Mayor John Lindsay, an unofficial post he held until his death.\n\nIn 1975, in Bellport, Long Island, Plimpton attempted to break the record for the world's largest firework. His firework, a Roman candle named \"Fat Man\", weighed and was expected to rise to or more and deliver a wide starburst. When lit, the firework remained on the ground and exploded, blasting a crater wide and deep. A later attempt, fired at Cape Canaveral, rose approximately into the air and broke 700 windows in Titusville, Florida.\n\nWith Felix Grucci, Plimpton competed in the 16th International Fireworks Festival in 1979 in Monte Carlo. After several problems with transporting and preparing the fireworks, Plimpton and Grucci became the first competitors from the United States to win the event. Plimpton later wrote the book \"Fireworks\", and hosted an A&E Home Video with the same name featuring his many fireworks adventures with the Gruccis of New York in Monte Carlo and for the 1983 Brooklyn Bridge Centennial.\n\nA November 6, 1971, cartoon in \"The New Yorker\" by Whitney Darrow Jr. shows a cleaning lady on her hands and knees scrubbing an office floor while saying to another one: \"I'd like to see George Plimpton do \"this\" sometime.\" In another cartoon in \"The New Yorker\", a patient looks up at the masked surgeon about to operate on him and asks, \"Wait a minute! How do I know you're not George Plimpton?\" A feature in \"Mad Magazine\" titled \"Some Really Dangerous Jobs for George Plimpton\" spotlighted him trying to swim across Lake Erie, strolling through New York's Times Square in the middle of the night, and spending a week with Jerry Lewis.\n\nPlimpton was married twice. His first wife, whom he married in 1968 and divorced in 1988, was Freddy Medora Espy, a photographer's assistant. She was the daughter of writers Willard R. Espy and Hilda S. Cole, who had, earlier in her career, been a publicity agent for Kate Smith and Fred Waring. They had two children: Medora Ames Plimpton and Taylor Ames Plimpton, who has published a memoir entitled \"Notes from the Night: A Life After Dark\".\n\nIn 1992, he married Sarah Whitehead Dudley, a graduate of Columbia University and a freelance writer. She is the daughter of James Chittenden Dudley, a managing partner of Manhattan-based investment firm Dudley and Company, and geologist Elisabeth Claypool. James and Elisabeth established the Highstead Arboretum in Redding, Connecticut. George and Sarah were the parents of twin daughters Laura Dudley Plimpton and Olivia Hartley Plimpton.\n\nAt Harvard, Plimpton was a classmate and close personal friend of Robert Kennedy. Plimpton, along with former decathlete Rafer Johnson and American football star Rosey Grier, was credited with helping wrestle Sirhan Sirhan to the floor when Kennedy was assassinated following his victory in the 1968 California Democratic primary at the former Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.\n\nPlimpton died on September 25, 2003, in his New York City apartment from an apparent heart attack. He was 76.\n\nAn oral biography titled \"George, Being George\" was edited by Nelson W. Aldrich Jr., and released on October 21, 2008. The book offers memories of Plimpton from among other writers, such as Norman Mailer, William Styron, Gay Talese and Gore Vidal, and was written with the cooperation of both his ex-wife and his widow.\n\nIn the movie \"Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton As Himself\", the writer James Salter said of Plimpton that \"he was writing in a genre that really doesn't permit greatness.\"\n\nIn 2006, the musician Jonathan Coulton wrote the song entitled \"A Talk with George\", a part of his 'Thing A Week' series, in tribute to Plimpton's many adventures and approach to life.\n\nPlimpton is the protagonist of the semi-fictional \"George Plimpton's Video Falconry\", a 1983 ColecoVision game postulated by humorist John Hodgman and recreated by video game auteur Tom Fulp.\n\nResearcher and writer Samuel Arbesman filed with NASA to name an asteroid after Plimpton; NASA issued the certificate 7932 Plimpton in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1811, at the age of 18, he enlisted in the army of Napoleon. Promoted to \"Maréchal des logis\" in 1813, after several campaigns he deserted and returned to Luxembourg in 1814.\n\nHe then entered the world of business and took to selling tobacco like his father and grandfather. Together with his brother Antoine, he was the director from 1814 to 1816 and then again from 1822 to 1844 of the tobacco factory in the Fishmarket neighbourhood which had been founded by their grandfather Jules Joseph Antoine Pescatore.\n\nIn 1816 he married Marguerite Beving, and settled with her in Luxembourg City. She died of illness, and without children, in June 1821.\n\nIn 1837 Pescatore met the Swiss Anne-Cathérine Weber, with whom he lived together and whom he married in 1851 in the church (but not civilly), in order to render this relation acceptable to the public. Due to this confusion there were arguments after his death about the inheritance.\n\nIn 1817 he received long-term permission from the French authorities to import Havana tobacco to France. Pescatore's good relations with the \"Régie française des tabacs\", the Belgian annexation of the French-speaking part of Luxembourg in 1839, and Luxembourg's accession to the Zollverein (the German customs union), exposing Luxembourgish tobacco manufacturing to strong competition from abroad, were damaging to Pescatore's business interests in the Grand-Duchy. He therefore established himself in Paris, in order to concentrate solely on the French markets, and would become a naturalised French citizen on 3 September 1846. In addition to trading in tobacco, he also dabbled in finance, founding the bank \"J.P. Pescatore et Cie\" on 27 December 1844 with the Austrian Frédéric Adolphe Grieninger.\n\nOn 11 August 1844 he bought the Château de la Celle Saint-Cloud from the Viscount de Morel-Vindé's heirs. In 1849 he also bought a vineyard at Médoc, near Giscours. In 1852 he became mayor of La Celle-Saint-Cloud, which he remained until his death.\n\nJean-Pierre Pescatore had various hobbies, including collecting works of art, rare plant specimens and breeding horses. He acquired paintings and drawings from prestigious backgrounds, such as the galleries of the King of the Netherlands and of Louis Philippe I. He amassed more than 800 plant specimens, including a collection of the first orchids in France, with the help of Jean Linden. The latter named a publication with orchids from his collection, \"Pescatorea. \"Empress Eugénie, and her husband Napoleon III, came to see the collection twice. Pescatore renovated his château to house his fragile plants, constructing an orangery and three greenhouses. He became president of the horticultural society of Seine-et-Oise and of the floral society of Versailles. A recipient of the Légion d'honneur, in 1852 he was also appointed Consul-General of the Netherlands. He died on 9 December 1855 at his Paris house, and was buried in La Celle-Saint-Cloud. He left the considerable sum of 10 millions francs. Without a direct heir, his inheritance was the subject of a dispute between his partner, Anne Catherine Weber, and his other heirs.\n\nFinally, the Château de La Celle was awarded to his niece, Elisabeth (Lily) Dutreux-Pescatore, with usufruct for life to Anne Catherine Weber. The heirs of Pescatore-Dutreux owned the château until 1951.\n\nIn 1940, Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg stopped at the Château de la Celle Saint-Cloud for a few days, while fleeing the German invasion of Luxembourg. The Germans then occupied the castle until August 1944. After the liberation of France, Auguste Dutreux regained his property. He donated the castle and its gardens, to the French Foreign Ministry on 7 February 1951, which still owns it today.\n\nIn 1853 he donated half a million francs to Luxembourg City, in order to build an old people's home, the later \"Fondation Pescatore\", opened in 1892. The city also received his art collection, housed in the Musée Jean-Pierre Pescatore, on the first floor of the town hall. In 1953 it was moved to the Villa Vauban.\n\nIn 2005 the Luxembourgish postal service put out a stamp commemorating his philanthropy in the Grand Duchy. Two streets are also named after him, one in La Celle Saint-Cloud and one in Luxembourg.\n\n\n"}

His mother, Julia Gardiner Tyler, eventually allowed him to join the Confederate States Navy because it had a lesser casualty rate than the Confederate Army. However, Tyler spent most of his time on a ship quarantined due to yellow fever and left naval service in 1864. After attending college for three months, he left and joined the First Virginia Battalion of Artillery under General Robert E. Lee, just prior to Lee's surrender at Appomattox, which effectively ended the war.\n\nIn 1865, he and his brother, David Gardiner Tyler, traveled to Germany to attend college, where he studied in Carlsruhe, Baden and Freiberg, Saxony to become a mining engineer. Still in Germany in 1870 at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Tyler enlisted in the Prussian Army and joined the First Uhlan regiment under the command of King John of Saxony. He served with distinction in the occupation of France in 1871.\n\nIn 1873, Tyler returned to the United States and attempted to find work as a mining engineer near Salt Lake City, but was unable to find a position, probably due to the Depression of 1873–79. Although he did find a job with a railroad, the salary did not allow him to meet his debts, and he had financial problems until he married a wealthier third cousin, Sarah Griswold Gardiner, on August 5, 1875. President Rutherford B. Hayes later appointed him as a surveyor for the United States Department of the Interior. In 1883, at 35 years old, Tyler died of a fever while working as a mining engineer in New Mexico.\n\n"}

A Republican, Heinz served in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977, and in the United States Senate from 1977 until he was killed in a plane crash in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania, in 1991.\n\nHenry John Heinz III was born on October 23, 1938, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Joan (Diehl) and H. J. Heinz II, heir to the H. J. Heinz Company. An only child, Heinz moved to San Francisco, California, with his mother and stepfather, U.S. Navy Captain Clayton Chot \"Monty\" McCauley following his parents' divorce in 1942. Although he was raised and primarily resided in San Francisco throughout his childhood, Heinz often spent the summer months with his father in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn 1956, Heinz graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy. He then attended and graduated from Yale University in 1960, majoring in History, Arts and Letters, and subsequently graduated from Harvard Business School in 1963. It was during his years at Harvard, during summer break, that he met his future wife, Teresa Simões Ferreira, who attended the University of Geneva. Upon graduating from Harvard Business School in 1963, Heinz served in the United States Air Force Reserve and was on active duty during the same year. He remained in the Air Force Reserve until 1969.\n\nBefore entering politics, Heinz served as an assistant to Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Senator Hugh Scott and played an active role as assistant campaign manager during Scott's campaign for re-election. Heinz then worked in the financial and marketing division of the H. J. Heinz Company between 1965 and 1970, after which he became a professor of business at the Carnegie Mellon University's Graduate School of Industrial Administration.\n\nIn 1971, Heinz entered politics after Representative Robert Corbett, who represented Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, died in office. After winning the Republican primary, Heinz won the special election on November 2, 1971, to fill the vacancy created by Corbett's death. Heinz was re-elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972 and 1974.\n\nHeinz opted not to run for re-election to his seat in the House of Representatives, choosing instead in 1976 to run for Pennsylvania's open United States Senate seat created by the retirement of incumbent Hugh Scott. Heinz won the election, and was subsequently re-elected in 1982 and in 1988.\n\nIn the Senate, Heinz was a moderate-to-liberal Republican. He was a member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Finance, the National Commission on Social Security Reform, the National Commission on Health Care Reform, the Northeast Coalition, and the Steel Caucus. He also served as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policies, the Special Committee on Aging, and the Republican Conference Task Force on Job Training and Education.\n\nHe was elected chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for two terms, 1979-1981 and 1985-1987.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" noted that Heinz built a solid record in the Senate as \"a persistent defender of the nation's growing elderly population and of the declining steel industry\", that he was \"instrumental in pushing through legislation that put the Social Security system on sounder financial footing,\" and \"played a major role in strengthening laws regulating retirement policies, pension plans, health insurance and nursing homes\", and \"pushed successfully for trade laws that encourage American exports and protect American products, like steel, from foreign imports.\"\n\nOn April 4, 1991, Heinz and six other people, including two children, were killed when a Sun Co. Aviation Department Bell 412 helicopter and a Piper Aerostar with Heinz aboard collided in mid-air above Merion Elementary School in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. All aboard both aircraft, as well as two children at the school, were killed. The helicopter had been dispatched to investigate a problem with the landing gear of Heinz's plane. While moving in for a closer look, the helicopter collided with the plane, causing both aircraft to lose control and crash. The subsequent NTSB investigation attributed the cause of the crash to poor judgment by the pilots of the two aircraft involved.\n\nFollowing a funeral at Heinz Chapel in Pittsburgh and a Washington, D.C. memorial service that was attended by President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, Senator Heinz's remains were interred in the Heinz family mausoleum in Homewood Cemetery, located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nHeinz's long time friend, Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado, remarked: \"He really believed he could make the world a better place, such a contrast to the jaded resignation of our time. He could send the Senate leadership up a wall faster than anyone I've seen.\" Heinz's son André said at the services: \"Dad, I am so grateful for the time we had, and I miss you and I love you.\"\n\nHeinz's widow, Teresa Heinz, in 1995 married Heinz's U.S. Senate colleague and future Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nThe John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum (formerly known as the Tinicum Wildlife Preserve) was renamed in his honor following his death. The 1,200 acre (4.9 km²) refuge includes the largest remaining freshwater tidal marsh in Pennsylvania, as well as other habitats that are home to a variety of plants and animals native to Southeastern Pennsylvania.\n\nHis family established the Heinz Awards in 1993, which honor individual innovation in five categories. One of the Jefferson Awards for Public Service annual awards, for \"Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official\", is named in his honor.\n\nSeveral institutions bear his name, including:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3257208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3257208", "title": "José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz", "text": "José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz\n\nJosé Alfredo Martínez de Hoz (13 August 1925 – 16 March 2013) was an Argentine executive and policy maker. He served as Minister of the Economy under \"de facto\" President Jorge Rafael Videla between 1976 and 1981, and shaped economic policy during the National Reorganization Process military dictatorship.\n\nMartínez de Hoz, scion of one Argentina's oldest cattle ranching families, was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pursuing higher studies at the University of Cambridge, he returned and in 1955, following the coup against President Juan Domingo Perón, he was appointed his province's Minister of the Economy. Though democracy returned to Argentina three years later, the armed forces continued to exercise vetting power over most policy and in 1963, Martínez de Hoz became one of a series of conservative Argentine Economy Ministers during Jose Maria Guido's brief presidency (an interlude marked by squabbles among the military brass and recession).\n\nBecoming an influential lobbyist for Acindar, one of Argentina's largest steel manufacturers, Martínez de Hoz became its CEO in 1968. Seven years later, after union labourers at Acindar's Villa Constitución plant elected a socialist shop steward, Martínez de Hoz retaliated by using his family's long-standing connections with the armed forces to have them brutally repressed. Supported by Metalworkers Union leader Lorenzo Miguel, security forces abducted the new shop steward, Alberto Piccinini, and about 300 others (most of whom were murdered).\n\nBy 1975, Argentina had considerably developed, but was nevertheless in the throes of some of the worst instability since 1930. Argentine public opinion turned to the military, who deposed Isabel Perón's weak regime in a March 1976 coup. Inheriting a wave of violence and 700% inflation, the new regime called on Martínez de Hoz, appointing him Minister of the Economy. Anxious to restore business confidence, announced a plan to further open Argentina's markets, believing that the country's national industry was inefficient and uncompetitive internationally. He moved to lessen Argentina's trade barriers quickly, which he believed to be a cause of economic isolation. He enjoyed the personal friendship of David Rockefeller, who facilitated Chase Manhattan and International Monetary Fund loans of nearly US$1 billion following his appointment.\n\nHe decreed a general freeze on wages, and instituted a value-added tax while rescinding the inheritance tax. As a result of the changes instituted by Martínez de Hoz, inflation fell sharply; but, many local retailers and home builders became incapable of coping with the fall in demand and declared bankruptcy.\n\nA year later, the billion-dollar trade deficit had turned around and business investment had soared by about 25%. However, real wages had lost nearly 40% of their purchasing power, and while consumer spending remained weak, the shock might have been worse but for hitherto high savings rates. Inflation revived again, and Martínez de Hoz responded in June 1977, with deregulation of the financial markets, removing checks on banks and transferring responsibility for any bad loans to the state, which took charge of their debt as needed.\n\nThe Central Bank, like many key economic posts in the Martínez de Hoz era, was led by one of a number of Chicago Boys: Adolfo Diz. Diz enacted much of the Economy Minister's financial deregulation policy, while moving to limit domestic credit. He enacted the Monetary Regulation Account Law of 1977, which raised reserve requirements to 45% of deposits, thereby doubling borrowers' interest rates while eliminating yields on demand deposits.\n\nShort-term financial speculation flourished, while chronic tax evasion and budget deficits remained high. Frequent wage freeze decrees continued to depress living standards generally and income inequality increased.\nDuring his tenure, the foreign debt increased fourfold, and disparities between the upper and lower classes became much more pronounced. The period ended in a tenfold devaluation and one of the worst financial crises in Argentine history.\n\nAgain in recession by 1978, the economy continued to be saddled with inflation around 175%. Image-conscious and so, fearful of possible riots, Martínez de Hoz relented and in December, he issued new, more generous wage guidelines. To address his fellow conservatives' fear that this might lead to even higher inflation, he introduced a novel take on the currency crawling peg: fixed, progressively smaller devaluations of the official exchange rate between the Argentine peso and the US dollar set by a monthly timetable, popularly known as the \"Tablita\".\n\nThe \"Tablita\" invariably set a slower depreciation of the peso value than what local inflation warranted and although inflation did ease somewhat, imported goods and foreign credit soon became much cheaper than those locally available. Imports almost tripled in volume and by 1980, the peso became one of the most overvalued currencies in the world; its high purchasing power abroad soon had many referring to it as \"plata dulce\" (\"sweet money\"). Record numbers of Argentines now vacationed abroad, often stocking up on appliances; between the suddenly negative trade deficit and tourists' foreign spending, however, this chalked up a then-record US$4 billion annual loss for the national balance sheet in both 1980 and 1981.\n\nHaving already suffered from weakened demand, many industries (particularly smaller factories) could not compete with the flood of imports and a second wave of industry bankruptcies began. Ostensibly to avoid a sharp rise in unemployment, Martínez de Hoz took an even more controversial step when he decided to begin absorbing private sector debts (mostly those of the well-connected, including US$700 million of Acindar's) into the national debt. One of his chief business interests, the insolvent \"Compañía Italo Argentina de Electricidad\", was nationalised at his orders at a reported cost of US$394 million.\n\nThe economy was still in relatively high gear and, with rising fiscal revenues, the nation's finances appeared healthy during 1979 and 1980. Secretly, however (as much of this data was censored at time), local speculators were taking advantage of the overvalued peso by taking up over US$30 billion in loans overseas. This money soon found itself in risky gambles at home and abroad and when one bank's Ponzi scheme collapsed in March 1980, Martínez de Hoz responded to the possible panic by luring investors with one-year treasury bills, paying 60% in US dollars. Facing these pressures, the Argentine peso increasingly became the object of short-selling by insiders, including Martínez de Hoz himself.\n\nThe end of his tenure soon near and increasingly unpopular, in April 1980 Martínez de Hoz had the Central Bank promulgate new regulations governing adjustable loans. The Central Bank Circular 1050 tied monthly loan interest payments (almost all lending in Argentina is on an adjustable basis) to the value of the US dollar vis-a-vis the peso. Borrowers were confident that the gradual peso devaluations would continue on schedule and new homeowners rushed to secure (or refinance) mortgages at these favourable terms. Brokerage houses proliferated as put options against the peso increased sharply and in February 1981, Martínez de Hoz announced the unthinkable: the time had come for a sharp devaluation. The \"Tablita\" was shattered and he retired the following month.\n\nWhat followed was one of the worst financial crises in the history of modern Argentina. Speculators quickly took advantage of the 1977 deregulation to write off their debts, legitimate borrowers (including many large employers) were faced with suddenly unaffordable US dollar payments and homeowners' monthly payments (tied by the Circular 1050 to the value of the Dollar), rose by over tenfold during the next fifteen months.\n\nIt took defeat during the disastrous Malvinas War in June 1982, to usher in more moderate leadership in the junta. In July, the new Central Bank President, Domingo Cavallo, rescinded the hated \"1050\". Thousands were saved from financial ruin by this change, but the economic damage would remain.\n\nBusiness confidence was destroyed by the whole calamity and even though Argentina's productive Agricultural sector brought in over US$34 billion in trade surpluses over the next eight years, none of it sufficed to deal with chronic capital flight or the newly monstrous public debt (US$7 billion at the start of the dictatorship, it had grown to US$43 billion by the time of the restoration of democracy in 1983).\n\nMartínez de Hoz was himself indicted in 1988 for his involvement in the human rights abuses at Acindar and spent 77 days in jail. Quickly freed, he finally benefited from a pardon by President Carlos Menem in 1990. Returning to world of high finance despite a 1992 conviction of operating a brokerage with a revoked licence, Martínez de Hoz became a member of the board of directors of two Arbitrage houses: Rohm Group and the \"Banco General de Negocios\" (\"General Business Bank\").\n\nThe General Business Bank, now defunct, later helped clients illegally wire up to US$30 billion out of the country prior to its December 2001 financial crisis.\n\nIn 2006, a judge declared the pardon unconstitutional and revoked the suspension of the judicial process dictated before, thus leaving the way open to investigate Martínez de Hoz's alleged involvement in the kidnapping and extortion of Federico and Miguel Gutheim (a local textile mill owner and his son) in 1976, as well as the murder of Juan Carlos Casariego (one of his own assistants at the Ministry of Economy).\n\nMartinez de Hoz was arrested on 5 April 2007, following a Supreme Court ruling deeming the 1990 presidential pardons unconstitutional, and was given a preliminary sentence of house arrest (due to his advanced age) on 4 May 2010, pursuant to his indictment in the Gutheim case.\n\n"}

It was constructed during 1867–68 at the request of Robert E. Lee, who was President of the University (then known as Washington College) at the time, and after whom the building is named. The Victorian brick architectural design was probably the work of his son, George Washington Custis Lee, with details contributed by Col. Thomas Williamson, an architect and professor of engineering at the neighboring Virginia Military Institute. General Lee, along with much of the rest of the Lexington community, attended church services at Grace Episcopal Church, a hundred yards south, at the edge of the college campus. (In 1903, that church was renamed R. E. Lee Memorial Episcopal Church; in 2017, its governing board voted to change its name back to Grace Episcopal Church.)\n\nWhen Lee died in 1870, he was buried beneath the chapel. His body remains there to this day, and for this reason among others, the Chapel is one of Lexington's major historical tourist attractions.\nA centerpiece on the stage of the chapel—where the pulpit would be in a less secular place of worship—is a statue of Lee, in his uniform, asleep on the battlefield (the \"Recumbent Lee\"), designed by Edward Valentine. On the walls are two paintings: one of General Washington himself, by Charles Willson Peale, from the Washington family collections, and the other of Lee in his uniform, painted by Edward Pine. There is also a plaque given by the Sigma Society on one of the walls that honors two Sigma alumni from the classes of 1912 and 1915 who lost their lives in World War I.\n\nIn the basement a crypt (added after Lee's burial) contains the remains of much of Lee's direct family: the General himself, his wife Mary, his seven children, and his parents—Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee, who had been a general during the Revolutionary War, and Anne Carter Lee. Lee's favorite horse, Traveller, is buried just outside the Chapel, where students of Washington and Lee traditionally leave coins or apples in hopes of being compensated with good fortune in their studies. In the basement of the Chapel is a museum that illuminates the history of the family of George Washington and Lee as well as that of the university itself. Lee's office has been meticulously preserved in almost exactly the same condition as it was when he died.\n\nChapel plays a role in the modern operation of Washington and Lee. It seats about 600 in its main area and in a small, three-sided balcony. Freshmen assemble there to hear the President of the University's student-run Executive Committee speak on the school's Honor System. Important school-wide lectures, concerts, and other notable activities are held there from time to time. On August 6, 2014, the Confederate flags in the chapel were removed after student protests. It was then agreed that the chapel's original flags, which were retired in the 1990s due to deterioration, were to be put on display on a rotating basis in the chapel's museum.\n\nLee Chapel was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963. It is open for tours based on the following schedule: \n\n\n"}

In 1956 he moved to Singapore to join his father, following the death of his mother.\n\nFrom when he was just a boy, Ahmad showed a keen interest in the business world. He set up a stall next to his father’s, where he sold handkerchiefs that he had purchased with his own money. This stall inspired his father to move over to garment (from his food stall) business in Campbell Lane. He left school early (he was a student at Christ Church Secondary School) so that he could start his own business. \n\nIn 1971 he rented a space at No.1, Campbell Lane as started his business selling ready made garments under the name of Mustaq Ahmad. Within two years he had done so well that since lease was expiring he started looking for new places to continue the business.\n\nIn 1973 he secured new places at 19 Campbell Lane and 67 Serangoon road. His father and uncle named it Mohamed Mustafa & Samsuddin.\n\nIt was while he was still just a teenager, helping his father that the idea of selling products at a fixed price came to him. At the time, this was quite a revolution away from current business practices. This greatly pleased customers who appreciated competitive pricing without the need for bargaining.\n\nIt was when rent on the store escalated by 70 percent that Mustafa felt it was time to buy. He purchased 20 stores on Syed Alwi Road which he converted to a 75,000 square foot department store containing a hotel with 130 rooms that opened in 1995 but was open to business as a 24-hour-a-day store, in 2003.\n\nMustafa Centre has since expanded to the building across Verdun Road and has more than 250,000 wide-ranging products including produce and appliances. The Centre is also home to: a jewel mart, money-changing services, a pharmacy, postal services, supermarket and travel services.\n\nTogether with the store he reopened at Serangoon Plaza following its 2004 renovation, his empire turns over a staggering $302m per annum.\n\nThe Singapore Tourism Board named Mustaq “Tourism Entrepreneur of the Year” in 2004. He received this because of his great contribution to the country’s tourism industry, since his stores are a “must-visit” destination for the hundreds of thousands of Indian tourists that come each year.\n"}

{"id": "3740931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3740931", "title": "Nikos Galis", "text": "Nikos Galis\n\nNikolaos Georgalis (; born July 23, 1957), commonly known as either Nikos Galis (), or Nick Galis, is a retired Greek American professional basketball player. He was named one of FIBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1991, is an inaugural member of the FIBA Hall of Fame and was chosen as one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors in 2008. \nGalis is widely regarded as one of Europe's greatest scorers to ever play the game, as well as one of the all-time greatest players in FIBA international basketball history. In 2017, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nGalis played the point guard position during his college basketball years at Seton Hall University, but turned into a shooting guard as a professional. He spent most of his career in Aris, before having a late stint with Panathinaikos. He is the EuroLeague's all-time leader in points per game (counting both FIBA Europe and Euroleague Basketball Company era games 1958 season–present), leading the competition in scoring eight times. In the premier European club scene, he reached the EuroLeague Final Four on four occasions, three consecutive times with Aris (1988, 1989, and 1990), and another one with Panathinaikos (1994). An eight-time Greek league champion, Galis is the Greek Championship's unofficial all-time leading scorer, in both career points scored and career scoring average, counting all league formats (since the 1963–64 season, official stats are recognized since the 1992–93 season).\n\nGalis led the senior Greek national team to a EuroBasket gold medal in 1987, as well as to a EuroBasket silver medal in 1989, earning the tournament MVP honor in 1987, and being elected to the All-EuroBasket Team four times. Among his myriad accomplishments, he holds the EuroBasket record for highest career scoring average (31.2 points per game), and was the leading scorer of four EuroBasket tournaments in 1983, 1987, 1989, and 1991. In addition to that, he holds the FIBA World Cup record for highest career scoring average (33.5 points per game), as well as for most points ever scored in a single tournament, which he set at the 1986 FIBA World Cup. Following the stunning success of the EuroBasket title in 1987, he won the Mr. Europa Player of the Year and the Euroscar awards the same year.\n\nNicknamed \"Iron Man\", \"Nick The Greek\", and \"The Gangster\", Galis is highly revered in Greece, where he is considered by many to be the greatest national athlete the country has ever seen. His years at Aris lifted Greek basketball from relative obscurity, to global power status, with Galis being the figure that eventually inspired thousands of Greeks to take up the game.\n\nGalis was born in Union City, New Jersey. The child of a poor immigrant family, from the Greek islands of Rhodes and Nisyros, Galis took up boxing in his early years, after his father, George Georgalis, who had also been a boxer in his youth. He was later persuaded to give up boxing by his mother, Stella Georgalis, who was terrified after each time that her son would return home from boxing training with a new facial injury. As a result, Galis started playing the sport of basketball instead of boxing. He attended Union Hill High School, in Union City, where he also played high school basketball.\n\nAfter high school, Galis enrolled at Seton Hall University, where he played college basketball as a member of the Seton Hall Pirates. In his senior season, Galis saw his scoring average reach 27.5 points per game, which was third in the nation, behind Idaho State's Lawrence Butler (30.1 points per game) and Indiana State's Larry Bird (28.6 points per game), including a 48-point outburst against the University of Santa Clara. \n\nAlso in his senior year of college, Galis won the Haggerty Award (the New York City metro area's best player award), and the Eastern College Athletic Conference Player of the Year award. The same year, he also played in the Pizza Hut All-American game, alongside Bird and Vinnie Johnson. During his 4 year college career, Galis played in a total of 107 games and scored 1,651 points, for a career scoring average of 15.4 points per game. \n\nGalis' head coach at Seton Hall, Billy Raftery, would later state that Galis was the best player he ever coached. While at Seton Hall, Galis was a good friend and roommate of Italian-American professional basketball player Dan Callandrillo. Galis was later inducted into the Seton Hall Athletic Hall of Fame, in 1991.\n\nAfter finishing his collegiate career in 1979, Galis signed with agent Bill Manon, who also managed Diana Ross. Manon did not have Galis work out with any NBA team. Galis was eventually selected by the Boston Celtics in the 4th round of the 1979 NBA Draft, 68th overall. Due to a severe ankle injury that Galis suffered during the Celtics preseason training camp of the 1979–80 season, the franchise was no longer interested in offering him a contract because Gerald Henderson had taken his place on the team, and his injury would keep him out for the foreseeable future. \n\nGalis then decided to pursue a professional career in Greece's top-tier level Basket League. Later, while still playing in Greece, he would be offered NBA contracts by the Celtics and the New Jersey Nets. However, he turned the offers down, because at the time, and until 1989, FIBA did not have professional status, and consequently did not allow NBA players to compete at the national team level. Since playing with the senior Greek national team meant so much to him, he stayed in Greece. Celtics legend Red Auerbach later said that the single biggest mistake he ever made in his career was not keeping Galis.\n\nAfter suffering an ankle injury in the Boston Celtics 1979–80 preseason training camp, which prevented him from receiving a contract with the Celtics, Galis made the move across the Atlantic, and signed to play with Aris of Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1979. Panathinaikos and Olympiacos had also shown some interest in signing the newcomer, but it was Aris' interest that was the most persuasive. His move to the country would eventually help Greek club basketball to reach a level of popularity that had never been previously imagined. \n\nAveraging more than 30 points per game every season, Galis was the indisputable leader of Aris. While playing alongside other great players at Aris such as Panagiotis Giannakis and Slobodan Subotić (who was known in Greece as Lefteris Soumpotits), Galis won 8 Greek League championships (7 of them consecutively, and 3 undefeated, in the years 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991), 6 Greek Cups (4 of them consecutively, in the years 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992), and led Aris to 3 consecutive appearances at the FIBA European Champions' Cup (now called EuroLeague) Final Four ('88, '89, and '90). In the one disappointment of an otherwise glittering career with Aris, all three of the FIBA European Champions' Cup Final Four appearances ended in defeat in the semifinals, thus depriving Galis of the opportunity to shine all the way on Europe's biggest club stage, at the FIBA European Champions' Cup Finals. The team's performances and general standard of play, however, won the hearts of most basketball fans in Greece. Indeed, cinemas and theaters in Greece would often reduce their admission prices on Thursday evenings, when Aris was playing games, as large segments of the country settled down to watch them on television.\n\nAfter a disappointing season in 1991–92, Galis was forced to leave Aris. The new management of the team, and the fact that the club was in decline, were the main causes for his departure. Galis, who adored the city of Thessaloniki, had originally insisted on remaining in the club and playing for the team, as he believed that he still had a lot to offer the club.\n\nGalis moved to Athens in the summer of 1992, to play with Panathinaikos, and he was the player who then led the \"Greens\" to a club rebirth, after it had suffered through a long drought period, during which the historical team remained without titles. The previous season (1991–92) had been particularly disappointing for the club, with the team finishing eighth in the Greek league. As the team's captain, Galis inspired the young players of Panathinaikos, such as Fragiskos Alvertis and Nikos Oikonomou, and gradually brought back hope to the team's fans. So much so, as to the point that the club's then home arena, Glyfada Indoor Hall, was always overcrowded. In that season (1992–93), Panathinaikos finished second in the Greek league, and won the Greek Cup, which was the seventh Greek Cup title for Galis.\n\nThe following season (1993–94), Galis was the FIBA European League (now called EuroLeague) Top Scorer averaging 23.8 points per game in 21 games, and passer, averaging 4.7 assists per game, in 21 games. In the decisive game 3 of the EuroLeague quarterfinals, against the reigning FIBA European League champions, Limoges, Galis truly led Panathinaikos into a new club era, with their qualification to the 1994 FIBA European League Final Four, by scoring 30 points on 75% field goal shooting in the game. The \"Greens\" eventually finished in 3rd place in the FIBA European League that season, after losing in the semifinal, but it was still a success they had never reached before. Galis scored 30 points in the third place game against FC Barcelona, leading all scorers in the game.\n\nIn his third season in Panthinaikos (1994–95), Galis teamed up with Panagiotis Giannakis and Žarko Paspalj, to make a strong effort to win the FIBA European League. Galis was the player who led Panathinaikos to the Top 16 group, as he prevented the elimination of Panathinaikos by Budivelnik Kiev, with a team-high 23 points in the decisive second-leg victory. He was also the leader of the team in the Greek Cup win against Olympiacos, at Sporting Sports Arena. But Galis' career controversially ended on October 18, 1994, a few games after the start of the Greek League 1994–95 season. Kostas Politis, Panathinaikos' head coach at the time, chose not to include Galis in the starting line-up of a Greek League game against Ambelokipi. Galis left the court, and never again returned to playing action. His last game in professional basketball, was as a player of Panathinaikos, in a game against AO Dafni, on October 12, 1994. In the game, Galis scored 8 points in 35 minutes of playing time, as his team won in a blowout, 82–60.\n\n\nOn 20 November 1983, while playing in an exhibition game at the Demetria Tournament '83, with the senior Greek national basketball team, against the North Carolina Tar Heels, at Alexandreio Melathron, Greece's shooting guard Galis, while being guarded by North Carolina's shooting guard, Michael Jordan, scored 24 points during the game.\n\nGalis next led the Greek national team to the EuroBasket 1987 gold medal. Averaging 37.0 points per game during the tournament, he was named the MVP of the tournament, after scoring 40 points in the final against the Soviet Union national basketball team and its legendary player, Šarūnas Marčiulionis, for a 103–101 victory. Galis also led Greece to the second place at the EuroBasket 1989, averaging 35.6 points per game. Galis is most remembered from that tournament, for a stunning effort against the Soviet team led by Marčiulionis, and its other star player, Arvydas Sabonis, in the semifinal game. He scored 45 out of his team's 81 total points in a dramatic, last-gasp 81–80 victory. The Greek team then settled for a second-place finish, after losing against the ever-dominant Yugoslavian national basketball team in the tournament's final.\n\nWith the senior men's Greek national team, Galis averaged 33.3 points per game at the EuroBasket 1983, 33.5 points per game at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, 37.0 points per game at the EuroBasket 1987, 35.6 points per game at the EuroBasket 1989, and 32.4 points per game at the EuroBasket 1991. He won the gold medal at the EuroBasket 1987, and the silver medal at the EuroBasket 1989. He was the leading scorer of the EuroBasket four times, was a four-time All-EuroBasket Team member, and he was named the MVP of the EuroBasket 1987.\n\nHe was also the leading scorer of the 1986 FIBA World Championship, where he led all players in scoring average, with 33.5 points per game. In that tournament, he had a 53-point outburst against the Panamanian national basketball team. In total, Galis played in 168 games with the senior Greek national team, in which he scored a total of 5,129 points, for a scoring average of 30.5 points per game.\n\nIt has been noted that Galis was not only a legendary scorer, but that he was also a great play maker and passer. The majority of his points scored came inside the paint, due to his penetrating ability. Galis' mid-range jumper was one of his biggest offensive weapons, being able to consistently pull it off under pressure. His post game was excellent, as he used his strength and leaping ability to counter his lack of height. Another enormous competitive advantage that Galis possessed was his incredible stamina, which was due to his exemplary physical condition. This led to his being given the nickname of \"Iron Man\". At the EuroBasket 1987, he was never once substituted out of any game after the second day of the competition, completing 7 games in 9 days.\n\nSince his official retirement on September 29, 1995, and up until early 2006, Galis was the owner of a summer basketball camp in Chalkidiki, Greece. The basketball camp is listed at the Athens Stock Exchange. As a token of appreciation for his contribution to Greek sport, Galis was chosen to be the first torch bearer in the final round of the Olympic Flame, for the Athens 2004 Olympics. Galis entered the stadium at the conclusion of the Opening Ceremony, and set off the procession of the flame to the altar.\n\nIn September 2007, Galis was elected as a member of the first class of the FIBA Hall of Fame, which includes the best basketball players in the history of the game internationally. Galis was inducted as a player. Bill Russell of the famous Boston Celtics dynasty was another one of the 16 inaugural player inductees. Galis is also a member of the Eurobasket.com website's European Basketball Hall of Fame, inducted as a player. Galis is married to Eleni Panagiotou, and he has one daughter, named Stella.\n\nIn May 2013, his former club team Aris, renamed their home arena to Nick Galis Hall, organized a celebration of Galis' life and career, and retired his number 6 Aris jersey. The event was attended by many of his teammates and opponents from the 1980s and 1990s. Attendees included Greek legends such as the majority of the 1987 EuroBasket gold medal winning team, as well as international stars who played against Galis over the years, such as Dino Rađja, Jordi Villacampa, and Doron Jamchi.\n\nOn April 1, 2017, it was announced that Galis will be inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as part of the 2017 class. Galis was accepted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2017. He became one of the very few basketball players from around the world, that joined the Hall of Fame, without having ever played in the NBA. On June 14, 2016, exactly 29 years after Greece won the EuroBasket in 1987, the biggest basketball arena in Greece, OAKA Olympic Indoor Hall was named 'Nikos Galis' in his honour.\n\n\"If I'm the devil's son, then Galis is the devil himself.\", Dražen Petrović\n\n\"If Galis wants to score, he will score no matter who's defending him.\", Arvydas Sabonis\n\n\"I never thought that there was such a good offensive player in Europe, and especially in Greece.\", Michael Jordan\n\n\"\"Although Drazen (i.e. Petrović) is my brother, for the best athlete of 1987, I voted for Galis.\", Aco Petrović\"'\n\n\"I had given specific instructions on how to defend against the other 4 players. As for Nikos, we just had to sit down and pray!\", Vojcek Kricovski, CSKA Moscow coach.\n\n\"There is only one way I can think of to stop Nikos from scoring! Lock him up in the hotel!\", Roud Harevain, Maccabi Tel-Aviv head coach.\n\n<br>\nGalis won numerous titles and awards during his career and had many memorable single game performances.

{"id": "2270140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270140", "title": "Pre-determined overhead rate", "text": "Pre-determined overhead rate\n\nA pre-determined overhead rate is the rate used to apply manufacturing overhead to work-in-process inventory. The pre-determined overhead rate is calculated before the period begins. The first step is to estimate the amount of the activity base that will be required to support operations in the upcoming period. The second step is to estimate the total manufacturing cost at that level of activity. The third step is to compute the predetermined overhead rate by dividing the estimated total manufacturing overhead costs by the estimated total amount of cost driver or activity base. Common activity bases used in the calculation include direct labor costs, direct labor hours, or machine hours.\n\nThis is related to an activity rate which is a similar calculation used in Activity-based costing. A pre-determined overhead rate is normally the term when using a single, plant-wide base to calculate and apply overhead. Overhead is then applied by multiplying the pre-determined overhead rate by the \"actual\" driver units. Any difference between applied overhead and the amount of overhead actually incurred is called over- or under-applied overhead.\n\nInstead of using a pre-determined rate based on estimates, why not base the overhead rate on the actual total manufacturing overhead cost and the actual total amount of the activity base incurred on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis? If an actual rate is computed monthly or quarterly, seasonal factors in overhead costs or in the activity base can produce fluctuations in the overhead rate. For example, the costs of heating and cooling a factory in Illinois will be highest in the winter and summer months and lowest in the spring and fall. If the overhead rate is recomputed at the end of each month or each quarter based on actual costs and activity, the overhead rate would go up in the winter and summer and down in the spring and fall. As a result, two identical jobs, one completed in the winter and one completed in the spring, would be assigned different manufacturing overhead costs. Many managers believe that such fluctuations in product costs serve no useful purpose. To avoid such fluctuations, actual overhead rates could be computed on an annual or less-frequent basis. However, if the overhead rate is computed annually based on the actual costs and activity for the year, the manufacturing overhead assigned to any particular job would not be known until the end of the year. For example, the cost of Job 2B47 at Yost Precision Machining would not be known until the end of the year, even though the job will be completed and shipped to the customer in March. For these reasons, most companies use predetermined overhead rates rather than actual overhead rates in their cost accounting systems.\n\nThe use of such a rate enables an enterprise to determine the approximate total cost of each job when completed. In recent years increased automation in manufacturing operations has resulted in a trend towards machine hours as the activity base in the calculation.\n\nTo find the overhead rate, first determine the right basis that will describe the best the behavior of the cost. Then, divide the total budgeted overhead by the basis to calculate the overhead rate:\n\nThere are many ways that can be used to determine the right basis for a given order. These bases are:\n\nIn order to find the overhead rate we will use the same basis that we hahellohosen by multiplying this basis by the calculated rate. For example, if we choose the labor hours to be the basis then we will multiply the rate by the direct labor hours in each task during the manufacturing process.\n\nFundamentals of Cost Accounting.

{"id": "26530815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26530815", "title": "Repo 105", "text": "Repo 105\n\nRepo 105 is Lehman Brothers' name for an accounting maneuver that it used where a short-term repurchase agreement is classified as a sale. The cash obtained through this \"sale\" is then used to pay down debt, allowing the company to appear to reduce its leverage by temporarily paying down liabilities—just long enough to reflect on the company's published balance sheet. After the company's financial reports are published, the company borrows cash and repurchases its original assets.\n\nRepo 105 was used by investment bank Lehman Brothers three times according to a March 2010 report by the bankruptcy court examiner. The report stated that Lehman's auditors, Ernst & Young, were aware of this questionable classification. Law firm Linklaters has received unfavorable press treatment in relation to their issuance of an English law opinion which characterised the arrangements as a \"true sale\" as opposed to a transfer by Lehman with a charge back in favour of the transferor, although there is no suggestion that their advice was wrong. Apparently, the use of the British law firm was necessitated by the fact no law firm in the US was prepared to give a legal opinion on the legality of the use of Repo 105 http://www.dailyfinance.com/2010/12/23/fraud-files-is-ernst-and-young-to-blame-in-lehman-bros-fraud/\n\nThe report published, on March 11, 2010, was titled \"Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Chapter 11 Proceedings\". The Examiner in this matter was Anton R. Valukas, Chairman of Jenner & Block. The report details the use of both \"repo 105\" and \"repo 108\" which are basically identical procedures, the first costing 5% and the second 8% of the assets exchanged. In other words, assets valued at 105 will produce 100 in cash, assets valued at 108 will produce 100 in cash respectively.\n\nAfter the Examiner’s report was published, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent letters to chief financial officers of nearly two dozen large financial and insurance companies asking about their firms' use of repurchase agreements, including the number and amount of such agreements that qualify for sales accounting, and detailed analysis of why such transactions can be treated as sales. SEC chairman, Mary Schapiro, indicated that the agency was trying to determine whether other companies used similar techniques as the \"repo 105\" used by Lehman Brothers.\n\nIn response to the report, the auditors said that the transactions were accounted for in line with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. However, New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo filed charges against Ernst & Young in December 2010, alleging that the firm \"substantially assisted... a massive accounting fraud\" by approving the accounting treatment. The \"Wall Street Journal\" drew attention to the increasing levels of fees that Ernst & Young had been paid by Lehman from 2001 to 2008.\n\nThe IASB and FASB, senior bodies responsible for setting accounting standards, met in April 2010 to review the accounting treatment for such repo transactions.\n\nSeveral writers have basically stated that Repo 105 was essentially a tobashi scheme.\n\n"}

{"id": "6874024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6874024", "title": "Sales outsourcing", "text": "Sales outsourcing\n\nSales outsourcing is a way for companies to attract increased, high volumes of sales for their products or services by using a third party. The company typically uses outsourcing companies to improve sales volumes without links to the sales teams that carry out those campaigns. The company that undertakes the outsourcing will normally be paid based on the results they are able to generate, and therefore creates a mutually beneficial situation for both client and the outsourcing company. \n\nFull 'sales outsourcing' is observed when companies have an external third party sales force. It is differentiated from value added reselling or distribution in that the business model can be based on shared risk, although there are models where the outsourcer is paid for all of their activity - just as with a hired direct sales force, but the outsourcer provides rapidity, flexibility and experience. \nOther names for sales outsourcing include 'indirect sales' and 'channel sales'.\n\nFull sales outsourcing is different from telemarketing in that it requires direct recruitment of sales personnel with specific backgrounds for each sales campaign. Usually the sales executives will be part of a team that may include telemarketing, marketing, tools systems and methodologies as well as sales management.\n\nSales outsourcing firms provide accountability regarding all sales results and activities while representing the brand of the client. For the end-customer, it usually appears as if the sales team sold the product themselves rather than the sales outsourcing firm. The outsourcing firm is, in essence, an extension of the client but is responsible for all operations associated with direct sales activities, often receiving sales engineering and initial product/service training support from the client.\n\nThe sole purpose of a contract sales organization is to provide sales resource to its clients, without taking title to their products. Sales outsourcing providers include manufacturers' representatives, contract sales organizations, sales agents or sales outsourcing consultants. One way of organising the sales effort, especially when product delivery is erratic, is to replace or supplement internal resources with functionality and expertise brought in from contract sales organisations.\n\nSales outsourcing is quite different from large-scale service outsourcing, which has its advantages but also requires pro-active contract and relationship management. In addition to full sales outsourcing, many partial models are observed, particularly in large firms.\n\nSales outsourcing is expected to be cheaper than the fully loaded cost of employing salespeople, but calculating the cost comparison over time is far from straightforward. Nevertheless, replacing fixed costs with variable costs is attractive to budget-holders. However, unlike many forms of outsourcing, the advantages of sales outsourcing does not often come from saving costs but rather increasing revenue or providing speed of response or flexibility.\n\nThe business case for sales outsourcing should also include consideration of the cost of controlling the contract. Difficulty in measuring the link between sales activity and sales performance leads to a preference for employed salespeople. However, the issues internally are often the same and the internal hire has many other corporate \"distractions\" that do not occur with external resources.\n\nCompanies may also choose sales outsourcing as a means of accessing the best sales skills. Although the pejorative term “rent-a-rep” is still used, there is some evidence that contractors are perceived as good performers against qualitative as well as quantitative performance criteria. Even so, the reputational risk of third parties handling customer relationships has been observed as a factor restricting sales outsourcing. One could argue that an employee is often using a company to gain 2–3 years salary and experience whereas a sales outsourcing firm would usually be looking at a long term contract even though the staff may change during that time. So the aims of an outsourcer can be closely aligned with the aims and objectives of the contracting company.\n\nA recent study has highlighted flexibility as an important driver for outsourcing sales. Uncertain business environments accentuate the need to turn sales resource on and off quickly. Industries and companies undergoing rapid change may need to avoid hiring and firing costs and risks. Contract sales organizations can absorb employment risk, enabling their clients to respond to short-term opportunities or competitor activity (see Lean startup). However, an outsourcer may build in more of a premium to the rate or commission if excessive flexibility is required on a contract.\n\nContract sales organizations are growing in volume and influence, able to provide both tactical activity and long-term strategic support to their clients.\n\nSpeed of response is seen as a key reason to use an outsourcer. If a company was looking to enter a market it may take several months to recruit the local manager which then takes several months to find an office and build a team. With an outsourcer, a full working team can oftentimes be operational within a matter of days or weeks.\n\nSales outsourcing can also be used as a market entry strategy and avoids permanent establishment risk.\n\nThe experience of many organizations over the past several years demonstrates that indirect channels can be critical to expanding market coverage. This has been particularly true in the electronics, communications and high tech sectors. For example, the indirect channel now accounts for 66 percent of overall technology sales, up from 53 percent in 1997.\n\nSome examples of communications companies who employ indirect sales forces to their internal sales efforts include: AireSpring, AT&T, Comcast, Earthlink Business, Integra Telecom, Level 3 Communications, Time Warner Cable, TelePacific, tw telecom, XO Communications, and Windstream. Some top sales agencies who sell voice and data services for these carriers include Telarus, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Intelisys, based in Petaluma, California, and Telecom Brokerage Inc (TBI), based in Chicago, Illinois.\n"}
{"id": "8868765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8868765", "title": "Smiling curve", "text": "Smiling curve\n\nIn business management theory, the smiling curve is a graphical depiction of how value added varies across the different stages of bringing a product on to the market in an IT-related manufacturing industry. The concept was first proposed around 1992 by Stan Shih, the founder of Acer Inc., an IT company headquartered in Taiwan. According to Shih's observation, in the personal computer industry, the two ends of the value chain – conception and marketing – command higher values added to the product than the middle part of the value chain – manufacturing. If this phenomenon is presented in a graph with a Y-axis for value-added and an X-axis for value chain (stage of production), the resulting curve appears like a \"smile\".\n\nBased on this model, the Acer company adopted a business strategy to reorient itself from manufacturing into global marketing of brand-name PC-related products and services. Acer accordingly invested heavily in R&D to develop innovative technology. The concept later became widely cited to describe the distribution of value-adding potentials in other types of industry to justify business strategies aimed at higher value-adding activities.\n\nAlthough the smile curve theory is very simple but it points out the future direction of Taiwan’s industrial efforts, the only way is moving and positioning towards high value-adding block through the guidance of value-adding concept, therefore, the industry can continue the development and sustainable management. Although the construction is one of the locomotive industry, but under a mature industrial trend, market saturation and traditional manufacturing which only concerned low value-adding area, has experienced a decade of economic downturn. Smiling curve theory can provide a new thinking direction.\n\nThe most lucrative value area focus on both ends of the value chain – R&D and marketing. The only thing can do is just agency or OEM without R&D capability, which earn a little money;\nWithout marketing ability, the product will only be treated as rubbish over disposal period.\n\nBYD's Wang once lamented that Chinese companies had only learned how to organize workers, but have not learned how to organize engineers, it can only make a living in the most inhospitable terrain area of the manufacturing. If it can use advanced methods to organize a large number of Chinese Engineers, then China is the entrepreneur's treasure. Typically, knowledge-intensive organizations can find ways to organize engineers. Management master Peter Drucker said: \"The most important management in the 21st century is to manage those intelligent workers.\" Which is the most successful aspect that Huawei has done among the Chinese companies. Among those employees, technology research and developing staff accounted for 46%, marketing and service staff accounted for 33%, management and other personnel accounted for 9%, and the remaining 12% is workers. For 20 years, Huawei has maintained this ratio, human resource allocation shows “high developing and marketing on both sides\" of the \"smile curve.\" \n\nStan Shih ‘s smiling curve is promoted in order to reproducing Acer. However, there must be some breed factors. Some of the factors behind the birth may exist as follows:\n\nUnder the trend of globalization of high-tech product markets, we can use the \"chase, catch, run, jump, touch\" five words to describe the competitive pressures of the industry. Competitive enterprises continue to catch up, ready to catch up with the leaders, and those leading companies continue to run forward in order to stay ahead of the distance, and finding methods to jump over the barriers. Therefore, the market becomes saturated, only head-on, make price competition, even bloody competition exist. This is the fate of global competition, only the fittest survive.\n\nHigh-tech products, unless mastering the key technologies or components, among the finished product market, because the fast speed of technology development, fashion also changes quickly, product life periods are changing rapidly, so-called niche products, sometimes become a few % of the profit gross during a few years, therefore generating tremendous pressure on enterprises.\n\nUnder the pressure of the foregoing, if technology cannot always be upgraded, strategy cannot leading the market, then under the less profit situation, may turn into a loss, more seriously, even gradually affecting the survival of the enterprise.\n\nThe value-added of an enterprise can be said that the potential for profit. Mature technology, low requirement to entry, and universalization of technology is easy to become so-called \"low-profit\" enterprise, also known as low-value-added industries. Normal manufacturing, assembly enterprise is called low-value-added industries, in order to survive, only to keep expanding production capacity to maintain profits. But as long as the market is shrinking, product prices is decreasing, product sales will no longer growing. Enterprise will face to risk immediately.\n\nIn order to overcome the pressure of low added value, enterprises only thinking is to move toward the block which high-value added industry trends. In the industry, mastering the key technology and key components is high added value; general manufacturing or OEM is low added value; product integration services, due to combine a lot of added value, therefore becoming another high-value-added block.\n\nAmong the blocks of high value-added, the key technologies and key components, may sold to various needs of world market; but integrated services, need to have an appropriate area, and entire industry in this region also has reached considerable development.\n\nEnterprise’s products and services need to have sustained value-added (earnings), so that can be able to survive.\n\nThe direction and services of high value-added products is only way to have a high potential for profit, therefore to ensure business continuity.\n\nSmile curve theory has basically proved that the success of products is inextricably related to concept, research, brand spreading and marketing. Those factors require the company hire and retain highly skilled, intelligent, professionals. Typically, those professionals will be highly paid, so that countries with high smile curve slope will get more profits, therefore generating growing gaps between countries.\n\nLike United States and other developed countries, they have maintained highly slope of the smile curve, however, developing countries such as India and China confined to low-level employing and manufacturing. Therefore, if developing countries want to achieve to highly slope of the smile curve, they need more professional analysts, researchers and brand developers to reach higher levels of economic growth. In other words, if developing countries want to compete with developed countries equally, they must require a highly skilled and knowledge team in order to achieve these, government needs to invest heavily and support on basic education and higher education. In the long-term development, manufacturing country in the world will hardly to sustain the level of economic growth. Developing countries need to let the smiling curve more smile, therefore there will be a fair competition with developed countries.\n\nSome developing countries have begun the development of trade and investment liberalization, and the company's internal production network has become globalized. Depending on the strengths of each country, manufacturing form of the developing countries are generally labor-intensive, which means that they only provided low-wage to workers, but those high-tech jobs, such as research and development, are to be borne by the developed countries.\n\nThe current situation is that between developed and developing countries, there are lots of flowing products and intermediate goods. This phenomenon which cooperating among the same industry is known as horizontal division of labor. \nHowever, the more accurate name is called vertical division of labor. However, because there are various ways of processes between developed and developing countries, developed countries always focus on high-value process while developing countries always focus on low-value-added processes.\n\nFareed Zakaria's writings mentioned, the significance of China and their traditional manufacturing dominance, China's manufacturing industry is in the middle stages, so that means production, plus some spare parts supply and engineering design. However, developed countries such as the United States has two complete form, so that is generated smiley curve, the curve shows the value added profits at every stage, and brand and product concepts at high point, the manufacturing industry is located below, values in the retail and service phases rise again. \nWith the end of the Cold War and the former socialist countries into the global economy, there was more and more cheap labor, while developing countries have been watching their profits decline, then resulting in fierce competition. Therefore, increasing the slope of the smile curve.\n\nSmile curve assumes a phenomenon, in the middle of the process of value-added profits or assembly-type manufacturing value chain is assembled, these processes have a downward trend, which increases at both ends of these processes of the value chain, are the raw material at one end of chain and at the other sales service. This assumption has caused an intense global competition which increasing in the assembly of standardized and modular components.\n\nReport examines the assembly-type manufacturing value chain and the formation of the smile curve. Because it use the ratio of the profit as a performance indicator. All the sources of products produced broader concept in industrial processes. Input-output tables and each firm's annual financial statements were used to calculate total assets and operating surplus.\n\nThe assembly-type manufacturing industry also can be analyzed from:\n\nIn this research, the smile curve explained the household electronic appliances, computer equipment and ancillary equipment, as well as the three sectors trucks, buses and other vehicles. However, the smile curve cannot explain the other three sectors, and assembly-type manufacturing industry as a whole.\n\n‘Clockwise’ company is one of the smiling curve practitioners, founded in 1991. Turning occurred in 2004, this year, the ‘Clockwise’ pay all attention on cotton underwear industry, formed a strategic alliance with Colored Cotton Group, controlled famous brand cotton \"Choi days” upstream resources, meanwhile use media to publish brand. ‘Clockwise’ business total sales breakthrough billion yuan, became the industry leader.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "896574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=896574", "title": "Throughput accounting", "text": "Throughput accounting\n\nThroughput accounting (TA) is a principle-based and simplified management accounting approach that provides managers with decision support information for enterprise profitability improvement. TA is relatively new in management accounting. It is an approach that identifies factors that limit an organization from reaching its goal, and then focuses on simple measures that drive behavior in key areas towards reaching organizational goals. TA was proposed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt as an alternative to traditional cost accounting. As such, Throughput Accounting is neither cost accounting nor costing because it is cash focused and does not allocate all costs (variable and fixed expenses, including overheads) to products and services sold or provided by an enterprise. Considering the laws of variation, only costs that vary totally with units of output (see definition of T below for TVC) e.g. raw materials, are allocated to products and services which are deducted from sales to determine Throughput. Throughput Accounting is a management accounting technique used as the performance measure in the Theory of Constraints (TOC). It is the business intelligence used for maximizing profits, however, unlike cost accounting that primarily focuses on 'cutting costs' and reducing expenses to make a profit, Throughput Accounting primarily focuses on generating more throughput. Conceptually, Throughput Accounting seeks to increase the speed or rate at which throughput (see definition of T below) is generated by products and services with respect to an organization's constraint, whether the constraint is internal or external to the organization. Throughput Accounting is the only management accounting methodology that considers constraints as factors limiting the performance of organizations.\n\nManagement accounting is an organization's internal set of techniques and methods used to maximize shareholder wealth. Throughput Accounting is thus part of the management accountants' toolkit, ensuring efficiency where it matters as well as the overall effectiveness of the organization. It is an internal reporting tool. Outside or external parties to a business depend on accounting reports prepared by financial (public) accountants who apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and enforced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other local and international regulatory agencies and bodies such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nThroughput Accounting improves profit performance with better management decisions by using measurements that more closely reflect the effect of decisions on three critical monetary variables (throughput, investment (AKA inventory), and operating expense — defined below).\n\nWhen cost accounting was developed in the 1890s, labor was the largest fraction of product cost and could be considered a variable cost. Workers often did not know how many hours they would work in a week when they reported on Monday morning because time-keeping systems were rudimentary. Cost accountants, therefore, concentrated on how efficiently managers used labor since it was their most important variable resource. Now however, workers who come to work on Monday morning almost always work 40 hours or more; their cost is fixed rather than variable. However, today, many managers are still evaluated on their labor efficiencies, and many \"downsizing,\" \"rightsizing,\" and other labor reduction campaigns are based on them.\n\nGoldratt argues that, under current conditions, labor efficiencies lead to decisions that harm rather than help organizations. Throughput Accounting, therefore, removes standard cost accounting's reliance on efficiencies in general, and labor efficiency in particular, from management practice. Many cost and financial accountants agree with Goldratt's critique, but they have not agreed on a replacement of their own and there is enormous inertia in the installed base of people trained to work with existing practices.\n\nConstraints accounting, which is a development in the Throughput Accounting field, emphasizes the role of the constraint, (referred to as the Archemedian constraint) in decision making.\n\nGoldratt's alternative begins with the idea that each organization has a goal and that better decisions increase its value. The goal for a profit maximizing firm is stated as, increasing net profit now and in the future. Profit maximization seen from a Throughput Accounting viewpoint, is about maximizing a system's profit mix without Cost Accounting's traditional allocation of total costs. Throughput Accounting actions include obtaining the maximum net profit in the minimum time period, given limited resource capacities and capabilities. These resources include machines, capital (own or borrowed), people, processes, technology, time, materials, markets, etc. Throughput Accounting applies to not-for-profit organizations too, where they develop their goal that makes sense in their individual cases, and these goals are commonly measured in goal units.\n\nThroughput Accounting also pays particular attention to the concept of 'bottleneck' (referred to as \"constraint\" in the Theory of Constraints) in the manufacturing or servicing processes.\n\nThroughput Accounting uses three measures of income and expense: \n\n\nOrganizations that wish to increase their attainment of \"The Goal\" should therefore require managers to test proposed decisions against three questions. Will the proposed change:\n\n\nThe answers to these questions determine the effect of proposed changes on system wide measurements:\n\n\nThese relationships between financial ratios as illustrated by Goldratt are very similar to a set of relationships defined by DuPont and General Motors financial executive Donaldson Brown about 1920. Brown did not advocate changes in management accounting methods, but instead used the ratios to evaluate traditional financial accounting data.\n\nFor example: The railway coach company was offered a contract to make 15 open-topped streetcars each month, using a design that included ornate brass foundry work, but very little of the metalwork needed to produce a covered rail coach. The buyer offered to pay $280 per streetcar. The company had a firm order for 40 rail coaches each month for $350 per unit.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of Throughput Accounting is the relevance of the information it produces. Throughput Accounting reports what currently happens in business functions such as operations, distribution and marketing. It does not rely solely on GAAP's financial accounting reports (that still need to be verified by external auditors) and is thus relevant to current decisions made by management that affect the business now and in the future. Throughput Accounting is used in Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM), Drum Buffer Rope (DBR)—in businesses that are internally constrained, in Simplified Drum Buffer Rope (S-DBR) —in businesses that are externally constrained (particularly where the lack of customer orders denotes a market constraint), as well as in strategy, planning and tactics, etc.\n\n"}
{"id": "90473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90473", "title": "Wall Street Week", "text": "Wall Street Week\n\nWall Street Week with Maria Bartiromo (WSW), retitled in early 2018 as Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street, is an investment news and information TV program airing Friday nights on the Fox Business Network. The original weekly show hosted by Louis Rukeyser aired each Friday evening on PBS in the United States from 1970 to 2002. The program features a host (or hosts) and guest experts participating in discussions related to the financial markets.\n\nThe original show, which was created by Anne Truax Darlington and produced by Maryland Public Television (MPT), debuted on the entire PBS network on January 7, 1972 and was officially titled Wall $treet Week with Louis Rukeyser (W$W) during the 32 years he hosted from 1970 to 2002 (the \"S\" in \"Street\" was in the shape of a dollar sign).\n\nIn June 2002, the show was modified, dropping Rukeyser and changing the name to Wall Street Week with Fortune. Rukeyser went on to host \"Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street\" on CNBC (cancelled on December 31, 2004 at Rukeyser's request due to continuing ill health), which was also distributed to PBS stations. Wall Street Week with Fortune, which was hosted by Geoff Colvin and former Fox News business correspondent Karen Gibbs, ended its PBS run on June 24, 2005.\n\nWall Street Week was resurrected in April 2015 by SkyBridge Media LLC, an affiliated entity of global investment firm SkyBridge Capital, which was founded by financier and entrepreneur Anthony Scaramucci. The new \"Wall Street Week\" featured Anthony Scaramucci and Morgan Stanley senior advisor Gary Kaminsky as co-hosts. In March 2016, the show's licensing rights were picked up by Fox Broadcasting Company and it now airs Friday nights at 8 PM ET on the Fox Business Network. In April 2017, the show's name was changed to reflect Fox Business naming Maria Bartiromo as the new presenter. It was further changed in early 2018 to \"Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street.\"\n\nOver the years, the list of guests included such notables as Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Ross Perot, John Kenneth Galbraith, Malcolm Forbes, and Paul Samuelson. \n\nAfter being introduced, guests for the interview segment were escorted from backstage by a woman in formal dress dubbed by production staff and listed in the credits as \"Ms. Smythe\" (\"Miss Smythe\" until the late 1980s), always followed by her real name. Various women over the years performed this task, the most famous being Natalie Seltz.\n\nDuring Rukeyser's tenure, the program featured a distinctive theme composed by Donald Swartz entitled \"TWX in 12 Bars,\" which featured percussion supplied by a teletype machine. The opening bells of the song replicated the sound of the Westminster chimes.\n\nOn the last Friday of the year, the host and panelists would appear in black tie, make market predictions and stock recommendations for the upcoming year, and review how well their predictions of one year ago fared.\n\nOn October 23, 1987, the first program following Black Monday, the show dropped its regular format for a special program where Rukeyser interviewed three experts on the impact of the stock market crash.\n\nAfterwards, the show would employ this alternative format whenever events warranted, usually once every few months.\n\nWhenever Rukeyser was on vacation or otherwise absent, one of the show's regular panelists would fill in. For many years this function was usually performed by Carter Randall, though in later years it was usually Frank Cappiello or (less often) Martin Zweig after Randall died in 1999. Both Randall and Cappiello were investment bankers from Baltimore, convenient to where \"WSW\" was produced in Owings Mills, Maryland.\n\nDuring the 1984 and 1985 pledge-drive seasons, Rukeyser hosted two \"Investment Primer\" specials, introducing viewers to the stock market and how it worked. The first show, which aired in 1984, dealt with stocks, bonds, and gold; whereas the second show in 1985 dealt with mutual funds, options and commodities. Some of the guests included Stan Weinstein (editor of \"The Professional Tape Reader\"), Peter Lynch (manager of the Magellan funds at Fidelity Investments), and Dick Fabian (editor for \"The Telephone Switch Newsletter\")\n\nWith the new hosts came a change in format:\n\n\nThe new show's theme music was an updated, more orchestral version of \"TWX in 12 Bars\", produced again by Don Swartz and Don Barto.\n\nWithout Louis Rukeyser as host, this new version suffered from lower ratings, neither capturing a new more youthful market as PBS had intended, nor retaining the original viewers. It was canceled after three seasons.\n\nDuring its run, the show used two different indexes to predict future market trends:\n\nFrom 1970 to 1989, the show used the Wall Street Week Index (later known as the WSW Technical Market Index), a technical analysis developed by Robert Nurock. The analysis consisted of ten separate technical indicators, each of which was assigned a value of either +1 (indicating a bullish trend), -1 (for a bearish trend, or 0 (neutral)). A net balance of +5 (or higher) was interpreted as a buy signal, while a reading of -5 (or lower) was a sell signal. While the index rarely gave outright buy or sell signals, over time it was found to give an accurate forecast of the stock market. Rukeyser irreverently named the index \"The Elves\" (a reference to the Gnomes of Zürich), and dubbed Nurock the \"Chief Elf.\" After being in neutral for a considerable period of time, Rukeyser requested significant changes in the makeup of the index. Nurock refused since he believed his ten indicators were still the best way to judge the technical aspects of the market. This ended Nurock's association with the show and the Index was replaced.\n\nUsed From 1989 to the end of the Rukeyser era, the Elves Index was also a reading of ten indicators scored in the same manner as the Wall Street Week Index. Instead of reflecting technical factors, the indicators now represented the personal sentiment of ten market analysts about the direction of the market over the next three months. The Elves Index had more volatility and gave more buy and sell signals than the old Wall Street Week Index, but was not as highly regarded. In 1998, one magazine even suggested the Elves Index was more useful as a contrarian tool, citing three examples where buy signals were followed by periods of market drift or contraction. Later, Rukeyser added an Elves Index for the NASDAQ. This index had one of the worst predictive records of any public index.\n\nThe indexes were \"retired\" by Rukeyser after the September 11, 2001 attacks. At that point, the indexes were signalling a very strong sell signal. However, as was usually the case, it was an excellent time to do the opposite as the market rallied significantly after the initial selloff.\n\nThe premiere of \"WSW\" on November 20, 1970 was carried on eleven stations of the Eastern Educational Television Network. The show rapidly grew in coverage and viewers until it became one of the most popular programs on the newly created PBS member stations. At its peak in the 1980s, the program aired on over 300 stations, and claimed a viewership of 4,100,000 households, which meant more people watched \"WSW\" every week than read the \"Wall Street Journal\". The program became a major source of profit for both MPT and PBS through underwriting support and viewer pledges (it is estimated PBS earned $5,000,000 profit annually from the show).\n\nOver the years, stock traders and analysts noted that a company touted on \"WSW\" on Friday would experience a run-up in its stock price the following Monday. This phenomenon, dubbed \"The Rukeyser Effect\", was stated to be a further demonstration of the program's influence. However, in 1987, Prof. Robert Pari of Bentley College published an academic article in the \"Journal of Portfolio Management\" detailing the results of a study that found that stocks recommended by Rukeyser's guests on Wall Street Week not only tended to rise in price and trading volume in the days \"preceding\" the Friday evening broadcast, peaking on the Monday afterward, but thereafter those stocks tended to drop in price and under-perform the market for up to a year following the recommendation. Rukeyser strongly disputed this claim, but ten years later Professors Jess Beltz and Robert Jennings published another academic article in the \"Review of Financial Economics\" reporting results consistent with Pari's original findings, and that there was \"little correlation between the 6-month performance of a recommendation and the abnormal volume at the date the recommendation is made.\" They observed that there were differences in return performance between the recommendations of different individuals, but the market could not discern the more insightful recommendations from the less insightful. Another commentator observed \"It is mathematically impossible for the thirty million viewers of this show to beat the market, since they are the market.\"\n\nLouis Rukeyser conducted the proceedings with a wry sense of humor (including the use of puns) and a reassuring manner. In 1980 Rukeyser explained his hosting philosophy to \"The New York Times\" as, \"I am talking to one person, whom I regard as intelligent, with a good sense of humor, but not all that technically knowledgeable.\" He instructed panelists and guests not to use technical jargon and economic theories on the show, but rather talk about making money, because, \"Economics puts people to sleep. Money wakes them up.\"\n\nFrom its ratings peak in the early 1980s, \"WSW\" suffered a long steady decline in viewers due to competition from shows such as the \"Nightly Business Report\", cable programs like \"Moneyline\", and cable networks such as CNBC. By 2001 viewership was down to 1,500,000 households and demographics showed that the average \"WSW\" viewer was 65 years old (about the same age as Rukeyser). MPT began to discuss the possibility of updating the format in an effort to reverse these trends. On March 21, 2002, MPT announced that beginning in June the program would be renamed \"Wall Street Week with Fortune\", would be a collaboration between MPT and Fortune magazine, and would feature two new cohosts. Rukeyser was invited to remain with the program in a reduced role as a senior correspondent, but he turned down the offer.\n\nThe following evening, Rukeyser opened the telecast by announcing \"A funny thing happened to me on the way to the studio this week—I got ambushed.\" He criticized MPT's decision to change the show format, announced that he was developing a new business program for PBS, and concluded his commentary by asking viewers to write to their local PBS station and request it carry his new show. After the broadcast MPT dismissed Rukeyser and executive producer Rich Dubroff. Over the next three months Marshall Loeb and Ray Brady served as guest hosts while the new format was put in place.\n\nDespite \"ambushing\" Rukeyser, the show's trend of losing viewers continued as the show floundered on without Rukeyser's trusted presence and was terminated in early 2005. Rukeyser died 11 months after the show ended.\n\nIn May 2014, SkyBridge Capital acquired licensing rights to \"Wall Street Week\", creating a new entity, SkyBridge Media, for the purpose of re-launching the show.\n\nThe new \"Wall Street Week\" originally featured SkyBridge founder and managing partner Anthony Scaramucci and Morgan Stanley senior advisor Gary Kaminsky as hosts, and the format has been refreshed to maintain the spirit of the original show while modernizing certain aspects of the presentation. \n\nThe first episode of the new \"Wall Street Week\" aired April 19, 2015 and was streamed from its website, WallStreetWeek.com. Airtime for the show was purchased on television stations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. The first episode featured special guest \"bond king\" Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital and panelists Liz Ann Sonders (who was a frequent panelist on the original \"Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser\") of Charles Schwab and Jonathan Beinner of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Gundlach's commentary on the show, where he called for a potential crash in the junk bond market, made news across Wall Street following the premiere.\n\nThe show was picked up by Fox Business Network with its first episode airing there on March 18, 2016. Scaramucci stepped away from his position hosting the show after Donald Trump added him to his transition team as an economic advisor. Maria Bartiromo was named by Fox Business as the show's permanent anchor in April 2017. \n\nThe new program airs every Friday night at 8 PM ET on the Fox Business Network, with replays airing Friday nights at 8:30 PM ET, 12 and 12:30 AM ET, and Saturday and Sunday mornings at 9 & 9:30 AM ET. \n\nAgain, the opening bars (only) of \"TWX in 12 Bars\" is used for the opening, with a quote attributed to Rukeyser, “This show has never been solely about investments. We've talked about anything that affected people and their money,\" with both Scaramucci and Kaminsky featured in the opening.\n\nSometime in January 2018, the show's title was changed to \"Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street.\" The name change was implemented with little notice or fanfare by Fox Business, and no reason was announced for the change.\n\n"}

{"id": "8848387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8848387", "title": "Wang You-theng", "text": "Wang You-theng\n\nWang You-theng (; 5 March 1927 – 27 May 2016) was a Taiwanese entrepreneur, born in Changsha, Hunan, Republic of China, who founded the China Rebar Group and served as its chairman until fleeing Taiwan in late 2006 amid allegations of embezzlement and fraud.\n\nWang established the China Rebar Group in 1959 as a manufacturer of steel reinforcement beams. In the following years, Rebar expanded its operations from the construction industry into textiles, hotels, real estate, retail services, insurance, banking, and telecommunications. As the head of a growing business empire, Wang enjoyed a large personal fortune and increasing political clout. Several of Wang's children and relatives served as high-ranking officers in Rebar's subsidiary companies. As a tycoon, Wang maintained a close business relationship with government authorities over several administrations, serving as a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang for 15 years and being appointed as a National Policy Advisor to President Chen Shui-bian in 2000 when the Democratic Progressive Party won the ROC Presidential election that year.\n\nBy 2006, Rebar was encountering serious difficulties following years of allegedly hiding financial problems with bad loans from The Chinese Bank (a subsidiary) and falsified accounting records. On 29 December 2006, Rebar Asia-Pacific Group, along with three subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection, but did not notify the Taiwan Stock Exchange of their insolvency claims as required by regulations until 4 January 2007. During this week, several high-ranking officers in Rebar, including Wang, were alleged to have engaged in insider trading and embezzlement. Wang and his wife fled Taiwan for Hong Kong on 30 December, days before prosecutors began to launch an investigation into allegations of Rebar financial impropriety.\n\nIn the weeks following the break of the scandal, Wang and his wife moved to Shanghai. Public opinion in Taiwan was inflamed by reports of Wang's extravagant tastes and high living, as well as news that he had engaged in money laundering and discreetly transferred several assets abroad in prior years, suggesting that he had been planning his escape for some time. Despite several official attempts through the ROC's Mainland Affairs Council and other unofficial attempts, efforts to have the People's Republic of China return Wang back to Taiwan proved unsuccessful.\n\nOn 13 January, Wang and his wife left the PRC for the United States arriving at Los Angeles with Wang using his ROC passport with a B1 visa, and his wife entering using her US passport. Two days later, the Taipei Prosecutor's Office declared Wang a wanted fugitive, and his ROC passport was revoked by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). MOFA also contacted the US Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting assistance in having Wang extradited back to Taiwan. However, this proved to be difficult as the ROC's diplomatic isolation meant that it had few standing extradition agreements with other states, though US authorities did have an information sharing system in place which was used to coordinate efforts between the two sides.\n\nOn 31 January, the DOJ contacted Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) representatives in the US with information that Wang and his wife had left Los Angeles aboard Singapore Airlines Flight 27, with tickets for Myanmar with a stopover in Singapore. Wang was reportedly becoming nervous as US authorities were beginning to probe possible illegal transactions at the Rebar subsidiary OmniBank, based in the US. At this point, Wang was traveling on a Dominican passport, his ROC passport having been revoked in mid-January. Officials in Taipei immediately contacted Dominica and had Wang's Dominican passport revoked, effectively rendering him stateless. MOFA officials also contacted the Singapore government, requesting that Wang be extradited back to Taiwan, though again, the ROC and Singapore had no standing extradition agreement. Several agents from the Ministry of Justice Bureau of Investigation (BOI) were also dispatched to Singapore to intercept him at Singapore Changi Airport.\n\nArriving at Changi Airport the morning of 2 February, the couple were met at the gate by armed guards and denied entrance to Singapore. Singapore authorities and the BOI agents attempted to persuade the couple to board a Taiwan-bound flight. The couple refused and according to media reports, began sobbing and squatting on the floor, refusing to move. Due to the lack of an extradition agreement, neither the BOI agents or Singapore police were able to make an arrest. Attempts were made to place Wang on Singapore Airlines Flight 872, a return flight to the US with a transit at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, where he would be able to be detained upon entrance into the airport terminal. However upon learning of this, Wang and his wife still refused to board and as a result, delayed that flight for over three hours. After several more hours of screaming, crying, and yelling, the couple were permitted to return to the US via a direct flight.\n\nUpon arriving back at Los Angeles International Airport, Wang was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for attempting to enter the US without valid documentation, and was placed in the San Pedro Service Processing Center. You-theng was detained in the U.S. and wanted by Taiwanese prosecutors for allegedly embezzling NT$60 billion (US$1.8 billion) in corporate funds.\n\nWang reportedly died in an automobile accident in West Covina, California on 27 May 2016. His body has been cremated by family members and his ashes flown back to Taiwan.\n\nWang had four wives, six sons, and two daughters. \n"}
