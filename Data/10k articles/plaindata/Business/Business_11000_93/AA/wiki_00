He bought the \"Scots Magazine\" in 1801, and John Leyden, the orientalist, became its editor. In 1800 Constable began the \"Farmer's Magazine\", and in November 1802 he issued the first number of the \"Edinburgh Review\", under the nominal editorship of Sydney Smith; Lord Jeffrey, was, however, the guiding spirit of the review, having as his associates Lord Brougham, Sir Walter Scott, Henry Hallam, John Playfair and afterwards Lord Macaulay.\n\nConstable made a new departure in publishing by the generosity of his terms to authors. Writers for the \"Edinburgh Review\" were paid at an unprecedented rate, and Constable offered Scott 1000 guineas in advance for \"Marmion\". In 1804 A. G. Hunter joined Constable as partner, bringing considerable capital into the firm, styled from that time Archibald Constable & Co. In 1805, jointly with Longman & Co., Constable published Scott's \"Lay of the Last Minstrel\", and in 1807 \"Marmion\".\n\nIn 1808 a split took place between Constable and Sir Walter Scott, who transferred his business to the publishing firm of John Ballantyne & Co., for which he supplied most of the capital. In 1813, however, a reconciliation took place. Ballantyne was in difficulties, and Constable again became Scott's publisher, a condition being that the firm of John Ballantyne & Co. should be wound up at an early date, though Scott retained his interest in the printing business of James Ballantyne & Co.\n\nIn 1808 he served as Moderator of the High Constables of Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1812 Constable, who had admitted Robert Cathcart and Robert Cadell as partners on Hunter's retirement, purchased the copyright of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", adding the supplement (6 vols, 1816-1824) to the 4th, 5th and 6th editions. In 1814 he bought the copyright of \"Waverley\". This was issued anonymously; but in a short time 12,000 copies were disposed of, Scott's other novels following in quick succession. The firm also published the \"Annual Register\".\n\nThrough over-speculation, complications arose, and in 1826 a crash came. Constable's London agents stopped payment, and he failed for over £250,000, while James Ballantyne & Co. also went bankrupt for nearly £90,000. Sir Walter Scott was affected by the failure of both firms.\n\nConstable started business afresh, and began in 1827 \"Constable's Miscellany of Original and Selected Works\" consisting of a series of original works, and of standard books republished in a cheap form, thus making one of the earliest and most famous attempts to popularize high-quality literature. \nConstable died at home, 3 Park Place in Edinburgh, on 21 July 1827, but his firm survived, and the Constable publishing business continued in the twentieth century, issuing a wide range of fiction and non-fiction books. It continues today as Constable & Robinson.\n\nPark Place was a small square north of Geoge Square which was demolished later in the 19th century to build the new medical buildings for Edinburgh University.\n\nConstable was married to Mary Willison. They lived in Craigcrook House in western Edinburgh.\n\nTheir son, Thomas Constable FRSE (1812-1881) took over his printing business on his father's death. In 1839 he was appointed printer and publisher in Edinburgh to Queen Victoria, and issued, among other notable series, \"Constable's Educational Series\", and \"Constable's Foreign Miscellany\". In 1865 his son Archibald David Constable (died 1915) became a partner, and when Thomas retired in 1893 the firm continued under the name of T. & A. Constable.\n\nThomas married Lucia Anne Cowan, daughter of Alexander Cowan paper-maker (who clearly would have had business links with a major publishing firm such as Constables). They lived at 11 Thistle Street in Edinburgh's First New Town. Their son was also Archibald David Constable FRSE LLD (1843-1915), named after his grandfather, and followed in the family tradition as a printer.\n\nHis daughter, Elizabeth Constable (d.1818) married his junior publishing partner, Robert Cadell of Ratho.\n\n\nAttribution:\n\nPublished by Constable & Co.\n"}

Bush also hosted \"The Billy Bush Show\", a nationally syndicated talk and music radio show that aired from 2008 to 2014. He departed \"Access Hollywood\" in 2016 after being named a co-host in the third hour of \"Today\". In October 2016, during the presidential election, he became the subject of controversy when the 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" recording surfaced of him and presidential candidate Donald Trump having a lewd conversation. Due to this incident, Bush was fired from \"Today\".\n\nWilliam Hall Bush was born in Manhattan, New York, to Josephine Colwell Bush (née Bradley) and Jonathan Bush, a banker. William Bush's uncle (his father's older brother) is George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. George W. Bush, the 43rd President, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush are William Bush's first cousins.\n\nBush attended middle school at St. Bernard's School in Manhattan and high school at St. George's School in Middletown, Rhode Island. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in international studies and government from Colby College in 1994. He was also a four-year letterman and a two-time co-captain as a junior and senior with the Mules' men's lacrosse team. As of 2017, he is 4th (182), 8th (97), and 4th (85) in career points, goals and assists respectively in program history and was a first-team All-NESCAC in 1994.\n\nBush began his career hosting the afternoon drive show on WLKZ-FM in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, later moving to Washington, D.C., where he hosted the midday show on WARW-FM. In March 1997, Bush joined WWZZ-FM (Z104) in D.C. as host of \"Billy Bush and the Bush League Morning Show\", which aired until January 2001.\n\nIn January 2003, Bush hosted a short-lived NBC prime-time version of \"Let's Make a Deal\". He was also a correspondent for WNBC-TV's \"Today in New York\" morning show.\n\nBush joined \"Access Hollywood\", a daily entertainment news magazine, as East Coast correspondent in December 2001. He was promoted to co-anchor in June 2004.\n\nWhile working at \"Access Hollywood\", he was present at high-profile red carpet events including the Golden Globes, Grammys, and Academy Awards, and hosted ABC's live pre-show for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 Academy Awards and the \"2006 Emmy Red Carpet Special\".\n\nBush was a reporter for NBC at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and was the host for \"Access Hollywood's\" coverage of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino as well as the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In addition, Bush hosted the reality competition \"\" on NBC in 2007, and stood in for Meredith Vieira for a week of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" shows on April 21–25, 2008. He and Vieira both had credited cameos as hosts of fictional game shows in the 2004 remake of Ira Levin's 1972 satirical thriller \"The Stepford Wives\".\n\nHe returned to radio with \"The Billy Bush Show\", a nightly talk radio and entertainment interview show. It airs from KBIG in Los Angeles and is syndicated by Westwood One. The show is written by Ryan Miller and produced by Corrin Barlow, while Bush and \"Access Hollywood\" executive producer Rob Silverstein are the show's executive producers. The show, which airs evenings Monday through Friday, focuses on the top entertainment stories and personalities in the news, and features celebrity guests and listener calls.\n\nBush co-hosted the Miss Universe pageant four times: in 2003 and 2004 with Daisy Fuentes; in 2005 with fellow \"Access Hollywood\" co-anchor Nancy O'Dell; and in 2009 with Claudia Jordan. He has also co-hosted the Miss USA pageant four times, with almost the same partners: in 2003 with Fuentes; 2004 and 2005 with O'Dell; and again in 2009, this time with Nadine Velazquez. After the 65th Annual Golden Globe Awards of 2008 were cancelled as a result of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, Bush co-hosted the 65th Annual Golden Globe Awards Announcement press conference with O'Dell on January 13, 2008.\n\nBush was named one of \"Esquire\" magazine's \"10 Men\" in July 2005. \"He's a furious, inventive interviewer, unafraid of playing the fool in exchange for a true reaction\", opined the writer of the accompanying magazine profile.\n\nFrom September 13, 2010, to October 2016, Bush co-hosted the syndicated national daily entertainment talk show \"Access Hollywood Live\", along with co-host Kit Hoover. This show is a sister show of \"Access Hollywood\", with host chat of popular topics and celebrity live interviews. Bush and Hoover traveled together to the UK to cover Prince William's wedding to Catherine Middleton, as part of the NBC team coverage.\n\nBush played the drill sergeant in the 2010 film \"Furry Vengeance\" and had a small role as the voice of a newscaster in the 2014 Disney animated film \"Big Hero 6\". He has also had several appearances on television shows including \"30 Rock\" and \"Donny!\".\n\nIn May 2016, Bush was selected to be the co-host of the third hour of NBC's \"Today\". He served as a replacement for Willie Geist.\n\nBush was the first reporter to interview American Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte after the athlete claimed he was robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro during the 2016 Summer Olympics. Bush's due diligence as an interviewer was scrutinized after critics claimed Bush did not ask questions that would have shown Lochte’s story was fabricated. When details of Lochte's story began to fall apart, Matt Lauer re-interviewed the swimmer in a move that was seen as a snub to Bush. Bush garnered attention once again after he and Al Roker got into an argument during Olympic coverage on \"Today\" after Lochte was exposed. Bush defended Lochte, saying he lied about \"some\" details whereas Roker characterized Lochte's statement as a lie.\n\nOn October 7, 2016, \"The Washington Post\" reported that video footage was released of Donald Trump having a lewd conversation with Bush, with Trump either unaware or unconcerned that his microphone was active. Bush is heard laughing about Trump's failed effort to seduce a married woman, and joining in by commenting on actress Arianne Zucker's appearance, calling her \"hot as shit.\" The video was made on the NBC Studios lot in the course of videotaping an \"Access Hollywood\" episode in mid-September 2005, promoting Trump's cameo appearance in an episode of daytime soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\" to promote \"The Apprentice\".\n\nIn the video, Trump discussed a failed attempt to seduce Bush's then-co-host Nancy O'Dell: \"I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married.\" He also talked about stars groping women: \"...you just kiss...when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything [Bush: Anything you want]...grab them by the pussy...\"\n\nWhen the news of the footage first broke, Bush was at New York's JFK International Airport waiting to take off for Los Angeles. He spent the six-hour flight reading news reports on the unfolding controversy. By the time he arrived in Los Angeles, a horde of paparazzi had materialized at Los Angeles International Airport and at his home in Los Angeles, where they remained for more than a week. Bush spent the remainder of that weekend trying to save his job at \"Today\", which had already garnered controversy, first over Bush's lack of hard-news experience and the rude tone he exhibited during red carpet events and then over the Ryan Lochte matter. Initially, NBC News signaled Bush would return that Monday to apologize on-air. Bush later stated, \"I would have welcomed addressing the audience.\"\n\nHowever, Bush received criticism online and calls for his resignation from the show, with \"The Washington Post\" stating, \"Bush's public image was damaged—perhaps beyond repair.\" He issued an apology, stating: \"Obviously I'm embarrassed and ashamed. It's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago. I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry.\" Bush was 33 years old at the time the video was made. On October 9, 2016, NBC announced that Bush was suspended from \"Today\" for his role in the 2005 video. He was suspended pending an internal review. By October 17, Bush had been fired.\n\nAfter \"The New York Times\" reported in late November 2017 that Trump had privately told people, including a sitting senator, that the voice on the tape was not his, Bush published an op-ed in the paper on December 3, reaffirming that the voice in the tape was the president's and accusing him of engaging in revisionist history.\n\nHe married Sydney Davis in April 1998 and the couple has three daughters: Josephine, Mary and Lillie. On September 19, 2017, the couple announced they were separating.\n\nOn November 27, 2017, Bush was hospitalized after being hit in the head by a golf ball.\n\nOn July 15, 2018, Billy and his wife Sydney announced their divorce due to irreconcilable differences.\n"}
{"id": "9131405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9131405", "title": "Black capitalism", "text": "Black capitalism\n\nBlack capitalism is a political movement among African Americans, seeking to build wealth through the ownership and development of businesses. Black capitalism has traditionally focused on African-American businesses, although some critics and activists have also pushed for increased representation of Blacks in corporate America.\n\nRoots of black capitalism can be found in the lives of \"Free Negroes\" during times of the American Enslavement. Many records exist reporting the development of economic wealth by these \"Free Negroes\".\n\nThe earliest recorded words touting the economic upliftment of African Americans by an African American was written by Lewis Woodson under the pen name \"Augustine\" in the \"Coloured American\" newspaper. Woodson helped found Wilberforce University and the first AME Theological seminary, Payne Theological Seminary and was an early teacher and mentor of Martin Delany.\n\nA prominent southern affluent black was A. G. Gaston who was, at times, instrumental in the civil rights movement. Galston was influenced by Booker T. Washington, who was an early leader at the Tuskegee Institute. Another wealthy African American was Robert Reed Church, who founded the nation's first black-owned bank, Solvent Savings, in 1906.\n\nThere are many historical and current examples of neighborhoods of prominent and affluent blacks in American history. Some include the historical Highland Beach, Maryland and more recently Mount Airy in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Prince George's County, Maryland and DeKalb County, Georgia. Mainstream media identifies this with some interest.\n\nA more focused movement of black capitalism can be found in the popular magazine \"Black Enterprise\".\n\nThere are two strands of black capitalism: the one focuses on success as a group, while the other focuses on success as an individual.\n\nOne strain of black capitalism is immersed in the ethic of African Americans building wealth together, as exemplified in the Kwanzaa value of \"ujamaa\" meaning 'cooperative economics'. A prominent proponent and example of this cooperative economics is Russell Simmons who can be seen advocating the building of not only individual black businesses but communities of black businesses. Simmons has made the comment that black MBA students and graduates have the notion that they want to own their own businesses, not to simply be employed in someone else's business.\n\nA recent effort to standardize black capitalism as a movement was introduced in two books: \"Black Labor: White Wealth\" and the more recent book \"Powernomics\" by Dr Claud Anderson. In these two books Dr. Anderson outlines a schema on which black wealth can be coordinated and developed through a nine-issue plan.\n\nSome see this group success strain of black capitalism as a form of Social entrepreneurship which aims to build businesses that are oriented around providing services and goods that benefit the community in which they were built. Others see this as an outgrowth of the communal and tribal ethic attributed to traditional African cultures.\n\nBlack Capitalism over the last thirty years has been driven to the forefront by entertainment. Yet the question as posed in an article on Huffington Post by Antonio Moore \"The Decadent Veil: Black America's Wealth Illusion\" questions are rising is this type of limited approach a help. \"As black celebrity has been shown to millions of people, millions of times, the story of real lives has also been lost, and with it the engine that thrust forward the demand for social justice by the masses. The heartbeat of social action is to recognize your mistreatment, and demand better. With each presentation of Kobe Bryant's 25 million dollar a year contract, or Oprah's status as the sole African American billionaire a veil of false calm is created within the overall American economic psyche about the immense black wealth disparity.\"\n\nA parallel, but possibly opposing, strain of black capitalism stems from the American ideal of building individual wealth. Prominent examples of this can be popular figures such as Oprah Winfrey and Robert L. Johnson. The complaint leveled against the adherents of individual success from advocates of group success is that individually wealthy African Americans have made millions of dollars and that that in and of itself has made very little contribution to the plight of African Americans in general.\n\nIn general, African Americans and the media sometimes point to this phenomenon as \"black flight\" or \"selling out\" where affluent blacks move out of predominantly black neighborhoods into affluent white neighborhoods. A history of some of this is documented in the book \"Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class\" by Otis Graham.\n\nThe notion of racial integration is such that African Americans should be able to move and operate in a predominately white society safely. This effort at racial integration concerns mostly public spaces and private hiring practices. It is thought that attempts and movements supporting racial integration are efforts to enable blacks to assimilate into white institutions.\n\nBlack capitalism is an effort to position blacks as the owners of land, the means of production, and businesses that own either or both. The aim of black capitalism is to bolster self-reliance, both individually and communally.\n\nThere are also two strands of thinking in African America, and specifically Black Nationalism, that is against capitalism as an economic system in all of its forms. One strand is against capitalism on the basis of the historical treatment of Africans and the African Diaspora, i.e. slavery, subjugation, and colonization. Another strand is against capitalism through strict political critiques, i.e. socialist. Many critics of capitalism from within the black community blend the two positions, however the reasoning behind them are distinct. A prominent black political critic was C. L. R. James. Two of the most popular black anti-capitalist books are \"How Europe Underdeveloped Africa\" by Walter Rodney and \"How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America\" by Manning Marable. These books give analysis on how capitalism as an economic system has not raised the quality of living for the African Diaspora.\n\nExamples of the explicit and public opposition to African American economic success have diminished since the Civil Rights movement. However, before this period of American transition, there are a few notable violent attacks against prosperous African American communities including the Tulsa Race Riot and the Rosewood massacre.\n\nBlacks on average have a lower net worth than whites in America. This is especially pertinent in the creation of new businesses. One of the most common forms of collateral for loans to open businesses is home equity. With the historical and current differences in lending patterns toward blacks and whites, the option of using home equity to borrow against in order to open a business is diminished.\n\nThe article \"America's Financial Divide\" added context to racial wealth inequality, stating\n...nearly 96.1 percent of the 1.2 million households in the top one percent by income were white, a total of about 1,150,000 households. In addition, these families were found to have a median net asset worth of . In stark contrast, in the same piece black households were shown as a mere 1.4 percent of the top one percent by income, that's only 16,800 homes. In addition, their median net asset worth was just . Using this data as an indicator only about 8,400 of the over 14 million African American households have more than in net assets...Relying on data from Credit Suisse and Brandeis University's Institute on Assets and Social Policy, the Harvard Business Review in the article \"How America's Wealthiest Black Families Invest Money\" recently took the analysis above a step further. In the piece the author stated \"If you're white and have a net worth of about $356,000, that's good enough to put you in the 72nd percentile of white families. If you're black, it's good enough to catapult you into the 95th percentile.\" This means 28 percent of the total 83 million white homes, or over 23 million white households, have more than $356,000 in net assets. While only 700,000 of the 14 million black homes have more than $356,000 in total net worth.\n\n\n\n"}

The earliest use of the term business guru can be tracked back to the 1960s being used in \"Business Week\". There are no existing qualifications that make someone a business guru. The lists of people who have been accepted as business gurus have constantly changed over time. However, there are some people who have been accepted by a great majority as a business guru and also some organizations which have created their own lists of gurus. One English writer has described management gurus as \"overwhelmingly a US phenomenon.\"\n\nThere is no definitive list of business gurus, but some writers have proposed \"personal\" lists. These lists are mostly created by organizations such as business magazines or management writers. There have been many business guru lists created through history.\n\nA list consisting of people who are included in almost all of the lists created, collectively known as the \"Famous Five\", are: Frederick Winslow Taylor, Michael Porter, Alfred Sloan, Peter Drucker, and Douglas McGregor.\n\nIn 2001, \"Harvard Business Review\" asked the gurus to name their favorite gurus. The people named were Peter Drucker, James March and Herbert Simon.\n\nAnother list includes Peter Drucker, Michael Porter, and Tom Peters as the three leading gurus of our time.\n\nThere are also many gurus who have emerged and disappeared through history. For example, the Japanese were known for making improvements to the business world and bringing out gurus in the 1980s, which included Keniche Ohmae and Akio Morita. Then European gurus emerged, which included Yves Doz, Geert Hofstede, Manfred Kets De Vries and Charles Handy.\n\nOne management expert, Gary Hamel, says there have been \"few genuine breakthroughs\" since the work of Taylor and Max Weber. In his book, Hamel says that management is \"stuck in a time warp.\" Similarly, even one of the authors of a book about management gurus warns that management theory is \"not served well by fads,\" citing Enron as a \"management fad for its supposed culture of innovation.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "4866034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4866034", "title": "Certified General Accountants Association of Canada", "text": "Certified General Accountants Association of Canada\n\nFounded in 1908, the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada (CGA-Canada) serves Certified General Accountants and students in Canada and nearly 100 countries. CGA-Canada established the designation's certification requirements and professional standards, offers professional development, conducts research and advocacy, and represents CGAs nationally and internationally. CGA-Canada is working with the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) to integrate operations under the CPA banner in 2014. CPA Canada is the new national accounting body formed by the merger of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) and the Society of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) in 2013.\n\nIn October 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 CGA-Canada was named one of \"Canada's Top 100 Employers\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., CGA-Canada has also been named one of \"BC's Top Employers\" and one of \"Canada's Greenest Employers\".\n\nThe national association, first known as the Canadian Accountants' Association, was founded in 1908 by a trio of Canadian Pacific Railway accountants in Montreal, Quebec. Five years later, in 1913, the General Accountants' Association, as it was then known, was granted a charter from the government of Canada. By the mid-1940s, association chapters were established from coast-to-coast. Provincial, territorial and regional (offshore) chapters were later established under their own charters.\n\nAuditing rights are regulated by provincial governments. In Prince Edward Island, only qualified CAs and CGAs can perform public accounting and auditing in accordance with the Public Accounting and Auditing Act. In all other provinces, except Quebec and Ontario (detailed below), only qualified CAs, CGAs, and CMAs (Certified Management Accountants) may audit public companies.\n\n\nHistorically Quebec and Ontario only allowed CAs to audit public companies. In 2004, the Ontario government passed legislation that would enable CAs, CGAs and CMAs to practice public accounting under a reconstituted Public Accountants Council, and as of June 2010 Ontario CGAs were allowed to issue audit opinions.\n\nIn August 2005, a panel was constituted under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT) to rule on a challenge filed by CGA New Brunswick and CGA-Canada. It found Quebec's measures denying CGAs the right to practice public accounting in Quebec to impair trade and recommended legislative changes. The Quebec government committed to address the problem. By November 2009, the 'Regulation respecting the public accountancy permit of the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités du Québec' enabled qualified CGAs to offer the full range of public accounting services to for-profit and publicly listed companies.\n\nOn November 6, 2009, Ontario issued a Notice of Measure claiming that material differences exist in respect of the practice of public accounting in Canada and to protect consumers out of province public accountants would be assessed against Ontario's requirements. Manitoba supported by Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan objected on the grounds that the Ontario regime causes injury to CGAs and impairs internal trade. A Panel convened under the Agreement on Internal Trade reviewed submissions and held a public hearing in Toronto on November 29, 2011. The Panel found that Ontario's notice of measure has impaired or would impair internal trade and has caused or would cause injury. The Panel recommended that Ontario comply with its AIT obligations by April 15, 2012. The outcome is important for CGAs because it removes the last barrier to mobility, allowing CGAs to practice anywhere in Canada.\n\nIn November 2008, Dr. Catherine Boivie was appointed to the Board of Directors as the Public Representative. Based in British Columbia, Dr. Boivie is the chief executive officer of Inventure Solutions and senior vice-president of information technology (IT) and facilities at Vancity, Canada's largest credit union.\n\nIn October 2013, CGA-Canada entered into an Integration Agreement with CPA Canada, the body responsible for the new national designation Chartered Professional Accountant. This followed most provincial CGA bodies ratifying the unification of the accounting profession in Canada.\n\nCGA-Canada's professional education program is competency-based. Competency-based education requires candidates to perform tasks and roles to standards expected in the workplace.\n\nThe knowledge, skills and professional values required of a CGA are reflected in a list of competencies. These competencies extend over three areas: professionalism, leadership and professional knowledge. They are validated periodically through extensive survey analysis. The CGA Competency Framework details the 130 competencies required of a newly certified CGA.\n\nThe complete academic program consists of 19 courses, two business cases, and professional qualification exams, spread over several levels: Levels 1 to 3 (Foundation Studies), Level 4 (Advanced Studies), and final level, the PACE qualification or certification level.\n\nA CGA must have an undergraduate degree. Students normally require 36 months of supervised work experiences, but in all cases they require a minimum of 24 months. They may meet the experience requirements in any business sector and in a variety of fields.\n\nBefore issuing audit opinions a CGA must first be licensed as a public accountant. The requirements for licensing include at least 500 public accounting hours per year.\n\nCGA is recognized in 170+ countries through their partnership with ACCA.\n\nCGA-Canada has been providing online professional accounting education. Via the Internet, students can complete their studies using a system that integrates text material, study guides, video and audio tools, discussion forums, group case study and project work, web research and email.\n\nIntroduced in 2011, Professional Experience Required for Certification (PERC) is the national reporting process for students in the CGA program. With PERC, students can document their experiences online and submit it annually.\n\nIn addition to its own online program of studies, CGA-Canada has also developed online degree partnerships with several Canadian universities.\n\nCGA-Canada develops research and supports positions with a view to influence social policy, regulation and standards-setting.\n\nThis initiative has resulted in the following research items. \n\n\nIn December 2006, CGA-Canada and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) announced a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) to take effect on 1 January 2007. This agreement was renewed in 2011.\n\nIn April 2008, CGA-Canada and CPA Australia entered into a MRA to extend the global reach of both organizations into new continents. \n\nIn June 2009, CGA-Canada and CPA Ireland entered into a mutual recognition agreement. The MRA establishes a strategic partnership between the two leading accounting organizations and gives members the opportunity to qualify for another designation. \n\nIn June 2010, CGA-Canada and the Ordre des Experts-Comptables, France's foremost accounting organization, have entered into a MRA. Under this accord, CGAs and members of the CSOEC can be considered for membership by the other body. \n\nThe association is a member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).\n\nCGA-Canada is an affiliate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean and is a member of the International Federation of Francophone Accountants (FIDEF).\n\n\n"}

Located on Church Street between Chambers and Cortlandt Streets in Lower Manhattan, it is served by the:\n\nThe station also connects to the PATH via the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, which links this station with the nearby Fulton Center.\n\nChambers Street–World Trade Center on the IND Eighth Avenue Line is an express station with four tracks and two island platforms, but in an unusual layout: the station has separate island platforms for express and local trains. Both island platforms can accommodate trains. There is a passenger connection between the two platforms at mezzanine level. This passageway also includes the in-system transfer to the IRT station. Both platforms opened just after midnight on September 10, 1932, as did the rest of the IND Eighth Avenue Line north to Inwood–207th Street.\n\nA late-1990s renovation saw prefabricated tile panels installed on the trackside wall of the express platform, with a tile band of Concord Violet bordered in black and \"CHAMBERS\" in white Copperplate lettering on black tiles on each panel, and on the local platform's walls the new tiles were installed in 3-foot by 2-foot sections with a slightly different shade of dark blue violet bordered in black; no station name captions were placed. The trim lines in the entryways and passages use the Concord Violet color rather than the blue violet.\n\nChambers Street, the express platform, is a through station. Just north of Chambers Street station is a third track between the uptown and downtown express tracks, with connecting switches at both ends, which was used to turn trains when Chambers Street was used as a terminal, before the Broadway–Nassau Street (now Fulton Street) station opened on February 1, 1933. It is served by the ' and ' trains. This platform is not wheelchair-accessible, although it can possibly gain accessibility in the future because the elevator to the local platform leads to the mezzanine that is shared with this station. However, it is one block away from the Chambers Street station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which is wheelchair-accessible.\n\nWorld Trade Center, the local platform, forms the terminus of the local service and is offset to the south of the express platform, at the northern edge of the World Trade Center site. It is served by the train. Southbound local trains reach the platform by ramping underneath the express tracks south of Canal Street station. The northern end of the World Trade Center station has a signal tower and a diamond crossover switch that are roughly at the middle of the through-platform.\n\nThe local tracks end at bumper blocks at the south end of the platform. In addition, there is a platform-level passageway on the western side of the station toward the platform's south end, evidence of a former half-length side platform for the western track; while in passenger use as a connection to the rest of the station, the former platform is now fenced off from the rest of the local platform level, and passengers must now use the mezzanine to access the island platform. A connection to the World Trade Center PATH station is also available at the station's south end; this, in turn, gives access to the Fulton Center (via the Dey Street Passageway), the Cortlandt Street station of the BMT Broadway Line, and the WTC Cortlandt Street station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. Another passageway also leads directly to the southbound BMT Broadway Line platform.\n\nThe station was formerly named Hudson Terminal or H&M, after the nearby Hudson Terminal of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (now the PATH). Since 1973, this station has been named after the two World Trade Centers. Wall tiles reading \"H M\" remained on the walls of the World Trade Center station as late as December 1974, a year after the first World Trade Center was completed. The tiles were initially painted over, but since the station's renovation, they have been covered over.\n\nAt the extreme southern end of the station is the exit to the Cortlandt Street station, along with a few High Entrance-Exit Turnstiles (HEETs). Only this platform was ADA-accessible, and currently, only this platform is ADA-accessible. The doors and original ADA-accessible ramp, as well as the structure from the first World Trade Center leading into the station, survived the September 11 attacks. The station itself was not damaged, but it was covered by dust and was subsequently closed. The passageway reopened for a while to provide an ADA-connection from the New York City Subway station to the temporary World Trade Center PATH station, but was closed again when the temporary PATH station closed for a reconstruction. The passageway was then covered in plywood for preservation purposes.\n\nThe renovated entrance, leading from the New York City Subway station to the newly rebuilt PATH station's Oculus headhouse as well as to the Westfield World Trade Center, opened on December 19, 2016. The newly reopened passageway retained its pre-9/11 design, save for a door on display that has the words \"MATF 1 / 9 13\" spray-painted on it (a message from Urban Search and Rescue Massachusetts Task Force 1 of Beverly, Massachusetts, who searched the World Trade Center site on September 13, 2001). There is a plaque above the spray-painting, explaining the message on the door. PATH was required to preserve the passageway's original design as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as a condition for getting funding to construct the Oculus and new stations. The passageway was not be made ADA-accessible again until 2017, as there are twenty-six steps down from the mezzanine to the Oculus headhouse's lobby. The World Trade Center platform is ADA accessible as of December 31, 2017, via this passageway as well as a side entrance to the Oculus headhouse.\n\nThe MTA's elevator to the local platform, at the southeast corner of Church Street and Park Place, connects to the local platform via a long ramp from the main mezzanine shared with Chambers Street, but it has been out of service from 2001 to 2017 due to long-term construction on the current World Trade Center. The elevator was planned to reopen in December 2017.\n\nExits/entrances through turnstiles to Church Street are located in the mezzanine of this station, along with a few High Entrance-Exit Turnstiles (HEETs). There are street stairs:\n\nThere is also a passageway to the PATH station at the very southern end of the local platform (see ).\n\nThe only transfer between the local platform and the express platform is available only at the very tips of both platforms, where the two platforms are opposite each other for a few feet. Passengers must walk down the express platform to the southernmost staircase, go up to a different part of the mezzanine, crossover, and then go down a staircase to the northern end of the local platform. This complex transfer is to allow a continued underground mezzanine outside of fare control from the southern end at the World Trade Center, which is just one block west of the Fulton Street station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, to the most northern street stairs at Chambers and Church Street, which is just one block east of the Chambers Street station of the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. The total length of the mezzanine is seven blocks.\n\nThe station has been portrayed in a variety of ways on New York City Subway maps since 1932. Originally, it was shown as a single station called Chambers Street–Hudson Terminal. Starting in about 1948, two stations were shown, Chambers Street–Hudson Terminal for the express trains continuing to Brooklyn, and Hudson Terminal for the local trains terminating at the station. A 1959 map showed two stations enclosed in a box, but a single label. The 1964 and 1966 maps were similar.\n\nOn the 1972 map, it once again appeared to be a single station, with the label showing Chambers Street, Hudson Terminal, World Trade Center, and PATH, although the Hudson Terminal office building complex had already been demolished by this time.\n\nOn the current map published by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, it is shown as two separate stations with a free transfer—Chambers Street (served by A and C trains) and World Trade Center (served by E trains). Signs in the Fulton Center only show the E when pointing toward the World Trade Center station, as the A, C, 2 and 3 trains serve both station complexes.\n\nAround 2:00 p.m. on January 23, 2005, a fire destroyed the interlocking plant at Chambers Street. As a result, two-thirds of A trains were canceled or rerouted, including all rush-hour trips to Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street. C service was completely suspended and replaced by the A and V in Brooklyn and A, B, D, and E in Manhattan. Some newspaper articles blamed the fire on a homeless person trying to keep warm, but that was never confirmed. Until January 28, the MTA rerouted the A to the connected IND Sixth Avenue Line, Rutgers Street Tunnel, and IND Culver Line (the route used by regular F service) from West Fourth Street to Jay Street between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., in order to perform critical repairs.\n\nInitial estimates gave a time of three to five years to restore full service because the destroyed equipment was custom-made for the MTA. That was later cut back to six to nine months to bring back normal operations. However, C service and 70% of A service was restored at 5 a.m. on February 2, 2005, only ten days after the fire. The rush-hour A trips were restored on February 14. On April 21, full service was restored. However, effects of the fire continued into 2006 because the equipment had not been replaced.\n\nThe Park Place station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line was built on the portion of the line built as part of the Dual Contracts, which is the section south of Times Square–42nd Street. The line first opened as a shuttle to 34th Street–Penn Station on June 3, 1917, and then south to South Ferry on July 1, 1918. On this same date, the Fulton Street station opened, with service to the station running as a shuttle between Chambers Street and Wall Street, on the line's Brooklyn Branch. On August 1, 1918, the new \"H\" system was implemented on August 1, 1918, joining the two halves of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and sending all West Side trains south from Times Square. As a result, shuttle service to this station was replaced by through service.\n\nDuring the 1964–1965 fiscal year, the platforms at Park Place, along with those at four other stations on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, were lengthened to 525 feet to accommodate a ten-car train of 51-foot IRT cars.\n\nIt has two tracks and a single island platform with a line of blue i-beam columns with alternating ones having the standard black name plate in white lettering. Both track walls have a mostly gold trim line along with the \"P\" tablets at regular intervals.\n\nNorthwest (railroad north) of the station, the tracks of this station become the express tracks of the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, curving sharply northeast under West Broadway. The station is very close to the next stop north, Chambers Street at West Broadway, and the northernmost entrances of this station at Church and Chambers Streets are less than from the entrances to the station at Chambers Street and West Broadway.\n\nThe station has a mezzanine at each end. Towards the western end of the platform, two long staircases lead up to an intermediate landing where another, shorter staircase leads up to the main IND mezzanine near the full \"Oculus\" mosaic. From here, there is a bank of turnstiles leading to the street stair that goes to the northwest corner of Park Place and Church Street. A staircase in this mezzanine leads down to the very southern end of the IND express platform, where transfer to the local platform is via another set of stairs.\n\nThe IRT platform has its own entrance/exit at its extreme eastern (railroad south) end. Here, a staircase and two escalators, none of which are together, lead up to a mezzanine just beneath the street. The staircase splits into two separate staircases at an initial landing and each of those have another intermediate landing. On this mezzanine, there are turnstiles, both regular and HEET (from when the mezzanine had a part-time token booth and the regular turnstiles could not be left unstaffed). A single street stair leads out to the northwest corner of Broadway and Park Place. The signage for this entrance is the only one in the complex that says \"Park Place\" with bullets only for the 2 and 3 trains. This stair is very close to the BMT Broadway Line's City Hall station, an entrance to which is about away, on the other side of Broadway. A short staircase in that mezzanine once led to an entrance to the lobby of the Woolworth Building. It has been closed since the September 11 attacks.\n\nCortlandt Street is a local station on the BMT Broadway Line. Originally opened in 1918, the station is located under Church Street, between Fulton and Cortlandt Streets.\n\nThis underground station, opened on January 5, 1918, has two tracks and two side platforms. It is the closest station on the BMT Broadway Line to the World Trade Center. Immediately north of this station, the line utilizes a sharp reverse curve, first turning east under Vesey Street, then turning north under Broadway toward City Hall.\n\nPassageways link this station to three others outside fare control: the World Trade Center PATH station, the WTC Cortlandt station, and the Fulton Street station, all through the Dey Street Passageway underneath the station. The station also contains a free transfer to the Chambers Street–World Trade Center and Park Place stations via the southbound platform.\n\nBoth eastern corner of Church and Dey Streets contain a staircase exit from the northbound platform. There is also a staircase to the northeast corner of Church and Cortlandt Streets.\n\nBoth platforms are connected to the World Trade Center Transportation Hub via an underpass and to the Fulton Center via the Dey Street Passageway. This station is ADA-accessible via the latter connection. An underground passageway also leads to One Liberty Plaza. An exit at the north end of the southbound platform once led to the original World Trade Center's lower concourse, and now leads to the Westfield World Trade Center shopping mall within the WTC Transportation Hub. A passageway at the north end of the southbound platform also leads to the World Trade Center subway station. The connection opened on December 29, 2017 along with a passageway connecting World Trade Center with Tower 2, and passageways connecting the southbound platform of Cortlandt Street to the Oculus and to Tower 4. Fare control areas had to be reconfigured.\n\nThe station was overhauled in the late 1970s, with repairs made to the structural and cosmetic appearance. The original BMT wall tiles were removed and the \"new\" station walls contained cinderblock tiles (colored white with small recesses painted yellow), with black and white station-name signs bolted into the recesses. Lighting was converted from incandescent to fluorescent and staircases and platform edges were repaired. \n\nMuch of the cosmetic change that came with this renovation was undone in a subsequent 1998–1999 renovation. In addition to \"state-of-repair\" work and upgrades for ADA accessibility, the station's original 1918 tilework was restored. Other improvements were made to the public address system, directional signage, and concrete trackbeds.\n\nThe station sustained significant damage during the collapse of the adjacent World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001. It was closed for repairs, which included removal of debris, fixing structural damage, and restoring the track beds, which had suffered flood damage in the aftermath of the collapse. The station reopened on September 15, 2002.\n\nOn August 20, 2005, the station was closed again for installation of the Dey Street Passageway below Dey Street as part of the Fulton Center project. At the same time, the station is to be made ADA-accessible in both directions. Previously, the station was accessible on the southbound side only via the temporary PATH World Trade Center station's elevator. MTA posters and flyers at that time indicated the station would reopen in the spring of 2006, and later by spring of 2007, but neither reopening schedules occurred. The northbound side of the station finally reopened on November 25, 2009. The southbound platform reopened on September 6, 2011, while continuing excavation along the Church Street side of the World Trade Center site was being performed.\n\nThe Dey Street Passageway, outside of the fare control, connects the Fulton Street station complex to the Cortlandt Street station and to the World Trade Center Transportation Hub. It opened on November 10, 2014, while the World Trade Center was still under construction. With the opening of the Dey Street Passageway, ridership at the station has increased dramatically. Between 2014 and 2016, ridership at the station increased from 1,500,040 to 4,270,036, a 184 percent increase.\n\nThere are over 300 mosaics dispersed throughout the IND and IRT stations, which are part of the 1998 installation \"Oculus\" created by Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel. These eyes were modeled on photographs of the eyes of hundreds of New Yorkers.\n\nAccording to Jones and Ginzel,\n\n\nNYC Subway.org:\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\nGoogle Maps Street View:\n\n"}
{"id": "3491128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3491128", "title": "Contract A", "text": "Contract A\n\nIn Canadian contract law, Contract A is a concept that has recently been applied by courts regarding the fair and equal treatment of bidders in a contract tendering process. Essentially this concept formalizes previously applied precedents and strengthens the protection afforded to those who submit bids in the tendering process. The concept was introduced in 1981 by the Supreme Court of Canada, in \"R. v. Ron Engineering and Construction (Eastern) Ltd\". The court found that a \"duty of fairness\" was owed to all bidders by an owner in a tendering process.\n\nThe Contract A is formed when a \"request for proposal\" is responded to in the form of a valid bid, sometimes also known as submission of price. As many Contracts A are formed between the owner (person, company or organization tendering the project) and the bidders as their bids are received. The owner must now deal fairly and equally with all bidders, and must not show any favouritism or prejudice towards any bidder(s). In essence, this concept boils down to the right of an individual to have equal opportunity to be successful with their bid for work.\n\nA breach of Contract A may occur if the owner (or an owner's officer or representative, see vicarious liability), provides information, changes specification during the tendering process to unfairly benefit a particular bidder, enters into closed negotiations with an individual bidder in an effort to obtain more desirable contract conditions, etc. The most common situation in which an owner is accused of having breached Contract A occurs when a bidder is selected who is not the lowest bidder. This contravenes established custom and practice, which would normally dictate that the lowest bid be awarded the contract, but is not normally a source of a breach if handled properly. The successful suits for breach typically occur if the lowest bidder has been excluded based on a stipulation not clearly outlined in the tender documents (such as preference for local bidders) or when the Privilege Clause employed by the owner to exclude a principle of custom and practice is judged by the courts to be too broadly worded to have any meaning.\n\n"}

Drums were part of the field music for hundreds of years, being introduced by the Ottomans to Europe. Chinese armies however had used drums even before that. With the professionalization of armies, military music was developed as well. Drums were not only used for the men to march in step, but were an important part of the battlefield communications system, with various drum rolls used to signal different commands from officers to troops. By the second half of the 18th century, most, -if not all western armies had a standardized set of marches and signals to be played, often accompanied by fifers.\n\nThe romantic idea about drummers is that they were young boys (for instance the Christmas carol \"The Little Drummer Boy\", or the painting \"Steady the Drums\"). The fact, though, is that drummers were more often adult men, recruited like the common soldiers. Fifers, on the other hand, being not an official part of the regiments early on, were usually recruited from young boys. During the second half of the 19th century, it was accepted in many western armies that under aged boys served as drummers. \n\nAlthough there were usually official age limits, these were often ignored; the youngest boys were sometimes treated as mascots by the adult soldiers. The life of a drummer boy appeared rather glamorous and as a result, boys would sometimes run away from home to enlist. Other boys may have been the sons or orphans of soldiers serving in the same unit. The image of a small child in the midst of battle was seen as deeply poignant by 19th-century artists, and idealised boy drummers were frequently depicted in paintings, sculpture and poetry.\n\nNathan Futrell (1773–1829) was said to have been the youngest drummer boy in the American War of Independence; he joined the North Carolina Continental Militia at the age of 7.\n\nIn 1793, Joseph Bara, a 14-year-old French Republican drummer at the time of the War in the Vendée, was killed by royalist counter-revolutionaries, supposedly while he was shouting \"Long live the Republic!\". His body was interred at the Panthéon along with other national heroes.\n\nAndré Estienne was a drummer with Napoleon Bonaparte's army at the Battle of the Bridge of Arcole in 1796, where he led his battalion across a river while holding his drum over his head, and on reaching the far bank, beat the \"charge\". This led to the capture of the bridge and the rout of the Austrian army. Despite being 19 years old, he became famous as \"Le Petit Tambour d'Arcole\" (), and is depicted in the Panthéon in Paris and on the Arc de Triomphe, also in paintings by Charles Thévenin and Horace Vernet.\n\nOn 19 April 1855, at the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, there was a bayonet attack by the British 77th Regiment of Foot on some rifle pits which the Russians were using to snipe at British positions. Accompanying the attack was an unnamed drummer boy of the 77th, who seeing a Russian boy trumpeter trying to escape, caught hold of him and beat him with his fists \"in truly British fashion\" until he surrendered. The boy presented the Russian trumpet to Sir George Brown and he was later rewarded by General Lord Raglan, the British commander.\n\nAt the Siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, 12-year-old Drummer Ross of the 93rd Highlanders signalled the arrival of his regiment to the besieged garrison, by climbing the spire of the Shah Najaf Mosque and playing the regimental march on his bugle, while under heavy fire from the rebel forces.\n\nOn 28 November at the Second Battle of Cawnpore, 15-year-old Thomas Flynn, a drummer with the 64th Regiment of Foot, was awarded the Victoria Cross. \"During a charge on the enemy's guns, Drummer Flynn, although wounded himself, engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter with two of the rebel artillerymen\". He remains the youngest recipient of the medal.\nThirteen-year-old Charles King was the youngest soldier killed in the entire American Civil War (1861–1865). Charles enlisted in the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry with the reluctant permission of his father at the age of 12 years, 5 months and 9 days. On September 17, 1862 at the Battle of Antietam he was mortally wounded near or in the area of the East Woods, carried from the field and died three days later. Twelve-year-old drummer boy William Black was the youngest recorded person wounded in battle during the American Civil War. John Clem, who had unofficially joined a Union Army regiment at the age of 9 as a drummer and mascot, became famous as \"The Drummer Boy of Chickamauga\" where he played a \"long roll\" and shot a Confederate officer who had demanded his surrender. An 11-year-old drummer in the Confederate Orphan Brigade, known only as \"Little Oirish\", was credited with rallying troops at the Battle of Shiloh by taking up the regimental colors at a critical moment.\n\nIn Costa Rica, the Drummer boy Juan Santamaría died in an act of self-sacrifice in the war against the US Filibuster William Walker and is commemorated as his country's National Hero.\n\nThe use of drums beyond the parade ground declined rapidly as the 19th century progressed, being replaced by the bugle in the signalling role, although it was often the drummers who were required to play them. A widely reported incident at the Battle of Isandlwana during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, spelled the end of boys being sent on active service by the British Army. Part of the British force returned to their camp at night to find that it had been overrun by the Zulu army a few hours previously. An eyewitness reported that \"Even the little drummer boys that we had in the band, they were hung up on hooks, and opened like sheep. It was a pitiful sight\". Doubt has since been cast on this account, since the youngest drummer to be killed was 18, and the youngest boy present was 16. Despite this, Charles Edwin Fripp's famous painting, \"The Last Stand at Isandlwana\", shows a small blond-haired boy amongst the adult soldiers.\nThe US Army kept drummers and fifers with the infantry, until they were finally abolished in the field in 1917. Drums, like other instruments, were now only used for parades and ceremonies.\n\n"}

In technical terms, they are the increase of consumer surplus plus producer surplus from lower tariffs or otherwise liberalizing trade.\n\nGains from trade are commonly described as resulting from:\nMarket incentives, such as reflected in prices of outputs and inputs, are theorized to attract factors of production, including labor, into activities according to comparative advantage, that is, for which they each have a low opportunity cost. The factor owners then use their increased income from such specialization to buy more-valued goods of which they would otherwise be high-cost producers, hence their \"gains from trade\". The concept may be applied to an entire economy for the alternatives of autarky (no trade) or trade. A measure of total gains from trade is the sum of consumer surplus and producer profits or, more roughly, the increased output from specialization in production with resulting trade. Gains from trade may also refer to net benefits to a country from lowering barriers to trade such as tariffs on imports.\n\nDavid Ricardo in 1817 first clearly stated and proved the principle of comparative advantage, termed a \"fundamental analytical explanation\" for the source of gains from trade. But from publication of Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" in 1776, it was widely argued, that, with competition and absent market distortions, such gains are positive in moving toward free trade and away from autarky or prohibitively high import tariffs. Rigorous early contemporary statements of the conditions under which this proposition holds are found in Samuelson in 1939 and 1962. For the analytically tractable general case of Arrow-Debreu goods, formal proofs came in 1972 for determining the condition of no losers in moving from autarky toward free trade.\n\nIt does not follow that no tariffs are the best an economy could do. Rather, a large economy might be able to set taxes and subsidies to its benefit at the expense of other economies. Later results of Kemp and others showed that in an Arrow-Debreu world with a system of lump-sum compensatory mechanisms, corresponding to a customs union for a given subset set of countries (described by free trade among a group of economies and a common set of tariffs), there is a common set of \"world\"' tariffs such that no country would be worse off than in the smaller customs union. The suggestion is that if a customs union has advantages for an economy, there is a worldwide customs union that is at least as good for each country in the world.\n\nClassical economists maintain that there are two methods to measure the gains from trade: 1) international trade increases national income which helps us to get low priced imports; 2) gains are measured in terms of trade. To measure the gains from the trade, comparison of a country's cost of production with a foreign country's cost of production for the same product is required. However, it is very difficult to acquire the knowledge of cost of production and cost of imports in a domestic country. Therefore, terms of trade method is preferable to measure the gains from trade.\n\nThere are several factors which determine the gains from international trade:\n\n\nThe gains from trade can be clad into static and dynamic gains from trades. Static Gains means the increase in social welfare as a result of maximized national output due to optimum utilization of country's factor endowments or resources. Dynamic gains from trade, are those benefits which accelerate economic growth of the participating countries.\n\nStatic gains are the result of the operation of the theory of comparative cost in the field of foreign trade. On this principle countries make the optimum use of their available resources so that their national output is greater which also raises the level of social welfare in the country. When there is an introduction of foreign trade in the economy the result is called the static gains from trade.\n\nDynamic gains from trade relate to economic development of the economy. Specialization of the country for the production of best suited commodities which result in a large volume of quality production which promotes growth. Thus the extension of domestic market to foreign market will accelerate economic growth.\n\n\n\n"}

It was invented in 1940 by William J. Kroll in Luxembourg. After moving to the United States, Kroll further developed the method for the production of zirconium. The Kroll process replaced the Hunter process for almost all commercial production.\n\nPrior to the Kroll process, titanium is separated from its ores by the chloride process. For this process, the feedstock consists of refined rutile or ilmenite. This mixture reduced with petroleum-derived coke in a fluidized bed reactor at 1000 °C. The resulting mixture is then treated with chlorine gas, affording TiCl and other volatile chlorides, which are subsequently separated by continuous fractional distillation:\n\nIn the Kroll process, the TiCl is reduced by liquid magnesium at 800–850 °C in a stainless steel retort to ensure complete reduction:\n\nComplications result from partial reduction of the TiCl, giving to the lower chlorides TiCl and TiCl. The MgCl can be further refined back to magnesium. The resulting porous metallic titanium sponge is purified by leaching or heated vacuum distillation. The sponge is jackhammered out, crushed, and pressed before it is melted in a consumable carbon electrode vacuum arc furnace. The melted ingot is allowed to solidify under vacuum. It is often remelted to remove inclusions and ensure uniformity. These melting steps add to the cost of the product. Titanium is about six times as expensive as stainless steel.\n\nIn the Hunter process, which is not commercial, the TiCl from the chloride process is reduced to the metal by sodium.\n\nMany methods have been applied to the production of titanium metal, beginning with a report in 1887 by Nilsen and Pettersen using sodium, which was optimized into the commercial Hunter process. In the 1920s van Arkel had described the thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide to give highly pure titanium. Titanium tetrachloride was found to reduce with hydrogen at high temperatures to give hydrides that can be thermally processed to the pure metal. With this background, Kroll developed both new reductants and new apparatus for the reduction of titanium tetrachloride. Its high reactivity toward trace amounts of water and other metal oxides presented challenges. Significant success came with the use of calcium as a reductant, but the resulting still contained significant oxide impurities. Major success using magnesium at 1000 °C using a molybdenum clad reactor, as reported to the Electrochemical Society in Ottawa. Kroll's titanium was highly ductile reflecting its high purity. The Kroll process displaced the Hunter process and continues to be the dominant technology for the production of titanium metal, as well as driving the majority of the world's production of magnesium metal.\n\nOther technologies are competing with the Kroll process. One process involves electrolysis of a molten salt. Problems with this process include \"redox recycling,\" the failure of the diaphragm, and dendritic deposition in the electrolyte solution. Another process, the FFC Cambridge process, has been patented for a solid electrolytic solution, and its implementation would eliminate the titanium-sponge processing. Also in development is a pyrometallurgical route that involves the reduction of an intermediate form of titanium with aluminium. It combines the advantages of pyrometallurgy and a cheap reductant.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11217925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11217925", "title": "Paris Hilton", "text": "Paris Hilton\n\nParis Whitney Hilton (born February 17, 1981) is an American media personality, socialite, businesswoman, model, singer, DJ, author and actress. She is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, Hilton began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her lifestyle made her a feature of entertainment news and tabloid magazines, and Hilton was proclaimed \"New York's leading It girl\" in 2001. In 2003, a sex tape with Hilton and her then-boyfriend Rick Salomon, later released as \"1 Night in Paris\", was leaked to the public. Released only three weeks before the premiere of the reality television series \"The Simple Life\", in which she starred alongside her long-time friend Nicole Richie, the sex tape became a media sensation.\n\nIn 2004, Hilton released her book \"Confessions of an Heiress\", which became a \"New York Times\" Best Seller, in 2005, she appeared in the horror film \"House of Wax\", and in 2006, her self-titled album, \"Paris\", was released worldwide; it reached number six on the \"Billboard\" 200, with her debut single, \"Stars Are Blind\", quickly becoming a hit around the world. Hilton returned to reality television in 2008 with \"Paris Hilton's My New BFF\" and its two spin-offs: \"Paris Hilton's British Best Friend\" (2009) and \"Paris Hilton's Dubai BFF\" (2009), and again in 2011, with Oxygen series \"The World According to Paris\". Her big-screen credits include the films \"Raising Helen\" (2004), \"Bottoms Up\" (2006), \"National Lampoon's Pledge This!\" (2006), \"Repo! The Genetic Opera\" (2008), and Sofia Coppola's film \"The Bling Ring\" (2013) as well as the documentaries \"Paris, Not France\" (2008), \"Teenage Paparazzo\" (2010) and \"The American Meme\" (2018).\n\nIn 2012, Hilton made her debut as a DJ at the São Paulo Pop Music Festival. Initially panned by critics, she has become one of the highest-paid celebrity DJs, and between 2013 and 2017, held the \"Paris Hilton: Foam & Diamonds\" residence at the Amnesia nightclub in Ibiza. She signed a record deal with Cash Money Records in 2013, and has since released the singles \"Good Time\" (2013), \"Come Alive\" (2014), \"High Off My Love\" (2015), and \"I Need You\" (2018).\n\nCredited with influencing the revival of the famous for being famous phenomenon during the early and mid 2000s, Hilton exemplifies the \"celebutante\", a celebrity not through talent or work, but through inherited wealth and lifestyle. She has parlayed her media fame into perfumes and various lines with her endorsement; her perfume brand alone have brought in over US$2.5 billion in revenue, the second largest celebrity fragrance of all time behind Hollywood actress Elizabeth Taylor. In addition to a Paris Hilton Beach Club Resort in Manila, the Philippines, there are currently 50 Paris Hilton stores worldwide and 19 product lines, such as handbags, watches, footwear, hair and skin care. Hilton earns over US$10 million a year from business ventures and, as of 2015, was paid about US$300,000 for appearances in clubs and events.\n\nHilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (née Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino), is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard \"Rick\" Hilton, is a businessman. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia \"Nicky\" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Her maternal aunts are television personalities Kim and Kyle Richards. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. She was raised in the Catholic faith.\n\nShe moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. Her sister Nicky once described her as \"very much a tomboy\" who dreamed about becoming a veterinarian. As a child, she was friends with actress Bijou Phillips and socialites Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian. Her mother was a close friend of Michael Jackson, with Hilton remarking in an interview: \"I grew up around Michael, and anytime he’d have a music video or a concert, he would always invite my family\".\n\nGrowing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995. Her freshman year of high school (1995–96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast. At age 15, she attended Professional Children's School, and at 16, spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens. She then attended the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. \"She knew no one at [Dwight]\", said her mother in an interview, while a classmate described her as \"sort of more sophisticated. She was different from everybody else\". She later earned a GED certification.\n\nAfter originally modeling as a child at charity events, Hilton signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management, at age 19. She became a notable fixture in parties and social events, and her late-night persona was well-documented in local tabloids. A \"New York Post\" article, describing Hilton, wrote: \"The most outrageous [New York City-based heiress] is hotel-darling Paris Hilton, 19, a part-time model with a tendency to flash her thong\". Similarly, producer Cisco Adler called Hilton \"a young party girl who gets sucked into the L.A. party scene and grew up a little too fast\" in a \"Vanity Fair\" profile. She played an ill-fated character in the independent teen thriller \"Sweetie Pie\" (2000).\n\nBy 2001, Hilton had developed a reputation as a socialite, and was hailed as \"New York's leading It Girl\", whose fame was beginning to \"extend beyond the New York tabloids\". She made a cameo appearance as herself in the comedy \"Zoolander\", with Ben Stiller, and posed for David LaChapelle in \"Vanity Fair\", alongside her sister Nicky, wearing a silver jacket with no top or bra, in September 2001. She also graced several other magazine covers, including the UK's \"Tatler\", Italy's \"Giola\" and the US' \"FHM\".\n\nAmid her growing public profile, businessman George J. Maloof Jr. paid Hilton to wear a dress made from US$1 million in poker chips and attend the Palms Casino Resort opening in Las Vegas in November 2001, which was the first of numerous offers for Hilton to show up in nightclubs for promotion, and marked the beginning of what soon became, for celebrities, making a business out of partying. In 2002, Hilton appeared in Vincent Gallo's \"Honey Bunny\" video, and played the lead role in the straight-to-DVD horror film \"Nine Lives\". \"Beyondhollywood.com\", describing her role, asserted: \"Hilton plays—what else?—a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day\". During the early 2000s, Hilton was a frequent model for Lloyd Klein's fashion shows.\n\nHilton's breakout came in 2003, when she starred with her socialite counterpart Nicole Richie in the Fox reality series \"The Simple Life\", in which they lived for a month with a family in the rural community of Altus, Arkansas. The series premiered on December 2, 2003, shortly after the release of Hilton's sex tape, and was a ratings success; its first episode attracted 13 million viewers, increasing Fox's adult 18–49 rating by 79 percent. The high viewership was attributed to the exposure Hilton received for the tape. She became known for her onscreen dumb blonde persona—a character she eventually distanced herself from, stating she was playing a role.\n\nThe socialite introduced a lifestyle brand in 2004, helping to design a purse collection for the Japanese label Samantha Thavasa. A jewelry line designed by Hilton was sold on Amazon.com shortly after. In the fall of 2004, she released an autobiography co-written by Merle Ginsberg, \"\", with color photos and advice on life as an heiress. The book was seventh on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. Her quote, \"Dress cute wherever you go; life is too short to blend in\", was added to The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations in September 2009. Hilton was involved in creating a perfume line by Parlux Fragrances. Originally planned for a small release, high demand led to increased availability by December 2004. Its introduction was followed by a 47-percent increase in Parlux sales, primarily of the Hilton-branded perfume. After this success Parlux released several more perfumes with her name, including fragrances for men.\nIn February 2005, Hilton hosted NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\", with Keane as the musical guest, and in May, the slasher film \"House of Wax\"—her first major film role— was released in theaters, to mixed reviews. Writing for \"View London\", Matthew Turner remarked that Hilton \"does better than you might expect\", while \"TV Guide\" called Hilton \"talentless\". Her role earned her the Teen Choice Award for Best Scream and the 2005 Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. She also received a nomination for Best Frightened Performance at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards. \"House of Wax\" grossed over US$70 million worldwide. Hilton appeared in a television commercial entitled \"Paris Car Wash,\" promoting Carl's Jr.'s Spicy Burger product, which started airing in May 2005. By the fall of 2005, she had published her second book, \"\", and introduced another fragrance, \"Just Me\".\n\n\"The Simple Life\" was canceled by Fox after three seasons in 2005 following a dispute between Hilton and Richie. Neither Richie nor Hilton spoke publicly about their split, although it was speculated that they fell out after Richie showed one of Hilton's homemade sex tapes to a group of their friends. They reconciled in October 2006. After \"The Simple Life\" was cancelled, other networks (NBC, The WB, VH1 and MTV) were reportedly interested in obtaining the rights for new seasons of the show. On November 28, 2005, E! announced that it had picked up \"The Simple Life\", ordering the production of a fourth season and obtaining the rights to repeat the first three seasons. Shooting for the new season began on February 27, 2006. The fourth-season premiere of the show was a ratings success for its new network.\n\nHilton released her self-titled debut album, \"Paris\", on August 22, 2006. The album reached number six on the \"Billboard\" 200, and sold over 600,000 copies worldwide. Its first single, \"Stars Are Blind\", was played on more than 125 pop stations in the U.S. The song was a worldwide hit, reaching the top ten in 17 countries. Critical reception was generally mixed, but \"AllMusic\" called the album \"more fun than anything released by Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson\".\n\nHer film \"Bottoms Up\" was released straight-to-DVD in late 2006. Australia's \"Urban Cinefile\", describing Hilton, wrote that she \"spends most of her screen time flicking her hair as she delivers lines like 'books are those things you read.'\" \"National Lampoon's Pledge This!\", another film in which Hilton starred, was also released in DVD in 2006; she missed its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, protesting the addition of several nude scenes: \"I was so angry I snubbed my own premiere.\" In August 2008 Worldwide Entertainment Group sued Hilton in Miami District Court, alleging that she did not fulfill her contractual agreement to provide \"reasonable promotion and publicity\" for the film. She reportedly received US$1 million for her role. Also in 2006, Hilton licensed her name to Gameloft for their mobile video game \"Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest\".\nOn January 10, 2007, Hilton introduced her DreamCatchers line of hair extensions in partnership with Hair Tech International. Due to her incarceration, \"The Simple Life\" finished its run at the end of its fifth season in July 2007. In early August, Hilton signed a licensing agreement with Antebi for a signature footwear line (Paris Hilton Footwear, featuring stilettos, platforms, flats, wedges and a sports collection) which reached stores in 2008. In mid-August, she introduced a line of tops, dresses, coats and jeans at the Kitson Boutique in Los Angeles. In December 2007, she posed nude (covered with gold paint) to promote \"Rich Prosecco\", a canned version of the Italian sparkling wine, traveling to Germany to appear in print ads for the wine. In 2007, Hilton also modeled for 2 B Free and introduced her fourth perfume, Can Can.\n\nIn February 2008, \"The Hottie and the Nottie\", a romantic comedy in which Hilton starred, was released theatrically; the film was a critical and commercial failure, with Hilton eventually receiving the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. Hilton's love for dogs led her to create a canine apparel line, Little Lily by Paris Hilton, with some of the proceeds benefiting animal rescue, in early 2008. In April 2008, she appeared in the \"My Name Is Earl\" episode \"I Won't Die with a Little Help from My Friends\".\n\nOn August 6, 2008 Hilton appeared in an online video, \"Paris Hilton Responds to McCain Ad\", directed by Adam McKay and posted on the Funny or Die website. The video, featuring Hilton in a parody advertisement, was made in response to a television campaign ad (\"Celeb\") by the 2008 John McCain presidential campaign. In \"Celeb\" McCain compared Barack Obama to celebrities such as Hilton and Britney Spears, questioning his readiness to lead and criticizing his energy policy. In what \"The Washington Post\" said \"might just be her best acting role yet\", Hilton wore a leopard-print swimsuit in the video. It had seven million views in two days, receiving worldwide press coverage and written and verbal responses from both campaigns.\n\nAt the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival a documentary about Hilton, \"Paris, Not France\", was screened. She starred in a MTV reality series, \"Paris Hilton's My New BFF\", about her search for a new best friend, which premiered shortly after, on September 30, 2008. The series was a hit and topped all other cable shows in its time slot. In October, she appeared in a second parody video on \"Funny or Die\", \"Paris Hilton Gets Presidential with Martin Sheen\", with Martin Sheen; Sheen's son, actor Charlie Sheen, made a cameo appearance. Hilton, in a green evening dress and wearing heavy makeup, discusses political issues with Martin Sheen in his \"West Wing\" role.\n\nIn her next film, the Gothic rock musical \"Repo! The Genetic Opera\", she played Amber Sweet, the surgery and painkiller-addicted daughter of a biotech magnate. After screening at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International, the film received a limited release. \"Horror.com\" said: \"Not only is this by far Hilton's best role, she's actually got a grain of gravitas in the end\". However, \"Jam! Movies\" called her a \"hopeless twit as an actress\". She was nominated for the 2009 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for the role. Around that time, Hilton released her fifth fragrance for women, Fairy Dust.\nAs a result of the American version's success, on January 29, 2009 \"Paris Hilton's British Best Friend\" debuted on ITV2 in England. The second season of \"Paris Hilton's My New BFF\" premiered on June 2, 2009. Hilton shot at the time \"Paris Hilton's Dubai BFF\", which was finally broadcast in 2011. In May 2009, Hilton won the Female Celebrity Fragrance of the Year Award at the 2009 Fifi Awards, in July, her sixth fragrance for women, Siren, was introduced, and in August, she appeared in the fifth episode of \"Supernatural\"s fifth season. She was involved in the creation of a sunglass line by Gripping Eyewear, which she introduced in October. In November, Hilton introduced a hair-and-beauty-products line which included shampoos, conditioners and hair vitamins.\n\nIn February 2010, Hilton participated in an advertising campaign for the Brazilian beer Devassa Bem Loura, whose slogan roughly translates into English as \"very blonde bitch\". As part of the campaign, she rode the brewery's float in the Rio Carnival. On August 10, Hilton released her 10th fragrance, Tease, which was inspired by Marilyn Monroe. On August 19, she launched a footwear line in Las Vegas. The critically acclaimed documentary \"Teenage Paparazzo\", in which Hilton appeared, aired on HBO on September 27.\n\nShe had her first voice-over role in the ABC made-for-television film \"The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation\". The film aired on November 28, 2010 and received good ratings, with 2.611 million viewers. In December 2010, Hilton launched her motorcycle team; her Spanish driver, Maverick Viñales, won the final race and finished third overall in the 125cc world championship the following November. She modeled for a second time at the 2011 Brazil Fashion Week (her first time was in early 2010). In February, Hilton introduced a fragrance line, the Passport Collection, with perfumes inspired by cities such as Paris, South Beach, Florida and Tokyo. The following month, she introduced a footwear collection in Mexico. Around that time, she introduced a mobile application which became available for iPhone and iPod touch.\n\nOn May 12, 2011, Hilton opened her third store in the Philippines, at the Abreeza Mall in Davao City. On June 1, she returned to reality television in Oxygen's \"The World According to Paris\". The show, which followed her daily life, was not a success, which led to a belief that Hilton's popularity was fading. \"The New York Times\" wrote that she \"is an attractive woman with proven talent for marketing and self-promotion, though as a reality heroine she seems a little passé [...] it's hard to see how she can recapture the kind of audience she enjoyed in her heyday—even by streaming her premiere live on Facebook\". Nevertheless, she was labeled a \"Billion Dollar Entrepreneur\" by \"Variety\" magazine, and was featured on its cover. Hilton opened her fourth store in the Philippines on August 18, 2011. In September, she introduced a footwear line in Istanbul, and a Paris Hilton store opened in India. Hilton modeled for designer Andre Tan during Ukraine Fashion Week in October 2011.\n\nIn February 2012, Hilton introduced a new line of sunglasses in Shanghai, which she called a \"huge success\", and in May, she released her fifteenth perfume, Dazzle. In June, Hilton made her debut as a DJ at a Brazilian pop-music festival, attracting a great deal of controversy and negative responses from DJs Deadmau5, Samantha Ronson and Afrojack. Shortly after her performance, she became a trending topic on Twitter.\n\nIn August 2012, her footwear line was nominated for the Best Celebrity Licensee of the Year award at the International Licensing Excellence Awards, and the socialite appeared in a music video for Korean singer Kim Jang-hoon, which was filmed on Malibu Beach. She was reportedly paid US$1 million for her appearance in the video, which premiered in 3D in October 2012. In November, Hilton opened a store in Mecca; since it is considered the \"holiest city in the Muslim world\" and Saudi Arabia is a conservative country, controversy about her personal life swirled on Twitter. In early December, she modeled for designers Shane and Falguni Peacock at India Fashion Week, also appearing as a DJ.\n\nIn January 2013, Hilton appeared in four episodes of the Danish version of \"Paradise Hotel\", for which she was reportedly paid $300,000, and also appeared in two episodes of \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\", in which her aunts Kyle and Kim Richards star. In April, Hilton opened the 44th Paris Hilton store in Bogotá, Colombia. In May, Hilton signed with Cash Money Records and appeared in the music video for Rich Gang's song \"Tapout\", alongside Lil Wayne, Christina Milian and Nicki Minaj.\n\nHilton made a cameo appearance in Sofia Coppola's film \"The Bling Ring\" (2013), about the infamous group of teenagers who had robbed homes of celebrities such as Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Orlando Bloom. In addition to appearing in the film, she loaned Coppola her house for two weeks of shooting. Recalling the house, Coppola said: \"It was like we have to get this into the movie. It was so unique. It would be hard to recreate that. She is larger than life and her house is like Paris World.\"\nDuring August 2013, Hilton was a DJ at Amnesia's weekly \"Foam and Diamonds\" parties on Ibiza. The positive reaction from critics and audiences led to her contract's renewal for the subsequent four years. In October, Hilton released the first single through Cash Money, \"Good Time\", featuring rapper Lil Wayne. It debuted at number eighteen on the US \"Billboard\" Dance/Electronic Songs chart. In November, Hilton won the Best Breakthrough DJ award at the NRJ DJ Awards.\n\nIn March 2014, Hilton unveiled her first real estate project, the Paris Beach Club, in collaboration with Century Properties Group, Inc., at the Azure Urban Resort Residences in Parañaque, the Philippines. In July 2014, her next single, \"Come Alive\", was released, and she made a cameo appearance in another Carl's Jr. commercial, paying homage to the one in which she starred in 2005. By the end of 2014, she established herself as one of the highest-paid DJs, earning up to US$1 million for set; she also won as Best Female DJ at the NJR DJ Awards.\n\nIn March 2015, Hilton released her 19th fragrance, a limited edition of her second fragrance, Heiress, and Animoca Brands, a mobile game developer from Hong Kong, announced that they had secured a license from Hilton to use her name and likeness to produce mobile games and themes. In May, her third single under Cash Money, \"High Off My Love\", was released. It eventually peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" US Dance Club Songs chart. In 2016, Hilton teamed up with Lidl for a hair care collection, and released her 20th fragrance, Gold Rush; she subsequently released Rosé Rush, in 2017, and Platinum Rush, in 2018.\n\nIn February 2017, Hilton walked the runway at Christian Cowan’s fall show in New York City. She appeared in the video for the Demi Lovato song \"Sorry Not Sorry\", which premiered in July 2017. In September 2017, she modeled at the Philipp Plein show during Milan Fashion Week. A video for \"I Don't Want It at All\", the debut single of Kim Petras, was released in October featuring Hilton in a cameo.\nIn January 2018, Hilton modeled Kanye West's Yeezy Season 6 collection by recreating paparazzi photos of Kim Kardashian. She released \"I Need You\" as a digital download on February 14, 2018 (Valentine's Day). It debuted at number 48 and peaked at number 32 on the Dance Club Songs \"Billboard\" chart. She subsequently appeared in two social media themed-projects; the documentary \"The American Meme\" premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival, and the series \"Hollywood Love Story\" aired on Viceland, starting in July 2018.\n\nHilton and Boohoo.com collaborated on a 70-piece collection, which launched on June 20, 2018. After releasing the \"Unicorn Mist\" rose water in late 2017, she launched a skincare line on June 29, 2018. Hilton modeled The Blonds show and opened the show for Namalia during New York Fashion Week in September 2018.\n\nA fixture in entertainment news for her late-night persona by 2001, Hilton attracted widespread notoriety for her participation in \"1 Night in Paris\" (a sex tape leaked before the first episode of \"The Simple Life\") in late 2003. Paparazzi mobs started to follow her, and her relationships and lifestyle in general became targets of gossip sites and tabloid media worldwide. Critics suggest that Hilton epitomizes being famous for being famous, exemplifying the \"celebutante\" phenomenon—a celebrity for no particularly identifiable reason other than inherited wealth and lavish lifestyle. She has been credited with influencing the revival of the term during the early-to-mid 2000s, and once remarked: \"Back in the day, when I first came into this world, there was no one like it. It was almost like creating a new genre, and I think before its time. [...] Now we see it all coming back, and everyone’s calling me the OG, and it’s like, yeah. It feels really good\".\n\nIn 2004, Hilton was named one of the \"10 Most Fascinating People\", according to Barbara Walters' annual primetime\nspecial (\"Paris' Most Shocking Moments\"). She ranked 59th, 23rd, 34th and 35th in \"FHM\"s 100 Sexiest Women poll in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2012, respectively, and was 20th and 38th on \"Maxim\" magazine's Hot 100 list in 2005 and 2006. In a poll conducted by the Associated Press and AOL Hilton was the second-Worst Celebrity Role Model of 2006, behind Britney Spears. Lloyd Grove banned her from his \"New York Daily News\" gossip column, and in February 2007 the Associated Press attempted to not mention her for a week. In May Hilton denied calling herself the \"iconic blonde of the decade\", like Princess Diana and Marilyn Monroe, in \"Harper's Bazaar\". She appeared in the 2007 \"Guinness World Records\" as the world's Most Overrated Celebrity.\n\nIn 2009, a quiet relationship between Hilton and the tabloids led entertainment writers to suggest that her popularity had waned; she was the subject of a CNN story, asking, \"Why has Paris Hilton disappeared?\". This suspicion was reinforced in June 2011 when her reality show, \"The World According to Paris\", had low ratings and Hilton walked out during an interview with \"Good Morning America\" when asked if she worried about her moment having passed. However, following her involvement with the filming of \"The Bling Ring\" and her deal with Cash Money Records in 2013, she became a trending topic worldwide on Twitter and media outlets noted 2013 as Hilton's \"pop culture renaissance\" year.\n\nIn 2011, Hilton was named one of the 100 Hottest Women of All Time by \"Men's Health\", but according to an Ipsos poll she was the most unpopular celebrity with Americans (with 60 percent of respondents viewing her unfavorably). In 2012, she ranked fifth on \"Forbes\" Most Over-Exposed list.\n\nThe catchphrase \"That's hot\" is Hilton's signature line. The catchphrase is also registered as a trademark for products, like clothing apparel, electronic devices, and alcoholic beverages.\n\nOn September 6, 2007, Hilton filed an injunction lawsuit against Hallmark Cards Inc., titled \"Hilton v. Hallmark Cards\", in U.S. District Court over the unlawful use of her picture and catchphrase \"That's hot\" on a greeting card. The card is titled \"Paris's First Day as a Waitress\" with a photograph of Hilton's face on a cartoon of a waitress serving a plate of food, with a dialogue bubble saying \"Don't touch that, it's hot\" (which had a registered trademark on February 13, 2007). Hilton's attorney Brent Blakely said that the infringement damages would be based on profits from the greeting cards. Julie O'Dell said that Hallmark used the card as parody, protected under fair use law. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reviewed the case and \"denied Hallmark's motion to dismiss\". Hilton and Hallmark Cards Inc. later settled out of court.\n\nHilton has had two popular television characters loosely based on her real-life persona: London Tipton from \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" (Tipton's father in the series is a hotel mogul) and Caroline Channing in \"2 Broke Girls\".\n\nThe \"World of Warcraft\" massively multiplayer online role-playing game has featured a character named Haris Pilton, labeled a \"socialite\", since the release of \"\" expansion on January 15, 2007. The character remains in the game as of April 2015.\n\nHilton has been parodied in the \"South Park\" episode \"Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset\" (2004), and in the Hollywood films \"White Chicks\" (2004), \"Date Movie\" (2006), \"Epic Movie\" (2007), and \"Meet the Spartans\" (2008). In 2007, she was the subject of the Youtube spoof video \"Paris in Jail\", inspired by her single \"Stars Are Blind\", which had been played more than 7 million times by the first month of its publishing. Amber Hay, the actress who portrayed Hilton in the aforementioned video, also portrayed her in the made-for-television film \"Paparazzi Princess: The Paris Hilton Story\" (2008).\n\nHilton lives in Mulholland Estates, a gated community in Los Angeles, California. She also has a penthouse in Lower Manhattan, NYC.\n\nHilton is known for her love of small dogs, and has had a female Chihuahua named Tinkerbell among many other pets. Hilton was frequently seen carrying Tinkerbell (dubbed an \"accessory dog\") at social events and functions, and in all five seasons of television reality show \"The Simple Life\". In September 2014, she bought a Pomeranian dog, worth US$13,000, and in January 2015, she spent US$25,000 in two other, for herself and for her mother as a 35th anniversary gift. In April 2015, it was reported that Tinkerbell had died at the age of 14. For her pets, a 300-square-foot home with air conditioning, heating and designer furniture was built at an estimated cost of US$325,000.\nOn January 22, 2007, her private life became public on ParisExposed.com, a website with images of personal documents, video and other material allegedly obtained when the contents of a storage locker rented by Hilton were auctioned in lieu of a US$208 payment. The website, which charged for online access to the material, had 1.2 million visitors in just over 40 hours. Among its contents were medications, diaries, photographs, contracts, love letters and a video shot by Joe Francis of Girls Gone Wild. Hilton obtained a temporary injunction against ParisExposed.com which shut down the website.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2009, Hilton's home was burgled several times by the Bling Ring, a group of fashion-motivated thieves. It was not until nearly US$2 million were stolen in jewelry, clothing, cash, and other items from Hilton that she reported having been burgled. Later, Hilton agreed to having the movie \"The Bling Ring\" shot in her house where the burglaries took place.\n\nOn September 20, 2012, an audio recording of Hilton making derogatory comments about gay people was posted on the Internet. That day, following a backlash, she issued an apology through GLAAD in which she said she was a \"huge supporter of the gay community\" and called gay people \"the strongest and most inspiring people I know\". As a result of her remarks, Logo TV canceled plans to air a documentary about her (\"Paris Hilton Inc\").\n\nHilton has a pink Bentley Continental, another Bentley convertible, a Rolls-Royce Ghost, a Ferrari, a Lexus coupe, and a Yukon Hybrid.\n\nThroughout her life, Hilton's personal life, and especially her extensive list of relationships and romantic associations with other high-profile figures, has drawn a large amount of media attention and public disapproval. In 2000, for instance, the then-19-year-old rose tabloids' attention when she and Leonardo DiCaprio were seen together on the NYC late-night circuit. That led to Hilton adamantly deny to \"Vanity Fair\", in one of her first magazine profiles, that they were involved. She dated actor Edward Furlong in 2000, and poker player Rick Salomon, with whom she filmed her sex tape, circa early 2000s. She was engaged to fashion model Jason Shaw from 2002 to 2003. They have reportedly remained friends since their split. She had a seven-month relationship with singer Nick Carter in 2004; Carter opened up about their relationship in his 2013 autobiography. \"Paris was the worst person in the world for me to hook up with,\" he wrote. \"[She] fed my worst impulses as far as partying.\" \n\nHilton started dating Greek shipping heir Paris Latsis in December 2004, and both became engaged seven months later. In November 2005, however, they called the impending nuptials off. She next had a relationship with another Greek heir, Stavros Nicharos, who she dated on and off until March 2007. Hilton dated Good Charlotte guitarist Benji Madden for nine months, until November 2008. An on and off relationship with \"The Hills\" star Doug Reinhardt followed, but they broke up definitely in April 2010, when she became concerned that he was using her to further his career. She would next date Las Vegas nightclub owner Cy Waits until June 2011. After her split with Waits, Hilton was rumoured to have a relationship with Dutch DJ Afrojack, but he distanced himself amid her growing DJ career. She had a relationship with Spanish model River Viiperi between 2012 and 2014, and dated businessman Thomas Gross between 2015 and April 2016.\n\nActor Chris Zylka proposed to her with a ring worth US$2 million in January 2018, during a vacation in Aspen, after one year of dating. They called off their engagement in November 2018.\n\nIn 2003, a sex tape featuring Hilton and then-boyfriend Rick Salomon was leaked onto the Internet. Shortly afterward, Salomon filed a lawsuit against the company that distributed the tape, and against the Hilton family, whom he accused of tarnishing his reputation by suggesting that he had exploited Hilton. Hilton later sued the company that released the tape, Kahatani Ltd., for $30 million for violation of privacy and emotional distress.\n\nIn April 2004, Salomon began distributing the tape himself through the adult film company Red Light District Video under the title \"1 Night in Paris\". In July 2004, Salomon dropped his lawsuit against the Hilton family after Paris Hilton's privacy lawsuit was thrown out of court. Salomon and Red Light District Video agreed to pay Hilton US$400,000 plus a percentage of the tape's sale profit.\n\nIn August 2010, a man identified as Nathan Lee Parada, was arrested after security men spotted him wielding two knives outside Hilton's house. He was later found guilty of one felony count of attempted first-degree residential burglary, and was sentenced to two years in state prison.\n\nIn October 2010, a man named James Rainford allegedly bicycled past guards at the entrance to her gated community, went to her house and began pounding on her door. He was arrested, and earned three years' probation, along with a restraining order from Hilton. In April 2011, Rainford was arrested a second time for attacking her then-boyfriend Cy Waits outside Van Nuys Superior Court, where Hilton was headed to testify against Nathan Lee Parada, and in July, he was arrested again outside her Malibu beach house. He was subsequently charged with two felony stalking counts and three misdemeanor counts of disobeying a court order, but a judge found him to be \"mentally incompetent to stand trial\" and was sent to a state mental hospital.\n\nIn October 2014, a German man identified as Lukas Redanz, who was completely covered with tattoos of Hilton and appeared to be \"extremely drunk\", repeatedly went to her gated community to see her. Guards called the police and the man was arrested for possession of cocaine.\n\nIn September 2006, Hilton was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, with a blood alcohol content of 0.08%. Hilton's driver's license was suspended in November 2006, and in January 2007 she pleaded no contest to a reckless driving charge. Her sentence was 36 months' probation and fines totaling about US$1,500. In January 2007, she was stopped for driving with a suspended license, and signed an agreement that she was not permitted to drive. The next month, she was caught driving 70 mph in a 35-mph zone without headlights at night with a suspended license. Prosecutors in the office of the Los Angeles City Attorney charged that these infractions and her failure to enroll in a court-ordered alcohol-education program violated her probation. On May 4, Hilton was sentenced by Judge Michael T. Sauer to 45 days in jail for the probation violation. She planned to appeal the sentence, supporting an online petition (created on May 5 by Joshua Morales) asking California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for a pardon. A counter-petition to maintain the sentence was posted. Hilton changed lawyers and dropped her plans to appeal.\nShe was required to begin her jail term on June 5, and entered the Century Regional Detention Facility (a women's prison in Lynwood, California) after attending the 2007 MTV Movie Awards on June 3. On June 7, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca signed an order resentencing Hilton to 40 days of home confinement with an electronic monitoring device due to an unspecified medical condition. Baca said, \"My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities more than the average American is not justice.\" He added, \"The special treatment, in a sense, appears to be because of her celebrity status ... She got more time in jail.\" Judge Michael Sauer summoned her to reappear in court the following morning (June 8), since her original sentence specified imprisonment: \"No work furlough. No work release. No electronic monitoring.\" At the hearing, Sauer declined a briefing in chambers by Hilton's attorney on her medical condition and sent her back to jail to serve the original 45-day sentence. When she heard the decision, Hilton shouted \"It's not right!\" Screaming, she asked to hug her mother. Hilton was moved to the medical wing of the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles, and returned to the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood on June 13. Paris Hilton was released from jail on Tuesday, June 26, 2007.\n\nThe socialite was influenced by minister Marty Angelo in jail, referring to a \"new beginning\" in an interview with talk-show host Larry King on June 28, 2007 (two days after her release) and quoting from Angelo's autobiography (\"Once Life Matters: A New Beginning\"). On June 9, Angelo unsuccessfully petitioned Sauer to let him serve the remainder of Hilton's sentence if the judge would release her to an alternative treatment program. Hilton told King during the interview that she had taken Adderall for ADHD since childhood.\n\nOn July 2, 2010, Hilton was accused of smoking marijuana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup game between Brazil and the Netherlands. Although she was escorted from the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium by local police, the case was later dismissed. Her publicist, Dawn Miller, said: \"I can confirm that the incident was a complete misunderstanding and it was actually another person in the group who did it\". Two weeks later, Hilton was detained and released after she was caught with cannabis at Corsica's Figari Sud-Corse Airport.\n\nIn August 2010, Hilton was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession in Las Vegas and her boyfriend, Cy Waits, was charged with driving under the influence. Hilton's defense initially claimed that the handbag (containing 0.8g of cocaine) was not hers: \"This purse in question was a high street brand – and by no means up to her high fashion standards.\" She later claimed personal items (including cash and credit cards) from the bag, acknowledging that it was hers. To avoid a felony conviction, Hilton pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors on September 17, 2010. Under the terms of the plea bargain she was sentenced to one year of probation, 200 hours of community service, a US$2,000 fine and the completion of a drug-abuse treatment program. Clark County District Attorney David Roger said, \"If she was arrested for anything besides a minor traffic violation she will spend a year in jail. There will be no discussion. The court will have no discretion.\"\n\nOn September 21, 2010, on their way to a Tokyo press conference to promote fashion and fragrance lines, Hilton and her sister Nicky were stopped by immigration officers at Narita Airport because of Hilton's drug-possession conviction the previous day. Under Japan's strict drug laws, travelers convicted of a drug crime are usually denied entry into the country. Airport officials questioned Hilton \"for hours\", and she and Nicky were detained overnight at the airport hotel. On September 22 Japanese authorities denied Hilton entry, and she was put on a plane back to the United States. Other stops on their Asian promotional tour were canceled due to Indonesia and Malaysia's anti-drug laws.\n\nAs a socialite, Hilton has been a frequent guest at fundraising events around the globe, and regularly visits children's hospitals and orphanages when she is abroad. She has been involved with the Starlight Children's Foundation and the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and is listed on the \"First Families\" of the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, which means she has donated US$100,000 or more to the hospital. In 2008, a room at the hospital was named in her honor, and for her charitable efforts, Starlight awarded Hilton, along with mother Kathy and sister Nicky, the 2011 Heart of Gold Award.\n\nIn 2011, Hilton participated in the NOH8 Campaign. \n\nIn August 2015, Hilton raised US$100,000 for children with disabilities in Ibiza.\n\nIn February 2017, Hilton donated 50 of her personal items to the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and the Starlight Children's Foundation. In November 2017, she visited San Gregorio Atlapulco, Mexico, where she handed out food and clothes to the damnified families following the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake; she also made a donation of US$350,000 to help rebuild seven different homes that were affected.\n\nIn October 2018, Hilton hosted Rock The Runway, an event benefitting Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and The Sasha Project LA.\n\nHilton reportedly earned about US$2 million between 2003 and 2004, US$6.5 million between 2004 and 2005, and US$7 million between 2005 and 2006.\n\nIn December 2007, Hilton's grandfather Barron Hilton pledged 97 percent of his estate (the Hilton family fortune) to a charitable organization founded by her great-grandfather Conrad N. Hilton: the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. As a result, his grandchildren's inheritance was reduced. An immediate pledge of US$1.2 billion (proceeds from the sale of Hilton Hotels Corporation) was made, with a further US$1.1 billion due after his death. Barron cited the actions of his father, Conrad N. Hilton, as the motivation for his pledge. Conrad (Barron's father) had also left 97 percent of his estate to the foundation, and Barron contested his father's will to regain a sizable amount of the family fortune in a settlement.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Brinkley is the co-founder and current CEO of North America Western Asia Holdings, an investment and business development firm based in Washington, D.C. Brinkley served as the United States Deputy Undersecretary of Defense under Secretaries of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates from 2004 to 2011.\n\nBrinkley attended Texas A&M University, graduating with Bachelor's and Master's degrees in industrial engineering. He later completed part-time doctoral work in operations research at North Carolina State University, before choosing to focus on his professional career. Brinkley has published research on mathematical modeling, industrial statistics, and artificial intelligence.\n\nBrinkley began his career as an engineer with Northern Telecom Ltd., later Nortel Networks. Brinkley and his colleagues received four US patents for his work at Nortel. Brinkley later joined JDS Uniphase Corporation, where he held multiple roles, including Senior Vice President for Supply Chain Management, Senior Vice President for Customer Service and Inside Sales and Chief Information Officer. While at JDS Uniphase, Brinkley served as a member of the international economic development advisory board to the Government of Fujian Province in the People's Republic of China.\n\nBrinkley accepted an appointment as Deputy Undersecretary of Defense in 2004.\n\nIn partnership with Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Financial Management Thomas Modly, Brinkley consolidated Department-wide business systems used by the Department of the Army, Department of the Navy and Department of the Air Force into the Business Transformation Agency. The work of the Business Transformation Agency was lauded by the Government Accountability Office for streamlining departmental business systems.\n\nIn 2006, under the direction of Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England, Brinkley established the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations, charged with restoring normal economic activity in Iraq during widespread conflict in the Iraq War, and to streamline and transform the Department's contracting process and systems in Iraq. While interdepartmental disagreements took place given the nature of the TFBSO's directives, the task force focused on making business development a component of a broader military counter-insurgency. At its peak in Iraq, TFBSO had over 350 professionals deployed in every province of the country, including large numbers of civilian business leaders and agriculture experts from the American private sector and academia. Over 200 international companies visited Iraq as part of the foreign direct investment initiative sponsored by TFBSO, with 80 initiating business activity as a result of their engagement. The Task Force directly facilitated over $8 billion in foreign direct investment.\n\nIn 2009, the TFBSO began work supporting the United States mission in Afghanistan, placing heavy focus on rapid development of mining resources with a goal of imposing environmental and socially responsible processes for the Afghan government to finance its own security and development. TFBSO also launched aggressive efforts to encourage foreign investment in other sectors, including agriculture and information technology.\n\nIn addition to its work in Afghanistan and Iraq, TFBSO projects supported the US Embassy in Islamabad and the United States Africa Command in Rwanda and Sudan.\n\nBrinkley received the Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest civilian award conferred by the Department of Defense, for his service in establishing and leading the TFBSO. He also received the Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the highest civilian award conferred by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for his contributions to the stabilization of Iraq. In 2006, he received the Eagle Award, an annual award for the outstanding civilian information technology leader in the federal government, for his work leading defense business modernization. \nIn 2010, Brinkley and four members of his team were meeting with a hotel manager when a powerful car bomb detonated 30 meters from their conference room in downtown Baghdad. The blast destroyed the building's exterior façade and shattered windows, causing numerous casualties. Despite sustaining significant concussive and shrapnel injuries requiring medical care, all five individuals returned to work virtually without interruption under hazardous security conditions. Brinkley and the four task force members received the Defense of Freedom Medal, the civilian equivalent of the Purple Heart, in response to this incident.\n\nIn May 2010, after four years of work in Iraq and Afghanistan, the work of the Task Force was ruled to be outside of the normal role of the Department of Defense under Title X of the United States Code. Months of Congressional engagement ensued, with Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin and Minority Leader John McCain urging Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in writing to retain the TFBSO. Despite their intervention, Congress passed legislation in December 2010 to move the work of TFBSO into the United States Agency for International Development no later than October 2011 and immediately cease its operations in Iraq and Pakistan. The task force experienced subsequent resignations from most of its senior leadership. Citing inability to rebuild a leadership team for a mission limited to a six month term in Afghanistan, Brinkley resigned July 1, 2011, his departure date coinciding with the retirement of Robert Gates.\n\nIn October 2011, Brinkley co-founded North America Western Asia Holdings (NAWAH), with Thomas Pritzker serving as co-founder and chairman. According to its mission statement, NAWAH will \"respect the history of the nations in which it operates, their culture and their people; commit our own capital to build and sustain great companies; partner equally with regional companies, remaining personally and professionally vested in their long-term success (and will) require our employees, suppliers, and partners operate in a transparent manner, following the highest ethical and international business standards.\" In October, 2012, NAWAH reached an agreement with the Iraqi government to invest up to $14 million to modernize operations at the Port of Maqal in the city of Basra, which has been largely inoperable since the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nIn October 2013, NAWAH announced the reopening of the port, marking less than one year during which NAWAH had rebuilt damaged port infrastructure and hired and trained an Iraqi workforce and management team. The port established a modern container terminal in the city center of Basra and provided a needed gateway for commercial goods into the growing Iraqi economy.\n\nBrinkley is the author of \"War Front to Store Front: Americans Rebuilding Trust and Hope in Nations Under Fire\", published in 2014 by Turner Publishing. The book suggests changes to U.S. foreign policy in war-torn nations based on his seven years bridging the internal dynamics of the Pentagon with the conflict-zone realities of energizing international investment in Iraq and Afghanistan. Brinkley presented the book at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in February 2014.\n"}
{"id": "1730717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1730717", "title": "Pearl Street Station", "text": "Pearl Street Station\n\nPearl Street Station was the first commercial central power plant in the US. It was located at 255-257 Pearl Street in Manhattan on a site measuring , just south of Fulton Street and fired by coal. It began with six dynamos, and it started generating electricity on September 4, 1882, serving an initial load of 400 lamps at 82 customers. By 1884, Pearl Street Station was serving 508 customers with 10,164 lamps. The station was built by the Edison Illuminating Company, which was headed by Thomas Edison. The station was originally powered by custom-made Porter-Allen high-speed steam engines designed to provide 175 horsepower at 700 rpm, but these proved to be unreliable with their sensitive governors. They were removed and replaced with new engines from Armington & Sims that proved to be much more suitable for Edison's dynamos.\n\nPearl Street Station was also the world's first cogeneration plant. While the steam engines provided grid electricity, Edison made use of the thermal byproduct by distributing steam to local manufacturers, and warming nearby buildings on the same Manhattan block.\n\nThe station burned down in 1890, destroying all but one dynamo that is now kept in the Greenfield Village Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.\n\nIn 1929 the Edison Company constructed three scale working models of the station. When a button was pushed, a motor turned the engines, generators, and other equipment in the model. A set of lamps connected to labelled buttons identified the various areas of the building. Cut-outs in the side of the model building allowed examination of the boilers on the first level, reciprocating steam engines and dynamos on the reinforced second level, and the control and test gear on the third and fourth levels. The models were constructed to a scale of one-half inch to the foot and were 62 inches long, 34 inches high and 13 inches wide. The models still exist and are on display at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in Washington, at the Consolidated Edison Learning Center in Long Island City, New York and at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Up to 31 people worked on constructing the models which took about 6 months to complete.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24267812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24267812", "title": "Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim", "text": "Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim\n\nRashid al-Haj Ibrahim () (1889–1953) was a Palestinian Arab banker and a leader of the Independence Party of Palestine (\"al-Istiqlal\"). He was one of the most influential Arab leaders of Haifa in the first half of the 20th century and played a leading role in both the 1936–39 Arab revolt and the 1948 Battle of Haifa.\n\nAl-Haj Ibrahim was born in Haifa in 1889 in the Ottoman Empire to a middle-class mercantile family, al-Haj Ibrahim. The al-Haj Ibrahim family immigrated to Palestine from western North Africa and had a military past. They gained a reputation in trade and commerce and held considerable influence in Haifa. Rashid was mostly self-educated, but he enrolled in Haifa's government-run secondary school and the Alliance School. He learned the Turkish language in addition to Arabic and initially worked in a public debt department, heading the city's trade office in 1913.\n\nAl-Haj Ibrahim would later occupy a post as an official on the Haifa zone of the Hejaz Railway. He gradually became the head of his entire family and gained considerable influence in the city; a common phrase that evolved in the area was \"One cannot talk of Haifa without mentioning Rashid's name.\"\n\nAfter World War I, when the British occupied and took control of Palestine from the Ottomans and established the British Mandate in 1922, al-Haj Ibrahim worked both in commerce and journalism in Haifa. He led the city's Islamic Society, a charitable organization, in 1927, and the local Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA). In order to compete with Local labor parties, by August 1928, al-Haj Ibrahim was in charge of registering Arab laborers and tradesmen to work for employers in government-run building projects, particularly the port expansion scheme in Haifa.\n\nOn August 23, 1930, Arab nationalist organizations met in Nablus—which was holding a general strike protesting a pro-Zionist British policy in Palestine—and elected a committee to help arm the Arab villages against the British occupying army and its atrocities. Al-Haj Ibrahim was tasked to collect funds to purchase weapons. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and head of the Supreme Muslim Council, Haj Amin al-Husseini, requested that al-Haj Ibrahim help Arab youth groups to pray and guard the Al Aqsa Mosque and to secure the site from the Jewish gangs attacks, but al-Haj Ibrahim preferred to focus on condemning the British Mandate decision to draft Zionist youth into the army. In 1931, he established the Haifa branch of the Arab Bank. The salary he earned from managing the bank was supplemented slightly by the income generated from agricultural land he owned west of the city.\n\nHe joined the Istiqlal (Independence) Party—which promoted Arab nationalism and had counterparts in Syria and Iraq—along with Izzat Darwaza and Awni Abd al-Hadi when it was founded in 1932. The party held a congress in Acre in 1932 which al-Haj Ibrahim presided over. He was designated the leader of the party's branch in Haifa. In late 1932, he resigned from his position in the Haifa Islamic Society. According to the \"Filastin\" newspaper, he did so in protest of the sacking of Sheikh Kamil al-Qassab as the society's director of schools. It was also speculated al-Haj Ibrahim quit because of the society's dominance by al-Husayni who was reportedly aiming to undermine the al-Istiqlal party because of its rising popularity. However, he remained intensely involved in Haifa's YMMA whose leadership was intertwined with that of the Islamic Society. Under his leadership, Haifa became an al-Istiqlal stronghold. In line with the party's policy to expand the Arabic values, al-Haj Ibrahim became one of many investors to form an Arabic film company that would open cinemas in Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, and Amman in 1934.\n\nStarting in the late 1920s, al-Haj Ibrahim became the closest political associate of Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, a religious leader from Syria who led an uprising activities against the occupying British military and Jewish gangs in Palestine. Because al-Qassam was frequently detained and tortured by the British authorities, al-Haj Ibrahim appealed to him several times to maintain his position; he would frequently negotiate with the British authorities To release al-Qassam. In 1935, al-Qassam was killed by the occupying British forces in an assault near Jenin, an action that would provoke the 1936–39 Arab uprising in Palestine in which al-Haj Ibrahim was a chief activist.\n\nDue to his role in the uprising, he was exiled to the Seychelles in 1936. Following a conference in London in 1939, al-Haj Ibrahim was among the Palestinian notables invited by Muhammad Mahmoud Pasha, the Prime Minister of Egypt, to discuss and modify the British White Paper—which called for a united Palestine led by both Palestinian Arabs and Jews in proportion to their population ratio. Al-Haj Ibrahim returned to Palestine in February 1940. In order to further their political influence, the Istiqlalists with al-Haj Ibrahim as their leader, negotiated with Abdullah I of Jordan to gain the support of his partisans in Palestine as a counterweight to al-Husayni's supporters.\n\nHostilities between Jews and Arabs in Palestine erupted as the British withdrew in mid-1947. In Haifa, a 14-member National Committee (NC) was established on December 2, with al-Haj Ibrahim as its chairman. He led the committee until its disestablishment in April 1948 during the thick of the war. He wrote to al-Husayni the \"Arab world faces destruction [because]... the Jews want to take over [ Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan, Iraq, and the Hejaz ].\" According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, he believed that the Jews would establish a \"giant\" navy and air force and built atomic weapons with which to spread fear among the Arab people. Nonetheless, from the beginning of hostilities in December 1947, al-Haj Ibrahim encouraged moderation and pursued a ceasefire between the Arab and Jewish paramilitary forces, declaring the \"Arabs were interested in quiet in Haifa...\"\n\nOpposition with al-Husayni's policies in the city mounted with al-Haj Ibrahim threatening to leave the city along with all of its senior politicians if al-Husayni continued to order attacks against Jewish forces there. Many senior politicians, including 11 out of the 15 NC members, had already left the city despite persuasion by al-Haj Ibrahim to remain in the city and help the Arab inhabitants face Jewish irregulars. Nonetheless, he left Palestine himself in early April 1948. He did so apparently after quarreling with the Lebanese Druze commander of the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) in Haifa, Amin Izz al-Din Nabahani.\n\nAl-Haj Ibrahim moved to Amman, Jordan after fleeing Haifa upon its capture by Jewish forces. He wrote memoirs of his experience in Palestine from 1947 to the early 1950s. They mostly outlined the responsibility of the Palestinian leadership regarding the circumstances of the city's fall, and exposing its performance and political discourse during the British Mandate period. Al-Haj Ibrahim died in Amman in 1953, and was buried in Damascus, Syria. Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi edited and published his memoirs, titled \"Defending Haifa and the Problem of Palestine: The Memoirs of Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, 1891-1953\", in the Institute for Palestine Studies, Beirut, in 2006.\n\n"}

He has worked at Occidental Petroleum for over 20 years, serving as a director since 1984, chief operating officer (president) from 1984 to 1990, and chairman and chief executive officer from 1990. During his early years, he worked with notable Occidental CEO Armand Hammer, who at age 91, named Irani his successor in February 1990. According to Forbes.com, his five-year total compensation between 2001 and 2005 was $127,447,000. In 2006, after a rise in oil prices, Irani earned a total of $460 million.\n\nIrani was born in Lebanon and is of Palestinian origin. He received a bachelor of science degree in chemistry at the American University of Beirut in 1953. He moved in the same year to Los Angeles, California, and at age 18, began graduate studies in physical chemistry at the University of Southern California. He received his PhD in 1957. He subsequently worked as a researcher for the Monsanto Company until 1967 and joined the Shamrock Corporation. Prior to working for Occidental, he was president and chief operating officer of Olin Corporation, a chemicals and metals company.\n\nIrani is an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Chemists and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

He was recognized \"for leadership in the petrochemical industry and processes for applications of particulate systems.\" This is considered the highest honor in engineering in the United States.\n\nIrani was brought to Occidental in 1983 to help its struggling chemicals division, and soon was promoted to president, replacing a series of presidents fired by Hammer. By 1988, the media reported that Irani and his team were running the day-to-day operations of the company on behalf of the then 90-year-old Hammer. In 2008 Irani was awarded options worth $392 million.\n\nIrani made news in 2007, when it was revealed that his total compensation for the 2006 year topped $450 million. His base salary was $1.3 million. Occidental justified the compensation by pointing to the stock price, which had risen from $9 a share when Irani succeeded Hammer to $48.60 at the end of 2006, and to the company's market capitalization, which grew from $32.1 billion at the end of 2005 to $42.5 billion at the end of 2006. His compensation in 2009 totaled $31.4 million, including $1,170,000 in salary and $24,758,827 in stock. According to the Associated Press, within the last decade, Irani has received $857 million.\nIrani put funds into an overseas tax shelter arranged by Deutsche Bank AG that the IRS later deemed an illegal tax avoidance scheme. The Occidental Chairman opposed the U.S. Department of Justice subpoena of Deutsche Bank AG records as part of an investigation of myCFO Inc. His appeal was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2006. Occidental's Board of Directors took no action against Irani despite the IRS ruling. An Occidental spokesman said that Irani's participation in the tax avoidance scheme was a personal matter and was not a violation of the company's code of conduct policy.\n\nIrani was awarded a $900,000 cash bonus by the Occidental board of directors for exceptional performance in implementing a cost-cutting initiative (including reduction in force job terminations) in anticipation of a \"world-wide economic deterioration.\" This was awarded on a discretionary basis by the Occidental compensation committee and not by any company performance metrics. Chazen collected $38,080,344 and Irani $76,107,010 in fiscal year 2010, nearly doubling his 2009 compensation despite shareholder outrage over the Occidental board of directors executive pay policies.\n\nIrani retired as CEO on May 10, 2011 after the California State Teachers' Retirement System and Relational Investors, two major institutional Occidental Investors, objected to the company's compensation policies and announced plans to replace long-term board members who were described as \"ossified\" in a letter written in protest of Irani's salary. They also termed Irani's salary a \"corporate giveaway program.\"\n\nIrani's salary was considered excessive and not truly performance based for decades by a number of corporate governance authorities who noted that Irani's compensation had exceeded that of the head of energy giant ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, who leads a company that has a market cap that is five times larger than Occidental Petroleum.\n\nIn 2010, former CFO and later President Stephen Chazen was named CEO of Occidental to replace Irani, who planned to stay on as executive Chairman until 2014.\n\nIrani was removed from the board of directors of Occidental on May 3, 2013.\n\nIrani was a KB Home director for 15 years until November 2007. Irani chaired the KB Home executive compensation committee during the time period when CEO Bruce Karatz lied about the company's practice of backdating options. Karatz was subsequently indicted and convicted April 21, 2010 on Federal charges stemming from his actions and sanctioned by the SEC in a separate civil action. The KB Home shareholders expressed their lack of confidence in the board and the compensation committee by a 19% opposition vote against Irani, who resigned from the KB Home board of directors after 15 years of service. Occidental offered no explanation for his resignation in their proxy statement.\n\n"}

It simulates truck driving and management along with associated business strategic activities, and features some of the best known trucks in North America (list below). The game takes place in California and Nevada, in the year 2014.\n\nThe game was published by 1C and developed by SoftLab-NSK's Igor Belago, who was inspired by games like Grand Theft Auto. \"Rig'n'Roll\" also includes a program for the creation of skins for trucks, license plates, and trailers. Gameplay modes include racing, single-player missions, regular truck driving, and free cruising.\n\nThis game is also called \"Hard Truck 3: Rig'N'Roll\" but the name \"Hard Truck\" was removed after the prequel \"\".\n\nUnlike most sandbox games, ignoring a story mission for too long will end the game abruptly.\n\nAfter completing the story missions, Nick can focus on expanding his trucking company, with his goal being to win the award for having the most successful company at a certain in-game date. If he succeeds, he receives a large cash reward. Failure to do so results in a \"Game Over\" screen although the player can continue playing the game with no penalties.\n\nRig'n'Roll offers a lot of road exploration based on real-life locations, with multiple missions to be completed and places to visit in non-linear environments. Management in this game is done by using sliders, and much of the game is focused around cargo/truck selection and choosing routes. To start missions, the player drives into a warehouse and chooses either a normal delivery to another warehouse (which can be a solo delivery or a competition against AI opponents; the highest payment goes to whoever reaches the destination first) or a race with other truck drivers. Every delivery has a time limit, and the payment will be deducted if the player's truck hits anything while delivering fragile goods. While on the roads, players can interact with NPCs (e.g. hitchhikers) and take on sidequests.\n\nFor the management part of the game, the player is able to hire or fire drivers, adjust driver AI behavior for both trucks and cargoes, upgrade their fleet of trucks, view rankings list, improve truck rating statistics, manage and expand their business economy at freight management offices, warehouses, and via a PDA device known as \"Black Shark\". Each driver has his or her own preferences for options such as choosing to make long or short distance deliveries, whether they should deliver fragile goods and how often they should participate in races. Changing the AI behavior may increase the amount of money the driver earns for the company per day but it may sometimes cause his or her loyalty to drop.\n\nAlthough there are no speed limits on any of the in-game roads, there is a heavy emphasis on following traffic laws while driving. In addition to hitting other vehicles, the player can be pulled over and fined by the police for offences like driving at night with the headlights off, driving in the wrong direction and not giving right of way. Committing an offence will usually trigger a pursuit by a police car even if there are none around at the time when the offence took place.\n\nThe list of featured trucks in the game:\n\nThis game was in development for over 9 years due to the developer of the game focusing mainly on making hardware/software equipment for multimedia, TV broadcasting, VR systems, imaging systems for training simulators, and video game engines for computer games.\n\nBefore release, it was also featured at E3 2005, Gamescom, as well as several other Russian gaming exhibitions and developer conferences. A demo was announced for 2009 and then for 2010, but both scheduled dates were canceled. All cheats were taken out of the game prior to release. Also, modding possibilities, trainer usage, save file hex-editing and hacking of the game were somewhat restricted.\n\nRig 'n' Roll supports AMD Eyefinity-based multi-monitor set-ups.\nNokia alone\n\nRig'n'Roll has so far received mostly fair to positive (mixed) reviews on the Metacritic/GameRankings sites respectively, praising the game for its realistic graphics in depicting the Californian scenery, impressive physics, truck designs, music soundtrack, intuitive controls, mission structure, and gameplay variety. The game was also criticized because of its truck-driving simulation aspects feeling too \"arcadey\", for having a weak in-game tutorial, a lack of multiplayer, and for frequent delays in development.\n\nVoice acting for Rig'n'Roll was done in English, except for the Russian version. The list below (in brackets) only tells what language the subtitles, text, and menus will be displayed in.\n\nPatches to improve system performance and optimization were released for Russian version of game. All other versions have these patches included already (hotfixes must be applied manually). The latest patch for Rig'n'Roll Russian version is currently \"3.0.5\". English US retail is \"3.0.4\", while the English version hotfix for some downloaded versions is \"3.0.1\". So any boxed retail version that is newer than the Russian version will have a version number that is greater than the previous release of the game and the latest patch. This can be confirmed while at the main menu, or by looking at the file version properties of the game's executable.\n\nNewer patches to fix additional bugs are reported to only be included in the upcoming expansions, so players would have to buy the expansion first to get the patch. However, as for today, no more patches were released, and game has been probably abandoned by developer.\n\nSoftLab-Nsk had plans to expand the game map to Las Vegas, according to advertisement banners that were put up along the roads and highways of California. Content included in this expansion was rumored to contain a patch for the game to fix certain bugs, as well as to add a few more trucks, hitchhiker/storyline missions, and gameplay features such as pedestrians that were either missing or deactivated in the original game. The expansion pack along with the patch were planned to be released at the same time as a free download, but rumors have been reported that they were planned to be actually released at a cost - either through an online digital download service provider or at a retail game store. More information on the expansion and a possible release date is not disclosed, and addon itself is rumored to be permanently cancelled by developer or publisher.\n\nNot many addons were released for Rig'n'Roll. One addon was however released, and second one is yet unknown. They include airbursh kits and more gameplay content to supplement the game's Sandbox-style driving open world. The biggest addon is \"The Great Race\" — a total file size of 578.85МB. Las Vegas addon release date is unknown, but there is a rumor that it has been cancelled by developer or publisher.\n\nThe very first major Black Shark add-on modification for Rig'n'Roll: The Great Race, according to 1CPublishing, is expected to be released on December 2010 in time for the Christmas holidays, or Q1 2011 for all English version copies of the game as DLC. The Russian version for TGR is scheduled for release on November 12, 2010. This addon will feature more of CCWA's Big Rigs championship event called the \"Monster Cup\", which focuses more on allowing players to compete in several arcade-style truck races with selectable map tracks, rather than just in the usual \"pick, choose & deliver\" truck tycoon management RPG-style gameplay approach. 8\n\nThe Monster Cup focuses on arcade racing across all of California and a bit of Nevada. Its races are long distance and go anywhere from 10 minutes to 40 minutes. It has eight leagues:\n\n1 - 5th League\n\n2nd - 4th League\n\n3rd - 3rd League\n\n4th - 2nd League\n\n5th - 1st League\n\n6th - Premier League\n\n7th - Championship League\n\n8th - Monster League\n\nAirbrush kits to wipe or paint the color and dye of your truck to your preference. It is available in the game's repair truckstop as a way of creating skins.\n\n"}
{"id": "318949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318949", "title": "Root cause analysis", "text": "Root cause analysis\n\nRoot cause analysis (RCA) is a method of problem solving used for identifying the root causes of faults or problems. A factor is considered a root cause if removal thereof from the problem-fault-sequence prevents the final undesirable outcome from recurring; whereas a causal factor is one that affects an event's outcome, but is not a root cause. Though removing a causal factor can benefit an outcome, it does not prevent its recurrence with certainty.\n\nEssentially it is based on four general principles, extended throughout this article:\n\n\nRCA is applied to methodically identify and correct the root causes of events, rather than to simply address the symptomatic result. Focusing correction on root causes has the goal of entirely preventing problem recurrence. Conversely, RCFA (Root Cause Failure Analysis) recognizes that complete prevention of recurrence by one corrective action is not always possible.\n\nRCA is typically used as a reactive method of identifying event(s) causes, revealing problems and solving them. Analysis is done \"after\" an event has occurred. Insights in RCA make it potentially useful as a preemptive method. In that event, RCA can be used to \"forecast\" or predict probable events even \"before\" they occur. While one follows the other, RCA is a completely separate process to incident management.\n\nFor example, imagine a fictional segment of students who received poor testing scores. After initial investigation, it was verified that students taking tests in the final period of the school day got lower scores. Further investigation revealed that late in the day, the students lacked ability to focus. Even further investigation revealed that the reason for the lack of focus was hunger. So, the root cause of the poor testing scores was hunger, remedied by moving the testing time to soon after lunch.\n\nAs another example, imagine an investigation into a machine that stopped because it overloaded and the fuse blew. Investigation shows that the machine overloaded because it had a bearing that wasn't being sufficiently lubricated. The investigation proceeds further and finds that the automatic lubrication mechanism had a pump which was not pumping sufficiently, hence the lack of lubrication. Investigation of the pump shows that it has a worn shaft. Investigation of why the shaft was worn discovers that there isn't an adequate mechanism to prevent metal scrap getting into the pump. This enabled scrap to get into the pump, and damage it. The root cause of the problem is therefore that metal scrap can contaminate the lubrication system. Fixing this problem ought to prevent the whole sequence of events recurring. Compare this with an investigation that does not find the root cause: replacing the fuse, the bearing, or the lubrication pump will probably allow the machine to go back into operation for a while. But there is a risk that the problem will simply recur, until the root cause is dealt with.\n\nNote that \"root causes\" are likely to have many levels, and the analysis terminates at a level that is \"root\" only to the eyes of the current investigator. Looking at the second example, a deeper level root cause is that the maintenance procedures at the plant included periodic inspection of the lubrication subsystem every two years, while the current lubrication subsystem vendor's product specified a 6-month period. Switching vendors may have been due to management's desire to save money, and a failure to consult with cognizant engineering staff on the implication of the change, and so on.\n\nThus, while the \"root cause\" shown above may have prevented the quoted recurrence, it would not have prevented other perhaps more severe future failures.\n\nQuite often, \"engineering-type\" root cause analysis stops at the engineering level, and fails to go down to deeper, organizational roots.\n\nRoot cause analysis is used in ITIL, a set of detailed practices for IT service management, where the analysis is performed to resolve a recurring incident by the problem manager. Within computer security incident management, root cause analysis may be called security investigation and analysis.\n\nRather than one sharply defined methodology, RCA comprises many different tools, processes, and philosophies. However, several very-broadly defined approaches or \"schools\" can be identified by their basic approach or field of origin: safety-based, production-based, assembly-based, process-based, failure-based, and systems-based.\n\n\nDespite the different approaches among the various schools of root cause analysis, all share some common principles. Several general processes for performing RCA can also be defined.\n\n\nRCA (in steps 3, 4 and 5) forms the most critical part of successful corrective action, directing the corrective action at the true root cause of the problem. Knowing the root cause is secondary to the goal of prevention, as it is not possible to determine an absolutely effective corrective action for the defined problem without knowing the root cause.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "608994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=608994", "title": "The Corporation (2003 film)", "text": "The Corporation (2003 film)\n\nThe Corporation is a 2003 Canadian documentary film written by University of British Columbia law professor Joel Bakan, and directed by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott. The documentary examines the modern-day corporation. Bakan wrote the book, \"The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power\", during the filming of the documentary.\n\nThe documentary shows the development of the contemporary business corporation, from a legal entity that originated as a government-chartered institution meant to affect specific public functions to the rise of the modern commercial institution entitled to most of the legal rights of a person. The documentary concentrates mostly upon North American corporations, especially those in the United States. One theme is its assessment of corporations as persons, as a result of an 1886 case in the United States Supreme Court in which a statement by Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite led to corporations as \"persons\" having the same rights as human beings, based on the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nTopics addressed include the Business Plot, where in 1933, General Smedley Butler exposed an alleged corporate plot against then U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt; the tragedy of the commons; Dwight D. Eisenhower's warning people to beware of the rising military-industrial complex; economic externalities; suppression of an investigative news story about Bovine Growth Hormone on Fox affiliate television station WTVT in Tampa, Florida at the behest of Monsanto; the invention of the soft drink Fanta by The Coca-Cola Company due to the trade embargo on Nazi Germany; the alleged role of IBM in the Nazi holocaust (see IBM and the Holocaust); the Cochabamba protests of 2000 brought on by the privatization of a municipal water supply in Bolivia; and in general themes of corporate social responsibility, the notion of limited liability, the corporation as a psychopath, and the corporate personhood debate.\n\nThrough vignettes and interviews, \"The Corporation\" examines and criticizes corporate business practices. The film's assessment is affected via the diagnostic criteria in the \"DSM-IV\"; Robert D. Hare, a University of British Columbia psychology professor and a consultant to the FBI, compares the profile of the contemporary profitable business corporation to that of a clinically diagnosed psychopath (however, Hare has objected to the manner in which his views are portrayed in the film; see \"Critical reception\" below). \"The Corporation\" attempts to compare the way corporations are systematically compelled to behave with what it claims are the \"DSM-IV\"s symptoms of psychopathy, e.g., the callous disregard for the feelings of other people, the incapacity to maintain human relationships, the reckless disregard for the safety of others, the deceitfulness (continual lying to deceive for profit), the incapacity to experience guilt, and the failure to conform to social norms and respect the law.\n\nThe film features interviews with prominent corporate critics such as Noam Chomsky, Charles Kernaghan, Naomi Klein, Michael Moore, Vandana Shiva, and Howard Zinn, as well as opinions from company CEOs such as Ray Anderson (from the Interface carpet and fabric company), and viewpoints from business gurus Peter Drucker and Milton Friedman, and think tanks advocating free markets such as the Fraser Institute. Interviews also feature Dr. Samuel Epstein, who was involved in a lawsuit against Monsanto Company for promoting the use of Posilac, (Monsanto's trade name for recombinant Bovine Somatotropin) to induce more milk production in dairy cattle and Chris Barrett who, as a spokesperson for First USA, was the first corporately sponsored college student in America.\n\n\"The Corporation\" grossed around $3.5 million in American box office receipts and had a worldwide gross of over $4.8 million, making it the second top-grossing film for Zeitgeist Films.\n\nThe extended edition made for TVOntario (TVO) separates the documentary into three 1-hour episodes:\n\nThe DVD version was released as a 2-disc set that includes following:\n\n\nIn 2012, a new Canadian educational version was released for high school students. This \"Occupy Your Future\" version is exclusively distributed by Hello Cool World, who were behind the branding and grassroots outreach of the original film in four countries. This version is shorter and breaks the film into three parts. The extras include interviews with Joel Bakan on the Occupy movement, Katherine Dodds on social branding, and two short films from Annie Leonard's \"Story of Stuff\" Project.\n\nFilm critics gave the film generally favorable reviews. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 111 reviews with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Corporation\" is a satisfyingly dense, thought-provoking rebuttal to some of capitalism's central arguments.\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 28 reviews.\n\nIn \"Variety\" (October 1, 2003), Dennis Harvey praised the film's \"surprisingly cogent, entertaining, even rabble-rousing indictment of perhaps the most influential institutional model for our era\" and its avoidance of \"a sense of excessively partisan rhetoric\" by deploying a wide range of interviewees and \"a bold organizational scheme that lets focus jump around in interconnective, humorous, hit-and-run fashion.\"\n\nIn the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" (July 16, 2004), Roger Ebert described the film as \"an impassioned polemic, filled with information sure to break up any dinner-table conversation,\" but felt that \"at 145 minutes, it overstays its welcome. The wise documentarian should treat film stock as a non-renewable commodity.\"\n\n\"The Economist\" review, while calling the film \"a surprisingly rational and coherent attack on capitalism's most important institution\" and \"a thought-provoking account of the firm\", calls it incomplete. It suggests that the idea for an organization as a psychopathic entity originated with Max Weber, in regards to government bureaucracy. The reviewer remarks that the film weighs heavily in favor of public ownership as a solution to the evils depicted, while failing to acknowledge the magnitude of evils committed by governments in the name of public ownership, such as those of the Communist Party in the former Soviet Union or by monarchies and the Church.\n\nAn interview clip with psychiatrist Robert D. Hare appears for several minutes in \"The Corporation\". A pioneer in psychopathy research whose Hare Psychopathy Checklist is used in part to \"diagnose\" purportedly psychopathic behavior of corporations in the documentary, Hare has since objected to the manner in which his work was presented in the film and the use of his work to bolster what he describes as the film's questionable thesis and conclusions. In \"\" (2007; co-written with Paul Babiak), Hare writes that despite claims by the filmmakers to him during production that they were using psychopathy metaphorically to describe \"the most egregious\" corporate misbehavior, the finished documentary obviously intends to imply that corporations in general or by definition are psychopathic, a claim that Hare emphatically rejects:\n\nHowever, in his monologue in \"The Corporation\" and the transcript with added comments, Hare, in addition to pointing out differences between corporations, clearly uses generalized terms such as \"tend\", \"most\", \"almost\", \"routinely\", \"much the same\", \"almost by their very nature\", and \"by definition\" with regard to numerous of his characterizations of psychopathy applying to corporations. Nonetheless, Hare insists that his guarded, qualified comments on the \"academic exercise\" of diagnosing certain corporations as psychopathic was used in support of a larger thesis that he was not informed in advance about and with which he did not agree.\n\nThe film was nominated for over 26 international awards including the World Cinema Audience Award: Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004, a Special Jury Award at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) in 2003 and a Genie Award - Documentary in 2005.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1263166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1263166", "title": "The Diamond Smugglers", "text": "The Diamond Smugglers\n\nThe Diamond Smugglers is a non-fiction work by Ian Fleming that was first published in 1957 in the United Kingdom and in 1958 in the United States. The book is based on two weeks of interviews Fleming undertook with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO), which was headed by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-chief of MI5 who worked exclusively for the diamond company De Beers.\n\nThe IDSO was formed by Sillitoe to combat the smuggling of diamonds from Africa, where, it was estimated, £10 million (£ in 2018 pounds) worth of gems were being smuggled out of South Africa alone every year. The book expands upon articles Fleming wrote for \"The Sunday Times\" in 1957.\n\nFleming was better known as the author of a series of books about his super-spy creation, James Bond; \"The Diamond Smugglers\" is one of two non-fiction books he wrote. It was broadly well-received, although some reviewers commented on the stories not being new.\n\n\"The Diamond Smugglers\" is the account of Ian Fleming's meeting with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO). The book takes the form of background narrative by Fleming of where the two men met, interspersed with the interview between Fleming and Collard, who is introduced under the pseudonym of \"John Blaize\".\n\nCollard relates how he was recruited into the IDSO by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, under whom Collard had worked. The book goes on to look at the activities of the IDSO from the end of 1954 until the operation was closed down in April 1957, when its job was complete. Collard explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of De Beers, Sir Philip Oppenheimer, after an Interpol report stated that £10 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from Sierra Leone, Portuguese West Africa, the Gold Coast and Tanganyika.\n\nAs well as providing a history of the IDSO's operations, Collard relates a number of illustrative vignettes concerning the diamond smuggling cases he and the organisation dealt with.\n\nFleming became interested in diamond smuggling after reading an article in \"The Sunday Times\" in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished. In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for De Beers and investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming met Sillitoe and used much of the research as background material for his fictional Bond novel, \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\n\nFleming retained an interest in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of \"The Sunday Times\", Denis Hamilton, that the paper may want to write a story on the International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he played a major role in the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.\n\nFleming and Collard met in Tangiers on 13 April 1957; Fleming considered Collard to be a \"reluctant hero, like all Britain's best secret agents\". The pair spent two weeks discussing the issue of diamond smuggling, with Collard explaining what happened in South Africa and Sierra Leone. Fleming would then dictate an average of 5,000 words a day to a secretary.\n\nWhen the drafts of the books were shown to De Beers they objected to a number of areas and threatened an injunction against Fleming and \"The Sunday Times\", which resulted in much material being removed. \"The Sunday Times\" serialised the book over six weeks, starting on 15 September 1957 and finishing on 20 October 1957.\n\n\"The Diamond Smugglers\" was published in the UK in November 1957, by Jonathan Cape, was 160 pages long and cost 12 shillings 6d. The book was published in the US on 13 May 1958, by Macmillan and cost $3.50.\n\nThe book received largely positive reviews. Michael Crampton, writing for \"The Sunday Times\" considered it an \"exciting and richly fascinating account\" and thought Fleming authored a book that \"ringing true as fact, is at the same time as highly entertaining as any fiction.\" \"The Times Literary Supplement\" obtained the services of the Earl of Cardigan to review the book. He noted that \"the book is put together with a skill one would expect from Mr. Fleming\", which leads to something that is \"very entertaining reading\".\n\nReviewing for \"The Observer\", Anthony Sampson thought the book had \"sparkle\", adding that \"it is often difficult to remember that we are not listening to his old hero Mr. James Bond.\" Sampson noted that the book included \"several yarns which are worthy of the best spy-stories\". The reviewer for \"The Economist\" enjoyed the book, but considered that while many of the stories \"make good reading ... they are not new\". For \"The New York Times\", John Barkham thought that Fleming's foray into non-fiction produced \"mixed results\". Although he found the subject interesting, the basis in interview resulted in a \"choppy book\" that was \"no more than an interim report\".\n\nShortly after publication, The Rank Group offered £13,500 (£ in 2018 pounds) for the film rights to the book, which Fleming accepted, telling them he would write a full story outline for an extra £1,000. Several contemporary newspaper reports referred to the project as \"The Diamond Spy\". British producer George Willoughby subsequently obtained the rights for the book from Rank and tried to make a film with the actor Richard Todd, eventually commissioning a screenplay from Australian writer Jon Cleary, who finished a script in October 1964 that remained faithful in spirit to Fleming's book while also featuring elements familiar from the James Bond films. Kingsley Amis was also hired as a story consultant; in a letter to author Theo Richmond on 20 December 1965 Amis wrote he was having 'a horrible time' of writing an outline for Willoughby. W.H. \"Bill\" Canaway, co-author of the screenplay for The Ipcress File, was also hired to work on the script. At one point, film director John Boorman was involved. Despite interest from Anglo-Amalgamated Film Distributors and Anglo Embassy Productions in early 1966, the project was shelved later that year.\n\n"}

The first section focuses on the perspective of the entrepreneurs, the second on the venture capitalists, and the third on what Gompers and Lerner call 'the emulators', organizations that try to copy the venture capital model.\n\nIn the first section, the authors identify the challenges entrepreneurs face when trying to raise capital: (1) \"uncertainty\" about the future; (2) \"information gaps\" about the new product and the market for it; (3) the predominance of \"soft assets\" (e.g. patents, trade secrets), in contrast to hard assets (e.g. land, equipment) that are easier to finance; and (4) the volatility of the \"product- and financial market conditions\". The authors then explain how VCs addresses these problems: screening mechanisms, due diligence, staged financing, syndicated investment, executive compensation rules, financing covenants like convertible debt, and corporate governance mechanisms are some of the solutions employed and discussed in the book.\n\nIn the second section, the authors focus on venture capital organizations. This section is part a historical account about the VC industry in United States, beginning with the founding of the first modern VC firm, American Research and Development Corporation, by MIT president Karl Compton and HBS professor Georges Doriot, in 1946. It also explores subsequent VC booms to the federally guaranteed Small Business Investment Companies Program in the 1960s and the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, allowing a \"prudent man\" to hold some high-risk investments and increasing the flow of institutional money into the VC business. This section also describes the ways in which venture capital is structured, connecting its success to the limited partnership structure (e.g. management fees, carried interests, contractual restrictions); the mechanisms to raise funds and the emergence of the fund of funds; and the challenges of the regulators to grapple with its information gap problems. The section closes with a detailed study of the overshooting phenomena that explains the volatility of the returns of the industry.\n\nThe third section of the book looks at efforts to apply the principles of venture investing in corporate, public sector, educational, and international settings. The authors argue that the lack of adequate compensation schemes and organizational structures usually limit the success of the venture capital model in these settings.\n\nRandall Morck, an academic in the field, says that the book is \"accessible to undergraduates and MBAs with little economics and to the general reader\", but recommends \"The Venture Capital Cycle\" (Paul Gompers and Josh Lerner 1999, Cambridge: MIT Press) from the same authors for a high-level academic treatment of the same issues. He further states that the book may be interesting to economists, explaining that \"the familiar problems of agency cost, information asymmetry, adverse selection, and moral hazard assume overarching importance in the VC business.\" He praises the book for giving \"clarifying to these problems\", being useful to \"counterweight the more traditional presentation of these issues\".\n\nReviewers also say that the authors \"are strong supporters of the venture capital model\", and hence \"the reader is left with little doubt that the VC business has managed the trick at least tolerably well.\" George Kingston points out that the book was published prior to the stock market downturn of the internet bubble and \"it does not address the impact of these events on venture capital\".\n"}

After an ill-fated attempt to resolve the club's debts, he was finally succeeded by Manuel Llorente.\n\nHaving started out in the orange export business, in the 1990s he got involved in construction as a real estate broker, and subsequently as a property developer and representative of large investor groups.\n\nHe entered the world of soccer in 2004 when forming part of Paco Roig's \"Cor i Força\", the team that was running against then ousted president Jaume Ortí. Juan Bautista Soler won the election and Soriano accepted the role offered of vice-president.\n\nSoriano was charged with the selection of plans for the new stadium (see Nou Mestalla). Finally Soler rejected said projects. As a result, his relations with the then-president deteriorated. He was relieved of the vice-presidency in January 2006, although never he sold his allocation of shares. He resigned from the board in June 2007. He threatened to return to the club accompanied by Juan Villalonga to get a hold of Soler's stock, a situation that did not bear fruit. Villalonga briefly took over the running of the club in 2008, but when he proposed to buy the 37% held by Soler, Soriano reconciled with the majority shareholder and reached an agreement for the buying and selling of the Soler family shares in an amount set at 70.7 million euros, which was overturned after Soriano failed to sell the old Mestalla ground by the end of the year, finally resigning on 4 June 2009 because he had still failed to sell it. An attempt to raise capital by improving income from television rights also failed. \n\nHowever, following an absence of just one month, during which time Manuel Llorente took over, Soriano returned in July, having gained 51% of the shares and linked up with a mysterious company called Inversiones Dalport, an investment company supposedly from Uruguay but with an office in Madrid. Soriano announced that none of the star players such as David Villa, Juan Manuel Mata or David Silva would now need to be sold, as all the debts would be wiped clean. \n\nHowever, failure to find any information on Dalport on the Internet prior to the announcement prompted an outcry at the press conference. The media's suspicions were further heightened when fans noticed that the logo of an eagle used by Dalport had in fact been copied from a children's colouring-in book. Prematurely ousted president Llorente echoed the fans' suspicions Like 70% of fans, Llorente does not believe that Soriano will deliver, and warned that Valencia is opening themselves up to a potential investment scam.\n\nWhen, as predicted, Dalport failed to deliver, on August 21, 2009 Fundació VCF took over, becoming the main shareholder with 72.5% of shares, using a loan from Bancaixa and guaranteed by the local government. The Fundació is not allowed to end up with less than 51%, thereby ensuring stability within Valencia CF and cementing Manuel Llorente as the bona fide president.\n\nIn 2014, Soler hired a hitman from Eastern Europe to kidnap Soriano. However, the hitman turned out to be working for the police, so Soler was arrested. While he is waiting to find out whether he will go to prison, he is not allowed to leave the country or go within 15 metres of Vicente Soriano. This will not be easy, as his home is 20 metres from the door of Soriano's office.\n\n"}

{"id": "374969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=374969", "title": "Vincent Astor", "text": "Vincent Astor\n\nWilliam Vincent Astor (November 15, 1891 – February 3, 1959) was a businessman, philanthropist, and member of the prominent Astor family.\n\nCalled Vincent, he was born in New York City on November 15, 1891. He was the son of John Jacob Astor IV, millionaire and inventor and his first wife, Ava Lowle Willing, an heiress from Philadelphia.\n\nHe graduated from St. George's School, in Middletown, Rhode Island, in 1910 and attended Harvard University from 1911 to 1912, leaving school without graduating.\n\nLike his father, Astor belonged to the New York Society of Colonial Wars. He served as commodore of the New York Yacht Club from 1928 to 1930.\n\nAstor was interested in trains. In the early 1930s, he established an estate in Bermuda which included a private narrow-gauge railway and union station with the Bermuda Railway. The estate is now divided between several private owners, none of whom are part of the Astor family. As recently as 1992, the remains of some of his rolling stock were visible.\n\nVincent Astor was, according to family biographer Derek Wilson, \"a hitherto unknown phenomenon in America: an Astor with a highly developed social conscience.\" He was 20 when his father died, and, having inherited a massive fortune, dropped out of Harvard University. He set about to change the family image from that of miserly, aloof slum landlords who enjoyed the good life at the expense of others. Over time, he sold off the family's New York City slum housing and reinvested in reputable enterprises while spending a great deal of time and energy helping others. He was responsible for the construction of a large housing complex in the Bronx that included sufficient land for a large children's playground, and in Harlem, he transformed a valuable piece of real estate into another playground for children.\n\nAstor appeared as No. 12 on the first list of America's richest people, compiled by \"Forbes\" magazine. His net worth at the time was estimated at $75 million.\n\nAmongst his holdings was \"Newsweek\" magazine which had for a time its headquarters in the former Knickerbocker Hotel that had been built by his father; he was the magazine's chairman. He also inherited Ferncliff, the Astor family's estate near Rhinebeck, New York, where his father had been born. Vincent Astor, however, would be the last family owner of the estate and occupant of the \"Ferncliff Casino\", a Stanford White—McKim Mead & White designed 1904 Beaux Arts style building, inspired by the Grand Trianon at Versailles.\n\nOn his death in 1959, Astor bequeathed a main house at Ferncliff to the Benedictine Hospital in Kingston, New York, and later his widow, Brooke, donated \"Ferncliff Casino\" to the Catholic Archdiocese of New York, and sold off many parcels of the estate. In 1963, Homer Staley, a local retired businessman in the area, asked Brooke Astor to preserve the remaining natural acreage of woodlands from development. She donated the land to the Rotary Club of Rhinebeck, to become the Ferncliff Forest Game Refuge and Forest Preserve.\n\nAstor married Helen Dinsmore Huntington, on April 30, 1914. At the ceremony, he was stricken with the mumps, a disease that made him sterile; as for the bride, her friend Glenway Wescott, the novelist, admiringly described her in his unpublished diaries as \"a grand, old-fashioned lesbian.\" The couple divorced in 1940. A year later, Helen became the second wife of Lytle Hull (1882–1958), a real-estate broker who was a friend and business associate of her former husband.\n\nShortly after his divorce, Astor married Mary Benedict Cushing, the eldest daughter of Dr. Harvey Williams Cushing and Katharine Stone Crowell. Mary's sisters were Betsey Maria Cushing and Barbara \"Babe\" Cushing. They divorced in September 1953, and the following month, Mary wed James Whitney Fosburgh, a painter who worked as an art lecturer at the Frick Museum.\n\nOn October 8, 1953, several weeks after divorcing his second wife, Astor married the once-divorced, once-widowed Roberta Brooke Russell. According to an often-told story in society circles, Astor agreed to divorce his second wife only after she had found him a replacement spouse. Her first suggestion was Janet Newbold Ryan Stewart Bush, the newly divorced wife of James Smith Bush II (brother of Prescott Bush), who turned Astor down with startling candor, saying, \"I don't even like you.\" Astor proceeded to tell her that he was not well and, though only in his early 60s, he could not be expected to live for very long, whereupon she would inherit his millions. At that, Janet Bush reportedly replied, \"What if you do live?\" Mary Cushing then proposed Brooke. Together, Vincent and Brooke developed the Vincent Astor Foundation, a foundation that was designed to give back to New York City. Brooke died in 2007 at the age of 105.\n\nAstor joined the Naval Reserve shortly after it was founded and was commissioned as an ensign on December 28, 1915. He was called to active duty as part of the New York Naval Militia in February 1917 by order of Governor Charles S. Whitman to help guard bridges and aqueducts against possible German sabotage. Astor was assigned to help guard the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges.\n\nFollowing the declaration of war against Germany, Astor took advice from his friend and future president Franklin Delano Roosevelt and volunteered for active duty with the Navy on April 7, 1917. He went overseas on June 9 on the USS \"Noma\" (Astor's own yacht which had been acquired as a patrol ship by the Navy). He was later assigned to the armed yacht USS \"Aphrodite\".\n\nHe was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on January 1, 1918, and to lieutenant on July 1, 1918. He was joined in France by his wife, who did charity work with the YMCA at the naval base in Bordeaux, while he served as Port Officer at Royan.\n\nHis last assignment was as an officer on the captured German minelaying submarine \"U-117\" during her voyage to the United States. Astor returned to the United States on the \"U-117\" on April 25, 1919, and was discharged on May 24.\n\nAfter the war, Astor became a companion of the Naval Order of the United States.\n\nIn the quiet before the war, Astor sailed the \"Nourmahal\" in 1938 to Japan on a secret civilian mission for President Franklin D. Roosevelt to gather intelligence on the Japanese naval operations around the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. As he had done with the \"Noma\" in the First World War, he lent his yacht \"Nourmahal\" to the Coast Guard for service in the Second World War.\n\nIn World War II, Astor again served on active duty with the Navy. He was called to active duty with the rank of commander and given assignment as Area Controller for New York. In this position he coordinated merchant convoys leaving the city and provided informal intelligence work for President Roosevelt.\n\nPerhaps Astor's longer lasting contributions were his weekly reports from the Chase Bank where his inside access included USSR account balances. On 13 Dec 1940, Astor began reporting to the US Treasury the Soviet weekly balances in an unbroken sequence (made by occasional substitutes) up through at least 1945.\n\nDuring the early months of 1942, Astor suggested equipping fishing boats with radios so they could report U-boat sightings. One boat so equipped was Ernest Hemingway's fishing yacht \"Pilar\".\n\nIn June 1943, he was promoted to the rank of captain (with date of rank June 18, 1942).\n\nFor his service in the Navy, Captain Astor was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal, Naval Reserve Medal with star, World War I Victory Medal, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, and World War II Victory Medal.\n\nVincent Astor died on February 3, 1959, of a heart attack at his apartment at 120 East End Avenue in Manhattan. He left all of his money to the Vincent Astor foundation, with Brooke surprising many. She continued his philanthropic work.\n\nAstor was first interred on his \"Ferncliff Courts\" estate \"(\"Astor Courts\")\" on the Hudson River near Rhinebeck, New York. When Brooke later disposed of the property he was reinterred in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Brooke is buried next to him.\n\nHis half-brother Jakey felt cheated and resentfully stated that Vincent \"had the legal, not the moral right to keep all the money\". Jakey sued Brooke to inherit his money. He was certain that Vincent was \"mentally incompetent\" when signing his last will in June 1958 due to frequent smoking and alcoholism, though Brooke insisted otherwise. While Vincent was hospitalized, Brooke often brought him liquor. Jakey accused her of using the liquor to influence the will in her favor. Jakey ended up settling for $250,000. The rest of the money remained with the Vincent Astor foundation and Brooke.\n\nA mountain in Antarctica bears Astor's name.
