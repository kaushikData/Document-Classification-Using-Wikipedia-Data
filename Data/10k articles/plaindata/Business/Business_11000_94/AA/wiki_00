It helps dictate when tax is paid on income and gains. An accounting period begins whenever a company comes within the corporation tax charge, and whenever an accounting period ends without the company ceasing to be within the charge.\nThere are a number of rules about when an accounting period ends, and we look at each of these below. \n\nOften an accounting period coincides with a company's \"period of account\". This is the period for which it draws up accounts, except for a life assurance company, where it is the period for which it draws up its periodical return. However, periods of account and accounting periods do not necessarily coincide.\n\nAn accounting period begins when:\n\n\nAn accounting period ends on the earliest of the following:\n\n\nThere are further rules to deal with windings up, life assurance companies and lessor companies.\n\nA UK-resident company is treated as coming within the charge to corporation tax (if it has not already come within the charge to corporation tax) when it commences to carry on business.\n\nSuppose ABC Ltd, a UK resident company is incorporated on 1 August 20X1. It acquires a source of income (an interest-bearing bank account) on 1 September 20X1 and commences trading on 1 October 20X1 and continues trading throughout all other periods under review. It draws up its accounts for the following periods:\n\nThen ABC Ltd would have the following accounting periods:\n\nIf a company carrying on more than one trade draws up accounts of any of them to different dates, and does not make up general accounts for the whole of the company's activities, the company may determine that any one of those dates shall be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining whether an accounting period has ended under the rule in the second bullet point above.\n\nIf, however, the Board of HMRC is of the opinion, on reasonable grounds, that the date so chosen by the company is inappropriate, they may, if it is reasonable to do so, give notice that the accounting date of another of the company's trades should be used instead.\n\nSome companies draw up financial statements to the same day of the week, a Sunday, say, each year. They will therefore have 364-day (52-week) or 371-day (53-week) periods of account. As long as the company draws its accounts up to within four days of a mean accounting date each year, it may, for the purposes of determining its accounting periods, deem its accounts to be drawn up for a twelve-month period. For example, when there is a 371-day period of account, instead of having one accounting period of 365 days (in a non-leap year) and another of 6 days, it will prepare its return on the assumption that the period of account was 365 days long.\n\nThis method is related to the 4-4-5 Calendar of accounts, where a quarter is deemed to comprise two months of 4 weeks each and one month of 5 weeks, a total of 13 weeks or 91 days. In the United States the method is referred to as the 52-53 Week Fiscal Year and is approved for use under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the Internal Revenue Code. See article under 4-4-5 Calendar for discussion of the US method application.\n\nWhere it appears to the tax inspector that the beginning or end of any accounting period is uncertain, he may make an assessment on the company for such period, not exceeding 12 months, as appears to him appropriate. In that event, that period is treated for all purposes as an accounting period unless the inspector sees fit to revise it as a result of receiving further facts, or on an appeal against the assessment in respect of some other matter the company shows the true accounting periods. If on an appeal against an assessment made under this rule the company shows the true accounting periods, the assessment appealed against has effect as an assessment or assessments for the true accounting periods, and assessments may be made for any such periods as might have been made at the time when the assessment appealed against was made.\n\nAn accounting period ends immediately before the day a company enters into administration. For this purpose a company enters administration when it enters administration under Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 or is subject to any corresponding procedure otherwise than under that Act (for example, in an overseas jurisdiction). \n\nAn accounting period ends when a company ceases to be in administration. For these purposes a company ceases to be in administration when it ceases to be in administration under Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 or any corresponding event occurs otherwise than under that Act (for example, in an overseas jurisdiction).\n\nAn accounting period ends and a new one begins with the commencement of a winding up. For this purpose a winding up is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the winding up of the company, or on the presentation of a winding up petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a winding up order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose in the case of a winding up otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.\n\nAfter this, an accounting period does not end other than by the expiration of 12 months from its beginning or by the completion of the winding up. However, if the company later enters administration, this rule is disapplied from that point (and with an accounting period ending because the company has entered into administration).\n\nDuring the course of a winding up, a company may make an estimate of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. If the date assumed for the winding up turns out to be before the actual winding up, then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for the winding up, a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as if the winding up had started with that accounting period.\n\nHMRC will, under certain conditions, allow cooperatives that prepare quarterly and half-yearly accounts to merge a number of periods of account for tax purposes so that they have only accounting date each year.\n\nAdditionally, there are special rules that apply to life assurance companies from which life assurance business is transferred under an insurance business transfer scheme. Different rules apply depending on whether section 444AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 applies. For transfers before 1 January 2007, s444AA applies where the whole of the transferor's long-term insurance business is being transferred and the company. It is proposed that the Finance Bill 2007 will amend this for transfers on or after 1 January, so that section 444AA applies where the whole or substantially the whole of the transferor's long-term insurance business is transferred, in which case the transfer time is taken to be the time some business is first transferred/\n\nIf section 444AA does not apply, an accounting period of the transferor company ends with the day of the transfer.\n\nIf section 444AA applies, an accounting period of the transferor company ends immediately before the transfer, and the transferor also has an accounting period covering the instant of the transfer (except for the purposes of calculating the equalisation provision for tax purposes).\n\nSuppose a transferor company, XYZ Life Ltd, has in the past prepared periodical returns for a period encompassing the calendar year. It transfers the whole of its business at 11.59pm on 31 December 20X1, after which it retains some cash on deposit. It agrees with the Financial Services Authority that it does not need to prepare a periodical return for 20X1.\n\nXYZ Life Ltd will have the following accounting periods in 20X1:\n\nIf a company carries on a business of leasing plant or machinery, is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the business and there is a qualifying change of ownership in relation to the company, then an accounting period of the company ends on the day of that qualifying change in ownership, and a new accounting period begins on the following day. There are exceptions to this in Paragraph 40.\n\nOther provisions in the Taxes Acts sometimes deem there to be accounting periods for specific purposes only. This is typically on the introduction of new legislation. For example, when section 75 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 was replaced as a result of the Finance Act 2004, companies, if necessary, deemed themselves to have an accounting period ending on 31 March 2004 for the purposes of calculating management expenses that they were entitled to under the rules applying pre-1 April 2004 and post-31 March 2004.\n\n"}

Despite having lived in Australia since the 1960s, he is not a citizen of the country. This caused visa problems when he tried to return to Australia after having gone to Japan with his son Adam (also a boxer) for a boxing match in 2007. The New South Wales Police Force tried to bar Vella from re-entering Australia then, but he was eventually allowed to return. In 2014 Vella visited his friends in family in Malta, and while he was there, his residency visa was cancelled by the Australian Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Vella tried to appeal in the High Court in October 2015, but was not permitted to.\n\nVella was born into a strict Catholic family in Malta and was one of eleven children. His parents lived in a small villa near Buskett. He began work at the age of eight, carrying buckets of water on a building site for 30 cents a day, and is functionally illiterate. He and his family then moved to Australia in the 1960s and established a strawberry farm near Horsley Park, New South Wales. In his 20s, he sometimes worked two or three jobs at a time; as a bouncer, labourer and bricklayer. He also joined the Rebels Motorcycle Club while pursuing a promising career as a boxer; he eventually became the Maltese light-heavyweight champion. After a serious road accident, he received in compensation and used this money to set up a business importing and selling motorcycles.\n\nIn 1990, police found a $15,000 stash of marijuana while searching his home, which they believed to be a methamphetamine factory. He received a fairly light sentence: 18-months of two-nights-a-week prison, and two-days-a-week community service. He has also been arrested, but not convicted, of a number of other crimes including stabbing two men and assaulting a woman. He was freed on appeal after being given six months in jail for the latter.\n\nOn 28 May 2008, Vella won a court case against the ANZ Bank. He sued them for $2.7 million after his former business partner, Tony Caradonna, re-mortgaged three properties, including the Rebels' clubhouse, for $2.4 million by falsifying Vella's signature. He also claimed $300,000 was fraudulently withdrawn from their joint bank account.\n\nOn 16 June 2014, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison cancelled Vella's residency visa on character grounds while Vella was visiting Malta. Vella attempted to challenge the action in the High Court of Australia, but on 16 October 2015 the court refused his application for leave to appeal.\n"}

The Japanese variety of bread crumbs is called \"panko\".\n\nDry breadcrumbs are made from dry breads which have been baked or toasted to remove most remaining moisture, and may have a sandy or even powdery texture. Bread crumbs are most easily produced by pulverizing slices of bread in a food processor, using a steel blade to make coarse crumbs, or a grating blade to make fine crumbs. A grater or similar tool will also do.\n\nThe breads used to make soft or fresh bread crumbs are not quite as dry, so the crumbs are larger and produce a softer coating, crust, or stuffing. The \"crumb\" of \"bread crumb\" also refers to the texture of the soft, inner part of a bread loaf, as distinguished from the crust, or \"skin\".\n\n is a variety of flaky bread crumb used in Japanese cuisine as a crunchy coating for fried foods, such as \"tonkatsu\". \"Panko\" is made from bread baked by electrical current, which yields a bread without a crust, and then grinding the bread to create fine slivers of crumb. It has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in Western cuisine and resists absorbing oil or grease when fried, resulting in a lighter coating. Outside Japan, its use is becoming more popular in both Asian and non-Asian dishes: It is often used on seafood and is often available in Asian markets, speciality stores, and, increasingly, in many large supermarkets.\n\n\"Panko\" is produced worldwide, particularly in Asian countries, including Japan, Korea, Thailand, China, and Vietnam.\n\nThe Japanese first learned to make bread from the Europeans. The word \"panko\" is derived from \"pan\", the Portuguese/Spanish/Japanese word for bread, and \"-ko\", a Japanese suffix indicating \"flour\", \"coating\", \"crumb\", or \"powder\" (as in \"komeko\", \"rice powder\", \"sobako\", \"buckwheat flour\", and \"komugiko\", \"wheat flour\").\n\nBreading (also known as crumbing) is a dry grain-derived food coating for a piece of food made from bread crumbs or a breading mixture with seasonings. Breading can also refer to the process of applying a bread-like coating to a food. Breading is well suited for frying as it lends itself to creating a crisp coating around the food. Breading mixtures can be made of breadcrumb, flour, cornmeal, and seasoning that the item to be breaded is dredged in before cooking. If the item to be breaded is too dry for the coating to stick, the item may first be moistened with buttermilk, raw egg, egg wash or other liquid.\n\nBreading contrasts with batter, which is a grain-based liquid coating for food that produces a smoother and finer texture, but which can be softer overall.\n\nIn the fairy tale Hansel and Gretel, breadcrumbs were used by Hansel and Gretel to track their footpath. However, the bread crumbs were eventually eaten by birds, subsequently leading them to become lost in the woods. The popularity of breadcrumbs in the fairy tale lead to the inspiration the name \"breadcrumb\" as a navigation element that allows users to keep track of their locations within programs or documents.\n\nFried Shrimp, Fried Chicken Fillet, Fried Fish, Fried Mushroom... List of recipes with Panko in countless and its range is your imagination.Some recipes with Panko Tempura Powder are: Nanban Chicken (Tempura + Chicken Fillet), Puff Onion (Tempura + Onion), Puff Shrimp (Tempura + Shrimp)\n"}

He served in the U.S. Congress from 1937 to 1940 as a Republican from New York.\n\nBorn in Robbins, Tennessee in 1886, Barton was the son of a Congregational clergyman and grew up in various places throughout the U.S., including the metro Chicago area. Barton was raised in Oak Park, Illinois (located only ten miles away by railroads from Chicago).\n\nBruce Barton's father, William E. Barton, was a prolific writer and a devout Christian pastor serving the First Congregational Church for over 20 years. Barton's mother, Esther Treat Bushnell, was an elementary school teacher who was descended from a number of colonial Connecticut leaders including Francis Bushnell, Robert Treat, and John Davenport. Barton's siblings were Charles William Barton (b. 1887), Helen (b. 1889), Robert Shawmut Barton (b. 1894). Barton's parents also took in a young abandoned mulatto boy to care for in the Barton household by the name of Webster Betty, as they also did for Rebecca, a young African-American girl whose mother asked Barton's parents to take care of her.\n\nJournalism appealed to Barton even as a child and he sold newspapers in his free time when he was only nine. Later on during his teenage years, he served as the editor for his high school newspaper, and became a reporter for a local newspaper called the Oak Park Weekly. Barton also helped run his uncle's maple syrup business, which became successful due to his contributions.\n\nBarton first enrolled in Berea College (where his father attended college) during 1903 and later transferred to Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he graduated in 1907.\n\nBarton worked as a publicist and magazine editor before co-founding the Barton, Durstine & Osborn (BDO) advertising agency in 1919. Nine years later the agency merged with the George Batten agency to become Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn (BBDO). Barton replaced Roy S. Durstein as president of BBDO during 1939 and then headed the BBDO agency until 1961, all while helping his business partners and employees toward establishing Madison Avenue in New York City as the Mecca for the advertising industry, advancing institutional advertising for American corporations, and developing BBDO into one of the major creative advertising firms operating in the United States.\n\nAmong other famous BBDO campaigns, Barton created the character of Betty Crocker. He is also credited with naming General Motors and General Electric (and creating an early design of the circular GE corporate logo and catch phrase). Barton was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1940 to 1942.\n\nInitially supporting progressive political policies as a young man, Barton later became an active supporter of the Republican Party in 1919, and he later served as an advisor for both the Republican Party and several Republican presidential candidates from the time of Calvin Coolidge during the 1920s to that of Dwight Eisenhower during the 1950s. As a staunch opponent of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, Barton offered his public relations services to many Republican candidates over the years. Barton won a special election to fill the unexpired term of Democrat U.S. Rep. Theodore A. Peyser, who died on August 8, 1937, within the U.S. House of Representatives. Barton eventually served two terms (1937–1941) within the U.S. House, representing the Manhattan house district and he later ran an unsuccessful 1940 campaign for election as U.S. Senator from New York.\n\nAs the author of many bestselling guidebooks, Barton also wrote literally hundreds of popular magazines articles and syndicated newspaper columns, offering his readers advice and inspiration for attaining Barton's own idealization of the American Dream, based largely upon Barton's meshing of his own life as a \"small town boy\" and sectarian Christian beliefs in with his admiration of certain American business and industry leaders (\"Service\").\n\nBarton had projected many Christian Biblical themes throughout his works completed within his varied writing career, due in part to his own strong religious convictions. One historian writes: \"Barton believed incurably in material progress, in self-improvement, in individualism, and in the Judeo-Christian ethic, and none of the profound crises through which his generation lived appreciably changed the tenor of his writings or their capacity to reflect what masses of Americans, optimists in the progressive tradition, apparently continued to want to hear.\"\n\nBarton's most famous book was, \"The Man Nobody Knows\" (1925), a \"boosterish melding of religion with business\" that coupled with \"new communication and advertising media\", provided the \"cultural shift that encouraged the public display of spiritual allegiances that once belonged to the realm of private life\", while amplifying the widely perceived public adoration of American business during the 1920s. In this book, Barton envisions Jesus as if he were alive as a man's man in the present day of the 1920s while criticizing the overly meek Jesus that people were used to during that time. Barton also depicts Jesus as a \"strong magnetic\" executive businessman, similar to himself.\n\nIn the 1925 edition of \"The Man Nobody Knows\" Barton incorporated controversial chapter titles leading into the exploration of Barton's Jesus-as-businessman themes, such as calling Jesus a modern \"Executive\", postulating that Jesus communicated effectively by \"His Advertisements\", and hailing Jesus as \"The Founder of Modern Business\" among others. In the much later 1956 edition of \"The Man Nobody Knows\", editors at Bobbs-Merrill \"heavily amended\" Barton's text with his permission, cutting out the references to business and advertising. along with excerpts featuring popular celebrities of the 1920s, such as Henry Ford, George Perkins, and Jim Jeffries.\n\nIn his later 1926 book, \"The Book Nobody Knows\", Barton provides readers with his revamped image of the Christian Holy Bible.\n\nPublic attention was called to a sexual affair that Barton was secretly having from 1928 to 1932 with BBDO employee Frances Wagner King. King had originally presented herself to Barton and others at BBDO as an unmarried woman. Her husband later threatened to sue Barton for alienation of affection. Barton paid the Kings $25,000 in hush money.\n\nLater, during a 1932 appointment with her attorney, Mrs. King informed Barton that she was suing him for slander and seeking damages of $250,000 based on an unfavorable work reference he had provided to a potential employer of King.\n\nMrs. King also informed Barton she was working on a novel about an advertising man based loosely on Barton's own private and public life, but that she would not publish her work and would drop her slander lawsuit if Barton would settle the matter with a payment of $50,000 to King.\n\nThe newspapers reported about the Barton and King sexual affair (and other similar King allegations of impropriety by Barton) after learning of Barton's arrest under a civil order from Mrs. King's slander suit.\n\nBarton filed a blackmail criminal charge against Mrs. King on April 17, 1933, and her criminal trial ran from July 18 to August 2, 1933. On August 2, 1933, a jury found Frances Wagner King guilty of blackmail. After her serving two years of her original sentence, an appeal court reduced Mrs. King's sentence to three to six years.\n\nThe attorney handling Mrs. King's slander suit against Barton had paid to typeset King's novel, arranged to have Barton arrested, and offered to rescind the slander lawsuit against Barton upon a settlement paid to King. King's attorney was later disbarred in 1936.\n\nBruce Barton died at his home at 117 East 55th Street in New York City in 1967.\n\nIn 1925, Barton wrote a letter to 24 rich men who all replied with at least $1,000.\n\n"}

He has faced charges of match fixing in Italy since 2011 and Hungary since 2013 as part of the \"Calcio scommesse\" scandal. Despite Interpol considering him the \"boss\" of the \"world's largest and most aggressive match-fixing syndicate\", he was not arrested in Singapore until late 2013 since it lacks an extradition treaty with the European Union.\n\nTan was born on 29 April 1964, and did not graduate from secondary school. In the early 1990s, he spent less than a year in jail for illegal horse-racing and football bookmaking and, in 1994, fled Singapore after losing US$1.5 million on that year's World Cup. He returned after he was allowed to pay off his debts in instalments.\n\nBy early 2013, he was a salaried employee, an investor, and a high-stakes gambler. He has a young son and his current wife, the Chinese national Guan Enmei, is thought to be his third. They live modestly and \"The Straits Times\" has reported that his friends call him \"Ah Blur\" from his obliviousness. They describe him as \"very jovial and happy-go-lucky\" and say he only occasionally watches football, spending most free time watching the stock market.\n\nIn 2012, Tan and his family disconnected their phones and left their former gated apartment building for an anonymous replacement after its location was published by \"Stern\" and Singaporean newspapers. In March 2013, a \"Madam Lim\" claimed to be Tan's second wife and complained to Singapore's \"New Paper\" that he abandoned her and their two sons ten years before.\n\nDan Tan served less than a year in jail in the early 1990s for illegal horse-racing and football bookmaking. He has admitted to having served as the director of the Singaporean company Exclusive Sports PTE Ltd, a rebranding of Football4U, which was founded by convicted match-fixer Wilson Raj Perumal. Both companies arranged exhibition games and provided referees which have since come under suspicion for match fixing. Tan's involvement with the company, however, was short-lived, lasting only from November 2010 to February 2011. He later professed he withdrew his investments upon discovering their dodgy practices. The span of his involvement parallels the company's failed attempt to buy the right to showcase its players with the Finnish club Tampere United for €300,000. Tampere's club has been indefinitely suspended since 11 April 2011 for its involvement.)\n\nIn November 2010, the 3rd-division Cremonese were drugged by their goalkeeper Marco Paoloni in a failed attempt to throw the match to the underdog Paganese. Investigation of Paolini's contacts revealed a match-fixing syndicate known as the \"Zingari\" (\"Gypsies\") with ties to organised crime in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Italian authorities, led by the Cremonese prosecutor Roberto di Martino, subsequently established coördination and funding from a Singaporean cartel, which made millions of euros from fixing matches in the Italian Serie A and Serie B leagues. Di Martino claims evidence tying Tan directly to payoffs and illegal bets, giving him a \"central role\" in the scandal; he is known to have been in Italy in 2009 in the company of three \"Zingari\" and Choo Beng Huat, a money runner. An arrest warrant was issued by Italy in late December 2011. The lack of an extradition treaty, however, meant that Tan could only be arrested in Singapore upon local charges.\n\nIn February 2011, Wilson Raj Perumalthe man credited with the fake Togolese team who played Bahrain in 2010was arrested in Finland and began speaking with authorities, reducing his two-year sentence to less than a year. Perumal had been given US$500,000 (€385,000) to purchase the Rovaniemen Palloseura outright from its Finnish owners but pocketed $300,000 for himself to pay his own gambling debts. He has since argued that he was merely \"rais[ing] quotation prices\" for his services after seeing Ibrahim Chaibou, a referee in his employ, working at an Bolivia–Venezuela exhibition game in October 2010. He had been in business with Tan for three years but considered this to be a betrayal, since his subordinate Anthony Santia Raj.\n\nThe lack of funds, however, scuttled the deal and, shortly afterwards, his associate Joseph Tan Xie entered the Rovaniemi central police station and announced that Perumal was in Finland on a forged passport under the name Rajamorgan Chelliah. Following a two-hour interview with Joseph, the police's further investigation showed Perumal berating Palloseura players in a café after they played to a draw instead of a loss. Finnish National Bureau of Investigation detained and then arrested him over the passport on a domestic flight to Helsinki. (Perumal was a fugitive from Singapore, having fled a 5-year sentence in July 2010 after running over a policeman with his car; he had also been under investigation by FIFA's head of security Chris Eaton for the prior six months.) Perumal's arrest scuttled the deal between Exclusive Sports and Tampere United; it led to a June 2011 police raid on the TamU offices and the April 2013, conviction of the club's CEO and chairman for related money laundering.\n\nIn revenge for his own arrest, Perumal then fingered Tan as placing bets for the syndicate using Asian-based online gambling sites and intermediaries in China. The operation typically placed a large number of low-level bets, sets of around €100 (US$130) each using different credit cards. Money was also moved and laundered using Islamic \"hawala\" financing networks. A standard fee for the European match fixers was €200,000 ($260k). Perumal's allegations against Tan were first made public in a 28 July 2011, article in the German magazine \"Stern\".\n\nIn February 2013, Europol claimed the involvement of \"networks based in the city state of Singapore\" in \"at least\" 380 local, national, and international matches within Europe and another 300 elsewhere. The games included World Cup qualifiers and the European Champions league and netted an estimated $10.81 million. The Singapore Police Force finally began speaking to half a dozen local witnesses. A few days after the SPF interviewed him, the former Slovenian player Admir Suljic voluntarily boarded a plane to Italy where he was immediately arrested by Milanese police. The SPF reported that Tan was coöperating with their investigations and also dispatched four SPF and CPIB detectives to Interpol's headquarters in Lyons, France. They met with the Global Anti-Match-fixing Taskforce and examined files from Italy, Hungary, Germany, and Finland in the hope of receiving evidence that a crime had been committed in Singapore. Despite public complaints, Europe proved slow to move the investigation forward, taking more than a year to forward requested documents and leaving key witnesses inaccessible.\n\nIn March, Tan spoke with the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" via online chat. Regarding match fixing, he opined that \"one has to proceed against these criminals\". He claimed never to have personally bribed a player but admitted providing \"contributions\" of up to €800,000 ($1.05m) and to losing $3 million in a failed attempt to fix a September 2001, match in Istanbul between Barcelona and Fenerbahçe. He had bet that there would be three or fewer goals during the match; when Barcelona took an early lead, his paid employees on the field sabotaged the stadium's lights to force a cancellation. Instead, backup generators were quickly able to restore power. He claimed the most he had ever won was €15 million ($19.5m) for an Italian Serie A game.\n\nOn 23 May, Hungarian prosecutors indicted Tan \"in absentia\" among 44 others following a four-year investigation of match fixing. The indictment specified the rigging of 32 games in Hungary, Italy, and Finland. Tan was the only foreigner indicted; the other 44 were all Hungarian players, coaches, managers, owners, or referees. Perumal was extradicted from Finland to Hungary as part of the investigation; he was placed under house arrest or preventive detention while outlining the networks as he understood them.\n\nActing on new testimony provided by two members of the syndicate, Tan was arrested amid a 12-hour series of raids carried out on 16 and 17 September 2013, by the Criminal Investigation Department, Police Intelligence Department, and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. He has been kept in custody since. The briefing by the SPF and CPIB and press release from Interpol did not officially name any of the twelve men or two women arrested under the Prevention of Corruption Act and involvement in \"organised crime activities\", but mentioned an unspecified \"ringleader\" who was refused bail. The Associated Press has reported \"high-level\" confirmation that Tan was that person; \"The Straits Times\" and \"New Paper\" have also confirmed Tan's detainment. Of the other 13 people detained, nine have been released on bail. Tan's current wife is believed to have been among them. Three others remain in custody with Tan and one has been issued police supervision in lieu of incarceration.\n\nHowever, ESPN has reported that the Singaporean network simply provided men with fluent English and liberal passport access to triad gangs based in mainland China; the Singaporean sports reporter Suresh Nair has also said that Tan was not a major part of the operation but only a middleman for behind-the-scenes bosses. In 2012, FIFA's head of security Ralf Mutschke downplayed Tan's importance, saying he had only \"symbolic importance\" and was probably not \"as involved as everyone is thinking\". Much of the evidence tying Tan to criminal activity derives from Wilson Raj's confessions to police in Finland and Hungary, and Chris Eaton has stated that Raj is \"used to giving unreliable information to authorities\". Acquaintances speaking to \"The Straits Times\" admit he may have purchased information on fixed games from Perumal but argue that his withdrawal of funds from Exclusive Sports accounts for his \"grudge\".\n\nThe BBC reports that a \"source close to the investigation\" admits that there is not currently enough evidence to try Tan in Singapore, particularly since the two members of the syndicate whose testimony was responsible for his arrest refuse to testify in open court. No other jurisdiction with an outstanding warrant for his arrest has extradition agreements with the country. However, it remains possible that he could be held indefinitely: §44 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act permits a suspect to be held 16 days from the time of his arrest and §241 of the 1955 Prevention of Corruption Act permits him to be held up to a year without trial. Such a decision will be considered by the Ministry of Home Affairs and an advisory council before being personally made by President Halimah Yacob. Further, Singapore still does not formally acknowledge his detention and the year-long pretrial term can be extended by the authorities.\n\n"}

The law of diminishing returns does not imply that adding more of a factor will decrease the \"total\" production, a condition known as negative returns, though in fact this is common.\n\nA common example is adding more people to a job, such as the assembly of a car on a factory floor. At some point, adding more workers causes problems such as workers getting in each other's way or frequently finding themselves waiting for access to a part. In all of these processes, producing one more unit of output per unit of time will eventually require increasingly more usage of the input, due to the input being used less effectively. Another well-studied example is throwing more headcount at software development, yielding Brooks's law. \n\nThe law of diminishing returns is a fundamental principle of economics. It plays a central role in production theory.\n\nThe concept of diminishing returns can be traced back to the concerns of early economists such as Johann Heinrich von Thünen, Jacques Turgot, Adam Smith, James Steuart, Thomas Robert Malthus, and David Ricardo. However, classical economists such as Malthus and Ricardo attributed the successive diminishment of output to the decreasing quality of the inputs. Neoclassical economists assume that each \"unit\" of labor is identical. Diminishing returns are due to the disruption of the entire productive process as additional units of labor are added to a fixed amount of capital. The law of diminishing returns remains an important consideration in farming.\n\nAn example is a factory that has a fixed stock of capital, or tools and machines, and a variable supply of labor. As the firm increases the number of workers, the total output of the firm grows but at an ever-decreasing rate. This is because after a certain point, the factory becomes overcrowded and workers begin to form lines to use the machines. The long-run solution to this problem is to increase the stock of capital, that is, to buy more machines and to build more factories.\n\nThere is an inverse relationship between returns of inputs and the cost of production. Suppose that a kilogram of seed costs one dollar, and this price does not change. Although there are other costs, assume they do not vary with the amount of output and are therefore fixed costs. One kilogram of seeds yields one ton of crop, so the first ton of the crop costs one dollar to produce. That is, for the first ton of output, the marginal cost of the output is $1 per ton. If there are no other changes, then if the second kilogram of seeds applied to land produces only half the output of the first, the marginal cost would equal $1 per half ton of output, or $2 per ton. Similarly, if the third kilogram of seeds yields only a quarter ton, then the marginal cost equals $1 per quarter ton or $4 per ton. Thus, diminishing marginal returns imply increasing marginal costs and rising average costs.\n\nCost can also be measured in terms of opportunity cost. In this case the law also applies to societies – the opportunity cost of producing a single unit of a good generally increases as a society attempts to produce more of that good. This explains the bowed-out shape of the production possibilities frontier.\n\n"}

By the following spring, his mother Elizabeth Clementine Stedman moved the boy and his younger brother to Plainfield, New Jersey to live with her wealthy father, David Low Dodge. Dodge, a Calvinist and pacifist, was strict, did not want to use his finances to support his grandchildren, and often physically punished the boys for bad behavior. Mrs. Stedman sold poems and stories to magazines including \"Graham's Magazine\", \"Sartain's Magazine\", \"The Knickerbocker\", and \"Godey's Lady's Book\" for income. Eventually, the children were taken in by their paternal grandfather, Griffin Stedman, and his brother James in Norwich, Connecticut.\n\nStedman studied two years at Yale University; became a journalist in New York City, especially on the staffs of the \"Tribune\" and \"World\", for which latter paper he served as field correspondent during the first years of the Civil War. As opportunity offered, he studied law and was for a time private secretary to Attorney-General Bates at Washington, and was a member of the New York Stock Exchange in Wall Street from 1865 to 1900. His first book, \"Poems, Lyrical and Idyllic\", appeared in 1860, followed by successive volumes of similar character, and by collected editions of his verse in 1873, 1884 and 1897. His longer poems are \"Alice of Monmouth: an Idyl of the Great War\" (1864); \"The Blameless Prince\" (1869), an allegory of good deeds, supposed to have been remotely suggested by the life of Prince Albert; and an elaborate commemorative ode on Nathaniel Hawthorne, read before the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1877.\n\nAn idyllic atmosphere is the prevalent characteristic of his longer pieces, while the lyric tone is never absent from his songs, ballads and poems of reflection or fancy. As an editor he put forth a volume of \"Cameos\" from Walter Savage Landor (with Thomas Bailey Aldrich, 1874); a large Library of (selections from) American Literature (with Ellen M Hutchinson, 11 vols, 1888–1890); a \"Victorian Anthology\" (1895); and an \"American Anthology, 1787-1899\" (1900); the two last-named volumes being ancillary to a detailed and comprehensive critical study in prose of the whole body of English poetry from 1837, and of American poetry of the 19th century.\n\nThis study appeared in separate chapters in \"Scribner's Monthly\" (which closed in 1881 and was relaunched the same year as the \"Century Magazine\"), and was reissued, with enlargements, in the volumes entitled \"Victorian Poets\" (1875; continued to the Jubilee year in the edition of 1887) and \"Poets of America\" (1885), the two works forming the most symmetrical body of literary criticism yet published in the United States. Their value is increased by the treatise on \"The Nature and Elements of Poetry\" (Boston, 1892) a work of great critical insight as well as technical knowledge.\n\nStedman edited, with Ellen M. Hutchinson, \"A Library of American Literature\" (eleven volumes, 1888–90); and, with George E. Woodberry, the \"Works of Edgar Allan Poe\" (ten volumes, 1895). After the death of James Russell Lowell, Stedman had perhaps the leading place among American poets and critics. In 1876, he was one of several poets who were gently mocked by Bayard Taylor in his verse parody \"The Echo Club and Other Literary Diversions\".\n\nIn 1904, Edmund Clarence Stedman was one of the first seven chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\n\nIn addition to his literary achievements, Stedman pursued scientific and technical endeavors. In 1879, he proposed a rigid airship inspired by the anatomy of a fish, with a framework of steel, brass, or copper tubing and a tractor propeller mounted on the crafts bow, later changed to an engine with two propellers suspended beneath the framework. The airship never was built, but its design foreshadowed that of the dirigibles of the early decades of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n"}

As of March 2013, he is the second richest person in Argentina.\n\nEduardo Eurnekian was born to Armenian immigrant parents on 4 December 1932. His family established a textile manufacturer which prospered with the Argentine economy and became an important supplier to international sporting apparel firm Puma; but which, like many Argentine textile makers, nearly collapsed after Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz's round of free trade and deregulatory policies led to a severe crisis, in 1981.\n\nThe Eurnekian family reportedly borrowed heavily from the former Argentine small business lender, BANADE, and in 1988, Eduardo Eurnekian purchased \"Cablevisión S.A,\" then a failing local cable tv station. His investment became increasingly lucrative following Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's implementation of the Convertibility Plan in 1991, which brought financial and price stability to Argentina during the 1990s. Eurnekian in 1994 sold a 51% stake in Cablevision S.A. (by then Argentina's second-largest cable operator), to Tele-Communications Inc. for US$350 million and in 1997, netted US$320 million by selling most of his remaining shares to local investment giant CEI Citicorp Holdings SA.\n\nEurnekian also held controlling interest in \"América TV\", four radio stations and a Buenos Aires financial daily, \"El Cronista\". \"Aeropuertos Argentina 2000,\" a consortium led by Eurnekian won a 30-year concession in 1998 to run 33 of the Argentina's main airports. He also bought the Howard Johnson's master franchise in Argentina from Cendant, and invested in a regional airline company, LAPA.\n\nOn 17 December 2001, Eurnekian's Corporación América signed a 30-year concession agreement with the Armenian government for the management of operations of Zvartnots International Airport, which is Armenia's largest airport. The company launched the construction of a new terminal which brought the airport into conformity with international standards. The total cost of the project was more than $50 million.\n\nEurnekian also unveiled plans to invest millions of dollars into Armenia's agribusiness sector as he set up a joint venture with a local firm. Senior executives from \"Tierras de Armenia\", a Yerevan-based company belonging to Eurnekian, and the Max Group (owned by Harutiun Pambukian, a parliamentarian close to former President Robert Kocharian), reported a US$25 million joint venture to develop 60 km (24 mi) of arid land in the southern Armavir region into fruit orchards and a fruit processing plant.\n\nEurnekian has built an almost $1 billion media empire since the early 1990s and is now the majority owner of a consortium operating 76 airports worldwide, mostly across Argentina and elsewhere in South America as well as in Armenia. He also owns 2,000 square kilometres of land and food processing factories in northern Argentina. He has been awarded as the \"Business Man of the year\" in 1995. In 1999 he received in Italy the \"Leonardo Award\", given to the foreign businessman of the year. He also received the highest awards in Armenia for his activities. In 2012 he was awarded the Business for Peace award in Oslo, Norway.\n\nEurnekian is single, and his \"chosen successor\" is his nephew Martin Eurnekian.\n\n"}

{"id": "15403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15403", "title": "ISO 4217", "text": "ISO 4217\n\nISO 4217 is a standard first published by International Organization for Standardization in 1978, which delineates currency designators, country codes (alpha and numeric), and references to minor units in three tables:\n\nThe tables, history and ongoing discussion are maintained by SIX Interbank Clearing on behalf of ISO and the Swiss Association for Standardization.\n\nThe ISO 4217 code list is used in banking and business globally. In many countries the ISO codes for the more common currencies are so well known publicly that exchange rates published in newspapers or posted in banks use only these to delineate the currencies, instead of translated currency names or ambiguous currency symbols. ISO 4217 codes are used on airline tickets and international train tickets to remove any ambiguity about the price.\n\nThe first two letters of the code are the two letters of the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes (which are also used as the basis for national top-level domains on the Internet) and the third is usually the initial of the currency itself. So Japan's currency code is JPY—JP for Japan and Y for yen. This eliminates the problem caused by the names \"dollar, franc, peso\" and \"pound\" being used in dozens of countries, each having significantly differing values. Also, if a currency is revalued, the currency code's last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency. In some cases, the third letter is the initial for \"new\" in that country's language, to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued; the code sometimes outlasts the usage of the term \"new\" itself (for example, the code for the Mexican peso is MXN). Other changes can be seen, however; the Russian ruble, for example, changed from RUR to RUB, where the B comes from the third letter in the word \"ruble\".\n\nIn addition to codes for most active national currencies ISO 4217 provides codes for \"supranational\" currencies, procedural purposes, and several things which are \"similar to\" currencies:\n\nThe use of an initial letter \"X\" for these purposes is facilitated by the ISO 3166 rule that no official country code beginning with X will ever be assigned. Because of this rule ISO 4217 can use X codes without risk of clashing with a future country code. ISO 3166 country codes beginning with \"X\" are used for private custom use (reserved), never for official codes. For instance, the ISO 3166-based NATO country codes (STANAG 1059, 9th edition) use \"X\" codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from XXB for \"Brownland\" to XXR for \"Redland\", as well as for major commands such as XXE for SHAPE or XXS for SACLANT. Consequently, ISO 4217 can use \"X\" codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future country codes.\n\nThe inclusion of EU (denoting the European Union) in the ISO 3166-1 reserved codes list, allows the euro to be coded as EUR rather than assigned a code beginning with X, even though it is a supranational currency.\n\nThe ISO 4217 standard includes a crude mechanism for expressing the relationship between a major currency unit and its corresponding minor currency unit. This mechanism is called the currency \"exponent\" and assumes a base of 10. For example, USD (the United States dollar) is equal to 100 of its minor currency unit the \"cent\". So the USD has exponent 2 (10 to the power 2 is 100, which is the number of cents in a dollar). The code JPY (Japanese yen) is given the exponent 0, because its minor unit, the sen, although nominally valued at 1/100 of a yen, is of such negligible value that it is no longer used. Usually, as with the USD, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but in some cases (including most varieties of the dinar) 1/1000 is used, and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10. Mauritania does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 ouguiya (UM) equal to 5 khoums, and Madagascar has 1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja. Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all and these are given an exponent of 0, as with currencies whose minor units are unused due to negligible value.\n\nThere is also a three-digit code number assigned to each currency, in the same manner as there is also a three-digit code number assigned to each country as part of ISO 3166. This numeric code is usually the same as the ISO 3166-1 numeric code. For example, USD (United States dollar) has code 840 which is also the numeric code for the US (United States).\n\nThe ISO standard does not regulate either the spacing, prefixing or suffixing in usage of currency codes. According however to the European Union's Publication Office, in English, Irish, Latvian and Maltese texts, the ISO 4217 code is to be followed by a hard space and the amount:\n\nIn Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish and Swedish the order is reversed; the amount is followed by a hard space and the ISO 4217 code:\n\nNote that, as illustrated, the order is determined not by the currency, but by the native language of the document context.\n\nIn 1973, the ISO Technical Committee 68 decided to develop codes for the representation of currencies and funds for use in any application of trade, commerce or banking. At the 17th session (February 1978), the related UN/ECE Group of Experts agreed that the three-letter alphabetic codes for International Standard ISO 4217, \"Codes for the representation of currencies and funds\", would be suitable for use in international trade.\n\nOver time, new currencies are created and old currencies are discontinued. Frequently, these changes are due to the formation of new governments, treaties between countries standardizing on a shared currency, or revaluation of an existing currency due to excessive inflation. As a result, the list of codes must be updated from time to time. The ISO 4217 maintenance agency (MA), SIX Interbank Clearing, is responsible for maintaining the list of codes.\n\nThe following is a list of active codes of official ISO 4217 currency names.\nIn the standard the values are called \"alphabetic code\", \"numeric code\", and \"minor unit\".\nThe US dollar has two codes assigned: USD and USN (next day). The USS (same day) code is not in use any longer, and was removed from the list of active ISO 4217 codes in March 2014.\n\nAccording to UN/CEFACT recommendation 9, paragraphs 8–9 ECE/TRADE/203, 1996, available online:\n\nAs of August 2018, there are no new codes planned to be added to the standard.\n\nA number of currencies are not included in ISO 4217, because these currencies are: (a) minor currencies pegged 1:1 to a larger currency, even if independently regulated (b) a legal tender only issued as commemorative banknotes or coinage, or (c) a currency of an unrecognized or partially recognized state. These currencies include:\n\nSee for a list of all currently pegged currencies.\n\nDespite having no official recognition in ISO 4217, the following non-ISO codes are sometimes used locally or commercially.\n\nIn addition, GBX is sometimes used (for example on the London Stock Exchange) to denote Penny sterling, a subdivision of pound sterling, the currency for the United Kingdom.\n\nRecently, cryptocurrencies have unofficially used ISO codes on various cryptocurrency exchanges, for instance LTC for Litecoin, NMC for Namecoin and XRP for Ripple. SIX Interbank Clearing (a Maintenance Agency of ISO) is currently studying the impact and role of cryptocurrencies and other independent currencies on ISO 4217.\n\nA number of currencies were official ISO 4217 currency codes and currency names until their replacement by the euro or other currencies. The table below shows the ISO currency codes of former currencies and their common names (which do not always match the ISO 4217 names). These codes were first introduced in december 1988 after a request from the reinsurance sector was accepted\n\n\n\n"}

Prominent actors or filmmakers may use their negotiating power to insist on such provisions.

At the age of 12, Ericsson's father died forcing him to seek work as a miner. He worked until he had money enough to leave the village and move to Stockholm in 1867. He then worked for six years for an instrument maker named \"Öllers & Co.\" who mainly created telegraph equipment. Because of his skills, he was given two state scholarships to study instrument making abroad between 1872 and 1875. One of the companies he worked at was Siemens & Halske.\n\nUpon his return to Sweden in 1876, he founded a small mechanical workshop together with his friend Carl Johan Andersson who had also worked at \"Öllers & Co.\". This workshop was actually a former kitchen of some 13 m situated at Drottninggatan 15 in the most central part of Stockholm. Here, he started a telephone company by analyzing Bell company and Siemens telephones and creating his own copies in their image. It was not until they started cooperating with Henrik Tore Cedergren in 1883 that the company would start to grow into the Ericsson corporation.\n\nIn the year 1900 Lars Magnus retired from Ericsson at the age of 54. He kept his shares in the company until 1905 and then sold them all.\n\nHe is said to have been a demanding person, and disliked any direct publicity about his personality and did not wish to be idolized. He was, however, deeply respected by his employees. He was always a skeptic and cautious in business. He was also somewhat opposed to patents, as many of the products he made would not have been possible to do if the patent legislation had been overly effective. When his phones were copied by Norwegian companies he did not care, as his phones had in turn been largely copied from Siemens. He initially did not believe in a mass market for telephones, and saw it as a toy for the leisure class.\n\nAfter his death in 1926, he was buried at Hågelby gård in Botkyrka. At his explicit request, there is no headstone marking his grave.\n"}

This conception is based on a business perspective, recognizing that there are threats entailed in the business operating environment. The idea is that businesses do not operate in a vacuum and that, in the exploitation of opportunities and their engagement with other businesses, their activities tend to become subjects of legal liabilities and obligations.\n\nOne of the primary reasons why legal risk is associated with operational risk involves fraud since it is recognized as the most significant category of operational loss events and considered to be a legal issue as well. These, however, do not mean that legal risk is only confined to this conceptualization because it is defined in more than way. For instance, there are specific sets of legal risks that are defined by the European Union (EU) Law. In 2005, the European Central Bank declared that it will develop its own legal risk definition to help \"facilitate proper risk assessment and risk management, as well as ensure a consistent approach between EU credit institutions.\"\n\nThere is no standard definition, but there are at least two primary/secondary definition sets in circulation.\n\nMcormick, R. 2004\nLegal risk is the risk of loss to an institution which is primarily caused by:<br>\n(a) a defective transaction; or<br>\n(b) a claim (including a defense to a claim or a counterclaim) being made or some other event occurring which results in a liability for the institution or other loss (for example, as a result of the termination of a contract) or;<br>\n(c) failing to take appropriate measures to protect assets (for example, intellectual property) owned by the institution; or<br>\n(d) change in law.\n\nMcormick, R. 2004\nManagement of legal risk is not a precise science and subjective to the situation of the institution, and primarily caused by the lack of proper communication channel, undefined institutional objectives (such as the lack of policies and regulations), unclarified information flow between different personnel and department, lack of delegation of power to specify task on mitigation of risks.\n\nThe expenses of litigation of a company.\n\nLegal risk is the risk of financial or reputational loss that can result from lack of awareness or misunderstanding of, ambiguity in, or reckless indifference to, the way law and regulation apply to your business, its relationships, processes, products and services.\n\nThe cost and loss of income caused by legal uncertainty, multiplied by possibility of the individual event or legal environment as a whole.\n\nOne of the most obvious legal risks of doing business not mentioned in the above definitions is the risk of arrest and prosecution.\n\nAll definitions contain more detail.\n"}

Weill's Shearson Hayden Stone. Although the firm would operate as Shearson Loeb Rhoades for two years, the firm would ultimately be acquired in 1981 by American Express to form Shearson/American Express and three years later Shearson Lehman/American Express.\n\nThe firm was founded as Carl M. Loeb & Co. by father Carl M. Loeb and son John Langeloth Loeb Sr. in 1931, shortly after the onset of the Great Depression. Carl M. Loeb & Co. merged with Rhoades & Company, a white shoe Wall Street brokerage firm, in 1937 to form what became Loeb, Rhoades & Co. Rhoades & Company had been founded in 1905 by John Harsen Rhoades, Jr. (born 1869), formerly a partner of Rhoades & Richmond. The firm operated under the Loeb, Rhoades name from 1937 through 1979 when it briefly used the name Shearson Loeb Rhoades, for two years prior to its acquisition by American Express in 1981.\n\nCarl Loeb, who had built his personal wealth as president of American Metal Company resigned from the company and bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, at the urging of his son John in 1931. While on the New York Stock Exchange, he pushed through many reforms. Three years after Loeb left American Metals, the company's stock was nearly worthless. Together with his son, Carl ran Loeb, Rhoades for its first 24 years, from 1931 until his death in 1955. John L. Loeb was a partner in the firm from 1931 to 1955 and following the death of his father became the senior partner, a role which he retained through 1977 when the firm was merged. In 1951, John Loeb became a governor of the New York Stock Exchange. In 1956, Loeb, Rhoades acquired a controlling interest in the Cuban Atlantic Sugar Company and sold its stake on December 31, 1958, a day before the Cuban Revolution.\n\nIn 1973, Carl M. Mueller assumed management control of the firm before Loeb resumed his management responsibilities in the firm in 1977. Loeb oversaw the merger of Loeb, Rhoades with Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes & Trask to form Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. in January 1978 before handing over day to day control of the firm to his nephew, Thomas Kempner, a grandson of Carl Loeb who had joined the firm in 1950.\n\nThe Hornblower merger turned out to be disastrous for Loeb, Rhoades. The two firms incurred significant costs attempting to merge their back office operations, both of which had issues prior to the merger. By the end of 1978, less than a year after the merger, the combined firm was losing millions of dollars. Through the 1960s and 1970s, Sanford I. Weill was acquiring brokerage firms and by 1979 was running Shearson Hayden Stone, the culmination of nearly a dozen acquisitions. By early 1979, Loeb, Rhoades, now known as Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co. was suffering and looking for a potential acquiror. During Mothers Day Weekend 1979, Loeb and Shearson agreed to a merger to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades. Weill was named the CEO of the combined firm and John Loeb became the firm's chairman. At the time, Shearson Loeb Rhoades was among the largest investment banking houses with $250 million of equity capital.\n\nIn 1981, Shearson Loeb Rhoades bought the Boston Company, a money manager. The same year, Weill sold the combined company to American Express to form Shearson/American Express.\n\nLoeb Partners Corporation, a registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, had close ties with Loeb, Rhoades. Loeb Partners Corporation was founded by Thomas L. Kempner in 1982 to focus on managing assets for the Loeb family, wealthy clientele and institutions. Kempner, a grandson of Carl M. Loeb, was the final chairman of Loeb, Rhoades, serving from 1978 until the sale of the company in 1979.\n\nLoeb Partners launched the Loeb Arbitrage Fund in 1988 as an investment vehicle for the Loeb family and other family office clients.\n\nIn 2008, Loeb Capital Management, a d/b/a for Loeb Arbitrage Management, Loeb Offshore Management and Carl M.

It includes buildings nearby, as well as the square itself. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\n\nThe Main Street Market Square District has irregular boundaries. The district includes all of the blocks between Travis and Main from Texas Street to the northern boundary of University of Houstown-Downtown. From the southern edge of Market Square at Preston Street, it captures all of the blocks northward until Buffalo Bayou. It includes three and a half blocks between Main and Fannin Streets, running south from Franklin Street. A wedge-shaped, partial block at Milam falls within the district, as well as a partial block east of Main Street at the base of the viaduct.\n\nThe University of Houston–Downtown (UHD) is a four-year state university, located within the Main Street Market Square Historic District. Founded in 1974, it is one of four separate and distinct institutions in the University of Houston System. UHD has an enrollment of 12,900 students—making it the 13th largest public university in Texas and the second-largest university in the Houston area.\n\nOne of the anchors of the district is Market Square Park, so-named because this site previously hosted four Houston City Halls and City Markets.

Spanning , it is one of two beltways (the other being Interstate 495) around Boston, and is known as the \"inner\" beltway, especially around areas where it is or less outside of Boston. The original 128, called the \"Circumferential Highway,\" followed existing roadways in Boston suburbs and was designated in 1927. The present-day 128 exists as a controlled-access highway and was the first limited-access circumferential highway in the United States, the first segment of which opened in 1951.\n\nIts southern terminus was previously located at the Braintree Split in Braintree; currently, it exists at the interchange with Interstate 93 (I-93), Interstate 95 (I-95), and U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Canton. Despite no longer carrying this designation, the section of highway between Braintree and Canton continues to be informally called 128 within Massachusetts. At its current terminus, 128 begins running concurrently with I-95 and US 1. While its concurrency with US 1 ends in Dedham, its concurrency with I-95 continues as it intersects with expressways including I-90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) in Weston; US 20 in Waltham; Route 2 in Lexington; US 3 in Burlington (with which it runs concurrently within the town); and I-93 and US 1 again in Reading and Lynnfield, respectively. 128 and I-95 split in Peabody; as I-95 continues north towards New Hampshire, 128 travels east towards its northern terminus at an interchange with Route 127A in Gloucester.\n\nIn local culture, 128 is recognized as an informal dividing line between the inner municipalities of Greater Boston and the more distant suburbs. It delimits the areas accessible by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) public transit system, and is used to reference the high-technology industry that developed from the 1960s to the 1980s in the suburban areas along the highway.\n\n128 begins in Norfolk County in the south, at the interchange with I-93, I-95, and US 1 in Canton. Until the 1990s, its southern terminus was located at the junction of I-93, US 1, and Route 3 (the Braintree Split) in Braintree. At this present-day terminus, 128 becomes concurrent with I-95, and follows the sequential exit numbering scheme used by I-95 as it enters Massachusetts from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It also begins a wrong-way concurrency with US 1; as 128 and I-95 are signed traveling north, US 1 is signed traveling south, and vice versa. US 1 splits onto its own roadbed at exit 15 in Dedham.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Route 128 runs in tandem with I-95 from Canton north to Peabody, and after I-95 continues north from Peabody toward New Hampshire, north-east as its own signed highway from Peabody to Gloucester. The I-95 and I-93 signage were added in the mid-1970s when plans to construct I-95 through Boston, directly connecting the two I-95/Route 128 interchanges, were cancelled leaving an unsigned gap (filled in using Route 128). An unused cloverleaf in Canton, now removed, was one of the leftover structures from this plan as well as the existing Northeast Expressway (now part of US 1.)\n\nUntil 1965, while and shortly after the Route 3 freeway to Cape Cod was fully finished, the section of current Route 3 between exits 15 and 20 was also designated as Route 128. The route's southern end was then truncated to its intersection with Route 3 in Braintree. The non-freeway section of Route 128 from Route 3 through Hingham to Nantasket was redesignated Route 228. The Massachusetts Highway Department has tried twice, in 1997 and 2003, to truncate 128 back to its intersection with I-95 in Peabody, but local opposition has convinced them to back down.\n\nThe area along the western part of Route 128 is home to a number of high-technology firms and corporations. This part of Route 128 was dubbed \"America's Technology Highway\", and signs marking it that way were put in place beginning in October 1982. Two years later, those blue signs were changed to read \"America's Technology Region\" after complaints from veterans groups that noted the highway already had a name: the Yankee Division Highway, a name bestowed in 1941 in honor of the U.S. Army unit first formed in Boston in 1917.\n\nLike the I-95 signage mapping onto 128, the mapping of US 3 onto this stretch of 128 is due to US 3 as a separate limited access highway terminating in Burlington on 128 instead of further south at Route 2 in Lexington as originally envisioned. This abrupt termination requires the US 3 signage to continue along 128 for somewhat over a mile until it can interchange the old US 3 surface arterial. Moreover, when I-93 and Route 128 ran concurrently south of Boston, before the route was truncated to the I-95 interchange in Canton, they were signed in opposite directions, so it was possible to travel north on I-93 and south on Route 128 at the same time.\n\nThe northernmost several exits along Route 128, past exit 12, are not grade-separated interchanges. Exit 10 is signed as the signalized intersection with Route 127, and there are two rotaries between that and exit 12 (the Crafts Road interchange).\n\nFollowing the completion of the Peabody I-95/Route 128 interchange (Exit 45/29) in 1988; the exit system was changed from concurrency along 128 to a system using the I-95 exits. The exits, which had gone from Gloucester to Braintree, were renumbered along I-95, from the Rhode Island state line to the border with New Hampshire. Exit 37 had been the interchange with I-93, which also had its exit numbered 37 at that interchange. Coincidentally, with the renumbering, exit 37 remained exit 37.\n\nThe Boston area MPO studied the Route 128/I-95 Corridor from approximately 2005–2010. The study focused on the heavily congested section from I-90 (Newton) to US 3 (Burlington), and was completed in November 2010. As of 2010, the highway carried over 200,000 vehicles per day. Some possible improvements to Route 128 include HOV Lanes, reconstruction of shoulders, ramp metering, bus on shoulder, and fiber optic traffic system improvements. More studies will need to be completed before projects will begin.\n\nRoute 128 was assigned by 1927 along local roads, running from Route 138 in Milton around the west side of Boston to Route 107 (Essex Street or Bridge Street) in Salem. Its route was as follows:\nBy 1928, it had been extended east to Quincy from its south end along the following streets, ending at the intersection of Route 3 and Route 3A (now Route 3A and Route 53):\nThe first section of the new Circumferential Highway, in no way the freeway that it is now, was the piece from Route 9 in Wellesley around the south side of Boston to Route 3 (now Route 53) in Hingham. Parts of this were built as new roads, but most of it was along existing roads that were improved to handle the traffic. In 1931, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works acquired a right-of-way from Route 138 in Canton through Westwood, Dedham and Needham to Route 9 in Wellesley. This was mostly 80 feet (24 m) wide, only shrinking to 70 feet (21 m) in Needham, in the area of Great Plain Avenue and the Needham Line. Much of this was along new alignment, but about half — mostly in Needham — was along existing roads:\n\nFrom Route 138 in Canton east through the Blue Hills Reservation in Canton, Milton, Quincy and Braintree, Norfolk County acquired a right-of-way in 1927 and built the Blue Hill River Road. This tied into West Street in northwest Braintree, which itself had been taken over by the county in 1923.\n\nWest Street led to Route 37, which ran southeast to Braintree center. This part of Route 37 had been taken over by the state in 1919 (to Braintree center) and 1917 (in Braintree center).\n\nThe rest of the new highway, from Route 37 east to Route 3 (now Route 53), through Braintree, Weymouth and Hingham, was taken over by the state in 1929. This was all along existing roads, except possibly the part of Park Avenue west of Route 18 in Weymouth.\n\nBy 1933, the whole Circumferential Highway had been completed, and, except for the piece from Route 9 in Wellesley south to Highland Avenue in Needham, was designated as Route 128. Former Route 128 along Highland Avenue into Needham center was left unnumbered (as was the Circumferential Highway north of Highland Avenue), but the rest of former Route 128, from Needham center east to Quincy, became part of Route 135. Thus the full route of the Circumferential Highway, as it existed by 1933, is now the following roads:\n\nAt the same time as Route 128 was extended along the new Circumferential Highway, it was extended further into Hull. This alignment, not part of the Circumferential Highway, ran southeast on Route 3 (now Route 53) (Whiting Street) to the border of Hingham and Norwell, where it turned north on present Route 228 (Main Street) through Hingham and into Hull. The exact route through Hingham was Main Street, Short Street, Leavitt Street, East Street, and Hull Street. The end of the numbered route was at the south end of Nantasket Beach, where Nantasket Avenue curves northwest to follow the shore of Massachusetts Bay.\n\nIn 1955, \"Business Week\" ran an article titled \"New England Highway Upsets Old Way of Life\" and referred to Route 128 as \"the Magic Semicircle\". By 1958, it needed to be widened from four to six lanes, and business growth continued, often driven by technology out of Harvard University and MIT. In 1957, there were 99 companies employing 17,000 workers along 128; in 1965, 574; in 1973, 1,212. In the 1980s, the area was often compared to California's Silicon valley, and the positive effects of this growth on the Massachusetts economy were dubbed the \"Massachusetts Miracle\".\n\nMajor companies with significant locations in the broader Route 128 area prior to 2000 included:\nThe $315 million MassDOT Highway Division project has started widening on the project to upgrade the existing six-lane section of highway to eight lanes from north of Route 9 in Wellesley to Route 24 in Randolph. The project consists of adding a lane on the inside of each carriageway, complete with a 10-foot inside shoulder. The existing 1950s bridges, 22 in total, will be replaced as well. The project will be constructed in five phases over a twelve-year period. Construction of phase 1 began in 2004. The first phase of the project consisted of replacing the existing three-lane Route 128 bridges over University Avenue/MBTA/Amtrak and the Neponset River with new four-lane bridges in Canton. The project also included construction of a new two-lane ramp from Route 128 to I-95. The $33 million project was awarded to SPS New England of Salisbury.\n\nDuring the initial construction of Route 128, a provision had already been made for a fourth lane within the widely spaced median along the 1.5-mile (2.5 km) length of Route 128 running from just north of the U.S. Route 1 interchange in Dedham, Massachusetts, north-westwards to the Route 109 interchange, and this will finally be used for the Add-A-Lane project.\n\nConstruction on phase 1 was officially completed in October 2009. Construction of phase 2 of the project began in summer 2006. This phase of the project consisted of the replacement of the Route 1 and Route 1A bridges over Route 128 in Dedham along with the road widening between Exits 13 and 15 (US 1). Construction of four sound barriers between the US 1 and I-95 interchanges were also included. This phase was completed in the Spring of 2011.\n\nConstruction on phase 3, begun in April 2009, widened I-93/US 1 to 4 lanes in each direction from Route 24 to the I-95 interchange. Phase 4 of the Project, which began in March 2011, is replacing seven bridges and widens Route 128 (I-95) to four lanes in each direction from Route 109 to south of Highland Avenue in Needham. The southeastern freeway (Pilgrims Highway) that extends from Braintree to Cape Cod, MA Route 3, is also in the process of undergoing a similar \"add-a-lane\" project for much of its own 42 mile length.\n\nOver the last fifteen or so years, the state has funded a number of highway sign resigning projects on Route 128 that are replacing the 25-year-old signs with new exit, regulatory and route signs. Starting in 1998 and continuing through 2002, signs were replaced through a $1.1 million project between Reading and Lynnfield. Progress continued in 2005 and 2006 during a $2.2 million project which replaced the signs on from Peabody to Gloucester, and continued with a $1.4 million project in 2008 and 2009 that replaced signs in Peabody and the remaining ones in Lynnfield. A $2.9 million federal stimulus project helped replace exit and highway signs in 2010 and 2011 along Route 128 (I-95) from US-3 in Lexington to I-93 in Reading.\n\nA project begun in the Fall of 2012 and completed in the Fall of 2015, replaced exit & guide signs on Route 128 from Route 9 (Exit 20) in Wellesley to Routes 4/225 (Exit 31) in Lexington and, as part of the Add-A-Lane project discussed above, new signs were put up along section of the project completed in 2015 from Great Plain Avenue in Needham to Route 109 in Dedham. New signage was put up between I-95 and US 1 in 2010 and most of the signage between I-95 and Route 24 (on I-93/US 1) has been replaced by the end of 2011. Future projects will replace the signs between the Rhode Island Border and I-93 in Canton in 2018 and between I-93 in Reading and US 1 in Peabody in 2019. New mileage markers were placed every 2/10 of a mile along the highway in 2010 (except for the area covered by the widening project) for I-93 between Braintree and Canton and I-95 from Canton to Peabody. New markers put along Route 128 from Peabody to Gloucester reflect the state highway's total mileage from Canton, indicating MassDOT's change of heart in decommissioning the route where it shares the road with I-95. The previous mile markers (reflected in the exit list below) had mile 0 in Peabody.\n\nTwo songs by Massachusetts alternative rock artists, \"Roadrunner\" by The Modern Lovers and \"Blue Thunder\" by Galaxie 500, prominently feature Route 128 in their lyrics.\n\nExit numbers along the I-95 portion of Route 128 are in accordance to the I-95 exit numbering scheme in Massachusetts . The stretch north of I-95, as well as the rest of the length before I-95 exit numbering was applied, has decreasing exit numbers traveling northbound, contrary to almost all highways in the US with numbered exits. Route 128 currently has 18 numbered interchanges, starting at 29 (southbound) and continuing downwards to 9 (former Exit 27, an at-grade intersection, was removed, and the last two exits are at-grade intersections). This may be changed over the next few years if all freeway interchanges in Massachusetts are converted to mileage-based numbers under a project that was scheduled to start in January 2016, in order to comply with Federal regulations mandating mileage-based exit numbers on interstate highways, but that, for now, has been indefinitely postponed. The new numbers would abide by standard numbering rules and increase from 37 in Peabody to 54 in Gloucester with the traffic circles and at-grade intersections no longer receiving numbers.\n\n. After World War II, Route 128, dubbed by critics \"the road to nowhere,\" became the locus of high-tech development.\n\n"}

{"id": "32690625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32690625", "title": "Robinson Crusoe economy", "text": "Robinson Crusoe economy\n\nA Robinson Crusoe economy is a simple framework used to study some fundamental issues in economics. It assumes an economy with one consumer, one producer and two goods. The title \"Robinson Crusoe\" is a reference to the novel of the same name authored by Daniel Defoe in 1719.\n\nAs a thought experiment in economics, many international trade economists have found this simplified and idealized version of the story important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.\n\nIn the Robinson Crusoe economy, there is only one individual – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as consumer to maximise his utility. The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, Man Friday. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe. Along with this, conditions of Pareto Efficiency can be analysed by bringing in the concept of the Edgeworth box.\n\nThe basic assumptions of the Robinson Crusoe economy are as follows: \n\nRobinson Crusoe is assumed to be shipwrecked on a deserted island. Similar to the choices that households (suppliers of labour) face, Crusoe has only two activities to participate in – earn income or pass his time in leisure.\n\nThe income generating activity in this case is gathering coconuts. As usual, the more time he spends in leisure, the less food he has to eat, and conversely, the more time he spends gathering coconuts, the less time he has for leisure. This is depicted in figure 1.\nCrusoe's indifference curves depict his preferences for leisure and coconuts while the production function depicts the technological relationship between how much he works and how many coconuts he gathers. If the axes depicting coconut collection and leisure are reversed and plotted with Crusoe's indifference map and production function, figure 2 can be drawn:\n\nThe production function is concave in two dimensions and quasi-convex in three dimensions. This means that the longer Robinson works, the more coconuts he will be able to gather. But due to diminishing marginal returns of labour, the additional number of coconuts he gets from every additional hour of labour is declining.\n\nThe point at which Crusoe will reach an equilibrium between the number of hours he works and relaxes can be found out when the highest indifference curve is tangent to the production function. This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, the slope of the highest indifference curve must equal the slope of the production function.\n\nRecall that the Marginal rate of substitution is the rate at which a consumer is ready to give up one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of utility. Additionally, an input's marginal product is the extra output that can be produced by using one more unit of the input, assuming that the quantities of no other inputs to production change. Then,\n\nMP = MRS\n\nwhere,\n\nMP = Marginal Product of Labour, and\n\nMRS = Marginal rate of substitution between Leisure and Coconuts\n\nSuppose Crusoe decides to stop being a producer and consumer simultaneously. He decides he will produce one day and consume the next. His two roles of consumer and producer are being split up and studied separately to understand the elementary form of consumer theory and producer theory in microeconomics. For dividing his time between being a consumer and producer, he must set up two collectively exhaustive markets, the coconut market and the labour market. He also sets up a firm, of which he becomes the sole shareholder. The firm will want to maximise profits by deciding how much labour to hire and how many coconuts to produce according to their prices. As a worker of the firm, Crusoe will collect wages, as a shareholder, he will collect profits and as a consumer, he will decide how much of the firm's output to purchase according to his income and the prevailing market prices. Let's assume that a currency called \"Dollars\" has been created by Robinson to manage his finances. For simplicity, assume that Price = $1.00. This assumption is made to make the calculations in the numerical example easy because the inclusion of prices will not alter the result of the analysis. For more details, refer to Numéraire commodities.\n\nAssume that when the firm produces \"C\" amount of total coconuts, formula_1 represents its profit level. Also assume that when the wage rate at which the firm employs labour is \"w\", L amount of labour will be employed. Then,\n\nformula_2\n\nformula_3\n\nThe above function describes iso-profit lines (the locus of combinations between labour and coconuts that produce a constant profit of Π). Profits can be maximised when the marginal product of labour equals the wage rate (marginal cost of production). Symbolically,\n\nMP = \"w\"\n\nGraphically, the iso-profit line must be tangent to the production function.\n\nThe vertical intercept of the iso-profit line measures the level of profit that Robinson Crusoe's firm will make. This level of profit, Π, has the ability to purchase Π dollars worth of coconuts. Since Price is $1.00, Π number of coconuts can be purchased. Also, the firm will declare a dividend of Π dollars. This will be given to the firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.\n\nAs a consumer, Crusoe will have to decide how much to work (or indulge in leisure) and hence consume. He can choose to not work at all, since he has an endowment of Π dollars from being a shareholder. Let us instead consider the more realistic case of him deciding to work for a few hours. His labour consumption choice can be illustrated in figure 4:\n\nNote that labour is assumed to be a 'bad', i.e., a commodity that a consumer doesn't like. Its presence in his consumption basket lowers the utility he derives. On the other hand, coconuts are goods. This is why the indifference curves are positively sloped. The maximum amount of labour is indicated by L'. The distance from L' to the chosen supply of labour (L*) gives Crusoe's demand for leisure.\n\nNotice Crusoe's budget line. It has a slope of \"w\" and passes through the point (0,Π). This point is his endowment level i.e., even when he supplies 0 amount of labour, he has Π amount of coconuts (dollars) to consume. Given the wage rate, Crusoe will choose how much to work and how much to consume at that point where,\n\nMRS = \"w\"\n\nAt equilibrium, the demand for coconuts will equal the supply of coconuts and the demand for labour will equal the supply of labour.\n\nGraphically this occurs when the diagrams under consumer and producer are superimposed. Notice that,\n\nMRS = \"w\"\n\nMP = \"w\"\n\n-=> MRS = MP\n\nThis ensures that the slopes of the indifference curves and the production set are the same.\n\nAs a result, Crusoe ends up consuming at the same point he would have if he made all the above decisions together. In other words, using the market system has the same outcome as choosing the individual utility maximisation and cost minimisation plans. This is an important result when put into a macro level perspective because it implies that there exists a set of prices for inputs and outputs in the economy such that the profit-maximising behaviour of firms along with the utility-maximizing actions of individuals results in the demand for each good equaling the supply in all markets. This means that a\ncompetitive equilibrium can exist. The merit of a competitive equilibrium is that an efficient allocation of resources is achievable. In other words, no economic agent can be made better off without making another economic agent worse off.\n\nLet's assume that there is another commodity that Crusoe can produce apart from coconuts, for example, fish. Now, Robinson has to decide how much time to spare for both activities, i.e. how many coconuts to gather and how many fish to hunt. The locus of the various combinations of fish and coconuts that he can produce from devoting different amounts of time to each activity is known as the production possibilities set. This is depicted in the figure 6:\n\nThe boundary of the production possibilities set is known as the Production-possibility frontier (PPF). This curve measures the feasible outputs that Crusoe can produce, with a fixed technological constraint and given amount of resources. In this case, the resources and technological constraints are Robinson Crusoe's labour.\n\nIt is crucial to note that the shape of the PPF depends on the nature of the technology in use. Here, technology refers to the type of returns to scale prevalent. In figure 6, the underlying assumption is the usual decreasing returns to scale, due to which the PPF is concave to the origin. In case we assumed increasing returns to scale, say if Crusoe embarked upon a mass production movement and hence faced decreasing costs, the PPF would be convex to the origin. The PPF is linear with a downward slope in two circumstances:\n\nSo in the Robinson Crusoe economy, the PPF will be linear due to the presence of only one input.\n\nSuppose that Crusoe can produce 4 pounds of fish or 8 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he devotes L hours to fish gathering and L hours to gathering coconuts, he will produce 4L pounds of fish and 8L pounds of coconuts. Suppose that he decides to work for 12 hours a day. Then the production possibilities set will consist of all combinations of fish, F, and coconuts, C, such that\n\nformula_4\n\nformula_5\n\nformula_6\n\nSolve the first two equations and substitute in the third to get,\n\nformula_7\n\nThis equation represents Crusoe's PPF. The slope of this PPF measures the Marginal rate of transformation (MRT), i.e., how much of the first good must be given up in order to increase the production of the second good by one unit. If Crusoe works one hour less on hunting fish, he will have 4 less fish. If he devotes this extra hour to collecting coconuts, he will have 8 extra coconuts. The MRT is thus,\n\nMRT \nformula_8 formula_9\n\nUnder this section, the possibility of trade is introduced by adding another person to the economy. Suppose that the new worker who is added to the Robinson Crusoe Economy has different skills in gathering coconuts and hunting fish. The second person is called \"Friday\".\n\nFriday can produce 8 pounds of fish or 4 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he too decides to work for 12 hours, his production possibilities set will be determined by the following relations:\n\nformula_10\n\nformula_11\n\nformula_6\n\nformula_13\n\nThus, MRT \nformula_8 formula_15\n\nThis means that for every pound of coconuts Friday gives up, he can produce 2 more pounds of fish.\n\nSo, we can say that Friday has a Comparative advantage in hunting fish while Crusoe has a comparative advantage in gathering coconuts. Their respective PPFs can be shown in the following diagram:\n\nThe joint production possibilities set at the extreme right shows the total amount of both commodities that can be produced by Crusoe and Friday together. It combines the best of both workers. If both of them work to gather coconuts only, the economy will have 144 coconuts in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday. (This can be obtained by setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here the slope of the joint PPF is -1/2.\n\nIf we want more fish, we should shift that person who has a comparative advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, the slope of the joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.\n\nAssume that there are c units of coconut and f units of fish available for consumption in the Crusoe Friday economy. Given this endowment bundle (c,f), the Pareto efficient bundle can be determined at the mutual tangency of Crusoe's and Friday's indifference curves in the Edgeworth box along the Pareto Set (Contract curve). These are the bundles at which Crusoe's and Friday's Marginal rate of substitution are equal.\nIn a simple exchange economy, the contract curve describes the set of bundles that exhaust the gains from trade. But in a Robinson Crusoe/Friday economy, there is another way to exchange goods – to produce less of one good and more of the other.\n\nFrom the figure 8, it is clear that an economy operating at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, there is a way to make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.\n\nThus for Pareto Efficiency,\n\nMRT = MRS \n\nThis can be achieved in a competitive market by decentralising production and consumption decisions, i.e. Crusoe and Friday will both solve their own problems of how much to consume and produce independently.\n\n\nUniversity Courses\n\nArticles\n"}

{"id": "29254716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29254716", "title": "Small and medium enterprises in Mexico", "text": "Small and medium enterprises in Mexico\n\nSmall and medium enterprises in Mexico generally called PYMEs (), are an important segment of the Mexican economy. They are classified in two types of small and medium enterprises: family businesses and non-family businesses.\n\nThe Mexican Government supports PyMEs since 2004. The Mexican Chamber of Economy with the help of the Mexican government creates different type of programs for the PyMEs that need to improve their participation in the national market and also for the international market. The PyMEs' size is classified by the number of employees they have. The main sectors are manufacturing, commerce and service.\n\nAs of 2006 there were about 4 million enterprises in Mexico. Out of those 4 million, 99.8% were small and medium enterprises. About 52% of the Mexican GDP is generated by small and medium size enterprises. While the remaining 48% relies on large enterprises. Small and medium size enterprises contribute with the 72% of the formal employment in Mexico. PyMEs are subdivided into: 15% for Micro, 14.5% for small and 22.5% for medium enterprises.\n\nPyMes can be classified by type and size. There is a manufacturing, commerce, and service type. Within these, PyMEs are classified according to the number of employees—10, 50, 250 and more than 250 respectively—into micro, small, medium, and large enterprises. Service enterprises are classed by those with have 10, 50, 100, and more than 100 employees.\n\nPyMEs throughout the nation are distributed by region. About 38% of them in the central part of the country, 17% locate southwest, 6% southeast, 12% northeast and 27% center-west.\n\nThere are two types of PyMEs in Mexico (according to their origin). Those that began as family businesses and those formed by more formal partnership. The ones that start as family business are small and only very few of them have some type of projection abroad. These are usually the ones who search for government support mainly for financial and training purposes. The other type of small and Medium size enterprises in Mexico are those who follow an established path. An example of this could be franchises, these do not have a problem of expanding abroad. Franchises are small projection of big enterprises who have already done the market research before entering a new zone. They have all the possible experience on expanding overseas and very little risk on failing because in most cases they go under the concept of a high brand awareness.\n\nPyMEs have been an important part of the country's development, especially in the area of exports. Due to their small size they are versatile, dynamic and have growth potential. This potential also includes entering international markets. They are a major source of job creation in the country and are the most likely to implement new technologies. Since many are located in different regions of the country, they foment local development. The main contribution to enterprises growth lies on PyMEs. The importance of small and medium size enterprises in Mexico has grown through time due to the positive effect these businesses have had on Mexico's economy. Since these enterprises continue becoming more important, government is focusing a lot on supporting them.\n\nOn the other hand, they also have some disadvantages. In general PyMEs have not development the habit of reinvesting to improve production or reinvest in equipment. They do not have enough economic resources to hire specialized employees nor to train current ones. This and lack of foresight can lead to insufficient sales, lack of competitiveness, inadequate customer service, low quality and higher prices. Because of the lack of quality control, legal problems such as dealing with VATs and defective products becomes an issue.\n\nSince 2004, Mexican government has had a number of programs to support PyMEs so that they help Mexico's economy growth. The government has two groups of programs to support PyMEs.The first group helps PyMEs to grow within the national market. The main programs are Emerging Programs, Productive Projects, Centros Mexico Emprende (Mexico undertake program), National System of Loan Guaranties, and Enterprises Consultancy.\n\nThe main objective of the \"Programas Emergentes\" (Emerging Programs) is to help the economic areas that have been affected by natural disasters. This program achieves this objective through loans with special payment conditions. This help is given to the PyMEs that stop their economic activity because of a natural disaster. The Emerging Programs are coordinated and supervised by \"Fondo PyMe.\" The regulations that this organization point out is that the PyMEs are supported with special resources with the concepts that the directive council determine that are essential to the economic reactivation of the enterprises. These enterprises have to satisfy certain conditions. \"Proyectos Productivos\" (Productive Projects) helps to finance investment projects that improve the competitiveness of PyMes. This helps to trigger the creation and maintenance of jobs and regional development. The most important project is the financing. These funds are mostly targeted to production projects. The projects have to help by developing, expansion and consolidation of the enterprises. The \"Centros Mexico Emprende\" (Mexico undertake program) is for the execution of public or private services to support PyMEs. The support is given in a comprehensive, accessible, lively, and timely way according to the size and the enterprises potential. The different types of center concepts are: fitting out and infrastructure, designing and updating information systems for planning, and measuring of results generated from the \"Centros Mexico Emprende.\" \"Sistema Nacional de Garantias\" (National System of Loan Guaranties) provides PyMEs with easy access to the financing programs with competitive conditions and payment periods. The \"Consultoria Empresarial\" (Enterprises Consultancy) is a program that helps PyMEs be more productive and profitable. It achieves this objective through the identification of business intervention programs. These programs are applied to one or more fundamental areas of an enterprise as training and consultancy and the development of instructors and consultants.\n\nThe second group helps PyMEs to maintain a place and to succeed in the international market. The SPyME (Subsecretaría para la Pequeña y Mediana Empresa) was created to promote, encourage, and design tools and programs with the purpose of creating, consolidating and developing micro, small, and medium enterprises in the international market. The Sub-secretary for Small and Medium Enterprise (SPYME), with the purpose of helping primarily small enterprises, created the \"Programa Nacional de Capacitación y Consultoría\" (National Program for Training and Consultancy). This program incorporates improvement actions in areas where weaknesses or opportunities are detected. The program stimulates the consolidation of the entrepreneurship through actions like the instrumentation of innovative methodologies in productive priority sectors. The program also foments the application of strategic programs to improve enterprises management.\n\nThe National Program of Training and Consultancy (Programa Nacional de Capacitación y Consulta) divides its operation in four components. The \"Programa de Consultoría General\" (Program of General Consultancy), that was created for the projects of major demand identified by chambers and managerial associations, that as well as for state and municipal governments, will look for the support of the Fondo PyME (Fund SME). This program was made to take care of the needs of training and consultancy, across proven methodologies that assure they will have quantifiable results. The \"Programa Moderniza\" (Modernization Program), the Secretary of Economy (SE) and the Secretary of Tourism (SECTUR) started a System of Management named \"Modernize\" that allows to improve the quality of the services offered to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises of the tourist sector. The Secretary of Tourism carries out the consultants' formation, which are the only ones authorized to execute the program and to register in SECTUR. The \"Formación de Consultores PyME – JICA\" (SME Consultants' Formation – JICA) establishes the formation of advisers specialized in the methodology of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The process is based on the application of Japanese tools of improvements of high impact with a lower cost. It lasts approximately one month and a half, and is directed to consultants with more than three years of experience in managerial consultancy. This has allowed relying on a base of specialized consultants that multiplies the efforts to offer specialized services of consultancy that generate more competitive enterprises. The \"Consultoría Empresarial PyME\" (SME Managerial Consultancy-JICA) estimulates the development and consolidation of the MIPyMES by the application of a model of integral attention of standardized consultancy, carried out by the consultants PYME-JICA and accredited by the Secretary of Economy. The process of consultancy that is offered in the facilities of the company lasts from 3 to 4 months, and is directed for MIPYMES, preferably with two years of operation. The Fondo PyME (Fund SME), along with the National Program of Consultancy PYME-JICA, helps with subsidies that go from 30 to 70 percent of the total cost of the service of managerial consultancy.\n\nIt is proven that many economies are based on their exports. Well organized and structured PyMEs can be a significant source of exports. For this reason, the Mexican government is giving special attention to PyMEs in this regard, allocating a big part of its economic resources to help small and medium size enterprises expand overseas. Supported PyMEs can mean increasing exports and a more open economy.\n\nThe \"Subsecretaria para la pequena y mediana empresa\" (SPyME) was founded to design, foment and promote programs and other tools that have as objective the creation, consolidation and development of micro, small and medium size enterprises.\n\nAbout 59% of Mexico's exports are controlled by 30% of the total enterprises in the country. Out of all the PyMEs existing only 9% of them export, while the remaining 83% do not have any type of presence overseas. International Commerce in Mexico is mainly based on big enterprises, this is why government is very interested on giving assistance and financial help to small businesses.\n\nOut of all the exporting enterprises in Mexico only 64,000 are PyMEs. They are located mostly in the center part of the country, northeast and centerwest.\n\nThere are many ways PyMEs can be supported in Mexico. Fiscal support to Mexican exporters. VAT return or VAT compensation. Program of foment for the manufacturing industry maquiladora and export services (IMMEX). Also through the program of sectorial promotion. Program of Drawback ( through which Government offers VAT return to those Mexican small businesses that export to a country that has imposed tariffs on imports). There are Benefits to High level exporting enterprises (ALTEX). Benefits to International commerce enterprises (ECEX). Mechanisms of Indirect Exports such as VAT elimination or Application of 0% VAT on exports. Mixed Commission for the Promotion of exports (COMPEX). An annual incentive named National Exporting Price. Government aid such as information or opportunities to expand overseas, consultancy and training. Commercial opportunities such as analysis of the market. Selection and establishment of contact with client within the foreign market. Government may also support PyMEs though a Positioning process.\n\nThe most important programs supporting for exports are Financing, Consultancy, Training, Exporting, Technical Assistance and Information on exports.\n\nThe services that the \"Programa Nacional de Franquicias\" (Exemption National Program) offers to PyMES are: commercialization, consultancy and financing. Likewise, they approach to the entrepreneurs, MIPyMES and owners of exemptions, to give them supports that offer the opportunity to start a new business taking advantage of the experience of an exemption, stimulate successful business to turn them into exemptions, develop new exemptions. Support the consolidation of the existing exemptions. Export models of Mexican exemptions. Strengthen the positioning of the brand of the existing exemptions and realize the re-engineering of existing models of exemptions.\n\nThe PyMExporta Centers are federal, states and local organizations who have the objective of helping the PyMEs that have the special interest to start, increase, or to diversify their exports worldwide. This organizations join efforts with the Business Mexican Sector to achieve this aim.\n\nSome of the advantages and benefits that the centers bring to PyMEs are the training of the export process, a specialized consultancy for the development of export projects, the possibility of being able of promote the PyMEs in the international market, consultancy in customs Mexico requirements, information about markets and legal regulations for exports and the support in the tasks of logistics and management. The PyMExporta Centers work with their own register methodology, accompaniment and management of institutional supports according with what the businesses require. The supporting service is personal and specialized for each need of the enterprises.\n\nServices are given depending on the levels of the identification of the enterprises potential, in case the enterprises have the facilities to export its product a document will be signed for the development of each process stage of the export. The commerce strategy identifies the requirements of the product, it supports and advises the businessman since the beginning of the contract of international sale until the end of the sale.\n\n"}

When launching a project/program Kimball et al. suggests following three focus areas:\n\nThis is an ongoing discipline in the project. The purpose is to keep the project/program on course, develop a communication plan and manage expectations.\n\nThis phase/milestone of the project is about making the project team understand the business requirements. Its purpose is to establish a foundation for all the following activities in the lifecycle. Kimball et al. makes it clear that it is important for the project team to talk with the business users and be prepared to focus on listening and to document the interview. An output of this step is the Enterprise bus matrix.\n\nThe top track holds two milestones:\n\n\nDimensional Modeling is a process in which the business requirements are used to design dimensional models for the system. \n\nPhysical Design is the phase where the database is designed. It involves the database environment as well as security. \n\nETL Design & Development is the design of some of the heavy procedures in the DW/BI-system (Extract, Transform, Load). Kimball et al. suggests four parts to this process, which are further divided into 34 subsystems (Kimball et al., 2008):\n\nBI Application Design deals with designing and selecting some applications to support the business requirements. BI Application Development use the design to develop and validate applications to support the business requirements.\n\nWhen the three tracks are complete they all end up in the final deployment. This phase requires planning and should include pre-deployment testing, documentation, training and maintenance and support.\n\nWhen the deployment has finished the system will need proper maintenance to stay alive. This includes data reconciliation, execution and monitoring and performance tuning.\n\nAs the project can be seen as part of the larger iterative program, it is likely that the system will want to expand.

This was followed shortly by a church wedding in June 2005, their marriage annulled in 2008. Prior to his marriage to Almoro, Revillame was married to actress Princess Punzalan.\n\nOn February 4, 2006, while Willie was hosting \"Wowowee\", the PhilSports Arena stampede occurred.\n\nOn August 25, 2007, the Department of Justice dismissed criminal charges against Revillame in connection with the stampede. However, Justice Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez affirmed the charge against 14 others, including ABS-CBN officials.\n\nIn the August 3, 2009 episode of \"Wowowee\", during which the show was interrupted for live coverage of the transfer of President Cory Aquino's remains from La Salle Greenhills to the Manila Cathedral, Revillame said that he could not make people happy while the entire country was mourning. The Alliance of Filipino Journalists denounced his remarks as a sign of disrespect towards Aquino. Revillame said he had no intention of defaming the former president and her family. ABS-CBN senior executive Cory Vidanes said the network supported Revillame's action, stating that his outburst did not run afoul of the Broadcast Code of the Philippines. Network entertainment official Johnny Manahan said Revillame was correct in saying that the footage should not have been inserted, but the way he said it was wrong.\n\nOn May 4, 2010, Revillame went into another on-air tirade on his now-defunct noontime show \"Wowowee\", this time directing his anger at entertainment columnist and DZMM Radio host Jobert Sucaldito. Without mentioning him by name, he said he had enough of Sucaldito's alleged criticisms against the show having high-school contestants whose grades were below the passing mark for the Willie of Fortune segment and also ridiculing them on-screen. He threatened to resign from the show unless the ABS-CBN management dismissed Sucaldito, who described Revillame's rant as being \"pikon\" (Tagalog slang meaning 'touchy'). He went on an indefinite leave three weeks later after the network declined his resignation letter.\n\nIn a press conference on August 9, 2010, Revillame announced that he was ending his contract with ABS-CBN, even if it is supposed to expire in September 2011. He also accused ABS-CBN of violating several provisions in his contract. He narrated that his decision came out of meetings between ABS-CBN production head Linggit Tan and network president Charo Santos-Concio regarding a return to the show on July 31. However, on July 20, Tan said the management will replace \"Wowowee\" with a new show on July 31 and also offered him a one-hour weekly show. She added negative feedback still prevailed among network employees about him going to work again. Despite the move, the network stated that Revillame's Wowowee tirade only highlighted his arrogance and stressed that the contract is still in effect.\n\nOn March 12, 2011, a \"macho dance\" by an apparently unhappy six-year-old boy on Revillame's primetime show, \"Willing Willie\", resulted in criticism, including the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development describing it as a case of child abuse. Revillame \"sincerely and deeply\" apologized for the segment, “which viewers may have found offensive or in bad taste.” The Commission on Human Rights pursued an investigation of the program for violating the law. In October 2015, the Court of Appeals allowed the arrest and prosecution of Revillame over the case. Atty. Nards de Vera, lawyer of Revillame, clarified in a GMA News article that Revillame has already posted the bail for the two cases in September 2013, and does not need the warrant of arrest served against his client.\nOn April 11, 2016, the 3rd division of the Court of Appeal (CA) had affirmed the Regional Trial Court Quezon City Judge Roberto Buenaventura Decision. The CA said that Judge Buenaventura hadn't committed no grave abuse of discretion. In the CA's Decision, written by Justice Maria Luisa Quijano-Padilla, on the arrest and to bring to trial Willie Revillame, they said, \" “as there is probable cause for the petitioner’s commission of a crime, his arrest and arraignment should now ensue so that this case may properly proceed to trial, where the merits of both parties’ evidence and allegations may be weighed.”\n\nTheme song of \"Gandang Filipina\" beauty contest segment of GMA 7 gameshow \"Wowowin\".\n\nCovered by Anja Aguilar for the theme song of TV5 primetime drama \"P .
