Koch Industries is ranked 2 among the Forbes list of largest private companies. Chrysler Realty Corporation purchases, leases or options dealership facilities and then leases or subleases these facilities to Chrysler dealers. The name ABKO was derived from the first two letters of Ablah’s name and the first two letters of Charles Koch’s name, who is head of Koch Industries. At the time ABKO was formed, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nABKO purchased around 840 Chrysler automotive dealership sites around the country controlled by Iacocca in 1979 for slightly over $100 million in cash. Not all the sites were owned by Chrysler Realty.\n\nUnder the leadership of Ablah and his team, Chrysler Realty president Ed Homer (for a brief time), executive vice president Corliss (Corky) Nelson of Koch, acquisition/disposition specialists Wayne Delfino and Frank Mills, and attorney John Schippel, among others, ABKO set forth a strategy to diversify Chrysler Realty Corporation by way of liquidating non-performing Chrysler dealership properties by tax-free exchange and sale.\n\nIn 1983, Iacocca, assisted by a government bailout he organized, repurchased 446 of the dealerships in a measure aimed at strengthening the Chrysler dealer network. ABKO dissolved shortly thereafter.\n"}

In the context of children, parents may provide an allowance (British English: pocket money) to their child for their miscellaneous personal spending. In the construction industry it may be an amount allocated to a specific item of work as part of an overall contract.\n\nThe person providing the allowance is usually trying to control how or when money is spent by the recipient so that it meets the aims of the person providing the money. For example, an allowance by a parent might be motivated to teach the child money management and may be unconditional or be tied to completion of chores or achievement of specific grades.\n\nThe person supplying the allowance usually specifies the purpose and may put controls in place to make sure that the money is spent for that purpose only. For example, a company employee may be given an allowance or per diem to provide for meals and travel when working away from home and may then be required to provide receipts as proof. Or they are provided with specific non-money tokens or vouchers that can be used only for a specific purpose such as a meal voucher.\n\nIn construction, an allowance is an amount specified and included in the construction contract (or specifications) for a certain item of work (e.g., appliances, lighting, etc.) whose details are not yet determined at the time of contracting. Typically:\n\nThe allowance provisions may be handled otherwise in the contract: e.g., the flooring allowance may state that installation costs are part of the allowance.

{"id": "1510587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1510587", "title": "Bayesian search theory", "text": "Bayesian search theory\n\nBayesian search theory is the application of Bayesian statistics to the search for lost objects. It has been used several times to find lost sea vessels, for example the USS \"Scorpion\". It also played a key role in the recovery of the flight recorders in the Air France Flight 447 disaster of 2009. Currently, it is being used to locate the remains of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.\n\nThe usual procedure is as follows:\n\nIn other words, first search where it most probably will be found, then search where finding it is less probable, then search where the probability is even less (but still possible due to limitations on fuel, range, water currents, etc.), until insufficient hope of locating the object at acceptable cost remains.\n\nThe advantages of the Bayesian method are that all information available is used coherently (i.e., in a \"leak-proof\" manner) and the method automatically produces estimates of the cost for a given success probability. That is, even before the start of searching, one can say, hypothetically, \"there is a 65% chance of finding it in a 5-day search. That probability will rise to 90% after a 10-day search and 97% after 15 days\" or a similar statement. Thus the economic viability of the search can be estimated before committing resources to a search.\n\nApart from the USS \"Scorpion\", other vessels located by Bayesian search theory include the MV \"Derbyshire\", the largest British vessel ever lost at sea, and the SS \"Central America\". It also proved successful in the search for a lost hydrogen bomb following the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash in Spain, and the recovery in the Atlantic Ocean of the crashed Air France Flight 447.\n\nBayesian search theory is incorporated into the CASP (Computer Assisted Search Program) mission planning software used by the United States Coast Guard for search and rescue. This program was later adapted for inland search by adding terrain and ground cover factors for use by the United States Air Force and Civil Air Patrol.\n\nSuppose a grid square has a probability \"p\" of containing the wreck and that the probability of successfully detecting the wreck if it is there is \"q\". If the square is searched and no wreck is found, then, by Bayes' theorem, the revised probability of the wreck being in the square is given by\n\nFor every other grid square, if its prior probability is \"r\", its posterior probability is given by\n\nIn May 1968, the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine USS \"Scorpion\" (SSN-589) failed to arrive as expected at her home port of Norfolk, Virginia. The command officers of the U.S. Navy were nearly convinced that the vessel had been lost off the Eastern Seaboard, but an extensive search there failed to discover the remains of \"Scorpion\".\n\nThen, a Navy deep-water expert, John P. Craven, suggested that \"Scorpion\" had sunk elsewhere. Craven organised a search southwest of the Azores based on a controversial approximate triangulation by hydrophones. He was allocated only a single ship, \"Mizar\", and he took advice from a firm of consultant mathematicians in order to maximise his resources. A Bayesian search methodology was adopted. Experienced submarine commanders were interviewed to construct hypotheses about what could have caused the loss of \"Scorpion\".\n\nThe sea area was divided up into grid squares and a probability assigned to each square, under each of the hypotheses, to give a number of probability grids, one for each hypothesis. These were then added together to produce an overall probability grid. The probability attached to each square was then the probability that the wreck was in that square. A second grid was constructed with probabilities that represented the probability of successfully finding the wreck if that square were to be searched and the wreck were to be actually there. This was a known function of water depth. The result of combining this grid with the previous grid is a grid which gives the probability of finding the wreck in each grid square of the sea if it were to be searched.\n\nAt the end of October 1968, the Navy's oceanographic research ship, , located sections of the hull of \"Scorpion\" on the seabed, about southwest of the Azores, under more than of water. This was after the Navy had released sound tapes from its underwater \"SOSUS\" listening system, which contained the sounds of the destruction of \"Scorpion\". The court of inquiry was subsequently reconvened and other vessels, including the bathyscaphe \"Trieste II\", were dispatched to the scene, collecting many pictures and other data.\n\nAlthough Craven received much credit for locating the wreckage of \"Scorpion\", Gordon Hamilton, an acoustics expert who pioneered the use of hydroacoustics to pinpoint Polaris missile splashdown locations, was instrumental in defining a compact \"search box\" wherein the wreck was ultimately found. Hamilton had established a listening station in the Canary Islands that obtained a clear signal of what some scientists believe was the noise of the vessel's pressure hull imploding as she passed crush depth. A Naval Research Laboratory scientist named Chester \"Buck\" Buchanan, using a towed camera sled of his own design aboard \"Mizar\", finally located \"Scorpion\". The towed camera sled, which was fabricated by J. L. \"Jac\" Hamm of Naval Research Laboratory's Engineering Services Division, is housed in the National Museum of the United States Navy. Buchanan had located the wrecked hull of \"Thresher\" in 1964 using this technique.\n\nThe classical book on this subject \"The Theory of Optimal Search\" (Operations Research Society of America, 1975) by Lawrence D. Stone won the 1975 Lanchester Prize by the American Operations Research Society.\n\nAssume that a stationary object is hidden in one of n boxes. For each box formula_3 there are three known parameters: the cost of a single\nsearch at location formula_3, formula_5; the probability of finding the object by a single search at location formula_3 if it is at this location, formula_7; and the probability that the object is at location formula_3, formula_9. A searcher looks for the object. They know the a priori probabilities at the beginning and update them by Bayes’ law after each (unsuccessful) attempt.\nThe problem of finding the object in minimal expected cost is a classical problem\nsolved by David Blackwell. Surprisingly, the optimal policy is easy to describe: at each stage look into the location which maximizes\nformula_10. This is actually a special case of Gittins index.\n\n\n"}

After his father's death at the hand of the fascists in 1943, Weiss fled with his mother to Italy and later to Switzerland.\nWhile growing up in a town on the shore of Lake Constance, he studied literature, art and history and developed an interest in natural sciences. He obtained his high-school diploma in Glarisegg in 1947. Subsequently, he enrolled at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich and graduated there with a degree in chemical engineering in 1951. During his studies he worked part-time as a lab technician. Weiss wrote a thesis on the cost-benefit analysis in the field of Filter (chemistry).\n\nWeiss has established several national and international high-tech companies. Kontron, a company he founded in 1959, was acquired by Hoffmann-La Roche in 1974. He was also the founder of Esec, a provider of semiconductor components that BE Semiconductor Industries N.V. acquired from OC Oerlikon in 2009. These companies were amongst the pioneers of the computer industry. Weiss was the founder and past president of the Swiss Venture Capital Association.\n\nWeiss was a frequent lecturer on innovation and high-tech entrepreneurships. He held lectures at the ETH Zurich from 1985 to 1994 on \"Technological Strategies\" and on \"Management of New Companies\". He was a board member and honorary member of the Swiss Academy of Engineering Science, an honorary member of the Swiss Engineers and Architects Society as well as the Alumni Association of ETH.\n\nWeiss patronized several universities and numerous cultural projects.\n\nIn 1987 Weiss together with Swatch founder Nicolas Hayek initiated the Swiss Technology Award.\n\nJointly with Israel's Ministry of Education, he founded the Branco Weiss Institute in Israel in 1990. The institute consists of 12 schools that promote learning competencies and thinking abilities to students and teachers.\n\nIn 2002, Weiss founded Society in Science – The Branco Weiss Fellowship, a fellowship for researchers shortly after their PhD from around the globe. The grant enables postdocs to work on a research topic of their choice for up to five years. In Spring 2010 he handed this organization worth 20 million Swiss francs over to the ETH. The fellowship’s research projects receive broad media coverage. Its fellows work on research projects that affect society, such as the analysis of how diseases spread through communities and how stress affects ageing. In 2009 fellow Riley Crane together with his research team at MIT won the DARPA Network Challenge. The Pentagon Prize was organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for developing new ways to understand how information is spread through social networks. According to his research team this technique could be used for finding criminals and missing persons. In his will Branco Weiss left an estimated 100 million Swiss francs to Society in Science – The Branco Weiss Fellowship.\n\nWeiss also donated 23 million Swiss francs in 2004 to the ETH’s “Science City” - an infrastructure project that helps transform the additional ETH campus built in the outskirts of Zurich into an attractive district.\nIn 2008 the Branco Weiss Information Science Laboratory, a state-of-the-art building in Science City, was inaugurated.\n\nDr. Weiss made one of the largest donations to Central European University (CEU) and also was a member of the team that developed the strategic plan of the University, which was applied in 2003.

{"id": "33123430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33123430", "title": "Buffett Rule", "text": "Buffett Rule\n\nThe Buffett Rule is part of a tax plan proposed by President Barack Obama in 2011. The tax plan would apply a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on individuals making more than one million dollars a year. According to a White House official, the new tax rate would directly affect 0.3 percent of taxpayers.\n\nThe Buffett Rule is named after American investor Warren Buffett, who publicly stated in early 2011 that he believed it was wrong that rich people, like himself, could pay less in federal taxes, as a portion of income, than the middle class, and voiced support for increased income taxes on the wealthy. The rule would implement a higher minimum tax rate for taxpayers in the highest income bracket, to ensure that they do not pay a lower percentage of income in taxes than less-affluent Americans. In October 2011, Senate leader Harry Reid (D–Nev.) proposed a 5.6 percent surtax on everyone making over a million dollars a year to pay for new stimulus provisions, but the change did not go through.\n\nA White House statement released in January 2012 defined the rule as part of \"measures to ensure everyone making over a million dollars a year pays a minimum effective tax rate of at least 30 percent ... implemented in a way that is equitable, including not disadvantaging individuals who make large charitable contributions.\" The White House also stated that \"no household making more than $1 million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle-class family pays.\"\n\nThe Buffett Rule was not in the President's 2012 budget proposal and the White House initially stressed it as a guideline rather than a legislative initiative. The rule, however, was later submitted for deliberation as US Senate Bill S. 2059, \"Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012\". On April 16, 2012, the bill received 51 affirmative votes, but was stopped by a Republican filibuster that required 60 votes to proceed to debate and a vote on final passage.\n\nIf enacted, the rule change would result in $36.7 billion per year in additional tax revenue ($367 billion over the next decade), according to a January 2012 analysis by the Tax Foundation, a think tank. These figures assume that the 2001/2003/2010 tax cuts are not extended. If the 2001-2010 tax cuts do not expire as scheduled, estimated Buffett Rule revenues would total $162 billion over the decade. An alternative study released that same month by the Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal think tank which favors the change, stated that the change would add $50 billion per year in tax revenue ($500 billion over the decade). The United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation released a letter in March 2012 estimating that the Buffett Rule would raise $46.7 billion over the next decade. The divergent estimates come about because of different assumptions about the details of the Buffett Rule. For example, the Joint Committee on Taxation assumes that many high-income taxpayers would reduce the amount of capital gains realized in one year to fall beneath the Buffett Rule threshold.\n\nThe estimated $47 billion would offset by 0.7% the $6.4 trillion increase in spending over the next decade estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, based on President Obama's 2013 budget plan. Using the higher estimate from the Tax Foundation, the estimated $367 billion would offset by 5.7% the $6.4 trillion spending over the next decade.\n\nThe 2013 budget proposed by the Obama administration stated that the Buffett Rule should replace the Alternative Minimum Tax. The Joint Committee on Taxation calculated that the Buffett Rule plus the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax would increase the deficit by $793.3 billion in the next decade. The $793.3 billion loss projected did not take into account additional proposed measures, such as incremental increases in retirement age and payroll tax lifetime contributions raised to $190,000 by 2020, about $22,000 higher than it would be under current law.\n\nPart of the reason for the inequality in taxation is that revenue from long-term capital gains is taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8%. It's not entirely clear how many individuals would be affected by the change. An October 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service found that a 30% minimum tax rate rule would mean up to 200,000 taxpayers, equivalent to 0.06% of all U.S. citizens, paying more.\n\nPaul Krugman, a \"New York Times\" columnist and Nobel Prize–winning economist, wrote in January 2012 that \"such low taxes on the very rich are indefensible\". He stated that \"the economic record certainly doesn’t support the notion that superlow taxes on the superrich are the key to prosperity\" asserting that since the U.S. economy added 11.5 million jobs during President Bill Clinton's first term, when the capital gains tax rate was over 29 percent, he thinks there's no real reason to keep from raising the tax rate.\n\nA CBS News/\"New York Times\" poll released in January 2012 found that 52 percent of Americans agreed that investments should be taxed at the same rate as income. A Gallup poll released in April 2012 also found that 60 percent of Americans support the rule. A similar poll released later that month by CNN found that 72 percent of Americans support the idea.\n\nRepresentative Paul Ryan (R–Wis.), who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee, criticized the new tax provisions. He labeled it as class warfare and also stated that it would negatively impact job creation and investment. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R–Ken.) said the conditions of the U.S. economy were ill-disposed to raising taxes. House Speaker John Boehner (R–Ohio) has spoken against the proposed rule and said that, \"there's a reason we have low rates on capital gains ... because it spurs new investment in our economy and allows capital to move more quickly.\" Dana Milbank from the \"Washington Post\" criticized the proposed tax as a gimmick, stating that President Obama was prioritizing the Buffett Rule over the Alternative Minimum Tax for political, not economic reasons.\n\n\n"}

An electronic mortgage letter is deemed to be pledged when the creditor has been registered as the bearer (holder) of the mortgage letter.\n\nThe company mortgage gives special priority rights on a businessman’s personal property that belongs to the business other than cash or bank funds, stock or other publicly traded financial instruments, property that cannot be seized or be included in a bankruptcy, or property that can be pledged in other ways, such as aircraft and ships during both the seizure of assets and bankruptcy under §5 of the Priority Rights Act (Förmånsrättslagen). A company mortgage pledged before another company mortgage has priority. Company mortgages pledged on the same day have equal rights. At the request of the bearer of a company mortgage letter, the holding can be registered in the corporate mortgage register.\n\nA decision by the registration authority may be appealed to District Court (Tingsrätt). In the appeal the Act on Court Cases (Lagen om Domstolsärenden) is applied. Anyone wishing to appeal a decision of the registration authority should do so in writing. The letter must be submitted to the registration authority.\n\nThe provisions relating to the company mortgage imply a return to the rules on company mortgages that applied before 2004.\n\n"}

The corona plasma is generated by the application of high voltage to an electrode that has a sharp tip. The plasma forms at the tip. A linear array of electrodes is often used to create a curtain of corona plasma. Materials such as plastics, cloth, or paper may be passed through the corona plasma curtain in order to change the surface energy of the material. All materials have an inherent surface energy. Surface treatment systems are available for virtually any surface format including dimensional objects, sheets and roll goods that are handled in a web format. Corona treatment is a widely used surface treatment method in the plastic film, extrusion, and converting industries.\n\nThe corona treatment was invented by the Danish engineer Verner Eisby in 1951. Verner had been asked by one of his customers if he could find a solution which would make it possible to print on plastic. \nVerner found that there were already a couple of ways to accomplish this. One was a gas flame method and the other was a spark generating method, both of which were crude and uncontrollable and did not produce a homogeneous product. Verner came up with the theory that a high frequency corona discharge would provide both a more efficient and controllable method to treat the surface. Exhaustive experiments proved him to be correct. Verner's company, Vetaphone, obtained patent rights for the new corona treatment system.\n\nMany plastics, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, have chemically inert and nonporous surfaces with low surface tensions causing them to be non-receptive to bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives. Although results are invisible to the naked eye, surface treating modifies surfaces to improve adhesion.\n\nPolyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, vinyl, PVC, PET, metalized surfaces, foils, paper, and paperboard stocks are commonly treated by this method. It is safe, economical, and delivers high line speed throughput. Corona treatment is also suitable for the treatment of injection and blow molded parts, and is capable of treating multiple surfaces and difficult parts with a single pass. \n\nCorona discharge equipment consists of a high-frequency power generator, a high-voltage transformer, a stationary electrode, and a treater ground roll. Standard utility electrical power is converted into higher frequency power which is then supplied to the treater station. The treater station applies this power through ceramic or metal electrodes over an air gap onto the material’s surface.\n\nTwo basic corona treater stations are used in extrusion coating applications—\"Bare Roll\" and \"Covered Roll\". On a bare roll treater station, the dielectric encapsulates the electrode. On a covered roll station, it encapsulates the treater base roll. The treater consists of an electrode and a base roll in both stations. In theory a covered roll treater is generally used to treat non-conductive webs, and a Bare Roll treater is used to treat conductive webs. However, manufacturers who treat a variety of substrates on the same production line may choose to use a Bare Roll treater.\n\nMany substrates provide a better bonding surface when they are treated at the time they are produced. This is called “pre-treatment.” The effects of corona treatment diminish over time. Therefore many surfaces will require a second “bump” treatment at the time they are converted to ensure bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives.\n\nOther technologies used for surface treatment include in-line atmospheric (air) plasma, flame plasma, and chemical plasma systems.\n\nAtmospheric-pressure plasma treatment is very similar to corona treatment but there are a few differences between them. Both treatments may use one or more high voltage electrodes which charge the surrounding blown gas molecules and ionizes them. However in atmospheric plasma systems, the overall plasma density is much greater which enhances the rate and degree to which the ionized molecules are incorporated onto a materials' surface. An increased rate of ion bombardment occurs which may result in stronger material bonding traits depending on the gas molecules used in the process. Atmospheric plasma treatment technology also eliminates a possibility of treatment on a material's non-treated side; also known as backside treatment.\n\nFlame plasma treaters generate more heat than other treating processes, but materials treated through this method tend to have a longer shelf-life. These plasma systems are different from air plasma systems because flame plasma occurs when flammable gas and surrounding air are combusted into an intense blue flame. Objects’ surfaces are polarized from the flame plasma affecting the distribution of the surface’s electrons in an oxidation form. This treatment requires higher temperatures so many of the materials that are treated with a flame plasma can be damaged.\n\nChemical plasma is based on the combination of air plasma and flame plasma. Much like air plasma, chemical plasma fields are generated from electrically charged air. But, instead of air, chemical plasma relies on a mixture of other gases depositing various chemical groups onto the treated surface.\n\n\n"}

However, most states will not apply this doctrine to protect a person who was \"aware\" that the incorporation effort was defective at the time that they purported to act on behalf of the corporation.\n\nCorporation by estoppel, on the other hand, applies against someone who operates a business \"as if it were\" a limited liability entity or corporation, irrespective of whether there was a good faith effort by the business to incorporate. The person doing business with such an entity, as if it were a limited liability entity or corporation, may later be estopped from arguing that it is not in fact a limited liability entity, in an attempt to reach the assets of the incorporators. For the same reason, defendants who had acted as a corporation will be estopped from denying liability as a corporation when sued by a plaintiff who had relied on the defendant's corporate form when dealing with the defendant.\n\nBoth doctrines are applicable in the contract context but the estoppel concept typically does not apply where tort liability is sought because knowledge of corporate existence is irrelevant to the commission of tort. The harm caused by a tortious act normally does not depend on knowledge, or lack thereof, of a corporation's existence.\n"}
{"id": "7084228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7084228", "title": "Eight disciplines problem solving", "text": "Eight disciplines problem solving\n\nEight disciplines (8Ds) problem solving is a method developed at Ford Motor Company used to approach and to resolve problems, typically employed by engineers or other professionals. Focused on product and process improvement, its purpose is to identify, correct, and eliminate recurring problems. It establishes a permanent corrective action based on statistical analysis of the problem and on the origin of the problem by determining the root causes. Although it originally comprised eight stages, or 'disciplines', it was later augmented by an initial planning stage. 8D follows the logic of the PDCA cycle. The disciplines are:\n8Ds has become a standard in the automotive, assembly, and other industries that require a thorough structured problem-solving process using a team approach.\n\nThe executives of the Powertrain Organization (transmissions, chassis, engines) wanted a methodology where teams (design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and production) could work on recurring chronic problems. In 1986, the assignment was given to develop a manual and a subsequent course that would achieve a new approach to solving identified engineering design and manufacturing problems. The manual for this methodology was documented and defined in \"Team Oriented Problem Solving\" (TOPS), first published in 1987. The manual and subsequent course material were piloted at Ford World Headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. Ford refers to their current variant as G8D (Global 8D). The Ford 8Ds manual is extensive and covers chapter by chapter how to go about addressing, quantifying, and resolving engineering issues. It begins with a cross-functional team and concludes with a successful demonstrated resolution of the problem. Containment actions may or may not be needed based on where the problem occurred in the life cycle of the product.\n\nMany disciplines are typically involved in the \"8Ds\" methodology. The tools used can be found in textbooks and reference materials used by quality assurance professionals. For example, an \"Is/Is Not\" worksheet is a common tool employed at D2, and Ishikawa, or \"fishbone,\" diagrams and \"5-why analysis\" are common tools employed at step D4.\nIn the late 1990s, Ford developed a revised version of the 8D process that they call \"Global 8D\" (G8D), which is the current global standard for Ford and many other companies in the automotive supply chain. The major revisions to the process are as follows:\n\n\nRecently, the 8D process has been employed significantly outside the auto industry. As part of lean initiatives and continuous-improvement processes it is employed extensively in the food manufacturing, health care, and high-tech manufacturing industries.\n\nThe benefits of the 8D methodology include effective approaches to finding a root cause, developing proper actions to eliminate root causes, and implementing the permanent corrective action. The system also helps to explore the control systems that allowed the problem to escape. The Escape Point is studied for the purpose of improving the ability of the Control System to detect the failure or cause when and if it should occur again.\nFinally the Prevention Loop explores the systems that permitted the condition that allowed the Failure and Cause Mechanism to exist in the first place.\n\nRequires training in the 8D problem-solving process as well as appropriate data collection and analysis tools such as Pareto charts, fishbone diagrams, and process maps.\n\nThe following tools can be used within 8D:\n\nThe 8D methodology was first described in a Ford manual in 1987. The manual describes the eight-step methodology to address chronic product and process problems. The 8Ds included several concepts of effective problem solving, including taking corrective actions and containing nonconforming items. These two steps have been very common in most manufacturing facilities, including government and military installations. In 1974, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) released “MIL-STD 1520 Corrective Action and Disposition System for Nonconforming Material”. This 13 page standard defines establishing some corrective actions and then taking containment actions on nonconforming material or items. It is focused on inspection for defects and disposing of them. The basic idea of corrective actions and containment of defectives was officially abolished in 1995, but these concepts were also common to Ford Motor Company, a major supplier to the government in World War II. Corrective actions and containment of poor quality parts were part of the manual and course for the automotive industry and are well known to many companies. Ford's 60 page manual covers details associated with each step in their 8D problem solving manual and the actions to take to deal with identified problems.\n\nThe exact history of the 8D method remains disputed as many publications and websites state that it originates from the US military. Indeed, MIL-STD-1520C outlines a set of requirements for their contractors on how they should organize themselves with respect to non-conforming materials. Developed in 1974 and cancelled in February 1995 as part of the Perry memo, you can compare it best to the ISO 9001 standard that currently exists as it expresses the same philosophy. The aforementioned military standard does outline some aspects that are in the 8D method, however, it does not provide the same structure that the 8D methodology offers. Taking into account the fact that the Ford Motor Company played an instrumental role in producing army vehicles during the Second World War and in the decades after, it could very well be the case that the MIL-STD-1520C stood as a model for today’s 8D method.\n\nFMEA (failure mode and effect analysis) is a tool generally used in the planning of product or process design. The relationships between 8D and FMEA are outlined below:\nThe FMEA and 8D should reconcile each failure and cause by cross documenting failure modes, problem statements and possible causes. Each FMEA can be used as a database of possible causes of failure as an 8D is developed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "167703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167703", "title": "Empowerment", "text": "Empowerment\n\nThe term empowerment refers to measures designed to increase the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities in order to enable them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources. To do work with power.\n\nThe term empowerment originates from American community psychology and is associated with the social scientist Julian Rappaport (1981). However, the roots of empowerment theory extend further into history and are linked to Marxist sociological theory. These sociological ideas have continued to be developed and refined through Neo-Marxist Theory (also known as Critical Theory).\n\nIn social work, empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of citizenship education and democratic education, empowerment is seen as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen. Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting civic engagement. Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a deficit-oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of continuing education and self-help.\n\nRobert Adams points to the limitations of any single definition of 'empowerment', and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to. Still, he offers a minimal definition of the term: \n'Empowerment: the capacity of individuals, groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances, exercise power and achieve their own goals, and the process by which, individually and collectively, they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives.'\n\nOne definition for the term is \"an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources\".\n\nRappaport's (1984) definition includes: \"Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives.\"\n\nSociological empowerment often addresses members of groups that social discrimination processes have excluded from decision-making processes through – for example – discrimination based on disability, race, ethnicity, religion, or gender. Empowerment as a methodology is also associated with feminism.\n\nEmpowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for marginalized people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, self-sufficiency, with a focus on eliminating the future need for charity or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively.\n\nOne empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own nonprofit organization, using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. Red Cross, for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility – and credit – for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).\n\nThe process of which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal or collective power, authority and influence, and to employ that strength when engaging with other people, institutions or society. In other words, \"Empowerment is not giving people power, people already have plenty of power, in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation, to do their jobs magnificently. We define empowerment as letting this power out.\" It encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately, help them develop within themselves or in the society.\n\nTo empower a female \"...sounds as though we are dismissing or ignoring males, but the truth is, both genders desperately need to be equally empowered.\" Empowerment occurs through improvement of conditions, standards, events, and a global perspective of life.\n\nBefore there can be the finding that a particular group requires empowerment and that therefore their self-esteem needs to be consolidated on the basis of awareness of their strengths, there needs to be a deficit diagnosis usually carried out by experts assessing the problems of this group. The fundamental asymmetry of the relationship between experts and clients is usually not questioned by empowerment processes. It also needs to be regarded critically, in how far the empowerment approach is really applicable to all patients/clients. It is particularly questionable whether mentally ill people in acute crisis situations are in a position to make their own decisions. According to Albert Lenz, people behave primarily regressive in acute crisis situations and tend to leave the responsibility to professionals. It must be assumed, therefore, that the implementation of the empowerment concept requires a minimum level of communication and reflectivity of the persons involved.\n\nIn social work, empowerment offers an approach that allows social workers to increase the capacity for self-help of their clients. For example, this allows clients not to be seen as passive, helpless 'victims' to be rescued but instead as a self-empowered person fighting abuse/ oppression; a fight, in which the social worker takes the position of a facilitator, instead of the position of a 'rescuer'.\n\nMarginalized people who lack self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity, or welfare. They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting. The opportunities denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems. \"Marginalized\" here refers to the overt or covert trends within societies whereby those perceived as lacking desirable traits or deviating from the group norms tend to be excluded by wider society and ostracized as undesirables.\n\nAs a concept, and model of practice, empowerment is also used in health promotion research and practice.\nThe key principle is for individuals to gain increased control over factors that influence their health status . \n\nTo empower individuals and to obtain more equity in health, it is also important to address health-related behaviors . \n\nStudies suggest that health promotion interventions aiming at empowering adolescents should enable active learning activities, use visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allow the adolescents to influence intervention activities .\n\nAccording to Robert Adams, there is a long tradition in the UK and the USA respectively to advance forms of self-help that have developed and contributed to more recent concepts of empowerment. For example, the free enterprise economic theories of Milton Friedman embraced self-help as a respectable contributor to the economy. Both the Republicans in the US and the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher built on these theories. 'At the same time, the mutual aid aspects of the concept of self-help retained some currency with socialists and democrats.'\n\nIn economic development, the empowerment approach focuses on mobilizing the self-help efforts of the poor, rather than providing them with social welfare. Economic empowerment is also the empowering of previously disadvantaged sections of the population, for example, in many previously colonized African countries.\n\nThe World Pensions Council (WPC) has argued that large institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments are exercising a greater influence on the process of adding and replacing corporate directors – as they are themselves steered to do so by their own board members (pension trustees).\n\nThis could eventually put more pressure on the CEOs of publicly listed companies, as “more than ever before, many [North American], UK and European Union pension trustees speak enthusiastically about flexing their fiduciary muscles for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals”, and other ESG-centric investment practices \n\nLegal empowerment happens when marginalised people or groups use the legal mobilisation i.e., law, legal systems and justice mechanisms to improve or transform their social, political or economic situations. Legal empowerment approaches are interested in understanding how they can use the law to advance interests and priorities of the marginalised.\n\nAccording to 'Open society foundations' (an NGO) \"Legal empowerment is about strengthening the capacity of all people to exercise their rights, either as individuals or as members of a community. Legal empowerment is about grass root justice, about ensuring that law is not confined to books or courtrooms, but rather is available and meaningful to ordinary people.\n\nLorenzo Cotula in his book ' \"Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control\" ' outlines the fact that legal tools for securing local resource rights are enshrined in legal system, does not necessarily mean that local resource users are in position to use them and benefit from them. The state legal system is constrained by a range of different factors – from lack of resources to cultural issues. Among these factors economic, geographic, linguistic and other constraints on access to courts, \"lack of legal awareness as well as legal assistance \" tend to be recurrent problems.\n\nIn many context, marginalised groups do not trust the legal system owing to the widespread manipulation that it has historically been subjected to by the more powerful. 'To what extent one knows the law, and make it work for themselves with 'para legal tools', is legal empowerment; assisted utilizing innovative approaches like legal literacy and awareness training, broadcasting legal information, conducting participatory legal discourses, supporting local resource user in negotiating with other agencies and stake holders and to strategies combining use of legal processes with advocacy along with media engagement, and socio legal mobilisation.\n\nSometimes groups are marginalized by society at large, with governments participating in the process of marginalization. Equal opportunity laws which actively oppose such marginalization, are supposed to allow empowerment to occur. These laws made it illegal to restrict access to schools and public places based on race. They can also be seen as a symptom of minorities' and women's empowerment through lobbying.\n\nGender empowerment conventionally refers to the empowerment of women, which is a significant topic of discussion in regards to development and economics nowadays. It also points to approaches regarding other marginalized genders in a particular political or social context. This approach to empowerment is partly informed by feminism and employed legal empowerment by building on international human rights. Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing human rights and development. The Human Development and Capabilities Approach, The Millennium Development Goals, and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development. The UN Sustainable Development Goals targets gender equality and women's empowerment for the global development agenda.\n\nAccording to Thomas A. Potterfield, many organizational theorists and practitioners regard employee empowerment as one of the most important and popular management concepts of our time.\n\nCiulla discusses an inverse case: that of bogus empowerment.\n\nIn the sphere of management and organizational theory, \"empowerment\" often refers loosely to processes for giving subordinates (or workers generally) greater discretion and resources: distributing control in order to better serve both customers and the interests of employing organizations.\n\nOne account of the history of workplace empowerment in the United States recalls the clash of management styles in railroad construction in the American West in the mid-19th century, where \"traditional\" hierarchical East-Coast models of control encountered individualistic pioneer workers, strongly supplemented by methods of efficiency-oriented \"worker responsibility\" brought to the scene by Chinese laborers. In this case, empowerment at the level of work teams or brigades achieved a notable (but short-lived) demonstrated superiority. See the views of Robert L. Webb.\n\nSince the 1980s and 1990s, empowerment has become a point of interest in management concepts and business administration. In this context, empowerment involves approaches that promise greater participation and integration to the employee in order to cope with their tasks as independently as possible and responsibly can. A strength-based approach known as \"empowerment circle\" has become an instrument of organizational development. Multidisciplinary empowerment teams aim for the development of quality circles to improve the organizational culture, strengthening the motivation and the skills of employees. The target of subjective job satisfaction of employees is pursued through flat hierarchies, participation in decisions, opening of creative effort, a positive, appreciative team culture, self-evaluation, taking responsibility (for results), more self-determination and constant further learning. The optimal use of existing potential and abilities can supposedly be better reached by satisfied and active workers. Here, knowledge management contributes significantly to implement employee participation as a guiding principle, for example through the creation of communities of practice.\n\nHowever, it is important to ensure that the individual employee has the skills to meet their allocated responsibilities and that the company's structure sets up the right incentives for employees to reward their taking responsibilities. Otherwise there is a danger of being overwhelmed or even becoming lethargic.\n\nEmpowerment of employees requires a culture of trust in the organization and an appropriate information and communication system. The aim of these activities is to save control costs, that become redundant when employees act independently and in a self-motivated fashion. \nIn the book \"Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute\", the authors illustrate three keys that organizations can use to open the knowledge, experience, and motivation power that people already have. The three keys that managers must use to empower their employees are:\n\nAccording to Stewart, in order to guarantee a successful work environment, managers need to exercise the \"right kind of authority\" (p. 6). To summarize, \"empowerment is simply the effective use of a manager’s authority\", and subsequently, it is a productive way to maximize all-around work efficiency.\n\nThese keys are hard to put into place and it is a journey to achieve empowerment in a workplace. It is important to train employees and make sure they have trust in what empowerment will bring to a company.\n\nThe implementation of the concept of empowerment in management has also been criticised for failing to live up to its claims.\n\nMarshall McLuhan insisted that the development of electronic media would eventually weaken the hierarchical structures that underpin central governments, large corporation, academia and, more generally, rigid, “linear-Cartsesian” forms of social organization. \nFrom that perspective, new, “electronic forms of awareness” driven by information technology would empower citizen, employees and students by disseminating in near-real-time vast amounts of information once reserved to a small number of experts and specialists. Citizens would be bound to ask for substantially more say in the management of government affairs, production, consumption, and education \n\nWorld Pensions Council (WPC) economist Nicolas Firzli has argued that rapidly rising cultural tides, notably new forms of online engagement and increased demands for ESG-driven public policies and managerial decisions are transforming the way governments and corporation interact with citizen-consumers in the “Age of Empowerment” \n\n"}

When Janmaat was 4 years old, the family moved to Gouda, where it would endure the war years in relative peace.\nAfter graduating in 1954, Janmaat started a study in aeronautical engineering, but had to drop out two years later after his father could no longer afford the tuition fees. Having to give up his studies to work was the first of many setbacks he would often refer to later in life.\n\nIn 1966 he married Belgian Evi Hock, having met her while working in Germany. In 1979, they divorced. In 1996, Janmaat married Wil Schuurman. No children were born in either marriage.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Janmaat ran a furniture factory with two of his brothers, but it burned down in 1966. He used the insurance payout to study politicology at the University of Amsterdam. Fellow-students found him ambitious, provocative and witty. In 1969, he participated in the occupation of the \"Maagdenhuis\", the university's administrative center, as part of a student protest. He completed his studies in 1972.\n\nAfter graduating, Janmaat held part-time positions as a teacher of civics. He also ran a one-man consultancy for small businesses.\n\nIn 1972, he joined the Catholic People's Party (KVP). He also worked in several commissions for the Democratic Socialists '70 (DS'70) party. Despite his efforts, he was not considered suitable for a front line position because of his capriciousness and tendency to go against the grain.\n\nIn the 1970s, he became more interested in the emerging issue of immigration as large numbers of foreign workers came to the Netherlands. His increasingly radical stance lead to a break with the KVP as well as DS'70.\n\nIn 1980, he read an article in Vrij Nederland which drew his attention to the recently founded extreme-right Centre Party (CP). After several interviews, he joined the party as its seventh member. Starting as a publicity worker, he would rapidly rise to be the party's top and was its \"lijsttrekker\" (top candidate) for the 1982 elections. The party won a single seat in the House of Representatives, which went to Janmaat. Other political parties largely ignored and ostracized him.\n\nAfter disagreements and a power struggle with other members of the Centrum Party, he was expelled from the CP in October 1984. However, he retained his seat in parliament, in accordance with Dutch law. Janmaat officially launched his own party, the Centre Democrats (CD) in November 1984. Politically, the party did not differ greatly from the CP, except that it was strongly centered around Janmaat, to prevent another power struggle.\n\nSeveral attempts were made to reconcile the differences between CP and CD. One such meeting in a hotel in Kedichem was disrupted by left-wing activists, who set fire to the building. Janmaat narrowly escaped with his life, CD secretary (and later wife of Janmaat) Wil Schuurman lost a leg because of injuries sustained jumping out of a window to escape the fire.\n\nIn the 1986 election, Janmaat lost his seat in parliament, however he regained his single seat in 1989.\n\nHis biggest political success would be in the 1994 elections, when he gained three seats. Major political parties changed their response to Janmaat and his views: rather than actively ignoring him they also started openly addressing the issue of immigration. In the 1998 election the CD lost all three of its seats. Janmaat had become increasingly paranoid and said that computers used for voting had been tampered with.\n\nIn 1999, Janmaat was in the process of starting another party, the \"Conservative Democrats\", however it did not get off the ground and did not participate in the 2002 election.\n\nHis failing health forced him to withdraw from politics, however the changing political climate did prompt him to challenge his conviction for discrimination at the European Court of Justice. Janmaat's death in 2002 halted the case.\n\nJanmaat wanted to represent the indigenous Dutch workers and middle class. His views were based mostly on economic and materialistic arguments rather than an underlying ideology. Disappointing economic growth, unemployment and government cutbacks could not be addressed while large numbers of immigrants were flowing into the country. Janmaat was against a multicultural society: he argued that immigrants should either assimilate into Dutch culture, or return to their country of birth.\nHis best known slogans were \"Holland is not a country of immigration,\" \"full=full\" and \"we will abolish the multicultural society, as soon as we get the chance and power\"; he was convicted for the last two statements. According to Jan van de Beek, Hans Janmaat often used economic arguments in his tirades against immigrants.\n\nHe was often accused of committing acts of hate speech, and received fines and a conditional prison sentence for incitement to hatred and discrimination against foreigners.\n\nHe often made controversial remarks about immigrants and other politicians. He argued that Ernst Hirsch Ballin should not be allowed to hold a high office because of his Jewish heritage and said he was not saddened by the sudden death of political opponent Ien Dales.\n\nOther parties erected a cordon sanitaire around Janmaat, ignoring him while he spoke in parliament. A taboo on discussing negative aspects of immigration existed in the Dutch political climate in the 1980s.\n\nMeindert Fennema, Emeritus Professor of Political Theory of Ethnic Relations at the University of Amsterdam, argued in 2006 that Janmaat was convicted for statements that are now commonplace due to changes in the political climate (caused in part by the September 11 attacks, and the assassinations of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh).\n\n"}

Annually, adult and continuing education leaders from around the world are selected for induction into the IACE Hall of Fame.\n\nThe story of the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame officially began in the early 1990s with the desire to provide a mechanism to honor and document contributions of the past to better build the future. Dr. Thurman J. White, a pioneer in the field of continuing education for adult and nontraditional students, contributor to the theoretical base of adult education and initiator of the Oklahoma College of Continuing Education at University of Oklahoma, initiated this idea in cooperation with current leaders and officers of several associations and organizations in the USA (University Continuing Education Association, American Society for Training and Development, AAACE/American Association of Adult and Continuing Education, ECOP/National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges).\n\nThe Hall was incorporated in the state of Oklahoma on September 20, 1995, as a nonprofit corporation. The Hall of Fame, in the beginning focused mostly to the USA, more and more inducted members from other countries. In 2006 the first induction ceremony took place out of the USA (Bamberg, Germany).\nLogo of the society:\nThe Hall of Fame operates with a small central staff in the Office of the Vice President for Outreach at the University of Oklahoma. Inducted members elect a Board of Directors, which manages the induction process and organizes symposia and other Hall activities.\n\nScholars, practitioners, and policy makers reflect the diversity of adult and continuing education practice and scholarship and the increasingly global leadership community that constitutes the IACE Hall of Fame. Anyone may nominate a candidate for induction into the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame. A Selection Committee reviews nominations and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, which selects the final group to be inducted every year. The Nomination Instructions claim: \"To be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame, a person must be eminently distinguished in the profession, shall have brought honor or distinction, and shall have contributed to the heritage of adult and continuing education.\"\n\nSince the first induction in 1996, the Hall of Fame has inducted more than 250 members from 27 nations.\n\nThe official home for the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame is the University of Oklahoma's Oklahoma Center for Continuing Education (OCCE), Norman, Oklahoma.\n\nThe IACE Hall of Fame typically holds its annual induction ceremony and symposium in conjunction with the annual conference of a major national/international professional association in the field: for example in 2008 in Budapest in conjunction with the Unesco/Confintea-conference, in 2010 in Guadalajara with CREAD/Inter-American Distance Education Consortium, and 2011 in Toronto with UPCEA/University Professional & Continuing Education Association.\n"}

Ricketts is married to Marlene Margaret (Volkmer), with whom he has four children, Thomas, Pete, Laura, and Todd, who were raised Roman Catholic. He currently resides in Little Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nIn 1975, John Joseph Ricketts and a few partners formed First Omaha Securities, a retail securities brokerage firm that through mergers and acquisitions grew into TD Ameritrade. Ricketts retired from the TD Ameritrade board in October 2011 to concentrate on entrepreneurship and philanthropy.\n\nIn 2004, John Joseph Ricketts founded High Plains Bison, a retailer of natural bison meat. In addition to online and offline sales channels, High Plains Bison is the official bison vendor at Chicago's Wrigley Field. Some of the bison are raised on a Wyoming ranch owned by Ricketts. A four-bedroom lodge named The Lodge at Jackson Fork Ranch is located on the same property.\n\nIn 2008, John Joseph Ricketts founded The American Film Company, which produces feature films about true stories from American history. \"The Conspirator\" is a 2010 historical drama film directed by Robert Redford. It served as the debut film of The American Film Company.\n\nIn 2009, Joe Ricketts founded DNAinfo.com, a digital news service that used to cover neighborhood news in New York City and Chicago. Ricketts shut it down on November 2, 2017, one week after their employees voted to unionize. Gone with it were Gothamist, Chicagoist, DCist, LAist, SFist, and Shanghaiist. On the 3rd of November, 2017, archived versions of Gothamist, DNAinfo, and other sites were back up. In September 2017, Ricketts explained his actions by stating \"I believe unions promote a corrosive us-against-them dynamic that destroys the esprit de corps businesses need to succeed.\"\n\nIn October 2009, the Ricketts family acquired a 95 percent controlling interest in Major League Baseball's Chicago Cubs and Wrigley Field, as well as 20% of Comcast Sportsnet Chicago. The Ricketts family represents the eighth ownership group in the 133-year history of the team. While Ricketts is not directly involved in the team's operations, his son, Tom Ricketts, is Cubs chairman and his three other children (Pete, Laura and Todd) are on the board of directors. In November 2010, the Cubs announced a plan to seek $200 million in state-backed bonds for renovations to Wrigley Field. The Cubs won the 2016 World Series.\n\nRicketts co-founded the Campaign for Primary Accountability (CPA) with Eric O'Keefe, Leo Linbeck III, and Tim Dunn. It targets both Democratic and Republican incumbents in primary elections.\n\nIn 2010, Ricketts led a campaign against earmarks and what he perceived to be wasteful federal spending. Ricketts founded an independent organization called Taxpayers Against Earmarks that classified every Member of Congress as either a spending \"hero\" or \"hooligan.\"\n\nAlong with Taxpayers for Common Sense and WashingtonWatch.com, Taxpayers Against Earmarks developed a database of earmarks requested by members of Congress. The group successfully pressed for a moratorium on earmarks in 2010. Taxpayers Against Earmarks changed its name to Ending Spending in 2011, as part of a broadening of the group's focus.\n\nRicketts established and funded The Ending Spending Fund, a political action committee, in 2010. The Ending Spending Fund spent over $1 million sponsoring independent advertisements in several Congressional races. The goal of the advertising expenditure was to highlight incumbents' earmark-related policies. The Ending Spending Fund spent the largest amount of its money on the United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010 in an unsuccessful effort to defeat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

Another son, Todd Ricketts, was named CEO of Ending Spending in 2013.\n\nOn May 17, 2012, \"The New York Times\" published a story by Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg reporting that The Ending Spending Action fund had been presented with a 54-page proposal entitled, \"The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: the Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good.\" According to the \"Times\", the proposal, written by a vendor seeking to be hired by Ending Spending, suggested a $10-million ad campaign to \"attack President Obama in ways that Republicans have so far shied away\" and called for \"running commercials linking Mr. Obama to incendiary comments by his former spiritual adviser, the Reverend Jeremiah A. Wright.\" The report came to light when an unidentified person, who was not connected to the proposal, leaked it to \"The New York Times\". The president of the Ending Spending Action Fund said that the pitch was a \"nonstarter\" and issued the following statement repudiating the proposal: \"Not only was this plan merely a proposal—one of several submitted to the Ending Spending Action Fund by third-party vendors—but it reflects an approach to politics that Mr. Ricketts rejects and it was never a plan to be accepted but only a suggestion for a direction to take.\"\n\nAs of mid-2014, the Ending Spending SuperPac had supported only Republicans.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential election, Ricketts donated at least one million dollars in support of Donald Trump.\nRicketts also raised funds for the Future45 Super Pac and the 45Committee, a pro-Trump 501(c)4 organization that is not required to disclose its donors. During the Republican primaries, Ricketts had contributed to Our Principles PAC, a Super PAC dedicated to opposing Trump. Ricketts explained his changed position citing economic grounds, stating that Hillary Clinton \"represents four more years of the Obama-Clinton economic policies that continue to cripple the middle class.\"\n\nJohn Joseph Ricketts established the Opportunity Education Foundation, which underwrites the costs of training teachers and students in the Third World.

Aguillard presented Ricketts and his brother, Jim, with two of three Trustees' Distinguished Service Awards at the annual Founder's Day chapel. \"The little help that we give is really absorbed and used a great deal ... Let me thank you, Louisiana College, for having such an impact on the educational system in the Third World,\" said Joe Ricketts.

While at Rutgers College, he was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity and a member of the freshman football team. After being educated in the United States at Rutgers Preparatory School and Rutgers University, he became president of Kawasaki Shipbuilding Company (\"Kawasaki Shōzō\") in 1896 and then went on to become head of Kawasaki Dockyards from 1916 through 1923.\n\nThe financial success he enjoyed in the early part of the century was affected adversely by economic downturns in the 1920s and 1930s; but much of his art collection remained intact despite the collapse of his business interests.\n\nMasukata invested his significant personal fortune in the acquisition of several thousand examples of Western painting, sculpture and decorative arts. He collected these art works throughout Europe, but primarily in Paris. Mutsukata bought the Rodin masterpiece, \"Gates of Hell\", which is currently to be seen at the Rodin Museum in Paris; and the sculptures on display in the NMWA entrance plaza were made from the same original molds. In the end, he hoped to see his collections in an art museum in Tokyo where visitors could come into direct contact with Western art; and he wanted the people of Tokyo to enjoy the same degree of easy access to great art which was available to Parisians.\n\nMatsukata is also famous for his collection of \"ukiyo-e\" woodblock prints which had been scattered throughout the world. The 1925 exhibition of the woodblock prints Mtsukata collected abroad is thought to have been the first of its kind in Japan. Today about 8,000 ukiyo-e prints from the Matsukata collection are housed in the Tokyo National Museum.\n\nAmong these works collected by Matsukata, those known today as the NMWA Matsukata Collection remained in France after World War II; and as part of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, they were briefly confiscated by France. Although most were sent to Japan, 14 valuable paintings by Monet, Van Gogh, Courbet, Cézanne, and others were retained to fill in gaps in the French national collection. The remaining objects in the Matsukata collection totaled 370 works, including 196 paintings, 80 drawings, 26 prints and 63 sculptures—including massive public statuary by Rodin which now grace the landscaped area in front of the entrance to NMWA. Each of the Rodin sculptures in the NMWA collection were cast from the original molds. In fact, as it happens, Matsukata was the one who paid for the best Rodin castings in France today, but he didn't quite manage to bring them back to Japan, which is how they fell into French hands at the end of World War II. The Matsukata Collection is in Tokyo today because France eventually gave these artworks to the Japanese people.\n\nMatsukata was well known as a good friend of Claude Monet. It has been reported that once, when Monet offered him the opportunity to buy whatever he wanted in the studio at Giverny, he purchased 18 paintings. His other artist friends included Frank Brangwyn, who assisted Matsukata in the acquisition of his collection. Brangwyn designed a gallery, the so-called Palace of Sheer Pleasure, which Matsukata intended to build in Tokyo.\n\nHe had originally intended to bring all these artworks to Japan, but he balked at the 100% tax imposed on imports. Much of what was stored in Britain was destroyed by fires during World War II; and much of what remained in Japan was also destroyed by Allied bombing during the Pacific War. The combination of factors which kept so much of his collecting activities intact was only seen by the Japanese public for the first time in 1959 when they visited the museum he had envisaged.\n\n\n"}

She appointed attorney Haitham Tarshishi to file a lawsuit against \"all those involved in the forgery of a picture attributed to her through social media sites, accompanied by words beyond the limits of fitness.\" In August 2016 the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation reported that a suspect had been arrested.\n\nIn April 2017 as a guest on the LBCI satirical program \"La-hon Wa-bas\" hosted by Hicham Haddad, Abboud condemned an issue of \"Nadine Magazine\" for its depiction of her chest and face shape with the words, \"Bigger than this chest\" emblazoned on its cover, based on her quote while she used Arabic word of ṣadr which can be an invocation for conscience and heart. She accused the magazine of trying to increase readership by dumbing down and oversimplifying its content. Earlier in Jun 26, 2017 strongly criticized yellow-pens of Lebanese music journalists.\n\nMoved to Beirut in 2009. Abboud cares about her physical health and elegance. In June 2017 she publicly confirmed that she had undergone rhinoplasty, but that the rest of her features were not the result of plastic surgery, stating, \"The secret of my beauty is sport\". She is an advocate for a public smoking ban for Lebanon, saying, \"Smoking and non-smoking areas must be allocated\".

{"id": "1571884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1571884", "title": "Michael Ashcroft", "text": "Michael Ashcroft\n\nMichael Anthony P. Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft, (born 4 March 1946) is a British-Belizean businessman and politician. He is a former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. Ashcroft founded Michael A. Ashcroft Associates in 1972 and is the 95th richest person in the UK, as ranked by the \"Sunday Times\" Rich List 2017, with an estimated fortune of £1.35 billion.\n\nHe sat on the Conservative benches of the House of Lords until 2015, having been created a life peer in 2000. His peerage was controversial due to his status as a tax exile. The Cabinet Office stated that he would take up permanent residence in the UK for tax purposes, but it was reported a decade later that he had not done so.\n\nAshcroft holds dual British and Belizean nationality, and is a belonger of the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nBorn in Chichester, West Sussex, as his father Eric was a British colonial civil servant, Ashcroft spent some of his early years in British Honduras (now Belize) and Malawi.\n\nHe was educated at Norwich School, Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, and Mid-Essex Technical College (now Anglia Ruskin University), where he obtained a Higher National Diploma in Business studies.\n\nAfter a period in Belize after completing his education, Ashcroft returned to hitch hike around Europe, and then for a short period of time became the manager of a rock and roll band. In 1967, Ashcroft joined Carreras Tobacco as a management trainee.\n\nHe left in 1969, joining Pritchard Group Services, after several months unemployed. Pritchard Group was a cleaning and business services company and Ashcroft worked his way up quickly to become an assistant in the company's head office accounting department, part of a large acquisitions team.\n\nIn 1972, at the age of 26, he started his own business, Michael A. Ashcroft Associates. His first acquisition was Uni-Kleen – a loss-making cleaning company with one thousand employees, which he purchased for just £1 in 1974, with a £15,000 bank loan (or £176,780 in 2014-inflation adjusted terms). He worked to turn the company around, selling it just three years later for £1.3 million.\n\nOn exiting Uni-Kleen in 1977, his next purchase was Hawley Goodall, another poorly performing company, this time in camping equipment manufacture. Ashcroft used Hawley to make a series of acquisitions, transforming Hawley into a business services group, ranging from janitorial services for hospitals and offices, to car auction services, and later with a focus on the security services industry. Through the sale of the car auctions division to the fast-expanding British Car Auctions, he formed a lifelong friendship with David Wickins, whom he would later help take a majority stake in Lotus Cars, as well as finance other joint-ventures. By 1981, Hawley had made its first acquisitions in the United States, and its total revenues had grown to $27 million.\n\nBy early 1983, Hawley had built up a 20% stake in pharmaceutical packaging manufacturer Cope Allman. Ashcroft offered to increase his stake to 29.9%, just below the 30% level at which a formal bid for the entire company must be launched. Ashcroft and Cope Allman fought bitterly over the purchase share price and current holdings, with Cope Allman reporting Ashcroft and Wickins to the Takeover panel, after discovering that BCA had built up a 13.5% in the company. But the takeover panel found that the Ashcroft and Wickins were operating independently, so Hawley was able to increase its holding to 29.9%. At this point the combined holdings of Hawley/BCA in Cope Allman amounted to 43.5% per cent of Cope Allman, giving them the power to introduce sweeping changes without launching a full bid. Cope Allman was eventually sold to an MBO backed by Hawley and financed by Bain Capital, and then sold to Bowater in 1992 in a complex swap of assets with ADT/Hawley.\n\nIn 1985 Ashcroft and Wickins bought car sales dealership Henlys Group via a Canadian-registered company, Mipec. Controlled by Ashcroft's Hawley Goodall, Henlys was merged with the already owned funeral hearse maker Coleman Milne to form a Motoring Division. In 1989, Hawley Goodall sold its Motoring Division consisting of Henlys and Coleman Milne to the Plaxton Group, the bus and coach manufacturer based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.\n\nIn 1986, Hawley bought out Ashcroft's former employer, Pritchard Services, leaping to the second place in the U.S. services industry. At this time, Hawley had revenues of more than $1.3 billion.\n\n1987 was a key year for Hawley. In the early part of the year, it bought Crime Control Inc. based in Indianapolis, for $50 million, placing the company in fourth place in the U.S. security market. Later in the year it bought ADT Security Services, the largest electronic security company in the United States. This purchase transformed Hawley into the leading security services business in the United States, and resulted in the majority of its revenues coming from the North American market. As a result of the acquisition, Bermuda-registered Hawley changed its name to ADT Inc. and decided to refocus its business around security services. At the end of 1987, the company sold its North American-based facility services business to Denmark's ISS A/S.\n\nIn 1987, Ashcroft bought out the existing shareholders of Wickins BCA via Hawley Goodall. Based at Blackbushe Airport to allow Wickins access to his treasured aviation division, which flew both Jet Ranger helicopters and Beechcraft King Air turbo prop aircraft, Ashcroft, who has a disliking for such flippant expenditure, immediately sold off the aircraft. Wickins joined the board of Hawley Goodall, remaining there until the Tyco takeover, but retired from BCA in 1990. In 1995, to allow for the Tyco transaction, the group decided to divest itself of BCA. The residual North American arm was sold to trade buyers, while the European arm was sold to a consortium of some 40 private investors, including Ashcroft via his Belize-based investment company. In September 2006, BCA was bought by the UK-based investment banking arm of private bank Samuel Montagu & Co., a division of HSBC, personally netting Ashcroft over £200 million.\n\nIn 1997, ADT was sold by a reverse takeover to US conglomerate Tyco International for $6.7 billion, allowing Tyco to become tax-efficient.\n\nAshcroft disposed of large amounts of the Tyco stock which he had acquired as a result of the sale of ADT, explaining that he needed the capital to diversify into other things and that he never retained a substantial stake in any enterprise which he did not control. Ashcroft nevertheless continued as a non-executive director of Tyco, a role he still held in 2002 when Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski was arrested in New York in connection with personal tax offences. Unease had already been expressed at Tyco at some of Kozlowski's corporate decisions and Ashcroft was amongst the directors who appointed lawyer David Boies to investigate irregularities in the company. In time, the exposure of management deficiencies led to Ashcroft's demanding that the whole of the board of directors of Tyco should resign, to be replaced by new management.\n\nAshcroft has close business and other connections with the Commonwealth country of Belize, and served as the country's ambassador to the United Nations between 1998 and 2000. In his 2005 biography, he admitted that it is a country where his interests have been \"exempt from certain taxes for 30 years.\" In 2009, the Prime Minister of Belize Dean Barrow told its parliament:\n\nBarrow also warned David Cameron that relations with the United Kingdom would be damaged if Ashcroft were given a senior position in government.\nIn 1981, Belize had gained independence from the UK. Seeing the opportunity to build an off-shore operations base and control the country's financial service, in 1984 Ashcroft formed Belize Holdings (BHI), which became the vehicle for a parallel acquisition spree during the 1980s, beyond the scope of Hawley.\n\nBy the late 1980s, BHI had become one of the largest holding companies in Belize, with direct interests in or holdings via main operating company Stargate Ltd, ranging from telecommunications, property, the Belize shipping register, and citrus fruits.\n\nIn 1987, BHI led the formation of Belize Bank Holdings (BBH), which took control of Belize Bank from the Royal Bank of Canada. Belize Bank has become the country's largest financial institution, controlling some 50 percent of the market. BBH developed local and international interests in facilities services, finance and telecommunications. Belize Bank itself formerly held a majority stake in Belize Telemedia Limited (BTL), until it was nationalised by the Government of Belize.\n\nIn 2005, under pressure from the Belize Government to bring transparency to its Belize based financial interests, BBH restructured, demerging its interests in England and Ireland into a separate company, Carlisle Group Ltd. BBH then renamed itself BCB Holdings.\n\nAshcroft also has significant interests in the following companies quoted on the Alternative Investment Market: Restore plc, WeAre20:20 and Impellam Group.\n\nHaving attempted a takeover Corporate Services Group in 1999, in June 2006 he increased his stake to 28.5%, prompting speculation that he might make an offer for the remaining shares in the company. In May 2008 the merger of Carlisle Group and Corporate Services Group to form Impellam Group was announced. Listed on the Alternative Investment Market, the combined group places in excess of 40,000 people into work each week.\n\nIn September 2007, Ashcroft agreed the sale of AIM listed cleaning services supplier OneSource. Based mainly in the United States, it was the old North American cleaning business of ISS that Ashcroft had sold to them when refocusing Hawley in 1987. Bought in 1997 for $1, he agreed the sale of the company at a value of £179m.\n\nAs of March 2006 he became the major shareholder in English professional football club Watford, owning up to 42% of the club's shares. In September 2006, he accepted a bid for British Car Auctions (BCA) worth £450m, netting him a personal gain of £200m.\n\nIn 2011, he became the main backer, along with Stephan Shakespeare (CEO and co-Founder of YouGov) of Flooved, an online education startup.\n\nIn April 1972, Ashcroft married Wendy Burrell in Hampstead, north London. They had two sons and one daughter. His second marriage in 1986 was to Susan Anstey. The couple have homes in London, Maidenhead in Berkshire, and Belize.\n\nAshcroft owns a Dassault Falcon 7X, registration VP-BZE, via his Bermudian registered company, Flying Lion. On 27 December 2017, while parked at the Malta International Airport, the plane careened off the apron, smashed into a fence and a road before crashing into an office building. The incident is believed to have occurred after the plane's wheel chocks were blown away due to strong winds. No injuries were reported but the plane suffered extensive damage.\n\nHe owns two yachts, both registered in Belize:\n\nIn the UK, he was a major donor to and Treasurer of the Conservative Party from 1998 to 2001, under William Hague. His tenure was marked by a number of controversies: he was seen to pay little UK income tax because of his domicile in Belize; and he was at the centre of a debate about openness and accountability of political funding. Unsubstantiated speculation about his business affairs was concluded when he pursued a libel action against \"The Times\". This was settled on 9 December 1999, when \"The Times\" issued a front-page statement saying \"The Times is pleased to confirm that it has no evidence that Mr Ashcroft or any of his companies have ever been suspected of money-laundering or drug-related crimes... Litigation between the parties has been settled to mutual satisfaction, with each side bearing its own costs.\"\n\nIn 2004, he clashed with Conservative leader Michael Howard when he offered a £2m donation on the condition that it should go to his specified candidates rather than into general Conservative Central Office funds. Ashcroft stated in 2005: \"I much prefer to be involved, to make sure that my investment is wisely placed.\"\n\nIn December 2005, he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party.\n\nDuring the \"Cash for Peerages\" controversy, on 31 March 2006 Ashcroft was named by the Conservative Party as having loaned it £3.6m.\n\nOn 12 October 2007 he was accused by Labour MPs of being allowed to heavily fund local Conservative organisations in marginal seats of his choosing. Ashcroft has insisted such funding is legitimate.\n\nSignificant donations made to the Conservative Party by Bearwood Corporate Services, a company controlled by Ashcroft, have also come under scrutiny. The trading status of the company, and thus the validity of donations totalling £5.1m between 2003 and 2008, is unclear and became the subject of an investigation by the Electoral Commission begun in October 2008. Both Labour MPs and the Prime Minister had called for the process to be concluded in time for the next general election, due by mid-2010. Liberal Democrat Lord Oakeshott stated: \"Democracy is in danger if Lord Ashcroft has been pouring millions into Conservative campaigns through an offshore pipeline from a Caribbean tax haven.\" However, in March 2010 sources from the Electoral Commission described the donations as being \"legal and permissible\".\n\nOn 1 March 2010, Ashcroft admitted that he was not domiciled in the UK for tax purposes. On 4 March 2010 the House of Commons Public Administration Select committee decided to hold a \"special one-off inquiry\" into Ashcroft's peerage and his tax affairs. The committee's three Conservative MPs are said to have refused to take part in the inquiry.\n\nIn September 2010, Ashcroft announced he would be stepping down as Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party. His resignation came as he published Minority Verdict, his critical analysis of why the Conservative Party failed to gain an overall majority in the general election; leading to the Conservatives forming the Coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. He was replaced by the Conservative MP, former government minister and the current Treasury Select Committee member, Michael Fallon.\n\nIn 2012, the \"Daily Telegraph\" credited Ashcroft, owner of both the ConservativeHome and PoliticsHome website with\n\"stopping the Coalition working\" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education, taxation to the right. Prior to the 2010 election, Cameron gave Ashcroft a large office and a significant role in the election campaign but he received no reward in the form of ministerial job.\nAlthough claiming not to exercise editorial control, Ashcroft, a \"brutal critic of the Coalition from the start\"\nhas established \"megaphone presence\" in the online media and the Lib Dems are described as blocking economic and welfare system reforms. The parties have separate and contradictory agendas and--as exemplified by Michael Gove's education reforms intended for Tory ears only'-do not even consult each other.\nCameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by \"coordinated attacks on the Coalition.\" Although voters may have liked Coalition government, \"the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together\" and Cameron seems unwilling to celebrate midterm successes. \"Ashcroft, who has been against it all along, looks like getting his way.\"\n\nAshcroft allegedly gave the People's United Party in Belize $1m when it was in opposition. During its period in power, it introduced laws that are claimed by opponents and media commentators to be financially advantageous to Ashcroft.\n\nAshcroft has become a significant figure in Australian politics having been identified as the single largest individual donor to any Australian political party during the Financial Year 2004/2005. The Australian Electoral Commission reported in February 2006 that Ashcroft (who gave his address as \"House of Lords, Westminster, London\") had donated $1 million to the Liberal Party in September 2004 just before the 2004 Federal election. It was the biggest single disclosed private donation in Australian political history. He also donated $250,000 to the Liberal Party on 28 July 2010.\n\nDeveloping from work he did for the Conservative Party in his Deputy Chairman role, since 2010 Lord Ashcroft has been a major independent public pollster of British political opinion. This has included polling at constituency level, which is rare in British psephology. Lord Ashcroft Polls' results are freely available online and are frequently discussed in various media outlets.\n\nIn 2013, Ashcroft stated that he has given tens of millions of pounds to good causes over the years. In May 2013, he pledged to donate more than half of his money to good causes, and became a signatory of The Giving Pledge.\n\nLord Ashcroft is the founder and chairman of Crimestoppers.\n\nOn 12 October 2009, Lord Ashcroft pledged NZ$50,000 for the safe return of two-year-old toddler Aisling Symes. Aisling had gone missing a week earlier in West Auckland.\n\nAshcroft has been Chancellor of Anglia Ruskin University since November 2001. He donated £5 million in 1999 for the university's business school at Chelmsford, now called Lord Ashcroft International Business School, and another £5million gift in 2009 to create a new business school in Cambridge.\n\nHe is the sponsor of Ashcroft Technology Academy in Wandsworth, a state secondary school within the English academy programme.\n\nHe became the main backer, along with Stephan Shakespeare (CEO and co-Founder of YouGov) of Flooved, an Ed tech Startup.\n\nHe has provided a copy of \"Britain's Treasure Islands\" to every secondary school in the UK and its overseas territories.\n\nAshcroft is also an Ambassador for the education and veterans charity SkillForce which, under Chief Executive, Ben Slade devised and developed the Prince William Award - the only award of its kind in William's name.\n\nAshcroft is a whale spotter, through which interest he has financially supported various environmental groups and campaigns. He financially supported the Environmental Investigation Agency, who persuaded him to back a television campaign in six Caribbean countries, aimed at coaxing them to withdraw their support for whaling. The countries had received $16 million (£8 million) a year in fisheries aid from Japan. The campaign coincided with the 2006 International Whaling Commission conference in St Kitts.\n\nAshcroft has also supported military causes; in September 2011 he hosted a reception at the House of Lords for the launch of the Felix Fund, the charity for bomb disposal experts and their families.\n\nAshcroft pledged to donate all of the author's royalties from his book \"Special Forces Heroes\" to the Help for Heroes charity, and from his book, \"George Cross Heroes\" to the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association.\n\nHe donated £1 million of the £7 million cost of the Bomber Command Memorial in London's Green Park, and his contribution is recognised on each side of the memorial.\n\nAshcroft collects Victoria Crosses which are awarded for valour and devotion to duty to members of various armed forces. His collection is by far the largest in the world spanning 128 years from acts of valour at the start of the Crimean War in 1854 to an act of courage during the Falklands War in 1982. He wrote \"Victoria Cross Heroes\", to mark the 150th anniversary of the Victoria Cross.\n\nFollowing the theft of a number of Victoria Crosses awarded to New Zealand servicemen from the Army Museum at Waiouru in late 2007, Ashcroft pledged NZ$200,000 for their return. Those stolen included the VC & Bar of Charles Upham. The medals were recovered three months later and at a presentation in Wellington on 15 April 2008 he pledged a further NZ$200,000 for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the thefts.\n\nIn July 2008, Ashcroft announced a donation of £5 million for a permanent gallery at the Imperial War Museum, where the fifty Victoria Crosses held by the museum are now on display alongside his own collection of 162 VCs.\n\nAshcroft has been described as a \"tax exile\", and for a number of years lived in the UK enjoying the controversial non-domiciled tax status. At the time of his ennoblement the Cabinet Office said that Ashcroft would be taking up permanent residence in the UK for tax purposes, an undertaking described in the newspapers as a \"pledge\" and a \"gentleman's agreement\", but he did not in fact claim to do so until a decade later, when a change in the law would have required him to quit the Lords, had he not done so. Then in 2017 it was revealed following the Paradise Papers leak of offshore investment documents that Lord Ashcroft remained a domicile of Belize despite having claimed to have given up his non-dom tax status in 2010.\n\nIn 1999, Ashcroft was first nominated by Conservative Party leader and friend William Hague for the Lords. During their investigation, the House of Lords Appointments Commission was fed certain information via the media, which originated from Jonathan Randel, an intelligence research specialist for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nRandel leaked Ashcroft's name as being in the DEA's files, although it later emerged that Ashcroft was one of five million people they routinely had files on. Randel claimed that the DEA was ignoring Ashcroft in its investigation of money laundering, allegations which \"The Times\" newspaper later printed on its front page. However, later investigation by various British media sources from information released under the US Freedom of Information Act showed that at no point did the DEA personally investigate Ashcroft.\n\nAfter his second successful nomination to the Lords and his ascent to the house, Ashcroft sued \"The Times\" in the High Court. The two parties eventually reached an out of court agreement which resulted in Rupert Murdoch agreeing to \"The Times\" printing a full front page retraction of its allegations. Ashcroft later recounted his own side of the story in his book, \"Dirty Politics, Dirty Times.\"\n\nIn 2003, Ashcroft was criticised by the High Court judge, Mr Justice Peter Smith in \"Rock (Nominees) Ltd v RCO (Holdings) Plc\". Smith condemned Ashcroft's tactics in relation to the takeover of cleaning company RCO by the Danish firm ISS. Smith said,\n\nSmith went on to say that Ashcroft \"was not content with a small £250,000 profit earned in a matter of weeks. He now seeks to extract millions.\" Ashcroft responded by telling journalists that \"being accused of blackmail by a man who states that speculation has no part to play in the City is rather like finding that you are sharing a railway carriage with a drunk. It's best not to take too much notice.\"\n\nIn 2008, \"The Economist\" ran an article on the web of loans and court cases surrounding Belize Bank (owned by Ashcroft), a private hospital company called Universal Health Services and the government of Belize. It was alleged that Belize Bank had wrongly appropriated monies sent from the government of Venezuela for housing purposes in order to settle debts relating to loans to UHS and illegally guaranteed in secret by the Belizean premier.\n\nOn 5 March 2010, Ashcroft was accused of avoiding VAT on opinion polls he commissioned for the Conservatives in 2005. The polls were carried out by YouGov and Populus, and are believed to have cost in the region of £250,000.\n\n\"The Guardian\" said that sources claimed the bills were paid by a company owned by Ashcroft in Belize, meaning that he did not pay VAT. The newspaper estimated that the total VAT bill could have totalled more than £40,000, however, paying the bill in this way removed the legal obligation to pay VAT.\n\nIn 2012, BBC's \"Panorama\" programme alleged that Lord Ashcroft continued to control the Caribbean construction company, Johnston International, after its sale in 1999 until it went bankrupt in 2010, and that he concealed his continuing control. Ashcroft denied he owned Johnston after 1999 but ignored questions about whether he continued to 'control' it.\n\nAshcroft's book \"Call Me Dave: The unauthorised biography of David Cameron\", published on 5 October 2015, has been criticised for containing content which lacks evidence. In addition to this, some commentators believe Ashcroft published the book to tarnish David Cameron's reputation. The book triggered the \"Piggate\" scandal with an allegation that a photograph exists which shows Cameron putting \"a private part of his anatomy\" into the mouth of a dead pig's severed head, which was positioned in the lap of another man.\n\nOn 31 March 2000, Ashcroft was appointed as a life peer, and the title Baron Ashcroft, of Chichester in the County of West Sussex was gazetted on 20 October 2000. His appointment to the House of Lords was controversial at the time, particularly because of his business and political interests in Belize; the body responsible for scrutiny of political honours had refused his becoming a member of the Lords one year earlier.\n\nHe was nominated by Conservative party leader William Hague on the condition that he became a UK resident although at the beginning of 2010 he announced his \"non-domiciled\" tax status. Ashcroft had announced that he intended to take the title \"Baron Ashcroft of Belize\", a suggestion that infuriated his political opponents. He later said this had been a joke, and his title was created as simply \"Baron Ashcroft\".\n\nIn the 2000 Queen's Birthday Honours, on the advice of the Belizean government, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) \"for public service to the community and country\" of Belize.\n\nIn 1999, he was given the Honorary Degree of Doctor of the University by Anglia Ruskin University, he would be named Chancellor of the University in 2001.\n\nHe was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2012, entitling him to use the post-nominal letters \"PC\" for life.\n\nOn 31 March 2015, the day after the prorogation of Parliament ahead of the 2015 general election, he announced his resignation from the House of Lords with immediate effect, stating he would continue in politics.\n\n\n\n"}

OGS works in partnership with the Heller School for Social Policy and Management (Brandeis University) and MassChallenge to give OGS Fellows the tools to develop businesses that generate significant social and economic value in the Middle East.\n\nOGS teaches business development, financial management, marketing strategy, and conflict-resolution to young adults aged 21–30. The fellowship runs over the course of three months in Waltham, Massachusetts and includes daily classes taught by Brandeis University professors, one-on-one mentoring, and workshops. During the summer, the fellows work in teams to build sustainable businesses that will benefit their home communities. The fellowship operates entirely in English and provides each group of fellows with the skills and network to enact change in their communities. Each business developed through OGS receives seed funding at the end of the fellowship to aid in their launch and operations upon return to Israel and Palestine.\n\nOGS Fellows remain connected through the OGS Alumni Organization, which plans a number of annual activities, including group trips in Israel and Palestine, meetings with local leaders, and trainings focused on career and leadership development. The organization will host an annual conference for current fellowship participants and the growing group of alumni over time.\n\nThe OGS Fellows are exceptional young adults from both Israel and Palestine. OGS uses entrepreneurship to bring together people from these communities, which in turn works toward building trust and enacting social and economic change. Each year, OGS aims to maintain a 1:1 ratio of Israeli and Palestinians, as well as female and male fellows.\n\nThe fellowship is fully funded for the fellows.\n\nOur Gеnеrаtіоn Speaks wаѕ fоundеd by Brandeis University student Ohad Elhelo in 2014.

He is chair of NantWorks, LLC, executive director of the Wireless Health Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles, and an adjunct professor of surgery at UCLA. He is chair of the Chan Soon-Shiong Family Foundation, and chair and CEO of the Chan Soon-Shiong Institute for Advanced Health, National LambdaRail, and the Healthcare Transformation Institute. Soon-Shiong has been a minority owner of the Los Angeles Lakers since 2010. Since 2018, he has been the owner of the \"Los Angeles Times\" and \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\". In April 2016, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported him to be one of the highest-paid CEOs for 2015. , Soon-Shiong was estimated by \"Forbes\" as having a net worth of 9 billion, ranking him #47 among US billionaires. As of December 2016, he has 92 US and 138 international patents.\n\nSoon-Shiong was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa to Chinese immigrant parents who fled from China during the Japanese occupation in World War II. His parents were originally from Toisan in Guangdong province and of the Hakka people and language group. His ancestral surname is Wong (Huang 黃).\n\nSoon-Shiong graduated 4th out of his class of 189 from the University of Witwatersrand, receiving a bachelor's degree in medicine (MBBCh) at age 23. He completed his medical internship at Johannesburg's General Hospital. He then studied at the University of British Columbia, where he earned a master's degree in 1979, with research awards from the American College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the American Association of Academic Surgery.\n\nHe moved to the United States and began surgical training at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and became a board-certified surgeon in 1984. Soon-Shiong is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Canada) and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons.\n\nSoon-Shiong joined UCLA Medical School in 1983 and served on that faculty until 1991, as a transplant surgeon. Between 1984 and 1987, he served as an associate investigator at the Center for Ulcer Research and Education. Soon-Shiong performed the first whole-pancreas transplant done at UCLA, and he developed and first performed the experimental Type 1 diabetes-treatment known as encapsulated-human-islet transplant, and the \"first pig-to-man islet-cell transplant in diabetic patients.\" After a period in industry, he returned to UCLA in 2009, serving as a professor of microbiology, immunology, molecular genetics and bioengineering until this date. Soon-Shiong served as a visiting professor at Imperial College, London in 2011.\n\nIn 1991, Soon-Shiong left UCLA to start a diabetes and cancer biotechnology firm. This led to the founding in 1997 of APP Pharmaceuticals, of which he held 80% of outstanding stock and sold to Fresenius SE for $4.6 billion in July 2008. Soon-Shiong later founded Abraxis BioScience (maker of the drug Abraxane he co-discovered), a company he sold to Celgene in 2010 in cash-and-stock deal, valued at over $3 billion.\n\nSoon-Shiong founded NantHealth in 2007 to provide fiber-optic, cloud-based data infrastructure to share healthcare information. Soon-Shiong went on to found NantWorks in September 2011, whose mission was \"to converge ultra-low power semiconductor technology, supercomputing, high performance, secure advanced networks and augmented intelligence to transform how we work, play, and live.\" In October 2012, Soon-Shiong announced that NantHealth's supercomputer-based system and network were able to analyze the genetic data from a tumor sample in 47 seconds and transfer the data in 18 seconds. The goal of developing this infrastructure and digital technologies was to share genomic information among sequencing centers, medical research hubs and hospitals, and to advance cancer research and big science endeavors such as The Cancer Genome Atlas. In January 2013, he founded another biotech company, NantOmics, to develop cancer drugs based on protein kinase inhibitors. NantOmics and its sister company, NantHealth, were subsidiaries of NantWorks. Soon-Shiong stated that NantWorks' vision for the future of cancer treatment was a convergence of multiple technologies that included diagnostics, supercomputing, network modeling of sharing data on tumor genes and personalized cocktails of cancer drugs in multi-target attacks, to achieve a sustained disease-free state.\n\nIn 2010, with Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, Soon-Shiong founded the Healthcare Transformation Institute (HTI), which he dubs a \"do-tank\". HTI's mission is to promote a paradigm shift in health care in the United States by better integrating the three now separate domains of medical science, health delivery, and healthcare finance. In 2014, Soon-Shiong funded online streaming music service AccuRadio, investing $2.5 million into the first round of funding for America's fastest-growing music webcaster.\n\nIn 2014 Soon-Shiong made a $12 million donation to the University of Utah. An audit three years later found several legal violations. As part of the donation, the university was required to use Soon-Shiong's company for the services required for the research, at a total cost of $10 million. NantHealth set the price for DNA sequencing at $10,000 per sample, while auditors found that other companies charged between $2,900 and $5,000 for the same service. Legal experts referred to it as money laundering, or perhaps a technique to receive tax deductions for an investment in Soon-Shiong's own company.\n\nIn early 2016, Soon-Shiong launched the National Immunotherapy Coalition to encourage rival pharmaceutical companies to work together to test combinations of cancer-fighting drugs. He has also met numerous times with former Vice President Joe Biden to discuss more ambitious approaches to fighting cancer, including conducting genomic sequencing of 100,000 patients to create a massive database of potential genetic factors.\n\nIn early January 2017, as announced by Sean Spicer, then President-elect Donald Trump met with Soon-Shiong at his Bedminster, NJ estate to discuss national medical priorities.\n\nIn February 2018, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Soon-Shiong's investment firm Nant Capital reached a deal to purchase the paper and \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" from Tronc Inc. for \"nearly $500 million in cash\" as well as the assumption of $90 million in pension obligations. Soon-Shiong, with this acquisition became one of the first Asian-Americans to become a media proprietor through ownership in a major daily newspaper in the United States. The sale closed on June 18, 2018.\n\nIn September 2018, his company NantEnergy announced the development of a zinc air battery with a projected cost of $100 per kilowatt-hour (less than one-third the cost of lithium-ion batteries).\n\nHe is married to Michele B. Chan, lives in Los Angeles, California, and has two children, daughter Nika and son Luke.\n"}

It leads to cost savings, increased efficiency and a more satisfied work force.\n\nAlpha is a word used in the investment process. A positive alpha means that a fund has performed better than the benchmark or better than average.\n\nThere is a direct correlation between a firm’s operations and productivity. When operations are automated and operational processes are streamlined, productivity increases. This can help a firm to see a significant improvement in their overall business. Well-run operations will, in fact:\n\n\nBy allowing the asset manager to execute his or her investment strategy faster or smarter, the operations can have a direct impact on the fund’s alpha.\n\nHighly automated and efficient operations enable a firm to more quickly accommodate new instruments, strategies and markets, thus directly contributing to the development of new sources of alpha.\n\nBy avoiding errors and delays in operations the COO helps to protect the alpha that the fund manager has created. \nErrors in the middle or back office can result in additional costs for reversing trades or even penalties. Furthermore, inadequate technology can increase an organization’s risk exposure. Operations which are tightly and efficiently managed can contribute to the protection of investment alpha.\n\nBy being more efficient in operations, an organization can reduce the cost of operations, directly benefitting the fund or the asset manager’s P&L.\nEvery dollar spent on administrative expenses is a dollar less in additional revenue performance. In order to create and protect alpha, you must be able to reduce expenses and streamline processes.\n\nBy leveraging efficient operations for enhanced client service and reporting, an organization can spend more productive time with its clients. \nInvestors today demand accurate and well-presented information in a timely manner. This requires that operational processes and systems be aligned and skillfully managed to successfully feed downstream reporting applications and produce credible investor reports. Clearer reporting and increased transparency enables a higher quality and more satisfying client interactions, and directly contributes to the productivity of client-facing staff in both the front and back office.\n\nTechnology is essential in helping to optimize operations and increase productivity. The strategic deployment of technology allows investment firms to manage complexity, increase efficiency, and reduce costs and operational risk. Technology also enables investment firms to respond to changing business and regulatory requirements such as Dodd-Frank Act, UCITS and MiFID.

{"id": "8722818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8722818", "title": "Pullman Square", "text": "Pullman Square\n\nPullman Square is a lifestyle center in downtown Huntington, West Virginia, United States between 8th and 10th Street and 3rd Avenue and Veteran's Memorial Boulevard. It is located on what was known as the Superblock, a large urban renewal project that saw the demolishing of four city-square-blocks in 1970.\n\nThe Superblock was to be a large revitalizaion project in downtown Huntington. In 1970, a four-block vacant site was created for the next \"large development\"; however, problems besieged the area for decades. In 1974, a master plan was developed for the vacant site.\n\nIn 1977, the Huntington Civic Arena was constructed on one parcel. One year later, a group of entrepreneurs wanted to construct a 350-room hotel and retail stores; however, the plan died by 1980. In 1983, the \"National Shamrock Development and Investment Company\" wanted to develop the property and took a two-year lease on the project. By mid-1985, however, the lease ran out and the developers could not receive financial backing due to the failure in their $15 million \"Urban Development Action Grant\" request.\n\nIn the spring of 1986, the \"Huntington Development Corporation\" suggested that an off-track betting facility be constructed; however, the idea died after Governor Arch Moore vetoed an off-track betting bill that was critical to the project's success. In 1987, the \"Webb Companies\" presented a plan for a $110 million mixed-use complex called RiverCenter that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground parking garage and a skyway to the Harris Riverfront Park. The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.\n\nAnother instance included an outlet mall proposal that was announced on May 6, 1987; however, two months later, the Herald-Dispatch reported that the project was \"dead\" and that the \"13-year history of failure haunts (the) Superblock.\" Another proposal, on April 28, 1989 reported on a development that was \"on tap,\" followed by an article several years later that stated, \"super development dream fails to become reality.\" In 1992, a two-story shopping center was proposed but the idea failed to receive tenant support.\n\nA Chi-Chi's Mexican restaurant was constructed on the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street in 1991. These developments were mostly suburban in nature and was not conductive to improvements in downtown Huntington. A Holiday Inn was constructed adjacent to the Big Sandy Superstore Arena between 8th and 9th Street in 1998.\n\nIn 1998, $27 million for an intermodal facility was appropriated from Congress; an additional $6.7 million came from state and local funding. Then Governor Cecil Underwood had promised $700,000 in 1999, with local lawmakers funding the additional $1.3 million; an additional $4 million was to be allocated from the state over the next two years.\n\nThe proposed facility was for a Tri-State Transit Authority (TTA) bus transfer station, retail development and associated parking structures and would occupy a two-block surface parking lot between 8th Street and 10th Street along 3rd Avenue. A later study by \"Woolpert\" suggested at least of retail and a parking structure that has 800 to 1,400 spaces. Yet another study suggested that retail, entertainment, dining, housing, cultural, and educational aspects be included in the project. A ground breaking ceremony was planned in early 2000 with initial completion of the project in 2001.\n\nIn order to complete the \"Superblock\", Chi-Chi's would need to be evicted; however, it was granted and opportunity to have a restaurant within the proposed development. Chi-Chi's refused to leave the \"Superblock\", however, citing that they wanted to \"upgrade and remodel\" the restaurant.\n\nIn 1999, Robert C. Byrd allocated $8 million to federal appropriation bills for the \"Superblock\" project. Another $400,000 was allocated from the Federal Transit Administration to the \"Huntington Transit Authority\" for the feasibility study and master plan for the intermodal facility.\n\nOn September 30, 1999, it was announced that the \"Huntington Urban Renewal Authority\" was in negotiations with the \"Transit Authority\" and an unnamed Columbus, Ohio developer for the Superblock. In early October, President Bill Clinton signed the \"Transportation Appropriations\" bill, which provided an additional $12 million in funds for the intermodal facility.\n\nOn October 18, 2000, \"Steiner + Associates\" (dropped in favor of \"Metropolitan Partners\" with the same developers), a Columbus, Ohio developer that specializes in recreating downtown urban environments, announced a $60 million . retail and entertainment complex between 10th streets and 3rd Avenue and Veterans Memorial Boulevard that would resemble an \"old-time small town\" and would fit within the \"historic context of the existing downtown.\" The developers had previously constructed similar developments in Newport, Kentucky with the completion of Newport on the Levee and Easton Town Center in Columbus. The project would include stores, restaurants and a 12 to 16-screen movie theater and would open in fall of 2002. Two parking structures would be constructed as well. The parking structure between 8th and 9th Street would be four-levels and include 940 parking spaces, but could be expanded upward to include an office tower; the parking structure between 9th and 10th Streets would be three-levels and include the movie complex on top. Broken down, the project plan included,\n\nThe plan included narrowing 3rd Avenue from four-lanes westbound towards the Robert C. Byrd Bridge to one lane in each direction with angled parking; however, this was later revised to one-lane in each direction with parallel parking and a center variable lane. The road narrowing plan was envisioned as a traffic calming measure.\n\nIn January 2002, the \"Huntington Urban Renewal Authority\" began eminent domain proceedings against \"Chi-Chi's\". The parent company of \"Chi-Chi's\", \"Prandium Inc.\", had refused to sell the property and rejected the city's final offer on October 19, 2000 and refused all negotiations and communications with the \"Authority\" and with \"Metropolitan Partners\". In March, \"Prandium Inc.\" refused an offer of $975,000 for the property plus $200,000 in relocation costs, which was over the appraised value of the property. The company requested a sale price of $2 million instead. The company, however, went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in March. In May, \"Chi-Chi's\" wanted to sell the property for $1.15 million, including undisclosed costs for relocation and loss of business, but later reversed out of the deal and wanted $1.75 million.\n\nDuring November 2002, \"Metropolitan Partners\" filed a grant request to the \"West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee\". It received $10.6 million in infrastructure improvements. A lawsuit was later filed by the Jackson County, West Virginia lawyer Larry Harless, questioning the legality of the committee and its work. Eventually, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia nullified the grant process and the grants that were given.\n\nOn March 26, 2003, the \"Superblock\" was sold to the developers of \"Pullman Square\", \"Metropolitan Partners\". Chi-Chi's had until April 15 to vacate; it was demolished on the 29th. The opening date had been pushed back from spring to summer 2004 due to a court case that was being considered by the West Virginia Supreme Court. In July 2003, the West Virginia Legislature passed legislation that withstood the \"Court of Appeals\"; however, the \"Pullman Square\" project had to be re-approved by the reconstituted grant committee. The grant money was once again awarded in August; however, two citizens' lawsuits by Larry Harless once again disputed the process. In their case, they stated that the state may provide loans to the projects but not to the grants, and questioned the legality of the state's video lottery. The \"West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee\" was to finance the grants by selling bonds which would be repaid from profits on video lottery.\n\nOn October 17, 2003, the state Supreme Court ruled that the state could proceed with the sale of bonds financing \"Pullman Square\" and 48 other projects throughout the state.\n\nConstruction began on Pullman Square on July 16, 2004 with the excavation of the parking lot for the parking structures. It opened on November 19, 2004 with Marquee Cinemas. Others, such as Empire Books & News, EB Games and Starbucks, opened in early December. In June 2005, the Funny Bone Comedy Club opened, followed by Cold Stone Creamery in July and pizzeria Uno Chicago Grill and Max & Erma's in August.\n\nA few months after opening, the Uno Chicago Grill was sued for not paying the builders, suppliers, and utilities. It soon changed its name to La Sha's West Virginia Bistro and was headed by Powerball winner Jack Whittaker; however, it closed on February 22, 2007 after another lawsuit was filed after Metropolitan Huntington LLC complained that the \"Bistro\" owed thousands for rent.\n\nEdible Arrangements was announced on August 5, 2006. The retail store, specializing in fruit bouquets and designer arrangements of fruit, opened in the fall. A few months later, on January 11, 2007, Moe's Southwest Grill closed for remodeling. The quick-casual restaurant later reluctantly announced that it was, in fact, moving to a nearby location on 9th Street. On March 17 Runway Couture opened next to Inspired, featuring west coast-inspired fashions; both are owned by Deneene Chafin. Moe's Southwest Grill maintained goodfaith talks with Pullman Square and after protracted negotiations Metropolitan Partners agreed to Moe's corporate lease arrangements and subsequently surrendered the keys to the former location on November 5, 2007.\n\nOn May 8, 2008, it was announced that Community Trust Bank would locate a bank branch at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street. It would include spaces for more retail that is currently \"under negotiations\". Construction began in August. The Garage Chophouse, however, pulled out of Pullman Square. In June, it was announced that Uno Chicago Grill would reopen under the franchise of Rick Rose, who owns some Bennigan's restaurants in Ohio, and under Mike Bartrum, a retired NFL player. The restaurant sells Chicago-style pizza and could open by July 30. Benny's Cheesesteaks opened on June 19, the second location for the Columbus, Ohio-based restaurant that sells Philadelphia-style hoagies, wings, wraps, and beer. Heels, a high-end shoe store owned by the owner of Inspired and Runway Couture made its debut in July.\n\nSince Pullman Square's opening in 2004, the lifestyle center has boasted many successes. \"Max & Erma's\" is the number one chain in the number of sales, while \"EB Games\" is number one in sales for their region. \"Cold Stone Creamery\" is listed as being in the top 10 of all stores in the United States.\n\n\n"}

Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1977. In 1988, Helmut Jahn designed an enclosed pedestrian walking bridge over Orleans Street connecting the building to Merchandise Mart. Originally built to serve as the world's largest wholesale buying center for the clothing industry, the building has more commonly known by several other names including River North Point, The Apparel Mart, and the Chicago Apparel Center. The building opened on November 6, 1976.\n\nThe property was formerly owned by Marshall Field who sold it to Joseph P. Kennedy and the building's grand opening was attended by the entire Kennedy family. The family owned the land upon which the building was constructed for over 50 years. After the building was constructed in 1976, it remained in the family for over 20 years, but was sold to Vornado Realty Trust in 1998 as part of a larger $625 million ($ million today) transaction including Merchandise Mart and several other properties. However, the family has retained its ownership interest in adjacent properties and continues to manage the Merchandise Mart business.\n\nThe building is associated with the neighboring Merchandise Mart to its east, which it is connected to by way of an enclosed pedestrian walkway and the two buildings are sometimes jointly referred to as the Merchandise Mart and Apparel Center or Merchandise Mart and Apparel Center Annex. The building is one of four distinct properties that are known as Chicago's Mart Center complex, also known as World Trade Center Chicago: The Merchandise Mart, the Chicago Apparel Center, the Merchandise Mart ExpoCenter and Wolf Point. In James Thompson’s original 58-block 1830 plat of Chicago, the property upon which the building is situated is represented by what was then designated as \"Block 7\" and a large portion of \"Block 6\", both of which are located at the fork of the Chicago River.\n\nWhen the building was constructed, it was the world's largest wholesale buying center, featuring over 1,000 display showrooms representing over 3,000 clothing lines. It was Chicago's attempt to replace New York City, where businessmen have to travel to 20 different buildings to see a comparable variety of clothing as the world's fashion center. Its completion bolstered the Merchandise Mart's claim of being the \"World's Largest Wholesale Buying Center\". The building was completed just as the downtown office space market recovered from the 1973–75 recession and was part of a boom of Near North Side hotel constructions. The adjacent parking lot has approximately 450 parking spaces. The grand opening ceremony on January 22, 1977 was attended by the Kennedy family, as well as Chicago Mayor Michael Bilandic. The grand opening celebration included a fashion show attended by 1,200 people.\n\nThe Kennedy-Vornado transaction occurred during an urban commercial real estate recovery that also saw the Sears Tower change hands at approximately the same time. Kennedy had purchased the property in 1945 or 1946 (depending on the source) from the Marshall Field family. John F. Kennedy, Jr. told a joke about Chicago that included the Merchandise Mart and Apparel Center: \"In the '40s, my grandfather bought the Merchandise Mart. In the '70s, there was the Apparel Center. And in the '60s election, my family bought 20,000 votes.\"\nThe Kennedys retained their interest in Wolf Point, the of land between Apparel Center and the Chicago River to the south of the building with an address of 340 North Orleans. There have been numerous plans to develop the property dating back to the late 1980s. In 2007, the Kennedys planned to develop the property with three high-rises and skyscrapers according to Cesar Pelli designs. The Wolf Point land is considered to have been the focal point of the earliest settlements in Chicago at the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nIn May 2015 The Blackstone Group purchased 350 North Orleans for $390 million from San Francisco-based owner Shorenstein Properties. Shorenstein had purchased the property in January 2012 for $228 million and invested an estimated $70 million in it.\n\nIn 2012 the last of the apparel showroom Tenants vacated and the building was converted to 100% commercial office. The existing Tenant base is primarily marketing firms and commodity trading firms. . The largest Tenants include Brookfield Properties Retail Group (formerly GGP), WPP plc (Ogilvy (agency) and Ronin Capital.\n\nThe building was constructed with no windows above the 3rd floor and below the 13th floor (the Hotel was constructed with windows for obvious reasons). In the mid-1990s as commercial office Tenants began to occupy the building, the building owners began replacing the original concrete pre-cast panels with windows. The current owner has had windows installed on 3 full floors and replaced partial height windows with full height windows on many of the floors that had already had windows installed. As of February 2018, there are only two elevations on the 8th floor of the north tower that are in need of window installation.\n\nIn 2018, the entire facade (from the 3rd floor upwards) was refinished and the original brown aggregate was painted, significantly improving its image. In addition, the building owner redeveloped the existing conference facility and created a Tenant Lounge known as River Room which contains a Tenant exclusive conference facility and approximately 9,000 square feet of high end lounge space for Tenants to meet outside of the office in a more casual setting. River Room has expansive views of the Chicago River and an adjacent bar / eatery is currently under construction.\n\nIn May of 2018 a high end fitness facility known as Studio350 was constructed in 10,000 square feet of vacant space on the 1st floor. The facility is exclusive to 350 North Orleans Tenants and offers a full range of classes (yoga, spinning, strength training) and is operated by LifeStart on behalf of the building owner.\n\nA Tenant exclusive roof deck has been constructed and appears to be opening in late 2018.\n\n\n"}

In the 2008 Malaysian General Elections, he supported the opposing political party, accusing the incumbent Prime Minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, of cronyism and corruption.\n\nOn 20 October 2012, Saiful became engaged to TV3 personality Nik Suriani Megat Deraman and subsequently married her on 25 May 2013. The couple was found doing a batik and songket business at a booth during UMNO General Assembly 2016 at Putra World Trade Centre (PWTC).\n\nAfter being dismissed from Uniten, Saiful became a volunteer worker at the Petaling Jaya branch office of the People's Justice Party (PKR). He was later appointed as a personal assistant to party leader, Anwar Ibrahim. One of his duties as personal assistant was to organize meetings with parliamentary members wanting to switch over to the People's Justice Party. The meetings were held in a privately owned condominium in Desa Damansara (Damansara Heights), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nSaiful accompanied Anwar Ibrahim on several of his overseas trips during this period including travel to Hong Kong (early May 2008), Bangkok (late May 2008) and Singapore (16 June and 18 June 2008), according to his passport. Saiful was also used to assist Anwar's chief of staff in creating and arranging Anwar's schedule.\n\nSaiful is an avid blogger and his blog has popular followings among pro-opposition as well as pro-government groups. In his blog, he once accused Anwar of trying to persuade members of parliament to jump parties.\n\nOn 7 August 2008, Anwar was charged in the Kuala Lumpur Session Court for sodomy without consent, the victim being Saiful. Saiful has alleged that he was sodomised by Anwar on numerous occasions. The last offence was committed on 26 June 2008, at 11-5-1 Desa Damansara Condominium, No 99, Jalan Setiakasih, Bukit Damansara, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nAnwar was charged under Section 377B Kanun Keseksaan of the Malaysian penal code, that can amount to 20 years incarceration and whipping if found guilty. He pleaded not guilty to the allegations.\n\nOn 15 August 2008, in the main hall of the Federal Territory Mosque, Jalan Duta, Kuala Lumpur, Saiful took an oath pursuant to the Shariah Islamic principles that he spoke the truth. The ceremony lasted 15 minutes and was witnessed by more than 30 people, including photographers and camera operators. No mainstream or government media were permitted to record the event. Before taking the oath, Saiful read a couple of verses from the Quran including the Surah Al-Fatihah.\n\nSaiful's oath :\n\nAmong those who witnessed the oath taking ceremony were Saiful's father Azlan Mohd Lazim and the mosque designated Imam Ramlang Porigi. A press conference was then held at the Dinasti Hotel, Kuala Lumpur.\n\nPerlis's mufti, Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin said that the oath taken by Saiful was in accordance with Islam. This is because he has declared with intent and proclaiming the divine words of Wallahi, Wabillahi, Watallahi.\n\nUnited Malays National Organisation (UMNO) Deputy Youth Chief Khairy Jamaluddin then said that Saiful's oath cannot be undermined as those who have taken the divine oath invoke Allah's wrath if they are lying.\n\nSaiful contested as an independent candidate in the Port Dickson by-election held on 13 October 2018 after the seat was vacated by it's incumbent member of parliament Danyal Balagopal Abdullah to enable Anwar to contest and be elected back to the parliament. Saiful only managed to get 82 votes and lost his electoral deposit in the seven-corners by-election which was won by Anwar with a majority of 23,560 votes on 13 October 2018.\n\n"}

The Freedom of the Press Foundation took over development of DeadDrop under the name \"SecureDrop\", and has since assisted with its installation at several news organizations, including ProPublica, \"The Guardian\", \"The Intercept\", and \"The Washington Post\".\n\nSecureDrop uses the anonymity network Tor to facilitate communication between whistleblowers, journalists, and news organizations. SecureDrop sites are therefore only accessible as hidden services in the Tor network. After a user visits a SecureDrop website, they are given a randomly generated code name. This code name is used to send information to a particular author or editor via uploading. Investigative journalists can contact the whistleblower via SecureDrop messaging. Therefore, the whistleblower must take note of their random code name.\n\nThe system utilizes private, segregated servers that are in the possession of the news organization. Journalists use two USB flash drives and two personal computers to access SecureDrop data. The first personal computer accesses SecureDrop via the Tor network, the journalist uses the first flash drive to download encrypted data from the Internet. The second personal computer does not connect to the Internet, and is wiped during each reboot. The second flash drive contains a decryption code.

{"id": "7518360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7518360", "title": "Street-level bureaucracy", "text": "Street-level bureaucracy\n\nStreet-level bureaucracy is the subset of a public agency or government institution where the civil servants work who have direct contact with members of the general public. Street-level civil servants carry out and/or enforce the actions required by a government's laws and public policies, in areas ranging from safety and security to education and social services. A few examples include police officers, border guards, social workers and public school teachers. These civil servants have direct contact with members of the general public, in contrast with civil servants who do policy analysis or economic analysis, who do not meet the public. Street-level bureaucrats act as liaisons between government policy-makers and citizens and these civil servants implement policy decisions made by senior officials in the public service and/or by elected officials.\n\nStreet-level bureaucrats interact and communicate with the general public, either in person (as with a police officer doing a random checkpoint to check for drunk driving or a civil servant in a department of transportation who helps people to register a newly purchased car and provide them with licence plates); over the phone (as with a government call center, where civil servants answer phone calls from people who are applying for or receiving unemployment insurance); or, in jurisdictions which have implemented electronic government technologies, via the Internet (e.g., a person finding out about the government's taxation laws by going onto the taxation department's official website and asking questions to a civil servant via email).\n\nStreet-level bureaucrats often have some degree of discretion on how they enforce the rules, laws and policies which they are assigned to uphold. For example, a police officer who catches a speeding motorist typically can decide whether to give the driver a warning or apply a penalty such as a fine or criminal charge; a border guard who finds undeclared rum in a border-crossing motorist's car trunk can either give the person a warning, confiscate and destroy the contraband item, or levy a fine or other penalty; a government social worker who meets with an unemployed person can decide whether or not to provide social assistance or unemployment insurance benefits; and a high school principal who finds that a student is skipping school can decide whether or not to suspend the person, taking into account the student's unique circumstances and situation. Even though front-line bureaucrats have this degree of discretion, they typically must operate within the rule of law, the system of government regulations, laws and administrative procedural rules. These regulations, laws and rules help to ensure that the street-level bureaucracy operates fairly and ethically, and that each citizen is treated fairly.\n\nThe concept of street-level bureaucracy was first coined by Michael Lipsky in 1969(), who argued that \"policy implementation in the end comes down to the people [(the street-level bureaucrats)] who actually implement it\". However, the process of street-level bureaucracy has been around for a much longer period. A \"government will be better accepted if its administrators [e.g., bureaucrats] reflect the origins [and needs] of its people\", an ideal which embodies the goals of an effective street-level bureaucracy in America. Some of the first street-level bureaucrats in the US were post office officials and administrators. The presidency of Woodrow Wilson helped to spur a large growth in public administration and government policy-making, which in turn led to larger-sized and better-funded street-level bureaucracies. However it was not until the 1950s with the baby boom that street level bureaucracy became as strong as a presence in society as it is in the 2000s.\n\nLipsky describes street level bureaucrats as the \"human face\" of policy, since these individuals interact directly with citizens. The history of street-level bureaucracy follows the history of policy development and the scope of government in America, with areas with larger populations and more government policies employing more public servants (e.g., Chicago which employs 26,680 teachers).() Due to street-level bureaucrats' close interactions with citizens, day-to-day application of discretion in their assessment of people's cases and issues, and their role as policy interpreters, Lipsky claims that \"in a sense the street-level bureaucrats implicitly mediate aspects of the constitutional relationship of citizens to the state. In short, they hold the keys to a dimension of citizenship.\"() The interpretation of the duties, scope, and responsibilities of street-level bureaucrats are still debated in the 2000s, with ongoing discussion on the roles of discretion, accountability, lack of resources, and technology and concerns raised about the risks of corruption.\n\nWhere there is population growth, there is usually growth in demand for these occupations, because there are more citizens who need public services. The demand for these occupations will vary by region but generally, the job outlook in these careers is on the rise in many countries and/or regions where there is an increase in population.\n\nIn the United States' education sector there is a strong demand for teachers in numerous regions across the country. There are currently fifty-one \"hot spots\" with a demand for educators in these regions. Amongst these fifty-one hot spots, five of the regions are with an incredible need for educators in both the primary and secondary education sector. The areas of desperate need include: Las Vegas, Nevada; the Northern region of Oklahoma; Kansas City, Missouri; the Central region of Arkansas; and the Western region of Mississippi.\n\nThe demand for police officers is another occupation that will experience growth over the next ten years. Because urbanized and metropolitan regions are amongst the fastest growing in the United States, that is generally where the demand for these individuals will be.\n\nFirefighters are another case in protective services where an increase in demand is expected over the next decade. A seven percent increase in career outlook is to be expected by the year 2022.\n\nThe demand for social workers has an average growth rate in the United States. With a general population increase social workers are needed in all areas of the career field. The demand for social workers is extremely high. The national average for growth in all careers stands at eleven percent, while a projected nineteen percent increase in social work is needed to fulfill the sectors responsibility to the general public.\n\nCorruption in street-level bureaucracy is a violation of the ethical codes of conduct, laws and regulations that have been established by the government and its agencies. An example of corruption would be cases where a police officer or border guard accepted a bribe from a member of the public in return for not enforcing a law or regulation. There are many agencies which define and interpret what is acceptable ethical behavior and what is not. Violation of these rules or ethical codes of conduct by street-level bureaucrats has repercussions that effect not only the person or agency involved, but also the general public that these street-level bureaucracies serve. Neutrality and impartiality in following policies and procedures is what is expected and most remain separate from person feelings or views. Here is a link to a social work case that let personal feelings override there ethical responsibility.\n\nAnother example for corruption in street-level bureaucracy are black market payments for doctors and nurses, as part of the shadow economy. The term \"black market medicine\" refers to a variety of illegal actions that individuals take in order to obtain healthcare services for themselves. Such actions include direct payments to doctors in government hospitals to improve one's position on the waiting list (especially for surgeries) or payments to doctors so they will treat the patient personally. \n\nAccountability is the means by which these codes are upheld and to ensure moral and ethical practices within these bureaucratic agencies. There is much debate over the methodology of how exactly these agencies should be held accountable. Accountability is divided into five categories: transparency, liability, controllability, responsibility, and responsiveness.\n\nTwo major accountability processes are compliance based and performance based. \"Traditionally, accountability has involved defining rules and procedures and then employing various means to ensure compliance with these expectations\" Performance-based practices rely on standardized processes that measure performance in terms of output and results. Yet compliance based, and performance based accountability has limitations for measuring the efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and economy of the bureaucracy. Furthermore, accountability stems from a multidimensional perspective, which includes the general public the bureaucracy serves, peers and co-workers, office managers, public administrators, and elected officials.\n\nDiscretion can be defined as a component in the decision making process that determines an individual's action or non-action. Carrington divides discretion into two major components as the freedom the decision maker has to choose between different actions; and the decision to act or not act through the rules and judgment of the decision maker. Michael Lipsky states street level bureaucrats have discretion because human judgment is in the nature of service work that machines could not replace. Street level bureaucrats are responsible for making appropriate decisions that are appropriate for clients and their situations. Lipsky states all street level bureaucrats will confront situations in which they need to depart from service ideals in order to cope with both expectations from their jobs and the public ideals. \n\nAccording to Lipsky, the exercise of discretion among street level bureaucrats is critical in how public servants interact with citizens on a daily basis. He claims to understand these acts of discretion once must analyze the outcome of agency performance the public experiences as a combined result of agency rules and street level bureaucrats responses to unsanctioned work. Lipsky said the use of discretion by street level bureaucrats can’t be removed from everyday practice due to the complexity and uncertainty of human service work. Carrington identifies the fear of power abuse as a major reason for the opposition of discretion in the arena of street level bureaucrats and its citizens. In order to control problems in discretionary action there has been a demand for control by understanding the social situations in which discretion varies. Marissa Kelly also examines the use of discretion among street level bureaucrats to assert that discretion can either enhance or inhibit street level bureaucrats’ implementation of justice. She asserts that whether discretion is appropriate or not justice theories need to be further examined.\n\nLipsky concludes that the lack of resources causes street level bureaucrat to develop simplified routines for processing cases that influence their everyday tasks. These routines for decisionmaking affect public policy. He states that street level bureaucrats are taught implementation skills instead of learning about how to find more resources, knowledge and information that would help them to implement policies more effectively. Hill identifies several implementation resources street level bureaucrats often lack such as; research resources, appropriate resources on how to shape specific policies for their specific situation, and access to expertise and skills training to better their decision-making and awareness in specific challenging situations that arise at the street level. Another key resource that front-line bureaucrats often lack is time to fully assess individual cases. In social services, social workers often have such a large caseload that they can only see social assistance recipients or applicants for a very short time each week. As a result, social workers have to make very rapid decisions as to whether to approve or deny welfare benefits.\n\nTechnological advances such as the widespread availability of the Internet and online databases have had a major impact on street-level bureaucracy and the front-line civil servants who provide services to citizens. There are two major theories on how technology has impacted this sector: curtailment theory and enablement theory. Curtailment theory holds that increasing technological advances hinder street-level bureaucrats and their ability to perform effectively; especially concerning their ability to exercise discretion on complex cases. Enablement theory holds that increasing technological advances, at best, empower the existing abilities of the street-level bureaucrat and better inform the citizen. At worst, the effects of technology are ambiguous.\n\nIt was first argued by Snellen that increasing technological advances (ITA) \"deeply challeng[e] [the street-level bureaucrat's] ability to manipulate information.\" Snellen believed it was the ability to manipulate information that gave the SLB's their power. He further argued that as more decisions are made by computers or software, SLB's will lose their discretionary powers and they will shift to other actors. For example, in the 2010, some government organizations use online application forms for programs in which the computer program, rather than a human front-line bureaucrat, will reject applications which are incomplete. In a pre-technological advances era, a front-line bureaucrat might have used his or her discretion over decisions to allow an application in which some of the information requests are not completed (e.g., due to urgent need on the part of the citizen or the existence of an emergency situation). For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, if a social worker received a hand-written, pen-and-paper application from a homeless person for social assistance, the bureaucrat might approve the application even if the applicant did not have a street address or the required identification documents, to ensure that the applicant remained housed and safe.\nHowever, there are four problems with this thesis. First, it is implied, but never proven, that with the arrival of more technology, discretion at the frontline will diminish or become non-existent. Second, Snellen's definition of the SLB's source of power is too narrow and does not take into account other sources of discretion. Third, this thesis only pertains to particular public organizations and does not apply to more common types of street-level bureaucracies such as police departments, schools, or social welfare departments. Lastly, this theory does not take into account how SLB's and other caseworkers actually utilize this new technology and how that might affect their performance.\n\nIn contrast to the curtailment theory, a 2007 study by Jorna and Wagenaar showed that ITA was able to increase the amount of work done while cutting down on inconsistencies. However, the meaning and content of this work was not able to be captured and understood by ITA. A 2004 study by Vitalis and Duhaut \nhighlighted the ambiguous nature of ITA. It was shown that the Internet or other forms of technology were utilized for simpler tasks, and more elaborate and complex matters were dealt with face-to-face with citizens. Vitalis and Duhaut come to the conclusion that a SLB has their discretionary power enhanced by ITA, and citizens benefit from ITA by being better informed of their rights when dealing with SLBs and \ntheir institutions. This theory maintains that discretion by the SLB is not hindered in anyway by ITA and will continue to do their jobs effectively. This theory also focuses more on how ITA is utilized by both citizens and state agents which puts more emphasis on the ability of ITA to further help and empower SLBs and citizens.\n\n\n"}

His philanthropic interests include the environment, particularly the Tambling Wildlife Nature Conservation a 45,000 hectare forest, endangered wildlife and sea conservation area, located in southern Sumatra.\n\nHe is the son of an automobile spare parts trader and left school in the seventh grade upon which he sold ice pops to support his family. According to The Washington Post, he then \"rose from a car washer and office boy to become one of the nation's richest men\". In 2006, he was listed as #35 on a Forbes list of \"the 40 richest men in Indonesia\".\n\nWinata's business empire has been developed under the Artha Graha Group and Artha Graha Network. In 1988, he worked with the Indonesian Army Foundation to rescue a troubled local bank, Bank Propelat, and subsequently changed its name to Bank Artha Graha. In mid-1997, in cooperation with Bank Indonesia he bailed out Bank Arta Prima, which was then merged with Bank Artha Graha. In 2003, Artha Graha Group took over Bank Inter-pacific, Tbk (a publicly listed company). In 2005, Bank Inter-pacific, Tbk acquired Bank Artha Graha becoming Bank Artha Graha Internasional, Tbk (INPC.JK).\n\nWinata is involved in the property sector through PT Jakarta International Hotels and Development, Tbk (JIHD.JK, a publicly listed company), which owns Borobudur Hotel in Central Jakarta, and PT Danayasa Arthatama, Tbk (SCBD.JK, a publicly listed company), which owns the Sudirman Central Business District (SCBD) in the heart of Jakarta. SCBD includes the Indonesian Stock Exchange Building. Winata plans to build the Signature Tower Building-Jakarta, a 111-storey skyscraper, which will be the fifth tallest building in the world, in the center of the SCBD. He has said the mega-project is part of his mission to show the world that \"Indonesia can\". His vision is to make SCBD the \"Manhattan of Indonesia\".\nHe is active in the infrastructure sector, through the company PT Bangungraha Sejahtera Mulia, which obtained support from the governors of Banten and Lampung provinces to be the lead investor for the Sunda Strait Bridge project which, if it proceeds, will be the largest single infrastructure project ever undertaken in Indonesia. Based on Indonesian Presidential Regulation Number 86, dated 2 December 2011, the Lampung-Banten consortium with PT Bangungraha Sejahtera Mulia was appointed to be the Project Initiator to work on a feasibility study for the Sunda Strait Bridge Project and Strategic Area Development. Following the Presidential Regulation, Banten and Lampung provinces together with PT Bangun Sejahtera Mulia established a joint venture company called PT Graha Banten Lampung Sejahtera (GBLS) to conduct the Sunda Strait feasibility study. Based on its pre-feasibility study, Sunda Strait Project construction cost was estimated around US$10 billion and will take around 8 to 10 years to develop.\n\nThe Sunda Strait Bridge Project has progressed from an \"impossible dream\" in 2002 to becoming \"almost a possible reality\" in 2012, but in 2014 new president Joko Widodo shelved the project.\n\nWinata also has business ventures outside of Indonesia, including in Timor Leste, where he was given approval in secret to build a hotel and shopping complex on government-owned land without having to submit his bid to a tendering process.\n\nBesides his legal operations, Tomy is also a member of the so-called \"nine dragons\", a group comprising the major individuals behind Jakarta's gambling industry, despite the practice being banned in Indonesia.\n\nAside from his businesses, Winata has established a social non-profit foundation called Artha Graha Peduli Foundation (AG Peduli Foundation), which has five major social activities: provision of emergency relief to victims of natural disasters in Indonesia and abroad; humanitarian programs in food resilience, education and health; programs to save the environment; people empowerment through Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs); and provision of legal assistance for the underprivileged.\n\nWinata runs a rescue center for the critically endangered Sumatran tiger in Tambling Wildlife Nature Conservation, a park in Lampung Province, Sumatra. Here he tries to reintroduce \"conflict tigers\"—tigers that have attacked or killed humans—into the wild. TWNC has released five Sumatran tigers back to the TWNC forest, and was also able to release other protected wildlife and animals such as crocodiles and turtles. In addition to 45,000 hectares of forest, TWNC includes 14,500 hectares of sea conservation area.\n\nWinata has cooperated with the Indonesian Narcotics Agency (Badan Narkotika Nasional-BNN) to organize a drug rehabilitation program in TWNC. The program combines rehab and environmental conservation, encouraging former drug users to re-establish their lives and livelihoods through work in TWNC conservation and eco-tourism. This program was presented by Winata at the UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) 2013 Annual Meeting in Vienna, Austria. UNODC's Executive Director, Yuri Fedotov, expressed appreciation to Winata for the TWNC program, and said UNODC will encourage other countries to visit Tambling to study its drug rehabilitation program.\nIn March 2013, in Madrid, Spain, Winata together with the Bali Mangrove Care Forum appointed \"Cristiano Ronaldo\" (CR7), the top Real Madrid soccer player, to be the Ambassador of Mangroves. Winata and Ronaldo agreed to conserve existing mangroves and plant new ones, especially in Bali surrounding areas.\n\nIn a high-profile case against the news magazine \"Tempo\" following an article's \"Ada Tomy in Tenebang?\" (Is there Tomy in Tanah Abang ?) published in the March 3, 2003 issue of \"Tempo\", \"Tempo\" editor-in-chief Bambang Harymurti was found guilty.\n\nThe Central Jakarta District Court ordered \"Tempo\" magazine to publicly apologize and to pay a fine of 500 million rupiah (US$59,000). Tomy filed libel charges against PT Tempo Inti Media; chief editor Bambang Harymurti; chief deputy editor Toriq Hadad; reporters Ahmad Taufik, Bernarda Rurit, and Cahyo Junaidi; publisher Fikri Jufri and corporate director Zulkifli Lubis, according to a Tempo report. The presiding judge stated that, \"Tempo failed to find the truth by covering both sides before publishing the article,\" said a report in The Jakarta Post. However, this conviction was later overturned on appeal.\n\nIn another high-profile case, in the provision of travellers cheques used in 2004 to bribe Indonesian politicians to elect Miranda Swaray Goeltom as Senior Deputy Governor in the Indonesian central bank, Bank Indonesia, has been widely reported in the Indonesian media.\nMiranda said he did not know the owner of Bank Artha Graha. \"Who owns it?\" she told Tempo last Friday. \"I do not know.\"\n\n"}

In other words, it has become attractive as a tax haven.\n\nThe Tax Justice Network ranks the US third in terms of the secrecy and scale of its offshore financial industry, behind Switzerland and Hong Kong but ahead of the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg. The United States has been popular as a destination for offshore funds for Chinese investors, said Canadian financial crimes expert Bill Majcher, because investors think it will resist pressure from China. Andrew Penney from Rothschild & Co described the US as \"effectively the biggest tax haven in the world\" and Trident Trust Co., one of the world's biggest providers of offshore trusts, moved dozens of accounts out of Switzerland and Grand Cayman, and into Sioux Falls, saying: \"Cayman was slammed in December, closing things that people were withdrawing ... I was surprised at how many were coming across that were formerly Swiss bank accounts, but they want out of Switzerland.\"\n\nA 2012 study by various US universities showed that the US has the most lenient regulations for setting up a shell company anywhere in the world outside of Kenya. Tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, Jersey and the Bahamas were far less permissive, researchers found, than states such as Nevada, Delaware, Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming and New York. \"[Americans] discovered that they really don't need to go to Panama\", said James Henry of the Tax Justice Network. For example, a single address in Wilmington (1209 North Orange Street) — is listed as the headquarters for no fewer than 285,000 separate businesses due to Delaware's desirable corporate taxes and law, and it is estimated that 9 billion dollars of potential taxes is lost over the past decade, due to the Delaware loophole. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have firms registered in North Orange Street, and lawyers, trust companies and financial firms including Rothschild & Co are moving offshore accounts from locations such as Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into the US to take advantage of the country's loose regulations, calling it the \"new Switzerland\" (see Banking in Switzerland).\n\nMark Hays of Global Witness said \"the US is one of the easiest places to set up so-called anonymous shell companies\", and Stefanie Ostfeld from the same organization said that \"the US is just as big a secrecy jurisdiction as so many of these Caribbean countries and Panama\". More than 1.1 million live legal entities were incorporated in Delaware at the end of 2014. An increasing number – more than 70% – of those were LLCs. The Delaware Division of Corporations said in August 2015 that \"an LLC entices all types of people since it is easy to operate and oversee\", and Delaware is currently one of the few states without sales tax. Delaware does not tax companies which operate there, nor their royalty income. However, the LLC is more popular and often less expensive in states such as Wyoming, Nevada and Oregon. Approximately 668,000 anonymous LLCs are registered just in those three states.\n\nDespite this, the US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) said in 2014 that the United States loses roughly $184 billion per year due to corporations such as Pfizer, Microsoft and Citigroup using offshore tax havens to avoid paying US taxes.

An automobile enthusiast, he is best known as the founder of the Targa Florio.\nHe was the son of the Senator of the Kingdom of Italy, Ignazio Florio Sr. and baroness Giovanna D'Ondes Trigona. He was born in Palermo and was named after his grandfather Vincenzo Florio Sr. (1799–1886) who founded the Florio wine and spice company. He was the younger brother of Ignazio Florio Jr.. Not inclined to business, he loved traveling and was a frequent visitor of Paris, Nice, Montecarlo and Cannes. Luxury boats were one of his passions: in the family they owned five yachts. In 1909 he married principessa Annina Alliata di Montereale. After her death to cholera in 1911, he married Lucie Henry of Épernay, France, a year later.\n\nAn automobile enthusiast, he initiated the financial basis and the engineering plans for the \"Brescia Motor Week\" in Brescia, Lombardy. He had finished third in the 1904 edition, and generously funding the 1905 race, which was renamed Coppa Florio. He donated 50,000 lire and a Cup for the winner. His greatest fame came from creating the Targa Florio race in 1906, based on discussions with James Gordon Bennett Jr. and Henri Desgrange. The Targa also claimed to be a worldly event not to be missed. Renowned artists, such as Alexandre Charpentier and Leonardo Bistolfi, were commissioned to design medals. A magazine was initiated, \"Rapiditas\", which aimed to enhance, with graphic and photographic reproductions of the race, the myth of the car and the typical character of modern life, speed.\n\nFlorio also raced himself. His best result was the win in the Targa Rignano (Padova - Bovolenta) 1903, named after Count Rignano, thus inspiring Florio to pick the surname-based Targa Florio. His own racing team, however, got Felice Nazzaro to leave Fiat and join as driver, who had won the 1907 race. In 1913 Vincenzo Florio founded the Automobile Club of Sicily, of which he remained president for a long time.\n\nHe died at Épernay.

He was affiliated with the company for over 64 years, and was a board member from 1973 to 2003. He was a grandson of Adolph Coors (1847–1929) the company's founder.\n\nBorn in Golden, Colorado on August 11, 1916, he was the son of Adolph Coors II and Alice Kistler May (1885–1970), and the brother of Adolph Coors III (1916–60) and Joseph Coors Sr. (1917–2003). Coors earned a bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1938, and a master's degree in chemical engineering in 1939.\n\nCoors had three daughters with his first wife Geraldine, who suffered from alcoholism and died of illness. William remarried in the 1960s and he and his wife, Phyllis, had one son, Scott. Coors' oldest daughter Geraldine committed suicide August 5, 1983 at the age of 40 after suffering from depression.\n\nCoors turned 100 in August 2016 and died on October 13, 2018, aged 102.\n\nWilliam Coors entered the family business as a chemical engineer for Coors Brewing Company in 1939.\n\nCoors was respected in the industry for his ability in packaging, bottling, and engineering. He is credited with pioneering the recyclable two-piece aluminum can, which is now standard throughout the industry. In the 1950s, Coors requested $250,000 from his father, CEO Adolph Coors, Jr., to build an experimental line of aluminum cans. By the early 1960s, can recycling was viable, and the company offered customers a one-cent deposit on returned cans.\n\nCoors was elected to the board of directors in 1973. When the non-brewing assets (e.g., Coors Ceramics Co.) of Adolph Coors Co. were spun off in 1992 as ACX Technologies Inc., he served as chairman of both companies.\n\nIn 2003, at the age of 87, Coors retired from the boards of the Adolph Coors Company and the Coors Brewing Company, although he remained with the company as chief technical adviser.\n\nWilliam Coors' political views were considered to be more moderate and less outspoken than his brother Joe's. For example, Joe's public opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment in 1988 earned the company the ire of feminist groups, even though William was on record supporting the amendment.\n\nCoors was criticized for remarks he made on February 23, 1984, in a seminar held by the Minority Business Development Center in Denver. In off-the-cuff remarks, he stated that \"...ancestors were dragged here in chains against their will… I would urge those of you who feel that way to go back to where your ancestors came from, and you will find out that probably the greatest favor that anybody ever did you was to drag your ancestors over here in chains, and I mean it.\" He also remarked Africa's economic problems stemmed from \"a lack of intellectual capacity.\"\n\nCoors apologized in a press conference the next day for his \"unfortunate choice of words and lack of sensitivity,\" and said he hoped his commitment to minority groups spoke louder than his words. He stated that his words were taken out of context by the \"Rocky Mountain News\", which he later sued for libel. A number of people who attended the speech reported that the remarks were not considered offensive. An informal boycott of Coors was announced by the NAACP during a March 2 meeting in Los Angeles. At the time, the AFL-CIO had been boycotting the company for seven years over a labor dispute. At least 500 liquor stores in Southern California joined the NAACP boycott, which was suspended five days later when they reached an agreement with the company. In September, the Adolph Coors Company signed an agreement with Operation PUSH and the NAACP to invest $325 million into black communities over five years, to deposit millions of operating capital in black-owned banks, and to spend $8.8 million on advertising in black-owned media. In October, the company negotiated a similar agreement with American GI Forum and La Raza for $300 million. This was the first ever such arrangement between La Raza and any corporation.\n\nIn 1987, Coors dropped his libel suit after the \"Rocky Mountain News\" printed an article commending Coors' good record with the minority community, and expressing regret for the headline over the February 24, 1984 article.\n\n\n"}

Lough\n\nWilliam Henry Lough, Jr. (May 11, 1881 - 1950s) was an American economist, and Professor of Finance and Transportation in New York University School of Commerce, known for his work in the field of corporate finance.\n\nLough was born in Dayton, Ohio to William Henry Lough and Esther Green Stubbs. He obtained his AB from the Oshkosh State Normal School (now University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh) in 1899, and his AM from Harvard University in 1902. He married Elizabeth Howe Shepard on August 24, 1907 in De Pere, Wisconsin.\n\nLough started his career at the traffic department of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1902. In 1904-05 he worked on the editorial staff of \"The Wall Street Journal\". In 1905 he joined the New York University School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance as Assistant Professor and got promoted Professor of Finance and Transportation. In 1910 he co-founded and became Vice-president of the Alexander Hamilton Institute, a corporation engaged in collecting, organizing and transmitting business information. He was also president of the Business Book Bureau. Later in the 1910s he became president of the Business Training Corporation in New York City. In 1915 he investigated the financial conditions in South America for the US Department of Commerce. Around 1917 Lough was responsible for launching the College of Business at the American Expeditionary Forces University. He was also Head of Division of Business Training of Army Educational Corps, American Expeditionary Forces in France.\n\nIn the summer of 1921 he was lecturer on Business Management at the University of California. Further in the 1920s Lough continued his work at the School of Commerce of New York University, and as president of the Business Training Corporation. but by 1925 he was listed as 'formerly professor of economics, New York University.' He was President of the Charter League of New Rochelle.\n\nIn the 1930s Lough had founded Trade-Ways, industrial consultants and became its president. Trade-Ways \"studied industry problems and made preliminary survey of what should go into an indoctrination and training program. Its field staff worked out several different programs and tested them out with salesmen.\" In 1935 he published his last book \"High-Level Consumption\" (1935) with assistance of the economist and statistician Martin R. Gainsborough, who was employed at Trade-Ways.\n\nIn a 1910 review Hammond stated, that Professor Lough's book is the most comprehensive, the most scholarly and the best written treatise on the subject of corporation finance which has appeared in this country. Like the other volumes in the series of which it is a part, the book was written primarily in the interest of business men, although the author expresses the hope that it will also prove useful to stock and bond brokers, to lawyers, to bankers and to accountants. It is sure to do this but it is also bound to be of great use to teachers and students in the courses in business administration in our colleges and universities. It is more than probable that it was the author's experience with just such students which accounts in large measure for the clearness and logical method of his presentation.\n\nThe book is not a philosophical treatise on corporations. It contains no history of the corporation movement and there is little discussion of the place occupied by the corporation in our modern business life or of the difficult problem of securing its public control in the interest of the people at large. Such supervision as is needed the author seems to believe can be secured by means of publicity and careful accounting. The book is written by a man in thorough sympathy with the idea that the corporation affords the best method of carrying on modern business transactions, and the movement towards corporate consolidation he believes to be in the interest of the public as well as of the investors in corporate securities.\n\nThis book is primarily descriptive of the methods of promoting, organizing and financing corporations, and all the illustrations are taken from the experience of American companies. In the first six chapters the author deals with the legal character and requirements of the corporation.\n\nIn the chapter about the interior organization Lough goes into the powers and liabilities of directors. Lough started explaining that \"in theory, however, even if not in practice, a board of directors is supposed to represent all the stockholders equally. Partly for that reason the board... is given complete control over the corporation's assets and officers.\" Also in the organization, there is a \"centralization of control,' which can be compared to a double pyramid (see image). Lough explained:\n\nThe base of one pyramid represents the body of stockholders or owners of the corporation who delegate their rights as owners to the directors, who in turn transfer all active authority to the president or other chief executive officer, who is at the apex of that pyramid. The other pyramid represents the subordinate officials and employees of the corporation. The chief executive officer is also the apex of this pyramid and transmits his orders through the various grades of subordinates to the clerks and laborers at the base of the pyramid. Thus responsibility and authority conferred by the stockholders and exercised over the employees are both centered in this chief executive officer. It is an organization almost ideally adapted, so far as efficiency and economy go, to the conditions of present-day industry.\n\nOverall the first six chapters of the book contains little that is new. It is derived, as the author suggests, largely from Thomas Conyngton's \"The Modern Corporation\" (1910). Worthy of notice in this part, however, is the distinction which Professor Lough draws between \"the parent company\" and \"the holding company.\" Lough stated:\n\nA parent company is one that for some reason does not desire to carry on operations in its own name over the whole country, and which therefore organizes and holds all or nearly all the stock of one or more subordinate companies... A holding company proper on the other hand, using the term in a financial, not a legal sense, comes into existence for the purpose of buying control of pre-existing companies. Its ostensible object is the buying of securities of other corporations to be held for whatever revenues they will produce. The real object of its existence, however, is not accomplished unless it holds control of all its subsidiary companies and directs their operations. Sometimes this control consists in holding a bare majority of the voting stock of the subsidiary; but it is generally advisable to secure as much stock as possible, for the greater the extent of the control, the more readily may the holding company carry out its plans to achieve economies and fix prices.\n\nLough also noted that \"holding companies may be formed, not only to acquire stock of operating companies, but also to obtain control of other holding companies.\" Such organization can become rather complex, and any examples may require considerable explanation. Lough continued:\n\nThe reader will get a sufficiently clear idea as to how complex organizations of this kind are built up if he will study the accompanying chart of the Interborough-Metropolitan Company, which was prepared for the Public Service Commission of the First District of the State of 'New York. The Interborough-Metropolitan Company controls all the street car, elevated and subway railway lines in the principal boroughs of New York City. It was formed, as shown in the chart, by an exchange of its securities for the securities of two formerly competing companies, the Metropolitan Securities Company and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. The relations of these two companies to each other, to their direct subsidiaries, and to the subsidiaries of their subsidiaries, are as clearly as possible presented in the chart.\"\n\nTo illustrate further the extent, as well as the complexity, Lough gave a second example of Standard Oil Company with a complete listing of over 100 subsidiaries controlled by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey.\n\nChapters 7-11 of the work deal with the various methods of raising funds and with the credit instruments to which they give rise. The author says: \"Only one method of raising funds is cheaper than borrowing and that method is stealing.\" In view of some recent episodes in corporation finance it is doubtful whether even this exception need have been made. By a study of the balance sheets of several large corporations, the author endeavors to show that failure to borrow largely is a sign of weak and injudicious financial management. Particularly good in this section of the book is the discussion of short time loans.\n\nChapter 12-15 deal with the work of the promoter in establishing new enterprise, and in consolidating old ones and this section concludes with an excellent chapter on the United States Steel Corporation. In Chapters 16-19 the author describes the four methods of selling securities: by inside distribution; through Wall Street; through bond and brokerage houses; and by means of advertising. The relative advantages of these various methods are thoroughly discussed and there is much in these chapters which should prove valuable to the buyer as well as to the seller of securities.\n\nIn chapter 19 Lough explains the working of syndicates, and gives and example of how a new plant was constructed wholly with borrowed funds. \n\nA syndicate of Philadelphia and Baltimore capitalists and banking houses was formed to underwrite the enterprise. Next an entirely different syndicate of banking houses was organized, which agreed to take the notes(when issued up to a certain amount) of syndicate No. I, the notes to be secured by the stock of a corporation organized to construct the plant. The corporation was capitalized at $2,000,000, half preferred and half common stock. All its stock was sold to syndicate No. I, for $1,000,000. Syndicate No. I then posted the stock and gave notes to syndicate No. II, who loaned the $1,000,000. Thus syndicate No. I was not called upon for cash, except for expenses, and the construction company was supplied with $1,000,000 with which to begin operations.\nNext, after expending the $1,000,000, the construction company issued $500,000 of its own notes, which being its only obligations were accepted by Philadelphia banks... Up to this point one-half the necessary funds had been secured and at the end of two years the work of construction had been more than half completed. Now a new corporation was formed which was to operate the plant. The reader will observe that the first corporation existed simply to carry on construction. The operating corporation at once took over the stock of the construction company, title to which up to this time had remained with syndicate No. I. Then the operating corporation put out a first-mortgage bond issue, based on all its property then owned and thereafter to be constructed, and sold during the next two years $1,500,000 of bonds. In this way the whole $3,000,000 necessary to build the plant was raised by borrowing and the members of syndicate No. I furnished nothing to the enterprise but their credit. The diagram on page 282 will perhaps assist the reader in arriving at a clear understanding of the whole series of transactions.\n\nLough told about the actual situation, that \"the plant at the date of writing has been running a little over two years. Earnings have been more than sufficient to meet all interest charges and other expenses, and it is expected that large profits will be earned in the future...\" He ended with explaining, that \"it may seem strange that a new plant could thus be constructed wholly with borrowed funds; yet there is nothing especially unusual about the operation. The secret of the success of the syndicate in this instance lay in the fact that they were themselves strong financially and could borrow the first $1,000,000 readily...\"\n\nChapters 20-24 deal with an honest financial management of corporations and discuss some of the difficult problems with which financial managers have to deal; such as the proportion of working capital, betterment expenses, and the handling of the surplus. With reference to betterment expenses Professor Lough is inclined to favor the policy of the Pennsylvania Railroad in providing for those expenses which are bound to result in a permanent saving or profit, by means of bond issues, and for those expenses (like the New York tunnels), which may or may not yield profits in the near future, by appropriations from the surplus.\n\nIn chapters 25-37 are revealed the tricks and methods of \"high finance.\" This part of the work the author advises those who are \"morally weak\" to omit, but they may well be perused by \"innocent investors.\" The various methods of manipulation are classified according as they are carried on by the officers, the directors, or by and for the stock holders. Finally, come three excellent chapters on insolvency and reorganization with illustrations drawn from the financial history of the Santa Fe, the Rock Island and the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. About 25 pages of \"quiz questions\" are given at the end of the book.\n\nCorporation finance is not treated by Professor Lough as a part of economics although closely related to it. His treatment of the subject is much like the German method of treating public finance — a subject somewhat dependent on economics but having its own independent set of principles.\n\nA 1918 review of this work by Arthur S. Dewing (1880-1971) stated, that this book represents an important study of modern financial practice, especially with reference to medium-sized industrial corporations. More than the majority of books on corporation finance heretofore published, it seeks to discover what might be called a financial \"ought,\" which differentiates between good and bad financial policies. Everyone knows the fundamental difficulty which brought about the receiverships of the Atchison or the Westinghouse companies. These are stock illustrations. But Lough's insistence that the private corporation should prepare a budget is, in the reviewer's opinion, a new and important contribution.\n\nThe book is divided into five parts. The first covers general and well known characteristics of corporations in contradistinction to other forms of enterprise ; the second describes the media through which the corporation may secure capital; and the third the practical problems of securing it. Of these three parts the concluding chapter of the second (ch. 8) entitled Basis of Capitalization is the most constructive and worthwhile. Especially important in the haze of present-day attempts to establish a sound basis for public regulation of corporate income is Lough's insistence that earning power, not original investment, is the most rational basis of capitalization. In accordance with this theory one would wish that he had devoted more than a paragraph to the important recent changes in New York and other state laws permitting the issue of stock without par value.\n\nThe fourth section entitled Internal Financial Management is the most illuminating in the book. While by no means all accountants would agree with those paragraphs expounding one or another of the various moot problems, still the discussions are all thoroughly sound, albeit savoring more of business expediency than the strict logic of accountancy. The two closing chapters, entitled Budgets and Financial Standards, are particularly suggestive. The subjects treated in the latter have wide economic significance, but the generalizations are somewhat superficial and backed by insufficient empirical evidence. The fifth part, entitled Financial Abuses and Involvements, is distinctly patchwork. It shows the marks of hasty preparation and is the least satisfactory section in the book.\n\nNumerous inaccuracies annoy the careful reader. For illustration, Lough speaks of the \"reorganization of the Erie Railroad in 1895\" (p. 142) and one is surprised to hear that there was issued at the time \"Erie Railroad first consolidated mortgage 7's 1920.\" The proof reading was not always careful; for illustration, 1889 should read 1899 (p. 171). These are small matters, but scientific accuracy of detail is very important in financial writings of lasting value. As a whole, the book shows a wide familiarity with current financial discussion and, above all, great sanity and good judgment. Teachers of corporation finance will find in it a very satisfactory text. From the pedagogical point of view it strikes the happy medium between unjustified generalities and a hopeless maze of detail.\n\nIn the 1930s Lough became an authority in the field of Consumer spending. A 1932 report of Retail Trade Board of the Boston Chamber of Commerce for example had noted that Lough had estimated a \"total retail sales of consumer goods amounted to about 19 billion dollars in 1914,\". while the National Bureau of Economic Research had \"estimated total retail sales as 22 billion dollars for that year.\"\n\nIn 1935 Lough with the assistance of Martin Gainsbrugh published \"High-Level Consumption,\" which is considered the first detailed estimates of aggregate consumer expenditures for goods and services in the United States over a period of time. This work was also noted as \"the only serious attempts to measure saving of individuals over several years by the balance sheet method.\" Their pioneer estimates covered the years 1909, 1914, 1919, 1921, 1923, 1925, 1927, 1929, and 1931. The data for the later years were revised and extended by Harold Barger, \"Outlay and Income in the United States, 1921-1938,\" National Bureau of Economic Research, New York, 1942. In the 1940s, J. Frederic Dewhurst and Associates (\"America’s Needs and Resources,\" 1947) revised these various estimates and expanded those on recreational expense to take account of estimates by Julius Weinberger, “The Economic Aspects of Recreation,” \"Harvard Business Review,\" summer issue, 1937.\n\nIn 1935, estimates of aggregate consumer expenditures in detail for 1909 and 1929 and selected years between were prepared by Martin Gainsbrugh and published in William H. Lough, \"HighLevel Consumption\"... This book included a comparison with The Brookings Institution’s aggregates for 1929, showing that the two estimates were very close for food expense, and reasonably close for attire and home maintenance; but the estimates by Lough and Gainsbrugh of expenditures for all other items were much higher than the Brookings’ figures.\n\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from \"Who's who in New York City and State,\" (1914), a 1910 review by M.
