Built in 1851, it was the site of the nation's first commodity futures exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977 in recognition of that function, and was designated a New York City Landmark in 1965.\n\n1 Hanover Square is located on the west side of the eponymous square in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. It is a three-story masonry structure, built out of brownstone in the Italian Renaissance style. The main facade is eight bays wide, with the main entrance occupying two bays at the center. Windows on the ground floor are tall, and set in openings flanked by paneled pilasters and topped by pedimented segmental arches. Second-floor windows are smaller, set beneath gabled pediments, and third floor windows are smaller still, with simpler surrounds. The building is crowned by a modillioned cornice.\n\nThe structure was constructed as a commercial investment by the builder, developer and merchant Richard F. Carman in 1851-53. It was the headquarters of the Hanover Bank. In 1870, the New York Cotton Exchange was founded here, the second such exchange in the world and the first exchange in the United States to deal in commodity futures (contracts specifying the delivery at a future date of a particular commodity).\n\nThe building served as the headquarters of W.R. Grace and Company from 1885 until 1913, when it was purchased by the India House, a private club for gentlemen involved in foreign commerce. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977. It currently houses restaurants. It was also used in the 2001 film \"Kate and Leopold\" as Leopold's family home.\n\n\n"}

It is located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, in the U.S. state of New York, and is being designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects.\n\nThe tower is located along Central Park South; when complete the building will have 70 floors, and will include 116 units. Completion is expected in 2018. Although a striking addition to the Midtown Manhattan skyline, it will nonetheless be dominated by the existing Central Park Tower. When completed, the tower will be the tenth-tallest building in New York City, slightly shorter than Four World Trade Center.\n\nThe building that previously occupied the site was a 20-story building built in 1954. It contained 124 apartments, and was purchased in 2005 by Vornado for $131.5 million. After the purchase, Vornado entered a legal battle with its rent-stabilized tenants concerning their eviction. A court sided with Vornado in 2009, and the developer ultimately settled with tenants in 2010, paying between $1.3 million and $1.56 million to those remaining in the building.\n\nDemolition of the existing structure began in 2012 after the settling of a dispute between Vornado and Extell. Extell, another developer, owned the parking garage under the previous building, and was unwilling to close it. Demolition was completed in early 2013. Robert A. M. Stern's designs were released in early 2014. The plans were approved in March 2014.\n\nThe building is one of several major developments on or around 57th Street and Central Park, dubbed “Billionaires Row” by the media, and buildings include 432 Park Avenue, 111 West 57th Street, The Steinway Tower, and the Central Park Tower.\n\nDesigns originally called for a \"glass\" tower. Contrary to the early plans, Robert A. M. Stern's designs call for a limestone-clad building, similar to other buildings by Stern such as 15 Central Park West. The building is one of three skyscrapers designed by Stern in Manhattan, joining 30 Park Place in the Financial District, and 520 Park Avenue, east of Central Park.\n\nThe building is currently under construction. In November 2016 Justin Casquejo, a thrill-seeking teenage free solo climber and stunt performer, hung from the not-yet-completed tower.\n\nThe building will have a porte-cochere, as well as a wine cellar, a swimming pool, a dining room, and a fitness room.\n\n"}

Even though the industry was on a very low level of development, the state was among the first 10 countries in the world which developed their own aircraft production. Originally, only the parts produced in foreign factories were assembled, but very soon the production of domestic components began, so as the engineering. The forerunner of the domestic aircraft industry was the Airplane workshop (\"Aeroplanska radionica\"), which was established in 1920, at the airfield in Novi Sad. The assembling of the trial series of Hansa-Brandenburg C.I. The series was named SBr, as this type of plane was known in Serbia as \"srednji Brandenburg\" (\"middle Brandenburg\").\n\nFrom 1923 to 1941, there were 7 aircraft factories in Serbia, 4 of which were located in the capital, Belgrade, and 2 airplane engines factories. Also, some planes were produced in the aircraft workshops, aero clubs and private workshops. There were also factories for the aircraft equipment and workshops for the repairs and overhauls of the aircraft, engines and components. A major boost to the industry was a decision by the state from 1926 to acquire over 800 fighters and several hundreds of trainers and school planes. Additional foreign licenses were obtained. The advance of the industry was halted in 1932 when the state stopped with the further acquirement of the aircraft due to the Great Depression. The production rebound from 1937 onwards.\n\nAccording to the State union of the aircraft industries of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the state's aircraft industry and the auxiliary industries employed 300 engineers and technicians, 500 employees and 6,000 workers. In total, 1,729 military and civilian aircraft were produced in Serbia between two World Wars. Of those, none were cargo or reconnaissance aircraft. One of the most important people in the technical development of the aircraft design was engineer Milenko Mitrović \"Spirta\", who developed numerous designs for the airplanes in the 1928-40 period.\n\nFirst proper factory was established on 20 November 1923 in Novi Sad. The driving force behind it foundation was Dimitrije Konjović (1888-1982), former pilot in the Austro-Hungary's air forces in World War I. He founded Ikarus together with brothers Dušan and Milivoj Kovačević and engineer . Jointly with the Rogožarski factory, founded a bit later, they were given a task of producing the trainer aircraft \"ŠB\" (\"školski Brandenburg\", literally \"school(ing) Brandenburg\"). In April 1924 first planes were delivered while in November 1924 the factory produced the first homemade aircraft as the company's designing bureau drafted the trainer flying boat \"ŠM\" (\"školski mornarički\", \"school naval (plane)\").\n\nIn 1927-28 Ikarus built new facilities in Zemun, equipped for the serial production of airplanes and its own airfield. By the end of 1932, the headquarters of the company also moved to Zemun. The production in Novi Sad was completely discontinued in 1932. In 1934 the town of Zemun was officially merged into Belgrade.\n\nIn the 1923-41 period, Ikarus produced a total of 441 aircraft. Some of the best aircraft produced in the factory include observation plane Potez XV, light bomber Bristol Blenheim and fighters Hawker Fury and Ikarus IK-2. It was the first company which began producing gliders, in 1928. They also constructed the first Serbian and Yugoslav fighter plane, completely domestically designed, IK-1, in 1935, designed by and .\n\nRight after occupying Yugoslavia, Germans commandeered the factory on 17 April 1941. The complex was heavily bombed during the massive Allied Easter bombing of Belgrade in April 1944. The facilities of Ikarus were almost completely destroyed during the war, but the factory was rebuilt. In 1946 Zmaj and Rogožarski were merged with the Ikarus, after previously being nationalized. In 1954 the company began producing buses and, starting from 1960, the production of aircraft was being shut down and relocated to the SOKO factory in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Production of the aircraft was completely discontinued in 1962 and, until that date, Ikarus produced a total of 475 planes after the war. The facilities were completely demolished and the area is today occupied by the residential buildings, stretching between the Hotel Jugoslavija on the east, and \"Palmira Toljatija\" Street (roughly blocks 9-A and 11-C. divided between the municipalities of Zemun and New Belgrade). The engineers and the design bureau were transferred to the Aeronautical Technical Institute in the Belgrade's suburb of Žarkovo. The company was ultimately renamed to Ikarbus.\n\nWell known aircraft constructed in Ikarus after the war include fighter Ikarus S-49, trainers Ikarus 213 and Ikarus 522, light reconnaissance-bomber Ikarus 214 and baby twin-jet Ikarus 452M.\n\nThe administrative building of the company, which was built in 1938 as part of the complex, as of 2018 is one of the oldest surviving buildings in New Belgrade. In June 2017 it was announced that the building will be demolished so that private investor can build a highrise instead. Locals organized in an effort to adapt the building into the museum instead. In 2018 Citizen protested, demolished the construction hoarding and physically prevented the investor to destroy the building, so police intervened. Investor then posted a board which showed that the original building will be preserved but vastly expanded and superstructured. Still, a heavy demolition machinery was brought so citizens protested again in March. Inheritors of the pre-World War II owners of the \"Ikarus\" company, which was nationalized after 1945, applied for the restitution. The administrative building of the former airplane factory was a symbol of the industrial development of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Apart from being one of the oldest preserved objects in New Belgrade, it was the only representative of the Art Deco in the municipality. Citizens proposed that the building might be adapted into the Museum of New Belgrade or a branch of the Museum of Aviation. The building was not protected by the law. Still, the building was demolished in July 2018.\n\nPredecessor of the company was the Rogožarski carpentry workshop. It worked on the repairs of the confiscated airplanes in the World War I. In April 1924 the \"First Serbian airplane factory Živojin Rogožarski\" was founded in Belgrade by Živojin Rogožarski. At first, worked jointly with Ikarus on \"ŠB\". Due to the major financial losses, the company was took over by the new owners in 1934. The Resavac and the Blagojević brothers transformed the company into the joint-stock company \"Rogožarski A.D. Beograd\" and the company was revived. It produced a total of 284 airplanes in the 1924-41 period, mostly designed locally.\n\nApart from the \"ŠB\", the best known aircraft manufactured in Rogožarski were trainers Fizir F1V and Rogožarski R-100, floatplane Rogožarski SIM-XIV-H and fighter Hawker Hurricane.\n\nRogožarski produced the IK-3 airplane, considered the finest Serbian fighter. It was a low-wing one-seat monoplane, constructed in 1936 by Ilić, Sivčev and Slobodan Zrnić. The prototype was finished in 1938 and the production began in 1940. Till the beginning of the World War II, in April 1941, only 12 airplanes were finished. Six were in service at 51st Independent Fighter Group of the 6th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which defended the capital Belgrade. They held their own against the Messerschmitt Bf 109 (Bf 109E) planes, during the German invasion. Three IK-3s were shot down, while 7 Messerschmitts were also gunned down and one was damaged. The three remaining IK-3s were destroyed by their crews on the ground, in order not to get captured by the advancing Germans.\n\nThe factory was located in the neighborhood of Palilula, bounded by the streets of \"Stanoja Glavaša\", \"Dalmatinska\", \"Starine Novaka\" and \"Kneza Danila\". The new Communist authorities nationalized the company, merged it into Ikarus in 1946, while the facilities were transformed into the IKL (ball bearing factory) in 1948. The complex was demolished and in 2015 construction of the residential and commercial neighborhood of \"Central Garden\" began, which should include the 16-storey \"Business Garden Tower\".\n\nIn 1927 the \"Zmaj\" factory was established in Zemun. Full name was \"Fabrika aeroplana i hidroplana - Zmaj, Petrović i Šterić\" (\"Airplane and flying boats factory Zmaj - Petrović & Šterić\"). From the early 1930s the factory began producing the state's first training planes, training flying boats and the trainer fighter aircraft, using French design. During the 1927-41 period, 126 licensed (foreign designed) planes were produced, with additional 220 locally designed ones.\n\nProduction of the locally designed planes began in 1932. The factory produced, among others, fighters Hawker Hurricane, Hawker Fury and Dewoitine D.27, trainer Zmaj Fizir FP-2, and passenger transporter Spartan Cruiser for the Aeroput Air Traffic Society, the first air traffic company in Serbia and precursor of the modern Air Serbia.\n\nAfter 1946, the company was adapted for the production of the agricultural machines, while the aircraft section was merged into Ikarus.\n\nIn 1924 the Air Force decided to build an aircraft factory for its own needs, deep inside the state's territory. In September 1926, on the Divlje Polje locality near Kraljevo, construction of the new plant for the construction and repair of the aircraft began, which was finished in 1927. According to the contract with the government, it was soon taken over by the French Breguet Aviation company, which used it for the production of the Breguet 19 airplane type. The factory was officially called \"Breguet Aeroplanska radionica u Kraljevu\" (\"Breguet airplane workshop in Kraljevo\"), but was colloquially known as FAK (\"Fabrika aviona Kraljevo\", \"Kraljevo airplane factory\"). Production of Breguet 19 began in 1928 and 470 units were made, more planes than any other factory in this period. The production was halted in 1933 when the contract expired and the French withdrew from the business. Air and Technics Institute in Kraljevo (VTZ, \"Vazduhoplovno-tehnički zavod\"), took over the premises. In this period repairs were conducted and the spare parts were produced.\n\nProduction was revitalized in 1939 when the State airplane factory (DFA, \"Državna fabrika aviona\") was founded. The production included the modern and more complex two-engine bombers Dornier Do 17K, on the German license. During the Kraljevo massacre in October 1941, among over 2,000 victims executed by the occupational German forces, there were 473 employees of the factory.\n\nDuring the withdrawal in front of the invading German army, Royal Yugoslav Army destroyed the most vital parts of the plant and the Germans never managed to repair it, though they used it for occasional repairs of the Breguet and Dornier planes. Those little remaining machines and equipment which survived were dismantled in 1942 and transported to Germany. After the war, authorities didn't try to restore the plant, instead, what remained of it was attached to the \"Kraljevo railway wagon factory\" (FVK, \"Fabrika vagona Kraljevo\").\n\nThe Glider Union \"Utva\" (\"Jedriličarska zadruga \"Utva\"\") was founded on 5 June 1937, also in Zemun. It produced only gliders until 1939 when it was transformed into the full aircraft factory \"Utva\" AD. In 1940 the factory was relocated to Pančevo where the German licensed Bücker Bü 131 (Bücker Jungmann) training aircraft were assembled. In Pančevo factory had its own airfield.\n\nThe pre-war gliders included Šoštarić Vrabac (designed by Ivo Šoštarić) and . A total of 39 gliders and 148 Bücker Jungmanns were constructed prior to 1941. As the factory was damaged during the war, it was rebuilt in the 1944-46 period and with Ikarus, to which Zmaj and Rogožanski were attached, became the main force in the aircraft industry.\n\nUtva was restarted as a repair workshop and an airplane equipment factory, before resuming the aircraft production in 1948, though it continued to make parts and equipment for other aircraft producing companies, even from the abroad. The company is primarily known for its trainers. The best known plane types include Utva Trojka, Utva 212, Utva 213 Vihor, Utva-65, Utva 66 and UTVA 75, so as the components for Soko J-22 Orao and Soko G-4 Super Galeb. In total, the company constructed over 900 aircraft. One of the newer models is a trainer Lasta 95.\n\nIn May 1996, the Lola Institute from the Belgrade's suburb of Železnik, merged with Utva into the Utva-Lola company. The factory was bombed on several occasions during the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 and was damaged a lot. The complex was partially reconstructed. In 2017 the state-owned company Yugoimport SDPR, which deals with the arms and the defense-related equipment, took over 96% of the shares of Utva-Lola.\n\nThe company, now called \"Utva avio-industrija\" remained in a dire financial situation. The company's bank account remained blocked, there were no promised investments and 10% of the workforce was fired. As of August 2018, representatives of the company's trade union claimed that the factory \"is not capable of producing aircraft anymore\". However, the company presented its new plane that same month, the training aircraft \"Sova\", actually a rehashed UTVA 75 with the \"Garmin\" avionics, which prompted public questions how acceptable is it to keep Utva \"alive\" at all.\n\nThe company was founded by Nestor Slepčev, who originally designed aircraft in Australia, but after 1999 moved the production to Čenej, close to Novi Sad. It is producing Slepcev Storch, a 3/4 scale ultra-light replica of the German Fieseler Fi 156 Storch from World War II. It is a two-seated plane, made of chromium and molybdenum, and produced in three versions, one of which is a four-seated and the other can land on the water. The planes are quite popular, being exported into 50 states.\n\nA company specialized in the production of the light and ultra-light aircraft. It was founded in 2006 in Kraljevo, close to the location of the pre-war aircraft factory. It produces licensed Colombian AeroAndina aircraft (Kimbaya, Embera, Tumaco and Tyrona). As with the other ultra light aircraft, they are made from chrome and molybdenum.\n\nIn 2013 the company produced its own design, the Aero East Europe Sila ultra-light aircraft. There are several versions: Sila 450 C, Sila 750 C cruiser models, Sila 750 S STOL, the three-seat Sila 750 MT medical transport and the four-seat Sila 950. DEsign was developed in cooperation with the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Belgrade. Apart from manufacturing, the company also maintains and repairs aircraft and aircraft engines.\n\nThe two remaining interwar factories were \"Vlajković\", in Belgrade, and \"Albatros\", in Sremska Mitrovica.\n\nIn the workshops of the Aeroput, a three-seat twin-engine Aeroput MMS-3, or Mitrović MMS-3 was constructed in 1936. It was made for the company's air taxi service.\n\nThe \"IAM\" and \"Vlajković-Walter\" factories produced airplane engines and both were located in the Belgrade's industrialized suburb of Rakovica.\n\n\"IAM\" (\"Airplane engines industry\", \"Industrija aeroplanskih motora A.D.\") was founded in 1927. It was 50% owned by the foreign investors until 1936 when it was nationalized. It produced licensed plane engins: Gnome-Rhône Jupiter, Gnome-Rhône 7K, Gnome-Rhône 9K, Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major. In 1940, assembling of the Praga trucks began. After the war, IAM became IMR, \"Industrija Motora Rakovica\", one of the largest factory in general in Yugoslavia. One section within the IMR continued to manufacture and repair aircraft engines, though it was best known for the production of tractors. By the 2010s barely operational, it went bankrupt in 2017.\n\nAircraft engines factory \"S.Vlajković and Sons\" originated as the carpentry workshop in 1925, founded by Svetozar Vlajković. The shop, located in the neighborhood of Dorćol, repaired Breguet XIV aircraft and its engines. The factory then moved to Rakovica and started the production of the Walter NZ engines. In 1948 it was transformed into the factory which, among other products, made aircraft engines, starting with the piston engines, but sine the late 1950s including the licensed jet engine Astazou XIV M1 for the Aérospatiale Gazelle helicopters and parts for the jet engines Viper 632-41, 632-46 and 636-41. It also produced other special helicopter parts, like the rotor hubs and transmissions. IMR obtained a General Motors license to repair their engines while in the 1980s it produced engine parts for Boeing and Tupolev. With decline since the 1990s, it mostly performed repairs of helicopter parts. Bankruptcy proceedings started in 2016.\n\n\"\", the first factory which dealt with the telephony, optics and precision mechanics, was founded in 1922 in Dorćol. Production of the aircraft instruments, coolers and other equipment began in 1928. Originally, all products were foreign licenses, but from 1935 the company began designing the equipment. In 1940, the factory moved to Zemun where and continued to produce some of the aircraft products. It went bankrupt in 2007, but the optics section survived as Teleoptik-Žiroskopi.\n\n\"Prospekt Nestor\", another precise mechanics plant, was open in 1938 in the Belgrade's neighborhood of Lion. It produced military equipment, but also some aircraft equipment. After the war it was nationalized, transformed into the \"Precizna mehanika\" and moved to the neighborhood of Učiteljsko Naselje. Though not officially bankrupt, especially after the botched privatization in 2007, \"Precizna mehanika\" is out of business.\n\nAnother producer of the aircraft instruments was the optics and precision mechanics company \"Mikron\", in the Belgrade's neighborhood of Krunski Venac. They also tested and adjusted optical instruments. In 1947 it was annexed to the \"Nikola Tesla elektronska industrija\" factory which switched to the production of the home appliances. It was privatized in 2006 and is effectively out of business.\n\n\"Prospekt Jasenica\" was the first factory to produce the licensed spark plugs. They also repaired the Breguet 19 Lorraine aircraft engines. The offices were in Zemun, but the factory was in the town of Smederevska Palanka. After the war, the factory became the core of the \"Goša\" factory, which switched to the rail wagons production, and went bankrupt in 2018.\n\nThe \"Knebl and Dietrich\" factory was founded in the town of Inđija in 1923, as the \"factory of flying equipment, parachutes and leather suits\". Production of parachutes began in 1934, originally under the license from the US Irvin Airchute Company. Co-owner Miroslav Dietrich designed first Serbian parachute, \"Spas\", in 1930, but the production started after the US licensed ones. Until 1941, the company produced 2,500 parachutes. The company was nationalized in 1947, renamed \"Franjo Kluz\" and moved to Belgrade. The production diversified, including sports, military, landing, training, pilot, emergency, brake, cargo and other special parachutes, overalls, suits, armor vests, paragliders and other special equipment, overalls, suits, etc. By 2007, over 200.000 parachutes were produced and exported, while additional 55,000 were produced for domestic use, both military and civilian. The company was divided in several parts which mostly went bankrupt, but \"Kluz padobrani\", which handled the parachutes production was privatized in 2006. Since 2007/08 the production was restored in cooperation with the German company Brüggemann.\n\nThe origins of the Aircraft Institute \"Moma Stanojlović\" (\"Vazduhoplovni zavod Moma Stanojlović\") predate the World War II. Founded in 1949 as the workshop for the repairs of the aircraft engines, the Aircraft Institute \"Moma Stanojlović\" (\"Vazduhoplovni zavod Moma Stanojlović\") was enlarged in 1952 into the major overhaul facility. It was seated in the Belgrade's suburb of Kneževac. In 1971 it merged with another repair facility \"Jastreb\" from Zemun. The current name of the company was adopted in 1976 and in 1977 it moved to the Batajnica Airport. The institute overhauled sub-sonic and supersonic aircraft, like MiG-21, Soko J-22 Orao, Soko G-2 Galeb, Soko G-4 Super Galeb, Soko J-21 Jastreb, Antonov An-2, Antonov An-26, Canadairs, Utva, Zlin and helicopters like Gazelle, Aérospatiale Alouette, Mil Mi-2, Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-17. It also repaired pistons, propellers and free turbine engines. It also repaired and maintained radio-navigational equipment, flying and photo equipment. The institute also produced large number of parts and equipment. It was damaged during the 1999 NATO bombing. In cooperation with the Aeronautical Technical Institute, it developed the prototype of the Vrabac Mini UAV mini drone.\n\nThe Mihajlo Pupin Institute, founded in 1946 in Belgrade for development of computer systems, automation, robotics and telecommunications, designed and constructed various aviation projects: flying simulators for the pilots training, simulators for training of the anti-aircraft artillerymen, visual systems for the simulators, systems for detection of radar emitters, etc. The institute is located in the Zvezdara Forest.\n\nThe Aeronautical Technical Institute was founded in 1946. It was a research and developing institute, connected with the flight department of the School of Mechanical Engineering in Belgrade, but administered by the Yugoslav army. It was focused on the research, development and design of the aerodynamics, flight mechanics, structures, stability, aircraft structures, propulsion, etc. The facilities of the institute, which include subsonic and transonic wind tunnels, are located in Žarkovo. In 1992 the institute was administratively abolished and attached to the Military Technical Institute Belgrade.\n\n\"Minel Inženjering Eving\" is part of the Minel Concern, founded in 1948. It is focused on the electric energy and flight engineering. In 2013 it was given a task of reconstructing and upgrading aircraft platforms and parking spaces of the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport.\n\n\"Aeroinžinjering\" company, founded by professor Aleksandar Patrnogić (1923-2012), since the early 1980s worked, through consulting and engineering, on the founding of the airports and air bases abroad, including the original ideas, maintenance, supply and servicing of the equipment. It went bankrupt in 2010.\n\n"}

Strictly speaking the term applies to speculators who borrow money to fund such a purchase, and are thus under great pressure to complete the transaction before the loan is repayable or the seller of the stock demands payment on settlement day for delivery of the bargain. If the value of the stock falls contrary to his expectation, a bull suffers a loss, frequently very large if he is trading on margin. A bull has a great incentive to \"talk-up\" the value of his stock or to manipulate the market in his stock, for example by spreading false rumour, to procure a buyer or to cause a temporary price increase which will provide him with the selling opportunity and profit he requires. A bull must therefore be contrasted with an investor, who purchases a stock in expectation of a medium-term (say 5 years) or long-term increase in value due to the underlying performance of the company and its assets. The speculator who takes a directly opposite view to the bull is the bear, who speculates on a stock decreasing in value, having sold short. A bull market is a period during which stock market prices rise over a sustained period, therefore to the advantage of bulls.\n\nAn early mention of the terms bull and bear appears in the 1769 edition of Thomas Mortimer's \"Every Man his own Broker\", published in London, as follows, relating to speculators operating in Jonathan's Coffee-House in Exchange Alley (the original London proto-Stock Exchange):\n\nThis refers to the former practice of stock-brokers, abolished circa 1980's in London, allowing their clients to trade on credit during a period of about two weeks, known as an account, on the completion of which all purchases and sales made during the account period had to be paid for on the settlement date. A net trading loss would result in the client having to make a cash payment to the broker.\n\nIn early usage the terms bull and bear were akin to naming a variety of fraudster, as is made clear by Mortimer, writing about 40 years after the scandal of the South Sea Bubble:\n\nMortimer gives an example of a bull as follows:\n\nSeveral bronze statues of bulls representing positive investor sentiment exist near the locations of several stock markets or brokerage houses, for example:\n\n"}

Typical business hours vary widely by country. By observing common informal standards for business hours, workers may communicate with each other more easily and find a convenient divide between work life and home life.\n\nIn the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia, the hours between 9 am and 5 pm (the traditional \"9 to 5\") are typically considered to be standard business hours, although in the United States this varies by region due to local tradition and the need to conduct business by telephone with people in other time zones. For instance, business in Chicago is often conducted between 8 am and 4:30 pm, while in New York City, business hours tend to be later—for instance, from 10 am to 6 pm. On Saturdays, businesses are usually open from 8 or 9 am to noon or 1 pm.\n\nIn Mexico, the standard business hours are from 7 am to 2 pm and 4 pm to 6 pm.\n\nIn Finland, government agencies and other institutions follow the hours 8:00am to 4:15pm. Banks are usually open to 4:30pm. Common business is done from Monday to Friday, but major shops are usually open on Saturdays 9:00am – 6:00pm and on Sundays 12:00pm – 9:00pm, with exceptions.\n\nOther countries have different business hour patterns. Many workers in warmer climates observe Siesta during the afternoon, between the hours of 2 pm and 5 pm, effecting a pause in business hours, and resuming business in the evenings. La Siesta is a Spanish language term, which literally translates as a short nap of 15–30 minutes.\n\nBusiness hours usually occur on weekdays. However, the days of the week on which business is conducted also varies from region to region in the world.\n\nMany businesses and organizations have extended or unlimited business hours if their business takes place continuously. For example, hotels, airports, and hospitals are open 24 hours a day, and transactions can take place at any point in time, thus requiring staffing and management availability at all times.\nRecent communications technology such as smartphones has also extended the working day.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, legislation or regulations may require businesses to limit their trading hours. For example, some Western countries prohibit certain businesses from trading on Sundays, this being traditionally considered a day of rest. Businesses which serve hot food or alcoholic drinks are also frequently restricted in their trading hours.\n\nIn the United States, the U.S. Department of Labor has mandated that companies must pay overtime to individuals who work over 40 hours a week. Businesses often do not schedule their employees to work more than 40 hours per week because they want to avoid paying their employees overtime.\n\nIn Greece, business hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are usually from 9 am to 3 pm, while on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays are usually from 9 am to 2 pm and after the siesta from 5.30 pm to 9 pm. Large stores and supermarkets follow an extended business hours schedule and are open Monday to Friday from 9 am to 9 pm and on Saturdays from 9 am to 8 pm. All stores are normally closed on Sundays, but there are several exceptions throughout the year. Banking and civil services hours are usually Monday to Friday from 8 am to 2 pm, with minor variations but are always closed at weekends. All stores and offices are closed on public holidays.\n"}

{"id": "51056450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51056450", "title": "Composition-Based View", "text": "Composition-Based View\n\nThe composition-based view (CBV) was recently developed by Luo and Child (2015). It is a new theory that explicates the growth of firms without the benefit of resource advantages, proprietary technology, or market power. The CBV complements some existing theories such as resource-based view (RBV), resource management view, and dynamic capability – to create novel insights into the survival of firms that do not possess such strategic assets as original technologies and brands. It emphasizes how ordinary firms with ordinary resources may generate extraordinary results through their creative use of open resources and unique integrating capabilities, resulting in an enhanced speed and a high price-value ratio that are well suited to large numbers of low- to mid-end mass market consumers. The CBV has been commented as “a new view with significant application” for emerging market firms and for small and medium sized enterprises in many countries. The view cautions though that composition-generated advantages are temporary in nature and that composition itself mandates special skills in distinctively identifying, leveraging, and combining open or existing resources inside and outside the firm.\n\nAccording to Luo and Child (2015), the term “composition” refers to the identification, configuration, and integration of (a) different sources of resources (e.g., acquiring applied technology and key components through licensing or purchasing, which are then further integrated with in-house production) and (b) different means of competition (e.g., price, value, design, technology, features, and services) to create a competitive advantage manifested in extended offerings (e.g., new product functions, extended consumer experience, and total business solutions), rapid market responses, and superior price-value ratios that suit particularly well the mass market.\n\nThere are three important concepts or notions that constitute composition. First, \"Compositional Offering\" – the firm uses open or available resources to provide customers with amalgamated values, services, and convenience at a reduced cost. It occurs when the firm extends product features, functions and services for customers who not only look for high value-price ratio but also total solutions, one-shop-for-all convenience, and amalgamated functions or services in a single product. Fast-paced life style, along with the expansion of middle-class consumers and digitization-based new consumerism, prompts the need for compositional offering.\n\nSecond, \"Compositional Competition\" – the firm combines and integrates different means of competition (e.g., quick responsiveness, low cost, new functions and features, customer-focused design, and extended warranty) to win competition. Compositional competition combines low cost, speed and quality means, providing customers with quick market responses and high price-value ratio. Compositional competitors deliver suitable technology at a low cost by leveraging mature technologies or R&D resources and by using open architecture or platforms that can significantly reduce production costs. These firms are astute in business intelligence involving both markets and technologies. \nThird, \"Compositional Capability\" – the firm’s ability to bundle different resources and competitive attributes to create a certain competitive advantage. It shifts a focus from developing new resources to bundling existing resources, including those accessible from domestic or global open markets, as well as bundling competitive attributes such as quality, features, price, speed, innovation, design, and services. Entrepreneurial vision, market intelligence, absorptive capacity, and combinative capability are essential to accomplishing compositional capability.\n\nAccording to Luo and Child (2015), compositional capability serves as the foundation on which compositional competition and compositional offering can build and forge ahead. This foundation determines how far the firm can go in adopting composition-based strategy. While compositional competition manifests the firm’s business-level strategy, focusing on the logic of using compositional building blocks for achieving a competitive edge, compositional offering expresses the firm’s operational-level strategy, pinpointing the value offering propensity (e.g., total solutions, one-stop services, or integrated functions) in a cost-effective manner. The above three elements reinforce one another, reflecting the faces of composition at the product level (compositional offering), market level (compositional competition), and organizational level (compositional capability). Yet, they collectively demonstrate a pragmatic and viable solution for the growth of ordinary firms that possess ordinary resources.\n\nThe CBV argues that firms with ordinary resources can establish some competitive position, at least temporarily, by creatively assembling and integrating the open and generic resources they possess or purchase. The term ‘ordinary resources’ refers to resources that are neither idiosyncratic nor costly to copy, and that can be purchased in an open market or secured from partner firms. The CBV informs the ways in which ordinary firms can survive by creatively using and bundling ordinary resources. CBV changes the view from developing and leveraging distinctive resources to distinctively using generic and open resources that are available. It is essentially a compensational remedy and a catch-up strategy for these companies in their efforts to compete against resourceful and powerful rivals equipped with strategic assets. Composition is a deliberate, intelligent, and pragmatic approach, offsetting these firms’ competitive weaknesses, yet requiring savvy organizational skills to achieve compositional advantages.\n\nWhile the CBV logic applies to any firm endeavoring to catch up with better endowed competitors, it aligns well with the case of emerging economies enterprises and small- and medium-sized enterprises in developed or developing countries. There are several external conditions that provoke the adoption of composition-based strategy, including:\n\nThe composition-based strategy is achieved through the compositional process, which relies on the recognition and management of interdependencies, both inside the firm and with external network partners. Compositional process entails a set of key process capabilities, including:\n\nThe RBV argues that resources that are rare, valuable, inimitable, and non-substitutable are considered to be the source of sustained competitive advantage. The CBV complements with the RBV in that it does not emphasize possession of superior strategic resources as a necessary condition for the firm’s competitive advantage. Instead, the CBV underscores the use of multiple sources of open or generic resources – resources which when used in a creative composition may yield a competitive edge to the firm, at least temporarily. Also, the CBV points out that composition process is a distinct competence and critical capability that is valuable, heterogeneous, and not always easy to imitate.\n\nResource management is the comprehensive process of structuring the firm’s resource portfolio, bundling the resources to build capabilities, and leveraging those capabilities with the purpose of creating and maintaining value for customers and owners. However, in the resource management literature, the bundling process deals with internal or existing resources, the CBV extends this view by considering the composition of external open resources.\n\nConsistent with the dynamic capability perspective, the composition process itself is a distinctive, firm-specific, and dynamic capability, that is, “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competence to address rapidly changing environments”. While the dynamic capability perspective assumes that executives need to engage in resource adaptation or renewal because the value of existing resources depreciates in the light of external changes, the CBV focuses on the competitive advantage that can be gained from combining existing resources in novel ways.\n\nAccording to Luo and Child (2015), there exist several limitations of the composition-based strategy:\n\n"}

The EUR.1 is most importantly recognized as a certificate of origin in the external trade in legal sense, especially within the framework of several bi- and multilateral agreements of the Pan-European preference system (the European Union Association Agreement).\n\nEach free trade agreement (bi- and multi-lateral) states which products are covered, and which ones can benefit from lower (or none) rates of duty. The condition of \"origin\" is that the products must have been completely manufactured, processed or transformed in a member country.\n\nThe applicant for the EUR.1 (the exporter) must be able to prove the origin of the goods, which is usually done via presentation of the supplier invoice stating the product origin. This is called the supplier's declaration (SD). The exporter then fills in the EUR.1 application form, and hands it over to the competent authorities (usually the customs office) along with the supplier's invoice. The authorities certify the form with a stamp and send it back to the exporter.\n\nThe EUR.1 is used to certify the origin of a product, and if applicable, benefit from favorable trade terms (tariffs mainly) under a preferential trade policy of the EU.\n\nIn order to benefit from the preferential rate during a customs clearance, a valid EUR.1 movement certificate must be handed over to the competent authority (likely a customs office), in which the manufacturer certifies the origin of the goods.\n\nIn place of a movement certificate, a simple declaration of origin on the invoice can be provided by the manufacturer or sender of the goods in place of a proper movement certificate: this is called an invoice declaration.

{"id": "2460491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2460491", "title": "Financial risk", "text": "Financial risk\n\nFinancial risk is any of various types of risk associated with financing, including financial transactions that include company loans in risk of default. Often it is understood to include only downside risk, meaning the potential for financial loss and uncertainty about its extent.\n\nA science has evolved around managing market and financial risk under the general title of modern portfolio theory initiated by Dr. Harry Markowitz in 1952 with his article, \"Portfolio Selection\". In modern portfolio theory, the variance (or standard deviation) of a portfolio is used as the definition of risk.\n\nAsset-backed risk is the risk that changes in one or more assets that support an asset-backed security will significantly impact the value of the supported security. Risks include interest rate, term modification, and prepayment risk.\n\nCredit risk, also called \"default risk\", is the risk associated with a borrower going into default (not making payments as promised). Investor losses include lost principal and interest, decreased cash flow, and increased collection costs. An investor can also assume credit risk through direct or indirect use of leverage. For example, an investor may purchase an investment using margin. Or an investment may directly or indirectly use or rely on repo, forward commitment, or derivative instruments.\n\nForeign investment risk is the risk of rapid and extreme changes in value due to: smaller markets; differing accounting, reporting, or auditing standards; nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation; economic conflict; or political or diplomatic changes. Valuation, liquidity, and regulatory issues may also add to foreign investment risk.\n\nThis is the risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss (or make the required profit). There are two types of liquidity risk:\n\nThe four standard market risk factors are equity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, and commodity risk:\n\nOperational risk means the risk that a company or individual has to face due their own operation and decisions made for the investment\n\n\nFinancial risk, market risk, and even inflation risk can at least partially be moderated by forms of diversification.\n\nThe returns from different assets are highly unlikely to be perfectly correlated and the correlation may sometimes be negative. For instance, an increase in the price of oil will often favour a company that produces it, but negatively impact the business of a firm such an airline whose variable costs are heavily based upon fuel.\nHowever, share prices are driven by many factors, such as the general health of the economy which will increase the correlation and reduce the benefit of diversification.\nIf one constructs a portfolio by including a wide variety of equities, it will tend to exhibit the same risk and return characteristics as the market as a whole, which many investors see as an attractive prospect, so that index funds have been developed that invest in equities in proportion to the weighting they have in some well-known index such as the FTSE.\n\nHowever, history shows that even over substantial periods of time there is a wide range of returns that an index fund may experience; so an index fund by itself is not \"fully diversified\". Greater diversification can be obtained by diversifying across asset classes; for instance a portfolio of many bonds and many equities can be constructed in order to further narrow the dispersion of possible portfolio outcomes.\n\nA key issue in diversification is the correlation between assets, the benefits increasing with lower correlation. However this is not an observable quantity, since the future return on any asset can never be known with complete certainty. This was a serious issue in the late-2000s recession when assets that had previously had small or even negative correlations suddenly starting moving in the same direction causing severe financial stress to market participants who had believed that their diversification would protect them against any plausible market conditions, including funds that had been explicitly set up to avoid being affected in this way.\n\nDiversification has costs. Correlations must be identified and understood, and since they are not constant it may be necessary to rebalance the portfolio which incurs transaction costs due to buying and selling assets. \nThere is also the risk that as an investor or fund manager diversifies, their ability to monitor and understand the assets may decline leading to the possibility of losses due to poor decisions or unforeseen correlations.\n\nHedging is a method for reducing risk where a combination of assets are selected to offset the movements of each other.\nFor instance, when investing in a stock it is possible to buy an option to sell that stock at a defined price at some point in the future. The combined portfolio of stock and option is now much less likely to move below a given value. As in diversification there is a cost, this time in buying the option for which there is a premium. Derivatives are used extensively to mitigate many types of risk.\n\nACPM - Active credit portfolio management\n\nEAD - Exposure at default\n\nEL - Expected loss\n\nLGD - Loss given default\n\nPD - Probability of default\n\nKMV - quantitative credit analysis solution developed by credit rating agency Moody's\n\nVaR - Value at Risk, a common methodology for measuring risk due to market movements\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10377480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10377480", "title": "Fusion splicing", "text": "Fusion splicing\n\nFusion splicing is the act of joining two optical fibers end-to-end using heat. The goal is to fuse the two fibers together in such a way that light passing through the fibers is not scattered or reflected back by the splice, and so that the splice and the region surrounding it are almost as strong as the intact fiber. The source of heat is usually an electric arc, but can also be a laser, or a gas flame, or a tungsten filament through which current is passed.\n\nThe process of fusion splicing normally involves heat to melt or fuse the ends of two optical fibers together. The splicing process begins by preparing each fiber end for fusion.\n\nStripping is the act of removing the protective polymer coating around optical fiber in preparation for fusion splicing. The splicing process begins by preparing both fiber ends for fusion, which requires that all protective coating is removed or stripped from the ends of each fiber.\n\nFiber optical stripping is usually carried out by simply passing the fiber through a mechanical stripping device similar to a wire-stripper. Otherwise, a special stripping and preparation unit that uses hot sulphuric acid or a controlled flow of hot air is used to remove the coating. Under a process patented by Edward J Forrest, Jr (7,125,494) and assigned to Illinois Tool Works, Glenview, Illinois, there is a timed chemical removal process that does not require use of hot sulphuric acid or hot air. The process is patented as a \"solvent capture method\" primarily conceived to remove the \"matrix\" that holds individual fibers and creates a \"ribbon fiber\". This same procedure can be \"timed\" to remove not only matrix, but also coatings and claddings.\nCleaning the stripping and cleaving tools is also important.\n\nThe customary means to clean bare fibers is with alcohol and wipes. However, high purity isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is hygroscopic: it attracts moisture to itself. This is problematic as IPA is either procured in pre-saturated wiper format or in (host) containers ranging for USA quart to gallon to drums. From the host container the IPA is transferred to smaller more usable containers. The hydroscopic nature of IPA is such that the highest quality at 99.9% is also the most hygroscopic. This means that moisture absorption into both the host container as well as the actual user's container begins with the time the original container is opened and continues as amounts are transferred and removed from both. A 2003 laboratory study by ITW Chemtronics noted that 99.9% IPA began to absorb moisture (at 72F and 65% Relative Humidity) within fifteen minutes. Since there is no provision to deter this, this unique quality of IPA makes it less desirable than chemicals such as HFE-7100 based products or precision hydrocarbons. There is work being done to qualify aqueous based cleaners for this application.\n\nThe fiber is then cleaved using the score-and-break method so that its end-face is perfectly flat and perpendicular to the axis of the fiber. The quality of each fiber end is inspected using a microscope. In fusion splicing, splice loss is a direct function of the angles and quality of the two fiber-end faces. The closer to 90 degrees the cleave angle is the lower optical loss the splice will yield. The quality of the cleave tool being used is critical.\n\nCurrent fusion splicers are either core or cladding alignment. Using one of these methods the two cleaved fibers are automatically aligned by the fusion splicer in the x,y,z plane, then are fused together. Prior to the removal of the spliced fiber from the fusion splicer, a proof-test is performed to ensure that the splice is strong enough to survive handling, packaging and extended use. The bare fiber area is protected either by recoating or with a splice protector. A splice protector is a heat shrinkable tube with a strength membrane and less loss.\n\nA simplified optical splicing procedure includes:\n\nThe basic fusion splicing apparatus consists of two fixtures on which the fibres are mounted and two electrodes. These fixtures are often called sheath clamps. Inspection microscope assists in the placement of the prepared fiber ends into a fusion-splicing apparatus. The fibres are placed into the apparatus, aligned, and then fused together. Initially, fusion splicing used nichrome wire as the heating element to melt or fuse fibers together. New fusion-splicing techniques have replaced the nichrome wire with carbon dioxide (CO) lasers, electric arcs, or gas flames to heat the fiber ends, causing them to fuse together. The small size of the fusion splice and the development of automated fusion-splicing machines have made electric arc fusion (arc fusion) one of the most popular splicing techniques in commercial applications.\n\nAlternatives to fusion splicing include using optical fiber connectors or mechanical splices both of which have higher insertion losses, lower reliability and higher return losses than fusion splicing.\n\nANSI/EIA/TIA-455\n\n\nMethods of Removing Matrix from Fiber Optic Cable\" Patent 7,125,494\n\n\"How to Precision Clean All Fiber Optic Connections\": Edward J.

Ludington was promoted to Colonel and became an aide-de-camp to General George Washington in providing spies for espionage. He was associated with John Jay in a ring of spies. His daughter Sybil Ludington is well known to historians for her role in the American Revolution in helping the cause for independence by undertaking a nighttime horseback ride similar to that done by the patriot Paul Revere to alert the colonial militia to the approach of British forces.\n\nLudington's descendants have continued his legacy in several states besides New York, including Wisconsin and Michigan. Some became leaders in their own right and others were involved in developing towns.\n\nLudington's great-great-grandfather William Ludington (b. 1608) and his wife Ellen (b. 1617) were of English origin. Their places of birth in England are unknown. They were married in England in 1636. A few years later they immigrated to America. William and Ellen moved permanently to Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1640 and raised seven children (one had been born in England). William and his wife are the founders of the Ludington family in America and many of their descendants are in the Eastern United States. William and Ellen moved to New Haven, Connecticut, about 1660. It is recorded by 20th-century historian Louis S. Patrick that William died in 1663 at East Haven. By other historians his death is recorded as occurring in 1662. The difference in dating is due to the use the Julian Calendar in the mid-18th century in the Thirteen Colonies in America.\n\nThe sixth child of William, founder of the American Ludingtons, was another William Ludington (second in family) who was born about 1655 (died 1737). His first wife was Martha Rose and they had two sons and a daughter. Their first child was a Henry Ludington, who was born in 1679. The second child of this Henry Ludington was still another William Ludington, born in Branford, Connecticut, on September 6, 1702. He married Mary Knowles November 5, 1730, and they had eight children. Their third child was named Henry Ludington; his uncles were patriots and fought in one way or another for American independence.\n\nHenry Ludington was born May 25, 1739, in Branford, Connecticut. He had two older sisters, Submit and Mary, and five younger siblings, Lydia, Samuel, Rebecca, Anne, and Stephen. Not all survived to adulthood.\n\nLudington was schooled as a child in Branford typical to that of schooling in colonial towns of the 18th century. The school was controlled by the local Christian church and provided minimal basic education. Ludington was not interested in scholarly studies, but thought in terms of action instead. Ludington decided to discover the world and never completed his schooling.\n\nLudington enlisted in the local military in September 1755, at the age of sixteen. He was with Captain Foote's company of the Second Connecticut Regiment. Historian Louis S. Patrick says that Ludington re-enlisted on April 19, 1756, served under Colonel Andrew Ward at Crown Point, and was discharged on November 13, 1756. He was called back again for fifteen days of service at a \"general alarm\" for the relief of Fort William Henry in August 1757. He re-enlisted on April 14, 1759, for the\ncampaign of the Second Connecticut Regiment under Colonel Nathan Whiting and was a member of David Baldwin's Third Company.\n\nLudington marched with the British and American troops to Canada and participated in the victory at Quebec on September 13, 1759. He was entrusted at the age of twenty with being in charge of a company of sixty wounded soldiers who returned to New England. The arduous journey was made from Quebec to Boston in the infamous winter of 1759–60. Even though there were many hardships Ludington got his disabled comrades home safely. He then proceeded from Boston to Branford, Connecticut, in the spring of 1760 and retired from his military career. He returned to civilian life and married his cousin Abigail on May 1, 1760. She was born on May 8, 1745, so was just turning fifteen. They had twelve children, all born in Kent, New York (then known as Fredericksburgh).\n\nLudington received from King George II the promotion of lieutenant in the British Colonial Army as an accolade in recognition of his services. He held that position until he heard of the \"Duties in American Colonies Stamp Act\", when he resigned in protest. Ludington then accepted on February 13, 1773, a captain's commission from William Tryon, the last British governor of New York. He held that position until the beginning of the American Revolution. Ludington then was the commander of the 7th regiment (infantry) of \"Dutchess County\" in New York in the Battle of Ridgefield in April 1777, of the American Revolutionary War. The volunteers were mostly from the towns of Kent and Carmel of that county (later Putman County).\n\nLudington was affiliated with George Washington as an aide-de-camp. He worked with Washington and helped establish the initial \"secret service\" in America. Washington, in his campaign for American independence, conceived the idea of gathering patriots in a secret service of espionage to gather information on British troops and their activities so he could gain an advantage in his military movements. He sent a letter on February 4, 1777, to the military commander Nathaniel Sackett for assistance on this. Sackett in turn then delivered a letter ten days later to Ludington asking for help to furnish spies in Dutchess County and Westchester County in the New York province to gather information on British activities.\n\nAmong the first spies Ludington collaborated with was Enoch Crosby. Crosby was an American Revolutionary War soldier and worked in the territory where Ludington commanded troops. Crosby was a shoemaker by trade and while traveling for his trade, he obtained critical espionage information that was important to Washington for his troops. Ludington knew that Crosby had this vital information and his objective to get it in the correct hands. He aided Crosby in providing shelter and necessary provisions. Ludington helped other spies also, among them Benajah Tubbs. Ludington gathered information vital to Washington and passed it on to the Continental Army. He worked with John Jay in a spy ring that gathered information about British activities.\n\nLudington was much involved in the community of Patterson, New York. He built the \"Ludington Mill\" and gave the lumber required for building the first local academy, an important school for the town. He was one of its trustees of the Presbyterian church and helped purchase in 1793 the land for its cemetery.\n\nLudington was sociable and often in his retirement would meet with John Jay and John Crane at Elijah Townsend's house to reminisce about their days as spies of the American Revolution. He died of cancer at the age of 78 on January 24, 1817. His remains were buried in the churchyard of the town's Presbyterian church. His Patterson grave is marked with a tombstone that has a short inscription:\n\n<poem>\nIn Memory of\n\"Henry Ludington\"\nJan. 24, 1817\nAged 78 years\n</poem>\n\nHistorian William J. Blake of Putnam County said the epitaph was so simple that it didn't do justice for the patriot that helped develop the American government. Ludington's wife, Abigail, died eight years later at the age of 80 on August 3, 1825, and is buried beside him.\nThe Will of Ludington is now on file in the surrogate's office of Putnam County. Ludington instructed the executors of his estate to sell off a part of his farm to pay for debts he owed. The remaining part of his farm was to go to his wife, daughter, son and granddaughter. The Will said that if any of them married, they would relinquish their portion of the estate and it would go to the benefit of those still unmarried. The grist mill that Ludington built around 1775 and the immediate area was known as the hamlet of Ludingtonville. The grist mill contained the local post office. The mill was part of Ludington's Will. This area is now in the town of Kent which is near Carmel, New York.\n\nLudington was the grandfather of Harrison Ludington, who was the mayor of Milwaukee in 1871, 1873, and 1875 – also the 12th governor of Wisconsin. His daughter, Sybil Ludington, is known as the female Paul Revere for her role in alerting her father's minute men troops to meet the advancing British army. Ludington's grandson James founded Ludington, Michigan. The Ludington legacy has been handed down to several other states in the founding of other towns from his descendants.\n\n\n\n"}

Rescued from a slave ship headed for Brazil, he was apprenticed to a French shopkeeper and taught himself to read and write. Ezzidio eventually rose to the position of mayor of Freetown and later became a member the colonial governor's Legislative Council.\n\nEzzidio, a Nupe from what is now Niger State, was kidnapped by slavers when he was young and brought to an area populated by the Yoruba. In 1827, he was sold to white slave traders, who put him on board a ship bound for Brazil. The ship was intercepted by the Royal Navy,\n\nEzzidio became the apprentice of a French shopkeeper named Beyaust; Beyaust named his apprentice \"Isadore\". The name was written down as \"Ezzido\", and eventually morphed into \"Ezzidio\". After the death of the Frenchman, Ezzidio was hired by an English firm. He managed a European-owned shop and then used the money he saved to start his own trading firm. He taught himself to read and write.\n\nIn 1841, Ezzidio purchased property for £100. He visited England the next year, making import deals with companies based there; by importing directly, he eliminated the need for middle men. Goods that were sent to his George Street property, at a total value of between £3000 and £4000 per year, included clothing such as suits and boots, foodstuffs such as ham, cookies, tea, and fortified wines (port and sherry).\n\nIn 1844, William Fergusson, Governor of Sierra Leone, appointed him to the position of alderman, and in 1845 Ezzidio became Mayor of Freetown.\n\nIn 1862, Governor Samuel Wensley Blackall split the Governor's Council into two parts, an Executive and a Legislative Council; the latter allowed representation from, among others, the colony's merchants. The Mercantile Association, in a vote consisting of twenty-four Africans, fourteen Europeans, and one Caribbean merchant, elected Ezzidio to represent them on this body. While on the council, he was noted for his fairness and unobtrusiveness.\n\nEzzidio described himself as an \"oracle\" of the people; some people, meanwhile, nicknamed him \"dancing bear\" due to his size and energy.\n\nEzzidio joined the Wesleyan Church in 1835. He became a lay preacher in 1842 and also ran a Sunday school. He is recorded to have made the largest donation of all contributors at an 1864 church celebration.\n\nIn 1864, at Ezzidio's request, a white superintendent was sent from England to supervise the Wesleyan mission. This superintendent, Benjamin Trebaskis, was a Nonconformist, strongly sectarian, and opposed to the interdenominational cooperation Ezzidio and others in the church had previously supported. Trebaskis feuded with Ezzidio over church policy until the latter's death in October 1872.\n\nIn 2007, in a campaign to Africanise British street names, the government of Freetown announced plans to rename Howe Street after Ezzidio.\n"}

{"id": "507285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=507285", "title": "Layoff", "text": "Layoff\n\nA layoff is the temporary suspension or permanent termination of employment of an employee or, more commonly, a group of employees (collective layoff) for business reasons, such as personnel management or downsizing an organization. Originally, \"layoff\" referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work, or employment but this has evolved to a permanent elimination of a position in both British and US English, requiring the addition of \"temporary\" to specify the original meaning of the word. A layoff is not to be confused with wrongful termination. \"Laid off workers\" or \"displaced workers\" are workers who have lost or left their jobs because their employer has closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or shift was abolished (Borbely, 2011). Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce. Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Indeed, recent research on downsizing in the U.S., UK, and Japan suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance. Usually a layoff occurs as a cost-cutting measure.\n\nEuphemisms are often used to \"soften the blow\" in the process of firing and being fired. The term \"layoff\" originally meant a temporary interruption in work (and usually pay). The term became a euphemism for permanent termination of employment and now usually means that, requiring the addition of \"temporary\" to refer to the original meaning. Many other euphemisms have been coined for \"(permanent) layoff\", including \"downsizing\", \"excess reduction\", \"rightsizing\", \"leveraging synergies\", \"delayering\", \"smartsizing\", \"redeployment\", \"workforce reduction\", \"workforce optimization\", \"simplification\", \"force shaping\", \"recussion\", and \"reduction in force\" (also called \"RIF\", especially in the government employment sector). \"Mass layoff\" is defined by the United States Department of Labor as 50 or more workers laid off from the same company around the same time. \"Attrition\" implies that positions will be eliminated as workers quit or retire. \"Early retirement\" means workers may quit now yet still remain eligible for their retirement benefits later. While \"redundancy\" is a specific legal term in UK labour law. When an employer is faced with work of a particular type ceasing or diminishing at a particular location, it may be perceived as obfuscation. Firings imply misconduct or failure while layoffs imply economic forces beyond the employer's and employees' control, especially in the face of a recession such as the one that began in the late 2000s.\n\nRIF - A generic reduction in force, of undetermined method. Often pronounced like the word \"riff\" rather than spelled out. Sometimes used as a verb, as in \"the employees were pretty heavily \"riffed\"\".\n\neRIF – Layoff notice by email.\n\nIRIF - Involuntary reduction in force - The employee(s) did not voluntarily choose to leave the company. This usually implies that the method of reduction involved either layoffs, firings, or both, but would not usually imply resignations or retirements. If the employee is fired rather than laid off, the term \"with cause\" may be appended to indicate that the separation was due to this employee's performance and/or behavior, rather than being financially motivated.\n\nVRIF - Voluntary reduction in force - The employee(s) did play a role in choosing to leave the company, most likely through resignation or retirement. In some instances, a company may exert pressure on an employee to make this choice, perhaps by implying that a layoff or termination would otherwise be imminent, or by offering an attractive severance or early retirement package. Conversely, the company is not obliged to accept an employees decision and may not accept every employee who volunteers for a VRIF.\n\nWFR - Work force reduction.\n\nFollowing the recession of 2007-2008, the public sector has seen significantly smaller job growth in employment versus the private sector and layoffs have been used to ensure sustainability. As the public sector declines the demand for services from the private sector decline as well. Layoffs in the public sector have put limitations on the growth rate of the private sector, inevitably burdening the entire flow of markets.\n\nThe risk of being laid off varies depending on the workplace and country a person is working in. Unemployment compensation in any country or workplace typically has two main factors. The first factor of unemployment compensation depends on the distribution of unemployment benefits in a workplace outlined in an employee handbook. The second factor is the risk of inequality being conditioned upon the political regime type in the country an employee is working in. For example, in Canada, Dorion (1995) states that white-collar workers who have been made redundant receive higher re-employment wages, than those in blue-collar occupations as their job is regarded as being of a higher status than blue collar workers, whereas in France, Margolis (1999, 2002) finds that workers who have been laid off have smaller unemployment periods and higher re-employment earnings in comparison with other unemployed people. The amount of compensation will usually depend on what level the employee holds in the company.\n\nPackages may also vary if the employee is laid off, or voluntarily quits in the face of a layoff (VRIF). The method of separation may have an effect on a former employee's ability to collect whatever form of unemployment compensation might be available in their jurisdiction. In many U.S. states, workers who are laid off can file an unemployment claim and receive compensation. Depending on local or state laws, workers who leave voluntarily are generally ineligible to collect unemployment benefits, as are those who are fired for gross misconduct. Also, lay-offs due to a firm's moving production overseas may entitle one to increased re-training benefits. Some companies in the United States utilize Supplemental Unemployment Benefits. Since they were first introduced by organized labor and the Department of Labor in the early 1950s, and first issued in a Revenue Ruling by the IRS in 1956, SUB-Pay Plans have enabled employers to supplement the receipt of state unemployment insurance benefits for employees that experience an involuntary layoff. By establishing severance payments as SUB-Pay benefits, the payments are not considered wages for FICA, FUTA, and SUI tax purposes, and employee FICA tax. To qualify for SUB-Pay benefits, the participant must be eligible for state unemployment insurance benefits and the separation benefit must be paid on a periodic basis. There have also been increasing concerns about the organizational effectiveness of the post-downsized ‘anorexic organization’. The benefits, which organizations claim to be seeking from downsizing, center on savings in labor costs, speedier decision making, better communication, reduced product development time, enhanced involvement of employees and greater responsiveness to customers (De Meuse et al. 1997, p. 168). However, some writers draw attention to the ‘obsessive’ pursuit of downsizing to the point of self-starvation marked by excessive cost cutting, organ failure and an extreme pathological fear of becoming inefficient. Hence ‘trimming’ and ‘tightening belts’ are the order of the day.\n\nTraditionally, layoffs directly affect the employee. However, the employee terminated is not alone in this. Layoffs affect the workplace environment and the economy as well as the employee. Layoffs have a widespread effect and the three main components of layoff effects are in the workplace, to the employee, and effects to the economy.\n\nEffects of layoffs in the workplace: Layoffs have remained the greatest way for a company to cut costs. Although from the employer's perspective a layoff is beneficial for the business, layoffs create an uncertainty in the workplace environment and lowers other employees' job security as well as creates an apprehension and fear of termination for the remaining employees, and subsequently lowers overall motivation in the workplace environment. According to \"Healing the Wounds: Overcoming the trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Organizations,\" in the post-layoff environment, there is a need for empathy, tangibility, self-knowledge, and relentlessly seeking customers among the surviving employees. The remaining employees may have feelings of survivors guilt. In order to diminish negative effects of layoffs, Wayne Cascio suggests alternative approaches to layoff and downsizing as \"Responsible restructuring\" approach. Optimism is critical for rebuilding the workplace environment because employees look to their leaders for stability and predictability. No matter the position in an organization, employees will look for job security.\n\nEffects of layoffs to the employee: Employees (or former employees in this case) can be affected in a couple of different ways. When an employee is laid off, his or her general trust in long-term work may decrease, reducing expectations upon rehire. After an employee withstands a layoff, the effects can trickle into future employment and attitudes. Layoffs in the workplace often leave the former employee less inclined to trust future employers which can lead to behavioral conflicts among co-workers and management. Despite new employers not being responsible for a prior circumstances, job performance may still be affected by prior layoffs. Many companies work to make layoffs as minimally burdensome to the employee. At times employers may layoff multiple people at once to soften the impact.\n\nEffects of layoffs in the American economy: Layoffs create lower job security overall, and an increased competitiveness for available and opening positions. Layoffs have generally two major effects on the economy and stockholders. The way layoffs affect the economy varies from the industry that is doing the layoffs and the size of the layoff. If an industry that employs a majority of a region (freight in the northeast for example) suffers and has to lay employees off, there will be mass unemployment in an economically rich area. This can have leave ripple effects nationwide. Unemployment is the biggest effect on the economy that can come from layoffs.\n\nIn francophone Belgium, the term Procédure Renault has become a synonym for the consultation process leading to mass redundancies, due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late 1990s. When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay, which is also known as severance pay. The only time that a redundancy payment doesn’t have to be paid is if an employee is casual, working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months. The redundancy compensation payment for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave. If an employer can’t afford the redundancy payment they are supposed to give their employee, once making them redundant, or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee. An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant. An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a redundancy payment reduction. A layoff is also known as a retrenchment in (South African English). In the UK, permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called redundancy. Certain countries (such as Belgium, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Germany), distinguish between leaving the company of one's own free will, in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits, but may receive a onetime payment and leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour force size, in which case the person is entitled to them. A RIF reduces the number of positions, rather than laying off specific people, and is usually accompanied by internal \"redeployment\".\n\n\n\n"}

Earlier models make video calls utilizing older analogue POTS telephone lines, while later models use newer, higher quality, ADSL, ISDN or cable broadband technologies. Some videophones also employ Internet calling (IP) capabilities which can dispense with the need for telephone service.\n\nVideo conferencing systems allow multiple participants by use of a \"Multipoint Control Unit\" (a centralized distribution and call management system) or via a similar non-centralized multipoint capability technology embedded in each unit. Some multiple party systems utilize Web-based \"bridging service\" providers, which can incur slight time delays.\n\nSome cameras have a 360-degree video image, so that all participants on one location can be recorded with one camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Brands, manufacturers and other services listed here are no longer in production or no longer exist, and are listed for historical or research purposes.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe name \"videophone\" is not as standardized as its earlier counterpart, the \"telephone\", resulting in a variety of names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country. Videophones are also known as videotelephones (or video telephones) and often by an early trademarked name \"Picturephone\", which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The compound name\" \"videophone\" \"slowly entered into general use after 1950, although\" \"video telephone\" \"likely entered the lexicon earlier after\" \"video\" \"was coined in 1935.\n\n\"Videophone calls\" (also: \"videocalls\" and \"video chat\"), differ from videoconferencing in that they expect to serve individuals, not groups. However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term \"videoconferencing\" is now frequently used instead of \"videocall\" for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a \"video link\".\n\n\"Webcams\" are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many software clients for both video calls and videoconferencing.\n\nA \"videoconference system\" is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A \"videoconference\" (also known as a \"videoteleconference\") allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a multipoint control unit (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications. A separate webpage article is devoted to videoconferencing.\n\nA \"telepresence system\" is a high-end videoconferencing system and service usually employed by enterprise-level corporate offices. Telepresence conference rooms use state-of-the art room designs, video cameras, displays, sound-systems and processors, coupled with high-to-very-high capacity bandwidth transmissions.\n\nTypical use of the various technologies described above include calling or conferencing on a one-on-one, one-to-many or many-to-many basis for personal, business, educational, deaf Video Relay Service and tele-medical, diagnostic and rehabilitative use or services. New services utilizing videocalling and videoconferencing, such as teachers and psychologists conducting online sessions, personal videocalls to inmates incarcerated in penitentiaries, and videoconferencing to resolve airline engineering issues at maintenance facilities, are being created or evolving on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2980004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2980004", "title": "Merchant capitalism", "text": "Merchant capitalism\n\nSome Economic historians use the term merchant capitalism to refer to the earliest phase in the development of capitalism as an economic and social system—though others argue that mercantilism, which has flourished widely in the world without the emergence of systems like modern capitalism, is not actually capitalist as such.\n\nMerchant capitalism is distinguished from more fully developed capitalism by its focus on simply moving goods from a market where they are cheap to a market where they are expensive (rather than influencing the mode of the production of those goods), the lack of industrialization, and of commercial finance. Merchant houses were backed by relatively small private financiers acting as intermediaries between simple commodity producers and by exchanging debt with each other. Thus, merchant capitalism \"preceded\" the capitalist mode of production as a form of capital accumulation. A process of primitive accumulation of capital, upon which commercial finance operations could be based and making application of mass wage labor and industrialization possible, was the necessary precondition for the transformation of merchant capitalism into industrial capitalism.\n\nEarly forms of merchant capitalism developed in the medieval Islamic world from the 9th century, and in medieval Europe from the 12th century. In Europe, merchant capitalism became a significant economic force in the 16th century. The mercantile era drew to a close around 1800, giving way to industrial capitalism. However, merchant capitalism remained entrenched in some parts of the West well into the 19th century, notably the Southern United States, where the plantation system constrained the development of industrial capitalism (limiting markets for consumer goods) whose political manifestations prevented Northern legislators from passing broad economic packages (e.g. monetary and banking reform, a transcontinental railroad, and incentives for settlement of the American west) to integrate the states' economies and spur the growth of industrial capitalism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1291782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1291782", "title": "Public service", "text": "Public service\n\nPublic service is a service which is provided by government to people living within its jurisdiction, either directly (through the public sector) or by financing provision of services. The term is associated with a social consensus (usually expressed through democratic elections) that certain services should be available to all, regardless of income, physical ability or mental acuity. Even where public services are neither publicly provided nor publicly financed, for social and political reasons they are usually subject to regulation going beyond that applying to most economic sectors. Public policy when made in the public's interest and motivations can provide public services. Public service is also a course that can be studied at a college or university. Examples of public services are the fire brigade, police, air force, and paramedics.\n\nPublic services may be associated with fundamental human rights (such as the right to water). The Volunteer Fire Dept. and Ambulance Corps. are institutions with the mission of servicing the community. A service is helping others with a specific need or want. Here, service ranges from a doctor curing an illness, to a repair person, to a food pantry.\n\nIn modern developed countries, the term \"public services\" (or \"services of general interest\") often includes:\n\nIn modern democracies, public service is often performed by employees known as civil servants who are hired by elected officials. Government agencies are not profit-oriented and their employees are motivated very differently. Studies of their work have found contrasting results including both higher levels of effort and fewer hours of work. A survey in the UK found that private sector hiring managers do not credit government experience as much as private sector experience. Public workers tend to make less in wages when adjusting for education, although that difference is reduced when benefits and hours are included. Public workers have other intangible benefits such as increased job security.\n\nA public service may sometimes have the characteristics of a public good (being non-rivalrous and non-excludable), but most are services which may (according to prevailing social norms) be under-provided by the market. In most cases public services are services, i.e. they do not involve manufacturing of goods. They may be provided by local or national monopolies, especially in sectors which are natural monopolies.\n\nThey may involve outputs that are hard to attribute to specific individual effort or hard to measure in terms of key characteristics such as quality. They often require high levels of training and education. They may attract people with a public service ethos who wish to give something to the wider public or community through their work.\n\nGoverning bodies have long provided core public services. The tradition of keeping citizens secure through organized military defence dates to at least four thousand years ago.\n\nMaintaining order through local delegated authority originated at least as early as the Warring States period (5th to 3rd centuries BCE) in ancient China with the institution of \"xian\" (prefectures) under the control of a centrally-appointed prefect. Historical evidence of state provision of dispute resolution through a legal/justice system goes back at least as far as ancient Egypt.\n\nA primary public service in ancient history involved ensuring the general favor of the gods through a theologically and ceremonially correct state religion.\n\nThe widespread provision of public utilities as public services in developed countries usually began in the late nineteenth century, often with the municipal development of gas and water services. Later, governments began to provide other services such as electricity and healthcare. In most developed countries local or national governments continue to provide such services, the biggest exceptions being the U.S. and the UK, where private provision is arguably proportionally more significant. Nonetheless, such privately provided public services are often strongly regulated, for example (in the US) by Public Utility Commissions.\n\nIn developing countries public services tend to be much less well developed. For example, water services might only be available to the wealthy middle class. For political reasons the service is often subsidized, which reduces the finance potentially available for expansion to poorer communities.\n\nNationalization took off following the World Wars of the first half of the twentieth century. Across Europe, because of the extreme demands on industries and the economy, central planning was required to make production maximally efficient. Many public services, especially electricity, gas and public transport are products of this era. Following the Second World War, many countries also began to implement universal health care and expanded education under the funding and guidance of the state.\n\nThere are several ways to privatize public services. A free-market corporation may be established and sold to private investors, relinquishing government control altogether. Thus it becomes a private (not public) service. Another option, used in the Nordic countries, is to establish a corporation, but keep ownership or voting power essentially in the hands of the government. For example, the Finnish state owned 49% of Kemira until 2007, the rest being owned by private investors. A 49% share did not make it a \"government enterprise\", but it meant that all other investors together would have to oppose the state's opinion in order to overturn the state's decisions in the shareholder's meeting. Regulated corporation can also acquire permits on the agreement that they fulfill certain public service duties. When a private corporation runs a natural monopoly, then the corporation is typically heavily regulated, to prevent abuse of monopoly power. Lastly, the government can buy the service on the free market. In many countries, medication is provided in this manner: the government reimburses part of the price of the medication. Also, bus traffic, electricity, healthcare and waste management are privatized in this way. One recent innovation, used in the UK increasingly as well as Australia and Canada is public-private partnerships. This involves giving a long lease to private consortia in return for partly funding infrastructure.\n\n\n"}

The case produced a number of significant judgments on British constitutional law, and was the first time that courts held that they had power to restrain the application of an Act of Parliament pending trial and ultimately to disapply that Act when it was found to be contrary to EU law.\n\nThe litigation was lengthy, and is typically divided into five main stages:\n\nThe EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which began in 1970, aimed at creating a common market for fisheries products by providing for free access to the waters of all member states and introducing structural funds to ensure modernisation of the sector. In 1976 it was agreed that, as from 1 January the following year, member states would extend their exclusive economic zone, which included the limit of their fishing zones, to a distance from their coastlines. In 1980 the EU concluded a fisheries agreement with Spain, which did not become a member of the EU until 1985, which gave the latter (which had the largest fishing fleet in Europe) limited rights to fish in the waters of the member states. In 1983 concerns over the effect that equality of access might have on fishing stocks led to the introduction of certain controls, notably the concept of \"total allowable catches\" which set maximum quotas of fish which could be caught by each member state, and the British Fishing Boats Act 1983 (BFBA). In 1985, with Spanish accession, everything changed and the BFBA no longer applied to the Spanish fishermen.\n\nFrom 1980, as seen earlier, Galician fishermen began to enter the UK fishing market by taking advantage of easy fishing vessel registration requirements contained in the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. Although the 1894 Act prohibited ownership of vessels by non-UK nationals, UK-domiciled companies were allowed registration as the owners. Amongst the early beneficiaries of the 1894 Act was Factortame Limited, a company whose directors were Joseph J L Couceiro, John A Couceiro and Ken L Couceiro, all British nationals with Spanish ancestry resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The company, together with 96 others whose directors and shareholders were mostly Spanish nationals, re-registered 53 vessels which had formerly flown the Spanish flag as British fishing vessels under the 1894 Act. They also acquired 42 existing British vessels with a view to using them in the fishing zone. Most of these vessels landed their catches in Spain, but as the fish were caught in UK waters, they counted against the UK fishing quota, a practice known as \"quota hopping\".\n\nIn order to put an end to this practice, the British Government enacted a series of measures which proved largely ineffective. In two cases the High Court of Justice of England and Wales asked preliminary questions to ECJ; based on which both cases were lost by HMG - see Agegate (C-3/87, ) and Jaderow (C-216/87, ). In 1988 the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 and the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Fishing Vessels) Regulations were introduced as a result, to replace the system of registration contained in the 1894 Act with a new system under which a vessel could only be registered if it had \"a genuine and substantial connection\" with the UK. For this to be the case, three conditions had to be fulfilled: (i) the vessel must be British-owned; (ii) the vessel had to be managed and its operations had to be directed and controlled from the UK; and (iii) any charterer, manager or operator had to be a qualified person or company. A \"qualified person or company\" was a person who was a British citizen resident and domiciled in the UK or a company which was incorporated in the UK and had its principal place of business there having at least 75% of its shares owned by, and at least 75% of its directors being, \"qualified persons\".\n\nAs from 31 March 1989, fishing vessel registrations under the 1894 Act would lapse and the owners would be required to re-register under the 1988 Act. None of Factortame's vessels could satisfy the new requirements and an action for judicial review was brought by its owners in the Divisional Court of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in December 1988.\n\nFactortame Ltd sought, first, a preliminary injunction declaring that the offending part of the 1988 Act could not be applied to them on the grounds that such application would be contrary to directly effective rights under EU law, specifically the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality (article 7 of the Treaty of Rome), the right of individuals and companies to establish themselves in business anywhere in the EU (articles 43–48), and the right to participate in the capital of companies situated in another Member State (article 294). The claimants also demanded an order of prohibition preventing the Secretary of State from treating its registrations under the 1894 Act as having ceased.\n\nHMG argued that the registration requirements were intended to ensure that fishing vessels flying the British flag had a genuine link with the UK. It maintained that international law entitled each State to determine the conditions under which a ship might fly its flag and that Community law had not removed that right. It was also contended that the 1988 Act was consistent with the Community policy on fisheries. In the event this assertion proved false.\n\nOn 10 March 1989 the Divisional Court (Neill LJ and Hodgson J) referred the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 of the Treaty of Rome (case C-221/89). It asked whether requirements as to nationality, domicile and control imposed by a Member State as conditions for the registration of fishing vessels were compatible with Community law (now: European Union law). At the same time, the Court granted an injunction against the application of the 1988 Act pending a ruling by the ECJ. Giving his judgment, Lord Justice Neill stated that although Community law is part of English law and prevails in the event of a conflict, it was open to argument whether a conflict existed in this case; a national court would have to take a decision which preserves the \"status quo ante\". HMG disapproved and elevated the case to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe Court of Appeal (Lord Donaldson MR, Bingham LJ and Mann LJ) reversed the Divisional Court's decision on 22 March 1989 on the basis that, although a national court was obliged to give effect to Community law, it was not obliged \"to override national law in favour of what is no more than an alleged or putative Community right\". Furthermore, it did not believe that the Divisional Court had \"acknowledged the constitutional enormity, as the law stands, of requiring a Secretary of State to act contrary to the clearly expressed will of Parliament when the unlawfulness of that expression has yet to be established\". The Divisional Court would not, according to the court, have jurisdiction to grant an injunction until Factortame had succeeded before the ECJ.\n\nThe case was brought on 18 May 1989 by Factortame before the House of Lords (Lord Bridge, Lord Brandon, Lord Oliver, Lord Goff and Lord Jauncey) who upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that English law did not contain any rule allowing a preliminary injunction against the application of an Act of Parliament. According to Lord Bridge, two obstacles stood in the way of the granting of the injunction. Firstly, the relief sought required the court to order positive action in the shape of the disapplication of the 1988 Act and the application of the 1894 Act; were Factortame not to succeed before the ECJ, the House of Lords would have \"conferred upon them rights directly contrary to Parliament's sovereign will\". Secondly, the court had no jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction against the Crown.\n\nNevertheless, Lord Bridge did accept that each of these obstacles was subject to any contrary Community law requirement. This required the House of Lords to determine whether, regardless of the position in national law, there existed an overriding principle of Community law imposing an obligation on a national court, faced with a seriously arguable claim to rights having direct effect under Community law, to grant interim relief. Lord Bridge concluded that as there was no clear authority on this question, a decision from the ECJ was necessary to enable the House of Lords to give judgment. The House was, in any event, obliged to request a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC (now Article 267 TFEU post-Lisbon Treaty) which obliges courts \"against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law\" to make a reference. This request for a preliminary ruling was in addition to that already made by the Divisional Court on the compatibility of the 1988 Act with Community law.\n\nThe action was lodged at the ECJ on 10 July 1989 (as Case C-213/89) by the House of Lords with the request that it deal with the matter quickly, which it indeed did, giving the case priority over others. The whole matter had up until then proceeded with great speed, taking only 6 months from its commencement before the Divisional Court to the House of Lords' judgment. The questions posed essentially asked whether, in the circumstances of the case, Community law overrode English law and either empowered or obliged UK courts to grant the injunction claimed by Factortame.\n\nAdvocate-General Tesauro argued his opinion on 17 May 1990 (). He first noted that the injunction sought by Factortame would in fact be available in all Member States except the UK and Denmark. He then proceeded to conclude that a national court must have the power to provisionally set aside a national law which conflicts with Community law, founding his argument on three bases. He recalled that it had been established in Simmenthal (case 106/77) that directly effective Community law provisions create legal rights which are enforceable by individuals from the date of their entry into force, regardless of any contrary national law. It also followed from the ECJ's case law that it was for the legal system of each Member State to designate the procedures intended to protect Community law rights, and that these procedures must not \"be adapted so as it make it impossible in practice to exercise the rights which the national courts are required to protect\" (case 61/79, Denkavit, ). National courts must, in that respect, apply EC law through available national procedures or, failing that, of their own motion. Focusing on the House of Lords' argument that it could not temporarily suspend the application of a national law, the Advocate-General emphasised the importance of interim relief in every legal system, remarking that its purpose was to ensure that the time needed to establish a right would not deprive that right of any substance. Furthermore, he did not believe that national courts were entitled to give priority to national legislation merely because it had not yet been shown to be incompatible with Community law; if that were the case, rights conferred by national law would have greater protection than that offered to Community law rights.\n\nOn 19 June 1990 the ECJ court (as \"full court\" of 11 justices) \"en banc\" gave its ruling, rephrasing the question posed as \"whether a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule\". Following the Advocate-General's opinion, the ECJ held that a national court, in fact, has a duty to grant interim relief to safeguard alleged Community rights of individuals until the decision of the ECJ on the interpretation of Community law is available, and where a rule of national law would deny such relief, to set aside that rule. The basis of such a duty lies in the nature and object of directly effective Community law rights which are intended to be fully effective throughout the EU, and where, in order to safeguard such a right, it is necessary to grant interim measures, a national court must do so. This is especially true where a national court is awaiting a clarification or interpretation of the right claimed by the ECJ.\n\nOn 11 October 1990 the House of Lords gave its judgment in the light of the ECJ's ruling and granted an injunction in favour of Factortame. Three principal issues emerged from their judgment, namely the availability of interim relief against the Crown, the basis on which such relief can be granted, and the impact of the ruling on Parliamentary sovereignty. Lord Goff acknowledged that, as a matter of Community law, interim relief had to be available in principle against the Crown, and the basis for granting it lay in section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (now titled the Senior Courts Act 1981).\n\nIn deciding to grant relief to Factortame, two factors influenced the House of Lords. Firstly, the likelihood that Factortame would suffer hardship and loss, were relief not to be allowed. Secondly, the prospects of Factortame succeeding in a full trial of the case once the ECJ had given its ruling on the compatibility of the 1988 Act; in this regard, the House of Lords took into account indications from the ECJ's first ruling that Factortame's arguments had \"considerable force\". Lord Goff did, however, emphasise that the courts would not, in other cases, readily or easily grant an injunction against the Crown which effectively prevents the Crown from applying national law.\n\nAddressing the public criticism expressed following the ECJ's decision and the alleged erosion of Parliamentary sovereignty, Lord Bridge remarked that such comments were \"based on a misconception\", and that under the European Communities Act 1972, the law regulating the UK's membership of the EU, it had \"always been clear that it was the duty of a United Kingdom court when delivering final judgment, to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law\". In the same way that Parliament had introduced legislation to remedy areas of UK law which did not meet the standards set by EU directives, the House of Lords was now accomplishing the same task in giving judgment for Factortame. There was nothing new, in this respect, in recognising the supremacy of EU law in the areas in which it applies.\n\nThese comments were perceived by Sir William Wade as \"revolutionary\", in that Lord Bridge suggests that Parliament has, in passing the European Communities Act 1972, managed to bind its successors from repealing the Act impliedly. It had previously been thought that no parliament could ever bind its successors in such a way. In a case where two statutes conflicted, the traditional approach would have been to apply the later statute on the basis that the inconsistent parts of the earlier statute had been repealed.\n\nSuch an interpretation of the case is supported by statements in \"Thoburn v Sunderland City Council\" and \"Hunt v Hackney Borough Council\" to the effect that there now exist two forms of Acts of Parliament: ordinary acts which can be repealed impliedly, and \"statutory\" or \"constitutional\" acts which can only be repealed expressly. (See in particular the judgment of Laws LJ in \"Thoburn\".) Nevertheless, there is no restriction on the ability of Parliament to expressly repeal the European Communities Act 1972.\n\nFurthermore, the case does not, on a strict reading, constitute a breach of parliamentary sovereignty. The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was not a purposeful and direct conflict with EC law, but was instead an attempt to give effect to the fishing quotas required under EC law. Therefore, the courts were not striking down a domestic Act of Parliament, but were instead attempting to interpret legislation in a manner compatible with the Treaty obligations that arise under the European Communities Act 1972 (as proposed by Lord Diplock in the case of \"Garland v British Rail Engineering\"). It remains to be seen how the courts would respond to an Act of Parliament intentionally contradicting EC law. However, in the case of \"Macarthys v Smith\", Lord Denning suggested that, should such an event occur, the courts would be obliged to obey the domestic law over the European.\n\nOn 25 July 1991 the ECJ gave its ruling in case C-221/89 on the question referred by the High Court, namely whether the conditions for registration of fishing vessels under the 1988 Act were compatible with Community law. Agreeing with Advocate-General Mischo's opinion, the court (sitting as the full court of 11 justices) en banc held that \"it is for the Member States to determine ... the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for a vessel to be registered in their registers and granted the right to fly their flag, but, in exercising that power, the Member States must comply with the rules of Community law\". In particular, the conditions for registration should not constitute obstacles for nationals of one Member State to establish themselves in business in the territory of another Member State (the freedom of establishment), nor should they discriminate on the basis of nationality.\n\nIn the event, the ECJ found the nationality requirements in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 discriminatory and contrary to Article 43 EC as a restriction on the freedom of establishment. It also violated articles 12 and 221 EC. The residence and domicile conditions also breached Article 43. In effect, by introducing a requirement based on an individual's residence and domicile, the Act operated an unfair distinction between UK nationals and those from other Member States as \"the great majority of nationals of the [UK] are resident and domiciled in that State and therefore meet that requirement automatically, whereas nationals of other Member States would, in most cases, have to move their residence and domicile to [the UK] in order to comply with the requirements of [the 1988 Act]\". In respect of the condition that the vessel should be managed and its operations directed from the UK, the ECJ found, however, that this requirement was compatible with Community law.\n\nThe UK government had argued that the conditions imposed by the 1988 Act were justified on the basis that the Common Fisheries Policy allowed for a system of national quotas and the 1988 Act ensured the effectiveness of that system. This was rejected by the ECJ which stated that fishing vessel registration criteria were permitted, but not where they violated Community law. It was, in that respect, open to the UK government to introduce conditions ensuring that a \"real economic link\" existed between the ship and the State of registration, but such a link had to \"concern only the relations between the vessel's operations and the population dependent on fisheries and related industries\". In other words, it would have been possible for the UK government to prescribe conditions which protected UK fishing communities from the effects of the opening up of national fishing waters to other Member States, but it could not do that through the imposition of explicit nationality and residence conditions.\n\nFollowing the ECJ's second ruling, the case returned once more to the High Court which, on 18 November 1992, requested a third ruling from ECJ concerning the conditions under which a member state may incur liability for damage caused to individuals by breaches of Community law attributable to that state. At around the same time the German Federal Court had asked for a ruling on a similar question in the case of \"Brasserie du Pêcheur v Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" and so the two cases (C46/93 and C48/93) were joined.\n\nAt this time the ECJ had just delivered judgment in \"Francovich\" (), which established the principle that \"a State must be liable for loss and damage caused to individuals as a result of breaches of Community law\". The Factortame case provided the court for an opportunity to elaborate on the principles underlying the liability of member states. It was a case in which almost all member states intervened to deny, whether wholly or substantially, the right to claim damages; the UK accepted that there was, in principle, such a right. The EC Treaty does not deal expressly with the consequences of a breach of Community law by a member state, and so it was for the court to rule on the question having regard to \"the fundamental principles of the Community legal system and, where necessary, general principles common to the legal systems of the Member States\".\n\nIn its judgment delivered on 5 March 1996, the court of nine justices \"en banc\" reaffirmed the right of reparation, and stated that it existed irrespective of whether the provision of Community law in question has direct effect. Furthermore, the principle applies to any case where a member state breaches Community law, irrespective of which organ of the state was responsible for the breach. The ECJ rejected the contentions that the right to reparation required the introduction of legislation by the EU, and that the availability of damages should be decided, in each case, on the basis of the national law of the state in question.\n\nThe court proceeded to outline the conditions on which liability would be established. It underlined that such conditions could not, in the absence of a particular justification, differ from the conditions applicable to the liability of the Community in similar circumstances. Further, the right to reparation would depend on the nature of the breach of Community law in question and the extent of the discretion available to the State in question. The conditions are:\n\n\nIn the case where a state had exercised broad discretion in passing legislation which breached Community law (as was the case in Factortame), for the breach to be \"sufficiently serious\" it must be \"manifest\" and \"grave\". National courts have jurisdiction to decide how to characterise the breach in question, taking into account the clarity and precision of the Community rule infringed, whether the damage was intentional or involuntary, whether any error of law was excusable, and whether a Community institution contributed towards the adoption or maintenance of contrary national measures or practices. These same conditions apply to state liability for damage caused by the decision of a judicial body adjudicating at last instance.\n\nThe matter came back to the Divisional Court (Hobhouse LJ, Collins J and Moses LJ) which ruled on 31 July 1997 that HMG had committed a sufficiently serious breach of Community law in passing the offending provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, and that that breach gave rise to damage for which Factortame should be compensated. The court rejected a claim by Factortame for exemplary damages. The decision was appealed by HMG to the Court of Appeal (Lord Woolf MR, Schiemann LJ and Walker LJ) which rejected the appeal on 8 April 1998. HMG appealed again to the House of Lords (Lord Slynn, Lord Nicholls, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Clyde and Lord Hope).\n\nThe House of Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Factortame on 28 October 1999. It rejected the argument that HMG's reliance on legal advice at the time of passing the 1988 Act did not deprive the breach of its grave and manifest character. The court did accept, however, that the government had acted in good faith in passing the Act. Nevertheless, the government had been aware of the risk it was running with such legislation and it had done everything possible to ensure that fishermen could not obtain interim relief against the Act's application. The case would now go back to the Divisional Court for the amount of damages to be determined.\n\nIn March 2000, Factortame and the other claimants (approximately 90 Anglo-Spanish fishing companies) accepted an offer of settlement from the Secretary of State. Under the terms of the settlement the claimants, who had originally claimed £285 million, received £55 million including interest of some £26 million.\n\nOn 27 November 2000, Judge Toulmin in the Technology and Construction Court (a division of the High Court) held, under the Limitation Act 1980, Factortame's claims against the UK government were \"actions founded on tort\", and that consequently a six-year limitation period applied. This meant that other claims against the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 would only be admissible if they had been lodged by 10 July 1996 (i.e. six years from the House of Lords' decision of 9 July 1990 granting Factortame interim relief), otherwise such claims were statute-barred. The judge therefore rejected claims by Factortame in respect of other fishing vessels which had been refused registration under the 1988 Act, but which had not formed part of the original claim lodged in 1988, nor had been claimed before July 1996.\n\nThe judge also rejected an attempt by Factortame to obtain damages for injury to feelings and aggravated damages caused by HMG's breach of Community law. Factortame had argued that claims for discrimination under European law were broadly comparable to claims for discrimination to individuals under the Race Relations Act 1976. This was not accepted by Judge Toulmin who emphasised that such damages were only awarded in cases where the breach in question had caused harm to the claimant's self-esteem.\n\nThe \"Factortame\" case has produced large amounts of academic debate as to whether it can be reconciled with the idea of legislative supremacy as stated by Dicey. Sir William Wade argues that the Factortame judgment alters the Rule of Recognition.\n\nThe issue of whether the UK Parliament or the European Court of Justice has ultimate sovereignty over European Community laws which apply to the UK is still an area of intense legal debate and conflicting views. In current practice, the UK recognises the primacy of the European Court of Justice for those areas of law in which the EU has competency. However, in \"Macarthys Ltd v Smith\", Lord Denning MR said, \"If the time should come when our Parliament deliberately passes an Act—with the intention of repudiating the Treaty or any provision in it—or intentionally of acting inconsistently with it—and says so in express terms—then ... it would be the duty of our courts to follow the statute of our Parliament.\"\n\nThis view of the UK's ultimate sovereignty was supported by Lord Justice Laws in the \"Thoburn v Sunderland City Council\" case, when he said that \"there is nothing in the European Communities Act which allows the European Court, or any other institution of the EU, to touch or qualify the conditions of Parliament's legislative supremacy in the United Kingdom ... That being so, the legislative and judicial institutions of the EU cannot intrude upon those conditions.\"\n\nThat European law has primacy over UK law has been stated many times in European courts. In ECJ Case 6/64 \"Costa v ENEL\" (1964), the ECJ stated that \"the Members States have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields\". In Case 26/62 \"Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen\" (1963) their ruling states that \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights\".\n\nThe question of who has the ultimate \"kompetenz-kompetenz\" (i.e. the right to decide the limits the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction) has not been settled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many organizations that followed SAS 70 have now shifted to SSAE 16. Some service organizations are becoming savvy to the ability to use the SSAE 16 report status to show they are more capable, also encouraging their prospective end-users to make having an SSAE 16 standard part of new vendor selection criteria. It is widely known that public companies in the United States fall under the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act, also known as Sarbanes–Oxley or SOX. However, there are also a number of provisions of the Act (e.g. the willful destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation) that apply to privately held companies.\n\nSSAE 16 is largely an American standard, but it mirrors the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402. Similarly, SSAE 16 has two different kinds of reports. A SOC 1 Type 1 report is an independent snapshot of the organization's control landscape on a given day. A SOC 1 Type 2 report adds a historical element, showing how controls were managed over time. The SSAE 16 standard requires a minimum of six months of operation of the controls for a SOC 1 Type 2 report.\n\nSSAE 16 reporting can help service organizations comply with Sarbanes–Oxley's requirement (section 404) to show effective internal controls covering financial reporting. It can also be applied to data centers or any other service that might be used in the delivery of financial reporting.\n\nFor reports that are not specifically focused on internal controls over financial reporting, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has issued an Interpretation under AT Section 101 permitting service auditors to issue reports. These reports will now be considered SOC 2 audits and focus on controls at a service organization relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, or privacy.\n\nSSAE 16 provides guidance on an auditing method, rather than mandating a specific control set.

He started as a programmer, became an analyst and after 3 years he was a project manager specialized in the hospital sector. While working for SBAI Salvatore was also a professional football player for the Royal Charleroi Sporting Club.\n\nIn 1988, after quitting his career as a professional football player for the Royal Charleroi Sporting Club, Salvatore Curaba became Sales representative for the IT company Proget (which will be bought by IBS in 1996).\n\nIn 1994, Salvatore Curaba had to choose between a career as football coach or keep evolving in the IT sector. He opted for IT and was promoted Sales Manager for IBS. In 1998, after 10 years in this company and a few months before being nominated General Manager for IBS’s Brussels offices, Salvatore left the company to found his own IT company, EASI.\n\nAt the age of 35, Salvatore founded EASI on March 26, 1999 with Christian Castelain. EASI is a Belgian computer services company which offers solutions developed from the latest technology in sectors such as software and mobile applications, infrastructure and cloud computing. In 2012, the company counted 90 employees. This was an important tipping point. After more than 10 years of valuable collaboration between Salvatore Curaba and Christian Castelain, they decided that one person needed to take over the company. Salvatore decided to buy out his partner and became EASI’s unique CEO. From this moment, Salvatore managed his company the way he always wanted to: he developed a unique management style based on freedom, share and transparency. His main objective is his company’s performances combined to his employee’s happiness. Salvatore Curaba has made the choice to regularly sell his company shares to his collaborators. Elected \"Best Workplace\" of Belgium in 2015 and 2016 and 8th “Best Workplace” in Europe, EASI devotes much attention to the happiness of its 150 employees. Salvatore Curaba has been nominated for the Manager of the Year award by Trends Tendances in 2014 and EASI was nominated for the Enterprise of the Year award 2015 by Ernst & Young.\n\nIn 2015, after more than 30 years away from the football sector, Salvatore Curaba was approached to take over the Royal Albert Elisabeth Club from Mons. The deal was never concluded.\n\nLater in 2015, the Union Royale la Louviere Centre also contacted him to take over the club. These negotiations didn’t lead to a deal yet.\n\nSince 2014, Salvatore Curaba regularly gives speeches and conferences all around Belgium to share his story, his management philosophy, EASI’s keys to success and the happiness benefits.

He joined politics in 1994, founded the Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT) in 1998 and, after a landslide electoral victory, became prime minister in 2001.\n\nThaksin's government launched programs to reduce poverty, expand infrastructure, promote small and medium-sized enterprises, and universal healthcare coverage. Thaksin declared a \"war on drugs\" in which more than 2,500 people died and took a strong-arm approach against the separatist insurgency in the Muslim southern provinces. He was the first democratically elected prime minister of Thailand to serve a full term and was re-elected in 2005 by an overwhelming majority.\n\nAfter selling shares of his corporation worth more than a billion dollars to foreign investors without paying taxes, considerable criticism resulted. A citizens' movement against Thaksin, called People's Alliance for Democracy or \"yellow shirts\", launched mass protests, accusing him of corruption, abuse of power and autocratic tendencies. Thaksin called snap elections that were boycotted by the opposition and invalidated by the Constitutional Court.\n\nHe was overthrown in a military coup on 19 September 2006. His party was outlawed and he was barred from political activity. Thaksin has since lived in self-imposed exile except for a brief visit to Thailand in 2008. He was sentenced \"in absentia\" to two years in jail for abuse of power. From abroad he has continued to influence Thai politics, through the People's Power Party that ruled in 2008, and its successor organisation Pheu Thai Party, as well as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship or \"red shirt\" movement. His younger sister Yingluck Shinawatra was the prime minister of Thailand from 2011 to 2014.\n\nIn 2009, Thaksin said in an interview that he was living in Dubai and still had access to about $100 million of his money.\n\nThaksin's great-grandfather, Seng Saekhu, was an immigrant from Meizhou, Guangdong, China, who arrived in Siam in the 1860s and settled in Chiang Mai in 1908. His eldest son, Chiang Saekhu, was born in Chanthaburi in 1890 and married a Thai woman named Saeng Samana. Chiang's eldest son, Sak, adopted the Thai surname Shinawatra (\"routinely appropriate action\") in 1938 because of the country's anti-Chinese movement, and the rest of the family also adopted it.\n\nSeng Saekhu had made his fortune through tax farming. Chiang Saekhu/Shinawatra later founded Shinawatra Silks and then moved into finance, construction, and property development. Thaksin's father, Loet, was born in Chiang Mai in 1919 and married Yindi Ramingwong. Yindi's father, Charoen Ramingwong (born: Wang Chuan Cheng), was a Hakka immigrant who married Princess Chanthip na Chiangmai, a minor member of the Lanna (Chiang Mai) royalty. In 1968, Loet Shinawatra entered politics and became an MP for Chiang Mai and deputy leader of the now-defunct Liberal Party. Loet Shinawatra quit politics in 1976. He opened a coffee shop, grew oranges and flowers in Chiang Mai's San Kamphaeng district, and opened two cinemas, a gas station, and a car and motorcycle dealership. By the time Thaksin was born, the Shinawatra family was one of the richest and most influential families in Chiang Mai.\n\nThaksin was born in San Kamphaeng, Chiang Mai province. He is Theravada Buddhism. He lived in the village of San Kamphaeng until he was 15, then moved to Chiang Mai city to study at Montfort College. At 16, he helped run one of his father's cinemas.\n\nThaksin married Potjaman Damapong in July 1976. They have one son, Panthongtae and two daughters, Pintongtha and Peathongtarn. They divorced in 2008. Thaksin's youngest sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is said to have entered politics in 2011 at her brother's request as leader of the pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai Party and was elected prime minister on 3 July 2011. Thaksin earned a doctorate in criminology at Sam Houston State University. Thaksin Shinawatra is a former university lecturer at Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities of Mahidol University in 1979.\n\nThaksin Shinawatra was a member of the 10th class of the Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School, and was then admitted to the Thai Police Cadet Academy. Graduating in 1973, he joined the Royal Thai Police. He received a master's degree in Criminal Justice from Eastern Kentucky University in the United States in 1975, and three years later was awarded a doctorate in criminal justice at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. Returning to Thailand, he reached the position of Deputy Superintendent of the Policy and Planning Sub-division, General Staff Division, Metropolitan Police Bureau, before resigning his commission in 1987 as a Police Lieutenant Colonel and leaving the police. His former wife, Potjaman Damapong, is the daughter of a Police General Priewpan Damapong and now uses her mother's maiden name. He is a former university lecturer at Royal Police Cadet Academy in 1975-1976.\nThaksin Shinawatra was revoked his Police Lieutenant Colonel rank on September 2015.\n\nThaksin and his wife began several businesses while he was still in the police, including a silk shop, a cinema, and an apartment building. All were failures and left him over 50 million baht in debt. In 1982, he established ICSI. Using his police contacts, he leased computers to government agencies with modest success. However, later ventures in security systems (SOS) and public bus radio services (Bus Sound) all failed. In April 1986, he founded Advanced Info Service (AIS), which started off as a computer rental business.\n\nIn 1987 Thaksin resigned from the police. He then marketed a romance drama called \"Baan Sai Thong\", which became a popular success in theatres. In 1988, he joined Pacific Telesis to operate and market the PacLink pager service, a modest success, though Thaksin later sold his shares to establish his own paging company.\nIn 1989, he launched IBC, a cable television company. At that time, Thaksin had a very good relationship with Chalerm Yoobumrung, the minister of the Prime Minister's Office, who was in charge of Thai press and media. It is a question whether Chalerm granted the right to Thaksin to establish IBC to benefit his close friend, seeing that the project had been denied by the previous administration. However, it turned out to be a money loser and he eventually merged the company with the CP Group's UTV.\nIn 1989, Thaksin established a data networking service, Shinawatra DataCom, today known as Advanced Data Network and owned by AIS and the TOT. Many of Thaksin's businesses were later consolidated as Shin Corp.\n\nAdvance Info Service was given a monopoly contract by his contacts in the military in 1986 and operates under GSM 900 frequency. AIS grew rapidly and became the largest mobile phone operator in Thailand.\n\nThe Shinawatra Computer and Communications Group was founded in 1987 and listed in 1990.\n\nIn 1990, Thaksin founded Shinawatra Satellite, which has developed and operated four Thaicom communications satellites.\n\nIn 1999, the Shinawatra family spent some 1 billion baht establishing Shinawatra University in Pathum Thani. It offers international programs in engineering, architecture, and business management, though it ranks quite low in international standings.\n\nIn 2000, Thaksin acquired the ailing iTV television station from the Crown Property Bureau, Nation Multimedia Group, and Siam Commercial Bank.\n\nThaksin entered politics in late 1994 through Chamlong Srimuang, who had just reclaimed the position of Palang Dharma Party (PDP) leader from Boonchu Rojanastien. In a subsequent purge of Boonchu-affiliated PDP Cabinet ministers, Thaksin was appointed Foreign Minister in December 1994, replacing Prasong Soonsiri. Thaksin left Palang Dharma along with many of its MPs in 1996, and founded the populist Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party in 1998. After a historic election victory in 2001, he became prime minister, the country's first to serve a full term.\nThaksin introduced a range of policies to alleviate rural poverty; highly popular, they helped reduce poverty by half in four years. He launched the country's first universal healthcare program, the 30-baht scheme, as well as a highly notorious drug suppression campaign. Thaksin embarked on a massive program of infrastructure investment, including roads, public transit, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Nevertheless, public sector debt fell from 57% of GDP in January 2001 to 41% in September 2006. Levels of corruption were perceived to have fallen, with Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index improving from 3.2 to 3.8 between 2001 and 2005. The Thai Rak Thai party won an unprecedented landslide in the 2005 general election, which had the highest voter turnout in Thai history. Twelve years later, after Thaksin was removed from power, Chamlong Srimuang expressed regret at getting \"such a corrupt person\" into politics. The PDP soon withdrew from the government over the Sor Por Kor 4-01 land reform corruption scandal, causing the government of Chuan Leekpai to collapse.\n\nChamlong, strongly criticised for mishandling internal PDP politics in the last days of the Chuan-government, retired from politics and hand-picked Thaksin as new PDP leader. Thaksin ran for election for the first time for the constitutional tribunal and lost.\n\nThaksin joined the government of Banharn Silpa-Archa and was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Bangkok traffic. In May 1996, he and four other PDP ministers quit the Banharn Cabinet (while retaining their MP seats), prompting a Cabinet reshuffle. Many have claimed that Thaksin's move was designed to help give Chamlong Srimuang a boost in the June 1996 Bangkok Governor elections, which Chamlong returned from retirement to contest. But Chamlong lost to Bhichit Rattakul, an independent.\n\nChamlong's failure to buttress the PDP's failing power base in Bangkok amplified divisions in the PDP, particularly between Chamlong's \"temple\" faction and Thaksin's. Soon afterwards, Chamlong announced he was retiring again from politics.\n\nThaksin and the PDP pulled out of the Banharn-government in August 1996. In a subsequent no-confidence debate, the PDP gave evidence against the Banharn government, and in September 1996 Banharn dissolved Parliament.\n\nThaksin announced he would not run in the subsequent November 1996 elections but would remain as leader of the PDP. It suffered a fatal defeat in the elections, winning only one seat, and soon imploded, with most members resigning.\n\nOn 15 August 1997, Thaksin became Deputy Prime Minister in Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's government, after the Thai baht was floated and devalued on 2 July 1997, sparking the Asian Financial Crisis. He held the position for only three months, leaving on 14 November when Chavalit resigned.\n\nDuring a censure debate on 27 September 1997, Democrat Suthep Thaugsuban accused Thaksin of profiting from insider information about the government's decision to float the baht, but the next Democrat party-led government did not investigate the accusations.\n\nDuring this period, Thaksin also served on the Asia Advisory Board of the Washington, D.C. based Carlyle Group until he resigned upon becoming Prime Minister in 2001.\n\nThaksin founded the Thai Rak Thai (\"Thais Love Thais\" – TRT) party in 1998 along with Somkid Jatusripitak, PDP ally Sudarat Keyuraphan, Purachai Piumsomboon, and 19 others.\n\nWith a populist platform often attributed to Somkid, TRT promised universal access to healthcare, a 3-year debt moratorium for farmers, and 1 million THB locally managed development funds for all Thai villages.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai dissolved parliament in November 2000, TRT won a sweeping victory in the January 2001 elections, the first held under the Constitution of 1997. At the time, some academics called it the most open, corruption-free election in Thai history. Thai Rak Thai won 248 parliamentary seats (more than any other party previously) and needed only 3 more seats to form a government. Nonetheless, Thaksin opted for a broad coalition to gain total control and avoid a vote of no confidence, with the Chart Thai Party (41 seats) and the New Aspiration Party (36 seats), while absorbing the smaller Seritham Party (14 seats).\n\nThe Thaksin government faced allegations of corruption, authoritarianism, treason, conflicts of interest, acting non-diplomatically, and muzzling of the press. Thaksin was accused of tax evasion, lèse majesté (insulting King Bhumibol), and selling assets of Thai companies to international investors. Independent bodies, including Amnesty International, criticised Thaksin's human rights record. Thaksin was also charged for concealing his wealth during his premiership.\n\nProtests by the People's Alliance for Democracy occurred in 2006, and on 19 September 2006 a military junta which later called itself the Council for National Security (CNS) replaced Thaksin's care-taker government in a coup while he was abroad. The Constitutional Tribunal dissolved the Thai Rak Thai party for electoral fraud ex post facto, banning him and TRT's executives from politics for five years. The CNS-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin and his family's assets in Thailand, totalling 76 billion baht ($2.2 billion), claiming he had become unusually wealthy while in office. Thaksin and his wife had declared assets totalling 15.1 billion baht when he took office in 2001, although he had transferred many of his assets to his children and associates before taking office.\n\nThaksin returned to Thailand on 28 February 2008, after the People's Power Party, which he supported, won the post-coup elections. But after visiting Beijing for the 2008 Summer Olympics, he did not return to hear the final supreme court sentence and applied for asylum in the United Kingdom. This was refused, after which he had to move about from one country to another. In October, the Thailand Supreme Court found him guilty of a conflict of interest and sentenced him \"in absentia\" to two years imprisonment.\n\nThe People's Power Party was later dissolved by the Supreme Court, but party members regrouped to form the Pheu Thai Party, which Thaksin also supported. Thaksin is a supporter, and alleged bankroller, of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (aka \"Red Shirts\"). The Government revoked Thaksin's passport for his role in the UDD's protests during Songkran 2009. On 26 February 2010, the Supreme Court seized 46 billion baht of his frozen assets, after finding him guilty of abnormal wealth. In 2009 it was announced that Thaksin had obtained Montenegrin citizenship through that country's economic citizenship program.\n\nThaksin Shinawatra was the first prime minister of Thailand to complete a full term in office, and his rule is generally agreed to have been one of the most distinctive in the country's modern history. He initiated many eye-catching policies that distinguished him from his predecessors. They affected the economy, public health, education, energy, social order, drug suppression and international relations. He gained one re-election victory.\n\nThaksin's most effective policies were reducing rural poverty and the introduction of universal healthcare, allowing him to galvanise the vast and largely untapped support base of the rural poor, especially in the populous northeast.\n\nHis Cabinet consisted of a broad coalition of academics, former student leaders, and former leaders of the Palang Dharma Party, including Prommin Lertsuridej, Chaturon Chaisang, Prapat Panyachatraksa, Surapong Suebwonglee, Somkid Jatusripitak, Surakiart Sathirathai, and Sudarat Keyuraphan. Traditional regional power brokers also flocked to his government.\n\nHowever, his government was increasingly accused of dictatorship, demagogy, corruption, conflicts of interest, human rights offences, acting undiplomatically, using legal loopholes and displaying hostility towards a free press. A highly controversial leader, he has also been the target of numerous allegations of lèse majesté, treason, usurping religious and royal authority, selling assets to international investors, and religious desecration.\n\nThaksin's government designed its policies to appeal to the rural majority, initiating programs like village-managed microcredit development funds, low-interest agricultural loans, direct injections of cash into village development funds (the SML scheme), infrastructure development, and the One Tambon One Product (OTOP) rural small and medium enterprise development program.\n\nThaksin's economic policies helped Thailand recover from the 1997 Asian financial crisis and substantially reduce poverty. GDP grew from 4.9 trillion baht in 2001 to 7.1 trillion baht in 2006. Thailand repaid its debts to the International Monetary Fund two years ahead of schedule.\n\nIncome in the northeast, the poorest part of the country, rose by 46% from 2001 to 2006. Nationwide poverty fell from 21.3% to 11.3%. Thailand's Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, fell from .525 in 2000 to .499 in 2004 (it had risen from 1996 to 2000) ). The Stock Exchange of Thailand outperformed other markets in the region. After facing fiscal deficits in 2001 and 2002, Thaksin balanced the national budget, producing comfortable fiscal surpluses for 2003 to 2005. Despite a massive program of infrastructure investments, a balanced budget was projected for 2007. Public sector debt fell from 57 per cent of GDP in January 2001 to 41 per cent in September 2006. Foreign exchange reserves doubled from US$30 billion in 2001 to US$64 billion in 2006.\n\nCritics say Thaksinomics is little more than a Keynesian-style economic stimulus policy re-branded. Others claimed that the policies got the rural poor \"hooked on Thaksin's hand-outs.\"\n\nThaksin helped legalise Thailand's massive underground lottery system numbers game (Thai: หวย) to be run by the Government Lottery Office. Lottery sales of approximately 70 billion baht (US$2 billion) were used for social projects, including the \"One District, One Scholarship\" program. The Thaksin government also privatised MCOT, a large television and radio broadcaster.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, many of Thaksin's economic policies were ended, the OTOP program was rebranded, the Government Lottery Office's program was deemed illegal, and the government nationalised several media outlets and energy companies. However, economists from Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) published a report indicating that many of the populist policies had not boosted the economy and some were by coincidence.\n\nThaksin initiated two key healthcare policies: subsidised universal health care and low-cost universal access to anti-retroviral HIV medication (ARVs). Thaksin's 30-baht/visit universal healthcare program won the applause of the general public, but was criticised by many doctors and officials. Prior to the program's introduction, a large portion of the population had no health insurance and only limited access to healthcare. The program helped increase access to healthcare from 76% of the population to 96%. The program also increased workloads for health care employees, and caused many doctors to change to higher paying careers. It has also been criticised for being underfunded by the government. The program caused some hospitals to seek alternative sources of income, leading to a boom in medical tourism, with 1.3 million foreign patients earning Thailand THB33 billion (US$800 million) in 2005.\n\nPost-coup public health minister Mongkol Na Songkhla called the 30 baht program a \"marketing gimmick\" and claimed that the government would \"very soon\" stop charging patients any fees for visits to state hospitals. Many people who received the treatment claimed that they prefer drugs from pharmacists than from facilities covered by the scheme and almost half of the patients were dissatisfied with the service given by the facilities. The universal health care scheme raised a debt of 7.7 billion baht.\n\nDuring the Thaksin government, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS as well as the overall prevalence rate noticeably declined. Although successful in expanding access to HIV medication, there have been concerns that a free trade agreement with the US could endanger Thailand's ability to produce generic HIV treatments. Thaksin allowed the estimated 2.3 million migrant workers in Thailand to register and seek health coverage under the Thai national healthcare system. They were also eligible for work permits at the end of the registration period, entitling them to full labour protection. Democrat Party Labour Group Committee Pongsak Plengsaeng criticised the move, claiming that it would lead to unemployment amongst Thais.\n\nThaksin initiated several highly controversial policies to counter a perceived boom in the Thai drug market, particularly in methamphetamine. Earlier policies like border blocking (most methamphetamine is produced in Myanmar), education, sports, and promoting peer pressure had proved ineffective. In a 4 December 2002 speech on the eve of his birthday, King Bhumibol noted the rise in drug use and called for a \"War on Drugs.\" Privy Councillor Phichit Kunlawanit called on the government to use its majority in parliament to establish a special court to deal with drug dealers, stating that \"if we execute 60,000 the land will rise and our descendants will escape bad karma\".\n\nOn 14 January 2003, Thaksin launched a campaign to rid \"every square inch of the country\" of drugs in three months. It consisted of changing the punishment policy for drug addicts, setting provincial arrest and seizure targets including \"blacklists\", awarding government officials for achieving targets and threatening punishment for those who failed to make the quota, targeting dealers, and \"ruthless\" implementation. In the first three months, Human Rights Watch reports that 2,275 people were killed, almost double the number normally killed in drug-related violence. The government claimed that only around 50 of the deaths were at the hands of the police, the rest being drug traffickers who were being silenced by their dealers and their dealers' dealers. Human rights critics claimed a large number were extrajudicially executed. The government went out of its way to publicise the campaign, through daily announcements of arrest, seizure, and death statistics.\n\nAccording to the Narcotics Control Board, the policy was effective in reducing drug consumption, especially in schools, by increasing the market price.\n\nKing Bhumibol, in a 2003 birthday speech, praised Thaksin and criticised those who counted only dead drug dealers while ignoring deaths caused by drugs.\n\nBhumibol also asked the commander of the police to investigate the killings. Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again claimed that few of the deaths were at the hands of the police.\n\nThe war on drugs was widely criticised by the international community. Thaksin requested that the UN Commission on Human Rights send a special envoy to evaluate the situation, but said in an interview, \"The United Nations is not my father. I am not worried about any UN visit to Thailand on this issue.\"\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, the military junta appointed a committee to investigate the anti-drug campaign. Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee's results \"The Economist\" reported in January 2008: \"Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet this week he said there was insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It is easy to see why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the PPP won last month's elections, those names were omitted.\"\n\nWhile he was opposition leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva accused Thaksin of crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the campaign. After being appointed Prime Minister, Abhisit opened an investigation into the killings, claiming that a successful probe could lead to prosecution by the International Criminal Court. Former attorney-general Kampee Kaewcharoen led the investigation and the investigation committee was approved by Abhisit's Cabinet. Abhisit denied that the probe was politically motivated. Witnesses and victims were urged to report to the Department of Special Investigation, which operated directly under Abhisit's control. As of the August 2011 parliamentary elections, Abhisit's investigation failed to find or publicise any conclusive evidence linking Thaksin or members of his Government to any extrajudicial killings.\n\nOne of Thaksin's educational reforms was school decentralisation, as mandated by the 1997 Constitution. It was to delegate school management from the over-centralized and bureaucratised Ministry of Education to Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAOs), but met with massive widespread opposition from Thailand's 700,000 teachers, who would be deprived of their status as civil servants. Teachers also feared that TAOs lacked the ability to manage schools. In the face of massive teacher protests and several threats of school closure, Thaksin compromised and gave teachers whose schools were transferred to TAO management two years to transfer to other schools.\n\nOther intended policy changes included learning reform and related curricular decentralisation, mostly through greater use of holistic education and less use of rote learning.\n\nTo increase access to universities by lower income people, Thaksin initiated the Student Loan Fund (SLF) and Income Contingency Loan (ICL) programs. He initiated the ICL program to increase access to higher education, whereby needy students could secure a loan to support their studies from vocational to university levels. Thai banks had traditionally not given educational loans. The ICL, however, required recipients to start repayments when their salaries reached 16,000 baht a month, with interest equivalent to inflation from the day the loan was granted. The SLF had an eligibility limit on family income, but interest was 1 per cent starting a year after graduation. The programs were merged and the income limit modified after Thaksin's government was overthrown.\n\nThaksin was one of the first supporters of Nicholas Negroponte's One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, with the Thai Ministry of Education committing to purchase 600,000 units. The junta later cancelled the project.\n\nThaksin also initiated the controversial \"One District, One Dream School\" project, aimed at developing the quality of schools to ensure that every district had at least one high-quality school. It was criticised, with claims that the only beneficiaries were Thaksin and companies selling computers and educational equipment. Many schools fell deeply into debt in implementing the project, receiving inadequate financial support from the central government.\n\nIn addition, he altered the state university entrance system, which had relied exclusively on nationally standardised exams. Thaksin pushed for greater weighting of senior high-school grades in the hope of focusing students on classroom learning rather than private entrance exam tutoring.\n\nIn energy policy, the Thaksin government continued the Chuan Leekpai government's privatisation agenda, but with important changes. Whereas the Chuan government's post-Asian financial crisis policies sought economic efficiency through industry fragmentation and wholesale power pool competition, Thaksin's policies aimed to create national champions that could reliably support stronger economic growth and become important players in regional energy markets. Thaksin also initiated a policy to encourage renewable energy and energy conservation. Many Thaksin-era energy policies were reversed following the 2006 coup.\n\nA resurgence in violence began in 2001 in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand with their Muslim, ethnic Malay majority. There is much controversy about the causes of this escalation. Attacks after 2001 concentrated on police, the military, and schools, but civilians (including Buddhist monks) are also regular targets. Thaksin was widely criticised for his management of the situation.\n\nOf three key controversial incidents, the first was the Army's storming of the Krue Se Mosque, where protesters had holed up and were killed.\n\nThe second, in October 2004, was the killing of 84 Muslim demonstrators at Tak Bai, when the Army broke up a peaceful protest. Hundreds of detainees were forced at gunpoint to lie shackled and prone in Army trucks, stacked like cordwood. The trucks were delayed from moving to the detainment area for hours. The 84 victims were reported to have been asphyxiated, crushed or died of overheating. The precise nature and cause of death have been subject to controversy and doubt because of lack of transparency and absence of depth in investigations made. There are other reports of many more deaths but these have not been substantiated.\n\nIn a third incident, Muslim lawyer Somchai Neelapaijit disappeared, allegedly abducted and killed by police for his role in defending alleged insurgents who claimed to have been tortured. Despite witness testimony and forensic evidence during the court of police investigations and court trials, all allegations against police said to be involved were dropped and the enforced disappearance case closed.\n\nThaksin announced an escalation of military and police activity in the region. In July 2005, Thaksin enacted an Emergency Decree to manage the three troubled provinces. Several human rights organisations expressed their concerns that the decree might be used to violate civil liberties.\n\nIn March 2005, Thaksin established the National Reconciliation Commission, chaired by former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun to oversee efforts to bring peace to the troubled South. In its final report in June 2006, the commission proposed introducing elements of Islamic law and making Pattani-Malay (Yawi) an official language in the region along with Thai. The Thaksin administration assigned a government committee to study the report, but nothing came of it.\n\nThaksin blamed Malaysia's jungle that has occasionally been used to train Islamic militants to cause violence in the south and Indonesia for being an inspiration to the militants.\n\nOne of the most visible of Thaksin's administrative reforms was the restructuring of government department and ministries, labelled the \"big bang.\" It was hailed as a \"historic breakthrough\" and \"the first major reorganization of ministries since King Chulalongkorn set up Thailand's modern system of departmental government in 1897.\" Plans had been studied for years to loosen perceived rigidities and inertia of the old system but were not implemented until the Thaksin government.\n\nThe restructuring was designed to streamline the bureaucracy and focus it on performance and results. New ministries were carved out in Social and Human Security Development, Tourism and Sports, Natural Resources and Environment, Information and Communication Technology, and Culture.\n\nThaksin transformed the role of provincial governors to that of active policy managers. Historically, central government ministries operated in the provinces through field offices headed by senior officials who reported back to Bangkok, while the Interior Ministry appointed provincial governors whose role was largely ceremonial.\n\nA key component of Thaksin's administrative reform policy, the \"CEO-governors\" epitomised what was called his \"transformation of the operating style of the traditional bureaucracy into a more results-oriented instrument that would be responsive.\" Piloted in 2001 and introduced in all provinces in October 2003, CEO-governors were put in charge of planning and co-ordinating provincial development and became accountable for overall provincial affairs. The \"CEO governors\" were assisted by \"provincial CFOs\" from the Ministry of Finance who reported directly to each governor. Governors were authorised to raise funds by issuing bonds and were given an intensive training course. After the coup, the junta reverted the role of governors.\n\nThe Thaksin era also saw the opening of a number of government one-stop service centres to reduce red tape for anything from investment to utilities and ID-card processing.\n\nThaksin initiated negotiations for several free trade agreements with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US. The latter especially was criticised, with claims that high-cost Thai industries could be wiped out.\n\nThailand joined the US-led invasion of Iraq, sending a 423-strong humanitarian contingent. It withdrew its troops on 10 September 2004. Two Thai soldiers died in Iraq in an insurgent attack.\n\nThaksin announced that Thailand would forsake foreign aid, and work with donor countries to assist in the development of neighbours in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.\n\nThaksin was repeatedly attacked for acting undiplomatically with foreign leaders and the international community. Besides his famous swipe at the UN (see The 'war on drugs' above), there were also allegations of gaffes at international meetings.\n\nThaksin was keen to position Thailand as a regional leader, initiating various development projects in poorer neighbouring countries like Laos. More controversially, he established close, friendly ties with the Burmese dictatorship, including extending the impoverished country a 4 billion baht credit line so it could conclude a satellite telecom deal with his family business.\n\nThaksin energetically supported his former foreign minister Surakiart Sathirathai's somewhat improbable campaign to become UN Secretary General.\n\nDespite debate and long abandonment of the plan due to the stability of the ground for the location of the airport, the Thaksin government pushed to complete the construction of the new Suvarnabhumi International Airport. The airport was officially opened a week after Thaksin's government was overthrown. It is one of the world's largest airports.\n\nHowever, some members of Thaksin's government were accused of corruption in the Suvarnabhumi Airport project. These allegations were used by the military junta to justify the 2006 coup. The junta initiated several investigations into the airport. Nevertheless, investigative panels found that damage to the airport was \"minute\" and \"common.\" The cost of repairing the damage was estimated at less than 1% of the total airport cost. The junta was accused by its opponents of delaying airport repairs and intensifying the airport's problems to pin further blame on the Thaksin government. \n\nThaksin was accused of \"policy corruption\", such as infrastructure and liberalisation policies that, while legal and a potential benefit to society, also aided companies that were owned by his family members. Supannee Chai-amporn and Sirinthip Arun-rue of the National Institute of Development Administration claimed that policy corruption caused the state to spend nearly 30 per cent more than it otherwise should have spent, costing the state an additional 400 billion baht. Other examples cited were the Board of Investment's granting tax breaks worth a total of THB16.4 billion to Shin Satellite for its iPSTAR project in 2003, and the Transport Ministry's decision the same year to abolish the minimum air fare of THB3.8 /km when Shin Corp was about to enter into a joint venture with low-cost carrier AirAsia to open a Thai subsidiary.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, the military junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin's assets based on charges of policy corruption.\n\nThaksin denied the allegations. \"They just made up a beautiful term to use against me. There's no such thing in this government. Our policies only serve the interests of the majority of the people\", he said. From 2002 to 2006, the stock price of Shin Corp increased from 38 to 104 baht (an increase of 173 per cent) while the stock price of Shin Satellite fell. In the same period, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 161 per cent, and the price of other major SET blue chip companies increased vastly more. Industry deregulation caused the market share of AIS to fall from 68 per cent to 53 per cent.\n\nTransparency International reported that Thailand's reputation for transparency among business executives improved somewhat during the years of the Thaksin government. In 2001, Thailand's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) was 3.2 (ranked 61), whilst in 2005, the CPI was 3.8 (ranked 59).\nHowever, a study of Worldwide Governance Indicators by the World Bank gave Thailand a lower score on Control of Corruption during 2002–2005 under Thaksin when compared to the Democrat-led government of 1998–2000.\nIn 2008 Thaksin Shinawatra was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in absentia over a corrupt land deal. In a ruling that made him the first Thai politician to be convicted of corruption committed while prime minister, Thaksin was found to have violated conflict of interest rules in helping his wife buy land from a state agency at a reduced price.\n\nImmediately after the events in March 2010, Abhisit Vejjajivas stated that he would talk to the red shirt leadership, but not to Thaksin. He criticised Thaksin's wealth and extravagance, carving a contrast between the alleged opulence of the premier's house and the humbler, agrarian roots of many of the demonstrators. Shortly after, he also directly condemned his opponent's self-proclaimed affinity with the ordinary people, the \"phrai\", arguing that Thaksin was far closer to the \"ammart\", or the traditional elites in Thailand's army, bureaucracy, and political parties.\n\nThaksin's government was accused of exerting political influence in its crackdown on unlicensed community radio stations, and Thaksin brought massive defamation suits against critical journalists.\n\nThaksin was also accused of interference when the Senate appointed Wisut Montriwat (former Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance) to the position of Auditor General, replacing Jaruvan Maintaka.\n\nThaksin has been engaged in a series of lawsuits brought by American businessman William L. Monson regarding Thaksin's takeover of a cable-television joint venture the two partnered in during the 1980s.\n\nUnder the slogans \"Four Years of RepairFour years of Reconstruction\" and \"Building Opportunities\", Thaksin and the TRT won landslide victories in February 2005 elections, sweeping 374 out of 500 seats in Parliament. The election had the highest voter turnout in Thai history. But his second term was soon beset by protests, with claims that he presided over a \"parliamentary dictatorship.\"\n\nThe political crisis was catalysed by several accusations published by media mogul and popular talk show host Sondhi Limthongkul, a former Thaksin supporter who had broken with him. These included accusations that Thaksin:\n\nOn 23 January 2006, the Shinawatra family sold their entire stake in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings. The Shinawatra and Damapong families netted about 73 billion baht (about US$1.88 billion) tax-free from the sale, using a regulation that made individuals who sell shares on the stock exchange exempt from capital gains tax. Thaksin was the target of accusations of corruption for selling forbidden national assets such as national utility company to a foreign entity in exchange for personal profits and kickbacks. Thai laws at the time disallowed the sale of integral assets of national importance to the public or to any foreign entity, but Thaksin amended the laws to allow such sale.\n\nThaksin faced pressure to resign following the Shin Corp. sale.\n\nProtests, led by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) whose leaders included Chamlong and Sondhi, soon swelled to tens of thousands who occupied the area around Government House in Bangkok. They consisted of both working-class and middle-class Bangkokians and included prominent social figures, academics and students.\n\nThaksin announced a House dissolution on 24 February 2006. General elections were scheduled for 2 April.\n\nThaksin was attacked for calling the snap elections, which in effect prevented any member of parliament from changing parties. In an editorial, \"The Nation\" noted it \"fails to take into consideration a major fallacy of the concept [of democracy], particularly in a less-developed democracy like ours, in which the impoverished, poorly informed masses are easily manipulated by people of his ilk. And Thaksin's manipulation has been well documented.\"\n\nThaksin's TRT Party won the widely boycotted elections, gaining 462 seats in Parliament, with the ratio of voters to no-voters 16:10, not counting non-voters.\n\nHowever, by-elections were needed for 40 TRT candidates who failed to win the minimum 20% required by the 1997 Constitution in an uncontested seat. The Democrat Party refused to contest them and, along with the PAD, petitioned the Central Administrative Court to cancel them. Chamlong Srimuang declared that the PAD would ignore the elections and \"go on rallying until Thaksin resigns and Thailand gets a royally appointed prime minister\".\n\nThey were held on 25 April and resulted in the TRT winning 25 of the constituencies and losing 2. Yet another round of by-elections on 29 April was scheduled for 13 constituencies. The Thai Rak Thai Party was later accused and found guilty of paying smaller parties to contest the election to fulfill the 20% rule, while the Democrat Party was accused of paying smaller parties not to. The by-elections were suspended by the Constitution Court while it deliberated whether to annul the main elections. In press interviews in exile, Thaksin was to insist on his technical majority.\n\nOn 8 May 2006, the Constitutional Court ruled 8–6 to invalidate the April elections based on the awkward positioning of voting booths. The ruling was called a landmark case in \"judicial activism.\" The Democrat Party, which had boycotted the April elections, said they were now ready to contest an October election.\n\nA new election was ordered and later set for 15 October. The Court found the Election Commissioners guilty of malfeasance and jailed them. But the election was cancelled when the military seized power on 19 September.\n\nThaksin announced on 4 April 2006 that he would not accept the post of Prime Minister after Parliament reconvened, but would continue as Caretaker Prime Minister until then.\n\nHe then delegated his functions to Caretaker Deputy Prime Minister Chidchai Wannasathit, moved out of Government House, and went on vacation.\n\nIn the evening of 19 September 2006, while Thaksin was visiting New York City to attend a UN summit and speak at the Council on Foreign Relations, the army took control of Bangkok. At Government House, some 50 soldiers ordered approximately 220 policemen in the complex to lay down their weapons. Troops also surrounded the Thaicom satellite receiving station and state-run television station Channel 11. By the morning of 20 September, tanks and military vehicles armed with machine guns were stationed at Government House, the Royal Plaza and government units along Rajdamnoen Avenue.\n\nTroops participating in the coup were from the 1st and 3rd Army Regions, the Internal Security Operations Command, the Special Warfare Centre and Army units in Nakhon Ratchasima and Prachin Buri provinces and sections of the Navy. According to coup leader Army Commander General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, the coup leaders had arrested Deputy Prime Minister Chitchai Wannasathit and Defense Minister Thammarak Isaragura na Ayuthaya.\n\nThe military, originally calling itself the Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional Monarch (CDRM), issued a statement citing the government's alleged \"lèse majesté\", corruption, interference with state agencies, and creation of social divisions as reasons for the coup. It declared the king of Thailand the head of state, and said elections would be held soon to return democracy to the country. Thaksin later arrived in Britain, where he had family.\n\nMany Thai Rak Thai party members were reported to have resigned from the party in the aftermath of the coup for fear that the party would be dissolved by the junta and its members banned from politics. These included Somsak Thepsuthin and 100 members of the Wang Nam Yen faction. It was not clear whether Suriya Jungrungreangkit, another influential member of the faction, would also resign. Sontaya Kunplome was reported to have led 20 members of the Chonburi faction in resigning from the party.\n\nOn 2 October 2006 Thaksin and his former deputy Somkid Jatusipitak resigned from the TRT. Chaturon Chaisang took over as party head.\n\nThe TRT was finally dissolved on 30 May 2007 by the Constitutional Tribunal, which banned over 100 of its executives, including Thaksin, from politics for five years, based on charges that two party executives (Defense Minister Thammarak and Pongsak Raktapongpaisarn) bribed a smaller party to stand in the April 2006 election. The Democrat party was cleared on a similar charge.\n\nOn 31 December 2006 and 1 January 2007, several bombs exploded in Bangkok, killing and wounding a number of bystanders. General Surayud accused \"those who lost power as a result of the military takeover\" of masterminding the bombings, but did not directly identify Thaksin. Thaksin went on CNN to publicly deny any involvement in the bombings. The government did not make any arrests in the case.\n\nThaksin's diplomatic passport was revoked on 31 December 2006 after the junta accused him of engaging in political activities while in exile. Thai embassies were ordered not to facilitate his travels.\n\nA junta-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin's assets and attempted to bring charges against him. The AEC was criticised for being stacked with anti-Thaksin appointees. At one point, AEC Secretary Kaewsan Atibodhi claimed that \"evidence and witnesses are useless\", when an AEC panel recommended legal action without hearing 300 witnesses or considering 100 additional pieces of evidence. The AEC froze Thaksin's assets\n\nIn January 2007, Financial Institutions Development Fund complied with an Assets Examination Committee request to file a charge against Thaksin and his wife over their purchase of four 772 million baht plots of land from the FIDF in 2003. The charge was based on alleged violation of Article 100 of the National Counter Corruption Act, which prohibits government officials and their spouses from entering into or having interests in contracts made with state agencies under their authority.\n\nThe Assets Examination Committee also accused Thaksin of issuing an unlawful cabinet resolution approving the spending of state funds to buy rubber saplings.\n\nIn March 2007, the Office of the Attorney-General charged Thaksin's wife and brother-in-law with conspiring to evade taxes of 546 million baht (US$15.6 million) in a 1997 transfer of Shin Corp shares.\n\nThe Assets Examination Committee found Thaksin guilty of malfeasance for obstructing competition by imposing an excise tax on telecom operators. Thaksin's Cabinet had approved the relevant executive decree in 2003.\n\nAs prime minister, Thaksin had unsuccessfully sought to buy the English Premier League football clubs Fulham and later Liverpool, in what critics claimed was a publicity stunt in response to his political problems.\n\nOn 21 June 2007, now out of office, he bought Premier League club Manchester City for £81.6 million. He became briefly popular with fans (who nicknamed him 'Frank'), especially after appointing Sven-Göran Eriksson manager of the club and bringing in prominent players. Eriksson was later critical of Thaksin's running of the club, saying \"he [Thaksin] didn't understand football – he hadn't a clue.\" He sold the club to investors from Abu Dhabi United Group in September 2008 for a reported £200 million.\n\nAfter selling Manchester City Football Club, Thaksin was nominated as \"honorary president\" but does not have any administrative responsibilities. However, he was later dismissed from honorary club president after the club has decided to take a position against him following his conviction and is currently \"on the run\" from Thai authorities.\n\nIn May 2007, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said Thaksin was free to return to Thailand, and he would personally guarantee Thaksin's safety. In January 2008 Thaksin's wife Potjaman was arrested on arrival in Bangkok but released on bail after appearing at the Supreme Court, with orders not to leave the country. She was set to be tried for alleged violation of stock-trading and land sale laws.\n\nOn 28 February 2008, Thaksin arrived in Bangkok after 17 months in exile. Thaksin again stated he would not re-enter politics and wished to focus on his football interests. In March Thaksin pleaded not guilty before the Supreme Court in one of his two criminal corruption cases. He was ordered to report back on 11 April after the court granted a month-long trip to England.\n\nIn June the Supreme Court denied Thaksin's request to travel to China and Britain, since his corruption case was set for trial and was ordered to surrender his passport after arraignment. In July the Court assumed jurisdiction over the fourth corruption charge against Thaksin concerning the soft loans to Burma. The court also agreed to hear allegations that Thaksin, his former cabinet, and three members of the current government, broke anti-gambling laws by setting up the new state lottery in 2003.\n\nPotjaman was found guilty on 31 July and sentenced to three years imprisonment, but released on bail. The Bangkok Criminal Court also convicted her adopted brother Bhanapot Damapong and her secretary, who allegedly held assets for Thaksin by proxy, of tax evasion.\n\nOn 10 August 2008, Thaksin and Potjaman violated the bail term by attending the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Beijing. Stating that he wishes to return to Thailand but claimed it was not currently safe for him and his family. Thaksin wishes to seek political asylum in the United Kingdom, claiming his political enemies were interfering with the judiciary, however there is no evidence to suggest he proceeded with this request and his asylum case was neither approved nor declined.\n\nThe Thailand Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions issued a second arrest warrant on 16 September 2008 against Thaksin over another of the four pending corruption cases and ordered suspension of the trial. Several more arrest warrants were issued over subsequent no-shows at various corruption trials.\n\nOn 21 October 2008, the Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions ruled that Thaksin, while prime minister, abused his power to help his wife buy public land at auction, and sentenced him to two years in jail.\n\nSoon after, Thaksin told Reuters, \"I have been informed of the result. I had long anticipated that it would turn out this way\", and added that the case was politically motivated.\n\nChief prosecutor Seksan Bangsombun called on Britain to extradite him. Thaksin now denied he was seeking political asylum in Britain.\n\nOn 10 November 2008, a Philippine spokesman said his government would \"politely\" turn down any request for political refuge from Thaksin due to Manila's \"friendly\" relations with Bangkok.\n\nThe British Government Home Office, meanwhile, revoked Potjaman and Thaksin's visas due to their convictions, while the Bangkok British Embassy e-mailed airlines directing them to disallow either of them to board flights to Britain. In late 2008, \"Arabian Business\" reported after an exclusive interview that the UK froze $4.2 billion of his assets in the UK. However, the UK government has not confirmed or denied this claim.\n\nThaksin had reportedly considered sanctuaries such as China, the Bahamas, Nicaragua, and several other countries in South America and Africa. Reports said the Shinawatras were granted honorary citizenship by the Bahamas and Nicaragua, and were building a £5.5 million home in China. As of late May 2009, he reportedly remained in Dubai. A spokesman claimed Thaksin was travelling on six passports, none of them Thai. In December 2008 Thaksin obtained a residency permit for Germany which was subsequently withdrawn on 28 May 2009 when the German government became aware of the arrangement. Thaksin then obtained status as a diplomat of Nicaragua. Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, lifted the travel restriction banning Thaksin from entering Germany on 15 July 2011 after the election victory of Thaksin's proxy party.\n\nIn a November 2009 interview, Thaksin told \"The Times\" that he was living in Dubai, still had access to about $100 million of his money outside of Thailand, and was investing in gold mines, diamond polishing and lottery licenses in various countries.\n\nIn mid-April 2009, violent protests of mostly Thaksin-supporters calling themselves the National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) led to the cancellation of the ASEAN summit in Pattaya and declaration of a state of emergency in Bangkok. Thaksin had been giving enthusiastic encouragement at UDD rallies via satellite and phone-in link, at one point calling for a \"people's revolution\", following the suppression of the protests he claimed to have merely been offering \"moral support.\"\n\nThaksin supported protests by the UDD against the Abhisit Vejjajiva government, demanding Thaksin be allowed to return free from all the earlier corruption charges. Thaksin denied leading the UDD, claiming he only gave them \"moral support.\"\n\nIn April 2009, Privy Councilor General Pichitr Kullavanijaya reported he had been informed by former US ambassador to Thailand Ralph L. Boyce that Thaksin had laundered 100 billion baht (US$2.8 billion) through Cayman Island bank accounts to organise the anti-government protests.\n\nOn 4 November 2009, it was announced that Thaksin Shinawatra had been appointed a special advisor to the Cambodian government and Hun Sen and stated that Cambodia would refuse to extradite Thaksin because it considered him a victim of political persecution.\n\nOn 5 November 2009, both countries recalled their ambassadors.\n\nThai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva stated this was \"the first diplomatic retaliation measure\". Stating Cambodia was interfering in Thailand's internal affairs and as a result all bi-lateral co-operation agreements would be reviewed. Sok An, a member of the Council of Ministers and Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, said Thaksin's appointment is a decision internal to Cambodia and \"conforms to international practice\". The mutual withdrawal of ambassadors is the most severe diplomatic action to have occurred between the two countries.\n\nOn 11 November 2009, Sivarak Chutipong was arrested by Cambodian police for passing the confidential flight plans of Thaksin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to Kamrob Palawatwichai, First Secretary of the Royal Thai Embassy in Cambodia. Sivarak was a Thai engineer working in Cambodia for Cambodia Air Traffic Service, the private firm which manages air traffic control in Cambodia. Sivarak denied that he was a spy, and the Thai government claimed that he was innocent and that the incident was a Thaksin/Cambodian plot to further damage relations between the two countries. The Thai First Secretary was expelled from Cambodia. Sivarak demanded that former First Secretary Kamrob speak out and restore his damaged reputation by confirming he was not involved in a spy ring. Kamrob refused to provide comment to the press throughout the controversy, and Kasit's secretary, Chavanond Intarakomalyasut, insisted that although that there was no misconduct on the part of the First Secretary or Sivarak, there would be no statement from Kamrob. Sivarak's mother appeared often on Thai television, pleading for the government to assist her son.\n\nSivarak was later sentenced to jail for 7 years. Thaksin personally requested the Cambodian government to pardon Sivarak, and he was soon pardoned by King Norodom Sihamoni and expatriated. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban later accused Sivarak of staging his own arrest in order to discredit the Abhisit government. Former Thai spy chief and Foreign Minister Prasong Soonsiri concurred, claiming, \"It has been a set-up from the beginning.\n\nOn 26 February 2010, the Supreme Court was scheduled to render its verdict on whether to seize his family's Thai assets, worth 76 billion baht frozen by the AEC after the coup. The AEC froze the assets under the authority of Announcement No. 30 of the military junta. Tensions ran high through Thailand, tens of thousands of government security forces were deployed, particularly in routes leading to Bangkok. However, the UDD denied that it would rally on the date of the verdict. The nine Supreme Court judges had to make a judgment on accusations of abnormal wealth through policy corruption. Policy corruption, was defined by the court as the abuse of powers by implementing economic policies that, while in themselves legal and of potential benefit to society and the economy, also aided companies that were owned in part by the policy maker. The prosecution claimed that Thaksin abused his powers five times while Premier.\n\nThe court first ruled that Thaksin and Potjaman were the real owners of the assets, rather than his children and relatives. The court also ruled that it had the authority to seize assets, based on the announcements of the junta. The court found Thaksin guilty of four out of five policy corruption, and ordered that 46 billion baht be seized. The remaining 30 billion continued to remain frozen.\n\nThe judges decided to seize 46 billion differences in value of Shin Corp. shares from the date when he came to office and the value when the shares were sold to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in early 2006. Note that, Thaksin had declared around 500 million baht in assets and Pojaman had 8 billion to 9 billion baht while Thaksin served as prime minister. Nevertheless, during that period, Shin shares gained 121%, compared with a 128% gain in the benchmark SET index, while Siam Cement, one of Thailand's premier blue chip companies, gained 717%. The judges did not find that Thaksin was guilty of malfeasance. They also noted that any benefit to the government from Thaksin's policies was irrelevant to the ruling. The government reaped approximately 100 billion baht in increased revenue from changes in the concession agreements alone.\n\nIn an email to his supporters, Thaksin claimed that the court was used as a tool. He also noted how the Thai stock market rose to the benefit of many companies, not just his, and claimed that all charges against him were politically motivated. He thanked his supporters for not protesting while the verdict was being read, and implored them to use non-violent means in the future. Pojaman na Pombejra insisted that tens of billions of baht of her wealth had been given to her children and relatives well before Thaksin took office in 2001 and denied that her children and relatives were nominees of her and her husband. She also denied having any control over Ample Rich and Win Mark, two firms that the AEC had accused of being her nominees. In spite of Pojaman's claim, Thaksin was the authorised signature for Ample Rich through 2005, making him the only individual authorised to withdraw funds from the company's account until he transferred the authority to his children, four years after he took office in 2001.\nSome UDD members held a small protest in front of the court, but did not disrupt the ruling as the government had predicted they would. The UDD leaders announced that a large-scale protest was scheduled to be held on 14 March 2010.\n\nOn the evening of 27 February (Saturday of a 3-day holiday), M67 grenades were thrown from a motorcycle outside three branches of Bangkok Bank. Nobody was hurt or injured in the attacks. The perpetrators were not caught, and no organisation claimed responsibility for the attacks. Thaksin and the UDD were quick to deny any involvement. An arrest warrant was issued based on sketches of a motorcycle driver.\n\nThe laws does not allow the prime minister to run a side business while holding office. Thaksin was pressed charged on wealth concealment while in office.\nPrior to the wealth declaration of Thaksin and his family when he took office, there has been an appeal to The National Anti-Corruption Commission that there are some suspicions about the numbers in the report.\n\nThaksin was charged with illegally concealing billions of baht of his wealth by transferring ownership of Shin Corp. shares to his drivers and maids, without their knowledge. Thaksin tearfully told the Constitutional Court that it was an honest mistake before the Court acquitted him on the charges.\n\nThere was also a controversy over whether there was any hidden tax evasion when Thaksin and Potjaman transferred their Shin Corporation shares to their children. Panthongtae and Pinthongta Shinawatra were accused of being nominees of their parent.\n\nThe transfer of shares from Thaksin and Potjaman to Parnthongtae was claimed to have been a sham, since there was no actual transfer of money. Panthongtae said the shares were sold to him at cost. Thaksin stated he had a written agreement proving the transfer to his son. Prior to the transfer, Panthongtae had signed an agreement with his father to settle a 4.5 billion baht debt from buying 300 million shares of the Thai Military Bank (TMB). However, the actual market value of the TMB shares at that time was only 1.5 billion baht. This showed a \"fake debt\" of 3 billion baht had been created. The Assets Examination Committee (AEC) discovered that Panthongtae's account that receives Shin Corporation's dividend has been used to transfer money to Potjaman's account to the amount of 1.1 billion baht.\n\nPintongtha also was accused of being nominee for her parents. She said that the money from her mother was a \"birthday present\". This birthday present was used to buy 367 million shares of Shin Corporation, which leaves her brother with the same amount. The AEC found the account has been receiving dividends from Shin Corp. There were no transactions between Pintongtha's account and her mother's account. However, the dividend money was used to buy SC Asset shares from WinMark to the amount of 71 million baht and shares from 5 real-estate firms from 2 funds in 2004 worth of 485 million baht.\n\nDSI, AEC, and Securities and Exchange Commission discovered that both WinMark and the two funds are owned by Thaksin and his former wife.\n\nThaksin has received the following royal decorations in the Honours System of Thailand:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4415577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4415577", "title": "Tverskoy District", "text": "Tverskoy District\n\nTverskoy District () is a district of Central Administrative Okrug of the federal city of Moscow, Russia. Population: \n\nThe district extends from Kitai-gorod northwest to Belorussky and Savyolovsky Rail Terminals . Its southern boundary runs one or two city blocks south from Tverskaya Street; eastern boundary follows the track of the Neglinnaya River now flowing in a tunnel under Samotechnaya Street, Tsvetnoy Boulevard, and Neglinnaya Street.\n\nTverskoy District houses State Duma, Federation Council, the Mayor of Moscow, Moscow City Council, and Moscow Police Headquarters. It contains Theatre Square, the business district of Tverskaya Street with Pushkin Square, Petrovka Street, Dmitrovka Street, and the western part of Kuznetsky Most. It has the highest concentration of theatres, including Bolshoi Theatre and the historical Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions.\n\nHistorical areas of Patriarshy Ponds, Malaya Bronnaya Street, and most of Tverskoy Boulevard, while closely associated with Tverskaya Street actually belong to Presnensky District. Since 2002 Tverskoy District also includes Kitai-gorod, which was once a separate territory managed directly by Central Administrative Okrug.\n\n\"This section is based on P. V. Sytin's \"History of Moscow Streets\"\"\n\nTverskaya Street emerged, as the road to Tver, in the 12th century. Dmitrovka Street, the road to Dmitrov, and Petrovka Street, leading to Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, date back to the 14th century.\n\nUntil the 1820s, the territory of what is now Tverskoy District was separated from the Moscow Kremlin by the Neglinnaya River. Because of that, the city grew primarily eastward in the Middle Ages—into the Red Square and Kitai-Gorod—while the development of western territories lagged behind. A stone bridge connecting Tverskaya with the Red Square was built in 1595. Urban development in the western part concentrated along Tverskaya Street. In the late 15th century, it was built out with country-like wooden homes to Pushkin Square, and by the end of the 16th century the city extended beyond the present-day Garden Ring. First stone Boyar houses appeared in downtown Tverskaya around that time. In 1654, Strastnoy Monastery was set up in present-day Pushkin Square, and three years later, Odoyevsky family set up a stone mansion on the site of present-day Museum of Modern History (formerly Museum of Revolution), beyond the Bely Gorod walls. \n\nDmitrovka Street also developed rapidly after the fire of 1648, as marked by the one-of-a-kind eight-tented church of Nativity in Putinki. Unusually for Moscow outskirts, it was financed by the State, as the church was located near the Embassy Inn (), home to foreign guests.\n\nPeter the Great's move of the national capital to Saint Petersburg actually improved the leading role of Tverskaya Street, as it became the main road of royal journeys between two capitals. Tverskaya acquired Moscow's first triumphal arch (1703, giving name to Triumphalnaya Square), Gagarin family palace (1760s), and Zakhar Chernyshyov mansion (1782); later the seat of Moscow Governor, Mossovet, and currently of the Mayor of Moscow (which was rebuilt in the 1940s). The Fire of 1812 wiped out wealthy mansions and peasant homes alike, sparing only the Pushkin Square; Tverskaya was rebuilt as an upper-class street and retained this status ever since.\n\nNortheastern side of Tverskoy District (east of Petrovka Street) lagged behind Tverskaya Street and Moscow's east side due to frequent floods on the Neglinnaya River. First attempt to control the river, proposed in 1775 by Matvey Kazakov, materialized in 1792 Neglinnaya Canal, which was running parallel to the river. Once the canal was completed, the old river bed was filled with earth. In 1817–1819, the channel was covered with masonry vaults, locking the stream in an underground tunnel. This created Neglinnaya Street, the youngest street inside Boulevard Ring, but did not rule out future floods. The most recent flood, in 1973, led to complete rebuilding of the aging tunnel (1974–1989, see 1965 flood photos) Another legacy of the Neglinnaya river survives in Central Baths (1890) and Sandunovsky Baths (1896).\n\nThe first public theater, \"Petrovsky Teatr\", was set up in 1780 by English entrepreneur Michael Maddox and Prince Urusov in present-day Theatre Square. It burned down in October 1805 after 425 successful shows. In 1825, Joseph Bove built a new, larger Bolshoi Theatre on the same site. By this time, downtown stretch of the Neglinnaya River was contained in an underground tunnel; Peter's bastions of Kitai-gorod were razed, forming the Theatre Square. In the same 1825, landowner Vargin built Maly Theatre on his own adjacent lot. For the first five years, the State leased the building from Vargin; he was later convicted of fraud and the State bought out the building in 1832. Owners of the opposite land lots were obliged to build houses exactly like Maly Theatre, forming a perfectly symmetrical neoclassical square with a parade ground and water fountain. The symmetry was eventually ruined by expansions in the 1870s, which added the third theatre—originally Bronnikov private theater (now Molodyozhny Theater).\n\nAnother historical hall, the Assembly of Nobility (now the House of the Unions) stands on the corner of Bolshaya Dmitrovka and Okhotny Ryad streets since 1790. The building, designed by Matvey Kazakov, was rebuilt externally, but the Pillar Hall inside it, famous for its acoustics, remains close to Kazakov's original design. When the State lifted the ban on private theatres in 1882, tradition continued with Moscow Art Theatre in Kamergersky Lane (1902–1909), Yermolova Theatre (1925), Hermitage (1883), and Aquarium (1898) park theatres, etc. Currently, Tverskoy District has nineteen repertory theatres, the Pillar Hall, Tchaikovsky Hall (1940), and Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard (originally Salamonovsky Circus, 1880, rebuilt in 1987–1989).\n\nUnlike Presnensky or Basmanny Districts, Tverskoy has, and always had, very few industrial properties. However, its northern part, beyond Garden Ring, developed into a working-class neighborhood in line with the 19th-century industrialization. Development began in the 18th century with the Butyrka prison (rebuilt to a castle shape in 1800). For the next hundred years, the territories around the prison were filled with farms and small wooden homes. Things changed with the construction of railroads—Smolensk railroad station was built in 1870; current building, known as Belorussky Rail Terminal, was completed in 1909. Savyolovsky Rail Terminal and Moscow Ring Railroad followed in the 1900s. Territories near the railroads were quickly used for factories, cheap housing for workers followed soon.\n\nMiusskaya Square, located three blocks from Belorussky Terminal, was a site of unusual urban development, a new center of blue-collar social life. In the course of one decade, 1904–1914, the city and private sponsors built Abrikosova Hospital and Nursery (1906), Junior High School (1912), Shanyavsky University (1913), kindergartens, and trade schools. Development of similar social hubs in other working districts lagged behind and terminated with World War I and Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nRedevelopment of Tverskaya Street began in the late 1920s with infill buildings like Ivan Rerberg's Central Telegraph (1927), and Grigory Barkhin's Izvestia building in Pushkin Square (1927). This was followed by demolition of Okhotny Ryad and Manege Square.\n\nMajor reconstruction of Tverskaya Street began in 1937 with demolition of Strastnoy Monastery and dozens of smaller buildings. Three buildings, including Savvinskoye Podvorye, Mossovet building, and the Eye Clinic, were spared from demolition and moved to new foundations farther from the street. As a result, Savvinskoye Podvorye is now completely locked inside a 1930s stalinist block. Another building, a print shop at Pushkin Square, was moved in the 1970s to make way for Izvestia expansion.\n\nDesign of the first stretch of new Gorky Street (the name of Tverskaya since 1935) was awarded to Arkady Mordvinov, 1929 graduate in architecture known for his ultra-left public statements. Mordvinov proved himself a good project manager, successfully testing so-called \"flow method\" of fast-track construction. By 1941, most of central Gorky Street was completed; the rest was built out after World War II.\n\nIn the 1970s, the street acquired Brezhnev-era boxlike buildings of 23-story Intourist Hotel (1970, demolished in 2002) and smaller Minsk Hotel (1964, demolished in 2005) and New Izvestia building; less controversial pseudo-stalinist infill buildings followed in the 1980s and late 1990s. However, outside Tverskaya, historical buildings and neighborhoods were being demolished throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Many blocks in the Novoslobodskaya station area are already rebuilt as post-2000 highrises. The City has declared plans to reconstruct Pushkin Square and Belorussky Terminal Square with mult-level underground tunnels, shopping space, and parking, but those plans were later abolished with mayor resignation.\n\nPopulation of Tverskoy District is traditionally affluent and educated, with a substantial share of foreigners (most of them are not included in official population count). Its ethnic mix, changing rapidly since the 1980s, has high shares of Tatars, Armenians and Jews; once-strong Ukrainian community has dispersed. Like all Central Okrug population, Tverskoy residents have life expectancy of three to four years higher than other Muscovites, attributed to better education and social status.\n\nThe Ministry of Education and Science has its head office in the district. For their role in the Sergei Magnitsky case, several judges of the Tverskoy District Court are subject to the American Magnitsky Act sanctions, prohibiting their entrance to the United States and use of the US banking system.\n\nKorean Air operates its CIS office in the district.\n\n\n\n"}

His great-great-grandfather David-Vita moved to Split in 1774 from Maribor (Ger.: Marburg), Slovenia. He chose his surname \"Morpurgo\" from the Italian version of the German \"Marburger\" (i.e. someone from Marburg). From 1846 to 1849 Morpurgo attended and finished elementary school in Split. Later he attended the Royal grammar school in Split from which he graduated in 1856.\n\nAfter completing his education, Morpurgo was employed at the library which was co-owned by his father and his business partner Petar Savo. There Morpurgo developed bookseller activity enabling him partnership with numerous foreign publishing houses. In 1855 he traveled to Trieste, Italy to sign contracts with booksellers and publishers. In 1860 Morpurgo founded his own bookstore \"Libreria Morpurgo succ. Savo\" by buying out Savo's shares. In 1861 he started the first interlibrary loan in Split. In 1862 bookstore was renamed to \"Libreria Morpurgo\". In 1859 Morpurgo published the \"Annuario Dalmatico\" (\"Dalmatian Yearly\") and in 1861 he published the second volume which in contrast to the first volume discussed the political problems in the country. During 1861 out of ten political publications released in Split, five were published by Morpurgo. During that time he also published the variety of commemorative books and brochures.\n\nMorpurgo's bookstore, from the very beginning of its activity, was the headquarters of the People's Party, where young intellectuals, inspired by the ideas of the \"Hrvatski narodni preporod\" (\"Croatian national revival\"), held their meetings. Morpurgo was an informal organizer and adviser of the People's Party. Morpurgo was involved in starting the independent Croatian weekly newspaper \"Narodni list\" (\"People's paper\"). He took upon himself the administration and management of the newspaper, and also wrote the articles, mainly against the mayor Antonio Bajamonti Autonomist Party policies. Morpurgo was often targeted by the Autonomist Party supporters who repeatedly physically attacked him in the street (in July 1867, July 1868 and during the summer 1870). In 1870 Morpurgo was elected representative of the People's Party in the Diet of Dalmatia, assembly of the Kingdom of Dalmatia.\n\nIn 1875, Morpurgo founded the first steam brick factory in Split. At home and abroad he was known for his alcoholic beverages company \"Morpurgo\", largest distillery in Dalmatia. In 1905 Morpurgo merged with Emil Stock to found the alcoholic beverages company \"Morpurgo, Stock e Comp.\" New company got the franchise to build the new liquor factory near Split (today part of Split). Factory concession was challenged by the municipal prefect Vicko Mihaljević due to environmental issues. Some attributed this problem to the political conflict (Mihaljević was member of the Party of Rights) between Morpurgo and municipal authorities. Due to the disappointment of failing to get the concession, Morpurgo and Stock built the factory in Rovinj, Croatia.\n\nMorpurgo was also the elected vice president of the \"Split Trade Chamber\" and later its president. In 1870 Morpurgo co-founded the \"Prva pučka dalmatinska banka\" (\"First people's Dalmatian bank\") in order to help Dalmatian farmers regain material independence from the mostly autonomist (members of the Autonomist Party) landowners, small capitalists and usurers who were lending money to farmers and during elections forced them to vote for the Autonomist Party. The bank initially operated in the Morpurgo's bookstore, as he was the first vice-president and later a president.\n\nMorpurgo died on 31 January 1911 in Split. He was buried at the Marjan hill Jewish cemetery.\n\nToday many historians agree that Morpurgo's political ideas were aimed at the awakening of Croatian national consciousness, improving the economy of Dalmatia, education and cultural upliftment of its citizens. As a trader, bookseller, banker, publisher and columnist, Morpurgo dedicated his life to the People's Party goals.\n\n"}

Born 1861 March 17 or February 14 in Port Douglas, British Columbia (at the north end of Harrison Lake, at the start of the Douglas Road to Lillooet, British Columbia during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush), Won Cumyow was the oldest son of Won Ling Sing, a Hakka-speaking store and restaurant owner who had emigrated in 1858 from China to San Francisco and later to Port Douglas. Won Cumyow was the first person of Chinese descent known to have been born within the boundaries of present-day Canada (British Columbia being a colony in 1861). He attended high school in New Westminster and became a court interpreter (1888) and labour contractor. He was an interpreter in the Vancouver police court from 1904 to 1936, speaking English, Cantonese, Hakka, and also the Chinook Jargon which he had learned as a child at Port Douglas. He studied law, even articled, but was not permitted a license because, being Chinese, he was denied the vote.\n\nCumyow voted for the first time in 1890 but provincial legislation in 1895-1896 stripped Chinese (and Japanese and First Nations) voting rights in elections in BC (though his name still does appear on the 1898 BC voters list). The voters' list in federal elections came from the provincial election's voters' list, and so the federal franchise was also blocked. The federal Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 also known as the \"Chinese Exclusion Act\", was repealed after World War II on 1947 May 14, and he then voted again in the next federal election in 1949 -- making him the only Chinese person to have voted both before and after the disenfranchisement. A photo of him voting has been reprinted many times.\n\nActive in the Vancouver's Chinese community, he was founder of the Chinese Empire Reform Association (an organization of overseas Chinese, active mostly between 1899 and 1911, made up of mostly the older, more prosperous Chinese merchants in Canada, and supporting the modernization of China through progressive reforms within the framework of a constitutional monarchy rather than by armed revolution), and a president of the Chinese Benevolent Association. Chinese merchants had formed the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, with the first branch in Victoria in 1884 and the second one in Vancouver in 1895. The Association was mandatory for all Chinese in the area to join, and it did everything from representing members in legal disputes to sending the remains of a member who died back to his or her ancestral homeland in China.\n\nWon Cumyow married Ye Eva Chan 1889 November 29. A Chinese Methodist missionary family had adopted her and brought her to Canada from Hong Kong in 1888. Together Won Cumyow and Ye Eva had ten children. Their third son, Gordon Won Cumyow, took over the position of court interpreter and became the first Chinese notary public in Canada. Won Alexander Cumyow died on October 6, 1955, in Vancouver.\n\n"}
