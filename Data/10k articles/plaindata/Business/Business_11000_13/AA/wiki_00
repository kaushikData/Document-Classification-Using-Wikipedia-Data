He was educated in his native city where G. Mazzatinti introduced him to librarianship. He then studied at the Faculty of Letters in the University of Bologna, graduating in 1907.\n\nImmediately after graduating, he joined a group of intellectuals associated with the journal \"La Romagna nella storia, nella letteratura e nelle arti\", becoming its editor in 1911. He took a special interest in the social and economic history of the region, publishing accounts of developments from the 16th to the 18th centuries. At the same time, he took up teaching, first at the high school in Rimini, then at Alatri (1909) and Chieri (1912). During the First World War, he enlisted in the artillery until April 1919 when he was discharged with the rank of captain.\n\nImmediately after the war he moved to Milan where he gave up teaching in favour of a business career, becoming the Italian agent for American chemicals producers including Dupont de Nemours and founding his own company, Dott. Aldo Garzanti Coloranti et Prodotti Chimici, a distribution outlet supplying the textile and leather industries. As a result of his success, in 1921 he was able to open his own manufacturing company, SADAF, which produced dyes and chemicals for soaking and tanning hides and leathers. In 1932, he widened his interests, opening MIRET specializing in lace and silk. The following year he created a model agricultural enterprise in Suvignano, Tuscany but above all, in 1936, he acquired the Treves publishing company which was in difficulty. Created in 1861 by Emilio Treves, Fratelli Treves Editori had been a leading publisher not only in Lombardy but throughout Italy. After changing its name to Casa Editrice Garzanti, he received support from Benito Mussolini which brought him lucrative commissions from the library authorities, making it one of the top publishing companies in Italy.\n\nThe company suffered during the Second World War when the old Treves printing plant was bombed but Garzanti was successful in rebuilding modern facilities within a year, winning the Roncoroni prize for rapid redevelopment. In 1952, suffering from poor health, he retired as managing director of the company but remained chairman of the board.\n\nIn later life, Garzanti devoted his efforts mainly to philanthropic activities, contributing to the restoration of the castle Rocca Caterina Sforza in Forlì and assisting artists through the Fondazione Livio e Maria Garzanti. In 1954, he financed the Italian expedition which successfully climbed K2. He died in 1961 at the age of 78.\n\nIn 1920, Garzanti married Maria Ravasi who gave birth to their son Livio in 1921. Livio later took over the family publishing business.\n"}

He became the president of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in February 2006. He has worked as the managing director and CEO of Africa Technology and Business Institute since September 2003. Under a September 2008 power-sharing agreement, Mutambara served in the government as one of two Deputy Prime Ministers from 2009 to 2013.\n\nMutambara was president of the Student Representative Council of the University of Zimbabwe in 1988 and 1989. He led anti-government protests at the University of Zimbabwe which led to his arrest and imprisonment. He was later educated on a Rhodes Scholarship in 1991, at Merton College, Oxford in the United Kingdom where he obtained a DPhil in Robotics and Mechatronics, and in the United States where he spent time as a visiting Fellow in the same field, including both California Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Florida A & M University – Florida State University College of Engineering. He also worked as a lecturer on Business Strategy and as a consultant for McKinsey & Company.\n\nMutambara criticised government ministers for abusing Zimbabwe's land reform program, engaging in: \"monopolistic politics of domination, corruption, and petty bourgeois accumulation.\"\n\nMutambara, a self-professed admirer of Che Guevara, has also expressed his intention to visit Cuba to learn more about its \"successful resistance\" to American sanctions. Mutambara added: \"We have a lot to learn from Cuba which started its revolution in 1959, we will continue with our solidarity, continue with the struggle and strengthen our co-operation.\"\n\nFrom March of 2002 to September of 2003, Mutambara was a professor of Operations Management at the University of South Africa's School of Business Leadership. Mutambara has authored at least two books. His most cited paper, of his at least thriteen papers, is entitled \"Estimation and control for a modular wheeled mobile robot\" co-authored with Professor Hugh F. Durrant-Whyte. According to Scopus as of 2013 his h-index was a modest 4.\n\nIn 2005 the MDC split into two factions following a dispute over whether or not to participate in the March 2005 senatorial election. While MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, Mutambara, and others opposed participation, Welshman Ncube and Gibson Sibanda led a faction that favoured participation. Those supporting the senate elections won narrowly against the leader Morgan Tsvangirai's vote. Tsvangirai later overruled and overturned the decision of the plebiscite citing two absent members had sent in postal votes that canceled the slender margin.\n\nIn February 2006 at a Congress of the breakaway faction Movement for Democratic Change, Mutambara was elected as president of the party. Commenting on the election, Mutambara said, \"My position was that the MDC should have boycotted those Senate elections. I guess then that makes me the anti-Senate leader of the pro-Senate MDC faction. How ridiculous can we get? That debate is now in the past, let us move on and unite our people.\"\n\nThe choice of Mutambara as leader was said to have been inspired by the fact that he is a Shona whereas Sibanda and Ncube are both Ndebele, but realised that only a Shona candidate could win an election across the whole of Zimbabwe. Mutambara is not a member of the House of Assembly. \n\nThe faction led by Tsvangirai described Mutambara's election as a nullity. In his MDC faction presidential acceptance speech, Mutambara stated, \"We believe that our views on land reform in Zimbabwe are different from those of Western governments. Our approach is not driven by the interests of white farmers, but by those of all Zimbabweans, white and black. While we put the failure of the land reform program squarely on the ZANU–PF government, we also acknowledge the complicity of some Western governments which reneged on agreements, and the inertia of white farmers in seeking pre-emptive solutions.\" However, David Karimanzira, a leading member of the ZANU–PF, alleged that Mutambara was promoted by the West after Western governments decided not to continue backing Morgan Tsvangirai because the Zimbabwean people had allegedly rejected his party manifesto. He once called the African Union a \"club of dictators\".\n\nMutambara was arrested by the Zimbabwe police on 19 May 2006 while leading a march in support of his faction's candidate on the eve of the Budiriro by-election. He was also arrested on 11 March together with other MDC leaders from the other faction. He was released without charge two days later, only to be re-arrested on 18 March at Harare Airport en route to South Africa, where his family is still based, and where he is also a leading consultant. He was also released without charge after three days in custody.\n\nAfter Mutambara and Tsvangirai failed to unite on a single MDC candidate for the March 2008 presidential election, Mutambara said on 15 February that he would not run for president and that his faction would instead back Simba Makoni. Mutambara instead ran in the concurrent parliamentary election for a seat from the Zengeza East constituency, but he was placed third, with 1,322 votes, according to official results, behind the candidate of the Tsvangirai faction, who won 7,570 votes, and the ZANU–PF candidate, who won 3,042 votes.\n\nThe Tsvangirai faction won 99 seats in the parliamentary election and the Mutambara faction won 10, compared with 97 for ZANU–PF. On 28 April 2008, Mutambara and Tsvangirai announced that their factions were reuniting, thus enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority.\n\nOn 1 June 2008, Mutambara was arrested at his home in Harare. According to his lawyer, the arrest was due to an article he wrote in \"The Standard\" in April, which allegedly included \"falsehoods\" and \"contempt of court\". In this article, he blamed Mugabe for the state of the economy and accused the security forces of committing abuses. On 3 June, Mutambara was released on a bail of 20 million Zimbabwean dollars but he did not go to jail, with the next court date being set for 17 June. After the hearing on 3 June, he described his own suffering as minor compared to that of the people, saying that Mugabe's \"human rights violations\" would fail and vowing, \"We will triumph over evil.\"\n\nOn 15 September 2008, the leaders of the 14-member Southern African Development Community witnessed the signing of a power-sharing agreement between the two MDC factions and ZANU-PF. Under the deal, Mugabe remained president, Tsvangirai became prime minister, the MDC controlled the police, ZANU-PF controlled the Army, and Mutambara became deputy prime minister.\n\n"}

The Lady Luck structure has been a blight.\"\n\nAs of July 2009, Goodman once again said in a council meeting that \"The Lady Luck is a disaster,\" and then called the skeletal structure a \"carcass\". Las Vegas city leaders wanted CIM Group to raze the unfinished structure at Fourth Street and Stewart Avenue and do a better job of keeping sidewalks and landscaping clean near the site. CIM had until late December 2009 to begin a $100 million renovation of the Lady Luck; otherwise, it would potentially lose an offer from the city which would hand over land around the proposed nearby Mob Museum.\n\nOn July 23, 2009, some demolition work started on a 4-story concrete building adjacent to the main resort. This work was completed in accordance with the city's request for CIM Group to raze the condemned structure.\n\nOn March 15, 2010, CIM Group made an agreement with city officials to have the renovations completed by December 31, 2011. There was the potential that the hotel/casino would reopen in 2012, five years after its originally scheduled reopening in 2007.\n\nIn October 2011, plans were announced to rename the Lady Luck to the Downtown Grand. The property underwent a $100 million renovation. Construction of Downtown3rd on the former site of the Lady Luck began in the fall of 2011. The new Downtown Grand Hotel and Casino was scheduled to open in late 2013, and the remainder of Downtown3rd was expected to be completed in late 2014.\n\nThe new Downtown Grand opened on October 27, 2013. It is a boutique hotel and casino with of casino space, 629 newly remodeled hotel rooms, 9 bars & restaurants and a 35,000 square foot urban rooftop pool retreat called Citrus.\n"}

The project is being implemented through a partnership between the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the Durban Investment Promotion Agency (DIPA), the eThekwini Municipality and the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI).\n\nThe purpose of the project is to sensitise industry in Durban to the risks and opportunities associated with climate change by creating a platform through which learning and communication between industry and government can take place. The project aims to establish a sustained partnership between the various industries organisations in Durban and the eThekwini Municipality. The partnership is seen as fundamental to responding to climate change and effectively contributing towards climate change mitigation and adaptation within the Durban metropolitan area.\n\nThe partnership covers three core areas. These are: industry specific interventions; institutional support and; outreach. Specific actions within these core areas assist the partnership in fulfilling its assigned purpose.\n\nAs part of the first core area, industry specific interventions, engagement with three main existing structures within Durban's industries is seen as critical to the success of the project. These existing industry structures or groupings are: the Durban Automotive Cluster; the Durban Chemical Cluster (DCC) and; the eThekwini Maritime and Logistics Cluster (EMLC).\n\nThese industries are brought together and a process of learning, through the conducting of a number of forums by the DICCPP is realised. These forums designed specifically for the local industry cover issues such as greenhouse gas (GHG) assessments (which include carbon footprint calculations, life cycle and supply chain analysis and emission target development); financial implications or opportunities (which include information on carbon taxes, the carbon market, funding streams and investment opportunities); new technologies in renewable energy; waste management and finally; climate change response strategies.,\n\nThe second core area of the DICCPP is providing an institutional support mechanism for actively driving and monitoring industry climate change response activities in Durban. In this regard, the DICCPP is working closely with the eThekwini Energy Office to develop a climate change mitigation competency in the municipal structure.\n\nThe third core area of the DICCPP is called outreach and this is seen as an important part of the project in that it seeks to creates an awareness about climate change issues. A 'carbon footprint video' is being developed within the eThekwini communications department and serves to assist industry to quantify their carbon footprint. The DICCPP is also working with the Imagine Durban team running an Electricity Saving Competition within business in the city.\n\nThe project's ultimate strategy is to establish a forum for industry to meet regularly to discuss climate change mitigation and adaptation activities. In doing so, this will facilitate investment and technology transfer between Durban and a similar project in China (also implemented by UNIDO). Once this has been established, it is envisaged that regular meetings with the government and other stakeholders will take place.\n\n\n"}

Santanu Choudhury, blogging for \"The Wall Street Journal\", noted that the Multix was both small enough to give buyers the maneuverability needed for narrow or congested streets, and equipped to handle adverse road conditions including severe ruts and minor flooding. He also praised the possibilities opened up by the Multix's power generation capability, suggesting it could be used \"to light up homes, power tools or even run a DJ console.\"\n\n\"Multix AX+\"\n\n"}

As such it is a kind of \"overdraft\" implying a positive balance sheet that does not really exist. Sometimes the term fiscal backpedaling is used.\n\nThe term gained popularity with the Brazilian Presidential election of 2014, in which President Rousseff was reelected. She was later accused of fiscal pedaling during the campaign, for allowing this delay in repayment to government-owned banks by the (Brazilian Treasury) which is also the entity which oversees these banks. Her opponents argued that this amounted to undeclared loans by these banks to the Treasury, which is prohibited by the Brazilian Constitution and a violation of the . This led to the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff beginning in 2015 on multiple charges including fiscal pedaling, and her subsequent removal from office a year later..\n\nOne possible motivation for fiscal pedaling is political advantage, in that it permits a government to conceal the true extent of its fiscal obligations during a political campaign. President Rousseff's government was accused of using these accounting techniques during the bitterly fought campaign of 2014, with the funding thus obtained allegedly used to support programs for the poor, credits to farmers, and subsidies for low-income housing. Supporters claimed this was standard practice in Brazil and had been engaged in by previous Presidents, and that the opposition to her was purely political.\n\n"}

It is an empirically derived standard value for the electrical conductivity of commercially available copper.\n\nSometime around 1913 several copper samples from 14 important refiners and wire manufacturers were analyzed by the U.S. Bureau of Standards. The average resistance of the samples was determined to be 0.15292 Ω for copper wires with a mass of 1 gram of uniform cross section and 1 meter in length at 20 °C. In the United States this is usually written as \"0.15292 ohm (meter, gram) at 20 °C\".\n\nGermany proposed a slight modification of this value to \"0.15328 ohm (meter, gram) at 20 °C\", this being equivalent to a conductivity of exactly at 20 °C. The German modification was adopted by the International Electrotechnical Commission in 1913 and subsequently published by the United States Department of Commerce on October 1, 1914 as the International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS).\n\nThe standard is most often used as a comparative property in the specification of the conductivity of other metals. For example, the conductivity of a particular grade of titanium may be specified as 1.2 % IACS, meaning that its electrical conductivity is 1.2 % of the copper specified as the IACS standard.\n\nThe standard can be found at https://archive.org/stream/copperwiretables31unituoft#page/n0/mode/1up.\n\nHeat treatment will alter several properties of an alloy, many of which are important to a design engineer. A measurement of the electric conductivity of aluminum alloys can be used to verify that a heat treatment process has been done correctly.\nFor example a component made of \"7075\" alloy which was correctly treated with the process \"T73\" to gain resistance to stress corrosion cracking will fall in the range of 38.0 to 43.0 % IACS.\n\nThe acceptance criteria for electrical conductivity of finished or semi-finished parts of wrought aluminum alloys are contained in SAE International specification AMS2658 Hardness and Conductivity Inspection of Wrought Aluminum Alloy Parts. Here the values are given in reference to the IACS.\n\nA method for measuring electrical conductivity is described in ASTM International specification ASTM E 1004 Electromagnetic (Eddy-Current) Measurements of Electrical Conductivity.

Uygur and Kulinski are no longer affiliated with the group. The organization formed as a result of the 2016 United States presidential election and has a stated goal of reforming the Democratic Party by running \"a unified campaign to replace every corporate-backed member of Congress and rebuild the Democratic Party from scratch\" starting in the 2018 congressional midterm elections.\n\nJustice Democrats describes its views as being held by most Americans, but deemed \"politically impossible\" by the current political establishment because of systemic political corruption. They comment that as all campaigns need donations and that candidates who hold policies viewed as unfavorable by corporate interests and wealthy individuals will be denied funding by corporations. Therefore the system actually ends up forcing politicians to change their policies to suit the current business environment.\n\nIn the 2018 election, 26 of the 79 candidates endorsed by Justice Democrats won their respective primary elections. Seven of these candidates won in the general election: Raúl Grijalva, Ro Khanna, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Pramila Jayapal. Districts won ranged from D+13 to D+34 on the Cook PVI, meaning solid Democrat. No swing districts were won.\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential election resulted in a victory for Donald Trump, many progressives pointed to the perceived loyalty of politicians to large donors as a major contributing factor to Clinton's loss to Trump. These critics contend that a campaign finance model more similar to that of Bernie Sanders, whose 2016 presidential campaign was funded by small individual donations, will increase public trust in politicians and accountability to constituents.\n\nOn January 23, 2017, Cenk Uygur and Kyle Kulinski founded Justice Democrats with ten others, including former staffers from the Sanders campaign such as its Director of Organizing Technology, Saikat Chakrabarti, and MoveOn.org fundraiser Zack Exley. According to the organization, they seek to create a left-wing populist movement to support alternative Democratic candidates beginning with the 2018 mid-term elections, in order to either defeat the incumbent Democrats or cause them to become accountable to their constituents. They require their candidates to take a pledge to refuse financial contributions from billionaires and corporations. In addition, they hope to rebuild the Democratic Party on a national level and to defeat President Trump if he runs for re-election in 2020.\n\nJustice Democrats announced in March 2017 they had teamed up with Brand New Congress, a PAC established by former Sanders campaign supporters, to further their goals.\n\nAs of March 20, 2017, Justice Democrats have reported they have received 8,300 nominations and raised $1 million.\n\nRepresentative Ro Khanna of California's 17th congressional district announced on May 9, 2017, that he had become a Justice Democrat, and the first sitting member of Congress to join the organization. On November 1, 2017, Justice Democrats announced on social media that fellow progressive group AllOfUs had merged with the group.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, it was announced that Uygur had resigned from his position at the organization, following the revelation of previously deleted but archived controversial blog posts he had written when he was a Republican almost two decades earlier that were featured in a report by \"TheWrap\" that were reported to have been posted in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Uygur apologized the day prior and revealed that he deleted the \"ugly\" posts over a decade ago because he no longer stood by those principles. The following day, Kulinski announced that he had stepped down from the organization as he disagreed with the opinions of the Justice Democrats staff members that pressed for Uygur's dismissal over the blog posts. He said his decision came as a result of a personal dilemma as he saw the posts in question upon re-reading them as being satirical due to them dealing with Uygur complaining about his inability to attract women. Kulinski noted that the decision to ask for Uygur's resignation came from the Justice Democrats staff, not the candidates, and as such he asked his supporters to continue backing the organization's candidates.\n\nAccording to Justice Democrats, their highest priority is to effectively eliminate the role of money and conflicts of interests in politics, and the group's only litmus test is that candidates decline to accept money from PACs. They wish to pass a constitutional amendment to \"put an end to Washington corruption and bring about election reform\". They support the idea of publicly funded elections, banning Super PACs as well as banning private donations to politicians and campaigns. In addition, they advocate the reinstatement of provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and a ban on gerrymandering for partisan gain. As a core policy, any candidate running with Justice Democrats must pledge to refuse any donations from billionaires or corporations. They plan to call a constitutional convention.\n\nIn addition, their platform encourages many progressive priorities, such as:\n\nAs of August 22, 2018, there are 79 current candidates officially endorsed by Justice Democrats.\n\nSeveral progressive organizations, including Our Revolution, Democratic Socialists of America, National Nurses United, Working Families Party, and Brand New Congress, announced in July 2017 a push to encourage House Democrats to sign on to a #PeoplesPlatform, which consists of supporting \"eight bills currently in the House of Representatives that will address the concerns of everyday Americans.\" These eight bills and the topics they address are:\n\n\nRo Khanna of California's 17th congressional district announced on May 9, 2017 that he is a member of Justice Democrats and supports the organization's agenda. On December 6, 2017, Justice Democrats announced that Raul Grijalva of Arizona's 3rd congressional district had joined the group.\n\nJustice Democrats pushed for Keith Ellison of Minnesota's 5th congressional district to run for the Senate seat once occupied by Senator Al Franken. Ellison declined to run for the Senate seat. Ellison, Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee, has not announced whether or not he supports Justice Democrats, and has left Congressional politics, running for, and winning, the 2018 Minnesota Attorney General election.\n\nOn April 16, 2018, Justice Democrats announced that Pramila Jayapal of Washington's 7th congressional district had joined the group.\n\n\n"}

The company is most famous for having built the town of Levittown, New York. The company's designs and building practices revolutionized the home building industry and altered the north eastern landscape of the United States with massive suburban communities.\n\nLevitt & Sons was America's biggest home builder by 1951, and William Levitt was named one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. Historian Kenneth T. Jackson wrote of Levitt & Sons, \"The family that had the greatest impact on postwar housing in the United States was Abraham Levitt and his sons, William and Alfred, who ultimately built more than 140,000 houses and turned a cottage industry into a major manufacturing process.\"\n\nAbraham Levitt founded a real-estate development company near the start of the Great Depression. His son William became company president at the age of 22, handling the advertising, sales, and financing. Alfred Levitt, still a teenager, became vice president of design and drafted plans for the first Levitt house, a six bedroom, two bathroom Tudor style home that sold for over $14,000 in 1929 (roughly $ today). The Levitts sold 600 of these upper middle-class homes, part of the Strathmore project, in four years during the Great Depression.\n\nWilliam earned a reputation as the person to see for high-end, custom homes on Long Island's North Shore, called the Gold Coast. Prior to World War II, Levitt & Sons built mostly upscale housing on and around Long Island, New York. During the 1930s, they built the North Strathmore community at Manhasset, New York, on the former Onderdonk farm. The North Strathmore homes sold for $9,100 to $18,500. The Levitts built another 1,200 homes in Manhasset, Great Neck, and Westchester County. Radio stars, prominent journalists, surgeons, business people, and lawyers bought the upscale Levitt houses.\n\nAfter World War II, America's post-war prosperity and baby boom had created a crisis of affordable housing, especially for returning veterans. Levitt & Sons chose an area known as Island Trees near Hempstead, Long Island, as the site for a huge building project for housing these veterans. The company named it Levittown. \n\nThe community was planned to have 6,000 low-priced homes, making it much larger than any other U.S. development. The company bought of potato farms on Long Island. On July 1, 1947, Levitt & Sons broke ground on the $50 million ($ million today) development of Levittown, which ultimately included 17,000 homes on 7.3 square miles of land. Alfred created the mass production techniques and designed the homes and the layout of the development, with its curving streets. Abraham directed the landscaping, whose focus was two trees to each front yard, all planted exactly the same distance apart. William was the financier and promoter, who persuaded lawmakers to rewrite the laws that made Levittown possible. The houses, which were in the Cape Cod and ranch house styles, sat on a seventh-acre (0.06 ha) lot. They had with two bedrooms, a living room with a television and a kitchen with modern appliances, an unfinished second floor and no garage. \n\nLevitt's innovation in creating this planned community was to build the houses in the manner of an assembly line. In normal assembly lines, the workers stay stationary and the product moves down the line; in Levitt's homebuilding assembly line, the product—the houses—stayed in place and specialized workers moved from house to house. The assembly line construction method allowed Levittown to be constructed more efficiently than other development at the time, with teams of specialized workers following each other from house to house to complete incremental steps in the construction. Levitt also reduced costs by freezing out union labor – a move which provoked picket lines – enabling him to use the latest technology, such as spray painting. He also cut out middlemen and purchased many items, including lumber and televisions, directly from manufacturers, as well as constructing his own factory to produce nails. The building of every house was reduced to 26 steps, and sub-contractors were responsible for each step. \n\nDuring the project, Levitt & Sons emphasized speed, efficiency, and cost-effective construction; these methods led to a production rate of 30 houses a day by July 1948. The mass production of thousands of houses at virtually the same time allowed the company to sell them for as little as $8,000 each ($65,000 in 2009 dollars), which, with the G.I. Bill and Federal housing subsidies, reduced the up-front cost of a house to many buyers to around $400. \n\nLevitt & Sons was the cover story in \"Time\" magazine for July 3, 1950. William Levitt was pictured on the cover, with the tag line \"For Sale: a new way of life.\"\n\nAs well as a symbol of the American Dream, Levittown would also become a symbol of racial segregation, due to Clause 25 of the standard lease agreement signed by the first residents of Levittown, who had an option to buy their homes. This \"restrictive covenant\" stated in capital letters and bold type that the house could not \"be used or occupied by any person other than members of the Caucasian race.\"\n\nSuch discriminatory housing standards were consistent with government policies of the time. The Federal Housing Administration allowed developers to justify segregation within public housing. The FHA only offered mortgages to non-mixed developments which discouraged developers from creating racially integrated housing. Before the sale of Levittown homes began, the sales agents were aware that no applications from black families would be accepted. As a result, American veterans who wished to purchase a home in Levittown were unable to do so if they were black.\n\nWilliam Levitt attempted to justify their decision to only sell homes to white families by saying that it was in the best interest for business. He claimed their actions were not discriminatory but intended to maintain the value of their properties. The company explained that it was not possible to reduce racial segregation while they were attempting to reduce the housing shortage. Levvitt said \"As a Jew, I have no room in my heart for racial prejudice. But the plain fact is that most whites prefer not to live in mixed communities. This attitude may be wrong morally, and someday it may change. I hope it will.\" The Levitts explained that they would open up applications to blacks after they had sold as many homes to white people as possible. They believed that potential white buyers would not want to buy a house in Levittown if they were aware that they would have black neighbors.\n\nThough the Levitts were Jewish, they did not wish to sell homes to Jewish families either; despite this, by 1960, although it was still a completely \"white\" suburb, the population of Levittown was roughly a third Jewish, with the remainder about a third Roman Catholic, and a third Protestant. \n\nAn opposition group was formed, the Committee to End Discrimination in Levittown, to protest the restricted sale of Levittown homes, and to push for an integrated community. In 1948 a ruling in another case by the United States Supreme Court declared that property deeds stipulating racial segregation were \"unenforceable as law and contrary to public policy\". Only well after the 1954 racial integration decisions, including \"Brown v. Board of Education\", was Levittown racially integrated, and even as late as the 1990 census only a tiny fraction of the community was non-white, a stigma that still exists until this day.\n\nThe Levitts went on to plan and build another community of more than 17,000 homes in Levittown, Pennsylvania, which saw its first residents in 1952. Willingboro, New Jersey, was built as a Levittown in 1958, and bears several Levittown-specific street names such as Levitt Parkway.\n\nDiscord in the Levitt family caused a split in 1954. Alfred left the company, and William took full control of Levitt & Sons. During the late 1950s, Levitt and Sons developed the community known as \"Belair at Bowie,\" in Bowie, Maryland. In 1957 they acquired the historic Belair Mansion and estate, home of Maryland's colonial Governor Samuel Ogle and his Belair Stables. In 1959 the community was annexed by Bowie.\n\nThe company went public in 1960. Through the 1960s, the Levitts constructed houses in six Eastern states.\n\nIn 1961, the company started development in Aberdeen, New Jersey (formerly Matawan Township), known as \"Strathmore at Matawan.\" the Strathmore name had originally been used by Levitt & Sons in its upper middle class developments on Long Island in the 1930s. Levittown, Puerto Rico, built in the 1960s, was a Levitt project. In 1966, Levitt & Sons built a development in Somerset, New Jersey, and in 1966–72, it built another development in Greenbriar, Virginia. In 1967, the company developed Montpelier, near Laurel, Maryland.\n\nLevitt & Sons even went international. The company built a large development near Paris at Lésigny in Seine-et-Marne, and at Mennecy in Essonne, France. By the late 1960s, Levitt & Sons had built more than 140,000 houses.\n\nLevitt & Sons was sold to ITT in 1964 for a reported $90 million ($ million today). The company continued to build housing developments as an ITT subsidiary, under a variety of names that usually included \"Levitt\". Development in Florida started two years later.\n\nIn the United States, Levitt houses were built in the states of Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, as well as in Puerto Rico. Around the world, Levitt houses were built in Canada, France, and Spain.\n\nStarrett Housing Corporation purchased ITT's Levitt subsidiary in 1979. Houses continued to be built in Florida, Illinois, New York, and Virginia. A completely separate company called Levitt Homes Corp. operated in Puerto Rico during the 1980s.\n\nLevitt was sold to BankAtlantic in 1999. In 2003, Levitt was established as independent entity from BankAtlantic.\n\nLevitt & Sons were restricted to building in Florida alone by the 2000s. Levitt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2007 as a result of the housing crash. The parent company was renamed in 2008 to Woodbridge Holdings Corporation, which shortly ceased trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n"}

As Beckhard said in the preface to his seminal work:\n... in our rapidly changing environment, new organization forms must be developed; more effective goal-setting and planning processes must be learned, and practiced teams of independent people must spend real time improving their methods of working, decision-making and communicating. Competing or conflicting groups must move towards a collaborative way of work. In order for these changes to occur and be maintained, \"a planned\", managed change effort is necessary - a program of \"organizational development\".\nThis was written in 1969 and while much has been learnt it is just as true today.\n\nSince the beginnings of organizational development as a profession, diagnosis has moved from the purely behavioral towards a strategic and holistic business diagnostic approach, and from looking at human interventions in isolation to exploring the interactions of people in the context in which they operate. As organizations are more collaborative in nature, the traditional silo approach to diagnostics is becoming increasingly rare. Organizational development and in particular the diagnostic phase of activities is spreading from the occupational psychologists towards mainstream business. This is important for OD practitioners as the role is increasingly holistic.\n\nThe following models have been introduced for organizational diagnosis:\n\nAll models are based on open system (Open System Theory, OST): From the General System Theory defined by Von Bertalaffy (a system complex of interacting elements), Katz and Kahn (1978) apply the concept of Open System Theory (OST), looking at the relationship between the organizations and the environment in which they are involved. This focus reflects on the organization's ability to adapt to changes in environment conditions (with or without the need for information processing). (Boulding, 1956; Katz and Kahn, 1978)\n\nThe organizational diagnostic phase is often integrated within an overall OD process, commonly called 'a consulting process'.

{"id": "46393834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46393834", "title": "Overwork", "text": "Overwork\n\nOverwork is the expression used to define the cause of working too hard, too much, or too long. It can be also related to the act of working beyond one's strength or capacity, causing physical and/or mental distress in the process.\n\nCompulsory, mandatory, or forced overtime is usually defined as hours worked in excess of forty hours per week “that the employer makes compulsory with the threat of job loss or the threat of other reprisals such as demotion or assignment to unattractive tasks or work shifts.\"\n\nVoluntary overtime is work which the employer may ask the worker to do but which the worker is not required to work unless he agrees at the time to do so.\n\nCompulsory overwork is that where the individual has no choice but to work more than their capacity. In other words, compulsory overwork is the lack of control that workers exercise over the boundary between work time and private time.\n\nForced overtime, heavy workloads, and frenetic work paces give rise to debilitating repetitive stress injuries, on-the-job accidents, over-exposure to toxic substances, and other dangerous work conditions. Nevertheless, some studies are beginning to show the costs of compulsory overwork. Reg Williams and Patricia Strasser, professors of nursing at the University of Michigan, estimated in the journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses that the total cost of depression at work was as high as $44 billion. They pointed out that healthcare workers have focused much attention on the workplace risk factors for heart disease, cancer, obesity, and other illnesses, but little emphasis on the risk factors for depression, stress, negative changes in personal life, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships.\n\nAnnual average work hours for Americans have risen from 1,679 in 1973 to 1,878 in 2000. This represents an increase of 199 hours—or approximately five additional weeks of work per year. This total work effort represents an average of nine weeks more than European workers. Therefore, it is within this logic of working more to gain more that workers are living a very hectic and tiring time to provide their families. The result in reality is an excess that does not often translate into high salaries. There are categories of workers where the work and the environments are unhealthy turning the most vulnerable workers and sentenced to fatigue and even living less.\n\nThe emotional impacts of overwork can vary, depending on the amount of work, levels of pressure and competition in the work space. Employees who worry about not getting work finished and keeping up a fast pace can feel like they are drowning in their workload, a feeling that manifests itself in chronic stress and anxiety, which can hebetate the spirit and create tension in personal and work relationships. The behavior continues even if the worker becomes aware that it is personally harmful — even harmful to the quality of the work. The stress that goes along with working too much has been shown to lead to substance abuse, sleep disorders, anxiety and ultimately to physical problems.\n\nOne of the key indicators that an individual is being overworked, and not merely challenged, is if work-related stress begins to take a toll on their physical health and general lifestyle. It is easy to distinguish different types of physical symptoms, such as getting sick frequently due to a weakened immune system, depression and insomnia. All these symptoms can cause more fatigue-related errors at work and affect their personal lives.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, other physical symptoms may include headache, neck pain, lower back pain, depression, changes to appetite and chronic fatigue.\n\nCompulsory overtime and overwork present a growing \"convergence\" between workers regardless of their occupation, income, education, race, gender, or citizenship. For example, in the United States, immigrants and other low-wage workers toil excessive hours in traditional sweatshops, such as garment factories, restaurants and other industry sectors. At the same time, exposés of \"white-collar\" and \"electronic\" sweatshops debunk the glamour of high-tech employment revealing large numbers of higher-paid skilled workers who work upwards of seventy to ninety hours a week under increasingly autocratic conditions.\n\nWith the steep rise in annual work hours for individuals and families, more than half of American workers report feeling overworked, overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do, and/or lacking in time to reflect upon the work they are doing. Overwork is attributable to several trends. First, the climb in annual family work hours since 1979 has coincided with an era of stagnant and falling wages. Annual family work hours have swelled primarily because unprecedented numbers of women have entered the full-time workforce, and those who were already in the workforce have taken on increased hours of work to boost family incomes. Without the increased work hours of women, lower-and middle-income families would have seen their incomes fall or at best remain stagnant. African American and Latino families, whose average hours of work grew faster than white families throughout the 1980s and 1990s, would have been especially hard hit.\n\nMany immigrant workers are faced with the stark choice of complying with required overtime, increased workloads, and frenetic work paces, or being fired. Workers are pressured to compete with one another for longer hours to keep their jobs and avoid being replaced by workers who are more compliant with employer demands. Undocumented immigrant workers are particularly susceptible to demands for excessive hours. The threat of deportation, along with the criminalization of their work status, creates a climate of vulnerability that unscrupulous employers use to cheapen labor and extract more work.\n\nThe problem of overwork in Japan has become so acute that the term \"karōshi\", literally means ‘death by overwork’ was coined a few years ago. The government estimates that 200 people die from \"karōshi\" every year because of heart attacks or cerebral hemorrhages due to long hours spent at the work place. However, \"karōshi\" does not include deaths from mental depression or suicides. If this was the case, the number of work related deaths would dramatically increase. Data compiled by the Japanese government shows that 22 percent of the public work more than 49 hours a week, compared to 11 percent of French and Germans.\n\nWorkers typically used less than half of their leave allowance in a year, according to a survey by the labour ministry which found that in 2013 employees took only nine of their 18.5 days average entitlement. A separate poll showed that one in every six workers took no paid holidays at all in 2013. In early discussions, employer groups proposed limiting the number of compulsory paid holidays to three days, while unions called for eight.\n\nIn 2016, the Japanese government finally decided to do something about the endemic culture of overwork, which has been blamed not just on a growing number of deaths, but also the country's critically low birth rate and declining productivity. Although Japan is notorious for hard work, it's equally known for inefficiency and bureaucracy. Workers sit around in the name of team spirit, despite questionable performance.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29333452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29333452", "title": "Referee in Bankruptcy", "text": "Referee in Bankruptcy\n\nA Referee in Bankruptcy or Bankruptcy Referee was a federal official with quasi-judicial powers, appointed by a United States district court to administer bankruptcy proceedings, prior to 1979. The office was first created by the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and was abolished by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, which created separate United States bankruptcy courts with permanently assigned judges. \n\nThe Bankruptcy Act of 1898 established the position of bankruptcy referee \"to assist in expeditiously transacting the bankruptcy business\". The act specified that referees were to be appointed by the district court for a term of two years, although they could be removed from office or have their jurisdiction over a particular case revoked at any time. The courts could appoint the referees in such numbers \"as may be necessary\". The fees paid by petitioners in bankruptcy proceedings were used to compensate the referees.\n\nAll three earlier, short-lived acts providing for bankruptcy jurisdiction in the federal courts had made provision for the appointment of officers to assist in the administration of bankruptcy cases. The act of 1800 authorized district judges to appoint commissioners with various powers to declare a person a bankrupt, to take possession of a bankrupt's estate, and to assign the bankrupt's property. The next bankruptcy act, in 1841 provided for the appointment of commissioners to receive proof of debts and carry out other administrative duties related to bankruptcy cases. The Act that governed federal bankruptcy from 1867 to 1878 instructed district judges to appoint registers in bankruptcy, who would be nominated by the Chief Justice and assist the judges in a wide range of tasks related to bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nBankruptcy referees appointed under the Act of 1898 performed a wide range of judicial and administrative functions during the early part of the twentieth century, including the following: the consideration and adjudication of bankruptcy petitions submitted to the district courts; the examination of property schedules and lists of creditors filed by bankrupts; the administering of oaths and depositions to witnesses in bankruptcy proceedings; the maintenance of the records in such proceedings and the transmission of such records to the clerk of court; and the distribution of the property of bankrupts in cases where the district court judge was absent. Referees' decisions on substantive matters were subject to review by the district court.\n\nSuch duties made each referee a combination of special master and estate administrator until the late 1930s, when Congress transferred many of their administrative functions to bankruptcy trustees or clerks of court and increased the referees' judicial functions. The Chandler Act of 1938 granted referees the authority to adjudicate petitions referred to them, to administer oaths and examine witnesses, and to act for the judge in certain instances.\n\nIn 1946, Congress provided a fixed salary for referees, increased their tenure from two to six years, and limited the circumstances under which they could be removed from office to incompetence, misconduct, or neglect of duty. In 1973 the Supreme Court acknowledged the increasingly judicial nature of the referees' work when it prescribed a set of bankruptcy rules that employed the term \"bankruptcy judge\" interchangeably with \"referee\".\n\nIn the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 Congress enacted the current U.S. Bankruptcy Code, abolished the office of bankruptcy referee and established bankruptcy judgeships to serve separate bankruptcy courts in each judicial district. While these judges assumed the referees' judicial duties, the remaining administrative functions in most districts were transferred to trustees whose offices were placed under the supervision of the Department of Justice.\n\n\n"}

His grandfather Michael O'Rahilly (The O'Rahilly) was an important figure in the quest for the independence of Ireland, a leader in the Easter Rising, who died in the fighting in Dublin in April 1916. \n\nPrior to his involvement with Radio Caroline, O'Rahilly ran the Scene club in London's Soho district and managed a number of pop music artists, including Georgie Fame and Alexis Korner. He recorded a Georgie Fame record on his own independent label, unheard of at the time. He took the record to the BBC to try to get it played. He discovered that the record industry was dominated by EMI and Decca. He then tried to get it played on Radio Luxembourg and again found that the shows were 'owned' by major labels EMI, Decca, Pye and Philips. They were essentially 'payola' shows, and featured only music from the paying label. He said \"I have recorded the guy, so I can't get it played, so we have to start a radio station.\"\n\nHe therefore set about creating the pirate radio station Radio Caroline, which broadcast from a ship, the MV \"Caroline\" anchored in international waters off the coast of Essex, eastern England. In practice, the idea of Radio Caroline was based partly on a plan by Australian music publisher Allan Crawford (who had spent almost two years planning the launch of Radio Atlanta) and also on Radio Veronica which had been broadcasting off the Netherlands since 1960. Radio Caroline was largely funded by financier John Sheffield (great uncle of Samantha Cameron) and Carl Ross (creator of the Ross fishery frozen food business and grandfather of David Ross, the co-founder of Carphone Warehouse) and publisher Jocelyn Stevens.\n\nHe later became involved in the production of a number of films, including as executive producer on the Marianne Faithfull film, \"Girl on a Motorcycle\" and \"Two Virgins\" featuring John Lennon and Yoko Ono.\n\nO'Rahilly became manager of the Australian model-turned-actor George Lazenby, who played James Bond in one film. During production of the 1969 James Bond movie \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", O'Rahilly talked Lazenby into refusing a seven-movie Bond contract on grounds that the James Bond character was out of touch with the times, and would not successfully continue into the 1970s. Of this advice, Roger Moore said in his autobiography, \"My Word Is My Bond\", \"George took some bad advice ... I knew George then and have met him many times since. He admits he made a mistake\". O'Rahilly also appeared in Lazenby's film \"Universal Soldier\" where both men were credited as executive producers. \n\nIn the 1970s O'Rahilly, noticing that people \"found it easier to talk about hate than love\", developed the philosophy of \"Loving Awareness\", which has been heavily promoted on Caroline ever since. In 1976 an album of songs based on the concept was recorded by the Loving Awareness Band, a group assembled by O'Rahilly for the purpose.\n\nOn Monday 3 December 2007, O'Rahilly was inducted as a Fellow of the Radio Academy. O'Rahilly was inducted into the Hall Of Fame at the PPI Radio Awards, held at the Lyrath Hotel, Kilkenny, Ireland on 12 October 2012.\n\nIn September 2013, O'Rahilly was reported to be suffering from vascular dementia and to have returned to live in County Louth, Ireland, in sight of the port of Greenore where Radio Caroline was \"born\" 50 years ago.\n\n"}

The industrial revolution made his job redundant, therefore he tried to set up some building companies and became an architect. This provided him with sufficient funds to buy a house at Colston Bassett. Samuel and Sarah had a son named William, but he was not the William Booth who founded The Salvation Army.

Opened in 1885, it ran from Second and Spring Streets to First Street and Belmont Avenue. The completed railway was 6,940 feet long, just over a mile and a quarter, with a power house constructed in the middle, at Boylston Street. It was a single track system, with sidings where a down-hill car could coast past an up-hill car. The route included the steepest gradient on any street railway in North America, a 27.7 degree hill along Second Street between Bunker Hill Avenue and Hope Street on Bunker Hill. The line opened to Texas Street on Oct 8, 1885.\n\nThe railway was created to encourage sales of property west of downtown Los Angeles, property in the area known as Crown Hill. Henry Witmer, E.A. Hall, and Jesse Yarnell, owners of the property, organized the Los Angeles Improvement Company to subdivide the property into 1400 lots and build the cable railway to connect it to downtown. Other backers included downtown businessmen such as Isaac W. Lord and John Hollenbeck, who owned property near the terminus of the line at Second and Spring Streets.\n\nA beer garden resort, called City Park, was developed at the northeast corner of First and Lakeshore in order to draw more passengers to the line.\n\nIn January, 1888, James McLaughlin paid $130,000 for the line and the beer garden, something which turned out to be a most unfortunate decision. \n\nBy the spring of 1888 demand for lots had fallen off, but by then the Improvement Company had sold all but 52 of its lots. In addition, Hollenbeck had expanded his Hollenbeck Hotel at Second and Spring, Witmer and some associates had built the California Bank at the corner of Second and Fort Street (Broadway), and the city had built a new City Hall on Fort Street just south of Second Street.\n\nThe system was chronically plagued with damage to its cables and pulleys due to flooding. It had to be closed down for several days in the winter of 1888 because a replacement for a broken cable could not be delivered to the cable house through the muddy streets. \n\nIn March, 1889, an agreement was made with McLaughlin’s Cahuenga Valley Railroad (built in conjunction with Ivar Weid), which served the new Colegrove area, located just south of Hollywood. The cable railway would exchange transfers at First and Belmont so that its patrons could travel from downtown all the way to Colegrove.\n\nBut in late summer, 1889, the Cahuenga Valley Railroad was prevented from operating within the Los Angeles city limits. On October 13, McLaughlin suspended cable operations ”indefinitely”. He applied for a permit to extend the road to Alvarado, but the council denied the permit. On December 24 of that year another flood caused further damage to the line, and it was abandoned in 1890. With its demise, the Second Street Cable Railway had the distinction of being the first cable railway in the United States to go out of business.\n\n\n"}
