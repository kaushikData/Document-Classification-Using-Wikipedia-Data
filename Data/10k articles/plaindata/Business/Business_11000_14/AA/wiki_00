It is the southernmost of all Manhattan skyscrapers.\n\nThe building is 640 feet (195 m) tall with 50 floors. The building was designed by William Lescaze & Assocs. and Kahn & Jacobs. The building has 2.556 million square feet of office space. There is a retail concourse on the lower level.\n\nThe facade was designed by Nevio Maggiora, consisting of a boxlike \"beehive\" pattern with the windows recessed within, made of aluminum-clad wall elements resembling a type of thermally activated elevator button popular at the time of construction.\n\nNotable former occupants of One New York Plaza include Salomon Brothers in its heyday and Goldman Sachs, while current tenants are Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson Morgan Stanley, and Nature Publishing Group.\n\nIn 1959, the City of New York attempted to acquire the land under this development through eminent domain as part of the Battery Park Urban Renewal Area. The plan involved consolidating several blocks into a \"superblock\" for public housing. When that plan fell through, the city hoped to entice the New York Stock Exchange to relocate to the property. However, the owner of the property—the firm of Atlas McGrath—successfully sued to retain their land, claiming they were more than willing to develop the site privately.\n\nThe building was renovated in 1994, and repainted from a dark black and grey color scheme to a lighter white and light grey.\n\nThe building was used in the 2014 film The Other Woman.\n\nOn August 5, 1970, the building suffered a fire in which two people were killed and 35 injured. The deaths were caused after an occupied elevator was \"summoned\" to the burning floor when one of the thermally-activated call buttons—designed to react to a warm finger tapping it—reacted instead to the heat of the fire on that floor.\n\nOne New York Plaza's air-conditioning chiller depends on Con Ed's New York City steam system. On August 11, 2001, a steam turbine failed in the basement, and the damage from the resulting explosion disrupted Goldman's market-making NASDAQ activities for the day.\n\nIn October 2012, the building was heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy. An estimated 23 million gallons of water flooded the lower levels of the building. The retail concourse was submerged and needed to be completely gut-renovated. Office tenants were allowed to return starting November 17, 2012, and the retail concourse reopened in the winter of 2014.\n\n\n"}

More specifically, it may refer to public administration, the business of administering public policy as determined by government. However, outside France and Romania, this usage of the word is uncommon.\n\nFor the British sense of the word, most countries (be they English-speaking or not) use the term \"government\", referring to the \"administration\" of Winston Churchill as the \"Churchill government\". This is also true of the non-European members of the Commonwealth of Nations. An older, chiefly Commonwealth usage, is the term \"ministry\", as in \"Churchill Ministry\", which is still in official and academic use in Britain, Australia and Canada to refer the terms of prime ministers.\n\nDepending on the type of government, the word coalition may be used for a specific government. In the Netherlands, cabinet is the most-used term (as in \"the fourth Balkenende cabinet\"), although \"coalition\" or \"government\" are also used when one does not refer to a specific coalition (note that the two terms have slightly different meanings).\n\n"}

In order to do this, they must have knowledge of aspects of contract law, tax law, accounting, securities law, bankruptcy, intellectual property rights, licensing, zoning laws, and the laws specific to the business of the corporations that they work for. In recent years, controversies involving well known companies such as, Walmart and General Motors have highlighted the complex role of corporate lawyers in internal investigations, in which attorney-client privilege could be considered to shelter potential wrongdoing by the company. If a corporate lawyer's internal company clients are not assured of confidentiality, they will be less likely to seek legal advice, but keeping confidences can shelter society's access to vital information. \n\nThe practice of corporate law is less adversarial than that of trial law. Lawyers for both sides of a commercial transaction are less opponents than facilitators. One lawyer (quoted by Bernstein) characterizes them as \"the handmaidens of the deal\". Transactions take place amongst peers. There are rarely wronged parties, underdogs, or inequities in the financial means of the participants. Corporate lawyers structure those transactions, draft documents, review agreements, negotiate deals, and attend meetings.\n\nWhat areas of corporate law a corporate lawyer experiences depend from where the firm that he/she works for is, geographically, and how large it is. A small-town corporate lawyer in a small firm may deal in many short-term jobs such as drafting wills, divorce settlements, and real estate transactions, whereas a corporate lawyer in a large city firm may spend many months devoted to negotiating a single business transaction. Similarly, different firms may organize their subdivisions in different ways. Not all will include mergers and acquisitions under the umbrella of a corporate law division, for example.\n\nSome corporate lawyers become partners in their firms. Others become in-house counsel for corporations. Others still migrate into other professions such as investment banking and teaching law.\n\nSome publications read by those in the profession include \"Global Legal Studies\", \"Lawyers Weekly\", and the \"National Law Journal\".\n\nThe salary of a corporate lawyer can vary widely: those employed by major international law firms (\"BigLaw\" firms) earn starting salaries of US$180,000, which rise every year with experience (this amount excludes any additional bonus payments). Depending on the geographical location, the starting salary may be closer to US$160,000 if the market is secondary. Attorneys employed at smaller firms tend to earn smaller salaries.\n"}

An externalized cost is known to economists as a negative externality.\n\nFundamentally, cost externalization occurs when a company transfers some of its moral responsibilities as costs to the community directly or as degradation to the environment. For example, railroads and airlines transfer the cost of fuel, noise, and terminal infrastructure to the community. Airlines and auto manufacturers transfer the cost of degraded air quality to the community and the environment. By externalizing to the community or the environment, many true costs become lost in analysis because the true cost is non-quantifiable and neither the community nor the environment have effective advocates to recoup the damages. A major modern theme in the relationship of business to society is the society's ability (or inability) to resist this kind of externalization. In its extreme, society collapses as business realizes its profits.\n\nCost externalizing is one of the steps a company may take to \"shape up\" or reduce overhead by down sizing a cost center or an unprofitable department.\n\nAn example of cost externalizing would be using a global courier service (such as FedEx and UPS) to do all or most of the shipping and logistics work for the company. For a business to take on the responsibilities of worldwide shipping by itself would be too costly. It would be far more sensible to let a third party who specialize in shipping to take care of the task and pay them for it.\n\nCost externalizing in no way should be considered a quick fix. Simply forcing suppliers and service providers to take on more responsibilities and cost is not a healthy externalization of cost. Careful operational forecasting must take place before taking steps towards cost externalization. Otherwise, there is no way to ascertain if cost externalizing would actually lower the operational cost of the company.\n\nTo externalize cost, budgeting must also take place. Because the company will be paying out to a third party, the cost would be more clear than when the process took place in-house. This would in turn give a chance for the suppliers and service providers to compete for business and may further reduce cost. Yet in some cases, the reduction in cost may lead to reduction in quality. Because quality is not quantified easily, it may be difficult to measure and compare - especially if the quality for all parties begin to fall, business managers may fail to notice the change in quality. This is one kind of control that a business loses when externalizing cost.\n\nAnother option is for a company to transfer some of its costs to its customers. For example, reducing staff in a customer service department that handles incoming phone calls will usually increase hold times for customers seeking support. The company reduces its costs by reducing staff, while the customer bears the increased cost of waiting on hold. Thus an expense has been transferred from the company to the customer. This can reduce customer satisfaction, to the point that some customers will be motivated to switch to another company. However if the company can gain a legal monopoly (through, for example, intellectual property laws) the customer has no choice of a competitor available. The customer's only option then is to take it or leave it.\n\nCustomers can also absorb some of a company's costs by performing tasks that the company formerly provided. An early example of this was the self-service gas station, followed more recently by self checkout kiosks in grocery stores. This can have less of a negative customer satisfaction impact because some customers actually prefer to help themselves.\n\nAs in any business operation, costs externalization has its pros and cons. It is up to the business managers to make the decisions and take advantage of cost externalization.\n\n\n"}

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979.\n\nWomen's organizations became increasingly influential in the years after the American Civil War as a class of highly educated, middle class women arose in the nation. Their impact was at its peak in the years around World War I, when the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women's suffrage, was ratified. In Detroit, it became apparent at that time that the many women's organizations in the city needed a centralized place to meet. In 1919, a number of local activists founded the \"Women's City Club\" to \"promote a broad acquaintance among women.\" The club hired architect William B. Stratton (husband of ceramicist and club member Mary Chase Perry Stratton) to design a suitable building; the structure was completed in 1924.\n\nThe exterior of the building is built of brick, in a featureless modern style. The six stories are differentiated into the lower three floors, which are blocky and regular; and the three upper floors, which appear to be set onto the lower floors. The brick color differs between the two sections, as does the appearance of the windows. There is also a horizontal range of bricks between the two sections. The lower floors were designed to be meeting spaces for social events and planning the activities of members. The three upper floors were used as an apartments for women who moved to Detroit for employment and wished to live in a wholesome environment.\n\nThe interior decor was strongly influenced by the then-current Arts and Crafts movement, with hand-wrought ironwork and Pewabic Pottery tilework. The swimming pool was also decorated with Pewabic tile.\n\nThe City Club offered a number of classes and recreation programs for women, eventually enrolling over 8,000 members. However, membership declined after World War II, and in 1974 the club moved to smaller quarters. The social space was used for various purposes, including a restaurant and bar in later years. The building is currently owned by Forbes Management (also owners of the Elwood Bar, Gem Theater, and The Fillmore Detroit), and has recently received an upgrade of its façade.\n"}

He married Molly Elizabeth Stark, daughter of John Sherwood Stark and Sharon Ellen Wing, on August 22, 1998, in Nantucket, Massachusetts.\n\nThey have five children: Riley Maria Kennedy, born Aug 1999 in Nantucket, Massachusetts; Mary Julia Kennedy, born Aug 2001; Rowen Frances Kennedy, born Feb 2004; George Skakel Kennedy, born April 2007 and Anthony Boru Kennedy, born Jan 2012.\n\nKennedy graduated from Georgetown Preparatory School and Brown University and began his career as a print journalist with \"The Nantucket Beacon\" and later \"The New York Post\". As an investigative reporter for the Post, Kennedy obtained the first interview with the officer who arrested Oklahoma City bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh and broke numerous other health care and metropolitan area stories.\n\nHe joined Fox News Channel as a general assignment reporter in August 1996 and hosts a bi-weekly program on the network, \"Douglas Kennedy’s American Stories\".

He said that in Irwin's case, it would be really \"unnecessary and in very poor taste.\"\n\nOn November 20, 2012, Kennedy was acquitted of misdemeanor physical harassment and child endangerment charges in connection with a January 7, 2012 altercation with two nurses at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York, two days after his son, Daniel Boru, was born there. Kennedy attempted to take his infant off the maternity ward for some fresh air, which two nurses said was against hospital policy, and who claimed that he physically assaulted them when they tried to stop him from doing so. Kennedy was separately investigated by New York child welfare authorities following the incident, but social workers found no signs of child abuse in his home and declared the allegations unfounded in March 2012.\n\n"}

Beginning October 10, 2007, it was broadcast every weeknight at 5pm ET, one hour after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, until mid-2011 when it was moved to just four nights per week, Monday through Thursday, to make room for special option and currency trading shows on Friday evenings. On March 22, 2013, it returned to the Friday night slot as a half-hour show, followed by the \"Options Action\" half-hour show. The show originates from the NASDAQ MarketSite in New York City.\n\nMelissa Lee anchors a fast-paced discussion among four professional Wall Street traders. The group discusses various investment strategies, including technical analysis, and debate the merits of each other's arguments for or against a particular stock or sector. The show covers topics such as options trading, commodities, and exchange-traded funds.\n\nMost episodes feature regularly appearing traders: Pete Najarian, Guy Adami, Karen Finerman, Tim Seymour, and Joe Terranova.\n\nThe success of \"Mad Money\" prompted CNBC to look to replicate that success with another show. \"Fast Money\" was created by Dylan Ratigan and Susan Krakower, Vice President of Strategic Programming and Development, as a spin off from a weekly segment that first aired in the May 2006 episodes of \"On the Money\". The show originally aired from CNBC headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, with Ratigan as host, and a regular panel of Jeff Macke, Guy Adami, Tim Strazzini, and Eric Bolling. By January 8, 2007, it became a weekday show with its studio at the NASDAQ MarketSite.\n\nOn Fridays, beginning with March 5, 2010, the show was truncated to just 30 minutes as \"Options Action\" (also hosted by Melissa Lee) was aired in the 5:30 ET timeslot. Both \"Fast Money\" and \"Options Action\" are broadcast from the NASDAQ MarketSite.\n\nIn mid-2011, \"Fast Money\" was removed from the Friday night line-up altogether to make room for \"Money in Motion: Currency Trading\" (also hosted by Melissa Lee) which airs in the 5:30 ET time slot, while \"Options Action\" was moved up a half-hour to 5pm ET. On March 22, 2013, it returned to the Friday night lineup. The program airs the first half hour (5pm ET) followed by half hour of \"Options Action\" at 5:30pm ET. \"Money in Motion\" was removed from the CNBC lineup\n\nOn October 13, 2014, \"Fast Money\", along with CNBC's other business-day programs, were launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of a network-wide switch to a full 16:9 presentation.\n\nStrazzini was replaced by Najarian on May 18, 2007. Bolling was replaced by Finerman on September 4, 2007. Seymour, who had appeared on the show as a substitute panelist, was made a regular in October 2008. After published rumors of conflict with \"Fast Money\" co-creator Susan Krakower, Ratigan left the network on March 27, 2009 when his CNBC contract expired.

Ratings were relatively low, with the program averaging a bit over 110,000 viewers per week. During the week of 2006-09-18, the program tried a new timeslot at 5pm ET, the plush timeslot with highly rated \"Closing Bell\" serving as the lead-out (bumping \"Kudlow & Company\" to 8pm for the week). Here the show flourished, nearly doubling its viewership average to 211,000 viewers (on-par with what K&C normally gets). The 5pm ET timeslot, while successful, bumped \"Kudlow & Company\" to 8pm. This brought the show's ratings down substantially compared to where they were before the temporary move. After its successful 5pm test run during the week of 2006-09-18, CNBC retried the program again at 8pm the week after. CNBC had hoped it may have gained some traction after the increased viewership from the week prior. The show did not. Ratings were roughly on-par with the summer 2006 airings.\n\n\"Fast Money\" is recorded at the Times Square New York, New York, street-level studios of the NASDAQ by CNBC, a national cable television network owned by NBC Universal/Comcast.\n\nThe show is recorded weekdays for air at 5 p.m. (ET). As the show is being ingested digitally in the Thomson Grass Valley MAN, the show is assembled by the editor and producer to be made into the first-run air product viewers watch Monday through Thursday at 5 p.m. (ET).\n\nAs of January 2009, among the many contributors are producer Jason Farkas, and tape producers Heather Wilcox and Boaz Halaban, responsible for creating and delivering the final show to air, after creating special Avid Adrenaline edited elements by CNBC Staff Avid Editors such as Conrad deVroeg, Gary Princz, Diana Constantino, and Dave Lettieri, and constructing the show with CNBC Staff Grass Valley NewsEdit Editors Rich Uliasz, Cosimo Camporeale, Carolyn Shivey, Vanessa DiPietro, Keri Conjura, Diana Acosta, and Kelly Frisco.\n\nOn 2007-02-27, a special edition of \"Fast Money\", which covered that day's 416-point plunge on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, aired. It was rebroadcast at 1am ET, pre-empting that night's scheduled airing of \"The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch\".\n\nOn 2007-03-02, another special edition of \"Fast Money\" aired. This time, it was a look back at Wall Street's worst week in nearly 4½ years. Erin Burnett was the guest moderator of that episode (Dylan Ratigan was on assignment in Washington, DC when it aired).\n\nOn 2007-10-19, \"Fast Money\" was broadcast live from the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA. This special edition also covered that day's 367-point plunge on the Dow, which coincidentally, occurred 20 years to the day it lost 508 points, or 22.6% of its value on Black Monday.\n\nThe \"Fast Money 1st Anniversary\" special was broadcast on 2008-01-15. This special edition showed memorable clips from its first year on the air from the NASDAQ (where \"Fast Money\" re-debuted on 2007-01-08), and also covered that day's 277-point plunge on the Dow. Michael Eisner, former Disney CEO and current host of his own CNBC show, \"Conversations with Michael Eisner\", made a special guest appearance on this program.\n\nOn 2008-02-29, \"Fast Money\" was broadcast live from Coral Gables, FL (a suburb of Miami). This special edition also covered that day's 315-point plunge on the Dow. Jack Welch, former Chairman and CEO of General Electric (the parent company of CNBC) and retiring NBA star Alonzo Mourning made special guest appearances on this program, which was also the first \"Fast Money\" to be filmed outdoors.\n\nThe third \"Fast Money\" road show was broadcast live from the Cadillac Palace Theatre in Chicago on 2008-05-16. Making special guest appearances in this edition were CME Chairman Terry Duffy, personal finance guru Suze Orman (host of CNBC's \"The Suze Orman Show\") and Playboy Enterprises CEO Christie Hefner.\n\nThese special half-hour editions of \"Fast Money\" were aired at 1pm ET during the 2008 Summer Olympics over two weeks, from 2008-08-11 to 2008-08-22. Due to CNBC's Olympics coverage, \"Fast Money Now\" (1pm ET) and \"Mad Money at the Half\" (1:30pm ET) were shown in place of the second hour of \"Power Lunch\", while the hour-long editions of \"Fast Money\" (seen on a same-day tape delay) aired at 9pm ET.\n\nThis special edition of \"Fast Money\", which was broadcast from New York 2008-09-19 in front of a live audience, featured a guest appearance from activist investor Carl Icahn. This show was filmed in the Jazz at Lincoln Center—Allen Room. This show also covered that day's 369-point gain on the Dow.\n\nThis edition of the \"Fast Money\" road show was broadcast live from the DAR Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. on 2008-11-07. Guests included Keith Hennessey, assistant to the President for economic policy and Richard Brown, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chief economist. The panel included five members with Tim Seymour joining the regular crew.\n\nFor the week of 2017-01-09, the tenth-anniversary editions of \"Fast Money\" were broadcast live from the NASDAQ MarketSite in New York.\n\nStudents from the top business schools across America competed in the \"Fast Money MBA Challenge\", which was also hosted by Dylan Ratigan. The shows were recorded at CNBC Global Headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, NJ on 2007-07-14 and 2007-07-15. \"Fast Money MBA Challenge\" aired on 2007-08-01, 2007-08-08, 2007-08-15, and 2007-08-22, and were repeated on the following Sunday at 9PM and 12AM Eastern Time from 2007-08-05 through 2007-08-26.\n\nParticipating schools:\n\nThe championship final of the \"Fast Money MBA Challenge\" was broadcast live from outside the NASDAQ Marketsite in New York City on 2007-08-22. In that championship final, Yale faced Texas for the $200,000 prize. After six weeks, the $200,000 prize was won by Yale.\n\nCNBC Asia broadcasts the programme on Tuesdays to Saturdays 5AM SIN/HK/TWN Time LIVE during the Daylight Saving Time period in the U.S. Without DST, CNBC Asia only broadcasts \"LIVE\" Friday (US time) edition of \"Fast Money\" on Saturdays morning at 6am SIN/HK/TWN time, and rerun version of Mondays to Thursdays US time editions are aired from Tuesdays to Fridays at 12pm SIN/HK/TWN time.\n\nCNBC Europe does not generally broadcast the programme live apart from on special occasions when the news of the day merits extra live news programming. The channel instead airs broadcasts of CNBC documentaries and weekly magazine programmes in the timeslot. \n\nIn recent years \"Fast Money\" was shown on CNBC Europe on a delayed basis between October and March. However this year (November 2016 to March 2017) CNBC Europe has not shown the programme, instead broadcasting Nightly Business Report and a repeat of a weekly magazine show or a one-off report.\n\n\"Fast Money Halftime Report\" is an American financial stock trading talk show that airs from noon-1 ET on CNBC. This show, which follows the same format as the 5pm show, debuted July 7, 2010. It spun off from a segment on \"Power Lunch\", which itself moved to 1 ET from noon ET on July 7, 2010. Unlike \"Fast Money\", this halftime market show is hosted by Scott Wapner, and is broadcast live from CNBC Global Headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, NJ.\n\nOriginally aired as a half-hour show, the \"Fast Money Halftime Report\" doubled its runtime from 30 minutes to 60 minutes on October 17, 2011 and also moved up to the noon ET timeslot. The newly expanded hour-long show replaced \"The Strategy Session\", which was cancelled October 14, 2011 as a result of very low ratings.\n\n"}

He married the former Martina Monasterio in 1833, and they had seven children. He inherited his father's commercial establishment in 1838 and became one of Buenos Aires' leading businesspeople.\n\nFollowing the September 11, 1852, declaration of the secessionist State of Buenos Aires, Llavallol held numerous posts in the new government. He was elected to the Lower House of Congress, becoming President of the Chamber, and to the Senate in 1854, serving as its president until 1856. He was appointed Economy Minister and took part in the establishment of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange in 1854, and served as its first president until August 1855. Named President of the newly established Buenos Aires Western Railway, he presided over the August 30, 1857, inaugural of its first line, designed by British engineer William Bragge.\n\nElected Vice-Governor in Valentín Alsina's ticket in December 1858, the defeat of Buenos Aires forces by those of the Argentine Confederation at the Battle of Cepeda (1859) led to Confederate President Justo José de Urquiza's demand that Alsina resign, and the more pragmatic Llavallol succeeded Alsina as governor on October 23, 1859.\n\nGovernor Llavallol's brief tenure as governor was highlighted by the resulting negotiations, which produced the Pact of San José de Flores and significant concessions toward Buenos Aires.

{"id": "1438807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1438807", "title": "Ferdinand Piëch", "text": "Ferdinand Piëch\n\nFerdinand Karl Piëch (born 17 April 1937) is an Austrian business magnate, engineer and executive who was the chairman of the executive board (\"Vorstandsvorsitzender\") of Volkswagen Group in 1993-2002 and the chairman of the supervisory board (\"Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender\") of Volkswagen Group in 2002-2015.\n\nA grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, Piëch started his career at Porsche, before leaving for Audi after an agreement that no member of the Porsche or Piëch families should be involved in the day-to-day operations of the company. Piëch eventually became the head of Audi, where he is credited with evolving and growing Audi into a competitor to equal Mercedes-Benz and BMW, thanks in part to innovative designs such as the Quattro and 100. In 1993, Piëch became the chairman and CEO of Volkswagen Group, which he is credited with turning into the large conglomerate it is today; He oversaw the purchase of Lamborghini and Bentley, as well as \nthe founding of Bugatti Automobiles, all of which he integrated with the Volkswagen, Škoda, SEAT and Audi brands into a ladder-type structure similar to that used by Alfred Sloan at General Motors. Piëch was required to retire at age 65 per Volkswagen company policy, but he remained on its supervisory board and was involved in the company's strategic decisions until his resignation on 25 April 2015.\n\nEducated as an engineer, Piëch influenced the development of numerous significant cars including the Audi Quattro and notably, the Bugatti Veyron, which as of 2012 was the fastest, most powerful and most expensive road legal automobile ever built. Due to his influence on the automobile industry, Piëch was named the Car Executive of the Century in 1999.\n\nPiëch was born in Vienna, Austria, to Louise (\"née\" Porsche; Ferdinand's daughter) and Anton Piëch, a lawyer. He studied at the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz and graduated from the ETH Zurich, Switzerland, in 1962, with a degree in mechanical engineering, having written a master thesis about the development of a Formula One (F1) engine. At the same time, Porsche was involved in F1 and developed an 8-cylinder engine for the Porsche 804.\n\nFrom 1963 to 1971, he worked at Porsche in Stuttgart, on the development of the Porsche 906 and following models that led to the successful Porsche 917. In 1972, he moved to Audi in Ingolstadt. Starting from 1975, he was manager of technological engineering, being responsible for the concepts of the Audi 80 and Audi 100. He celebrated his 40th birthday on 17 April 1977 with a ball at which guests included Giorgetto Giugiaro and at which the staff of the Porsche Hotel presented him with an Audi 80 that was just long and constructed of marzipan. In 1977 he also initiated the development of a car for the World Rally Championship, resulting in the four-wheel drive Audi Quattro. The engine used in the Quattro model was a turbocharged inline-5 cylinder unit.\n\nPiëch held a small engineering company in the time between leaving Porsche AG and joining Audi, and while there, he developed a 5 cylinder in-line diesel engine for Mercedes-Benz. He picked up the concept again after moving to Audi, because there was a market demand for engines with more than 4 cylinders. At the time, Audi (and the Audi-derived VW Passat/Santana model range) used longitudinally mounted inline engines and front wheel drive. More conservative layouts with 6 cylinders were rejected because of engineering and production costs (V6 engine) or packaging requirements (straight 6 did not fit because front wheel drive required that it be mounted in front of the axis).\n\nIn 1993, Piëch moved to Volkswagen AG, parent company of the Volkswagen Group, where he became Chairman of the Board of Management, succeeding Carl Hahn. At that time Volkswagen was only three months from bankruptcy, and he was central to orchestrating its dramatic turnaround. He retired from the Board of Management in 2002, but still serves in an advisory capacity as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.\nIn 2000, he was named chairman of Scania AB. He retired from the management board in 2002 and was succeeded as chairman by Bernd Pischetsrieder.\n\nWhile head of Volkswagen Group, Piëch was known for his aggressive moves into other markets. He drove the Volkswagen and Audi brands upmarket with great success. Piëch also pursued other marques, successfully acquiring Lamborghini for Audi, and establishing Bugatti Automobiles SAS. His purchase of British Rolls-Royce and Bentley was more controversial. After successfully buying the Crewe, England, carbuilding operation, VW was denied the use of the Rolls-Royce brand name. Piëch later claimed that he only really wanted the Bentley brand, but at the time the loss of Rolls to rival BMW was widely seen as a major failure.\n\nWhat was not a failure, however, was his effort to revitalize Volkswagen in North America. Hahn's previous efforts to regain market share in the United States and Canada—which he had built up as the head of Volkswagen of America from 1958 to 1965—were unsuccessful, but Piëch helped reverse VW's fortunes by the decision to manufacture the Volkswagen New Beetle, the introduction of which in 1998 gave Volkswagen of America a much needed impulse.\n\nDue to his continued influence in the auto industry, Automobile Magazine announced that Piëch has won their Man of the Year award for 2011.\n\nAt Porsche, Piëch triggered significant changes in the company's policy. For example, the position of drivers in race cars was moved from the left to the right, as this gives advantages on the predominantly clockwise race tracks. After making mainly small 2000 cc race cars that were supposed to be closely related to road cars, Porsche made a risky investment by unexpectedly building twenty-five 5000 cc Porsche 917, surprising the rule makers at the FIA. Even Ferrari had needed to sell his company to Fiat before making such a move. Always thinking big, Piëch started development of a 16-cylinder engine for the Can-Am series. It is probably no coincidence that his grandfather had developed a famous supercharged 16-cylinder engine for the Auto Union racing cars in the 1930s. Piëch was denied the chance to complete it, as a turbocharged version of the existing 12-cylinder was simpler, more powerful and very successful. Three decades later as CEO of Volkswagen Group, Piëch insisted on the very ambitious Bugatti Veyron, with a turbocharged W16-cylinder, and top speed. Some of these figures are still not higher than those of the Porsche 917/30, but higher than most current racing cars. Piëch was also behind the Volkswagen Phaeton luxury saloon, which was intended as a rival to other German luxury cars, but the sales of the model have been disappointing.\n\nPiëch owns a significant share of Porsche, exactly 10%. In order to prevent discussions among the many family members, a policy was established in early 1972 that no Porsche family member is allowed to be involved in the management of the company. Even company founder Ferry Porsche, Piëch's uncle, only held a seat on the supervisory board of Porsche after the company's legal form was changed from a limited partnership to a private legal company. This made Piëch move to Audi after the foundation of his engineering bureau.\n\nPiëch has fathered 12 children with four different women, and is currently married to Ursula (Uschi) Piëch. He is dyslexic, an atheist, and has a vast car collection that includes two Bugatti Veyrons that are regularly driven by him and his wife. An aggressive and demanding manager, Piëch's prolific firing of subordinates throughout his career has been legendary in automotive circles, particularly how he engineered the ousting of former Volkswagen CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder and Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking. According to Piëch, he fires any subordinate who \"makes the same mistake twice\". However, his efforts to similarly oust chief executive Martin Winterkorn backfired and led to the resignations of Piëch and his wife from the supervisory board.\n\n\n"}

He is the 10th-generation owner of Riedel (glass manufacturer) established in 1756 and best known for its production of grape variety-specific glassware designed to enhance types of wines based on specific properties of individual grape varieties. Georg Riedel joined the family business in 1973 serving as accountant, before rising to co-CEO of Riedel Crystal alongside his father, Professor Claus Josef Riedel, from 1987 until 1994. He served as Chief Executive Officer from 1994 until 2013. Georg Riedel succeeded his father, who first developed the concept of wine-enhancing glassware in 1958, and is best known for bringing variety-specific wine glasses to a global audience.\n\nGeorg Josef Riedel was born in 1949 in Innsbruck, Austria to Claus J Riedel and Adia Rosa Riedel (née Parodi).\n\nIn 1973, Georg Riedel joined his family’s company as an accountant. In 1982, he expanded Riedel’s product-development process, founding the Glass Workshop based at the company headquarters in Kufstein, Austria, with an increased focus on the development of new glassware shapes to enhance the flavors of alcoholic beverages on the palate Riedel History & Generations. In 1987 Riedel was named co-CEO of the company alongside his father Claus. In this role, Georg Riedel worked directly with industry experts and leading winemakers, including Robert Mondavi and Angelo Gaja, inviting them to taste their wines in Riedel glasses of different shapes and sizes to determine the glass that best expressed the flavors and aromas of their single variety wines. As a result, Riedel Crystal earned the endorsement of industry experts and influential winemakers, who insisted that their wines be served exclusively in Riedel glasses. To that end, in 1991, Robert M. Parker, Jr. who described Riedel glassware in The Wine Advocate, claimed: “The finest glasses for both technical and hedonistic purposes are those made by Riedel. The effect of these glasses on fine wine is profound.”\n\nIn 1994 Georg Riedel took over as sole Chief Executive Officer of Riedel Crystal. In 2013, Riedel stepped down as CEO and named his son, 11th-generation Maximilian Riedel, President and CEO of Riedel Crystal and its worldwide subsidiaries. Today, Riedel is managed jointly by Georg Riedel and Maximilian Riedel. The two travel the world to educate over 20,000 people annually on variety specific stemware.\n\nIn 1979 Georg Riedel established Riedel Crystal of America in New York. He continued the company’s expansion, opening Riedel offices in Canada (1992), Germany (1996), Japan (2000), the UK (2001), Australia (2007), and China and Japan (2011).\n\nIn 2004, Georg Riedel bought the German-based F.X. Nachtmann, which included both the Nachtmann decorative and wine glassware brand and the Spiegelau beer and wine glassware brand. The three brands (Riedel, Nachtmann, Spiegelau) operate under “Riedel Glass Works” as one of the largest producers of fine glass in Europe.\n\n\n\nAn avid runner, Riedel began running at age 30 and has completed 10 marathons and undertakes mountain hiking expeditions. Riedel has been married for 41 years to his wife, Eva. They met during his time as a student in Vienna and wed in 1973. They have two children, son Maximilian J Riedel and daughter Laetizia Riedel-Rothlisberger, and two grandsons.\n"}

He was a leading member of the Conservative Monday Club.\n\nWard was born in Southern Rhodesia to an English father and a South African mother. His parents settled in Africa and were engaged in enterprises such as the financing of railway construction and the building of numerous hotels. They managed the Victoria Falls Hotel until 1937. He chose a career in journalism starting with the Cape Argus and then becoming a specialist in African journalism covering the great social upheavals of the late 1950s and 60's for Reuters. He then settled in Salisbury and became Head of News Services at the Rhodesia Herald, eventually becoming Director-General of the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation which, in effect, put him in charge of government propaganda. Ward is said to have removed references to black sporting achievements from sports programmes carried on state television.\n\nFollowing an armed insurrection, several years of negotiations, and finally the imposition of sanctions by South Africa at the behest of The West, the Smith administration was replaced by African majority rule in 1979. Ward described this as \"the betrayal of western nations to their own kind.\" As a prominent supporter of the Smith administration, Ward was forced to leave Zimbabwe. He and his family moved to South Africa and advised the white minority government there on avoiding international economic sanctions.\n\nSubsequently, Ward served as a political adviser to many African leaders and was involved in international intelligence. His watch-word became \"dedicated to fighting communism\" and he traveled worldwide, lecturing on counter-insurgency and terrorism. He described the Soviet Union as run by \"gangsters\" and totally untrustworthy.\n\nHe supported the anti-communist revolts in the former Soviet Bloc saying that it was \"a simple matter of good versus evil.\" In Africa, Ward saw no hope. \"Africa is the most exploited of all the continents, and it will stay that way. There has never been any peace in Africa, and I see no end to tribal conflict, spreading of diseases and other plagues,\" he said.\n\nWard was an overseas member of the Conservative Monday Club and found himself the center of a minor sensation on July 26, 1977 when immigration officials at Heathrow Airport held him for seven hours, before formally refusing him permission to enter Britain and placing him aboard another plane to Munich. He was due to address a meeting of the Africa Committee of the Monday Club at the House of Lords, organized by the former Conservative Party MP Harold Soref on the 29th, and visit family in Gloucestershire. On being asked why entry had never been refused on previous journeys to Britain by Ward, a Home Office spokesman said \"I don't know. It may have been a mistake or oversight.\" Formal protests were made to the Home Office by Tory Members of Parliament (MPs) John Biggs-Davison, Sir Patrick Wall, and Teddy Taylor.\n\nIn 1982 he wrote an article entitled \"Zimbabwe Today\" for the Monday Club's journal, \"Monday World\", prophetic in its content. His wife died in 1986 and he moved to Great Britain. Three of his four children remained in South Africa.\n\nAt the October 1988 Conservative Party Conference, Western Goals (UK) (which Ward had also joined) held a fringe meeting on the subject of \"International Terrorism - how the West can fight back\". Harvey Ward, Sir Alfred Sherman, Rev Martin Smyth, MP, and Andrew Hunter, MP, were the speakers. The latter spoke concerning top-level links between the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and African National Congress (ANC).\n\nIn 1989 Ward was working for James Gibb Stuart at Ossian Books Ltd. in Glasgow. He continued to travel and lecture, and joined the Conservative Party. \n\nHe became an active member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Conservative Monday Club, and by 1990 was a member of the Club's Executive Council.\n\nIn 1991 Ward is claimed to have worked in conjunction with South African security policeman Paul Erasmus to secretly leak false accusations against Winnie Mandela and her daughters, accusing them of being nymphomaniacs and drug abusers. The reports were described as having come from dissidents in the African National Congress, and were issued in an effort to divide the ANC's leadership. They were subsequently taken up by papers such as \"The Independent\", the \"Sunday Times\" and \"Vanity Fair\". Erasmus later acknowledged profound regret for his actions in this and other matters, and affected a reconciliation with Mandela. He claimed Ward's role in the propaganda campaign during the late 1990s, but only after Ward had died.\n\nIn the early 1990s Ward's fourth child Rowena, who had been in the British Police Service returned to live in South Africa and Ward followed, taking up residence in Port Elizabeth with his son, Harvey and his daughter in law Kathy. His last public engagement was speaking at the Robbie Burns Society in Port Elizabeth in March 1995. One month later had a heart attack during a game of bowls, and died.\n\n\n"}

A member of the prominent Lodge family, he received his PhD in history from Harvard University. He is best known for his positions on foreign policy, especially his battle with President Woodrow Wilson in 1919 over the Treaty of Versailles. The failure of that treaty ensured that the United States never joined the League of Nations.\n\nBorn in Beverly, Massachusetts, Lodge won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives after graduating from Harvard. He and his close friend, Theodore Roosevelt, opposed James G. Blaine's nomination at the 1884 Republican National Convention, but supported Blaine in the general election against Grover Cleveland. Lodge was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1886 before joining the United States Senate in 1893.\n\nIn the Senate, he sponsored the unsuccessful Lodge Bill, which sought to protect the voting rights of African Americans. He supported the Spanish–American War and called for the annexation of the Philippines after the war. He also supported immigration restrictions, becoming a member of the Immigration Restriction League and influencing the Immigration Act of 1917. Lodge served as Chairman of the 1900 and 1908 Republican National Conventions. A member of the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Lodge opposed Roosevelt's third party bid for president in 1912, but the two remained close friends.\n\nDuring the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, Lodge advocated entrance into World War I on the side of the Entente Powers. He became Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, emerging as the leader of the Senate Republicans. He led the opposition to Wilson's Treaty of Versailles, proposing twelve reservations to the treaty. He most strongly objected to the provision of the treaty that required all nations to repel aggression, fearing that this would erode Congressional powers and commit the U.S. to burdensome obligations. Lodge prevailed in the treaty battle and Lodge's objections would influence the United Nations, the successor to the League of Nations. After the war, Lodge participated in the creation of the Washington Naval Treaty, which sought to prevent a naval arms race. He remained in the Senate until his death in 1924.\n\nLodge was born in Beverly, Massachusetts. His father was John Ellerton Lodge. His mother was Anna Cabot, through whom he was a great-grandson of George Cabot. Lodge grew up on Boston's Beacon Hill and spent part of his childhood in Nahant, Massachusetts where he witnessed the 1860 kidnapping of a classmate and gave testimony leading to the arrest and conviction of the kidnappers. He was cousin to the American polymath Charles Peirce.\n\nIn 1872, he graduated from Harvard College, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon, the Porcellian Club, and the Hasty Pudding Club. In 1874, he graduated from Harvard Law School, and was admitted to the bar in 1875, practicing at the Boston firm now known as Ropes & Gray.\n\nAfter traveling through Europe, Lodge returned to Harvard, and in 1876, became one of the first recipients of a Ph.D. in history and government from Harvard. His dissertation dealt with the Germanic origins of Anglo-Saxon land law. His teacher and mentor during his graduate studies was Henry Adams; Lodge maintained a lifelong friendship with Adams.\n\nLodge was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1878. In 1881, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.\n\nIn 1880–1882, Lodge served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Lodge represented his home state in the United States House of Representatives from 1887 to 1893 and in the Senate from 1893 to 1924.\n\nAlong with his close friend Theodore Roosevelt, Lodge was sympathetic to the concerns of the Mugwump faction of the Republican Party. Nonetheless, both reluctantly supported James Blaine and protectionism in the 1884 election. Blaine lost narrowly. Lodge was a staunch supporter of the gold standard, vehemently opposing the Populists and the silverites, who were led by the populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan in 1896.\n\nLodge was easily reelected time and again but his greatest challenge came in his reelection bid in January 1911. The Democrats had made significant gains in Massachusetts and the Republicans were split between the progressive and conservative wings, with Lodge trying to mollify both sides. In a major speech before the legislature voted, Lodge took pride in his long selfless service to the state. He emphasized that he had never engaged in corruption or self-dealing. He rarely campaigned on his own behalf but now he made his case, explaining his important roles in civil service reform, maintaining the gold standard, expanding the Navy, developing policies for the Philippine Islands, and trying to restrict immigration by illiterate Europeans, as well as his support for some progressive reforms. Most of all he appealed to party loyalty. Lodge was reelected by five votes.\n\nLodge was very close to Theodore Roosevelt for both of their entire careers. However, Lodge was too conservative to accept Roosevelt's attacks on the judiciary in 1910, and his call for the initiative, referendum, and recall. Lodge stood silent when Roosevelt broke with the party and ran as a third-party candidate in 1912. Lodge voted for Taft instead of Roosevelt; after Woodrow Wilson won the election the Lodge-Roosevelt friendship resumed.\n\nIn 1890, Lodge co-authored the Federal Elections Bill, along with Sen. George Frisbie Hoar, that guaranteed federal protection for African American voting rights. Although the proposed legislation was supported by President Benjamin Harrison, the bill was blocked by filibustering Democrats in the Senate.\n\nIn 1891, he became a member of the Massachusetts Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was assigned national membership number 4,901.\n\nThat same year, following the lynching of eleven Italian Americans in New Orleans, Lodge published an article blaming the victims and proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration.\n\nLodge was a strong backer of U.S. intervention in Cuba in 1898, arguing that it was the moral responsibility of the United States to do so:\n\nOf the sympathies of the American people, generous, liberty-loving, I have no question. They are with the Cubans in their struggle for freedom. I believe our people would welcome any action on the part of the United States to put an end to the terrible state of things existing there. We can stop it. We can stop it peacefully. We can stop it, in my judgment, by pursuing a proper diplomacy and offering our good offices. Let it once be understood that we mean to stop the horrible state of things in Cuba and it will be stopped. The great power of the United States, if it is once invoked and uplifted, is capable of greater things than that.\n\nFollowing American victory in the Spanish–American War, Lodge came to represent the imperialist faction of the Senate, those who called for the annexation of the Philippines. Lodge maintained that the United States needed to have a strong navy and be more involved in foreign affairs.\n\nLodge was a vocal proponent of immigration restrictions, for a number of reasons. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, large numbers of immigrants, primarily from Eastern and Southern Europe, were flooding into industrial centers. Lodge feared that unskilled foreign labor was undermining the standard of living for American workers, and that a mass influx of uneducated immigrants would result in social conflict and national decline.\n\nHis position was also influenced by his beliefs about race. In a May 1891 article on Italian immigration, Lodge expressed his concern that immigration by \"the races who have peopled the United States\" was declining, while \"the immigration of people removed from us in race and blood\" was on the rise. He considered northern Italians superior to southern Italians, not only because they tended to be better educated, but because they were more \"Teutonic\" than their southern counterparts, whose immigration he sought to restrict.\n\nLodge was a supporter of \"100% Americanism,\" a common theme in the nativist movement of the era. In an address to the New England Society of Brooklyn in 1888, Lodge stated:\n\nLet every man honor and love the land of his birth and the race from which he springs and keep their memory green. It is a pious and honorable duty. But let us have done with British-Americans and Irish-Americans and German-Americans, and so on, and all be Americans ... If a man is going to be an American at all let him be so without any qualifying adjectives; and if he is going to be something else, let him drop the word American from his personal description.\n\nHe did not believe, however, that all races were equally capable or worthy of being assimilated. In \"The Great Peril of Unrestricted Immigration\" he wrote that \"you can take a Hindoo and give him the highest education the world can afford ... but you cannot make him an Englishman\", and cautioned against the mixing of \"higher\" and \"lower\" races:\n\nOn the moral qualities of the English-speaking race, therefore, rest our history, our victories, and all our future. There is only one way in which you can lower those qualities or weaken those characteristics, and that is by breeding them out. If a lower race mixes with a higher in sufficient numbers, history teaches us that the lower race will prevail.\n\nAs the public voice of the Immigration Restriction League, Lodge argued in support of literacy tests for incoming immigrants. The tests would be designed to exclude members of those races he deemed \"most alien to the body of the American people.\" He proposed that the United States should temporarily shut out all further entries, particularly persons of low education or skill, the more efficiently to assimilate the millions who had come. From 1907 to 1911, he served on the Dillingham Commission, a joint congressional committee established to study the era's immigration patterns and make recommendations to Congress based on its findings. The Commission's recommendations led to the Immigration Act of 1917.\n\nLodge was a staunch advocate of entering World War I on the side of the Allied Powers, attacking President Woodrow Wilson for poor military preparedness and accusing pacifists of undermining American patriotism. After the United States entered the war, Lodge continued to attack Wilson as hopelessly idealistic, assailing Wilson's Fourteen Points as unrealistic and weak. He contended that Germany needed to be militarily and economically crushed and saddled with harsh penalties so that it could never again be a threat to the stability of Europe. However, apart from policy differences, even before the end of Wilson's first term and well before America's entry into the Great War, Lodge confided to Teddy Roosevelt, \"I never expected to hate anyone in politics with the hatred I feel toward Wilson.\"\n\nHe served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (1919–1924). \nHe also served as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference from 1918 to 1924. His leadership of the Senate Republicans has led some to retrospectively call him the de facto Senate Majority Leader. During his term in office, he and another powerful senator, Albert J. Beveridge, pushed for the construction of a new navy.\n\nThe summit of Lodge's Senate career came in 1919, when as the unofficial Senate majority leader, he dealt with the Treaty of Versailles. He wanted to join the League of Nations with reservations. The Democrats in the Senate, following Wilson's direction, rejected Lodge's proposal to join the League with reservations. Republicans opposed joining under Wilson's terms of no reservations which meant the League could force the U.S. to enter a war without approval of Congress. In the end the U.S. never joined the League of Nations. Lodge won in the long run—his reservations were incorporated into the United Nations in 1945, where the U.S. was given a veto.\n\nLodge's key objection to the League of Nations was Article X. It required all signatory nations to repel aggression of any kind if ordered to do so by the League. Lodge rejected an open-ended commitment regardless of relevance to the national security interests of the United States. He especially insisted that Congress must approve. Lodge was also motivated by political concerns; he strongly disliked President Wilson and was eager to find an issue for the Republican Party to run on in the presidential election of 1920.\n\nSenator Lodge argued for a powerful American role in world affairs:\n\nThe United States is the world's best hope, but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her powerful good, and endanger her very existence. Leave her to march freely through the centuries to come, as in the years that have gone. Strong, generous, and confident, she has nobly served mankind. Beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance; this great land of ordered liberty. For if we stumble and fall, freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin.\n\nLodge appealed to the patriotism of American citizens by objecting to what he saw as the weakening of national sovereignty: \"I have loved but one flag and I can not share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented for a league.\"\n\nThe Senate was divided into a \"crazy-quilt\" of positions on the Versailles question. It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty. One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty. A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a Treaty with reservations, especially on Article X, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the United States Congress. Finally, a bi-partisan group of 13 \"irreconcilables\" opposed a treaty in any form. The closest the Treaty came to passage was in mid-November 1919, when Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise. Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson's stroke on September 25, 1919, had so altered his personality that he was unable to effectively negotiate with Lodge. Cooper says the psychological effects of a stroke were profound: \"Wilson's emotions were unbalanced, and his judgment was warped. ... Worse, his denial of illness and limitations was starting to border on delusion.\" \n\nThe Treaty of Versailles went into effect but the United States did not sign it, and made separate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary. The League of Nations went into operation, but the United States never joined. Historians agree that the League was ineffective in dealing with major issues, but they debate whether American membership would have made much difference. In 1945 it was replaced by the United Nations, which assumed many of the League's procedures and peacekeeping functions, although Article X of the League of Nations was notably absent from the UN mandate. That is, the UN was structured in accordance with Lodge's plan, with the United States having a veto power in the UN which it did not have in the old League of Nations. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., Lodge's grandson, served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 1953 to 1960.\n\nIn 1922, President Warren G. Harding appointed Lodge as a delegate to the Washington Naval Conference (International Conference on the Limitation of Armaments), led by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, and included Elihu Root and Oscar Underwood. This was the first disarmament conference in history and had a goal of world peace through arms reduction. Attended by nine nations, the United States, Japan, China, France, Great Britain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal, the conference resulted in three major treaties: Four-Power Treaty, Five-Power Treaty (more commonly known as the Washington Naval Treaty) and the Nine-Power Treaty, as well as a number of smaller agreements.\n\nIn June 1922, he introduced the Lodge-Fish Resolution, to illustrate American support for the British policy in Palestine per the 1917 Balfour Declaration.\n\nHistorian George E. Mowry argues that:\n\nHenry Cabot Lodge was one of the best informed statesmen of his time, he was an excellent parliamentarian, and he brought to bear on foreign questions a mind that was at once razor sharp and devoid of much of the moral cant that was so typical of the age. ... [Yet] Lodge never made the contributions he should have made, largely because of Lodge the person. He was opportunistic, selfish, jealous, condescending, supercilious, and could never resist calling his opponent's spade a dirty shovel. Small wonder that except for Roosevelt and Root, most of his colleagues of both parties disliked him, and many distrusted him.\n\nLodge served on the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution for many years. His first appointment was in 1890, as a Member of the House of Representatives, and he served until his election as a senator in 1893. He was reappointed to the Board in 1905 and served until he died in 1924. The other Regents considered Lodge to be a \"distinguished colleague, whose keen, constructive interest in the affairs of the Institution led him to place his broad knowledge and large experience at its service at all times.\"\n\nMount Lodge, also named \"Boundary Peak 166\", located on the Canada–United States border in the Saint Elias Mountains was named in 1908 after him in recognition of his service as U.S. Boundary Commissioner in 1903.\n\nIn 1871, he married Anna \"Nannie\" Cabot Mills Davis, daughter of Admiral Charles Henry Davis. They had three children:\n\nOn November 5, 1924, Lodge suffered a severe stroke while recovering in the hospital from surgery for gallstones. He died four days later at the age of 74.\nHe was interred in the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the next decades business architecture has developed into a discipline of \"cross-organizational design of the business as a whole\" closely related to enterprise architecture. The concept of business architecture has been proposed as a blueprint of the enterprise, as business strategy, and also as the representation of business design.\n\nThe concept of business architecture has evolved over the years. It was introduced in the 1980s as architectural domains and as activity of business design. In the 2000s the study and concept development of business architecture accelerated. By the end of the 2000s the first handbooks on business architecture were published, separate frameworks for business architecture were being developed, separate views and models for business architecture were further under construction, the business architect as a profession evolved, and more businesses added business architecture to their agenda.\n\nBy 2015 business architecture has evolved into a common practice. The business architecture body of knowledge has been developed and is updated multiple times each year, and the interest from the academic world and from top management is growing.\n\nBusiness architecture has its roots in traditional cross-organizational design. Bodine and Hilty (2009) stipulated, that the \"responsibility for the cross-organizational design of the business as a whole, the work of the Business Architect, has historically fallen to the CEO or their assignee, supported by generalist management consulting firms whose teams of MBAs work with corporate managers to transform strategy into new business configurations using the newest tools.\" John Zachman (2012) commented in this context, that \"a lot of material has been written about business architecture (by some definition), going back to \"The Principles of Scientific Management\" (1911) by Frederick Taylor.\"\n\nOne of the roots of business architecture lies in the proposals for enterprise architecture made since the 1980s and 1990s. Bernus & Noran (2010) distinguished two types of proposals. On the one hand \"Proposals that created generally applicable ‘blueprints’ (later to be called reference models, partial models...) so that the activities involved in the creation (or the change) of the enterprise could refer to such a common model (or set of models).\" And on the other hand \"proposals which claimed that to be able to organise the creation, and later the change, of enterprises one needs to understand the life cycle of the enterprise and of its parts... the ‘Enterprise Reference Architecture’.\"\n\nMore specific about the emerge of business architecture Whelan & Meaden (2012) described, that this emerged against a backdrop of change. The business architecture is \"maturing into a discipline in its own right, rising from the pool of inter-related practices that include business strategy, enterprise architecture, business portfolio planning and change management – to name but a few.\n\nThe concept of business architecture emerged in the 1980s in the field of information systems development. One of the first to mention business architecture was the British management consultant Edwin E. Tozer in the 1986 article \"Developing strategies for management information systems.\" He introduced the concept of business architecture in the context of business information systems planning, and distinguished:\nAnd he explained, that \"each entity class in the Information Architecture is represented in some database and each business function may be supported by one or more systems.\" In this paper Tozer was \"prescriptive about the order in which [strategy] issues should be identified.\", and focussed on \"IS adaptability to organizational strategies.\"\n\nThe American organizational theorist William R. Synnott (1987) presented one of the first models of business architecture, (see image), in the context of data management. Synnott wanted to develop an overall Information Resource Management (IRM) architecture, and proposed business architecture as its foundation. He described: \n\nBusiness architecture is the foundation upon which the IRM architecture rests. The architectural model consists of a set of building-blocks of linked architectures which together form the basis for the technology infrastructure of the firm... In the figure data architecture and communication architecture are shown as horizontal bars because these are corporate-wide information resource components. They serve all business units. The four vertical resource components are business specific. The resources can be divided according to the business units they serve. That us, data and communication might be centralizes resources, whereas human resources (professional systems staffs), computers, user-computing, and systems could all be decentralized resources to one degree or another.\n\nThis model of Information Resource Management (IRM) distinguished seven types of architecture: \n\nThis type of architectural model classifies different types of architecture. In the later theories and models different sets of architectures have been proposed. For example, the late 1980s NIST Enterprise Architecture Model distinguished five types, and this was incorporated in the 1990s Federal Enterprise Architecture, which contained four types of architecture.\n\nSynnott (1987) furthermore described, how business architecture should work and introduced the idea of architectural planning:\n\nThe business architecture of the company (organization structure, strategic business units and missions, product and services) is the foundation of IRM planning. Since every company has an existing architecture, architectural planning begins with an inventory of the firm's information resources. Assembling the various information resource components' inventories results in an \"as is\" picture of the corporation's technology structure. From this inventory, the CIO can analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the company's information resources, particularly as they relate to business information needs as identified in the strategic planning process. From this analysis one can evolve an architectural plan, which is a \"to be\" picture of where one wants to go and how to get there, not just a picture of the status quo.\n\nCees J. Schrama. (1988) of the European IFIP Technical Committee on Information Systems IFIP TC8 presented the opinion, that \"business architecture is required to provide a solid base for the total development process.\" He pictured another model consisted of elements such as information processing architecture and network architecture, and explained:\n\n[Business architecture] contains the fundamentals for the information processing architecture, where process data, support systems and network architecture are performed. In business architecture the following can 'be identified:\nThere are some basic elements in business architecture: management, organization, processes to be performed and data to be made available/delivered. In the past, when mainly operational systems were developed, the processes received considerable attention. Information was seen as being needed to perform processes. This is changing. It is becoming important to have data available to serve information retrieval needs as well.\n\nThese ideas around the concept of architectural planning evolved in th early 1990s into frameworks, such as TAFIM, the predecessor of TOGAF.\n\nIn the 1987 article \"A Framework for Information Systems Architecture\" John Zachman presented some of the principles of Enterprise architecture,\n\nIn the 5th NIST workshop on Information Management Directions (1989) a working groups under guidance of W. Bradford Rigdon developed one of the first Enterprise Architecture frameworks, the NIST Enterprise Architecture Model. In this model business architecture was incorporated as one of the layers of Enterprise Architecture. Bradford Rigdon et al. (1989) brought it like this:\n\nA discussion of architecture must take into account different levels of architecture. These levels can be illustrated by a pyramid, with the business unit at the top and the delivery system at the base. An enterprise is composed of one or more Business Units that are responsible for a specific business area. The five levels of architecture are\nThe levels are separate yet interrelated... The idea if an enterprise architecture reflects an awareness that the levels are logically connected and that a depiction at one level assumes or dictates that architectures at the higher level.\n\nIn the original 1989 illustration of the NIST AE Framework (see image) the top layer was named \"Business Unit Architecture.\" In representation of this model in the 1990s the top layer was named \"Business architecture.\"\n\nIn the 1990s the information age was unfolding changing the global market economy. With the businesses adapting, the new concept of business architecture was presented as promising alternative. Gharajedaghi (1999) explained the context:\n\nIn a global market economy with ever-increasing levels of disturbance, a viable business can no longer be locked into a single form or function. Success comes from a self-renewing capability to spontaneously create structures and functions that fit the moment. In this context, proper functioning of self-reference would certainly prevent the vacillations and the random search for new products/markets that have, over the past years, destroyed so many businesses.In fact, the ability to continuously match the portfolio of internal competencies with the portfolio of emerging market opportunities is the foundation of the emerging concept of new business architecture...\n\nAccording to Bodine and Hilty (2009) \"important advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of Michael Hammer and James Champy‘s book \"Reengineering the Corporation\", which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The Balanced Scorecard developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions.\"\n\nIn the 1990s works the concept of business architecture is presented in distinguished ways: \n\nBusiness architectures is presented as tool for change management, acknowledged Van Rensburg (1997). It \"provide organisations with the means to understand organisational activities in such a manner that it is used as a mechanism to support the organisation through the business transformation process. Using an object-oriented modelling approach in the design of the business architecture allows for a robust modelling approach which captures real world instances in a business architecture repository. This enables the creation and caption of organisational understanding required for the transformation process.\"\n\nIn 1996 the US government introduced the Clinger–Cohen Act, to improve the acquisition and management of their information resources.\n\nBeside the enterprise architecture frameworks a second type of architectural models were proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which were called Enterprise Reference Architecture. \n\nIn 1999 two works on business architecture and its foundation were published, which became two of the most cited works on business architecture. In his \"Systems thinking: Managing chaos and complexity\" Jamshid Gharajedaghi presented a set of principles to design business architecture, which were based on systems thinking. Gharajedaghi argued, that business Architecture should be considered a system:\n\nBusiness Architecture is a general description of a system. It identifies its purpose, vital functions, active elements, and critical processes and defines the nature of the interaction among them. Business architecture consists of a set of distinct but interrelated platforms, creating a multidimensional modular system. Each platform represents a dimension of the system, signifying a unique mode of behavior with a predefined set of performance criteria and measures.\n\nThe IBM researcher Douglas W. McDavid presented the paper \"A standard for business architecture description.\" According to Evernden & Evernden (2003) this paper described a \"high-level semantic framework of standard business concepts – abstracted from experience, enterprise business models, the organization of business terminology and the various generic industry reference models. There is an excellent discussion on what constitutes business architecture and the nature and use of information categories, although concepts such as product and agreement seem to be missing.\" McDavid argued:\n\nThe concepts in the Business Architecture description provide a semantic framework for speaking about common business concerns... For our purposes, this semantic structure provides a common set of concept patterns to be able to understand the types of content that needs to be supported in technology-based information systems... a set of generic concepts and their interrelationships organize business information content in terms of requirements on the business, the boundary of the business, and the business as a system for delivery of value.\n\nAccording to Bodine and Hilty (2009)\n\nThe arrival of Internet technologies like email, instant messaging and online data repositories in the mid-1990s opened up tremendous flexibilities in the ways co-workers could collaborate, while the new ability of buyers and sellers to interact in virtual space and transact online changed the traditional structure of businesses...\nBy the late 1990s, MBAs with advanced skills in Internet technologies began developing live business models for e-commerce websites in real-time. They used the development tools to both represent and build the business at the same time. The model became the business, and thousands were launched, allowing companies to access vast volumes of data and respond rapidly to changing market conditions... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ at the time returned just 12 results... A Google search on ―Business Architect‖ in 2009 returns over 1 million listings.\nThis is just the beginning of a valuable and rapidly expanding profession. Today‘s Business Architects take a holistic view of the complete business representing all interests and engaging all expertise. They see the business organization as a constantly changing, dynamic organism that balances central planning with individual initiative to achieve its mission through the articulate implementation of its corporate strategy.\n\nAccording to Bodine and Hilty (2009)\n\nImportant advances in this area borrowed from the operations discipline came in 1993 in the form of Michael Hammer and James Champy‘s book \"Reengineering the Corporation\", which introduced tools for mapping and optimizing business activities using process modeling. The Balanced Scorecard developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton at about the same time enabled the business to measure overall corporate success against goals on qualitative as well as quantitative dimensions.\n\nAccording to Bernus & Noran (2010):\nArchitecture Frameworks have been used in many industries, including the domains of industrial automation / manufacturing / production management, business information systems (of various kinds), telecommunications and defence. Part of the Enterprise Architecture practice is ‘enterprise engineering’ and the practice of ‘enterprise modelling’ (or just modelling) and complete AFs describe the scope of modelling (which later can be summaised as a Modelling Framework that is part of the AF).\n\nOne specific type of Framework is called the \"Enterprise Reference Architecture.\" According to Bernus & Noran (2010):\nSeveral proposals emerged in those two decades – e.g. PERA (Williams 1994), CIMOSA (CIMOSA Association 1996), ARIS (Scheer 1999), GRAI-GIM (Doumeingts, 1987), and the IFIP-IFAC Task Force, based on a thorough review of these as well as their proposed generalisation (Bernus and Nemes, 1994) developed GERAM (IFIP-IFAC Task Force, 1999) which then became the basis of ISO15704:2000 “Industrial automation systems – Requirements for enterprise-reference architectures and methodologies”...\n\nThe Business Architecture Special Interest Group (BASIG) is a working group on business architecture of the Object Management Group (OMG). This working group was founded in 2007 as the Business Architecture Working Group (BAWG).\n\nIn the 2006 article \"Business Architecture: A new paradigm to relate business strategy to ICT,\" Versteeg & Bouwman explained the relation between business architecture, business activities and business strategy. They wrote:\nWe use the concept of 'Business Architecture’ to structure the responsibility over business activities prior to any further effort to structure individual aspects (processes, data, functions, organization, etc.). The business architecture arranges the responsibilities around the most important business activities (for instance production, distribution, marketing, et cetera) and/or economic activities (for instance manufacturing, assembly, transport, wholesale, et cetera) into domains \n\nVersteeg & Bouwman also stipulated, that \"the perspectives for subsequent design next to organization are more common: information architecture, technical architecture, process architecture. The various parts (functions, concepts and processes) of the business architecture act as a compulsory starting point for the different subsequent architectures. It pre-structures other architectures. Business architecture models shed light on the scantly elaborated relationships between business strategy and business design. We will illustrate the value of business architecture in a case study.\"\n\nIn the 2010 the first handbooks on Business architecture were published. In the US William M. Ulrich and Neal McWhorter of the OMG Business Architecture Special Interest Group published the \"Business Architecture: The Art and Practice of Business Transformation,\" in 2010.\n\nIn 2012 in Britain the business consultants Jonathan Whelan and Graham Meaden published their \"Business Architecture: A Practical Guide.\"\n\nIn several sources in the exact definition of \"business architecture\" is under review. InN 2008 Jeff Scott had commented in this matter: \nInterest in business architecture is growing dramatically. During the past two years both IT and business leaders have joined the discussion about the need for a well-defined business architecture. Though there is a great deal of discussion, there is little consensus about what business architecture is, how it should be pursued, and what value it delivers. Business architects in IT as well as in the business have started developing business-unit-wide and enterprise-wide business architectures, learning as they go. Their ultimate goals are to improve business decision-making and facilitate better alignment between IT and the business units it supports. Architecture teams that want to play a leading role in business architecture development must start soon or be left behind.\n\nOther sources came to the same conclusion, that over the years many different definitions of business architecture have been proposed Some of the more notable definitions have described business architecture as: \n\nThe discussion kept going. John Zachman (2012) declared in this matter, that \"a lot of people define business architecture differently (I know a lot of people who have a lot of different opinions and definitions for business architecture). Not too many people do business architecture, at least not in a comprehensive and definitive fashion (in my estimation)...\" \nIdeas and definitions about business architecture originate from different academic sub disciplines, where the concept of business architecture and methods and techniques are developing in numerous initiatives. A selection of related subfields:\n\nGuitarte (2013) stipulated, that also different types of organizations have been active, and created a so-called \"business architecture vortex.” He listed four types:\n\nGuitarte commented, that \"influencers led followed by communities of practice and standards-setting bodies; vendors followed. Conflicting ideas provide opportunity to define the future of business architecture profession.\"\n\nSurveys have reported a growing interest of management in business architecture, as well as on universities:\n\n\n"}

Benn, Church of Ireland rector of Carrigaline and Douglas, and his wife Maria (née Hamilton). He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and then joined Price & Pierce Ltd, a leading timber firm. He later became a director and then chairman.\n\nIn 1885 he married Frances Charlotte Bridges, with whom he had two children.\n\nIn 1900, he was elected to Greenwich Borough Council and served as mayor from 1901 to 1902. He was a founder member of the Metropolitan Water Board in 1903. He was a Municipal Reform Party member of London County Council representing Greenwich from 1907 to 1910. At the 1906 general election he was chosen by the Tariff Reform faction in the Conservative Party to stand against Lord Hugh Cecil the sitting Conservative MP for Greenwich who was in favour of free trade. While Benn succeeded in beating Cecil, the split in the Conservative vote allowed Richard Stephens Jackson of the Liberal Party to take the seat. At the next general election in January 1910 he was the sole Conservative candidate in the constituency and was elected to parliament. In parliament, he was a leading opponent of Irish Home Rule.\n\nOn 26 May 1906 he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, which on 1 April 1908 became the 20th Battalion, London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich).\n\nA long-time member of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, Benn saw active service in the First World War, being commissioned into the Royal Naval Reserve with the temporary rank of lieutenant-commander on 12 October 1914, and receiving promotion to temporary commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve on 10 April 1915.\n\nFor three years he was the commander of a flotilla of motor launches in the Dover Patrol, taking part in the Zeebrugge Raid and the First and Second Ostend Raids.\n\nHe was Mentioned in Despatches three times, and on 20 July 1917 was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order in recognition of his services at Zeebrugge on the 11–12 May 1917, and at Ostend on 4–5 June 1917. He was also awarded the \"Croix de Guerre\" by France in recognition of his services at Zeebrugge and at Ostend on 22–23 April 1918, and on 28 August 1918 was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (Military Division), in recognition of his distinguished services during the Second Ostend Raid.\n\nBenn was created a baronet in the June 1920 Birthday Honours for his political services. He retired from parliament at the 1922 election.\n\nOn 23 June 1925 Benn was made a knight of the Grand Priory of the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in England, and on 11 May 1926 received the Territorial Decoration.

The zone spans from the western part of Urayasu in the northeast to Futtsu in the southeast of the region. The zone has no political or administrative status.\n\nThe name of the industrial zone is formed from two kanji characters. The first, , means \"capital city\" and refers to Tokyo. The second, , meaning \"leaf\", is the second kanji in \"Chiba\" and refers to Chiba Prefecture, and the compound refers to the Tokyo-Chiba region.\n\nThe Keiyō Industrial Zone spans the coast of Tokyo Bay from Urayasu in the northeast, through Funabashi, Chiba City, Kisarazu, Kimitsu, Ichihara, Sodegaura, and ends in Futtsu to the southeast. Numerous small rivers empty into the industrial region, and provide a source of water to support industry. They include the Edo River, the Yōrō River, and the Koito River.\n\nBefore industrialization the Keiyō region was originally home to \"nori\" seaweed collection, the shellfish industry, mixed small-scale fishing and agricultural villages, and beach resorts. The Keihin region, spanning west from Tokyo to Yokohama, was developed after World War I. With the rapid development of the defense industry in Japan from the beginning of the Shōwa period in 1926, a plan for the decentralization of industry from the immediate Tokyo area was planned in 1935.\nThe Keiyō Industrial Region was fully developed after World War II. Some land reclamation had been carried out in coastal areas of Tokyo Bay as part of the industrialization of Japan in the early 20th century. Reclaimed land areas replaced traditional fishing areas and supported small factories. The construction of the Kawasaki Steel Works in Chiba City in 1953 marked the beginning of the large-scale construction of heavy industry infrastructure in the industrial zone, and other industries soon followed. The deepwater ports of the Keiyō Industrial Zone were built starting in the 1950s. Thermal power generators were built, and large tracts of land were reclaimed from the bay for expansion of the Keiyō region. Keiyō was significantly expanded in the 1960s. Heavy metal and chemical production were among the highest in Japan by the 1970s.\n\nThe zone is a major base for the electric power generation, petrochemical, petroleum, shipbuilding, logistics, shipping, and steel industries.

Its name is derived from Rampart Boulevard, one of the principal thoroughfares in its patrol area. The original station was located at 2710 West Temple Street. It has since moved southeast to a newer facility located at 1401 West 6th Street, the site of the former Emergency Receiving Hospital. With 164,961 residents occupying a area, Rampart is one of Los Angeles's most densely populated communities.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department’s (LAPD) Rampart Division (#02) was created in October 1966. It was formed from portions of LAPD’s Central, Wilshire, University (now Southwest), and Hollywood Areas. William H. Parker was the Chief of Police at the time, and he stated that the new Rampart Division was needed to decrease the span between the Metropolitan, Hollywood, and Wilshire Areas. Several locations for the original station were considered before the Rampart Heights area was finally chosen in 1961. In 1963, the property at the southwest corner of Temple St and Benton Way was obtained, and construction began in December 1964. The total cost of the site, design, construction, equipment and furnishings was $1,419,397.\n\nThe LAPD Rampart Division Station, located at 2710 West Temple Street officially opened on October 23, 1966 under the command of Captain R. O. Bradley. Rampart Area spanned approximately 13.7 square miles and served approximately 200,000 citizens. Its borders at the time were: Normandie Ave on the west; Santa Monica Bl, Hyperion Ave, and the Los Angeles River to the North; the 110-Pasadena/Harbor Freeway to the east; and the 10-Santa Monica Freeway to the south. As the population grew and more personnel were needed to serve the area, space became an issue. Detective functions were eventually relocated to a separate building, located at 303 S. Union Avenue.\n\nAfter 40 years of wear and tear, the time came to replace the original station on Temple St. A decision was made to build the new station on the site where the aging Central Receiving Hospital was currently located.The new Rampart Community Police Station, located at 1401 W. 6th St., opened its doors on July 25, 2008 under the command of Captain III John Egan and Captain I Paul Hernandez. It was assigned approximately 275 Police Officers, 55 Detectives, and 50 civilian personnel. The new station re-united Rampart Patrol and Detectives under one roof again, serving approximately 375,000 people in an 8 square mile area.\n\nSoon after the new Rampart Station opened, the LAPD created a new Division, the Olympic Area (#20). On January 4, 2009, Olympic Community Police Station opened its doors and assumed responsibility for a portion of what was formerly the west side of Rampart Division, from Normandie to Hoover Street. Currently, Rampart Division has about 330 personnel that provide service to approximately 164,961 inhabitants in a compact 5.54 square mile area. The population density of the Rampart Area is similar to Manhattan Island. It serves the communities of Angelino Heights, Echo Park, Silver Lake, Historic Filipinotown, Korea Town, Lafayette Park, Macarthur Park, Pico-Union, Temple-Beaudry, Virgil Village, and Westlake.\n\nThe Rampart CPAB remains active with committees addressing specific issues such as traffic, crime, youth programs, and membership. Each member is independently active in the community and has the ability to relay information to thousands of community members. CPAB members provide an extremely valuable service to the Rampart Area as they are able to relay the pulse and sentiment of the community at any given time.\n\nCommunity-Police Advisory Boards (C-PABs) were created in 1993 to provide community members with an opportunity to provide information and advice to their respective Area and to take information from the police department back to the community. Each of the 21 geographic Areas (community police stations) throughout Los Angeles has its own C-PAB. These advisory groups meet monthly to discuss crime and quality of life issues. Each C-PAB has two co-chairs, one of the Area commanding officer while the second is a civilian member voted on by the membership. Recently, many C-PABs have formed subcommittees in addition to the general group to tackle specific crime and quality of life problems. Examples of C-PAB subcommittees include Graffiti, Youth, Homeless Outreach and Traffic.\n\nThrough a network of Neighborhood Councils, the City of Los Angeles promotes public participation in government and works to improve government responsiveness to local concerns.\n\nThere are numerous criminal street gangs in the Rampart Area. They include, but are not limited to: 18th St, Mara Salvatrucha, Echo Park, Rockwood, Crazy Riders, Temple St, Witmer St, Clanton 14, Burlington locos, Wanderers, Varrio Vista Rifa, Head Hunters, Diamond St, Big Top Locos, and La Mirada Locos.\n\nGang injunctions have been helpful in curbing gang crimes and violence in the Rampart Area.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 9, 2004, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Los Angeles Police received a 911 call of a man with a gun attempting to take a hostage inside the Mexican Consulate at 2401 W. 6th Street. Rampart Division Patrol Officers responded, and while setting up a perimeter saw a male suspect leave the building with a woman he was holding hostage. The suspect was holding her tightly from behind, with his arm around her neck and was armed with what appeared to be a handgun. Sergeant Hector Feliciano fired one round from his handgun, striking the suspect, who released the hostage and fell to the ground. The suspect was later identified as 19-year-old Manuel Jubenal Ortiz, and the gun he was carrying was determined to be a starter pistol. The victim, 31-year-old Dunia Gonzalez, who was pregnant and an employee of the Mexican Consulate, was not injured. She was taken safely away from the scene by another Rampart officer. The suspect, who was injured in the officer involved shooting, was taken by rescue ambulance to the University of Southern California Medical Center (USCMC), where he later died. The FBI was handling the criminal investigation with assistance from Robbery-Homicide Division. The drama unfolded on live TV. Sergeant Feliciano received the LAPD's Medal of Valor and an honorable mention commendation at the TOP COPS Award Ceremony, by NAPO.\n\nOn September 11, 2012, Rampart officers observed a vehicle reported stolen at gunpoint earlier in the day from the North Hollywood Area. Officers attempted to pull it over about 6 p.m. near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Rosemont Avenue but the suspect refused, leading police on a pursuit through Echo Park, Silver Lake and downtown for more than an hour. During the pursuit officers recognized the suspect as a person wanted in connection with a homicide earlier in the year. The chase ended when the driver crashed into another vehicle at the intersection of South Bixel and West 7th streets. The suspect exited the stolen car with an assault rifle and engaged officers in shoot-out until he was wounded and taken into custody. No officers were hurt. The civilian from the car that the suspect crashed into was rescued by officers and led away to safety. For their actions of bravery above and beyond the call of duty, officers from LAPD's Rampart, Olympic, and Metropolitan Divisions were recognized at a White House ceremony by President Barack Obama, and honored with the prestigious Top Cop Award by NAPO.\n\nThe Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (CRASH) anti-gang program initiated under the direction of LAPD Chief Daryl F. Gates in the late 1970s had encountered some success in the Rampart Division. However, in 1998–2000, graphic allegations of extreme police misconduct among Rampart's CRASH squad began to emerge. This misconduct involved several officers and detectives, most notably Rafael Perez. Perez was suspected of being involved in a bank robbery committed by another Rampart Division officer, David Mack; he also stole 6 lbs. of cocaine from an LAPD evidence locker, which eventually led to his arrest. His most egregious act involved the shooting—and framing—of unarmed gang member Javier Ovando. Perez originally claimed that Ovando had opened fire at both Perez and another officer, Nino Durden. The two officers then returned fire, leaving Ovando paralyzed. Perez and Durden then framed Ovando for the attack, and he was found guilty and sentenced to 23 years in prison (Ovando was released when Perez admitted to shooting and framing him). After several other incidents, the LAPD became suspicious of Perez and began to investigate him. Perez later pleaded guilty to the cocaine theft in exchange for information about other corrupt officers within the Rampart Division. In turn, Perez implicated approximately 70 officers of misconduct.\n\nAlthough not set in the Rampart Division, the long-running television series \"Adam-12\" featured the Rampart Division station on Temple Street as the setting for the series. However, according to the radio call sign of the unit \"1-Adam 12\", the station is actually the Central Division station (Division One), which serves Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nSouthland featured the new Rampart Division station at 1401 W. 6th St in roll call room and station scenes. The critically acclaimed series ran from 2009 to 2013. Southland takes a \"raw and authentic look\" at Los Angeles and the lives of the LAPD officers who police it. The show's first season centers on the experiences and interactions of LAPD patrol officers and detectives, and is more a character-driven drama than a police procedural. Among the characters are rookie Officer Ben Sherman and his training officer, John Cooper who, unknown to most of his colleagues, is homosexual; Detective Lydia Adams, who must balance work with the responsibility of living with her mother; Officer Chickie Brown, who aspires to be the first woman on the LAPD's elite SWAT team; and Detective Sammy Bryant, whose home life interferes with his working life. After its first season on NBC, Southland moved to TNT network. The second season placed less emphasis on the ensemble cast, instead focusing more on the Adams, Sherman, Cooper and Bryant characters and their partners. Also, the weekly stories centered more on how crimes came together, with fewer serialized story lines.\n\nThe 1988 film \"Colors,\" starring Academy Award–winning actors Robert Duvall and Sean Penn (and directed by Dennis Hopper), attempted to realistically show police work by portraying the lives of a veteran and a rookie LAPD officer partnered together in a gang-infested part of Los Angeles. The film actually uses the real-life CRASH acronym as the division Duvall and Penn's characters are working under.\n\nThe 2001 film \"Training Day\" starred Academy Award-winner Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke (and was directed by Antoine Fuqua). The film, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of a young LAPD officer, Jake Hoyt (Hawke), as he is subjected to a uniquely challenging evaluation by Alonzo Harris (Washington), a highly decorated detective with the LAPD narcotics division, to see if he has what it takes to be a \"narc\" (narcotics officer). The entire film takes place over a single intense 24-hour period in Los Angeles. It was partly based on and heavily influenced by the Rampart Division CRASH unit and the surrounding scandal.\n\nIn the 2004 film, Crash, an off-duty black police officer is shot by an off-duty white officer in a turn of events very similar to the shooting of Kevin Gaines. The said black officer is, later, found to be corrupt, just like in the case of Kevin Gaines. However, in the film the corrupt nature of the black officer is suppressed by the city district attorney in order to not lose the black vote.\n\nFX Networks' hit series \"The Shield\" is inspired by Rampart's C.R.A.S.H. unit. Originally called \"Rampart\" when the first ads were run, the show's title was later changed at the request of the LAPD. By calling the show \"Rampart\", the LAPD claimed that the show's graphic content would portray them as corrupt. Consequently, the show was set up in the fictional Farmington Division (\"the Farm\") of Los Angeles (based on East and South Central Los Angeles), using a converted church (\"the Barn\") as their police station. The show primarily follows the activities of Detective Vic Mackey (portrayed by Emmy winner Michael Chiklis) and the corrupt detectives under his command, Shane Vendrell, Curtis Lemansky, and Ronnie Gardocki, who make up the \"Strike Team\", a special experimental LAPD unit specializing in anti-gang activity and anti-drug and weapon trafficking.\n\nAnother portrayal of the Rampart Scandal can be seen in the film \"Dirty\", which follows two corrupt members of an LAPD anti-gang unit (portrayed by Clifton Collins, Jr. and Academy Award winner Cuba Gooding, Jr.) through a day at work, showing actions such as the killing of gang members, theft of narcotics evidence, and planting of evidence on shooting victims, and showing the eventual consequences of these actions.\n\nEcho Park is a novel by Michael Connelly. A serendipitous traffic stop in L.A.'s Echo Park neighborhood nabs Reynard Waits, a man with body parts in his van on the floorboard in front of the front seat. Detective Freddy Olivas is working the case and Richard O'Shea is the prosecutor assigned. Soon Waits has confessed to a string of slayings involving prostitutes and runaways, as well as to two earlier murders: one of a pawnshop owner during the 1992 riots, the other of Marie Gesto.\n\nIn 2010, the crime drama movie Faster featured a police officer played by Billy Bob Thornton who is revealed to be a corrupt former Rampart CRASH officer.\n\n\"Rampart\" is a 2011 feature film derived from the Rampart Scandal and starring Woody Harrelson, Ben Foster and Ice Cube. Based on a James Ellroy screenplay that covers both the scandal and the LAPD C.R.A.S.H. units involved, the film was directed and co-written by Oren Moverman. Harrelson portrays Dave Brown, a personally and professionally conflicted LAPD officer caught up in the aftermath of the scandal which brings him to the attention of Kyle Timkins (Ice Cube) as an internal affairs investigator. Filming was completed in December, 2010 in LA.\n\nThe plot of Rockstar Games' controversial video game \"\", set in 1992 in a fictional version of Los Angeles, involves two corrupt CRASH officers and one that disagrees with the others. The CRASH motto, \"intimidate those who intimidate others\", is spoken directly by one of these characters during the course of the game.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "267793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=267793", "title": "Legal tender", "text": "Legal tender\n\nLegal tender is a medium of payment recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation. Paper currency and coins are common forms of legal tender in many countries. Legal tender is variously defined in different jurisdictions. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal cheques, credit cards, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. Coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a license to perform financial transactions in a foreign currency.\n\nGenerally, designation of a particular form of money as legal tender means \"that the designated money is valid payment for all debts unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary\". In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. Under the law, United States money as identified above is a valid and legal offer of payment for antecedent debts when tendered to a creditor. By contrast, federal statutes do not require that someone who is not a pre-existing creditor must accept currency or coins as payment for goods or services. Private businesses may formulate their own policies on whether to accept cash unless state law requires otherwise.\n\nThe right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective.\n\nThe term \"legal tender\" is from Middle English \"tendren\", French \"tendre\" (verb form), meaning \"to offer\". The \"Latin\" root is \"tendere\" (to stretch out), and the sense of \"tender\" as an \"offer\" is related to the etymology of the English word \"extend\" (to hold outward).\n\nDemonetization is the act of stripping a currency unit of its status as legal tender. It occurs whenever there is a change of national currency: The current form or forms of money is pulled from circulation and retired, often to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with new currency.\n\nThe opposite of demonetization is remonetization, in which a form of payment is restored as legal tender.\n\nCoins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same currency replace them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one. Examples of this are:\n\n\nIndividual coins or banknotes can be demonetised and cease to be legal tender (for example, the pre-decimal United Kingdom farthing or the Bank of England 1 pound note), but the Bank of England does redeem all Bank of England banknotes by exchanging them for legal tender currency at its counters in London (or by post) regardless of how old they are. Banknotes issued by retail banks in the UK (Scotland and Northern Ireland) are not legal tender, but one of the criteria for legal protection under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act is that banknotes must be payable on demand, therefore withdrawn notes remain a liability of the issuing bank without any time limits.\n\nIn the case of the euro, coins and banknotes of former national currencies were in some cases considered legal tender from 1 January 1999 until 28 February 2002. Legally, those coins and banknotes were considered non-decimal sub-divisions of the euro.\n\nWhen the Iraqi Swiss dinar ceased to be legal tender in Iraq, it still circulated in the northern Kurdish regions, and despite lacking government backing, it had a stable market value for more than a decade. This example is often cited to demonstrate that the value of a currency is not derived purely from its legal status (but this currency would not be legal tender).\n\nThis is also true of the paper money issued by the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. The Confederate currency became worthless by its own terms after the war, since it could only be redeemed a stated number of years after a peace treaty was signed between the Confederacy and the United States (which never happened, as the Confederacy was defeated and dissolved).\n\nDemonetisation is currently prohibited in the United States, and the Coinage Act of 1965 applies to all US coins and currency regardless of age. The closest historical equivalent in the US, other than Confederate money, was from 1933 to 1974, when the government banned most private ownership of gold bullion, including gold coins held for non-numismatic purposes. Now, however, even surviving pre-1933 gold coins are legal tender under the 1964 act.\n\nBanknotes and coins may be withdrawn from circulation, but remain legal tender. United States banknotes issued at any date remain legal tender even after they are withdrawn from circulation. Canadian 1- and 2-dollar bills remain legal tender even if they have been withdrawn and replaced by coins, but Canadian $1,000 bills remain legal tender even if they are removed from circulation as they arrive at a bank. However, Bank of England notes that are withdrawn from circulation generally cease to be legal tender but remain redeemable for current currency at the Bank of England itself or by post. All paper and polymer issues of New Zealand banknotes issued from 1967 onwards (and 1- and 2-dollar notes until 1993) are still legal tender; however, 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins are no longer used in New Zealand.\n\nA cashless society describes an economic state whereby financial transactions are not conducted with money in the form of physical banknotes or coins, but rather through the transfer of digital information (usually an electronic representation of money) between the transacting parties. Cashless societies have existed, based on barter and other methods of exchange, and cashless transactions have also become possible using digital currencies such as bitcoin. However this article discussesand focuses on the term \"cashless society\" in the sense of a move towards, and implications of, a society where cash is replaced by its digital equivalent – in other words, legal tender (money) exists, is recorded, and is exchanged only in electronic digital form.\n\nSometimes currency issues such as commemorative coins or transfer bills may be issued that are not intended for public circulation but are nonetheless legal tender. An example of such currency is Maundy money. Some currency issuers, particularly the Scottish banks, issue special commemorative banknotes which are intended for ordinary circulation (though no Scottish banknotes nor notes from Northern Ireland are legal tender in the United Kingdom). As well, some standard coins are minted on higher-quality dies as 'uncirculated' versions of the coin, for collectors to purchase at a premium; these coins are nevertheless legal tender. Some countries issue precious-metal coins which have a currency value indicated on them which is far below the value of the metal the coin contains: these coins are known as \"non-circulating legal tender\" or \"NCLT\".\n\nIn Australia, the creation of legal tender, in the form of notes and base metal coins, is the exclusive right of the Commonwealth (Federal) Government. According to section 115 of the Australian Constitution, \"A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts.\" Under this provision the Perth Mint, owned by the Western Australian Government, still produces gold and silver coins with legal tender status, the Australian Gold Nugget and Australian Silver Kookaburra. These, however, although having the status of legal tender, are almost never circulated or used in payment of debts, and are mostly considered bullion coins.\n\nAustralian notes are legal tender for all amounts, as established by the \"Reserve Bank Act 1959\". Under the provisions of the \"Currency Act 1965\" Australian coins intended for general circulation, which are now produced at the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra, are also legal tender, but only for the following amounts:\n\nThe one cent and two cent coins have been withdrawn from circulation since February 1992 but remain legal tender.\n\nAlthough the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and the Currency Act 1965 establishes that Australian banknotes and coins have legal tender status, Australian banknotes and coins do not necessarily have to be used in transactions and refusal to accept payment in legal tender is not unlawful. It appears that a provider of goods or services is at liberty to set the commercial terms upon which payment will take place before the \"contract\" for supply of the goods or services is entered into. If a provider of goods or services specifies other means of payment prior to the contract, then there is usually no obligation for legal tender to be accepted as payment. This is the case even when an existing debt is involved. However, refusal to accept legal tender in payment of an existing debt, where no other means of payment/settlement has been specified in advance, conceivably could have consequences in legal proceedings.\n\nAustralia Post prohibits the sending of coins or banknotes, of any country, except via Registered Post.\n\nIn 1901, notes in circulation in Australia consisted of bank notes payable in gold coin and issued by the trading banks, and Queensland Treasury notes. Bank notes circulated in all States except Queensland, but were not legal tender except for a brief period in 1893 in New South Wales. There were, however, some restrictions on their issue and other provisions for the protection of the public. Queensland Treasury notes were issued by the Queensland Government and were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the Commonwealth Parliament passed the \"Australian Notes Act 1910\" and the \"Bank Notes Tax Act 1910\". The \"Australian Notes Act 1910\" prohibited the circulation of state notes as money, and the \"Bank Notes Tax Act 1910\" imposed a tax of ten per cent, per annum, on \"all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth after the commencement of this Act, and not redeemed\". These Acts effectively put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury. \"The Reserve Bank Act 1959\" expressly prohibits persons and states from issuing \"a bill or note for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation\".\n\nIn general, Canadian dollar banknotes issued by the Bank of Canada and coins issued under the authority of the Royal Canadian Mint Act are legal tender in Canada. However, commercial transactions may legally be settled in any manner agreed by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, convenience stores may refuse $100 bank notes if they feel that would put them at risk of being counterfeit victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.\n\nAs outlined in the Currency Act, there is a limit to the value of a transaction for which one may use only coins. A payment in coins is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:\n\n\nIn the case of coins of a denomination greater than ten dollars, a payment is a legal tender for no more than the value of a single coin of that denomination. Where more than one amount is payable by one person to another on the same day under one or more obligations, the total of those amounts is deemed to be one amount due and payable on that day.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, the official currency renminbi serves as the unlimited legal tender for all transactions. It is by law that any public institution or individual must not refuse using the currency to settle public or private domestic owing.\n\nEuro coins and banknotes became legal tender in most countries of the Eurozone on 1 January 2002. Although one side of the coins is used for different national marks for each country, all coins and all banknotes are legal tender throughout the eurozone. Therefore, it is possible to find Irish euro coins in Greece and Finnish euro coins in Portugal, for instance. Although some eurozone countries do not put 1 cent and 2 cent coins into general circulation (prices in those countries are by general understanding always rounded to whole multiples of 5 cent), 1 cent and 2 cent coins from other eurozone countries remain legal tender in those countries.\n\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 974/98 limits the number of coins that can be offered for payment to fifty. Governments that issue the coins must establish the euro as the only legal tender. Due to variations on the legislative meaning of legal tender in various member states and the ability of contract law to overrule the status of legal tender, it is possible for merchants to choose to refuse to accept euro banknotes and coins within specific countries within the Eurozone (the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Ireland). National laws may also impose restrictions as to maximal amounts that can be settled by coins or notes.\n\nLegal tender was enacted the first time for gold and silver coins in the French Penal Code of 1807 (art. 475, 11°). In 1870, legal tender was extended to all notes of the Banque de France. Anyone refusing such monies for their whole value would be prosecuted (French Penal Code art. R. 642-3).\n\nAccording to the \"Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998\" of the Republic of Ireland which replaced the legal tender provisions that had been re-enacted in Irish legislation from previous British enactments, \"No person, other than the Central Bank of Ireland and such persons as may be designated by the Minister by order, shall be obliged to accept more than 50 coins denominated in euro or in cent in any single transaction.\"\n\nThe \"Decimal Currency Act, 1970\" governed legal tender prior to the adoption of the euro and laid down the analogous provisions as in United Kingdom legislation (all inherited from previous British law), namely: coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 10 pounds, coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 5 pounds, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence.\n\nThe Indian rupee is the \"de facto\" legal tender currency in India. The Indian rupee is also legal tender in Nepal and Bhutan, but the Nepalese rupee and Bhutanese ngultrum are not legal tender in India. Both the Nepalese rupee and Bhutanese ngultrum are pegged with the Indian rupee.\n\nThe Indian rupee used to be an official currency of other countries, including the Straits Settlements (now Singapore and parts of Malaysia), Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Trucial States (now the UAE).\n\nIn 1837, the Indian rupee was made the sole official currency of the Straits Settlements, as it was administered as a part of India. In 1845, the British replaced the Indian rupee with the Straits dollar after administration of the Straits Settlements separated from India earlier in that same year.\nAfter partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Pakistani rupee came into existence, initially using Indian coins and Indian currency notes simply overstamped with the word \"Pakistan\". New coins and banknotes were issued in 1948.\n\nThe Gulf rupee, also known as the Persian Gulf rupee (XPGR), was introduced by the Government of India as a replacement for the Indian rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India Amendment Act of 1 May 1959. This creation of a separate currency was an attempt to reduce the strain put on India's foreign reserves by gold smuggling.\n\nTwo states, Kuwait and Bahrain eventually replaced the Gulf rupee with their own currencies (the Kuwaiti dinar and the Bahraini dinar) after gaining independence from Britain in 1961 and 1965, respectively.\n\nOn 6 June 1966, India devalued the rupee. To avoid following this devaluation, several of the states using the rupee adopted their own currencies. Qatar and most of the Trucial States adopted the Qatar and Dubai riyal, whilst Abu Dhabi adopted the Bahraini dinar. Only Oman continued to use the Gulf rupee until 1970, with the government backing the currency at its old peg to the pound. Oman later replaced the Gulf rupee with its own rial in 1970.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that existing INR 500 and INR 1000 banknotes would no longer be accepted as legal tender with a view to curb counterfeiting, tax evasion and the parallel economy. The Reserve Bank of India outlined a scheme for holders of such banknotes to either deposit them into their bank accounts for full, unlimited value, or to exchange the banknotes for new, subject to a cap.\n\nNew Zealand has a complex history of legal tender. English law applied, as applicable to local circumstances, from either 6 January 1840, when the Governor of New South Wales by proclamation annexed New Zealand, or from 14 January 1840 when Captain Hobson Royal Navy was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor. The English Laws Act 1858 subsequently confirmed that English legislation passed prior to 14 January 1840 was and had been the law of New Zealand, as applicable to local circumstances. \nThe (UK) Coinage Act 1816 therefore applied and British coins were confirmed as legal tender in New Zealand. Unusually, until 1989, the Reserve Bank did not have the right to issue coins as legal tender. Coins had to be issued by the Minister of Finance.\n\nThe history of bank notes was considerably more complex. In 1840, the Union Bank of Australia started issuing bank notes under provisions of British law, but these were not automatically legal tender.\n\nIn 1844, ordinances were passed making the Union Bank banknotes legal tender and authorising the government to issue debentures in small denominations, thus creating two sets of legal tender. These debentures were circulated but were traded at a discount to their face value because of distrust of the colonial government by the settler population. In 1845, the Ordinance was disallowed by the British Colonial office and they were recalled, not without first causing a panic among holders of the debentures.\n\nIn 1847, the Colonial Bank of Issue became the only issuer of legal tender. In 1856, however the Colonial Bank of Issue was disbanded and through the Paper Currency Act 1856, the Union Bank was confirmed once again as an issuer of legal tender. The Act also authorised the Oriental Bank to issue legal tender but this bank ceased operations in 1861.\n\nBetween 1861 and 1874, a number of other banks including the Bank of New Zealand, Bank of New South Wales, National Bank of New Zealand and Colonial Bank of New Zealand were created by Acts of Parliament and authorised to issue bank notes backed by gold, however these notes were not legal tender.\n\nThe 1893 Bank Note Issue Act allowed the government to declare a bank's right to issue legal tender. This enabled the government to make such a declaration to assist the Bank of New Zealand when in 1895 the bank encountered financial difficulties that could have led to its failure.\n\nIn 1914, the Banking Amendment Act gave legal tender status to bank notes from any issuer and removed the requirement that banks authorised to issue bank notes must redeem them on demand for gold (the gold standard).\n\nIn 1933, the Coinage Act created a specific New Zealand coinage and removed legal tender status from British coins. In the same year the Reserve Bank of New Zealand was established. The bank was given a monopoly on the issue of legal tender. The Reserve Bank also provided a mechanism through which the other issuers of legal tender could phase out their bank notes. These banknotes were convertible into British legal tender on demand at the Reserve Bank and remained so until the 1938 Sterling Exchange Suspension Notice that suspended provisions of a 1936 amendment of the 1933 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act.\n\nIn 1964, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act restated that only notes issued by the Reserve Bank were legal tender. The Act also ended the right of individuals to redeem their bank notes for coin, effectively ending the distinction between coin and notes in New Zealand. The Act came into force in 1967 establishing as legal tender all New Zealand dollar five dollars banknotes and greater, all decimal coins, the pre-decimal sixpence, the shilling, and the florin. Also passed in 1964 was the Decimal Currency Act, which created the basis for a decimal currency, introduced in 1967.\n\nAs of 2005, banknotes were legal tender for all payments, and $1 and $2 coins were legal tender for payments up to $100, and 10c, 20c, and 50c silver coins were legal tender for payments up to $5. These older style silver coins were legal tender until October 2006, after which only the new 10c, 20c and 50c coins, introduced in August 2006, are legal.\n\nThe Norwegian krone (NOK) is legal tender in Norway according to the Central Bank () of 24 May 1985. However, no-one is obliged to accept more than 25 coins of each denomination (of which currently 1, 5, 10 and 20 NOK denominations are in common circulation).\n\nSingapore and Brunei have a Currency Interchangeability Agreement since 12 June 1967. Under the agreement, Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar are exchangeable at par without charge in both countries. As such, the currency of one country is accepted in the other country as \"customary tender\".\n\nThe Swiss franc is the only legal tender in Switzerland. Any payment consisting of up to 100 Swiss coins is legal tender; banknotes are legal tender for any amount.\n\nThe sixth series of Swiss bank notes from 1976, recalled by the National Bank in 2000, is no longer legal tender, but can be exchanged in banks for current notes until April 2020.\n\nThe Swiss franc is also the legal tender of the Principality of Liechtenstein, which is joined to Switzerland in a customs union.\n\nThe Swiss franc is also the currency used for administrative and accounting purposes by most of the numerous international organisations that are headquartered in Switzerland.\n\nThe New Taiwan dollar issued by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is legal tender for all payments within the territory of the Republic of China, Taiwan. However, since 2007, candidates to become civil servants in elections in the Republic of China may no longer pay any deposit in coinage.\n\nSeries 2 banknotes first issued in 1925 during the reign of Rama VI and continuing into the reign of Rama VII added the legend, \n\"Promise to pay\" (silver to) \"bearer on demand in\" (silver) \"currency of Siam\";\n\n\"This note is legal tender \" (literal translation, \"silver in payment of debt\") \"according to law\".\n\nLegal tender is solely for the guaranteed settlement of debts and does not affect any party's right of refusal of service in any transaction.\n\nIn the 19th century, gold coins were legal tender to any amount, but silver coins were not legal tender for sums over 2 pounds nor bronze for sums over 1 shilling. This provision was retained in revised form at the introduction of decimal currency, and the Coinage Act 1971 laid down that coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 10 pounds, non-bronze coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 5 pounds, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence.\n\nThroughout the United Kingdom, coins valued 1 pound, 2 pounds, and 5 pounds Sterling are legal tender in unlimited amounts. Twenty pence pieces and fifty pence pieces are legal tender in amounts up to 10 pounds; five pence pieces and ten pence pieces are legal tender in amounts up to 5 pounds; and pennies and two pence coins are legal tender in amounts up to 20 pence. In accordance with the Coinage Act 1971, gold sovereigns are also legal tender for any amount. Although it is not specifically mentioned on them, the face values of gold coins are 50p; £1; £2; and £5, a mere fraction of their worth as bullion. Five pound coins, although legal tender, are intended as souvenirs and are almost never seen in circulation.\n\nMaundy money is legal tender but may not be accepted by retailers and is worth much more than face value due to its rarity value and silver content.\n\nBank of England notes are legal tender in England and Wales and are issued in the denominations of £5, £10, £20 and £50. They can always be redeemed at the Bank of England even if discontinued. Banknotes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks are not legal tender anywhere but are widely accepted with agreement between parties. Thus legal tender in Scotland is limited to coin.\n\nIn a 1976 case, Miliangos v George Frank Ltd, the House of Lords established that the English courts could order debts to be paid in currencies other than the pound sterling under certain circumstances, overturning two centuries of precedent.\n\nBefore the Civil War (1861 to 1865), silver coins were legal tender only up to the sum of $5. Before 1853, when U.S. silver coins were reduced in weight 7%, coins had exactly their value in metal (from 1830 to 1852). Two silver 50 cent coins had exactly $1 worth of silver. A gold U.S. dollar of 1849 had $1 worth of gold. With the flood of gold coming out of the California mines in the early 1850s, the price of silver rose (gold went down). Thus, 50 cent coins of 1840 to 1852 were worth 53 cents if melted down. The government could increase the value of the gold coins (expensive) or reduce the size of all U.S. silver coins. With the reduction of 1853, a 50-cent coin now had only 48 cents of silver. This is the reason for the $5 limit of silver coins as legal tender; paying somebody $100 in the new silver coins would be giving them $96 worth of silver. Most people preferred bank check or gold coins for large purchases.\n\nDuring the early American Civil War, the federal government first issued United States Notes (the first greenback notes), which were not redeemable in gold and silver coins but could be used to pay \"all dues\" to the federal government. Since land purchases and duties on imports were payable only in gold or the new Demand Notes, the Demand Notes were bought by importers and land speculators for about 97 cents on the gold dollar and never lost value. 1862 greenbacks (Legal Tender Notes) at first traded for 97 cents on the dollar but gained/lost value depending on fortunes of the Union army. The value of Legal Tender Greenbacks swung wildly but trading was from 85 to 33 cents on the gold dollar.\n\nThis resulted in a situation in which the greenback \"Legal Tender\" notes of 1862 were fiat, and so gold and silver were held and paper circulated at a discount because of Gresham's Law. The 1861 Demand Notes were a huge success but robbed the customs house of much needed gold coin (interest on most bonds back then was paid in gold). A money-strapped Congress, which had to pay for the war, eventually adopted the Legal Tender Act of 1862, issuing United States Notes backed only by treasury securities, and compelled the people to accept the new notes at a discount; prices rose except for those who had gold and/or silver coins.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, paper currency was disputed as to if it must be accepted as payment. In 1869, Hepburn v. Griswold found that Henry Griswold would not have to accept paper currency because it could not truly be \"legal tender\" and was unconstitutional as a legally enforceable means to pay debts. This led to the Legal Tender Cases in 1870, which overturned the previous ruling and established the paper currency as constitutional and proper legal tender that must be accepted in all situations.\n\nWith the 1884 Supreme Court ruling in \"Juilliard v. Greenman\", the \"Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the right to issue notes to be legal tender for the payment of public and private debt. Legal-tender notes are treasury notes or banknotes that, in the eyes of the law, must be accepted in the payment of debts.\" The ruling in the Legal Tender Cases (which include \"Juilliard v. Greenman\") led later courts to \"support the federal government's invalidation of gold clauses in private contracts in the 1930s.\"\n\nOn the other hand, coins made of gold or silver may not necessarily be legal tender, if they are not fiat money in the jurisdiction where they are proffered as payment. The Coinage Act of 1965 states (in part):\n\nContrary to common misconception, there is no federal law stating that a private business, a person, or a government organization must accept currency or coins for payment. Private businesses are free to create their own policies on whether or not they accept cash, unless there is a specific state law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in cents or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores, and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency as a matter of policy or safety.\n\nThe principal purpose of that statute is to ensure the nationwide acceptance of U.S. currency, consistent with constitutional language that reserves to Congress the power to create a uniform currency that holds the same value throughout the United States. While the statute provides that U.S. money is legal tender that may be accepted for the payment of debts, it does not require \"acceptance\" of cash payments, nor does it provide that restrictions cannot be imposed upon the acceptance of cash.\n\nOn 11 December 2016, the Venezuelan Government announced demonetisation following almost 500% inflation in the country. People of the country were given 3 days to get rid of the 100 Bolivar notes (most widely used currency) post the introduction of new note of higher denominations. As of 15 June 2017, there has been 7 extensions (one per month) of the legal use of the 100 bolivares bill notes. The 100 Bolivar notes are still legal tender up today 30 December 2017.\nMaduro prorrogó la vigencia del billete de 100 hasta el 20 de abril\n\n\n"}

He was shot and killed during the Ludlow Massacre, the bloodiest event of the strike, on April 20, 1914.\n\nTikas was born in Crete in 1886.\nIn 1910, the year Louis Tikas filed his citizenship papers in the United States, he was part owner of a Greek coffee house on Market Street in Denver. By the end of 1912 he was an organizer for the United Mine Workers of America. In between he worked as a miner-strikebreaker in Colorado’s Northern (Coal) Field but ended up leading a walkout by sixty-three fellow Greeks at the Frederick, Colorado mine. Tikas was chased from the northern field, shot and wounded by Baldwin-Felts detectives as he escaped through the back door of a boarding house in Lafayette, Colorado in January 1910.\n\nHe was shot and killed during the Ludlow Massacre, the bloodiest event of the strike, on April 20, 1914, the day after (Greek Orthodox) Easter. 19 people were killed during the massacre including 2 women and 11 children and one National Guardsman.\n\nTikas met with Major Pat Hamrock on the day of the massacre in response to allegations of a man being held against his will in the camp. The militia placed machine guns on the hills and Tikas, anticipating trouble, ran back to camp. But fighting broke out lasting all day. By 7:00 pm, the camp was aflame. Tikas remained in the camp the entire day and was there when the fire started. Lieutenant Karl Linderfelt, a rival of Tikas' during much of the strike, broke the butt of his gun over Tikas' head. Tikas was later found shot to death, one bullet through his back, another in his hip, a third glancing off his hip and traveling vertically through his body; it was determined that he bled to death. The film \"Palikari\" honours his death.\n\nA statue of Louis Tikas was dedicated at the Miner's Memorial on Mani Street in Trinidad, Colorado on June 23, 2018.\n\nOn April 20, 1914, while the militia officer in charge of Company B and Tikas were meeting, a number of Company B troopers — as instructed by superiors — located themselves atop Water Tank Hill, just south of Ludlow. Many colonists spotted the militiamen, and, being quite concerned, armed themselves and moved to key points where they could closely watch activities atop the small hill. Other colonists feared something was awry and scurried about for cover. Suddenly the sound of rifle fire echoed through the nearby hills. Neither the militia nor the colonists knew who fired these shots, but an exchange of gunfire began, as both confused colonists and militiamen believed they were coming under attack.\n\nThe militia were badly outnumbered by the colonists, but had certain advantages, including a choice location and a machine gun. The spray from the gun drove armed strikers back toward the tents, and provided excellent coverage for guardsmen advancing toward the tents. Meanwhile, Company A reinforcements arrived with another machine gun to offer support to Company B. The colonists now faced two automatic weapons and about 150 guardsmen. Machine gun and rifle fire forced women and children colonists to take refuge in storage cellars beneath the tents. This offered some protection but advancing guardsmen eventually forced the cellars' occupants to abandon the underground shelters and to evacuate to the east of the colony site to some hills locally called the \"Black Hills\" for protection. By late afternoon, it was clear that the militia would overrun the colony site, and everyone would have to abandon the site and join those who had already fled to the Black Hills. Meanwhile, a deserted tent burst into flames and, within a short time, more tents began to burn. At the same time, the militiamen overran and took command of the colony site.\n\nBy early morning, April 21, 1914, the colony site — previously covered by hundreds of tents — revealed nothing more than charred rubble remains of the tents. The bodies of two women and 11 children- victims of asphyxiation- were found huddled within a cellar. Five strikers, 2 other youngsters, and at least 4 men associated with the militia also died. Though the Ludlow battle ended on the night of April 20, 1914, sporadic violence continued for days after. Battles that took place at various coal camps claimed many more lives. In late April, federal troops moved into southern Colorado, almost immediately restoring peace. The strike, however, continued through early December, finally coming to an end without resolution. Despite the heavy loss of lives and property, the strikers' efforts and losses weren't entirely in vain. The effects of the strike and the violence encouraged state and federal lawmakers to pass legislation that, in the long run, would help hasten improvements in conditions for working miners. Because of this, a remote southern Colorado prairie at Ludlow will always be deeply etched in the annals of coal mining history.\n\nA memorial is located at Ludlow and the map above shows the mining communities involved in the infamous tragedy.\n\n\n"}

The book continues the idea of \"stickiness\" popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in \"The Tipping Point\", seeking to explain what makes an idea or concept memorable or interesting. A similar style to Gladwell's is used, with a number of stories and case studies followed by principles.\n\nThe stories range from urban legends, such as the \"Kidney Heist\" in the introduction; to business stories, as with the story of Southwest Airlines, \"the low price airline\"; to inspirational, personal stories such as that of Floyd Lee, a passionate mess hall manager. Each chapter includes a section entitled \"Clinic\", in which the principles of the chapter are applied to a specific case study or idea to demonstrate the principle's application.\n\nThe book's outline follows the acronym \"SUCCES\" (with the last \"s\" omitted). Each letter refers to a characteristic that can help make an idea \"sticky\":\n\nThe book then goes to mention examples like:\nSimple: Southwest Airlines, whose motto is \"THE low fare airline\". If a steward proposed serving chicken salad in the Texas–Vegas route, thinking about that motto helps one decide that this is not a good idea. Other example: Proverbs, which encapsulate wisdom in short sentences. The book mentions many case studies of successful teachers and professionals around the world such as Diana Virgo of Loudoun Academy of Science as a mathematics teacher.\n\nChip Heath is a professor of organizational behavior at Graduate School of Business at Stanford University. Dan Heath, a former researcher at Harvard, is a consultant and developer of innovative textbooks. They also write a regular feature for \"Fast Company\" magazine.\n\nThe book was commercially successful, appearing on the \"New York Times\" and \"Wall Street Journal\" bestseller lists, alongside a 24-month listing on \"BusinessWeek\" book listings.\n\nWriting in \"The Guardian\", William Leith described it as a \"smart, lively book\" that is \"fun to read\" and will give readers \"an insight into the power of bad ideas\" as well as better ones. In her review in the \"Stanford Social Innovation Review\", Judith Samuelson observed that \"The Heath brothers have taught me that if anyone is going to 'get' my idea – need it, buy it, fund it, use it – I need to radically shorten my elevator pitch. Writing in \"BookPages\", Eliza McGraw wrote, \"How do we make people care about our ideas?, the Heaths ask. We appeal to their self-interest, but we also appeal to their identities not only to the people they are right now but also to the people they would like to be.\"\n\n\n"}

It repudiates mainstream psychology and psychiatry as humanistic, fundamentally opposed to Christianity, and radically secular. Its viewpoint was originally articulated by Jay E. Adams, in \"Competent to Counsel\" (1970) and further books, and has led to the formation of a number of organizations and seminary courses promoting it. The viewpoint is opposed to those seeking to synthesize Christianity with secular psychological thought, but has failed to win them over to a purely Biblical approach. Since 1993, the movement has renamed itself Biblical counseling to emphasize its central emphasis on the Bible. The \"Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology and Counseling\" states that \"The aim of Nouthetic Counseling is to effect change in the counselee by encouraging greater conformity to the principles of Scripture.\"\n\nNouthetic counseling has been criticized as narrowly conceived, with a confrontational focus upon sin and behavior, which fails to deal adequately with emotion, grief, and suffering, and which lacks understanding of complex human motivations.\n\nClinton and Ohlschlager describe what they call the historic debate between nouthetic counselors and integrationists. Nouthetic counselors, they say, argue that truth can only be known as revealed in the Scriptures. According to an article published by the Spring Christian Counseling Center, secular counseling and psychology are primarily pseudosciences which only can be transformed into \"true\" sciences within the framework of faith-based Christian dialog. Integrationists argue that God reveals his truth universally. This includes general revelation, or what they define as truth known by scientific investigation, as well as truth known by special revelation in Christ. Clinton and Ohlschlager express their belief that \"shrill criticism and rancorous debate\" are ill-suited to the mission of uplifting Christ as the model for counseling.\n\nChristian counselor and psychologist, and leading proponent of the rival \"community model\", Larry Crabb, states that Adams compares behavior patterns \"with his understanding of biblical behavior patterns, and commands change\". Crabb agrees with Adams that obedience to God's commands is \"absolutely necessary for effective Christian living\", but takes issue with what he sees as Adams' apparent belief that this is the \"single key ingredient for spiritual growth\". Crabb believes that this neglects what he refers to as the \"'insides' of the behaving person\", particularly \"the person's assumption system and his evaluation of situations based on his assumptions\".\n\nChristians also debate the causes of mental illness and the extent of demonic influence on counselees. Three different views as to the origin of mental illness emphasize respectively:\n\n\nFurthermore, \"[i]n the counseling field, many nouthetic counselors have said that Satan and his demons were bound, bruised, curtailed and restrained at the time of Christ's death and resurrection. They assert that human beings today primarily struggle with their own sin natures rather than directly with Satan and his emissaries.\"\n\nEric Johnson points out that nouthetic counseling has tended to be \"very skeptical of contemporary psychology\" and \"the efforts of integrationist Christians who seek to combine their faith with that psychology.\" On page 800, The Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology and Counseling describes Nouthetic Counselors as \"zealous to return God and the Bible to positions of authority in the hearts and lives of people\", but criticises them as “failing to see the validity in alternative approaches.” Donn Arms, a Nouthetic Counselor and associate of Jay E. Adams wrote a response to the Encyclopedia's criticism.\n\nNouthetic counseling has been criticized for the way its \"rational and certain approach can come across as impersonal, emotionally distant, and insensitive.\"\n\nNouthetic counseling is viewed as highly controversial by secular psychologists who believe that it is unethical to counsel that the Bible has the answers for all people of all backgrounds.\n\nSome counselors believe that nouthetic counseling can do considerable harm to patients. In addition to techniques which critics consider ineffective, patients who are not helped by nouthetic counseling often consider themselves to be \"unfaithful\" or religious failures.\n\n\n\n"}

Wilhelm Ostwald developed the process, and he patented it in 1902. The Ostwald process is a mainstay of the modern chemical industry, and it provides the main raw material for the most common type of fertilizer production. Historically and practically, the Ostwald process is closely associated with the Haber process, which provides the requisite raw material, ammonia (NH).\n\nAmmonia is converted to nitric acid in 2 stages. It is oxidized by heating with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum with 10% rhodium, to form nitric oxide /nitrogen(ii)oxide and water/steam. This reaction is strongly exothermic, making it a useful heat source once initiated:\n\nStage two encompasses two reactions and is carried out in an absorption apparatus containing water. Initially nitric oxide is oxidized again to yield nitrogen dioxide/nitrogen(iv)oxide.

J.\" Kennedy (January 14, 1858 – May 18, 1929) was an American businessman and politician. Kennedy was a major figure in the Democratic Party in Boston. He was the father of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and the paternal grandfather of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy was the only surviving male in the family after two outbreaks of cholera killed his father and brother. He started work at fourteen as a stevedore in the docks. Kennedy owned three saloons and a whisky import house, and eventually had major interests in coal and banking. He moved successfully into politics, as a sociable man able to mix comfortably with both the Catholic and the Protestant elite, and he sat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and in the Massachusetts Senate. His particular talent was for the behind-the-scenes machinations for which Boston politics became so notorious.\n\nKennedy was the youngest of five children born to Irish Catholic immigrants Patrick Kennedy (1823–1858) and Bridget Murphy (1824–1888), who were both from New Ross, County Wexford, and married in Boston on September 26, 1849. The couple's elder son, John, had died of cholera in infancy two years before Kennedy was born. Ten months after Kennedy's birth, his father Patrick also succumbed to the infectious cholera epidemic that infested the family's East Boston neighborhood. As the only surviving male, Kennedy was the first family member to receive a formal education. His mother Bridget had purchased an East Boston stationery and notions store where she had worked. The business took off and expanded into a grocery and liquor store.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Kennedy left school to work with his mother and three older sisters, Mary, Joanna, and Margaret, as a stevedore on the Boston Docks. In the 1880s, with money he had saved from his modest earnings, he launched a business career by buying a saloon in Haymarket Square downtown. In time, he bought a second establishment by the East Boston docks. Next, to capitalize on the social drinking of upper-class Boston, Kennedy purchased a third bar in an upscale East Boston hotel, the Maverick House. Before he was thirty, his growing prosperity allowed him to buy a whiskey-importing business.\n\nBy the time of his death in 1929, Kennedy held an interest in a coal company and a substantial amount of stock in a bank, the Columbia Trust Company. His wealth afforded his family of one son and two daughters an attractive home on Jeffries Point in East Boston.\n\nKennedy was \"always ready to help less fortunate fellow Irishmen with a little cash and some sensible advice.\" He enjoyed the approval and respect of most folks in East Boston, living on the hill of a mixed Boston neighborhood of upscale Irish and Protestant elite. Beginning in 1884, he converted his popularity into five consecutive one-year terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, followed by three two-year terms in the Massachusetts Senate. Establishing himself as one of Boston's principal Democratic leaders, he was invited to give one of the seconding speeches for Grover Cleveland at the party's 1888 national convention in St. Louis. However, he found campaigning, speech making, and legislative maneuvering, to be less appealing than the behind-the-scenes machinations that characterized so much of Boston politics in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. After leaving the Senate in 1895, Kennedy spent his political career as an appointed elections commissioner, an appointed fire commissioner, as the backroom boss of Boston's Ward Two, and as a member of his party's unofficial Board of Strategy.\n\nOn November 23, 1887, Kennedy married Mary Augusta Hickey (December 6, 1857 – May 6, 1923), daughter of James Hickey and Margaret Martha Field. The couple had four children and remained married until Hickey’s death in May 1923.\nTed Kennedy, youngest son of Joseph, named his younger son Patrick (born 1967) to honor P. J. Kennedy.\n\nIn his later years, Kennedy developed degenerative liver disease. In April 1929, he was admitted to Deaconess Hospital to receive treatment. He died there on May 18 at the age of 71. His funeral was held at St. John the Evangelist Church in Winthrop, Massachusetts on May 21. The \"Boston Globe\" reported that hundreds of mourners lined the streets to watch Kennedy’s funeral procession and businesses in East Boston closed to honor him. Kennedy is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1914, P.J. Kennedy's son Joseph married Rose Fitzgerald (1890–1995), the eldest daughter of Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald (1863–1950). Joe and Rose had nine children, including World War II casualty Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. (1915–1944), President John F. Kennedy (1917–1963), Senator Robert F. Kennedy (1925–1968), and longtime Senator Ted Kennedy (1932–2009).\n\nThe Patrick J. Kennedy School, named for him, is a public grammar school located in East Boston.\n"}

She began her career playing supporting roles in several independent films, including the coming-of-age drama film \"Tanner Hall\" (2009), before starring as Nancy Holbrook in the 2010 remake of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and as Erica Albright in the biographical drama film \"The Social Network\" (2010).\n\nIn 2011, Mara had a career breakthrough when she portrayed Lisbeth Salander, the title character in David Fincher's \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", based on Stieg Larsson's \"Millennium\" book series. She received critical acclaim for her performance and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. In 2013, she starred in the thriller \"Side Effects\", the independent drama \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints\", and the acclaimed sci-fi romantic drama \"Her\". The following year, she starred in the adventure drama film \"Trash\" (2014). In 2015, she garnered further critical acclaim for her performance in Todd Haynes' romantic drama \"Carol\", for which she tied for the Best Actress Award at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, and received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, SAG Award, BAFTA Award and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nMara is also known for her charity work and oversees the charity Uweza Foundation, which supports empowerment programs for children and families in the Kibera slum of Nairobi, Kenya, one of the largest slums in Africa.\n\nMara was born and raised in Bedford, New York, a town in Westchester County about 40 miles north of New York City. Mara's mother's family (the Rooneys) founded the Pittsburgh Steelers and her father's family (the Maras) founded the New York Giants. Her father, Timothy Christopher Mara, is the vice president of player evaluation for the New York Giants, and her mother, Kathleen McNulty (née Rooney), a part-time real estate agent. She is the third of four children: she has an older brother, Daniel, an older sister, Kate, who is also an actress, and a younger brother, Conor.\n\nMara's father has Irish, German and French-Canadian ancestry, and her mother is of Irish and Italian descent. Her Rooney ancestors originated in Newry, County Down. Her paternal grandparents were Wellington Mara and Ann Mara. Wellington was the long-time co-owner of the Giants, who was succeeded in that position by his son (Rooney Mara's uncle), John Mara. Rooney Mara's maternal grandfather, Timothy James \"Tim\" Rooney, has run Yonkers Raceway in Yonkers, New York since 1972. Mara is the great-granddaughter of both New York Giants founder Tim Mara and Pittsburgh Steelers founder Art Rooney, Sr., as well as of Kathleen McNulty Rooney. Her granduncle, Dan Rooney, was chairman of the Steelers, the former United States Ambassador to Ireland, the co-founder of The Ireland Funds charitable organization, and the architect of American Football's Rooney Rule. U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney from Florida is her first cousin, once removed.\n\nAfter graduating from Fox Lane High School in 2003, she went to Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia in South America for four months as part of the Traveling School, an open learning environment. She attended George Washington University for a year and then transferred to New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where she studied psychology, international social policy and nonprofits, graduating in 2010.\n\nMara was inspired to act by seeing musical theatre and classic movies, like \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), \"Rebecca\" (1940), and \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), with her mother. She also wanted to be like her sister, Kate Mara, a professional actress. Mara resisted pursuing acting as a child, stating to \"The Journal News\" that \"it never seemed that honorable to me, and I guess I was always afraid that I might fail.\" Her first and only role in high school was Juliet in \"Romeo and Juliet\", which she got after being signed up to audition by a friend. Mara acted in a few student films while at NYU, and then began her career in acting, first auditioning at the age of nineteen.\n\nMara first appeared as an extra in films which starred her sister, including a bit-part in the 2005 direct-to-video horror film \"\". She found work in television, making her professional debut in a 2006 episode of the drama \"\", as a girl who bullies overweight children. She guest-starred on the legal drama \"Women's Murder Club\" and played a drug addict in an episode of \"The Cleaner\". Mara made her feature film debut \"Dream Boy\" (2008) and guest-starred as Megan for two episodes of NBC's \"ER\".\n\nIn a coming-of-age film \"Tanner Hall\" (2009), Mara landed her first lead role, as Fernanda who has an affair with a married family friend (Tom Everett Scott). The film was the directorial debut of Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg and Francesca Gregorini, it debuted at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release in September 2011. Mara dropped her first name 'Patricia', to be known professionally by her middle name after working on the project. \"I never really liked my first name,\" Mara stated to \"Paper\" magazine. \"I never felt like a Tricia. And Rooney is more memorable\". Her father and younger brother also go by their middle names.\n\nIn Miguel Arteta's comedy-drama film \"Youth in Revolt\", Mara played Taggarty who tries to sleep with fifty men before she goes to college. The film was based on C.D. Payne's 1993 cult novel of the same name. Mara had auditioned for the starring role, but was offered the smaller part when the lead went to Portia Doubleday.\n\nMara played Courtney in the 2009 independent film, \"Dare\" and in \"The Winning Season\" as Wendy, a high school basketball player having an affair with a middle-aged shoe salesman (Kevin Breznahan) with a similar story to \"The Bad News Bears\". Both films were premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and Mara was included on \"Filmmaker\" magazine's list of \"25 New Faces of Independent Film\" that year.\n\nMara starred in a remake of the 1984 horror film \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", as the protagonist Nancy Holbrook, a high school student victimized by Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley). Mara began shooting the film in Chicago on May 5, 2009, directed by Samuel Bayer. Mara told \"Filmmaker\" that she felt that her Nancy was \"completely different from the original\" and \"the loneliest girl in the world\". Mara had signed on to continue her role if a sequel was made. She stated to \"Vogue\" that she disliked the experience of making the film so much, that it made her question if she wanted to be an actress. Mara appeared at the Hamptons International Film Festival in October 2009 as part of its Breakthrough Performers Program, where she was tutored by Sharon Stone.\n\nIn David Fincher's biopic drama film \"The Social Network\", she played Erica Albright, who breaks up with Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook.\n\nIn August 2010, Mara was cast as the lead in a film adaptation of the \"Millennium\" book trilogy by Stieg Larsson. She played Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but troubled computer hacker who helps journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) solve a series of murders. Mara won the role over several other actresses after two and a half months of auditions and screen tests. David Fincher directed the first film, based on the novel \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", with Scott Rudin producing. The other books, \"The Girl Who Played with Fire\", and \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\", may be adapted, depending on box office performance. Fincher initially did not picture her as the character but changed his mind when she auditioned. He convinced executives at Columbia Pictures to cast her for the part.\n\n\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" began shooting in Sweden in September 2010. Mara did not consider the film to be a remake, but another interpretation of the novel. \"I plan on giving my interpretation of the character,\" she stated to \"Variety\". Mara's long brown hair was cut short and dyed black, in a style reminiscent of 1970s punk and 1980s goth fashions. She also had each of her ears pierced four times, and had her brow and right nipple pierced for the role. Her nose and lip piercings were fake. She kept the nipple piercing so that it would not need to be re-pierced for a sequel. Mara's eyebrows were bleached, and she wore a temporary dragon tattoo. She began preparing for the role by starting to skateboard and kickbox, and underwent dialect and computer training. She also visited Stockholm, the setting of the novel. The film was released on December 20, 2011. Mara received universal critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance. On January 24, 2012, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.\n\nIn late 2011, Mara was considered for Kathryn Bigelow's action film \"Zero Dark Thirty\", but the role went to Jessica Chastain. Mara replaced Carey Mulligan in Spike Jonze's film, \"Her\" (2013). \"Variety\" reported that Mulligan had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, and Mara was selected to fill in alongside Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nMara starred in Steven Soderbergh's 2013 crime-thriller film \"Side Effects\", replacing Blake Lively. The film also starred Jude Law, Channing Tatum, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vinessa Shaw. She played Emily Taylor, \"a woman who turns to prescription medication as a way of handling her anxiety concerning her husband's upcoming release from prison.\" That same year, she starred in David Lowery's 2013 independent film \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints\" which is described as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde story, alongside Casey Affleck and Ben Foster. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2013 where IFC Films purchased the rights for U.S. distribution. In May 2013, she became the new face of Calvin Klein new fragrance Down Town.\n\nIn 2014, Mara served as the costume designer on her former boyfriend Charlie McDowell's film \"The One I Love\", credited as Bree Daniel.\n\nIn 2015, Mara played Tiger Lily in the Joe Wright-directed fantasy film \"Pan\", a role which she received a great deal of criticism for taking. She and Wright faced accusations of \"whitewashing\" a role originally written for a Native American and of \"Redface.\" To express their concerns, Native American activists created a hashtag #NotYourTigerlily to protest Mara's casting and thousands of Native Americans participated in a \"Twitterstorm\" to share memes addressing their concerns about the portrayal of Native women in film.\nAt the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, she tied for the Best Actress award for her role in the film \"Carol\". She was also nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a British Academy Film Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance.\n\nIn 2016, Mara voiced \"The Sisters\" in the stop motion animated film \"Kubo and the Two Strings\". She starred alongside Ben Mendelsohn directed by Benedict Andrews in \"Una\" which had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. Mara next starred in \"Lion\" alongside Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman, revolving around an adopted man finding his family using Google Earth and \"The Secret Scripture\", directed by Jim Sheridan.\n\nIn 2017, Mara appeared in \"The Discovery\" directed by Charlie McDowell and \"A Ghost Story\", with Casey Affleck, directed by David Lowery. Both had their world premieres at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2017. Mara starred with Ryan Gosling, Natalie Portman, Cate Blanchett and Val Kilmer in Terrence Malick's \"Song to Song\", which was released in a limited release on March 17, 2017.\n\nIn 2018, Mara appeared in \"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot\", directed by Gus Van Sant, opposite Joaquin Phoenix, Jonah Hill and Jack Black. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2018. and is scheduled to be released on July 13, 2018, by Amazon Studios. That same year, Mara starred opposite Phoenix again in \"Mary Magdalene\", directed by Garth Davis. The film was released in the United Kingdom on March 16, 2018, by Focus Features. It received negative reviews from critics. That same year, Mara and Phoenix narrated the Australian vegan documentary \"Dominion\", directed by Chris Delforce.\n\nMara is attached to co-produce and star as Amanda Lindhout in the screen adaptation of the memoir \"A House in the Sky\", a longtime passion project that Mara expects to begin production in 2018.\n\nIn February 2018, it was announced Mara, Sara Schloat, and Chrys Wong had started a vegan clothing line \"Hireath Collective\", consisting of clothing, shoes, and accessories, designed by the two. The clothing line is produced in Los Angeles, California. The clothing line was made available in select Barneys New York stores and online, beginning in August 2018.\n\nMara founded the charity Faces of Kibera, which aimed to provide housing, food, and medical care for orphans in Kibera, a Nairobi, Kenya slum. The charity's goal was to build an orphanage in the region, for which 6 acres of land have been purchased. The charity auctioned memorabilia from the Steelers and Giants, as well as training camp events on eBay to raise money. She visited the area as a volunteer in 2006 and was moved to help the orphans, many whose parents have died from AIDS and HIV-related illnesses. She began the charity due to her frustration with the growing number of nonprofits that are just business opportunities. \"The people who need help aren’t really getting it. So I started my own\", she told \"Interview\" magazine in 2009. Mara later found it challenging to balance her charity work and acting career. \"I need to do both; I can't just do acting,\" she stated to \"The Journal News\". In January 2011, Faces of Kibera merged with Uweza Foundation which runs community-based empowerment programs in Kibera, including soccer leagues and after-school tutoring. Uweza is a Swahili word meaning opportunity, ability, and power. Mara serves as the president of the board of directors for the foundation.\n\nMara moved to Los Angeles in early 2007 and lived with her sister temporarily. Although they do not live together anymore, Mara felt that the experience brought them closer together, and as of 2010 were regularly discussing the film business and movie scripts. As of January 2012, Mara lived in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. She includes Gena Rowlands among the actresses who inspire her, especially her performances in \"A Woman Under the Influence\" (1974) and \"Opening Night\" (1977). She is a vegan.\n\nFrom 2010 to late 2016, she was in a relationship with American director Charlie McDowell.\n\nSince late 2016, she has been dating actor Joaquin Phoenix. They currently reside in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nMara's mother's family founded the Pittsburgh Steelers, and her father's family founded the New York Giants. The families have maintained at least partial ownership of both teams since their foundings. Mara's father and paternal uncles have high ranking positions within the Giants organization; her uncle John Mara is the president and CEO of the team. Her other uncle, Art Rooney II, is the current owner and president of the Steelers. Mara has described football as \"the glue that holds our family together.\"\n\n"}

His grandfather, Jeremiah Hatfield, was a half-brother to Valentine Hatfield (1789–1867), grandfather of William Anderson \"Devil Anse\" Hatfield, leader of the Hatfield family involved in the famous Hatfield-McCoy Feud (see Hatfield Family Tree). According to the 1900 Census, two older brothers, Orison and Hereford, an older sister Chloe, and a younger sister and brother, Martha Alice and Freeland, were then still living at home with him and their parents. His eldest sister Vandalia or Vandella was already married by this time, and an older brother, Melvin, had left home.\n\nAs a child, Hatfield worked on his father's farm. He became a miner in his teens, and then worked as a blacksmith for several years. He received his nickname, \"Smilin' Sid\", because of the gold caps on several of his upper teeth. He seems to have had a reputation for hard living and fighting, and his appointment in 1919 to the post of Police Chief of Matewan, by the mayor, Cabell Cornelis Testerman (1882–1920), surprised some of the more \"respectable\" townsfolk. However, he was a staunch supporter of the United Mine Workers of America, as was Testerman: together, they were instrumental in leading the mining community's resistance to the Baldwin-Felts operatives. Operatives offered both men substantial bribes to allow them to station machine guns in the town. Hatfield and Testerman refused. The Battle of Matewan was precipitated by the Baldwin-Felts agents' attempts to evict the families of unionized miners.\n\nOn June 2, 1920, in Huntington, he married Jessie Lee Maynard (1894–1976), the widowed second wife of Testerman, who had been mortally wounded in the battle. The speed of the marriage led to an attempt at arrest and accusations by Thomas Felts and the Baldwin-Felts spy, Charles Everett Lively, that he, not Albert Felts, had shot the Mayor because of his desire for Jessie. However, according to Jessie, her first husband, aware of the danger of their situation, had asked that his friend take care of her and their young son, Jackson (1915–2001), should he be killed.\n\nThe battle had given Hatfield a degree of celebrity. He appeared in a short film, \"Smilin' Sid\", for the United Mine Workers (UMWA), and was photographed with other UMWA activists, including Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones. However, he was aware that his life was in danger from Felts, who sought vengeance for his brothers Albert and Lee. He was indicted on murder charges stemming from the Matewan shootout but was later acquitted by the jury. He was sent to stand trial with his friend and deputy, Edward Chambers, on conspiracy charges for another incident, in Welch, West Virginia. \n\nThe conspiracy charges were based on an incident in Mohawk, WV, located in McDowell County near the border of Mingo County. The mining camp of Mohawk was shot up, and according to the local mine guards, the perpetrators were Mingo County strikers led by Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers, intending to force the Mohawk miners to unionize. (p 65, Howard B. Lee, Bloodletting in Appalachia) According to C.E. Lively's secret testimony(leading to Hatfield's indictment), Lively had persuaded miners in his restaurant--as well as Hatfield and Chambers--to do something drastic: he encouraged the miners to arm themselves and shoot up the nonunion tipple at Mohawk. At this location, the mine guards had a reception committee waiting for them, with bloodhounds and machine guns, while Lively made himself busy on the telephone.(When Miner's March, William Blizzard) The union leaders, on the other hand, argued that the shooting was done by McDowell County mine guards, and that they were attempting to falsely accuse Hatfield and Chambers of the offense in order to ambush them in McDowell County. (p 65, Howard B. Lee, Bloodletting in Appalachia)\n\nAt the assurances of McDowell County sheriff Bill Hatfield, Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers were told that they would have the fullest protection of the sheriff's office. The day before the shooting, Sheriff Hatfield left the county for Craig Healing Springs in Virginia. (p 67, Howard B. Lee, Bloodletting in Appalachia)\n\nBoth men arrived in Welch on August 1, 1921, unarmed and accompanied by their wives. Several Baldwin-Felts men shot them on the McDowell County Courthouse steps. Hit in the arm, and three or four times in the chest, Hatfield died instantly. Chambers was shot several more times, as his wife tried to defend him, and finished off with a bullet in the head by Charles Everett Lively. None of the Baldwin-Felts detectives was ever convicted of Hatfield's assassination: they claimed they had acted \"in self-defense.\"\n\nThere was an outpouring of grief for the fallen local heroes at the funeral, which was attended by at least 3,000 people, and conducted with full honors from the Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias and Redmen (he was a member of all of these organizations).\n\nDirector John Sayles' Academy Award-nominated 1987 film \"Matewan\" starred David Strathairn in the role of Hatfield.\n\n\"West Virginia: A Film History\" mistakenly identifies him as Albert Sidney Hatfield, as well as claiming that he was not related to \"Devil Anse\" Hatfield. This may be because of rumours that he was illegitimate, and so possibly not of Hatfield descent.\n\n\n\n"}

Startup Weekend has grown into an organization with a global presence. As of December 2016, Startup Weekend has reached 135 countries, involving over 210,000 entrepreneurs. Startup Weekend is one of the Techstars Startup Programs, alongside Startup Week and Startup Digest.\n\nFounded in July 2007 in Boulder, Colorado by Andrew Hyde, Startup Weekend brought together 70 entrepreneurs to try to create a startup in just 54 hours. The model quickly expanded to cities around the world. In January 2010, Marc Nager and Clint Nelsen took over full ownership and registered the organization as a not-for-profit, relocating to Seattle. As of the acquisition, Startup Weekend had organized approximately 80 events in the USA, England, Germany and Canada. In February 2010, Franck Nouyrigat joined as a Co-Director and CTO. In the fall of 2010, Startup Weekend gained 501c3 status and received a grant from the Kauffman Foundation. By December 2010, the organization was composed of 8 full-time employees, over 15 'Key Facilitators', and more than 100 local organizers. In 2011, Startup Weekend launched the StartUp Foundation Initiative in partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. In June 2012, Startup Weekend opened its first regional offices in London and Mexico City. By 2016, Startup Weekend events ran in over 1000 cities around the world.\n\nStartup Weekend events span the course of a weekend (approximately 54 hours), and are generally composed of 60-120 participants (although events in the past have averaged 13–300+). In addition to attendees (otherwise known as 'Weekend Warriors'), the event attracts speakers, coaches, panelists (generally well-respected members of the local startup community or notable names in the tech industry), and various sponsors and company representatives. A good share of teams end up working together beyond the startup weekend to build a fully operating startup and others take with them the bootcamp experience and a network of like minds.\n\nStartup Weekend launched the Global Startup Battle in 2011 during Global Entrepreneurship Week. The 2012 battle included 10,000+ participants, 1,200+ teams, taking place in 100+ cities around the world. Global Startup Battle has three phases: First, the team must win the local Startup Weekend. Second, the team must win a Facebook popularity contest by receiving votes. Only the top 15 teams move on to the final stage. The final stage is a judging panel. In 2016, Global Startup Battle, shifted to become Global Startup Weekend, a world-wide celebration of Startup Weekends.\n\n"}

A determined discharged US Navy veteran succeeds in the lumber business.\n\nWhen the US Navy rigid airship \"Macon\" is damaged in a storm and crashes into the water (as the real did in 1935), helmsman Bill Austin stays with his commanding officer until the rest of the crew has gotten safely away. Bill loses a leg as a result of the crash and leaves the Navy.\n\nHe goes looking for employment, but jobs are scarce in San Francisco. He tries a lumber company run by Lloyd Skinner, interrupting a meeting between Skinner and his fiancee Margaret Ricks. Skinner orders him to leave his office. Matt Peasely, head of a shipping firm in the same building, is more polite, but the answer is still the same. Undeterred, Bill seeks out Cappy Ricks, the retired founder of both companies.\n\nWhile waiting in the reception area, he encounters Margaret again. He assumes she is also a job seeker and makes a date with her, unaware she is Cappy's only offspring. She sees her father first, and asks him to give Bill a chance. Cappy, who is frustrated with the way Skinner and Peasely have been running the businesses he built up, is quite willing to countermand them. He and Skinner decide to give Bill the hardest task they can think of: selling a half million feet of unwanted skunk spruce Cappy bought years ago as a favor to a friend. Not only does Bill sell all of the spruce, he also generates orders for all of the lumber the company has and more, all in a single business trip across the western United States, forcing Cappy to send him to Seattle to buy the shortfall from a hard-negotiating competitor.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill and Margaret fall in love. With his commission from his trip, he buys an engagement ring. When he tells Cappy of his plans, however, the widowed Cappy is adamantly opposed to losing Margaret's company. He and Skinner go ahead with the \"blue vase\" test, a test everybody has failed, including Skinner. Cappy telephones Bill and tells him he saw a vase he liked, but could not spare the time to purchase it. He gives Bill instructions to buy it whatever the cost and bring it to him at the railway station by eight o'clock. Cappy and Skinner have pre-arranged all sorts of obstacles to make the task impossible, but Bill overcomes them all, and by hocking Margaret's ring to help pay the $1000 price of the vase and persuading a Navy pilot friend (on his honeymoon night, no less) to fly him ahead of the already departed train, he succeeds. Cappy is so impressed, he offers Bill a promotion to manager of his Shanghai office.\n\nWhen Bill insists on marrying Margaret immediately so she can accompany him, Cappy does his best to stop him. He buys up all the staterooms in the ship Bill is to take, but Bill and Margaret get married and manage to sneak aboard the ship anyway. Then Cappy receives word that his men have gone on strike, and they trust and will only negotiate with Bill. Cappy sends him an urgent radiogram.

His father, a shipwright, had moved to Newcastle to find work, but died less than a year after Thomas was born and the family returned to their hometown of Peterhead, Aberdeenshire. They later moved back to Newcastle and Catto won a scholarship to Heaton School (later Rutherford College of Technology).\n\nAt the age of fifteen, Catto joined the Gordon Steam Shipping Company as a clerk. In 1898 he became secretary to William Horwood Stuart, managing partner of F. A. Mattievich & Co, based in Batumi and Baku, Russia.\n\nIn 1904 he was offered the management of the new London office of MacAndrews & Forbes, an American firm with interests in the East, one of whose partners was David Forbes, a fellow Scot with whom he had become friendly in Baku. Catto became a member of the Baltic Exchange. In 1906 he went to Smyrna as Forbes's deputy and travelled extensively in the Near East and Middle East. In 1909 he became a vice-president of the company at their New York office.\n\nToo short to serve in the armed forces during the First World War, he instead became involved in the transport of supplies to Russia and then served as the British Admiralty representative on the Russian Commission to the United States from 1915 to 1917. From 1917 to 1918 he served on the British Food Mission in the United States and in 1918 he was appointed chairman of the Allied Provisions Commission and head of the British Ministry of Food in North America.\n\nHe did not return to McAndrews & Forbes after the war; instead, in 1919, he became chairman of the vast Andrew Yule and Company Ltd. of Calcutta, succeeding Sir David Yule. This is now a private company 93.26% owned by the Government of India. Catto and Yule also formed Yule Catto & Company Ltd, which is now known as Yule Catto & Co plc and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 1928 he returned to London as a partner in the investment bank Morgan, Grenfell & Co., remaining chairman of Andrew Yule & Co and Yule Catto & Co until 1940.\n\nIn April 1940 he was appointed Director-General of Equipment and Stores at the Ministry of Supply and a Director of the Bank of England. In July 1941 he moved to become Financial Adviser to the Treasury. In April 1944 he was elected Governor of the Bank of England and served until February 1949, and overseeing the nationalisation of the bank.\n\nHe suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in Holmbury St Mary, Surrey in 1959. His son Stephen succeeded to his title.\n\nFor his services in the First World War, Catto was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1918 and created a baronet in the 1921 Birthday Honours. He was created Baron Catto, of Cairncatto, in 1936 and appointed to the Privy Council in 1947.\n\n"}
{"id": "52465947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52465947", "title": "Tomás Dolz de Espejo", "text": "Tomás Dolz de Espejo\n\nTomás Dolz de Espejo Andreu Muñoz Serrano y Duforq-Salinis, 5th Count of La Florida (1879-1974) was a Spanish politician and businessman. For some 30 years he campaigned within Traditionalism and Carlism. Periodically he was holding regional party leadership jobs, though nationwide he remained rather in the back row. He is best known as member of the first Junta Política and Consejo Nacional, executive bodies of the newly created Francoist state party, Falange Española Tradicionalista.\n\nThe Dolz lineage is related to Southern Aragón; its first representatives were noted in the late 12th century, once the successful Reconquista claimed Teruel. The family was initially linked to Albarracín, over time spreading to neighboring counties. The Espejo lineage originated from Northern parts of Kingdom of Valencia, resident in . The two families intermarried in the early 17th century, giving rise to the Dolz de Espejo branch. Many of its members made their names in history of Spain; Tomás’ great-grandfather, Pedro Federico Dolz de Espejo, was awarded the title of Conde de la Florida in 1789.\n\nHis son, the 2nd Count and the grandfather of Tomás, Pedro Pablo Dolz de Espejo, distinguished himself during the Napoleonic era. At the outbreak of the First Carlist War in 1833 he sided with the legitimists; following defeat he went into exile and died in 1842 in Bordeaux. His son and Tomás’ father, Pedro Manuel Dolz de Espejo (1820-1879), as 3rd Count returned to Spain re-assuming family landholdings in Teruel. He joined the Carlist conspiracy too, during Third Carlist War entrusted with economic issues; it was his signature present on banknotes, issued by the Carlists. He too went into exile, settling in Bayonne. He married a girl from another aristocratic Aragón family, María Andreu y Duforq-Salinis (1843-1920).\n\nBetween 1876 and 1879 the couple had 3 children; Tomás was born in France as the younger of two sons. It is not clear when the widow and half-orphans returned to Spain; she is first noted back in the family palace in Teruel in 1888. None of the sources consulted provides information on early years of Tomás, except that he was brought up in \"escuela de la lealtad y sacrificio\". It is neither clear where he received his education; because he was later referred to as \"engineer\" he probably studied technology, possibly in Madrid. At unspecified time in the 1900s he engaged in construction; in 1911 he was noted as manager of a Madrid-based company, La Constructora. In 1912 he was referred to as \"propietario\"; he took over the family business in 1913, following premature and childless death of his older brother, the 4th Count; he also inherited the title.\n\nIn 1912 Tomás Dolz married María de la Estrella González de la Riva Vidiella (1882-1989), daughter to teniente coronel de artillería 9th . The couple settled in Madrid at Conde Aranda; they had 3 children, born between 1913 and 1914. None of them became a public figure, though the only son, Carlos Dolz de Espejo y González de la Riva (1913-2013), an air force general, briefly gained media attention in relation to the most famous Spanish UFO incident of 1976. A younger daughter, María, married Antonio Galbis Loriga, Conde de Morphy, general de artillería and ayudante honoríficio to Franco. Among numerous grandchildren of Tomás and María, the best known ones are Carlos Dolz de Espejo y Arrospide, businessman and the 7th Conde de la Florida, and Alfonso Galbis Dolz de Espejo, a painter.\n\nWith two generations of ancestors serving the legitimist cause Dolz seemed poised to follow suit, especially that also his mother came from a Traditionalist family. However, during his youth Traditionalism was divided into mainstream Carlists and the breakaway Integrists. His brother, only 2 years senior, sided with the rebels; as a 16-year-old in 1893 he publicly voiced support for the Nocedalistas. In course of the 1890s Pedro Dolz de Espejo grew in the Integrist structures, in 1900 rising to president of the Valencian Junta Provincial and in 1907 entering the executive of Valencian Junta Regional. However, none of the sources consulted confirms (or denies) that Tomás followed his older brother; until the early 1910s he is not recorded as engaged in politics.\n\nDolz was first noted in political milieu in 1911; he demonstrated support to Traditionalist deputies from both the Integrist and Jaimist minorities, who in the Cortes in vain tried to block . In 1912 he was admitted to , a theoretically non-political but in fact highly conservative aristocratic organization. Following death of his older brother he became a somewhat prestigious figure in the Teruel realm and as such decided to join the electoral race: in 1914 he ran to the Cortes from Mora de Rubielos, a district in the Teruel province; it was also the first time he declared himself a Jaimista, member of Carlist branch supporting the claim of Don Jaime. The attempt proved premature and he lost pathetically, gaining 10 times fewer votes than a victorious candidate. Following the defeat Florida is never confirmed to have renewed his bid for the parliament.\n\nIn the mid-1910s Florida, already referred to in the press as \"rico propietario\", was already fully engaged in the Jaimista structures. In 1915 he was rumored to be running in the Cortes elections of the following year from the Madrid Latina district; the news eventually proved false, though in 1916 he was busy mounting an electoral alliance which would include even the Traditionalist arch-enemies, the Liberals. In 1917 he worked to seal an electoral union of the Jaimists, the Integrists, the Maurists and independent candidates, to be fielded in the forthcoming electoral campaign. He rose to first secretary of the Madrid municipal Jaimist organization, in 1918 growing to its jefe and soon also jefe of the provincial Madrid structures, though in general remained a back-row party figure.\n\nThough he seemed perfectly loyal to Don Jaime, in the new internal conflict within Carlism Florida tended rather to side with its key theorist, Juan Vázquez de Mella. This was demonstrated not only by Mellista-typical penchant for right-wing alliances, but also by advocating neutralist stand in the Great War, a strategy intended to counter pro-Entente feelings and effectively supporting the Central Powers. Florida was not among chief protagonists of the strife and remained in the background; however, when in 1919 Vázquez de Mella broke away and set up his own party, Dolz de Espejo decided to join him.\n\nIn 1920 Florida joined a 3-member Mellista Castilla La Nueva executive; in 1921 he assumed the position of Jefe Provincial in Madrid and honorary president of the Madrid branch of the party youth, Juventud Católica Tradicionalista. Reported as engaged in a variety of initiatives – setting up new cinemas in Madrid, collecting money for religious purposes, donating and organizing donations to army operations in Morocco, taking part in Catholic ceremonies, supporting sports- he was not, however, noted as busy building the party structures. In 1922 he attended a general Mellista assembly, taking place in Zaragoza and supposed to finalize buildup of the new party. The assembly launched Comité Directivo of the newly formed Partido Tradicionalista; Florida was one of its 3 members. He was also confirmed as the Madrid Jefe Provincial, temporarily given command of \"provincias del Centro, Sur y Oeste de España\". The Mellista project hardly took off the ground when the 1923 coup of Miguel Primo de Rivera banned all political parties in the country.\n\nFlorida withdrew to privacy, in public noted for charity and glamour of aristocratic societé. Resident of Madrid, he was spending strings at his La Florida property in Teruel and in estates in Valencia. Fascinated by cars he managed a Sitges circuit, excelled in Real Automovil Club and co-ran a tourist review; owner of a new Buick, he was fined for excessive driving until his car was stolen. Excluding landholding properties, he lived off a number of enterprises; apart from construction company he was president of Sociedad Española de Talcos and Compañia de Seguros Omnia. During Dolz renewed political endeavors. In May 1930 he was received by Alfonso XIII. Against the rising Republican tide he stood on monarchist ground, cultivating old-style patriotism. Having joined , in April 1931 he ran on its ticket in elections for the Madrid ayuntamiento.\n\nUpon declaration of the Republic Florida tried to transfer his capital abroad. Apprehended by the customs service he was detained and possibly suffered forfeiture of some of the assets smuggled. At unspecified time he returned to Carlist loyalty by entering , which in 1932 re-joined the former Jaimistas, Integristas and Mellistas. In 1933 he was appointed its Jefe Regional of Castilla La Nueva. Despite holding a theoretically prestigious position, Florida did not seem particularly active; he was seldom recorded as speaking at party meetings and historians almost do not mention his name when discussing Carlist activities during the Republic. It is not clear what his position was on controversial question of alliances with other monarchist and Right-wing groupings or on internal leadership rivalry between Conde de Rodezno and Manuel Fal. In 1935 the latter triggered his nomination to Junta de Hacienda, a body entrusted with organizing funds for the Comunión.\n\nIt is not clear whether Florida was engaged in Carlist preparations to the July 1936 coup; in particular there is no information whether he opted for unconditional alliance with the military or rather for negotiating terms and conditions. It is neither known where he was during the first days of the fighting. Later Francoist propaganda claimed that from the onset Florida acted as member of Junta Carlista de Guerra del Reino de León; the first confirmed information is that in September he emerged in Ciudad Rodrigo, busy organizing Requeté; in October his León efforts gained him a letter of thanks from the new Carlist regent, Don Javier. Though he is not listed as member of the national Carlist wartime executive, Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra, residing in Salamanca he started to take part in meetings of the Comunión leaders. For reasons which are not entirely clear his position grew; perhaps as a host Florida presided over a Carlist emergency meeting of December 1936, called to deal with Franco’s demand that Fal Conde leaves Spain. It is not clear what position he took; some historians discussing the day refer to him as \"Rodezno’s ally\", which suggests that Florida proposed that the ultimatum be accepted.\n\nStarting early 1937 the Carlists were facing a prospect of forced amalgamation into a state party; the claimant and the Falcondistas opted for intransigence, Rodezno and the Navarrese opted for negotiations. Florida was present at a February meeting in Insua and sided with the Rodeznistas, position maintained also in March. In early April he took part in a meeting of a somewhat rebellious Navarrese Junta Central; it adopted a Franco-addressed proposal suggesting a directorio, composed of Carlists, Falangists and caudillo’s appointees. In mid-April he was one of 4 Carlists summoned to Burgos; generalísimo informed them about forthcoming political unification. It is not clear why he was picked up by Franco; some suggest that Florida was among most \"conspicuous\" Carlists because of his Requeté recruitment activities.\n\nAt that time Franco and his aides were already considering personal composition of executive of the state party just to be announced. Florida was not among the Carlists initially marked; presented by Franco with shortlisted candidates, Rodezno suggested that Marcelino Ulibarri is dropped and one more seat is reserved for the Carlists, coming with the names of Florida and José María Mazón. The proposal was accepted and on April 22 Dolz found himself among 4 Carlists nominated to a 10-member \"Secretariado o Junta Política\" of Falange Española Tradicionalista. Of all its members he was perhaps the least-known one; among press-published short notes about the appointees, his was the shortest one. greatly disappointed many Carlists, including some of the Junta appointees; the regent was furious. In June the Carlist junteros asked him to authorize their presence in the Junta, but to no avail; later on all were expulsed from Comunión for breach of loyalty.\n\nFrustrated by lack of the Falangist give and take in the Junta, some Carlists complained to Franco; the result were October 1937 nominations to another party body, a 50-member Consejo Nacional. Florida found himself among 12 Carlist nominees and was already firmly mounted among highest-positioned civilians of the Francoist Spain, sitting in two bodies directing the only political organization allowed in the state. However, many historians agree that both executive structures were rather decorative and that the entire party was at that stage a nascent structure, called into being to ensure that power stays with Franco and yet to acquire its later dynamics. Moreover, the Carlists were enraged to find that what they supposed to be an organization they could control or at least influence was increasingly turning into a new version of Falange, with syndicalist blue-shirts systematically gaining the upper hand. Following unification Carlist rank-and-file started to bombard their leaders in Junta and in Consejo with complaints about getting sidetracked, asking for support. As recipient of these notes and phone calls Florida is recorded as pledging support; it is not clear whether he indeed intervened, though it is clear that nothing changed.\n\nThroughout most of the Civil War in public Florida maintained a loyal Francoist stand. In newspapers he was quoted arguing in favor of the unification; according to him both Carlism and Falange were anti-democratic, anti-Liberal, anti-parliamentarian and Catholic, he claimed also that both supported monarchist solution, to be implemented in the future. Apparently he also tried to cultivate the Traditionalist format as much as he could, with some other FET executives attending sermons honoring Carlist kings Carlos VII and Alfonso Carlos or taking part in annual Carlist feast dedicated to Mártires de la Tradición, initially observed by the state party. On the other hand, he did not refrain from attending new-style events, like banquets in the Nazi headquarters in Salamanca. In 1938 he acted as FET Jefe Provincial in Salamanca, typically one of the 3 most important civilian positions in every province; it is not clear what exact dates of his term were.\n\nFlorida’s career at the top of the Francoist political strata came to the end in late summer of 1939. As late as in August he was still reported taking part in public events as consejero nacional, but this changed in September; he did not find himself among appointees to the II Consejo Nacional and starting 1940 he was reported in the press simply as \"Conde de la Florida\". None of the sources consulted offers any insight into his departure from the party executive, and specifically whether it was a fall from grace or a conscious decision to withdraw. It could have been resignation following disappointment with the syndicalist format of the new party; it could have been marginalization suffered as a result of an internal conflict, as it happened with Joaquín Bau, another Carlist sidetracked by Ramón Serrano Suñer, especially that Florida publicly kept declaring inevitable restoration of the monarchy.\n\nNo longer in the top political flight, in the early 1940s Florida was still present in public life, e.g. taking part in Traditionalism-flavored feasts attended by some FET heavyweights. In 1942 he was not appointed to the III Consejo Nacional and his political career seemed definitely over. This might not have been exactly the case, as in 1944 he was reported among governmental officials, namely noted as subsecretario de industria. This was, however, definitely the last of his Francoist episodes; afterwards he was no longer mentioned related either to the party or to the government. He did not accept an olive branch from Carlism; in 1942 Fal declared that all those stained by Falangism might be re-admitted given they abandon their state party links; the offer explicitly excluded from the scheme some of the leaders, but Florida was not among them. In the late 1940s he ventured to publicly demonstrate support for Ricardo Oreja, his old-time fellow Mellista, when the latter succeeded in Madrid municipal elections.\n\nThough already at the retirement age, Florida remained active in a number of enterprises, mostly related to mineral resources and dependent businesses, like construction or pharmaceuticals; some of them, like RUMHE, landed hefty contracts in prestigious locations, like the Madrid Gran Vía. In the 1950s he regularly featured in societé columns, attending aristocratic feasts related and unrelated to his own family. His political engagements were almost inexistent, except that he kept attending the Mártires de la Tradición sermons. This changed abruptly in the mid-1950s. In 1956 Florida was awarded Gran Cruz del Mérito Civil, a very prestigious Francoist honor. In 1957 he was among 70-odd Carlists who concluded their longtime rapprochement with the Alfonsist claimant, Don Juan. Satisfied that formal acceptance of Traditionalist principles rendered him fit for succession also from the Carlist perspective, they declared him the legitimate heir to the throne. Florida, one of the most distinguished of the so-called \"Estorilos\", entered the claimant’s Consejo Privado, the post retained until the end of his life.\n\nAlso as an octogenarian Florida kept attending social events, at times assuming unlikely roles; in 1962 he formed part of a jury at a female beauty contest. He remained engaged in religious activities, in particular in ranks of Hermandad de Caballeros de San Juan Bautista y Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes; occasionally he presided over charity initiatives. Cautiously he kept admitting Traditionalist heritage; apart from cultural events like those dedicated to memory of Vázquez de Mella in the late 1960s he engaged in Hermandad de Cristo Rey de Requetés ex Combatientes, formally an organisation of Carlist Civil War combatants though in practice a Traditionalist bulwark in internal Carlist strife, aimed against a newly emergent progressist faction; nothing indicates he was aware of the background and historians extensively discussing internal fragmentation of Carlism in the 1960s and 1970s do not mention his name. Also in the late 1960s he kept cultivating the Juanista link; in the 1970s he was noted only as attending weddings of his grandchildren.\n\n\n\n"}
