Following an unsuccessful career in a tea company, first in London and then in Ceylon, India and Australia, he arrived in Tonga in 1901 as the branch manager of Sydney-based trading firm Burns Philp. Here, too, he was unsuccessful, soon being dismissed from the business, following which he took to drink and banished himself to a distant island for fifteen months to recuperate. In 1903 he married Clara Elizabeth (Kelela) Cocker, daughter of a European trader and a Tongan woman and granddaughter of Joshua Cocker, who had been British Vice-Consul of Tonga from May 1862 to August 1866. For a while he worked a commercial banana plantation on land belonging to his wife's family, but bankruptcy eventually brought an end to this enterprise.\n\nIn 1909 Cameron devised the idea of a Tongan cooperative of copra growers called Tonga Ma'a Tonga Kautaha and with the support of a noble titleholder, Vaea of Hauma, organised meetings in villages around Tongatapu, the main island in the Kingdom of Tonga, to explain the concept, that in addition to providing growers with a more lucrative alternative to the European trader cartel for the export of their produce it would also serve as a vehicle for Tongan aspirations and the acquisition of business skills of non-indigenous residents.\n\nPrior to the formation of Tonga Ma'a Tonga Kautaha, exporting of Tonga's copra crop had been under the control of European traders who benefited greatly from exceedingly high profit margins. They also controlled imports, often charging Tongans twice the price that they charged European residents.\n\nThe Kautaha opened in May 1909 with 1,300 members and by later that year had 3,280 from all three main islands in the kingdom - Tongatapu, Vava’u and Ha’apai - including many of Tonga's most influential nobles and chiefs. According to Mateialona, the Premier of Tonga at that time, Cameron was spoken of generally among Kautaha members as “an angel descended from Heaven to deliver them from the bondage of the White traders.”\n\nCameron's motivation was not solely benevolent. He earned a modest commission on sales which due to the large quantities of produce exported earned him between £1,300 to £1,500 during the first year of operation, contrasting starkly with his previous status as a bankrupt.\n\nThe cooperative drew the ire of the islands' European traders, who through the support of the local British Agent caused the collective to be investigated by the Auditor General and a report of the findings presented to its members, leading to its closure by Tonga's Premier on grounds of financial irregularities, for which Cameron was subsequently charged. On appeal, Cameron was acquitted of any wrongdoing and attempted to reform the collective, which was not successful and closed in about 1916, after which he relocated to Australia.\n\nCameron's venture had the unanticipated outcome of enhancing the nation's autonomy and significantly strengthening the authority of its monarch, King George Tupou II, following Cameron's acquittal because of the heavy-handedness of William Telfer Campbell, the British Agent, regarding the investigation and in his dealings with the monarch, which led to a redefining of the role of his office in relation to advice given to the monarch.\n"}

He is the Chairman of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.\n\nHe was first elected to office in 1994 as a municipal councillor in the Town of Hampstead. When Hampstead and all the other cities on the Montreal island were forced to merge into the City of Montreal by the Parti Quebecois government in 2001, he was elected as a municipal councilor in the borough of Côte-Saint-Luc-Hampstead-Montreal West. Housefather then led the demerger movement in his borough. Following the successful demerger of all three municipalities as determined in a referendum on June 20, 2004, he was elected Mayor of the City of Côte-Saint-Luc, and served from 2005 until 2015, when he resigned following his election to Parliament.\n\nHousefather was first elected to Parliament in the Canadian federal election of October 2015. On February 16, 2016, Housefather was unanimously elected Chairman of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.\n\nHousefather holds two law degrees (B.C.L. and LL.B.) from McGill University, and an MBA from Concordia University's John Molson School of Business. Before his election to federal office, he served as Executive Vice President, Corporate Affairs and General Counsel, at Dialogic Corporation, a multinational technology company.\n\nHousefather was a nationally ranked athlete as a student. He returned to competitive swimming in 2010, and earned seven medals (two silver, and five bronze) in swimming masters events at the 2013 Maccabiah Games in Israel, and five at the 2017 Maccabiah Games.\n\nHousefather was born in Montreal, Canada, and is Jewish. His grandparents were all born in Montreal.\n\nHe went to Herzliah High School, and is fluent in Hebrew. He earned two law degrees (B.C.L. and LL.B.) from McGill University, and an MBA from Concordia University's John Molson School of Business.\n\nHousefather became active in the Mount Royal Liberal Association as a teenager. He was elected as Policy Vice President of the Young Liberals of Canada's Quebec wing in 1991, and in 1992 was elected to the Liberal Party's national executive as Policy Vice President of the Young Liberals of Canada. In that role he worked on the platform committee for the development of the Red Book, the Liberal Party platform in the 1993 campaign.\n\nWhen his term on the national executive ended, Housefather ran for Hampstead Town Council and was elected in 1994, defeating two other candidates. He was re-elected in 1998, and served in this capacity until 2001, when the Quebec government forced all cities and towns on the Island of Montreal to merge.\n\nHousefather was involved in organizations working on behalf of Quebec's English-speaking minority in the 1990s. In addition to being involved with Federation CJA's Pro Montreal at its inception, he was also involved in the creation of Youth Employment Services. Both of these groups concentrated on keeping the youth of the English-speaking community in Quebec by helping them find jobs.\n\nHe also served on the Board of Directors, and then as the Executive, of Alliance Quebec. Housefather was elected President of Alliance Quebec in 2000 and served until 2001, when he ran for office in the new mega-city of Montreal following the forced mergers.\n\nHousefather, together with the vast majority of Mayors and Councillors of suburban municipalities, opposed the forced mergers which created the mega-city of Montreal. When the Quebec Court of Appeals ruled that the cities had no constitutional protection against the forced mergers, Housefather joined many suburban mayors and councillors who ran for election in the mega-city of Montreal, campaigning on the promise to support demerger if a new government ever permitted it. In the 2001 election, he was elected as a Councillor for the Borough of Côte-Saint-Luc–Hampstead–Montreal West, receiving approximately 70% of the vote.\n\nWhen the Quebec Liberal Party was elected in 2003, it set in motion a process that permitted cities and towns to de-merge from the mega-city. Housefather was alone amongst the three elected Councillors in Côte Saint-Luc-Hampstead-Montreal West to support the demerger of the three communities. In 2004, he served as co-chair of the demerger committee of the Côte-Saint-Luc along with former City Councillors Mitchell Brownstein, Ruth Kovac, and Glenn J. Nashen. He was also a member of the Hampstead Demerger Committee and the Montreal West Demerger Committee. On June 20, 2004, all three communities voted to demerge from Montreal, with the Yes vote representing 91% of the votes cast in Hampstead, 87% of the votes cast in Côte Saint-Luc, and 84% of the votes cast in Montreal West. Thus, all three municipalities were reconstituted within their former borders as of January 1, 2006, with elections scheduled for November 2005.\n\nOn November 7, 2005, Housefather was elected Mayor of the reconstituted City of Côte-Saint-Luc, winning election with 75% of the vote while former Mayor Bernard Lang received 14% of the vote, and a third opponent receiving 10% of the vote.\n\nHousefather was a very popular and well-respected Mayor, and was re-elected by acclamation to a second term as Mayor of Côte-Saint-Luc on October 2, 2009, in advance of a November 1, 2009, vote. He was acclaimed again on October 4, 2013, in advance of a November 4, 2013, vote.\n\nAs Mayor, Housefather was very involved in provincial as well as local issues. He led the fight by bilingual municipalities against the Parti Quebecois' government's Bill 14, which amongst other things would have deprived many Quebec municipalities of bilingual status. He drafted and presented a brief with Town of Mount Royal Mayor Philippe Roy at the National Assembly of Quebec on Bill 14 on March 11, 2013.\n\nHe also held a rally at Côte Saint-Luc City Hall for religious tolerance, and led in the opposition to the PQ's Charter of Values which sought to bar any employee from wearing religious gear in schools, hospitals, municipalities and provincial government. Both of these bills were dropped.\n\nDuring the years when Côte Saint-Luc was in Montreal, a collective agreement was signed by the mega-city giving firefighters a monopoly on first response, which put Côte Saint-Luc's much valued Emergency Measures Service at risk of disappearing. With the help of D'Arcy-McGee MNA Lawrence Bergman, Housefather was able to convince the Quebec Government to add a provision to Bill 22 to allow Côte Saint-Luc to operate its first-responder service permanently. Housefather also was able to work with other mayors to save a local police station and to convince the Agglomeration of Montreal to adopt a resolution allocating $44 million for the Cavendish extension. He also worked with Councillor Dida Berku and environmental groups to help preserve the Meadowbrook Golf Vourse as a green space.\n\nAt a local level, Housefather and his council were viewed as one of the most innovative councils in Quebec. Côte Saint-Luc built an $18 million Aquatic and Community Centre on time and under budget, and developed one of Montreal's leading aquatics programs. Under the Housefather administration, Côte Saint-Luc was the first city on the island of Montreal to launch a composting program for all single-family homes, the first to launch a food policy, and launched a farmer's market and community gardens. The median age of residents of the City of Côte Saint-Luc fell by seven years over Housefather's tenure as Mayor, as the community expanded high-quality programs for children and young adults and sponsored townhouses and other housing favourable to young families. But at the same time a permanent home was found for the City's seniors clubs and legion.\n\nIn addition to his duties within local government, between 2006 and 2015 Housefather also served as the Secretary of the Association of Suburban Municipalities (ASM), which represents the 15 demerged cities and towns on the Island of Montreal. Housefather was also a member of the island-wide Montreal agglomeration council and the agglomeration's Public Security Commission.\n\nWhen Liberal Party of Canada MP Irwin Cotler announced he would not run in the 2015 federal election in the Mount Royal riding, Housefather was supported by most of the elected officials in the riding when he declared his intention to run. His Liberal nomination opponent was communications strategist Jonathan Goldbloom. Housefather said his 20 successful years in municipal politics were excellent preparation for the role of MP. Over the course of the year he signed up over 3,000 residents of the riding to support him at the nominating meeting.\n\nThe Mount Royal nomination meeting took place on November 30, 2014. With 1,948 ballots cast, Housefather was declared the winner and the official Liberal Party candidate for the 2015 federal election.\n\nThe Conservative Party targeted Mount Royal in the 2015 election, with Prime Minister Stephen Harper launching his party's campaign in Mount Royal. Housefather ran a vigorous door-to-door campaign, and managed to assemble support from a wide variety of communities within the riding as well as the majority of elected officials at the municipal and school board election. Housefather and the NDP candidate debated four times in the riding, with the Conservative candidate participating in two of the debates and refusing two. However, Housefather debated against Conservative candidate Robert Libman on CTV and Radio Shalom, and all three candidates debated on CJAD.\n\nFollowing the campaign, Housefather was elected as the Member of Parliament for Mount Royal on October 19, 2015, with 50.4% of the vote, and tripling the Liberal majority from the 2011 election.\n\nHousefather was profiled as one of 10 rookie MPs to watch in the new parliament.\n\nOn February 16, 2016, he was elected as Chairman the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.\n\nLater that month, Housefather earned international media attention for a speech he delivered in support of an anti-Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) motion put forward in the House of Commons. The motion urged the government to reject the goals of the BDS movement. while calling on the government to \"condemn any and all attempts by Canadian organizations, groups or individuals to promote [it] both here at home and abroad.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and most other Liberals voted in favour of the motion, which passed 229-51.\n\nOn March 25, 2015, Housefather echoed Foreign Minister Stéphane Dion`s criticism of the UN Human Rights Council`s decision to appoint University of Western Ontario law professor Michael Lynk as its Special Rapporteur on human rights in Palestine. This followed criticism from Jewish groups including the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, which accused Lynk of bias against Israel.\n\nHousefather received considerable acclaim for his chairing of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, with committee members from all parties praising his handling of the difficult committee hearings on the assisted dying bill C-14.\n\nAs of May 20, 2016, no rookie Liberal MP had spoken more in the House of Commons than Housefather.\n\nIn February 2016, Housefather relayed the support of the constituents in his riding for the Cavendish Boulevard extension between Côte St. Luc and St. Laurent in the House of Commons. In May 2016, Quebec Liberals adopted a resolution calling for the Cavendish extension to be realized.\n\nIn April 2016, Housefather and Minister of Families, Children and Social Development Jean-Yves Duclos announced the federal government would provide $390,913 over a period of three years for a new drop-in centre, which provides relief for caregivers of seniors, at the Côte St. Luc Aquatic and Community Centre as part of the New Horizons for Seniors Program. In total $1.1 million was received for senior programs assisting caregivers in the riding.\n\nIn May, Housefather announced that over 270 summer jobs had been created for students in the riding, with more than double the number of jobs created than in 2015.\n\nIn the election campaign, Housefather had promised to hold quarterly town hall meetings in the riding to give constituents a report on what is happening in Ottawa and in the riding and to take questions as he did as Mayor. The first town hall meeting was held in Hampstead in January and the second was held in the Town of Mount Royal in April. The meetings are called Anthony's Assemblies.\n\nHousefather has written several opinion pieces for Canadian newspapers, and has been interviewed on local and national news networks, sharing his views on subjects including his experience as a member of parliament, minority language issues, and his support of more permissive surrogacy laws in Canada.\n\nHousefather was a competitive swimmer in his teens, and then a competitive water polo player. He started competitive swimming again in 2010. In July and August 2013, Housefather won seven medals in the Masters category in swimming at the 2013 Maccabiah Games in Israel. He won five medals in a number of Masters (35+) swimming events at the 2017 Maccabiah Games.\n\nHousefather swims on the Parliamentary Swim Team, and runs with the running group on the Hill, which, as part of a wider fitness initiative, aims to keep members of Parliament physically active while promoting health and physical fitness. He advocates for athletics and physical fitness as a Member of Parliament, serving as the Liberal Party lead on the Parliamentary fitness initiative started by former MP John Weston.\n\n"}

Following a gradual deterioration in relations between the AOI member-states, Egypt became sole owner of AOI in 1993. As well as meeting the requirements of the Egyptian military, AOI directs spare capacity to civilian programmed, including civilian transport and sanitation equipment, AOI has stated its intention of entering the wind power sector.\n\nInitially an institution of Pan-Arabism, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates returned their shares in AOI, valued at US$1.8 billion, to Egypt in 1993, leaving AOI wholly owned by the Egypt. AOI has approximately 16,000 employees, out of which 1,250 are engineers. AOI fully owns 12 factories and shares in 1 joint-ventures, besides the Arab Institute for Development Technology.\n\nAOI was established by its four member-states - Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - in response to the threat posed by the advanced Israeli defence industry. The initial capitalisation of AOI was USD 1 billion, contributed in equal part by the four member-states, although with the understanding AOI would be based in Egypt.\n\nIn 1978, AOI and Westland Helicopters, a British aerospace company, established the \"Arab British Helicopter Company\" as a joint venture, but a year later AOI announced the company's liquidation. In ensuing arbitration, the International Chamber of Commerce made an award, on grounds of breach of the principles of natural law and good faith, in favour of Westland Helicopters and against AOI's four member-states. This award was later annulled by the Court of Justice of Geneva, which annulment was upheld by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, on grounds that the arbitrators had jurisdiction over AOI but not over the organisation's member-states.\n\nFollowing the signing of the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty (1979), Egypt had its membership to the Arab League suspended and a policy of economic isolation implemented against it. It was in this atmosphere that the three AOI member-states other than Egypt - Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - withdrew from the AOI, causing its collapse.\n\nIn 1983, the Egyptian chief-of-staff restated his interest in the joint manufacture of weapons, but it was only after the 1987 Arab League summit in Amman, Jordan, when the Arab League re-admitted Egypt and the other Arab states normalised relations with Egypt, that the possibility of renewed co-operation among the AOI member-states seemed possible.\n\nThe UAE seemed similarly eager to reinvigorate the AOI: in 1988, Egypt and the UAE held talks with Qatar about its re-entry into the AOI, at which an agreement for closer co-operation between Egypt and Qatar in the fields of culture and communication was signed.\n\nAOI is one of the largest industrial organisations in Egypt with significant international relationships both in the defence and civilian transport sectors. The AOI is wholly state-owned by Egypt and administered by a \"Supreme Committee\", the chairman of which is the Egyptian president and which includes several cabinet ministers, but it is not a division of the \"Ministry of Military Production\" as the treaty upon which it was established declares the Arab Organization for Industrialization as an independent international Organisation, even though it is now only owned by Egypt but the establishing treaty stays the same, and changing it requires the consent of the establishing parties .\n\nAll AOI enterprises are ISO 9000/2001 and ISO 14001/2004 certified.\n\nThe AOI's \"Aircraft Factory\" (, abbreviated \"ACF\") was established in 1950 as Helwan Aircraft Factory and is a key aerospace manufacturer in Egypt. It is located in Helwan.\n\nThe AOI Aircraft Factory manufactures and assembles aircraft for the Egyptian air force, including:\n\n\nThe K-8E is an Egyptian variant of the Chinese Hongdu JL-8, exported as the Karakorum-8 (or K-8) to (among others) Pakistan, Zambia and Myanmar. The K-8E's manufacture at the AOI Aircraft Factory began in 2000, under an agreement between the AOI and CATIC, the Chinese state-owned aerospace manufacturer, to produce a total of 60 K-8s over five years. The contract, valued at US$347.4 million, was signed in 1999 in connection with the state visit by Chinese president Jiang Zemin that year. Initially, most of the parts were manufactured in China and the aircraft were assembled in Egypt, but by the end of the programme the manufacture was to be carried out entirely at the AOI Aircraft Factory. In the end, 98% of each K-8E was locally manufactured.\n\nThe AOI Aircraft Factory also manufactures aircraft parts for the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA), Dassault Aviation and SAGEM, and has received certification from the ECAA for its welding, painting, testing and calibration operations. The AOI Aircraft Factory also engages in civilian and technological projects.\n\nIn 1960, the \"Engine Factory\" () was established by the Egyptian military with German technical assistance as a base to design, develop and produce aircraft engines. The first engines produced at the Engine Factory were:\n\n\nIn 1975, the Engine Factory was affiliated to AOI, since when it has focused its activities on the manufacture, assembly, repair and overhaul of gas turbines and accessories. The AOI Engine Factory has established maintenance facilities for auxiliary power units and SNECMA Atar 09C, T56, CT64, PT6-25 and -64, Larzac 04, R-13 and R-25 engines.\n\nThe AOI Engine Factory directs spare capacity to civilian projects, including the manufacture of fuel injectors for Robert Bosch GmbH, air brake systems for Knorr-Bremse and rail fastening clips for Pandrol.\n\nCompatible ordnance for BM-21 Grad, D-30 and M-46 Artillery systems, M60 Tanks, 85 mm divisional gun D-44, and ZSU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns.\n\nM60 Tanks and M1A1 Abrams assembly from knock down kits\n\nM60 and M1A1 Abrams engines and spare parts\n\nMisr assault rifle and AK 47 complete manufacture (7,000 assault rifles a year), compatible ammunition\n\n\nAOI Electronics Factory\n\nSakr Factory for Development Industries (AOI)\n\nKader Factory for Development Industries (AOI)\n\nArab British Engine Co.

{"id": "54886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54886", "title": "Basil Zaharoff", "text": "Basil Zaharoff\n\nBasil Zaharoff, GCB, GBE (; October 6, 1849 – November 27, 1936), was a Greek arms dealer and industrialist. One of the richest men in the world during his lifetime, Zaharoff was described as a \"merchant of death\" and \"mystery man of Europe\". His success was forged through his cunning, often aggressive and sharp business tactics. These included the sale of arms to opposing sides in conflicts, sometimes delivering fake or faulty machinery.\n\nBasileios Zacharias was the son and eldest of four children of a Greek merchant, born in the Ottoman Empire town of Muğla. His family adopted the surname Zaharoff when they lived in Russia, as exiles following the anti-Greek \"Easter pogroms\" of 1821. The family returned to the Ottoman Empire in the 1840s and, by 1855, had returned to Constantinople's Greek neighbourhood of Tatavla.\nBasileios' first job was as a tour guide in the Galata. It is thought he became an arsonist with the Istanbul firefighters: on payment 19th-century firemen in Istanbul recovered or salvaged treasures for their wealthy owners.\n\nZaharoff was summoned to court in London due to irregular exports of goods from Istanbul to London. The London Greeks from Constantinople preferred disputes involving members of their community to be settled outside English courts, and he was discharged on the conditions that he paid £100 restitution to the claimant and remained within the court's jurisdiction. He immediately left for Athens, where the 24-year-old Zaharoff was befriended by a political journalist, Etienne Skouloudis. The eloquent Zaharoff succeeded in convincing Skouloudis of the rightness of his London court case.\n\nBy a stroke of good fortune, Skouloudis was a friend of a Swedish captain, who was about to leave his job as an agent of arms manufacturer Thorsten Nordenfelt. Skouloudis used his influence to recommend Zaharoff for the role. Zaharoff was hired on October 14, 1877, beginning a spectacular career. The political and military instability in the Balkan states, Turkey and Russia provided an excellent opportunity for the arms sales, as each state spent to match the perceived aggressive intentions of its neighbours, even after the 1878 Treaty of Berlin.\n\nZaharoff did not make arms dealing his sole business at first. After Cyprus passed under British control in 1878 he seems to have slipped back into Britain; by 1883 he was working as a shipping agent in Galway, Ireland, where he recruited local girls for work in American factories. He also had a spell in the United States where he worked as a confidence man, and later as a salesman for a St. Louis railcar business. In 1885, posing as \"Prince Zacharias Basileus Zacharoff\", he married a Philadelphia heiress, Jennie Billings, and was pursued to Rotterdam by detectives after his exposure as a bigamist by an Englishman who recognised him as the same man who had married an English girl in Bristol in 1872.\n\nZaharoff sold munitions to many nations, including Great Britain, Germany, the Russian and Ottoman Empires, Greece, Spain, Japan and the United States. Despite his reputation for corruption, he was instrumental in marketing military equipment, including various famous weapons such as the Maxim gun (one of the first fully automatic machine guns) and the first working submarine. The British-Swedish Nordenfelt produced a range of anti-torpedoboat guns in Erith, Kent, Stockholm and Spain.\n\nZaharoff worked for Vickers, the munitions firm, from 1897 to 1927.\n\nHiram Maxim's automatic machine gun was a significant improvement over the then-current hand-cranked models. Maxim's gun was better than anything that Nordenfelt sold at the time. Zaharoff is believed to have had a hand in the events surrounding Maxim's attempts to demonstrate his invention between 1886 and 1888. In the first, Maxim's and Nordenfelt's machine guns were to be demonstrated at La Spezia, Italy, before a distinguished audience which included the Duke of Genoa. Maxim's representatives did not show up; a person unknown had waylaid them with a tour of La Spezia's nocturnal establishments leaving them unfit for purpose the next morning.\n\nRound 2 took place at Vienna, where the exhibitors were instructed to modify their weapons to comply with Austrian Infantry-standard sized cartridges. After shooting a few hundred rounds, the Maxim gun became erratic before stopping altogether. When Maxim took one weapon apart to see what had happened, he discovered that they had been sabotaged, but it was too late to repair. A third demonstration also took place in Vienna, and here the gun worked perfectly. But again an unknown person went through the gathering of senior officers, convincing them that the workmanship required to produce such a marvellous weapon could only be done by hand, one at a time, and that without the means for mass production, Maxim could never produce machine guns in sufficient quantities to satisfy the needs of a modern army. Nordenfelt and Zaharoff had won. Maxim, who knew he had a good product, successfully sought a merger with Nordenfelt, engaging Zaharoff as their principal salesman on a huge commission.\n\nUnder pressure from Rothschild and Vickers, Thorsten Nordenfelt merged with Maxim's in 1888 to form the Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company. Two years later, a bankrupt Nordenfelt was forced out of the company.\n\nFrom 1886 to 1889, at the same time that Zaharoff got the Maxim machine gun, he managed to appropriate Isaac Peral's submarine; although these facts are less well known. Zaharoff and Nordenfelt tried at this time to develop a submarine for their own business purposes.\n\nOne of the most notorious sales by Zaharoff was that of the \"Nordenfelt I\", a faulty steam-driven submarine model based on a design by the English inventor and clergyman George Garrett, which US Navy intelligence characterized as capable of \"dangerous and eccentric movements.\" Thorsten Nordenfelt had already demonstrated his vessel at an international gathering of the military elite, and whilst the major powers would have none of it, smaller nations, attracted by the prestige, were a different matter.\n\nIt was thus that, with a promise of generous payment terms, Zaharoff sold the first model to the Greeks. He then convinced the Turks that the Greek submarine posed a threat, selling them two. After that, he persuaded the Russians that there was now a new and significant threat on the Black Sea, and they bought another two.\n\nNone of these submarines ever saw action. The mechanics, driven by steam propulsion, were completely inadequate for underwater navigation, and failed demonstrably when undergoing sea trials by the respective Navies.\nBesides the underlying problems of the faulty propulsion system, they were also chronically unstable. One of the Turkish Navy's submarines sank, capsizing during a torpedo firing test. The vessel reared in a vertical position, from which it sank by the stern.\n\nAt this time Spanish inventor Isaac Peral designed and built the first submarine capable of navigating underwater with a decent level of control and with the ability to launch torpedoes both submerged and on the surface. This was the first proper submarine, solving the problems of propulsion, stability and armament all at once. Peral's submarine was driven by electric propulsion, and had a periscope, target practice apparatus, compensating compass needle, gyroscope, sliding electric torpedo tube launcher and servomotor (to maintain the stability and the trim of the ship in all circumstances).\n\nZaharoff found out within no time about this young Spanish Naval officer's invention. Previously in shipbuilding, he had already seen the plans and memorandum reports sent by Peral to the Spanish Navy's HQ at the Defence Ministry.\n\nLater on, during Peral's visit to London, Zaharoff tried meeting with him unsuccessfully, with the help of one of Peral's Spanish Navy fellow officers. Peral refused twice, but after several attempts, he had a meeting with Thorsten Nordenfelt, the company owner, who offered him a deal to purchase the patent of the stability servomotor. Isaac Peral rejected both offers but signed his sentence in that same instant, without knowing it.\n\nZaharoff then got to work with his own Machiavellian plan. The Spanish inventor, as with Maxim, suffered four sabotages during the tests: the first of them, in the previous test, in the presence of the Head of the Spanish State, but, Peral, more cautious than the North American inventor, proved successful in all of them.\n\nDespite this, Zaharoff used underhand methods, which came to light later, and was able to cause a controversy between the inventor and his own government leading to the Spanish Government's disapproval of this submarine invention, although it would have been a formidable weapon in the conflict with the United States, several years after.\n\nZaharoff traveled to Spain several times between 1886 and 1890 with three objectives: boycott Peral's submarine, sell weapons to the Spanish Army, and acquire a Spanish munitions factory. He was successful in all three objectives, mainly because his initiation of an amorous relationship with Pilar de Muguiro y Beruete opened many doors for him.\n\nPilar's father, influential banker Fermín Muguiro, Count of Muguiro, was a close friend of the King, and leader of Spanish Conservative Party. She was a personal friend and niece of Segismundo Moret, a leading Spanish progressive thinker and the Liberal Party Leader's right-hand man. Unhappily married to King Alfonso XII's cousin, the Spanish Grandee, Francisco de Borbón, Duke of Marchena, she had unrestricted access to the Royal Palaces. During one trip, Zaharoff was spotted at the shipyard where the Spanish submarine was being built, but the Spanish authorities \"covered up\" the matter.\n\nThe acquisition of one of the best Spanish armament companies, Euskalduna, located in north Spain and renamed “Placencia de las Armas Co. Ltd” was in large part thanks to his love affair (later attributing his professional success to his sexual prowess), and through establishing a powerful network among Spanish politicians, journalists and military commanders, who served his business interests well. This influential group of people took his side against the development of Isaac Peral's submarine, and the Spanish Government, despite the astounding success in sea trials, finally pulled the rug from the project.\n\nAfter “Placencia de Armas Co. Ltd” swindled the Spanish Government by selling useless arms during the 1898 War (also handing Maxim important and \"sensitive\" information, which reached his government during the conflict), the Sociedad Española de Construcciones Navales in Spain, a branch of Vickers were awarded, by the Spanish Government, exclusive naval construction rights for the Spanish Navy.\n\nIn the aftermath of this scandal, accusations of bribery and manipulation flew in the direction of this dangerous trafficker of weapons. A Spanish Navy lawyer denounced the Spanish Government for two alleged crimes of \"prevarication.\" The Spanish Government acted expeditiously and especially cruelly against any naval officers who went public with their discontent. The Central Chief of Staff and the Boss of the Armada Juridic Service were fired, and hundreds of officers were imprisoned and lost their jobs.\n\nZaharoff's power and influence in Spain lasted until his death in 1936, the year in which the Spanish Civil War began.\n\nAlso, the 1934 United States Senate Nye Committee Memorandum shows that Zaharoff was paid considerable sums for transactions made between foreign companies and the Spanish Government (for example, he got paid between a 5 and 7% commission for the price of American submarines sold to Spain, throughout all these years).\n\nAlthough very little could be proved, Zaharoff was viewed as a master of bribery and corruption, but the few incidents that did become public, such as the large bribes received by Japanese Admiral Fuji (is this anachronistically referring to the 1914 Siemens scandal?), indicated that a lot more was going on behind the scenes. In 1890, the Maxim-Nordenfelt association broke up, and Zaharoff chose to go with Maxim. Using his commissions, Zaharoff bought shares in Maxim’s company until he was in a position to tell Maxim that he was no longer an employee, but an equal shareholder.\n\nBy 1897, the Maxim company had become important enough that it received a buyout offer from Vickers, one of the then giants of the armaments industry. This involved substantial settlements in both cash and shares for Maxim and Zaharoff. From then until 1911, while Maxim's business enthusiasm waned, Zaharoff's enthusiasm grew, and he expanded his portfolio of Vickers shares. After Maxim's retirement, Zaharoff was appointed to Vickers' board of directors.\n\nThe 1900s (decade) was a time for many European armies to rebuild and modernize. Germany and the United Kingdom both sought improved naval capability, and Vickers, with Zaharoff, were willing and able to service both sides. After its disastrous defeat by Japan in 1905, the Russian Navy also needed new equipment, but Russia was handcuffed by a wave of protectionism that required domestic industry for the rebuilding. Zaharoff’s response was to build a huge Russian arms production complex at Tsaritsyn as a subsidiary of Vickers.\n\nThe opening of Russian Tsarist archives after World War I led to some insights into the tactics of the arms industry. One 1907 letter, in particular, was written from the Paul von Gontard Factory (a secretly-controlled Vickers company in Germany) to a Vickers-associate in Paris recommending that press releases be sent out to the French press suggesting that the French improve their military to meet the threat posed by German re-armament. These French newspaper articles were recorded by the Reichstag, and instigated a vote to increase military spending, all of which worked to the advantage of Zaharoff.\n\nIn the years immediately preceding World War I, Zaharoff’s fortunes grew in other areas to support his arms business. By purchasing the \"L'Union Parisienne des Banques\" (Union Parisienne Bank), which was traditionally associated with heavy industry, he was better able to control his financing arrangements. By gaining control of \"Excelsior,\" the popular French daily newspaper, he could guarantee favourable editorials for the arms industry. To gain public recognition and acclaim, he founded a retirement home for ex-French sailors, while a Chair in Aerodynamics at the University of Paris led to further honours.\n\nIn April 1914, Australian newspapers published reports from London dated 25 April that M. Zaharoff had donated ₤20,000 \"in order to enable France to be worthily represented at the forthcoming Olympic Games in Berlin\" in 1916. The 1916 Olympic Games were subsequently cancelled because of the war. Zaharoff's donation represented a substantial contribution. On May 10, the French Government announced it would donate ₤6,000 to its Olympic team, and would distribute ₤12,000 of Zaharoff's donation among its Olympic teams, with the remaining ₤8,000 to \"the furtherance of the Olympic cause.\"\n\nOn July 31, 1914, coincidentally the same day that the noted antimilitarist Jean Jaurès was assassinated, Raymond Poincaré signed a decree appointing Zaharoff a Commander of the Legion of Honour.\n\nIn March 1914, Vickers announced a new dawn of prosperity. During the course of the war, Vickers would produce 4 ships of the line, 3 cruisers, 53 submarines, 3 auxiliary vessels, 62 light vessels, 2,328 cannon, 8,000,000 tonnes of steel ordnance, 90,000 mines, 22,000 torpedoes, 5,500 airplanes and 100,000 machine guns. By 1915, Zaharoff had close ties with both David Lloyd George and Aristide Briand. It is reported that, on the occasion of one visit with Briand, Zaharoff surreptitiously left an envelope on Aristide Briand’s desk; the envelope contained a million francs for war widows.\n\nOne of Zaharoff’s tasks during the Great War was to ensure that Greece joined the war on the Allied side, helping to reinforce the eastern front. On the surface, this seemed impossible since King Constantine was a brother-in-law of the Kaiser. Setting up a press agency in Greece to spread news favourable to the Allies, led, within a few months, to Constantine’s deposal in favour of Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos.\n\nBy the end of World War I, \"The Times\" estimated that Zaharoff had laid out £50 million in the Allied cause.\n\nIn the years that followed, Zaharoff involved himself in the affairs of the lesser powers, which the Big Four, involved in remaking Europe, could happily ignore. In particular, he set out to ensure that Greece and Venizelos received a proper share from the spoils from the badly weakened Turkey. In 1920, he donated half a billion gold francs to the Greek State for the Greek cause (Megali Idea). Zaharoff convinced Venizelos to attack but, after some impressive initial success, the Greek Army was eventually driven back. In the elections that followed, Constantine’s loyalists managed to force Venizelos to flee, but Zaharoff stayed around to persuade the same King that he had to attack Turkey again. But with Mustafa Kemal now in charge of Turkey, this venture was bound to fail. Zaharoff’s war adventures were not well received by the press in Paris and London.\n\nZaharoff was also involved in two more significant financial ventures in October 1920, becoming involved in the incorporation of a company that was a predecessor to oil giant British Petroleum. He foresaw that there was a great future in the oil business.\n\nHis association with Prince Louis II of Monaco led to his purchase of the debt-ridden \"Société des Bains de Mer\", which ran Monte Carlo’s famous casino and was the principal source of revenue for the principality. He succeeded in returning the casino to profit again. At the same time, Zaharoff had prevailed upon Clemenceau to ensure that the Treaty of Versailles included protection of Monaco’s rights as established in 1641. Louis had noted their gradual erosion over the subsequent three centuries.\n\nZaharoff was friends with the actress Sarah Bernhardt and her Greek husband Jacques Damala. When Damala's mistress had an illegitimate daughter by Damala in 1889, she left the baby and a note in a basket on Sarah Bernhardt's doorstep. Baptised Teresa, the baby was given to Zaharoff, who found a family to raise her in eastern Thrace (at Adrianopole).\n\nZaharoff was fascinated by aviation, and gave money and other support to pioneers in Great Britain, France and Russia. He encouraged Hiram Maxim's attempt to build a flying machine, and claimed he and Maxim were the first men to be lifted off the earth, when Maxim tested his first \"flying machine\" at Bexley in 1894.\n\nHe married an English woman — it is believed as of mid-February 1911 — primarily to obtain a British passport.\n\nIn September 1924, Zaharoff, 74, married María del Pilar Antonia Angela Patrocinio Fermina Simona de Muguiro y Beruete, 1st Duchess de Villafranca de los Caballeros. Previously married to a cousin of the King of Spain Alfonso XII, Lady Zaharoff was reputed to be one of the richest women in Spain. About eighteen months after their marriage, she died of an infection.\n\nAfter the death of Lady Zaharoff he began selling his business assets and drafted his memoirs. He apparently burnt the manuscript after it was stolen by a valet and recovered by police.\n\nZaharoff's country house, the Château de Balincourt, at Arronville near Paris, was formerly the property of King Leopold II of Belgium was filled with works of art and one of the most beautiful in France. \n\nPrincess Marthe Bibesco claims Basil Zaharoff was an illegitimate son of her maternal grandfather.\n\nZaharoff was a major financial benefactor to various institutions:\n\n\n\nBasil Zaharoff is mentioned in a list of mysterious \"Orient Express\" characters in the Madrid - Lisbon train corridor conversation between Lucas Corso and \"Irene Adler\" in The Club Dumas (Chapter VII) by Arturo Perez-Reverte \n\n\n\n"}

Chadwick with a libretto by R. A. Barnet. At first titled \"Tabasco\", the opera was created without the knowledge of McIlhenny Company, maker of Tabasco brand pepper sauce since 1868. The company, however, subsequently approved its performance. The opera went on to tour the U.S. to critical acclaim, but disagreements between Chadwick and the musical's producer eventually derailed its success.\n\nA Boston volunteer militia, the First Corps of Cadets, commissioned Chadwick and Barnet to create the opera as a fundraiser for a new armory. The cadets themselves performed the musical for this charitable purpose. Soon, however, showman Thomas Q. Seabrooke — impressed by the opera's popularity — purchased the rights and renamed it the \"Burlesque Opera of Tabasco\" (\"burlesque\" in that era meaning \"comedic\")\n\nBecause Seabrooke intended to perform the opera commercially, he required, and obtained, the permission of McIlhenny Company to use its proprietary trademark. As part of its approval, however, McIlhenny Company required Seabrooke to pass out samples of Tabasco sauce during his productions. A giant papier-mâché Tabasco sauce bottle appeared on stage during the performance, and an image of the bottle showed up on the opera's published sheet music. So popular was Seabrooke's commercial production of the opera that “The Tabasco March,” the main theme composed by Chadwick, was issued in the form of a mechanical music box disk.\n\nThe opera centered on a Middle Eastern pasha who craved spicy food. Enraged by the blandness of fare provided by his royal kitchen, the pasha threatened to chop off the head of his French chef (actually a masquerading Irishman). The chef frantically searched the city for seasonings and ran into a blind beggar who gave him a mysterious potion. The concoction turned out to be Tabasco brand pepper sauce. Its piquant flavor satisfied the pasha and saved the day.\n\n\"Cast of singers:\"\n\n\n ACT I\n\nOverture\n\n1. Chorus (A) \"Dawning, the dawning, the Shadows westward fall\"\n\n2.

The library replaced the State Library of Ohio as the location for the Ohio Center for the Book in 2003.\n\nIn 1811, the idea behind the Cleveland Public Library came \"out of small beginnings\" when sixteen of Cleveland's sixty-four residents subscribed to its first library, established to distribute the rare printed book. The members read books such as the history of Rome, \"Lives of the English Poets\", Goldsmith's \"Greece\", and \"Don Quixote\". \n\nIn 1867, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Dayton Boards of Education petitioned the Ohio General Assembly for authority to levy a tax for the maintenance of free public libraries, permitting boards of education with populations over 20,000 to levy a tax of one-tenth of a mill for each dollar evaluation of their taxable property. Cleveland Superintendent, the Reverend Anson Smyth, who has been doubtfully called the \"father of the Cleveland Public Library,\" supported this law in his Superintendent position, helping in the laws' development.\n\nThe new law provided for a Cleveland library that was part of the school system, controlled by the Cleveland Board of Education throughout the first decade of the library's existence, except for the years 1871-1873.\n\nThe Cleveland Public Library opened on February 17, 1869 on the third floor of the Northup and Harrington Block on West Superior Avenue, The library room was adjacent to the Cleveland Board of Education, and opened with approximately 5,800 books.\n\nLuther Melville Oviatt was the first librarian at Cleveland Public Library from 1869 to 1875. During his first year, patrons borrowed 65,000 books. Forwarding thinking in his views, Oviatt wanted to provide books that would interest both children and adults, the mechanic, businessman, and scholar. He had open shelves because, \"without a catalog, the only way potential borrowers could ascertain what books were available was to look at them.\" Oviatt resigned in June, 1875, the victim of governing boards or their subsidiaries, who micromanaged daily operations of the library.\n\nLibrarian William Howard Brett opened the library's first stand-alone children's room on February 22, 1898. Effie Louise Power was appointed Cleveland's first children's librarian.\n\nIn 1915, the Cleveland architectural firm of Walker and Weeks won a competition to design a new library building. Construction of their classical Renaissance design, delayed by the First World War, began in 1923 under Linda Anne Eastman. Eastman (1867–1963) was the first woman to head a major U.S. city library system and a pioneer in the modern library system. She opened bookshelves to patrons, replacing the New York Public Library system in which a librarian fetched the books.\n\nThe Main Library consists of two buildings. The older wing, completed on May 6, 1925 and renovated between 1997 and 1999, has five stories, each as high as two stories in most buildings. The renovations included the restoration of a large mural painted by Ora Coltman in 1934 for the Federal Arts Project. The work was done by the Intermuseum Conservation Association.\n\nIn 1957, the library purchased the six-story Plain Dealer Building at 710 Superior Avenue (now the site of the Louis Stokes Wing). The library won passage in November 1957 of a $3 million bond levy to pay for the purchase of the building. The structure was purchased on December 22, 1957, and the new Business and Social Sciences Annex opened on August 24, 1959.\n\nThe annex was demolished in 1994 to make way for a second building, named after former Representative Louis Stokes, was dedicated on April 12, 1997. Stokes commented, \"This is the most beautiful that I have ever seen.\" The $65 million structure of fritted glass panels and Georgia marble housed eight million items and two million titles on its grand opening. The two buildings are connected by underground corridor below the Eastman Reading Garden, which was designed by landscape architecture firm OLIN, and includes sculptures by Maya Lin and Tom Otterness.\n\nThe Main Library's special collections include the Mears and Murdock baseball collections, the Cleveland Theater collection, the John G. White chess and checkers collection, a 130,000-volume children's collection, a 74,000-volume rare book collection, and collection of 1.3 million photographs.\n\nThe Cleveland Public Library had Sub-Branches (Stations) named Alliance, Alta House, Brooklyn, Detroit, Glenville, Hiram House, Lorain, Lorain-Clark, Prospect, South Brooklyn, Superior, and Temple.\nDuring the 1890s, William Howard Brett opened four self-contained branch libraries in leased buildings. As early as 1891, he asked Andrew Carnegie for building permanent structures, but the steel-mogul-turned-philanthropist refused the librarian's requests for 12 years. Brett persisted and in 1903 Carnegie donated $250,000 to build seven branches, including the Woodland Branch. Carnegie was so impressed with Brett's money management of the funds, he eventually increased the amount to $507,000, which built 15 branches-the foundation for what would become one of the largest branch systems in the United States. Children living in the city's poorest manufacturing districts could not visit the library downtown or the new branches, so William Howard Brett and Miss Eastman put small reading collections in neighborhood homes. By 1913, there were 57 \"home libraries\" in seven different working class districts, serving 11 different nationalities: Italian, Greek, Syrian, Polish, Bohemian, Hungarian, Slovak, Irish, German, Danish, and Norwegian.\nCurrently, the Cleveland Public Library has 27 neighborhood branches located throughout the city in addition to the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled:\n\n\nA Sensory Garden is also adjacent to the Ohio Library for the Blind and Physically Disabled. The garden was first organized in 1998 and was significantly enlarged the following year. The garden features plants specifically for the tactile sensations they provide and unique scents.\n\nIn 1933, William Sommer painted the Main Library's Brett Hall mural depicting Cleveland precisely a century earlier. Sommer had access to the original 1833 prints from which the present duplications were made; or he may have seen an earlier set of duplicates made in 1868 by Sandford and Hayward. \n\nThe portraits of former members of Congress Louis Stokes and Stephanie Jones Tubbs are housed at the Cleveland Public Library, painted by artist Khaz Ra'el.\n\nIn 2002, the Cleveland Public Library had annual attendance of 804,692 and an annual circulation of 1,698,928 items. In 2016, the library's collection totaled 10,557,336 items. The Cleveland Public Library is a member of CLEVNET, a consortium of 44 public libraries throughout northern Ohio. In 1947, it became a depository library for the United Nations Library network, holding documents for the state of Ohio. There are only 400 UN depository libraries worldwide.\n\nIn 2002, Northern Ohio library patrons had access to download digital books and periodicals through a new e-book system headquartered at Cleveland Public Library. The Clevnet consortium of libraries entered in a $50,000 setup-free agreement with the Cleveland-based company OverDrive to allow patrons to download text from e-books to their personal computer.\n\nIn 2012, the Library released a strategic plan focusing on communities of learning and preparing for its 150th anniversary in 2019.\n\nCleveland Public Library launched Tech Central on June 14, 2012, featuring a computer lab with 90 computers, tables encouraging collaboration, a 3D printer, and a MyCloud service. This $1 million launch was funded primarily through the Library's existing budgets, in which the MyCloud service was partially funded through corporate partners.\n\nCleveland Public Library, along with three other Ohio Libraries (Columbus, Toledo, and Cincinnati), opened digitization hubs, with $1 million in funding dispersed among them, funded by Ohio Public Library Information Network and the Library Services Technology Act. The digitization hub at Cleveland Public Library was named the Cleveland Digital Public Library and debuted February 14, 2015. As stated by Chatham Ewing, Cleveland Public Library's Digital Strategist, \"It's a way for us to strike up some partnerships with local organizations that have historical objects they are interested in stewarding and digitizing.\" \n\nIn 2018, Cleveland Public Library was designated an official Digital Access Partner with the Federal Depository Library Program for its digitized multi-volume set of the First United States Army Report of Operations during World War II.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The farm is near Steele's Tavern and Raphine, close to the northern border of Rockbridge and Augusta counties in the U.S. state of Virginia, and is currently a museum run by the Virginia Agricultural Experimental Station of Virginia Tech. The museum with free admission and covers of the initial farm.\n\nThe farm originally covered 532 acres with buildings centered on a scant 5 acres. On the farm eight out of the nine original buildings are still standing, many of which have been renovated since the farm was created in 1822 by Robert McCormick (1780–1846). The eight existing buildings include a grist mill, blacksmith shop, slave quarters, carriage house, manor house, smoke house, schoolroom, and housekeeper's quarters. In the original construction of the farm there was also an ice house which was demolished in the 1960s. Each of these different buildings played a specific role in the daily routine of the Cyrus McCormick farm. The grist mill, built prior to 1800, was used to grind wheat for flour. The blacksmith shop was used to build and repair all the farm implements needed by the McCormick family and was where Cyrus McCormick engineered his reaper. Slave quarters served as the home for the nine slaves that the McCormick family owned. Furthermore, the carriage house was used as a garage for the carriages and other wheeled vehicles. The manor house is centrally located on the farm and was constructed of brick in 1822, making it the first building on the McCormick farm. Behind the brick manor house was the smoke house where meat was dried and smoked to preserve it through the winter. Refrigeration was not introduced until the late 19th century. The McCormick family also maintained a school on their property for neighboring children.\n\nThe McCormick Farm at Walnut Grove is known as the birthplace of the mechanical reaper, the predecessor to the combine harvester. Cyrus McCormick reportedly designed, built, and tested his reaper all within six weeks at Walnut Grove, although the design may have been merely an improvement upon the similar device developed by his father and his brother Leander over 20 years. Shortly after constructing his first reaper he went on to harvest his first crop with it later that year. After building his first reaper, Cyrus constantly went back to the drawing board to revise and improve his basic design, coming out with new models almost every decade.\n\nAfter his father's death, Cyrus McCormick moved his base of operations from Rockbridge County, Virginia to Chicago, Illinois in 1847 because of the fertile prairie soil in the midwestern United States. In 1859, Cyrus was joined by his brothers Leander James McCormick and William Sanderson McCormick to form the company Cyrus H. McCormick and Brothers. By the end of the 19th century, McCormick's company had built a primitive combine, which could harvest grain even faster and cheaper than older reapers. Prior to inventing the reaper, farmers could only harvest a day; after the reaper was invented, farmers could harvest a day using less manual labor. The mechanical reaper did not require a family to toil all day to harvest crops. Instead, a single farmer merely operated the machine and the reaper would do the rest of the work. His work in mechanical reapers and harvesting techniques allowed farmers to cultivate plots of land bigger than ever thought possible.\nIn 1902, the company was merged with competitor Deering Harvester Company and (smaller ones) to form International Harvester.\n\nThe farm remained in the McCormick family up to 1954, before being donated to Virginia Polytechnical Institute as an agricultural center and Farm Memorial. Currently, the schoolroom has vintage textbooks, toys, and other school supplies dating from the 1830s. \nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964.\nThe farm is less than from the interchange of Raphine Road and Interstate 81, halfway between Lexington, Virginia and Staunton, Virginia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32714470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32714470", "title": "Data monetization", "text": "Data monetization\n\nData monetization, a form of monetization, may refer to the act of generating measurable economic benefits from available data sources (analytics). Less commonly, it may also refer to the act of monetizing data services. In the case of analytics, typically, these benefits accrue as revenue or expense savings, but may also include market share or corporate market value gains. Data monetization leverages data generated through business operations, available exogenous data or content, as well as data associated with individual actors such as that collected via electronic devices and sensors participating in the internet of things. For example, the ubiquity of the internet of things is generating location data and other data from sensors and mobile devices at an ever-increasing rate. When this data is collated against traditional databases, the value and utility of both sources of data increases, leading to tremendous potential to mine data for social good, research and discovery, and achievement of business objectives. Closely associated with data monetization are the emerging data as a service models for transactions involving data by the data item.\n\nThere are three ethical and regulatory vectors involved in data monetization due to the sometimes conflicting interests of actors involved in the digital supply chain. The individual data creator who generates files and records through his own efforts or owns a device such as a sensor or a mobile phone that generates data has a claim to ownership of data. The business entity that generates data in the course of its operations, such as its transactions with financial institutions or risk factors discovered through feedback from customers also has a claim on data captured through their systems and platforms. However, the person that contributed the data may also have a legitimate claim on the data. Internet platforms and service providers, such as Google or Facebook that require a user to forgo some ownership interest in their data in exchange for use of the platform also have a legitimate claim on the data. Thus the practice of data monetization, although common since 2000, is now getting increasing attention from regulators. The European Union and the United States Congress have begun to address these issues. For instance, in the financial services industry, regulations involving data are included in the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act and Dodd-Frank. Some individual creators of data are shifting to using personal data vaults and implementing vendor relationship management concepts as a reflection of an increasing resistance to their data being federated or aggregated and resold without compensation. Groups such as the Personal Data Ecosystem Consortium, Patient privacy rights, and others are also challenging corporate cooptation of data without compensation.\n\nFinancial services companies are a relatively good example of an industry focused on generating revenue by leveraging data. Credit card issuers and retail banks use customer transaction data to improve targeting of cross-sell offers. Partners are increasingly promoting merchant based reward programs which leverage a bank’s data and provide discounts to customers at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a wide variety of industries, firms and business models related to data monetization. The following frameworks have been offered to help understand the types of business models that are used:\n\nRoger Ehrenberg of IA Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in this sector, has defined three basic types of data product firms:\nSelvanathan and Zuk offer a framework that includes \"monetization methods that are outside the bounds of the traditional value capture systems employed by an enterprise... tuned to match the context and consumption models for the target customer.\" They offer examples of \"four distinct approaches: platforms, applications, data-as-a-service, and professional services.\"\n\n\nSome of the patents issued since 2010 by the USPTO for monetizing data generated by individuals include; 8,271,346, 8,612,307, 8,560,464, 8,510,176, and 7,860,760. These are usually in class 705 related to electronic commerce, data processing, and cost and price determination. Some of these patents use the term, the data supply chain to reflect emerging technology to federate and aggregate data in real time from many individuals and devices linked together through the internet of things. Another emerging term is information banking.\n\nAn unexplored but potentially disruptive arena for data monetization is the use of Bitcoin micropayments for data transactions. Because Bitcoins are emerging as competitors with payment services like Visa or PayPal that can readily enable and reduce or eliminate transaction costs, transactions for as little as a single data item can be facilitated. Consumers, as well as enterprises who desire to monetize their participation in a data supply chain, may soon be able to access social network enabled Bitcoin exchanges and platforms. Clickbait and data hijacking may wither as micropayments for data are ubiquitous and enabled. Potentially, even the current need to build out data broker managed data trading exchanges may be bypassed. Stanley Smith, who introduced the notion of the data supply chain, has said that simple micropayments for data monetization are the key to evolution of ubiquitous implementation of user configurable data supply schemata, enabling data monetization on a universal scale for all data creators, including the burgeoning internet of things.\n\n"}

The surrounding park – Anna and Erazm Jerzmanowski Park – was named after its owners.\n\nIn his last will Jerzmanowski presented all his wealth to Academy of Learning in Kraków. He ordered the Academy to establish the foundation and the award named after him and his wife. People distinguished with Jerzmanowscy Award had to be Polish Roman Catholics who had served Poland with their artistic, scientific or social activities.

This documentary, narrated by Heydon Prowse is called \"The Town that went Offshore\" or \"The Town That Took on the Taxman\" and was first shown in January 2016. \n\nThe movie follows the business owners as they decide to establish an untaxed Manx company which designs and owns a brand (\"Crickhowell Fair Tax\"), use the brand in their advertising and pay royalties for using this brand, as big companies do with their own brands. Their Manx company sets up a Dutch subsidiary which receives the royalties and sends them to the Isle of Man, since Britain would tax royalties sent directly to a tax haven, but charges no tax on royalty payments to the Netherlands, and the Netherlands charges no tax on royalties sent to tax havens. Thus their money accumulates tax-free in the Isle of Man, and the movie suggests ways to use it for expenses in Wales, such as borrowing it. The movie also discusses customer relationship managers which tax authorities assign to big businesses to ensure their tax arrangements are valid.\n\nThe movement's aim is to persuade governments to change their tax regulation so that small businesses get the same level of tax as multinationals and other large businesses. To help achieve this, FTT has started to share their expertise on how to make businesses engage in tax avoidance. Since then, many other towns have adopted the scheme.\n\nAfter spending two years developing and publicizing the project, the Crickhowell businesses decided not to proceed. Prowse, the documentarian, said he hoped another group of people would take the idea another step, \"If you want to put your money through a scheme like that, you’ve got to expect that the taxman’s going to contact you and you’re going to have to defend yourself, possibly in court.\"\n\n"}

Heinz founded the company in the nineteenth century, and he worked in a variety of positions within the company before becoming CEO.\n\nHeinz II was the father of John Heinz, elected as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, who died in a plane crash in 1991.\n\nHeinz was born in Pittsburgh to Howard Covode Heinz and Elizabeth Granger (Rust) Heinz. His grandfather Henry J. Heinz had founded the H. J. Heinz Company, and his father worked for the company for decades, becoming president after the founder died.\n\nHeinz II was educated at Choate, and graduated from Yale University, where he was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society. He also earned a degree from Oxford University. During the summers, he worked for his father's Heinz Company in the pickling and salting stations, as bookkeeper and as handyman. He later joined the sales force in England.\n\nHeinz had some early political experience. He served as the Pittsburgh Fire Bureau Chief from 1935 until 1936, and then as Allegheny County Sheriff for Pittsburgh from 1938 until 1942.\n\nHeinz married Joan Diehl, a pioneer aviator, in 1935. They were the parents of one son, H.J. Heinz III. They established their home, Rosemont Farm, in the Fox Chapel suburb of Pittsburgh. The couple divorced in 1942.\n\nIn 1953, Heinz married Drue Maher, with whom he shared a love of philanthropy, skiing, art collecting and world travel.\n\nHeinz started work early in his grandfather's company, learning every aspect of the business. In 1941, he advanced to become president of the Heinz Company upon his father's death of a stroke.\n\nHe led the company through the challenges of World War II. For a time the Heinz plant in Pittsburgh was converted to producing gliders for the War Department. He made five trips to England during the war: once to see about the bombed Heinz plant in Harlesden, and several times by request of the British government to assist with relieving its food shortages. He also aided the Netherlands with their food challenges.\n\nAs chairman of the United War Fund, Heinz routinely gave speeches in the Pittsburgh region and elsewhere about food conservation, rationing, and allocations. After the war, he served as chairman of the Community Chest in Pittsburgh, which became the United Way, a national organization with chapters across the country.\n\nAs president of the Heinz Company, Jack launched subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Portugal, Venezuela, Japan, and Italy, establishing a large international network. Acquisitions of Star-Kist Foods Inc. and Ore-Ida Foods Inc. are considered the hallmarks of his tenure. He also presided over the opening of a baby food plant on mainland China.\n\nIn 1966, Heinz resigned as president and CEO. For the first time in company history, a non-family member, R. Burt Goodkin, was chosen as CEO to manage day-to-day operations. Heinz served as chairman of the board from 1966 until his death.\n\nAfter the war, Heinz teamed up with Richard King Mellon and Pittsburgh mayor David Lawrence for Renaissance I, a plan to improve and modernize Pittsburgh. Redevelopment included smoke-control ordinances to clear the air of smoke and soot from the steel mills. This also helped improve water quality in the city's rivers, for which additional environmental laws were passed.\n\nHeinz was the driving force for the creation of downtown Pittsburgh's Cultural District, a major legacy of his work as a philanthropist and community leader. He was the first chairman of the Heinz Endowments, serving from 1941 until his death in 1987. One of his early projects was the conversion and restoration of Lowe's Penn Theater to the current Heinz Hall, home of the Pittsburgh Symphony.\n\nHeinz was one of the original investors in the city's effort to win an NHL franchise, becoming part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins from 1967 until the early 1970s.\n\nA lifelong Republican, Heinz chaired the U.S. arm of the International Chamber of Commerce from 1948-1951. He was tapped by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to head a special aid mission to assess the effectiveness of an emergency economic aid program to Pakistan. He also chaired the U.S. delegation to a Economic Commission for Europe in 1958 and 1959. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.\n\nIn 1979, Queen Elizabeth II made Heinz an Honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, citing him \"for significant contribution in the furtherance of British-American relationships, especially in the cultural, educational and economic fields.\"\n\nHe received decorations from Italy, France, and Greece.\n\nOn 23 February 1987, Henry John Heinz II died of cancer at the family's winter home in Hobe Sound, Florida, at the age of 78.\n"}

Kennedy Jr. (Ted Jr.) (b. 1961), and Patrick J. Kennedy (b. 1967).\n\nTwo of their children were cancer victims. Ted Jr. developed bone cancer at age 12, which resulted in the removal of a portion of his right leg in 1973, and Kara was treated for lung cancer in 2003. Daughter Kara Kennedy died of a heart attack at age 51 on September 16, 2011.\n\nTed suffered a severe back injury in a 1964 airplane crash while campaigning for his first full Senate term. She assumed the full campaign-appearance schedule for his successful re-election in 1964. He had earlier won a special election in November 1962 to serve out the final two years of his brother John's Senate six year term; John had resigned from the U.S. Senate upon his November 1960 election as the 35th U.S. President.\n\nIn July 1969, Ted Kennedy was involved in a car accident at a bridge off Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts that resulted in the death of his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Although pregnant and confined to bed in the wake of two previous miscarriages, Joan attended Kopechne's funeral. Three days later, she stood beside her husband in a local court when he pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. She suffered a third miscarriage shortly thereafter.\n\nThe couple separated in 1978 after twenty years of marriage. She subsequently told \"McCall's\" magazine about her alcoholism and her work to stay sober. They remained together officially married during his failed 1980 U.S. presidential campaign, later announcing plans to divorce in 1981; the divorce was finalized in 1983.\n\nIn 1992, she published the book \"The Joy of Classical Music: A Guide for You and Your Family\". Kennedy has worked with children's charities, remains an accomplished pianist and has taught classical music to children.\n\nKennedy's later years have been shaped by chronic alcoholism, which had developed during her marriage. The alcohol problem escalated with sporadic, uneven sobriety, repeated drunk-driving arrests, court-ordered rehabilitation, and a return to drinking. This ultimately led to kidney damage, with the possibility of dialysis and protracted complications. In July 2004, her son, Ted Jr., had been appointed her legal guardian; in 2005, her children were granted temporary guardianship. That year, she was hospitalized with a concussion and a broken shoulder after being found lying in a Boston street near her home. In 2005, she requested that her second cousin, financial planner Webster E. Janssen of Connecticut, establish a trust to control her estate. This was in violation of her sons' guardianship. Her children later took successful legal action against Janssen, removing him as trustee and later filing a complaint against him with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That October, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent surgery. She agreed to strict court-ordered guardianship and her estate has since been placed in a new trust overseen by two court-appointed trustees.\n\nApart from a brief relationship shortly after her divorce, she has neither remarried nor pursued another relationship. She attended Ted's funeral at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port. As of 2005, she resides in Boston, Massachusetts, and Cape Cod.\n\n\n\n"}

Kennedy Jr.\n\nJoseph Patrick Kennedy Jr. (July 25, 1915 – August 12, 1944) was a United States Navy lieutenant. He was killed in action during World War II while serving as a land-based patrol bomber pilot, and was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. He was the eldest of nine children born to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. (1888–1969) and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy (1890–1995). He was the only Kennedy son who never sought political office, though he had planned to.\n\nJoe Sr. had aspirations for Joe Jr. to become president. However, Joe Jr. was killed while participating in a top-secret mission in 1944, and the high expectations of the father then fell upon Joe Jr.'s younger brother John, who was later elected president.\n\nKennedy was born in Hull, Massachusetts. He first attended the Dexter School in Brookline, Massachusetts, with his brother, John. In 1933, he graduated from the Choate School in Wallingford, Connecticut. He then entered Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, graduating in 1938. Kennedy participated in football, rugby, and crew, and he served on the student council. Kennedy then spent a year studying under the tutelage of Harold Laski at the London School of Economics before enrolling in Harvard Law School.\n\nFrom a very young age, Kennedy was groomed by his father and predicted to be the first Roman Catholic president of the United States. When he was born, his grandfather John F. Fitzgerald, then Mayor of Boston, told the news, \"This child is the future President of the nation.\" He often boasted that he would be president even without help from his father. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940. Kennedy planned to run for the U.S. House from Massachusetts's 11th congressional district in 1946.\n\nKennedy expressed approval of Adolf Hitler before his conquest of Europe began. His father sent him to visit Nazi Germany in 1934. He wrote to his father, praising Hitler's sterilization policy as \"a great thing\" that \"will do away with many of the disgusting specimens of men.\" He explained that \"Hitler is building a spirit in his men that could be envied in any country.\"\n\nKennedy left before his final year of law school at Harvard to enlist in the U.S. Naval Reserve on June 24, 1941. He entered flight training to be a Naval Aviator, and after training, he received his wings and was commissioned an ensign on May 5, 1942. He was assigned to Patrol Squadron 203 and then Bombing Squadron 110. In September 1943, he was sent to Britain and became a member of Bomber Squadron 110, Special Air Unit ONE, in 1944. He piloted land-based PB4Y Liberator patrol bombers on anti-submarine details during two tours of duty in the winter of 1943–1944. Kennedy had completed 25 combat missions and was eligible to return home. He instead volunteered for an Operation Aphrodite mission.\n\nOperation Aphrodite (U.S. Army Air Corps) & Operation Anvil (U.S. Navy) made use of unmanned, explosive-laden Army Air Corps Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Navy Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberator bombers that were deliberately crashed into their targets under radio control. These aircraft could not take off safely on their own, so a crew of two would take off and fly to before activating the remote control system, arming the detonators, and parachuting from the aircraft.\n\nKennedy was appointed a Lieutenant on July 1, 1944. After the U.S. Army Air Corps operation missions were drawn up on July 23, 1944, Lieutenants Wilford John Willy and Kennedy were designated as the first Navy flight crew. Willy, who was the executive officer of Special Air Unit ONE, had also volunteered for the mission and \"pulled rank\" over Ensign James Simpson, who was Kennedy's regular co-pilot. Kennedy and Willy (co-pilot) flew a BQ-8 \"robot\" aircraft (drone; a converted B-24 Liberator) for the U.S. Navy's first Aphrodite mission. Two Lockheed Ventura mother planes and a Boeing B-17 navigation plane took off from RAF Fersfield at 1800 on August 12, 1944. Then the BQ-8 aircraft, loaded with of Torpex, took off. It was to be used against the U-boat pens at Heligoland in the North Sea.\n\nFollowing them in a USAAF F-8 Mosquito to film the mission were pilot Lt. Robert A. Tunnel and combat camera man Lt. David J. McCarthy, who filmed the event from the perspex nose of the aircraft. As planned, Kennedy and Willy remained aboard as the BQ-8 completed its first remote-controlled turn at near the North Sea coast. Kennedy and Willy removed the safety pin, arming the explosive package, and Kennedy radioed the agreed code \"Spade Flush\", his last known words. Two minutes later (and well before the planned crew bailout, near RAF Manston), the Torpex explosive detonated prematurely and destroyed the Liberator, killing Kennedy and Willy instantly. Wreckage landed near the village of Blythburgh in Suffolk, England, causing widespread damage and small fires, but there were no injuries on the ground. According to one report, a total of 59 buildings were damaged in a nearby coastal town.\n\nAccording to USAAF records, the trailing Mosquito \"was flying 300 feet above and about 300 yards to the rear of the robot. Engineer photographer on this ship was injured, and the ship was damaged slightly by the explosion.\" The Mosquito, which made an immediate emergency landing at RAF Halesworth, belonged to the 325th Reconnaissance Wing, a unit under the command of the son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Colonel Elliott Roosevelt. Years later, Roosevelt claimed to have been aboard this trailing aircraft, and his version of the event has gained wide currency. However, Air Force records cannot substantiate this. Instead, an after-action account by the 8th Combat Camera Unit (CCU) noted that:\n\nThe 8th CCU film of the event, has, so far as is known, not been found.\nThe 20th Fighter Group out of King's Cliffe was tasked with providing escort to the Aphrodite mission. Escort consisted of P-51s out of the 55th and 79th Fighter Squadrons, each squadron provided two aircraft. VIII FC, Field Order 509 stated \"20 GP (P-51's, 4 A/C) will proceed to Fersfield and land coordinating with operations where to provide close escort support to one B-34 special Operation.\"\n\nLt John E. Klink reported in this mission summary report \"Took off to excort BXXX, 1 B24, 1 B17, 2 B34s, and 3 photo Recons (2 Mosq. -1 P38). When specially loaded B24 was at approx.. 2000 ft. NE of Ipswich it exploded and crashed near small lake. No one got out of of the plane. Rest of ships OK in spite of terrific concussion from explosion. All returned to base.\" [Sic]\n\nThe Navy's informal board of review, discussing a number of theories, discounted the possibility of the crew making a mistake or that suspected jamming or a stray signal could have armed and detonated the explosives. An electronics officer, Earl Olsen, who believed the wiring harness had a design defect, had warned Kennedy of this possibility the day before the mission, but he was ignored. Kennedy and Willy were both posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, the Air Medal, and the Purple Heart Medal.\n\nThe names of both men are listed on the Tablets of the Missing at the Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial, a cemetery and chapel near the village of Madingley in Cambridgeshire, Britain, that commemorates American servicemen who died in World War II.\nLater reports that Kennedy's final mission were kept top secret until many years later are negated by a detailed public account of the operation and Kennedy's death released in 1945.\n\nKennedy's military decorations and awards include:\n\nIn 1946, the Navy named a destroyer for Kennedy, the , aboard which his younger brother, (future U.S. Senator) Robert F. Kennedy, briefly served. Among the highlights of its service are the blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the afloat recovery teams for \"Gemini 6\" and \"Gemini 7\", both 1965 manned spaceflights in NASA's Gemini program. It is now a floating museum in Battleship Cove, Fall River, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1947, the Kennedys established the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation and funded the construction of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Memorial Hall at Boston College, now a part of Campion Hall and home to the college's Lynch School of Education. The foundation was led by his youngest brother, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, until his death in August 2009. In 1957, the Lieutenant Joseph Patrick Kennedy Junior Memorial Skating Rink was opened in Hyannis, Massachusetts, with funds from the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation.\n\nIn 1969, Hank Searls wrote a biography of Joe Jr., entitled \"The Lost Prince: Young Joe, the Forgotten Kennedy\". A television movie based on Searls' book won a primetime Emmy in 1977.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "651268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=651268", "title": "Lamar Odom", "text": "Lamar Odom\n\nLamar Joseph Odom (born November 6, 1979) is an American retired professional basketball player. As a member of the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA), he won NBA championships in 2009 and 2010 and was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2011.\n\nAs a high school player, Odom received national player of the year honors from \"Parade\" in 1997. He played college basketball for the University of Rhode Island, earning all-conference honors in his only season in the Atlantic 10 Conference. He was drafted in the first round of the 1999 NBA draft with the fourth overall pick by the Los Angeles Clippers. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team, but twice he violated the league's drug policy in his four seasons with the Clippers. He signed as a restricted free agent with the Miami Heat, where he played one season in 2003–04 before being traded to the Lakers. Odom spent seven seasons with the Lakers, who traded him to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. After the move, his career declined. He was traded back to the Clippers in 2012 and played briefly in Spain in 2014.\n\nOdom played on the United States national team, winning a bronze medal in the Olympics in 2004 and a gold medal in the FIBA World Championship (known later as the World Cup) in 2010.\n\nOdom was married to Khloé Kardashian from 2009 to 2016. During their marriage, Odom made several appearances on the reality television show, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\". He and Kardashian also had their own reality series, \"Khloé & Lamar\".\n\nIn October 2015, Odom fell into a coma and was hospitalized with life-threatening medical problems. Odom has since recovered from his health scare and obtained drug treatment.\n\nOdom was born in South Jamaica, Queens, New York City, to Joe Odom and Cathy Mercer. His father was a heroin addict, and Odom's mother died of colon cancer when he was twelve years old. At her deathbed, Odom's mom told him: \"Be nice to everybody\". Afterwards, he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mildred Mercer.\n\nIn his first three years of high school, Odom played for Christ The King Regional High School in Middle Village, Queens. He left the school at the start of his senior year due to poor grades, transferring first to Redemption Christian Academy in Troy, New York and then to the now-defunct St. Thomas Aquinas High School in New Britain, Connecticut, where he was coached by Jerry DeGregorio. As a senior, Odom was recognized nationally as the \"Parade\" Player of the Year in 1997. He also was named to the \"Parade\" All-American First Team for the second consecutive year, and earned \"USA Today\" All-USA 1st Team honors. During his youth, Odom was teamed with future NBA players Elton Brand and Ron Artest (later known as Metta World Peace)--each of whom would become teammates with Odom in the NBA--on the same AAU team, and played with future Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant at Adidas ABCD camps. Adidas executive Sonny Vaccaro commented at the time that Odom possessed a \"$2 million smile\".\n\nOdom contemplated entering the NBA directly out of high school, and consulted with Bryant, who had made the jump a year earlier. He decided he was not ready, and decided to attend the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. However, after a \"Sports Illustrated\" report questioned his unexpectedly high score of 22 out of 36 in the ACT, the school released him in July 1997 before he ever played a game for them. That same summer, he received a citation for soliciting prostitution following an undercover operation by the Las Vegas police. Later, an NCAA inquiry found Odom received payments amounting to $5,600 from booster David Chapman. Coach Bill Bayno was fired and UNLV was placed on probation for four years.\n\nOdom transferred to the University of Rhode Island but was forced to sit out the 1997–98 season. He was admitted as a non-matriculating student, and was not allowed to play intramural basketball. His room and board was paid for by his father, who was covered by the G.I. Bill. After two semesters and a summer session, Odom earned his eligibility to play basketball. His career at Rhode Island had been in jeopardy after the first semester, when he vanished before finals. However, Rhode Island coach Jim Harrick persuaded three of his four instructors to allow him to make up his work. The coach also had Odom work with DeGregorio, who had become a Rams assistant and was the player's closest friend in college. Odom was also inspired by his maternal grandmother, a nurse who had raised five children and returned to school to earn her degree in 1980 at age 56.\n\nOdom played one season for the Rams in the Atlantic 10 Conference, where he averaged 17.6 points per game and led the Rams to the conference championship in 1999. He earned first-team all-conference honors and was named the Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Year. He was named the most valuable player of the Atlantic 10 Tournament after his three-pointer against Temple University at the buzzer gave the Rams their first A-10 Tournament title.\n\nOdom declared his eligibility for the 1999 NBA draft after his freshman year at the Rhode Island in 1999. He then tried to return to college, thinking he was not ready for the NBA; however, had already signed with an agent and was no longer eligible to withdraw from the draft. Odom was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers with the fourth overall pick. In his first season with the Clippers, Odom averaged 16.6 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game, including 30 points and 12 rebounds in his NBA debut. He was named to the 2000 NBA All-Rookie First Team.\n\nIn the 2000–01 season, Odom increased his scoring average to 17.2 points a game as he started in 74 games. The Clippers failed to make the playoffs again however, as the young team could not improve their positioning in the Western Conference. In March 2001, Odom was suspended for five games for violating the NBA's drug policy. In the following season, he was suspended in November for violating the drug policy again, his second offense in eight months. He admitted to using marijuana after the suspension. Odom only played 29 games during the season, and his production slipped.\n\nHe would only play in 49 games during the 2002–03 season, and would be a restricted free agent the following summer. The Miami Heat offered a deal that the Clippers declined to match after already matching another offer the Heat made to Elton Brand.\n\nThe Heat had previously won only 25 games, but had drafted young talent such as Dwyane Wade and Caron Butler. Odom was brought in to play as the team's starting power forward, and along with the budding Wade and veteran Eddie Jones shared the scoring load with 17.1 points a game to go with a career high 9.7 rebounds. The Heat opened the season losing 7 straight games, but ended up playing better and competing for a seed in the playoffs. On March 6, Odom posted a triple double, scoring 30 points with 19 rebounds and 11 assists in a home win against the Sacramento Kings. The Heat would go on to the clinch the 4th seed in the playoffs, facing off the New Orleans Hornets in the first round. Each team won at home, and the Heat would win a 7th deciding game to advance to the second round to face the number one seeded Indiana Pacers. The Pacers would win the first two games in Indiana, but the Heat responded with two straight home wins, including a game 4 victory led by Odom's 22 points. The Pacers' experience proved to be too much for the younger Heat, as they would go to win games 5 and 6 to wrap up the series. He had a solid season compared to his sub-par season with the Clippers the previous year.\n\nAfter the season, Odom was traded in a package with Caron Butler and Brian Grant to the Los Angeles Lakers for All-Star Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nIn his first year with the Los Angeles Lakers, Odom incurred a left shoulder injury which forced him to miss the end of the 2004–05 season. Despite Odom averaging 15.2 points and a career high 10.2 rebounds, the Lakers finished out of the playoffs for only the 5th time in franchise history. Following the 2004–05 season, they re-hired former coach Phil Jackson.\n\nIn the first half of 2005–06, Odom displayed inconsistency while playing with the Lakers. However, as Los Angeles progressed towards the end of the season, his performance steadily improved. Along the way, he posted consecutive triple-doubles for the first time as a Laker against the Golden State Warriors and Portland Trail Blazers. The Lakers were eliminated in 7 games in the first round of the playoffs against the Phoenix Suns, after the Lakers lost a 3–1 series lead. Odom averaged 14.8 points and 9.2 rebounds during the season and increased his scoring (19.1) and rebounds (11) in seven playoff games.\n\nBattling injuries, Odom was limited to 56 games in 2006–07, but finished with an average of 15.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. In a rematch of the previous year's series, the Lakers were again defeated by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs.\n\nAfter young center Andrew Bynum went down with a knee injury during the 2007–08 season, and Pau Gasol was acquired by the Lakers midseason, Odom played well, averaging 15.3 points, 12 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. Odom finished the season with 14.2 ppg 10.6 rpg and 3.5 apg. Odom's numbers were down in the Finals, however, where he averaged 13.5 points, 9.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game, with the Lakers losing in the 2008 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics.\n\nIn 2008–09, Odom arrived at training camp out of shape. Jackson shared his plan to move Odom to the bench as their sixth man, backing up the Lakers' frontcourt of Gasol, Bynum, and Trevor Ariza. A free agent after the season, Odom initially balked at the plan to be a reserve for the first time in his career. However, he came around, and was resolved to make his teammates happy and sacrifice his own individual numbers in the hopes of securing his first NBA championship. When Bynum was injured in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies in January, Odom returned to the starting lineup. In the month of February, Odom, playing 36 minutes per game, averaged 16.5 points, 13.4 rebounds (4.9 offensive and 9.5 defensive), 2.4 assists, 1.4 blocks, and .9 steals. The February run included a good performance at Quicken Loans Arena at Cleveland. With 15 points in the 3rd quarter, Odom helped the Lakers out of a 12-point deficit to turn it into a 10-point victory, breaking Cleveland's 23 game home win-streak. He finished the game with 28 points, 17 rebounds and 2 assists.\nOdom adjusted back to his sixth man role when Bynum returned for an April 9 home matchup versus the Denver Nuggets. Odom finished his season with 11.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.7 blocks with 29.7 minutes per game. He won his first NBA championship when the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals.\n\nDuring the 2009 off-season, Odom was courted heavily by his former team, Miami. Despite pleas from Heat guard Dwyane Wade, and Heat Executive Pat Riley, Kobe Bryant remained optimistic Odom would return to Los Angeles to team up with newly acquired forward and Odom's fellow New Yorker, Ron Artest. After a month of tedious negotiations, on July 31, 2009 the Lakers announced that they had agreed to a four-year deal worth up to $33 million with Odom. The investment would pay off as Odom would play a crucial role for the Lakers on the way to another NBA Championship, with the Lakers winning over the Boston Celtics in the 2010 NBA Finals.\n\nOdom continued his strong play for the Lakers with another solid season in the 2010–11 season where he posted career highs in 3 point shooting percentage (.382) and overall field goal percentage (.530). He started 35 games in Bynum's absence during the season and averaged 16.3 points and 10.2 rebounds in those starts. In 47 games off the bench, Odom averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds in 28.4 minutes. Meeting the requirement to come in as a reserve more games than he started, Odom was awarded the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first player in Lakers history to do so. Bryant called it Odom's most \"consistent season\". \n\nDuring the offseason, Odom considered taking a break from basketball after a close cousin was murdered and Odom was a passenger in a SUV involved in an accident that killed a teenage cyclist. The car accident had occurred the day after Odom attended his cousin's funeral.\n\nOn December 11, 2011, Odom was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the defending NBA champions, for a first-round draft pick and an $8.9 million trade exception after NBA Commissioner David Stern vetoed a proposed three-team trade that would have sent Odom and Houston Rockets teammates Kevin Martin, Luis Scola, and Goran Dragić to the New Orleans Hornets; Chris Paul to the Lakers; and Pau Gasol to the Houston Rockets. Odom felt \"disrespected\" after he learned of the Hornets trade publicly, and he requested a trade from the Lakers to another contending team. The Lakers were also concerned that Odom's contract was pricey since he was not needed to initiate the triangle offense with Mike Brown replacing Phil Jackson as Lakers coach.\n\nIn January 2012, Sports Illustrated reported that \"Odom [had] yet to find his niche in Dallas. His struggles [made] him a frequent target of [Mavericks coach Rick] Carlisle, who [harped] on Odom's need to understand the coverages, be more alert, communicate and get in better shape... Team sources say Odom...appeared stressed by what they believe [was] the mental burden of an overwhelming offseason.\" On March 2, 2012, Odom was assigned to the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. He had missed the prior three games due to personal reasons. His stint with the Legends was canceled on March 3, 2012, and he returned to the Mavs' active roster. On March 24, Odom did not play in a 104–87 loss to the San Antonio Spurs; this was the first time he could remember not playing due to a coach's decision.\n\nOn April 9, 2012, it was announced that Odom had parted ways with the Mavericks. Instead of releasing him, the team listed Odom as inactive for the remainder of the season. The move allowed the Mavericks to trade him at the end of the season. In a statement to ESPN, Odom said, \"I'm sorry that things didn't work out better for both of us, but I wish the Mavs' organization, my teammates and Dallas fans nothing but continued success in the defense of their championship.\" Mavericks owner Mark Cuban admitted that a clash between the two during halftime in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies on April 7 was the last straw. Odom reportedly responded angrily when Cuban questioned his commitment, asking if he was \"in or out.\" Odom averaged only 6.6 points in 20.5 minutes along with career lows in shooting percentage (35.2), rebounds (4.2) and assists (1.7) .\n\nOn June 29, 2012, Odom was traded back to the Los Angeles Clippers as part of a four-team deal. The deal sent Odom to the Clippers, the rights to Tadija Dragićević and cash considerations to the Dallas Mavericks, Mo Williams and the draft rights to Shan Foster to the Utah Jazz, and the draft rights to Furkan Aldemir to the Houston Rockets. He played all 82 games of the season for the third time in his career, but only started two of them. Out of shape for half the season, he averaged career lows of 4.0 ppg and 1.7 apg in 19.7 mpg during the season. He also averaged 5.9 rebounds, but shot just 39.9 percent. The Clippers finished 56-26 and won their first-ever Pacific Division title.\n\nIn July 2013, Odom became a free agent, but did not land an NBA contract despite some interest from the Clippers in his return. The Lakers also contemplated re-signing him, but both teams committed to other players instead.\n\nOn February 18, 2014, Odom signed with Laboral Kutxa Baskonia of the Spanish League and the Euroleague on a two-month deal with an option to extend it for the remainder of the season. A month later, he returned to the United States due to a back injury after his personal doctors in New York ruled him unfit to play out his contract. He appeared in just two games for Baskonia.\n\nOn April 16, 2014, Odom signed with the New York Knicks for the remainder of the 2013–14 season, but did not appear in the team's season finale. The Knicks finished with a 37–45 win/loss record and missed the playoffs. On July 11, 2014, he was waived by the Knicks.\n\nOdom played in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens for the US national team, averaging 9.3 ppg while helping the U.S. to a bronze medal. He was invited to play for the FIBA World Championships for 2006 but declined the invitation because of the tragic death of his son and in 2007 because of a shoulder injury.\n\nOdom would, however, be invited back for the national team's run at the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Istanbul, Turkey where the U.S. would win gold for the first time since 1994. Odom, being one of the elder statesmen on a young U.S. squad, served as a mentor for many of the younger players and even played out of position at center for the tournament. He led the U.S. in rebounds and finished the FIBA championships with double-doubles in the semi-final and championship games while becoming the first player in history to win both an NBA championship and FIBA gold in the same year.\n\nOdom was renowned for the impact his positive personality had on his teams. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak called him \"the most popular player in our locker room\". Odom valued the concept of a team and played unselfishly, and was content deferring to teammates while playing a supporting role. Standing at , he was still adept at dribbling the ball and directing the offense, and could also rebound proficiently as a small forward. He was able to score as a post player, on mid-range jumpers, as well as from outside. He could start a fast break with an outlook pass, finish it with a layup, or simply drive from coast to coast for a dunk. Though he was a reserve on the Lakers championship teams, he typically finished games in place of starter Andrew Bynum.\n\nOdom was cooperative with the media, and provided both thoughtful and open responses.\n\nOdom had three children, Destiny (b. 1998), Lamar Jr. (b. 2002) and Jayden (2005–2006), with Liza Morales before they separated. On June 29, 2006, 6½-month-old Jayden died from sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping in his crib in New York. At the time, Odom was already in town for the funeral of an aunt. Odom developed a relationship with his father, who became drug-free; however, he remains closer to his high school coach, Jerry DeGregorio, who he calls [his] \"white dad\". DeGregorio is the godfather to Destiny and Lamar Jr.\n\nIn September 2009, Odom married Khloé Kardashian after a month of dating. He had met her at a party for Lakers teammate Artest. Their wedding was featured on the E! reality-based series \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\", in which she stars. Odom became a fixture on the show and a household name to millions who were not already familiar with him as a basketball player. In December 2010, E! announced another spinoff from the series featuring Odom, Kardashian, and his two children from his previous relationship. The series, titled \"Khloé & Lamar\", debuted on April 10, 2011. Soon thereafter, Odom almost opted out of the show as the filming wore him down. The series was canceled in 2012 after two seasons.\n\nOn August 30, 2013, Odom was arrested on charges of driving under the influence (DUI). After the arrest, he refused to submit to a chemical test. Almost a week earlier, gossip websites had alleged that Odom had been abusing drugs, which prompted worried tweets from former teammates and coaches. On December 9, Odom pleaded no contest to the DUI charges and accepted a sentence of three years' probation and three months of alcohol abuse treatment. On December 13, after months of speculated separation, Kardashian filed for divorce from Odom and for legal restoration of her last name. Divorce papers were signed by both parties in July 2015; however, the divorce did not receive final approval from a judge before being dismissed by request in October 2015.\n\nOn October 13, 2015, Odom was hospitalized after being discovered unconscious at the Love Ranch, a legal brothel in Crystal, Nevada. Odom, who had used cocaine in the days prior to his medical emergency, suffered kidney failure and several strokes; he became comatose and was placed on life support in a hospital in Las Vegas before regaining consciousness. He was transferred from Las Vegas to a Los Angeles hospital by medical transport. In the aftermath of the incident, Kardashian withdrew her request for a divorce; she stated that she had not reconciled with Odom, but wished to assist him in making medical decisions during his recovery.\n\nOdom's recovery went well. On January 8, 2016, Odom's paternal aunt JaNean Mercer told \"Us Weekly\" that \"the former NBA star is on the road to recovery after finally leaving the hospital earlier in the week.\" She said \"Lamar continues to make remarkable strides.\" In early 2016, Khloé Kardashian said \"I'm just there to support and care for him. But he is doing amazing.\" However, on May 26, 2016, Kardashian filed for divorce again. Their divorce was finalized in December 2016. In 2017, Odom spoke publicly about his health struggles, his cocaine addiction, and his recovery from that addiction; he called himself a \"'walking miracle'\" who had \"'cheated death'\", and acknowledged that his past drug use had made \"'the end of [his basketball] career come along a little faster'\".\n\nOdom has his own music and film production company, Rich Soil Entertainment. He appeared in a Taco Bell commercial with Charles Barkley during Super Bowl XLIV. Additionally, Odom made a cameo on the second season of the HBO television series \"Entourage\".\n\nOdom is noted for his fondness for candy. Wrigley made a replica of the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy out of candy in celebration of the Lakers' victory in the 2009 Finals, and Odom's name is featured on the base.\n\nIn 2015, Odom was #1 on the Google Trends list for living people, which measures the highest spikes in traffic over a sustained period compared to the previous year.\n\n"}

He was a long-term member of parliament representing Phrae, leader of the United Thai Party and the Justice Unity Party. He was publicly known as the \"godfather\" \"(jao pho)\" of Phrae or even \"godfather of the North\".\n\nNarong Wongwan was born in Phrae, where his grandfather had acquired a fortune from wood production. Narong studied economics in the United States. After working for the family's saw mill for some time, he went into tobacco growing and curing in the 1950s. During the 1970s the tobacco business in Northern Thailand boomed and Narong became a multi-millionaire. Many peasants of Phrae and the neighbouring provinces were employed on Narong's and his family's plantations and in their curing plants. Therefore, he accumulated considerable economic and social influence in the region. This was used by him as a base for his political career. \n\nNarong was a member of Phrae's provincial council as early as 1949. He founded the United Thai Party and was elected member of parliament in 1979. He was steadily re-elected in all elections until 1992. He joined the government of prime minister Prem Tinsulanonda, becoming deputy interior minister in 1980, deputy minister of agriculture in 1981, rising to be minister in 1983. After the election of 1986, his party was in the opposition. In 1989, he merged his party with three minor parties and renamed it Solidarity Party. After a cabinet reshuffle, the party became part of Chatichai Choonhavan's government coalition and Narong was again made minister of agriculture. \n\nAfter the coup d'état of 1991 and ahead of the election in March 1992, he joined with other provincial businessmen, bureaucrats and supporters of the military coup group to form the Justice Unity Party, of which he became the chairman. The party won the election and Narong was designated prime minister, when media alleged that the United States had refused him entry admission due to the suspection of involvement in drug trafficking. The US government threatened that relations between the two countries could worsen in case that Narong became head of government. He had to relinquish premiership and the parliament instead nominated the putschist General Suchinda Kraprayoon. Really, Narong had not been prosecuted as there was no sufficient evidence. As the leader of the biggest coalition party, Narong still became deputy prime minister under Suchinda. After the bloody crackdown on the oppositional movement protesting against the military-backed government, the Justice Unity Party was discredited and dissolved. Narong instead joined the Thai Nation Party. After the party's electoral success in 1995, Narong was poised to become minister of interior, but again he was hindered by allegations of criminal activity. In 2000, Thailand's Supreme Court condemned the tabloid newspaper \"Khao Sot\" for spreading false allegations against Narong.\n"}

Based on an 18th-century New England model, it was part of the original 1796 town plat overseen by Moses Cleaveland, and remains today as an integral part of the city's center. The square is centered on the former intersection of Superior Avenue and Ontario Street. Cleveland's three tallest buildings, Key Tower, 200 Public Square and the Terminal Tower, face the square.\n\nOther Public Square landmarks include the 1855 Old Stone Church and the former Higbee's department store made famous in the 1983 film \"A Christmas Story\", which reopened as the Horseshoe Casino Cleveland on May 14, 2012. The square was redeveloped in 2016 by the city into a more pedestrian-friendly environment with green space on the northern half of the square, a hard surface on the southern half of the square, and transit lanes on a newly constructed Superior Avenue (which is open only to bus traffic).\n\nA monument to Civil War soldiers and sailors occupies the southeast section of the square. City founder Moses Cleaveland and reformist mayor Tom L. Johnson each have statues on the square.\n\nPublic Square was part of the Connecticut Land Company's original plan for the city, which were overseen by Moses Cleaveland in the 1790s. The square is signature of the layout for early New England towns, which Cleveland was modeled after. While it initially served as a common pasture for settlers' animals, less than a century later Public Square was the height of modernity, when in 1879 it became the first street in the world to be lit with electric street lights, arc lamps designed by Cleveland native Charles F. Brush. The square was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 18, 1975.\n\nA parking lot now faces the northwest quadrant of the square. A 12-story building, which was built on the spot in 1913, was demolished in 1990 to make way for the new Ameritrust Center, an skyscraper designed by New York's Kohn Pedersen Fox. Before construction began, Ameritrust was acquired by Society Bank, which was also planning to construct and subsequently relocate to a new building on Public Square—Key Tower (formerly known as Society Center). Because Society did not need two skyscrapers, plans for the Ameritrust building across the square were scrapped.\n\nOther buildings that face the square include 55 Public Square (1958), 75 Public Square (1915), the Society for Savings Building (1890), Metzenbaum Courthouse (1910), the former May Company department store (1914), the Park Building (1903), and the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel (1918). The demolished Cuyahoga Building (1893) and Williamson Building (1900) formerly stood on the site of 200 Public Square.\n\nPublic Square is often the site of political rallies and civic functions, including a free annual Independence Day concert by the Cleveland Orchestra. At the Balloonfest '86, close to 1.5 million balloons rose up from Public Square, engulfing the Terminal Tower and setting a world record.\n\nIn collaboration with landscape architect James Corner, the city in 2009 began to explore concepts for a redesign of the square. In October 2011, Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson proposed his plan to redevelop the square, which included closing Superior Avenue and Ontario Street to create a large green space in the center. On October 23, 2014, the Cleveland Landmarks Commission approved a plan which closed Ontario Street but kept Superior Avenue open to bus traffic, and kept the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument prominent.\n\nThe project began construction on March 9, 2015, and was officially opened on June 30, 2016. Public Square's development was showcased during the Cleveland Cavaliers championship parade as a welcome sight with much of the construction materials removed to display the renovation. At first, buses did not run along Superior Avenue as planned, but in order to avoid a $12 million repayment of grants to the Federal Transit Administration, the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority agreed to run buses along it by March 2017. An episode of NBC's American Ninja Warrior was held in Public Square and aired in July 2017 A privately operated cafe, Rebol, located in the southwestern area of Public Square, opened in July 2016.\n\nPublic Square is bounded by East Roadway and West Roadway at the western and eastern ends and by Rockwell Avenue and South Roadway at the northern and southern ends.\n\nIn total, ten U.S. and state routes meet at Public Square. It is the northern terminus of SR 3, SR 8, and SR 43; the western terminus of US 322, US 422, SR 14, and SR 87; and the northeastern terminus of US 42. US 6 passes through the square on Superior, and US 20 enters from the west on Superior and leaves via Euclid Avenue. US 21 also terminated at Public Square until that route was truncated to Marietta in 1967.\n\nPublic Square is adjacent to the Tower City transit station, served by three RTA rail lines. The HealthLine, a bus rapid transit line that travels along Euclid Avenue, terminates at Public Square.\n\n"}

Colón (1904–1983), was the general manager of the Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico. He reorganized the company during its time of crisis and is credited with having saved the coffee industry in Puerto Rico.\n\nColón (birth name: Ramiro L. Colón Colón), was born in and raised in the countryside of Ponce, Puerto Rico. There he received his primary and secondary education. Being raised in the country, he developed an intense love for the island's agriculture. He went to work for the \"Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico\" (Cooperative of Coffee Growers of Puerto Rico) in 1925, the same year it was founded, at the age of 21.\n\nThe cooperative was the first one of its kind in Puerto Rico. It was founded to protect the coffee industry, which was one of the island's most important export products, from outside imitators. The situation was the following: many merchants were importing coffee from other countries, of poor quality and freshness, and passing them off as locally produced. When tourists and local consumers tasted the coffee, they complained about how bad it was, and as a result sales declined drastically and the coffee industry suffered greatly. In 1928, hurricane San Felipe destroyed most of the coffee plantations on the island, and the Great Depression also affected the economy.\n\nIn 1932, Colón was named general manager of the cooperative and undertook the reorganization of the company during its time of crisis. The cooperative was almost bankrupt, and the first thing Colón did was to obtain a loan from the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. With the money, he bought new equipment to replace the old and outdated equipment in the company. Colón was able to convince the Puerto Rican legislature to pass a law against the then-rampant adulteration and contraband of coffee.\n\nColón was credited with convincing the government to impose import tariffs on coffee, thereby ensuring the island would not be invaded by cheap coffee of poor quality, which often was advertised as locally produced. The cooperative purchased and installed a new torrefaction plant in which the local coffee was processed. Colon set out to gain access to the United States coffee market, helped the local coffee growers obtain lines of credit from local bankers, and got financial help from the federal and local government for the export of the cooperative's coffee. This coffee was named \"Cafe Rico\" and was well received locally and internationally, soon reestablishing the good fame of Puerto Rico's coffee worldwide. The cooperative became the first coffee manufacturer to sell its coffee in sealed cans. The quality of Cafe Rico has received numerous medals and recognitions in contests celebrated all over the world. Colón established the only coffee tasting laboratory in Puerto Rico. One of Cafe Rico's byproducts, \"San Carlos Selection\", is the official coffee of Vatican City.\n\nUnder Colon's leadership, the cooperative was able to expand and diversify. The company sells food and agricultural equipment with sales of over $5 million. It also owns and operates an egg processing company which calls its product \"Huevos Rico\" (Rico Eggs). The cooperative owns an insurance company, its own credit corporation that grants loans to farmers, and its own printing plant that prints and distributes an agricultural magazine worldwide. Recently, the cooperative has started to operate gasoline stations in San Juan, Mayaguez and Ponce.\n\nWhen Colón took over the company in 1932 as a general manager the cooperative had only $284,000 in annual sales. By 1963 the cooperative had over $35,000,000 in sales. The cooperative has offices and warehouses in Ponce (main offices), San Juan, Mayagüez, Arecibo, Yauco, San Sebastian, Utuado, Adjuntas, Jayuya and Ciales.\n\nColón served as a senator, representing the district of Ponce in the Puerto Rican Senate and was named Administrator of the cooperative, a position he held until his retirement in 1965. In 1952 the Constitution of Puerto Rico was adopted, creating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Colón was a member of the Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico. He was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Puerto Rico in the years 1948, 1952 and 1956. Ramiro L. Colón was candidate for governor in 1968 for the Republican Statehood Party.\n\nRamiro L. Colón died in the city of Ponce, which honored his memory by naming an elementary school after him. He is remembered as the man who saved the Puerto Rican coffee industry.\n\n\n"}

Active in politics from an early age, Bonner became a supporter and confidant of W.A.C. Bennett, who would go on to lead the Social Credit Party to victory in the 1952 provincial election. To the surprise of many, Bennett appointed the unelected, 32 year-old Bonner as the province's Attorney General — the youngest in B.C.'s history. Bonner would be elected to represent the riding of Vancouver-Point Grey in the provincial election of 1953, which was also the first Social Credit majority government in the province. He would retain the position of Attorney General for the next sixteen years, quickly becoming one of the most powerful ministers and closest advisors to Bennett in the Socreds' long spell of governance.\n\nBonner's tenure as Attorney General was marked by legal clashes with First Nations tribes over land and resource rights, especially in light of the rapid hydroelectric, mining, and forestry development of the province's hinterland. Perhaps more significantly, from a historical perspective, was the provincial government's conflicts with the Sons Of Freedom, an anti-government sect of Doukhobors resident in the Kootenay region of the province. Clashes over public education led to the apprehension en masse of Freedomite children, and their confinement in government schools.\n\nDuring his time in cabinet, Bonner also served at various times concurrently as Minister of Education and Minister of Trade and Commerce. In the legislature, Bonner proved capable, serving as Bennett's House Leader. Contemporaries described him as \"articulate, urbane, and always well prepared, with a demonstrated air of superiority and a ready laugh.\"\n\nBonner left provincial politics in 1968 to become vice-president of MacMillan Bloedel, a Vancouver-based logging and lumber company. He would later go on to become the firm's president and chief executive officer. Bonner left Mac Blo in 1976 to become chairman of BC Hydro, the provincial crown corporation responsible for producing and supplying hydroelectric power. He retired from that position in 1985.\n\nBonner died in Vancouver in 2005.\n\n"}

For example, where a company owns a factory, but the property would have a higher value as a residential lot, the asset should be fair valued as a residential lot.\n\nThe concept of the Fair Value Hierarchy there for is introduced in paragraphs 22 through 31 in SFAS No. 157. To provide the financial statement user with more insight into the valuation techniques and to create comparability among financial statements, SFAS No. 157 requires the fair value assets and liabilities to be allocated to based on the transparencies of the inputs to valuing the assets/liabilities. \n\nLevel 1, the highest on the hierarchy, indicates assets/liabilities with the most transparent and tangible valuation techniques. A Level 1 financial instrument typically has quoted prices and active markets – for example, an equity stock. This type of instrument has the most verifiable and reliable fair value measurement.\n\nLevel 2 instruments require more involvement in valuing than Level 1 instruments. Level 2 “inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.” For example, an interest rate swap uses known, public data, such as interest rates and the contract terms can be used to calculate a value of the interest rate swap. The instrument can be valued indirectly using observable data. Another example would be using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. \n\nLevel 3 is the most unobservable of the levels and indicates use of valuation techniques and data that may not be verifiable. These types of instruments involve a great deal of assumptions and estimates. Examples may include infrequently traded asset backed securities or investments in privately owned companies\n\nSFAS No. 157, paragraph 32 requires two main types of disclosures – a Fair Value Balance Sheet and a Level 3 Rollforward.\n\nThe Fair Value Balance Sheet is similar to a typical balance sheet by disclosing the value of the assets and liabilities as of a specific date. However, the Fair Value Balance Sheet only includes financial instruments and uses fair value (concept defined above) as of a specific date. Additionally, the Fair Value Balance Sheet is segregated into the three fair value hierarchies described above – Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.\n\nThe Level 3 Rollforward reconciles the Level 3 balances for assets and liabilities from the prior reporting period to the current reporting period. This reconciliation must include the total gains and losses (realized and unrealized) for the period, the purchase, sales, issuances, and settlements (net), the transfers in and/or out of Level 3. These components should reconcile the prior period’s balance to the current period’s balance.\n\nThese are the two main tables disclosed, but additional information is required such as description of the valuation techniques, significant transfers between levels, etc. Additionally, various regulatory bodies, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and other groups within the FASB, will issue further guidelines on SFAS No. 157 disclosures.\n\n"}

He worked for the merchants and bankers Carlo and Bernardo Soderini until establishing himself independently in partnership with his younger brother Carlo.\nIn 1567 he married the teenaged Urszula, daughter of doctor of medicine Wojciech Baza (died 1569), physician to the court. The year after the wedding the couple moved into a \"kamienica\" residence in the centre of Kraków, rebuilt in the Renaissance style. This building, known as the Italian House or Montelupi House, also served as the central post office. Urszula was to die without surviving issue on 12 July 1586, aged 35, after 19 years of marriage. At one point Francesco Pucci had consulted John Dee on Montelupi's behalf, to determine whether their childlessness could be due to witchcraft.\n\nAs a merchant, Montelupi traded with Italy, Germany, England, Austria and Russia. As a banker, his clients included the papal nuncios at the Polish court. In 1574, the city reimbursed Montelupi a little over \"fl\".1,827 for his contributions to the ceremony of receiving and performing hommage to the new king, Henry III; these contributions included a yard and a half of red Chinese cloth for the dish holding the keys to the city, and a number of vermeil vessels and a large silver vase that were presented to the king. In 1581 Montelupi advanced \"fl\".3,000 to King Stephen Báthory to help finance that year's campaign against Muscovy. Towards the end of his life he became court banker to King Sigismund III, and consul of the Italian community in the capital. In the 1580s he funded the publication of work by the Franciscan writer Annibale Rosselli. He died in Kraków on 18 August 1600, aged 84, leaving an estate valued at \"fl\".150,000. He was succeeded by his nephew and adopted heir, Valerio Tamburini Montelupi (Walerian Montelupi, 1548–1613), who thus became the richest citizen in Kraków.\n\nFrom 1568 Montelupi was postmaster general of the Polish Royal Post (succeeding Pietro Maffon), running one public service to Vilnius (in three weeks) and another to Vienna and Venice (in ten days). These services were suspended in 1572 and when resumed in 1574 were reserved for the carriage of royal messages. In 1583 he was confirmed as royal postmaster general by the new king, Stephen Báthory, on condition he maintain public deliveries between the major cities of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and an international service to and from Venice at least twice each month. His position enabled Montelupi to provide high-level information services for correspondents including the Medici in Florence and the Fugger in Augsburg.\n\nAt Sebastiano's death the postmastership also passed to his nephew Valerio, and in time to Valerio's descendants, the last postmaster of the dynasty being Carlo Montelupi de Mari (Karol Montelupi, died 1662). Another Italian, Angelo Maria Bandinelli, then became royal postmaster general.\n\nA magnificent monument to Sebastiano Montelupi and his wife Urszula was erected in St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków. The work has been attributed to the workshop of Italian-Polish architect and sculptor Santi Gucci.\n\nA street in Kraków is named after his family, as is his kamienica, and a palace built by his descendants.\n\nIn 2008 a commemorative stamp set celebrating the 450th anniversary of the Polish postal service was issued, featuring portraits of Prosper Provano and Sebastiano Montelupi. The portrait of Montelupi was based on the effigy incorporated into the Montelupi monument.\n\n\n\n"}

Parking lots, footpaths, driveways, streets and highways are all candidate locations where this material could be used.\n\nIn 2013 Students at the Solar Institute at George Washington University installed a solar panel walking path designed by Onyx Solar, something they call \"solar pavement\".\n\n\"SolaRoad\" is a system being developed by the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), the Ooms Groep, Imtech and the Netherlands province of North Holland. They plan to install their panels on 100 m of cycle path in Krommenie, Netherlands in November 2014. A variant concept of a \"solar road\" installed in Avenhorn, by Ooms Avenhorn Holding AV, uses asphalt and tarmac to absorb the sun’s rays and heat water for use in domestic heating.\n\nThe Solar Roadways company of Idaho, USA, is developing a prototype system to replace current roads, parking lots, and driveways with photovoltaic solar road panels that generate electricity.\n\nSouth Korea has built a freeway with the median covered by solar panels above a bikepath.\n\nThe first photovoltaic road in the world was constructed in Tourouvre, Orne, France in 2016. Called \"Wattway\", it was built by Société Nouvelle Aeracem (SNA), and dedicated by the French Minister of Ecology, Ségolène Royal on October 25, 2016. The 1-km section of road opened to traffic on 22 December 2016. It is believed the road will provide enough power for the town's streetlights.\n\nThe Jinan solar highway opened in China in December 2017 along a 1.2 mile stretch. It uses transparent concrete on the top layer with the solar panels underneath. It was the second solar roadway in the city, the first opened in September 2017 using a different technology.\n\nThe main purpose of solar roadways is to replace asphalt roads with Solar Panels which generate energy through the sun that can be used by local houses or businesses that are connected to the system from either the house’s driveway or the businesses parking lot. The panels will also increase the number of charging stations for electric cars if that station is connected to the solar roadway. Each panel is roughly 12’ by 12’ of interlocking panels that have their own LED lights that will be used as the road lines, and can also be used to spell out words like “Reduce Speed” or “Traffic Ahead” to help the flow of traffic.\n\nThere are 3 layers that make up the solar panels:\n\n1. The Road Surface Layer - The Road Layer is the High Strength layer that has the photovoltaic cells which attracts the sun’s rays, it has traction so vehicles don’t slide off the road, and it’s waterproof to protect the layers below.\n\n2. The Electronic Layer - The Electronic Layers contain a mini microprocessor board that helps control the heating element of the panels, this technology can help melt the snow that lands on the panels so that hazardous road conditions will no longer be an issue in the more northern regions. This layer can sense how much weight is on the panels and can control the heating element to melt the snow.\n\n3. The Base Plate Layer - The Base Plate Layer is the layer that collects the energy from the sun and distributes the power to the homes or businesses that are connected to the solar roadways. This will also be used to transfer the energy to cars as they drive over the strip to recharge the battery.\n\n\"Slate\" magazine stated that solar roadways would produce less electricity than solar cells that are placed at an angle, and that less light would touch them because of shade, dirt covering the road, and cars blocking the sun from touching the panels. \n\nCritics have pointed out that solar roadways would be both more expensive, and less productive than more conventional ways of combining solar power with infrastructure, such as building shelters over roads and parking areas and putting traditional solar panels on the roofs; Elon Musk demonstrated that there is ample space in the US, apart from roads, to fulfill the power requirements of the country.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) began testing out “smart pavement” at a rest stop outside of Conway, Missouri along historic Route 66 late in 2016. The pilot program currently covers about 200 square feet of sidewalk at the visitor center and cost $100,000 (Landers), largely subsidized by the Federal Highway Administration. It’s all part of Missouri’s Road to Tomorrow initiative to find new innovations in their transportation infrastructure. Missouri wants to take advantage of these roadways to implement other, related technologies. The panels will heat the road and keep snow and ice from accumulating. They will also feature LED diodes that will increase the visibility of road lines. The LEDs would also double in helping prevent paint from inhibiting solar power generation. The panels have not had enough time to determine durability, energy efficiency, or cost effectiveness in a real world sense yet, so MoDOT has not reach any conclusions about feasibility and future application yet.\n\nThe Online Electric Vehicle being developed by KAIST (the  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) has electrical circuits built into the road which will power suitably adapted vehicles via contactless electromagnetic induction. A pilot system powering electric buses is under development. Germany's IAV is another company that is developing induction chargers.\n\nRoadway-powered electric vehicle system is the patent held by Howard R. Ross. It has several components. The first of which is an all electric vehicle that would be fit with electromechanical batteries that accept a charge from the road. The road is the second component and would have strategically placed charging coils as to only charge the car when needed. These cars and roads would not require gas or solar power.\n\nNowhere in the world is an invention like this currently implemented, and this is due to the cost of the infrastructure overhaul that would be needed to bring this patent into reality.\n\nThe \"Smart Highway\" concept developed by Studio Roosegaarde and the infrastructure management group Heijmans in the Netherlands incorporated photo-luminescent paint for road markings, which absorb light during the day then glow for up to 10 hours. The technology was demonstrated on a stretch of highway in Brabant, Netherlands.\n\nSnowmelt systems using electricity or hot water to heat roads and pavements have been installed in various locations.\n\nSolar Roadways has proposed including a snowmelt system with their photovoltaic road panels since the panels already have electrical power connections for harvesting photovoltaic power. Skeptics point to the energy requirements.\n\nICAX Limited of London's \"Interseasonal Heat Capture\" technology captures solar energy in thermal banks and releases it back under a roadway, heating it and keeping asphalt free of ice.\n\n\n"}

Statutory reserves are a type of actuarial reserve.\n\nStatutory reserves are intended to ensure that insurance companies are able to meet future obligations created by insurance policies. These reserves must be reported in statements filed with insurance regulatory bodies. They are calculated with a certain level of conservatism in order to protect policyholders and beneficiaries.\n\nThere are two types of methods for calculation of statutory reserves. Reserve methodology may be fully prescribed by law, which is often called formula-based reserving. This is in contrast to principles-based reserves, where actuaries are given latitude to use professional judgment in determining methodology and assumptions for reserve calculation. In the United States, where formula-based reserves are used, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners plans to implement principles-based reserves in 2017.\n\nIn the U.S. life insurance industry, statutory reserves are most commonly computed using the Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method, or CRVM, the method prescribed by law for computing minimum required reserves.\n\nThe size of a CRVM reserve, as with most life reserves, is affected by the age and sex of the insured person, how long the policy for which it is computed has been in force, the plan of insurance offered by the policy, the rate of interest used in the calculation, and the mortality table with which the actuarial present values are computed.\n\nThe Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method was itself established by the Standard Valuation Law (SVL), which was created by the NAIC and adopted by the several states shortly after World War II. The first mortality table prescribed by the SVL was the 1941 CSO (Commissioner's Standard Ordinary) table, at a maximum interest rate of 3½%. Subsequent amendments to the Standard Valuation Law have permitted the use of more modern mortality tables and higher rates of interest. The effect of these changes has in general been to reduce the amount of the reserves which life insurance companies are legally required to hold.\n\n\n\n"}

It started in 2012 as the very first tech festival organised through crowdfunding. The festival has developed into a well-known tech conference in and out of Europe. The main concept behind Tech Open Air is to bring together the areas of technology, music, art, and science by providing a platform for multi-disciplinary knowledge exchange, collaboration, and development. Tech Open Air is organised every year in June or July and gathers a number of influential speakers, entrepreneurs, artists, scientists, start-ups, and attendees from Germany and 55+ other countries.\n\nThe TOA17 Festival took place between the 11–14 July 2017, remaining for a second year at former GDR Radio Station, Funkhaus Berlin. 2017 saw the Satellites program extend even further with kick-off events (including the official Satellites launch party with Seth Troxler) taking place on the Tuesday before the Conference. \n\nTOA Conference also expanded further with a brand new 4500qm exhibition hall \"The House of Tech\". This unique TOA style take on a traditional expo hosted brands such as Facebook, Google, Samsung NEXT, as well as a host of Europe's leading startups. Over 6,000 people attended the conference, where the 200+ speakers included Adam D'Angelo (Co-Founder & CEO, Quora), Richard Sharp (CTO, Shazam), Richie Hawtin, Mate Galic (CTO, Native Instruments), Erika Lust (Co-founder, Erika Lust Films), Hector Ouilhet (Head of Design, Google Search), Imogen Heap (Founder, Mycelia).\n\n2017 was also the inaugural year for TOA Music Fest which took place on the last night of the festival with over 2000 people in attendance. The night featured live performances from Machinedrum and Schwarz Don't Crack, as well as DJ sets from the likes of Blaenk Minds and Samuel Morgan.\n\nTech Open Air held its fifth edition on 13–15 July 2016, with the conference taking place at a new venue, Funkhaus Nalepastraße, over the first two days. In 2016 the TOA satellite programme expanded to occur over the whole of 15 July as well as on the evenings of the conference. In total 177 satellite events took place in Berlin across three days.\n\nThe TOA conference hosted 166 speakers and included keynote talks from founders and entrepreneurs such as Yancey Strickler, Luis von Ahn and Cindy Gallop. In addition to the talks, attendees were able to take part in a number of different formats such as Pitch-nic, Music Meets Tech, and a Reverse Pitch where investors were able to pitch their investments to promising startups.\n\nIn total, 11,221 people attended TOA from over 40 countries. Speakers included Mathias Döpfner (Axel Springer), Catherina Fake (Flickr), Luke Woods (Facebook), Dominik Richter (HelloFresh), Katie Dill (Airbnb), Daniel Barenboim (Berlin State Opera), Gabriel Flateman (Casper) and Susan Danziger (Ziggeo).\n\nTech Open Air 2015 (#TOA15) took place July 15–17, 2015. The \"Unconference\" as well as more than 150 satellite events across Berlin were the main components of the festival. The programme invited the event attendees to experience engaging talks presented by over 110 professionals, as well as interactive panels, art installations, live music, and networking opportunities. Satellite events provided an opportunity for Tech Open Air attendees to fully immerse themselves in the Berlin startup culture.\n\nOne additional format of the \"Unconference\" was a networking session called Back to the Future: Enterprise Meets Startup which inspired and encouraged cross-industry collaboration; the Pitch-Nic (a high-speed pitching session for start-ups and investors); and the Hardware Pitch where six hardware innovations pitched their ideas on stage.\n\nThe 2015 edition was attended by over 5000 people from various industries and nations (over 30 countries represented). Around 150 media outlets were involved in this year's event including the Wall Street Journal, BBC and TechCrunch.

Critical reception for the game from Western gaming websites has been decidedly poor.\n\n\"Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise\" is a business simulation game in which the player chooses among several characters in the original \"Mega Man\" series and competes with other players or the computer AI in purchasing spaces of property. The characters include Roll, Dr. Light, Dr. Wily, Dr. Cossack, and Kalinka. Each participant is given a turn, moving a certain number of spaces on the board. If they land on a property square, they are given the option to buy it with a certain about of Zenny (the game's currency). They can then charge other characters rent when they land on that building. However, other characters can also buy part of the same square, allowing each owner to charge a smaller amount of rent. Some squares contain cards that cause various effects on the board such as raising property prices or the development level of a building. The game's winning conditions can vary depending on the set rules. The winner may be the character with the most owned spaces, the most remaining Zenny, or the most developments.\n\n\"Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise\" was developed by Capcom during a time when the \"Mega Man\" franchise was at its height of its popularity. Series artist Keiji Inafune had very little involvement in the development of \"Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise\", simply designing the cover art and the new character Reggae. When developing the game, the team wanted to include as many bosses from previous titles in the series as possible. However, they ultimately decided to leave room for an original character that fans could associate with the new game. When discussing a bird character labeled , one of the team members misread it as , resulting in Reggae's resemblance to the species.\n\nThe January 1993 issue of the Mexican magazine \"Club Nintendo\" featured \"Wily & Right no RockBoard\" as part of a preview article for the 1993 Consumer Electronics Show. Titling the game as \"Mega Board\", the article even had a screenshot featuring English text. An unreleased Game Boy version was apparently in the works by the Japanese company Dual, which listed the game on the credits page of its official website. Hitoshi Sakimoto was responsible for the audio in this version.\n\nCritical reception for \"Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise\" outside Japan has been poor. GameSpot contributors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer found the relatively obscure game to be of no particular interest to anyone other than \"Mega Man\" fans. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com summated, \"An oddity of the Famicom era, this import title was a simple \"\"Game of Life\"\"-style board game with a \"Mega Man\" motif -- novel, but hardly essential.\" GamesRadar editor Brett Elston called it a \"probably better-off-lost excursion into Mega-mediocrity.\" However, not all views of the game have been negative. JC Fletcher of Joystiq expressed desire for the game's release on the Wii's Virtual Console service. He opined that it is \"actually nowhere near as terrible as a \"Mega Man\" board game \"should\" be\" and that its various effects and winning conditions grant it a much faster pace than \"Monopoly\".\n\n\n"}

The resulting mathematical models may be used to perform sensitivity analysis and generate data output in the form of reports and schedules.\n\nDue to the complexity level of building a workforce model, adoption of a workforce model is usually found in industries that have complex work rules, skilled or certified workers, medium to large teams of workers and fluctuating demand. Some examples include healthcare, public safety, and retail.\n\nA workforce modeling solution can also refer to software that effectively captures all the complexity of process from start to finish and delivers complete and correct results. Components include:\n\nFor a more detailed definition, the term must be differentiated from traditional staff scheduling. Staff scheduling is rooted in time management and encompasses the mere administration of past and future working times. However, during the last ten to fifteen years, this traditional approach has evolved towards a demand-oriented solution which, under economic aspects, also includes changes in personnel requirements and objectives when optimizing the scheduling of staff. Besides the two core aspects of demand-orientation and optimization, workforce modeling also incorporates the forecast of the workload and the required staff, the integration of employees into the scheduling process through interactivity, the management of working times and accounts as well as analyzing and monitoring the entire process.\n\nWorkforce modeling solutions can, and should, be deployed enterprise-wide wherever complex scheduling needs or legal staffing ratios must be met. Due to the complex nature of a workforce model, creating one by hand is nearly impossible. By using a software solution for demand-oriented workforce management, planners can optimize staffing by creating schedules that at all times conform as closely as possible to the actual requirement. At the same time, a workforce modeling solution helps users to observe all relevant legislation, local agreements and the contracts with individual employees – including work-life balance guidelines.\n\nMany workforce modeling solution applications use the more common linear programming approach to create the Workforce Model. Linear methods of achieving a schedule are generally based on assumptions that demand is based on a series of independent events, all of which have a consistent, predictable outcome. Although this method is very common, the results are in most cases not as complete or efficient. In general, they produce a resulting schedule that is up to 75% complete and leaves the scheduler to complete the remaining shift assignments.\n\nHeuristics have been applied to the problem and metaheuristics has been identified as the best method for generating complex scheduling solutions. Using this technique, many more solutions are available to the modeling process resulting in schedules that are not only closer to 100% complete, but are also optimized to many different criteria at the same time.\n\n"}
