He completed two years of college at Cornell University and one year at Harvard University. Instead of starting his senior year at Harvard, Boni convinced his father to finance the establishment (originally at 95 Fifth Avenue and then at 135 MacDougal Street) of the Washington Square Bookshop with Albert's brother Charles as a partner. The Boni brothers' book store became a meeting place for leftist, Greenwich Village writers and intellectuals. The Boni brothers, with two other partners, created the Little Leather Library of pocket-sized editions of literary classics bound in imitation leather. These editions were hugely successful — the Woolworth stores sold a million copies in one year. In 1913–1914 the Boni brothers published the short-lived literary magazine \"The Glebe\". In 1914, Albert Boni, with Lawrence Langner and others, founded the Washington Square Players. In 1915 the Boni brothers sold the Washington Square Bookshop to Frank Shay.\n\nIn 1917 Albert Boni married Cornelia 'Nell' van Leeuwen, a widow with a young son, adopted by Albert Boni upon the marriage. With financial backing from Horace Liveright's father-in-law, paper executive Herman Elsas, the two partners Albert Boni and Horace Liveright incorporated the publishing house Boni & Liveright on February 16, 1917. Boni & Liveright founded the Modern Library (originally called \"Modern Library of the World's Best Classics\"), which was eventually acquired by Random House. The Modern Library was financed by $25,000 from Felix M. Warburg and the Boni brothers' uncle Thomas Seltzer. A year and a half after incorporating, Albert Boni sold his interest in Boni & Liveright to Horace Liveright in 1919. However, the name of the firm remained \"Boni & Liveright\" until 1928, when the name of the publishing house was changed to \"Horace Liveright, Inc.\"\n\nIn 1923 the Boni brothers purchased the publishing company Lieber & Lewis and renamed it the \"Albert and Charles Boni Publishing Company.\" In 1926, they purchased the publishing business of their uncle, Thomas Seltzer. In 1929 the Boni brothers created Boni Paper Books, which offered one soft-cover book per month for 12 months for a yearly subscription price of $5. Boni Paper Books failed during the Great Depression. In 1939 Albert Boni founded the Readex Microprint Corporation, a microfilm publisher of reference materials. When Albert Boni retired in 1974 his only son, William, took over as president of Readex. Albert Boni died in Florida in 1981 and was survived by his wife, his son, and his son's three daughters.\n\nWhile microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was conceived by Albert Boni in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff who was showing his experimentation's related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Albert that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs this technology may enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space. Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography. This process proved to produce a 6\" by 9\" index card which stored 100 pages of text from the normal sized publications he was reproducing. Boni began the Readex Microprint company to produce and license this technology. He also published an article \"A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects (1943)\" which appeared in a supplemental 18th issue of the Photo-Lab Index.\n"}

The award was also known as the Army-Navy Production Award. The award was created to encourage industrial mobilization and production of war time materials. By war's end, the award had been earned by only 5% of the more than 85,000 companies involved in producing materials for the U.S. military's war effort.\n\nAn earlier award, the Navy \"E\" Award, had been created in 1906 during Theodore Roosevelt's administration. By the end of World War I, the Navy \"E\" Award had been joined by the Army \"A\" Award and the Army-Navy Munitions Board \"Star\".\n\nThese three separate awards continued until seven months after the attack on Pearl Harbor had pulled the United States into World War II. In July 1942, the War Department proclaimed that the new Army-Navy \"E\" Award would merge the Navy \"E\", Army \"A\" and Army-Navy Munitions Board \"Star\" into a single, service-wide award.\n\nAll factories engaged in war production were eligible to receive the award. Government as well as privately owned plants were eligible, as were contractors.\n\nAlthough the award was granted to industry, one academic institution and one individual received it. Iowa State College (now Iowa State University) received the award for its contribution to the production of uranium for the Manhattan Project. Dr. Harley A. Wilhelm received the award for inventing the Ames process for the extraction, purification and mass production of uranium for the Manhattan Project, which occurred at Iowa State College. \n\nSome factors which were considered in selecting recipients were:\n\n\nDistrict procurement officers, chiefs of the supply services, agencies concerned with production and the Commanding Officers for the Matériel Commands would recommend plants, complete with the reasons for such recommendations. An Award Board would review the recommended plants and decide on granting of the awards.\n\nThe award consisted of a pennant for the production plant and emblems for all employees in the plant at the time the award was made. The pennant was a triangular swallowtail with a white border, with a capital E within a yellow wreath of oak and laurel leaves on a vertical divided blue and red background. ARMY is on the red background and NAVY on the blue background. \nPlants that maintained an outstanding record of performance for six months after receiving their original Army-Navy E-Award were granted a star award, with a white star added to their pennant. As with only a small percentage of all war production companies earning an Army-Navy \"E\" Award, only a small number of these earned stars, with a very small number of plants earning six stars by the end of the war. \n\nUsually an Army officer and a Navy officer would be present at a ceremony, where the company would assemble all the employees involved in production. After the award of the pennant to the plant (to be flown), the employees present would receive individual pins.\n\nA total of 4,283 companies received the award in the course of the war. This amounted to about five percent of the companies engaged in war work.\n\nThe Army-Navy \"E\" Award was terminated three months after the end of World War II, on December 5, 1945.\n\n"}

Further, the suit alleged that the ΑΚΑ board approved a \"pension stipend\" of $4,000 a month for four years after McKinzie leaves office without the necessary approval of members, and that a $1 million life insurance policy was purchased for her. McKinzie was also accused of spending $900,000 on a life-sized wax statue of herself. McKinzie responded that $45,000 was actually spent on statues of herself and the sorority's first International President, the late Nellie Quander. McKinzie said the expenses were \"consistent with furthering ΑΚΑ's mission,\" and that the lawsuit was \"without merit.\" The plaintiffs additionally claimed that under McKinzie ΑΚΑ lost large sums in investments. \nIn October 2009, legal counsel for ΑΚΑ sent a letter to the plaintiffs' attorneys demanding that a web site supporting the lawsuit be removed from the Internet, but the web site, Friends of the Weeping Ivy, remained online.\n\nAfter the lawsuit initially had been dismissed, an appeals court found in favour of the plaintiffs and reinstated the lawsuit. A subsequent audit led to findings which supported the assertions raised by the plaintiffs.\n\nAccording to ΑΚΑ's website, McKinzie has been expelled from the sorority since 2016. The sorority also won an arbitration award of $1.6 million against her, which (as of January 2017) was challenged by McKinzie in court.\n\n"}

{"id": "5345332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5345332", "title": "Christian counseling", "text": "Christian counseling\n\nChristian counseling is distinct from secular counseling. According to the International Association of Biblical Counselors, Biblical counseling \"seeks to carefully discover those areas in which a Christian may be disobedient to the principles and commands of Scripture and to help him learn how to lovingly submit to God's will.\" Christian counselors, therefore, approach psychology through the lens of the Bible. They see the Bible as the source of all truth.\n\nChristian counseling began in the end of the 1960s leading into the 1970s with the Biblical Counseling Movement directed by Jay E. Adams which brought to attention in his book \"Competent to Counsel\", a Christian-based approach which differed from the psychological and psychiatric solutions of the time. He was a devout Protestant who believed that it was the job of the church to heal people who he believed were morally corrupt, but labeled by society as mentally ill. He rejected other models of counseling, such as the medical model, which gave clients a medical diagnosis based on a list of their behaviors or actions. Adams believed the lists of maladaptive behaviors listed under each diagnostic category were actually behaviors emanating from our volitional nature, rather than an illness. Maladaptive behaviors are a matter of sin and therefore subject to confrontation and education in God's word, exhorting the client to choose behavior that is obedient to God's word, thus removing the sin in their life. Adams disagreed with any attempt to reclassify behavior that removed people from complete responsibility for their choices.\n\nAdams gained converts but also lost popularity among people as well.\nAdam's model of Nouthetic counseling identifies many scriptures that a counselor may use to exhort clients to change their behavior and come into obedience and away from sin. The term \"Nouthetic\" is derived from the Greek word \"noutheteo\", meaning \"to admonish\".\n\nPrior to this movement, counseling had become something more secular and not associated with the church. People such as Charles Darwin, who questioned the book of Genesis and how life began in his book \"Origin of Species\" published in 1859. This caused panic in the church because it called into question everything that the church believed at the time. Following in that direction, Later Wilhelm Wundt, a main contributor to the scientific method, introduced it to psychology and claimed that one's biological makeup was the reason why humans are the way they are. He was one of the main drivers behind psychology being looked at in the scientific realm. In addition to Wundt, Sigmund Freud believed that the church had failed to counsel in the correct way, so he came up with psychotherapy, \"the talking therapy\", apart from the church. These were driving factors behind why the responsibility of counseling was moved away from the church and began to be secularized. The Church began to fall behind the ever-changing scientific field that seemed to blossom quickly. When Adams did come along he brought the attention back to the church but his influence faded in the 1980s only to be continued by David Powlison. Powlison converted to Christianity in his adult life and was extremely influential in this movement, publishing a journal, the \"Journal of Biblical Counseling\", which made his beliefs known. Because of his work, Biblical counselors reflected on their movement and began to seek ways that it could improve which had never really been called to question before. His aim was to advance what had already been started by Adams.\n\nEfforts to combine counseling, psychotherapy or other scientific or academic endeavors with Christian or other religious perspectives or approaches are sometimes called \"integration\". Integration of academic subjects with theology has a long history in academia and continues in many colleges and universities that have continued their founding religious underpinnings. There are multiple kinds of integration, as it has been defined differently over the years. The way in which Christianity has been integrated with psychology thus far is by considering the ways in which psychology and the Bible agree and not integrating the teachings of psychology that don't agree with the Bible. While this tactic is still in progress and continuing to be looked at, there have been significant efforts to try and integrate the two. Stanton Jones and Richard Buteman came up with a list of three different methods on how to integrate psychology and the Christian faith. The methods are called pragmatic eclecticism, metatheoretical eclecticism, and theoretical integration. The first method, pragmatic eclecticism, looks at the best solutions for resolving patients' problems based on previous research comparing different methods that have been used. The second method is concerned with the effectiveness of the counselor and looks at the tactics they are using that are beneficial and those that are not. The third method takes theories that are previously existing and makes that the baseline from which further research can build upon. What all integrators of Christianity and psychology do believe as underlying truth is that all truth is God's truth.\n\nChristian counseling focuses on a few main principles. It focuses on the care of the whole person, body, soul and spirit, as it is also sometimes named \"soul-care\", and maintains the values taught in the Bible. The aim of Christian counseling is to help people regain a sense of hope for their life that is found in Jesus Christ. Christian counseling believes that at the core of what they do is to help others achieve a better understanding of themselves and God which is rooted in the Holy Spirit's conviction. Christian counselors seek to make people aware of the sin in their lives that has caused them suffering but also come to know the immense worth and value they have as a person to God.\n\nJay E. Adams published \"Competent to Counsel\" in 1970, criticizing the influence of psychology throughout Christian counseling. He began the Nouthetic counseling movement which teaches that the Bible alone is sufficient for all counseling. While Nouthetic counseling is strictly based on the Biblical scriptures and the power of the Holy Spirit separate from any psychological implementations, Christian counseling tries to implement psychology and Christianity still keeping God and biblical truths in the picture. While they do not take psychology as the absolute answer or solution to problems that people face, it is used as a tool in unity with Christianity to help people have a deeper understanding of themselves and God. Though some Christians do reject the teachings of science completely, others think that science and Christianity can be integrated, which Christian counseling aims to do.\n"}
{"id": "34829001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34829001", "title": "Corporate immune system", "text": "Corporate immune system\n\nThe term corporate immune system, or corporate immune response, refers to a process within corporations that demands organizations within the company accomplish activities in a certain way, a form of conformity tendencies. It is, in effect, the active form of groupthink, when the past outcome of groupthink processes forces itself on organizations that are otherwise different.\n\nThe term is most commonly used to describe such processes that drive out innovation and entrepreneurial activity within organizations. This is often found within in large multi-divisional companies, where it manifests itself as inter-divisional fighting, often subtle or unintended. Multinational corporations are particularly common examples, as divisional differences can be compounded by different corporate structures, languages and even time zones.\n\nThe term may refer to any organizational process that tends to drive out differences, or alternately demands conformity. The name refers to parallels with biological immune systems, which attempt to drive out \"foreign\" invaders and sometimes react negatively against the organism it is supposed to protect:\n\nThe essence of the term is the \"activity\" of driving out differences, as opposed to the natural \"tendency\" to do so.\n\nWithin any corporation, managers are presented with new projects and have to gain funding and staffing resources to implement them. These projects may be organizational in nature, implementing a new sales and inventory system for instance, or product related, like manufacturing and marketing a new toy. The process of introducing and implementing new ideas is a well studied area of business theory.\n\nAt any point in time, any particular manager might be presented with several new ideas, and has to choose which among these to promote. Implementation carries with it certain risks, both outright failure of the initiative, or through opportunity costs when some other initiative is not carried out due to conflicting needs or lack of resources. In larger companies, many managers will present ideas that have to compete for larger pools of resources, as decided on by upper management. Corporations normally have well-defined procedures for assessing these proposals, in order to decide among the many concepts so the most rewarding and viable projects gain support.\n\nIn an ideal corporation, the company would attempt to assess the proposal and decide whether or not to fund it based solely on its merits. Under these circumstances, it would be expected that most errors in this process would be the rejection of good ideas, rather than the approval of bad ones. This is because large corporations are typically dedicated to certain markets, and dedicate a large amount of their resources to improving the processes that address those markets in order to improve efficiency as well as competitiveness. Ideas for new products or markets are generally more risky, or at least more difficult to assess, than ideas that apply to the existing corporation, which is better understood. That is, corporations tend to focus on \"exploitation\", to the detriment of \"exploration\".\n\nReal-world companies rarely act in a manner that one might consider \"ideal\". Among the many problems that might cause a good idea to be rejected are a lack of resources, a lack of market understanding, and any number of external or internal factors. Corporate immune response may be one of these internal factors, manifesting itself as internecine fighting between divisions, or simply the rejection of ideas from divisions that are \"too different\" to be understood. In this context, it could be any of \"the set of organizational forces that suppress the advancement of creation-oriented activities such as initiatives.\"\n\nApple Computer has been a common example of the corporate immune response in action. During the late 1980s and the 1990s in particular, many ideas were promoted within the company, only to face severe attacks by other groups within the company. Many of these attacks were not based on real problems with the ideas, but more typically a perceived threat to the sales of an existing product. For instance, the Newton faced enormous problems within the company and almost caused its inventor to quit the company. Other frequently-cited examples in computing include Taligent, OpenDoc, Workplace OS, and the Star Trek project.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2788239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2788239", "title": "Derivative suit", "text": "Derivative suit\n\nA shareholder derivative suit is a lawsuit brought by a shareholder on behalf of a corporation against a third party. Often, the third party is an insider of the corporation, such as an executive officer or director. Shareholder derivative suits are unique because under traditional corporate law, management is responsible for bringing and defending the corporation against suit. Shareholder derivative suits permit a shareholder to initiate a suit when management has failed to do so. Because derivative suits vary the traditional roles of management and shareholders, many jurisdictions have implemented various procedural requirements to derivative suits.\n\nUnder traditional corporate business law, shareholders are the owners of a corporation. However, they are not empowered to control the day-to-day operations of the corporation. Instead, shareholders appoint directors, and the directors in turn appoint officers or executives to manage day-to-day operations.\n\nDerivative suits permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of the corporation against parties allegedly causing harm to the corporation. If the directors, officers, or employees of the corporation are not willing to file an action, a shareholder may first petition them to proceed. If such petition fails, the shareholder may take it upon himself to bring an action on behalf of the corporation. Any proceeds of a successful action are awarded to the corporation and not to the individual shareholders that initiate the action.\n\nIn recent years, “appraisal arbitrage” has developed as a form of shareholder litigation. Popular among hedge funds seeking to take advantage of favorable case law on valuation, such arbitrageurs buy shares in the target company of a transaction about to close and file suit claiming that the fair value of the company is higher than the ultimate price paid by the acquirer in the acquisition. The financial incentive is cashing in on a higher court-determined price plus default interest at 5% above the Federal Reserve discount rate, compounded quarterly.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, a shareholder must satisfy various requirements to prove that he has a valid standing before being allowed to proceed. The law may require the shareholder to meet qualifications such as the minimum value of the shares and the duration of the holding by the shareholder; to first make a demand on the corporate board to take action; or to post bond, or other fees in the event that he does not prevail.\n\nIn the United States, corporate law is based on state law. Although the laws of each state differ, the laws of the states such as Delaware, New York, California, and Nevada where corporations often incorporate, institute a number of barriers to derivative suits.\n\nGenerally in these states, and under the American Bar Association guidelines, the procedure of a derivative suit is as follows. First, eligible shareholders must file a demand on the board. The board may either reject, accept, or not act upon the demand. If after a period of time, days the demand has been rejected or has not been acted upon, shareholders may file suit. If the board accepts the demand, the corporation itself will file the suit. If rejected, or not acted upon, the shareholder must meet additional pleading requirements. On the requirements being met by the shareholder, the board may appoint a “special litigation committee” which may move to dismiss. If the special litigation committee makes a required showing, the case will be dismissed. If the committee fails to make a showing, the shareholder suit may proceed.\n\nThis model approach is followed to a greater or lesser degree among various states. In New York, for example, derivative suits must be brought to secure a judgment \"in [the corporation's] favor.\" Delaware has different rules in regards to demand and bond requirements too.\n\nThe famous case of \"Shaffer v. Heitner\", which ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court, originated with a shareholder derivative suit against Greyhound Lines.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, an action brought by a minority shareholder may not be upheld under the doctrine set out in \"Foss v Harbottle\" in 1843. Exceptions to the doctrine involve \"ultra vires\" and the \"fraud on minority\". According to Blair and Stout's \"Team Production Theory of Corporate Law\", the purpose of the suit is not to protect the shareholders, but to protect the corporation itself. Creditors, rather than shareholders, may bring an action, if a corporation faces insolvency.\n\nThe Companies Act 2006 provided a new procedure, but it did not reformulate the rule in \"Foss v Harbottle\". In England and Wales, the procedure slightly modified the pre-existing rules, and provided for a new preliminary stage at which a \"prima facie’’ case must be shown. In Scotland where there had been no clear rules on shareholder actions on behalf of the company, the Act sought to achieve a result similar to that in England and Wales.\n\n\nDerivative shareholder suits are extremely rare in continental Europe. The reasons probably lie within laws that prevent small shareholders from bringing lawsuits in the first place. Many European countries have company acts that legally require a minimum share in order to bring a derivative suit. Larger shareholders could bring lawsuits, however, their incentives are rather to settle the claims with the management, sometimes to the detriment of the small shareholders.\n\nIn New Zealand these can be brought under the Companies Act 1993 section 165 only with the leave of the court. It must be in the best interest of the company to have this action brought so benefits to company must outweigh the costs of taking action.\n\nIn India, derivative suits are brought under the clauses of oppression and mismanagement.\n\n"}

In fact, it has taken on many forms that address specific organizational constituencies (customers, channel partners, specialized service providers, employees, suppliers, etc.). The most obvious form is CRM (customer relationship management), which focuses on improving top-line growth by maximizing an organization's ability to identify sales and business opportunities with its customers. CRM's little brother PRM (partner relationship management), focuses on optimizing opportunity and downstream order management for an organization's channel partners (e.g. CISCO and its partner lead and referral management process) On the back end, we have ERP (enterprise resource planning) to manage internal operations including manufacturing, finance, HR, sales and distribution, etc. Specialized HRM (human resource management) solutions exist to manage employee benefits, collective agreements, performance reviews and so forth. And lastly, SCM (supply chain management, either as an ERP module or as a stand-alone application) to manage the product flow, up and down a firm's value chain, with external partners/suppliers.\nHowever, according to Galbreath (2002), \"for the most part CRM, human resources management (HRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management (SCM), partner relationship management (PRM) and similar programs have paid very little attention to the relationships that underpin those processes, or to the intangible – relationship – assets embedded in them.\"\n\nNorman and Ramirez (1993) state, \"One of the chief strategic challenges of the new economy is to integrate knowledge and relationships – devise a good fit between competencies (Competencies are the technologies, specialized expertise, business processes and techniques that a company has accumulated over time and packages in its offering) and customers and keep that fit current.\" Galbraeth (2002) adds that \"success in the relationship age requires a deliberate process of creating intangible, relationship assets, growing them and monetizing them\".\n\nGalbreath (2002) suggests that enterprise relationship management is a process that harmonizes and synergiezes different organizational relationships to realize targeted business benefits and goal. Harbison et al. (2000)did some research on the performance of alliances and cited the following statistics in their study:\n\nIn a similar study conducted for the supplier side (results of efficiently run supply chains based on electronic integration and quality processes) by Solomon Smith Barney Analyst Report, Teagarden (2000) presents the following statistics for suppliers:\n\nWhen looking at these numbers, collaboration with outside firms becomes very attractive. But success in business, as in many other pursuits, is dependent on motivation, investment, trust, discipline and repeatability.\n\nERM frameworks are needed because relationships are becoming prevalent and more integral to an organization's success. Although establishing inter-enterprise links is far from a new science, Klambach and Roussel (1999) affirm that nearly 60% of business alliances do not deliver anticipated benefits while Lovallo & Kahneman (2003) and Selden & Colvin (2003) estimate M&A ( Mergers & Acquisitions) failures range between 70% and 80%.\n\nWith statistics like these, the need to improve relationship success rates seems quite obvious. Many authors have addressed these issues from varying perspectives, including technology enabling a firm, reviewing or re-designing operational & administrative processes, and transforming the culture to one that is more adapted to collaboration. As Galbreath (2002) and Norman & Ramirez (1993) state, collaboration or rather the effective leveraging of relationship resources to create new sources of value, is a process of learning and developing new mental models and competencies (Senge, 1991) as well as obtaining resources through new means/sources.\n\nERM is still a relatively new field and few players stand-out with a complete ERM methodology and tools. Nevertheless, a host of best of breed tools and methodologies exist to carry out an ERM implementation, unfortunately they are not integrated and focus on very specialized problem areas. ERM tools can be viewed as enablers of an ERM methodology.\n\nFundamentally adopting ERM is a cultural and change management issue more than a technology or process one. Therefore, regardless of the methodology or tools that one may elect to use when integrating with outside firms, they must maintain a focus on the human side of the equations. The figure below illustrates the benefits of focusing on the human, cultural and change aspect of a project, notably deploying ERM in this case.\n\nRIIM (Relationship Intelligence and Influence Management) is a registered method of Perfluence. It is a systemic approach based on the assumption that each relationship can be seen as a linear combination of five different kind of common relationships. This method can be used \"stand alone\" or within the SaaS software PowerScope that carries each concept developed in the RiiM method. It enables an accurate and detailed vision of influence maps or relationship matrices, especially with graphic visualizations.\n\nVelox ERM is a product of Technology Partnerz. It integrates ONA - organizational network analysis, process re-design, IS/IT strategy, change management, supplier relationship management, customer relationship management, and risk and business continuity management into a comprehensive and simple framework that supports people and organizations in repeatably/consistently:\n\nAlso available in a searchable knowledge base tool that supports managers and business professionals to effectively understand and use collaborative best practices and accelerate the adoption of ERM.\n\n\n\n"}

Shortly after the end of the Second World War, Nishijima received a law degree from Tokyo University and began a career in finance. It was not until 1973, when he was in his mid-fifties, that Nishijima was ordained as a Buddhist priest. His preceptor for this occasion was Rempo Niwa, a former head of the Soto Zen sect. Four years later, Niwa gave him shiho, formally accepting him as one of his successors. Nishijima continued his professional career until 1979.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Nishijima began giving regular public lectures on Buddhism and Zen meditation. From the 1980s, he lectured in English and had a number of foreign students, including Mike Luetchford, his first Western Dharma Heir and founder of Dogen Sangha UK, Jeffrey Bailey, co-author with Nishijima of 'To Meet the Real Dragon,' American author Brad Warner, and teacher Jundo Cohen. In 2007, Nishijima and a group of his students organized as the Dogen Sangha International. In April 2012, Warner dissolved the organization.\n\nNishijima was the author of several books in Japanese and English. He was also a notable translator of Buddhist texts: working with student and Dharma heir Mike Chodo Cross, Nishijima compiled one of three complete English versions of Dōgen's ninety-five-fascicle \"Kana Shobogenzo\"; he also translated Dogen's \"Shinji Shōbōgenzō\". He also published an English translation of Nagarjuna's \"Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way\" (\"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\").\n\nNishijima had not been in good health for several years. It is reported by family that his final words, upon refusing further medical treatment, were, \"I decide my death time by myself.\" Nishijima was often heard to say in teaching that \"Life is just the fact in this moment; death is just the fact in this moment.\"\n\nWhile studying the \"Shōbōgenzō\", Nishijima developed a theory he called \"three philosophies and one reality,\" which presents his distinctive interpretation of the Four Noble Truths as well as explaining the structure of Dogen's writing. According to Nishijima, Dōgen carefully constructed the \"Shōbōgenzō\" according to a fourfold structure, in which he described each issue from four different perspectives. The first perspective is \"idealist,\" \"abstract,\" \"spiritual,\" and \"subjective\"; Nishijima says this is the correct interpretation of the first Noble Truth (in mainstream Buddhism, the first Noble Truth is \"dukkha\"). The second perspective is \"concrete,\" \"materialistic,\" \"scientific,\" and \"objective\" (in mainstream Buddhism, \"samudaya\"). The third perspective is described as an integration of the first two, producing a \"realistic\" synthesis (mainstream, \"nirodha\"). The fourth perspective is reality itself, which Nishijima argues cannot be contained in philosophy or stated in words, but which Dōgen attempts to suggest through poetry and symbolism. In mainstream Buddhism, the fourth Noble Truth is the Eightfold Path.\n\nNishijima stated that \"Buddhism is just Humanism\" and he explains Dogen's teaching on zazen in terms of balancing the autonomic nervous system.\n\n\n"}

It contains the interactions between the actors needed in order to turn an idea into a process, product, or service on the market.\n\nSystems of Innovation are frameworks for understanding innovation which have become popular particularly among policy makers and innovation researchers first in Europe, but now anywhere in the world as in the 90's the World Bank and other UN affiliated institutions accepted. The concept of a 'system of innovation' was introduced by B.-Å. Lundvall in 1985 “however, as he and his colleagues would be the first to agree (and as Lundvall himself points out), the idea actually goes back at least to the Friedrich List´s conception of “The National System of Political Economy” (1841), which might just as well have been called “The National System of Innovation” (Freeman, 1995). Christopher Freeman coined the expression \"National Innovation System\" or in his 1988 study of the success of the Japanese economy.\nThe concept, similarly used as \"National System of Innovation\" or \"National Innovation System\" was later applied to regions and sectors. According to innovation system theory, innovation and technology development are results of a complex set of relationships among actors in the system, which includes enterprises, universities and research institutes.\n\nInnovation systems have been categorized into national innovation systems, regional innovation systems, local innovation systems, technological innovation systems and sectoral innovation systems.\n\nThere is no consensus on the exact definition of an innovation system, and the concept is still emerging. Innovation is often the result of the interaction among an ecology of actors, and the term 'innovation ecosystem' is occasionally used to emphasize this. For some, the expression 'innovation ecosystem' is a subset or synonym of 'innovation system'. Others separate between the expressions, using the expression \"innovation system\" for labeling a planned innovation environment, and \"innovation ecosystem\" for an ecological innovation environment.\n\nRecently, the debate also started to study the problems that affect green innovation since in addition to the issues typical of innovation generally (such as market failures related to limited appropriability of economic benefits of knowledge), green growth innovation is also hindered by market failures related to the environment (pollution externalities). It is possible (and not uncommon) for an innovation system to successfully support innovation in many technology areas, but not in ones related to green growth. For this reason, it is necessary to focus on addressing both kinds of failures in order to drive innovation towards a green growth trajectory.\n\nA national system of innovation has been defined as follows:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "285182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285182", "title": "International Securities Identification Number", "text": "International Securities Identification Number\n\nAn International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) uniquely identifies a security. Its structure is defined in ISO 6166. The ISIN code is a 12-character alphanumeric code that serves for uniform identification of a security through normalization of the assigned National Number, where one exists, at trading and settlement.\n\nISINs were first used in 1981, but didn't reach wide acceptance until 1989, when the G30 countries recommended adoption. The ISIN was endorsed a year later by ISO with the ISO 6166 standard.\n\nInitially information was distributed via CD-ROMs and this was later replaced by distribution over the internet.\n\nIn 2004 the European Union mandated the use of instrument identifiers in some of its regulatory reporting, which included ISIN as one of the valid identifiers.\n\n\"ISO 6166\" (or ISO6166:2013 as of the 2013 revision) defines the structure of an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). An ISIN uniquely identifies a fungible security.\n\nSecurities with which ISINs can be used are:\n\nISINs consist of two alphabetic characters, which are the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the issuing country, nine alpha-numeric characters (the National Securities Identifying Number, or NSIN, which identifies the security, padded as necessary with leading zeros), and one numerical check digit. They are thus always 12 characters in length. When the NSIN changes due to corporate actions or other reasons, the ISIN will also change. Issuance of ISINs is decentralized to individual national numbering agencies (NNAs). Since existing national numbering schemes administered by the various NNAs form the basis for ISINs, the methodology for assignment is not consistent across agencies globally.\n\nAn ISIN cannot specify a particular trading location, or another identifier, typically a MIC (Market Identifier Code) or the three-letter exchange code, will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN. The currency of the trade will also be required to uniquely identify the instrument using this method.\n\nSince 1989, when ISINs were introduced, they have slowly gained traction worldwide in their usage.\n\nISINs are being introduced worldwide and are the most popular global securities identifier. Trading, clearing and settlement systems in many countries have adopted ISINs as a secondary measure of identifying securities. Some countries, mainly in Europe, have moved to using the ISIN as their primary means of identifying securities. In addition new European regulations such as Solvency II increasingly require the ISIN to be reported.\n\nThe ISIN is generally included in services sold by financial data vendors and intermediaries. These services are normally paid services as more value added data is included with the information. In general, the issuer of a security will include the ISIN in issuance papers or other documentation for identification purposes.\n\nIn 2009, Standard & Poor's was formally charged by the European Commission (EC) with abusing its position in licensing international securities identification codes for United States securities by requiring European financial firms and data vendors to pay licensing fees for their use. \"This behaviour amounts to unfair pricing\", the EC said in its statement of objections which lays the groundwork for an adverse finding against S&P. \"The (numbers) are indispensable for a number of operations that financial institutions carry out – for instance, reporting to authorities or clearing and settlement – and cannot be substituted”.\n\nIn 2011, Standard and Poor's provided six undertakings to the European Commission to remedy the situation. The agreement is applicable to all consuming companies in the European Economic Area. These expired at the end of 2016.\n\nThe examples below describes one approach for applying the Luhn algorithm on two different ISINs. The difference in the two examples has to do with if there are an odd or even number of digits after converting letters to number. Since the NSIN element can be any alpha numeric sequence (9 characters), an odd number of letters will result in an even number of digits and an even number of letters will result in an odd number of digits. For an odd number of digits, the approach in the first example is used. For an even number of digits, the approach in the second example is used. The Luhn algorithm can also be applied in the same manner for both types or lengths (alternating multiply the string of digits by 1 and 2, starting from the end of the string), being more generic.\n\nApple, Inc.: ISIN US0378331005, expanded from CUSIP 037833100\nThe main body of the ISIN is the original CUSIP, assigned in the 1970s.

Some protocols require the transmission of additional check digits added to the full ISIN number.\n\n\n"}

Heineken Chaired Professor of marketing at INSEAD, a post he has held since 1993. He is known for his pioneering work in the use of computer simulations (i.e. simulation games) in marketing training, his work at INSEAD on marketing excellence and customer focus, and his book \"The Momentum Effect\".\n\nLarréché received his degree for Ingénieur en électronique from INSA, Lyon in 1968, his MSc in Computer Science from the University of London in 1969, his MBA, INSEAD and his PhD at the Graduate School of Business of the Stanford University.\n\nAfter completing his MBA in 1970 Larreche was working as a research assistant an INSEAD when he was asked to assist L’Oreal assess a computerised marketing model they were considering purchasing. He was fascinated by it and \"decided to investigate the best places in the world to study marketing modelling.\" . Larréché is quoted as saying that he chose Stanford for his PhD so that he could study under Dave Montgomery, one of the founders of marketing modelling.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1977, working with an assistant, Hubert Gatignon, he developed his work on marketing modelling to create a teaching simulation called Markstrat . Markstrat is a game where teams of students compete against each other in an artificial world under realistic market conditions. It is claimed that Markstrat is now used in 8 out of the top 10 business schools in the world and 25 of the top 30 schools in the US.. More recently he developed the simulation DiG - Discovery Innovation Growth a versatile learning tool to develop competencies in innovation, customer centricity, value based marketing, business acumen, leadership and team performance (). \n\nIn 1983, at the age of just 36 Larréché was appointed to the board of Reckitt & Coleman (now Reckitt Benckiser plc) in a non-executive role after previously working for the firm in a consultancy capacity . He remained on the board for 18 years. He founded a consultancy business, StratX, in 1984. . The company currently offers experiential learning programs for top corporations and universities worldwide.\n\nDuring the 1990s Larreche’s work began to concentrate on the underlying capabilities that impact on a business’s ability to compete in the marketplace. He published a series of reports based on surveys conducted with more than 1200 executives in hundreds of Fortune 1000 companies. The surveys attempted to define and evaluate the attributes, characteristics and behaviours of large global firms and assess their impact on corporate performance. That work, combined with computer modelling and his long-time work on customer focus, converged on the concept of “momentum” – an attempt to map out a process for improving the efficiency of a firm’s growth. The culmination of this period of Larreche’s work was the publication in 2008 of \"The Momentum Effect: How to ignite exceptional growth\" .\n\nHe received the following awards:\n\n\n"}

He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 5 October 2004 until 30 September 2009. He was the first Vice-Chancellor to be elected from outside Oxford's academic body in 900 years, and the first to have addressed the scholars' congregation via a webcast. In March 2007 New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark awarded him the World Class New Zealand supreme award to honour his contribution to profiling New Zealand and New Zealanders internationally. On 15 November 2007 he announced that he would not seek an extension to his five-year term as Vice Chancellor, and that he would leave Oxford in September 2009.\n\nBorn on 2 January 1952 in Napier, New Zealand, Hood attended Westlake Boys High School in Auckland, where a house has been named after him (Hood House).\n\nDuring 1970 and 1976, Hood attended the University of Auckland, where he graduated with a B.E. in 1972 and a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering in 1976. He then won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, where he resided in Worcester College and studied for an M.Phil. in Management. He won a Blue playing squash for Oxford University and also played first-class cricket for Oxford University in 1977.\n\nHe has held a number of directorships in prominent New Zealand companies and bodies, including Fonterra, Fletcher Challenge and the New Zealand Cricket review of 1995. His career at Fletcher Challenge is described in the book \"Battle of the Titans\" by Bruce Wallace. From 1998–2004, he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Auckland.\n\nHood's term as vice-chancellor of Oxford has been the subject of controversy. Hood had proposed to reform the 900-year-old tradition of complete self-governance by introducing a number of external members to council, and by separating academic and financial boards. The initial proposal called for a majority of external members of council, bringing Oxford into line with all other UK universities except the University of Cambridge. Following a two-hour debate, the proposal was amended by Congregation to allow the election of a fellow insider to the council within five years, resulting in a majority of eight insiders (including the vice-chancellor) to the 15-member council. The amendment was supported by a majority of votes (657 to 502), with both supporters and opponents of the reforms claiming victory. \n\nThe amended proposal was brought to vote by Congregation on 28 November 2006, and was defeated by 730 to 456 votes. A postal vote was called on 5 December, with ballots being sent to all 3000 members of Congregation and votes being accepted until 18 December. On 19 December it was announced that the proposal had once again been defeated, this time by 1540 to 997 votes. Hood stated that he would not treat the defeat as a vote of no confidence, citing a need to \"put aside division, continue dialogue with all shades of opinion and, in an atmosphere of trust, tolerance and goodwill, promote the academic aims and ideals of Oxford\".\n\nThe proposed reform met with opposition not because it would invite outside opinion on the university's financial and academic decisions, but because of the impression that control would be wrested from Congregation, thus threatening the university's academic reputation. Furthermore, some opponents claimed that the reform would place too much power in the hands of the vice-chancellor. Other critics questioned the applicability of corporate models of governance in educational institutions. Lord Patten of Barnes has stated that without reforms to Oxford's governance it will be more difficult to raise money that the university needs to advance, particularly with respect to needs-based funding to support students from poorer backgrounds. Similarly, Hood has stated that the issue is not \"whether there has to be change, but what kind of change.\"\n\nOthers have criticised the appointment of the Registrar, Julie Maxton, who is noted to be a former colleague of Hood. Maxton was chosen for the position of Registrar by way of a selection committee including consultants, external members of council, and the vice-chancellor of Cambridge.\n\nComparisons have been drawn with Lawrence Summers, the 27th President of Harvard University, who announced his resignation on 21 February 2006 following two motions of censure. Although individual academic staff have been critical of John Hood no formal motions were brought forward calling for his resignation. However, an informal letter of confidence organised by his supporters in February 2006 attracted around 50 signatories from Members of Congregation. Contested elections to the Council of the University by Congregation have resulted in the election of three leading critics of Hood's proposals, namely Susan Cooper in 2005, Nicholas Bamforth in 2006 and Donald Fraser who was elected unopposed, also in 2006.\n\nIn June 2007 it was revealed that the University press office had been monitoring and editing comments in Hood's Wikipedia article in an attempt to protect his reputation. In the same month, two further critics of Hood, Colin Thompson and Peter Robbins, were elected to the Council.\n\nAndrew Hamilton, who had previously served as the Provost of Yale University, was nominated on 3 June 2008 to succeed John Hood as Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University from 1 October 2009.\n\nHe is a non-executive director of BG Group Plc, and will be President and Chief Executive Officer of the Robertson Foundation from 2010.\n\nIn December 2011, John Hood became Chair of Rhodes Trustees.\n\nIn January 2012, the board of global private education provider Study Group appointed John Hood as chairman.\n\nIn the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours, Hood was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM) for services to tertiary education.\n\nHood has two daughters (Anna and Nina Hood) and son (Thomas Hood).\n\n\n"}

Six men died in three separate crashes, and another three were injured in a fourth crash. \nThe Prize occasioned considerable investment in aviation, sometimes many times the value of the prize itself, and advancing public interest and the level of aviation technology.\nThe Orteig Prize was a $25,000 reward () offered on May 22, 1919, by New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig to the first allied aviator(s) to fly non-stop from New York City to Paris or vice versa. The offer was in the spirit of several similar aviation prize offers, and was made in a letter to Alan Ramsay Hawley, president of the Aero Club of America at the behest of Aero Club secretary Augustus Post.\n\nGentlemen: As a stimulus to the courageous aviators, I desire to offer, through the auspices and regulations of the Aero Club of America, a prize of $25,000 to the first aviator of any Allied Country crossing the Atlantic in one flight, from Paris to New York or New York to Paris, all other details in your care.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRaymond Orteig\nThe Aero Club replied on May 26 with Orteig confirming his offer three days later. His offer was accepted by the Aero Club and Augustus Post set up a formal structure to administer the competition.\nCoincidentally, just a few weeks later Alcock and Brown successfully completed the first non-stop crossing of the Atlantic from Newfoundland to Ireland, winning an earlier prize offer, and in late June the British airship R34 made an east-west crossing from East Fortune, Scotland, to Long Island, New York, returning by the same route in early July.\n\nOn offer for five years, the goal of the prize seemed beyond the capacity of aircraft of the time and the prize attracted no competitors. After its original term had expired Orteig reissued the prize on June 1, 1925 by depositing $25,000 in negotiable securities at the Bryant Bank with the awarding put under the control of a seven-member board of trustees. By then the state of aviation technology had advanced to the point that numerous competitors vied for the prize.\n\nIn 1926 the first serious attempt on the prize was made by a team led by French flying ace René Fonck, backed by Igor Sikorsky, the aircraft designer. Sikorsky, who put $100,000 towards the attempt, built an aircraft, the S-35, for the purpose, and in September that year Fonck, with three companions, made their flight. However the aircraft was hopelessly overloaded and crashed in flames attempting to take off. Fonck and his co-pilot, Curtin, survived, but his companions, Clavier and Islamoff, were killed.\n\nBy 1927 three groups in the United States and one in Europe were known to be preparing attempts on the prize.\n\nFrom the US:\n\nMeanwhile, in France, Charles Nungesser and François Coli were preparing for an east-west crossing in a Levasseur aircraft, \"L'Oiseau Blanc\".\n\nIn April 1927 the various teams assembled and prepared for their attempts, but all suffered mishaps.\n\nChamberlin and Acosta undertook a series of flights, increasing \"Columbia's\" weight as they went to test the aircraft's capability and to simulate the planned takeoff weight. They also simulated the duration of the flight, setting an endurance record in the process. However their attempt was riven with arguments, between Levine and the others, resulting in Acosta leaving the team for Byrd's and his replacement, Lloyd Bertaud, taking legal action against Levine over a contract dispute.\n\nByrd's team also made preparations. Wanamaker had the Roosevelt Field improved (Fonck's crash had been caused in part by the aircraft hitting a sunken road running across the runway) while Byrd had a ramp built for \"America\" to roll down on takeoff, providing extra impetus. However, on 8 April Byrd's team, in \"America\", crashed during a test flight; Bennet was injured and unable to continue.\n\nOn 26 April Davis and Wooster, in \"American Legion\", also crashed on a test flight; this time both were killed.\n\nOn 8 May Nungesser and Coli set off from Paris in \"L'Oiseau Blanc\" to attempt an east-west crossing, a more difficult proposition given the prevailing winds; they were last seen off the coast of Ireland, but never arrived in New York and no trace of them was ever found, creating one of aviation's great mysteries.\n\nMeanwhile, a late challenge, by solo flyer Charles Lindbergh in Ryan aircraft \"Spirit of St. Louis\", and backed by bankers in St. Louis, Missouri, was started in February, with Lindbergh arriving at Roosevelt Field in mid-May.\n\nLindbergh had chosen to fly solo, although this was not a requirement of the prize and required him to be at the controls for more than 30 hours. Following a period of bad weather, and before it had sufficiently cleared, Lindbergh took off for Paris, stealing a march on his rivals.\n\nLindbergh pursued a risky strategy for the competition; instead of using a tri-motor, as favored by most other groups, he decided on a single engined aircraft. The decision allowed him to save weight and carry extra fuel as a reserve for detours or emergencies. He also decided to fly the aircraft solo, so avoiding the personality conflicts that helped delay at least one group. To save weight which had contributed to the crashes of other contributors, Lindbergh also dispensed with non-essential equipment like radios, sextant, and a parachute, although he did take an inflatable raft. The final factor in his success was his decision to fly into weather conditions that were clearing but not clear enough for others to consider safe. Lindbergh was quoted as saying \"What kind of man would live where there is no danger? I don't believe in taking foolish chances. But nothing can be accomplished by not taking a chance at all.\"\n\nAfter Lindbergh's success, the other teams had to re-evaluate their aims. \nChamberlin decided to attempt a flight to Berlin, which his endurance flight had shown to be achievable, and for which the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce were offering a $15,000 prize. On 4 June Chamberlin (and, at the last minute, Levine) took off in \"Columbia\" for Berlin; they arrived over Germany after a flight of 42 hours but were unable to find their way to the city and landed, out of fuel, at Eisleben, 60 miles to the south-west. They finally arrived in Berlin on 7 June.\n\nByrd, meanwhile, announced his aim was not simply the prize, but “to demonstrate that the world was ready for safe, regular, multi-person flight across the Atlantic” and that he would head for Paris, as planned. He and his crew, Acosta, Noville and, as a late addition, Bernt Balchen (who actually did most of the flying) set off in \"America\" for Paris on 29 June. However, after a 40-hour flight they were unable to find the airfield at Le Bourget and turned back to ditch on the coast, landing at Ver-sur-Mer, Normandy, on 1 July.\n\nAdvancing public interest and aviation technology, the Prize occasioned investments many times the value of the prize. In addition, lives were lost by men who were competing to win the prize. Six men died in three separate crashes. Another three men were injured in a fourth crash. During the spring and summer of 1927, 40 pilots attempted various long-distance over-ocean flights, leading to 21 deaths during the attempts. For example, seven lives were lost in August 1927 in the Orteig Prize-inspired $25,000 Dole Air Race to fly from San Francisco to Hawaii.\n\n1927 saw a number of aviation first and new records. The record for longest time in the air, longest flight distance, and longest overwater flight were set and all exceeded Lindbergh's effort. However, no other flyer gained the fame that Lindbergh did for winning the Orteig Prize.\n\nThe Orteig Prize inspired the $10 million Ansari X Prize for repeated suborbital private spaceflights. Similar to the Orteig Prize, it was announced some eight years before it was won in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Allen\n\nRay Robert Allen (July 5, 1920 – April 6, 2010) was a municipal public official and banker in Alexandria, Louisiana, who, in 1977, was secretary-treasurer and then finance director when the city converted from the commissioner to the mayor-council form of government.\n\nAllen was born in Yell County, Arkansas, to Frank F. Allen and the former Martha Walker. The family moved to Tensas Parish in northeastern Louisiana, where Allen graduated from the since defunct Newellton High School in Newellton. He served in the United States Army Air Corps. Allen studied accounting at Alexandria Business College and LaSalle Extension University, a correspondence school based in Chicago.\n\nIn 1947, Allen began his municipal tenure as a cashier and then an accountant in the Alexandria finance department. From 1963-1977, while he was the Alexandria secretary-treasurer, the city budget grew from $9 million to $40 million. His municipal service spanned the administrations of Mayors Carl B. Close (1947–1953), W. George Bowdon, Jr. (1953–1969), Ed Karst (1969–1973), John K. Snyder (first term from 1973–1977), and Carroll E. Lanier (first two years, 1977–1979).\n\nAt the time of his retirement from the city service in January 1979, Allen told the \"Alexandria Daily Town Talk\" that some mayors and commissioners had objected when he prevented their utilization of city funds for questionable purposes. At the time, Allen said, \"Everybody wanted the city finances for something different. Everybody had a pet project ... If some of them had had their way, they'd have taken all of the city's money and put it in their own special projects and left nothing for anyone else. So it was a continual war keeping them from gaining control of the finances of the city,\" Allen said.\n\nAllen noted that different city commissioner often pressured him to permit spending of funds for their own projects: \"I made a lot of people mad by following the law. They wanted to get rid of me, and if I played the political game, they might have. They were looking for ways to put me in jail, but I followed the law, and they couldn’t do it. I won my battle, and they lost.\"\n\nHe credited Lanier with bringing stability to municipal finances, both as finance and utilities commissioner from 1969–1973 and as mayor for a five-and one-half-year term beginning in 1977. Lanier was unseated as commissioner in 1973 by businessman and attorney Arnold Jack Rosenthal, who thereafter convinced the council to hire Velda Mae LaBorde Lee (1935–2011) of rural Flatwoods in Rapides Parish as an internal auditor to check Allen's financial practices. Formerly of Union Parish in north Louisiana, Lee was an honor graduate of Louisiana Tech University and obtained a master's degree in accounting from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. She was only the second woman in Louisiana to obtain CPA designation. Later she was finance director in the second Snyder administration.<\n\nWhen Rosenthal criticized Allen for \"insubordination\", as reported by \"The Town Talk\", Allen sued for defamation but won no judgment. Snyder fired Allen in 1977, but Lanier quickly elevated him to the new finance director position. Lanier was unseated by Snyder in 1982, who served a second four-year term amid much controversy.\n\nIn 1970, Allen received the Charles E. Dunbar Jr., Career Service Award from the Louisiana Civil Service League for his service as secretary-treasurer.\n\nAfter leaving city service, Allen was affiliated with First Bank for ten years, having retired as a bank officer. He also worked as an accountant for Petron Inc., and he did bookkeeping for the Masonic Children's Home in Alexandria.\nAllen was a deacon at the large Calvary Baptist Church in Alexandria and a former member of Parkview Baptist Church. He was often called upon to lead the invocation at city council meetings. He was affiliated with the Masonic lodge. A superior ping pong player, Allen often competed with students at Louisiana College in Pineville. He died of natural causes at the age of eighty-nine at his Alexandria residence at 3807 Gingerbread Road. He was predeceased by his wife, the former Lily Hinds (February 4, 1928 – September 19, 2007, a daughter of Mumford Hinds (1888-1971) and the former Lola Walker of Ajax, an unincorporated community in Natchitoches Parish. Ray and Lily married in Shreveport; their mothers coincidentally had the maiden name \"Walker\" but were unrelated.\n\nThe Allens were survived by two daughters. Gale Allen Henry (born December 1947) of Kansas City, Missouri, was previously married to Robert Paul \"Bob\" Devenney (1948-2002), the father of two of the Allens' four grandchildren, Brent Christopher Devenney (born 1970), a Southern Baptist pastor in South Burlington, Vermont, and Chad Joseph Devenney (born 1975) of Kansas City. Bob Devenney is interred beside his parents at Resthaven Memorial Gardens and Mausoleum in Baton Rouge. Gale subsequently married Charles Bender Henry, Sr. (1939-2013), a deputy with the Ouachita Parish Sheriff's Department in Monroe who died at the age of seventy-three after a long battle with cancer.\n\nThe younger daughter, Deborah Ray Allen Poirrier (born April 1952) of Baton Rouge, is the widow of businessman James Alton \"Jim\" Poirrier (1937-2001). Known as Debbie Poirrier, she was previously married to Michael W. \"Mike\" Wiley (1948-2003), an Alexandria native who was the chief juvenile detective and the 2001 \"Deputy of the Year\" for the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Department. A board member of the Renaissance Home for Youth and the Boys & Girls Clubs of Alexandria, Wiley died at the age of fifty-five of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He was the father of the other two Allen grandchildren, Mason Allen Wiley (born 1972) of DeRidder in Beauregard Parish, and Melissa Ashley Wiley Despino (born 1973) of Alexandria. At the time of the Allens' deaths, Melissa was married to Tommy Ray Bergeron.

{"id": "37202014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37202014", "title": "Robert Godlonton", "text": "Robert Godlonton\n\nRobert Godlonton (1794–1884) (\"Moral Bob\") was an influential politician of the Cape Colony.\n\nHe was an 1820 Settler, who developed the press of the Eastern Cape and led the Eastern Cape separatist movement as a representative in the Cape's Legislative Council.\n\nRobert Godlonton was born in London on 24 September 1794. He was a weak and sickly child and after he was orphaned at the age of twelve he was apprenticed at a printing office.\n\nHe emigrated to the Cape as part of the 1820 settlers, taking with him a small printing press. However the British Governor, fearing the beginnings of a free press, confiscated the press and compensated the price.\n\nAfter unsuccessful attempts at farming, he became a clerk at a landdrost's office and was gradually promoted over the next ten years.\n\nThe Cape was finally given freedom of the press in 1828, due largely to the efforts of the journalist and politician John Fairbairn. In 1834 Godlonton became partner in the \"Grahamstown Journal\" and in 1839 he took over the business. The firm, now renamed Godlonton & White, became the leading newspaper in the Eastern Cape. He eventually developed a wide range of business interests, but his primary activity remained newspapers and the printing industry. He gained a controlling stake in the Kingwilliamstown Gazette, the Uitenhage Times, the Queenstown Free Press, the Eastern Province Herald, the Eastern Province Monthly Magazine, the Friend of Bloemfontein, and Het Grahamstads Register en Boeren-vriend.\n\nWith the time and resources of his business success, he able to concentrate on additional personal publications, such as \"Narrative of the Irruption of the Kafir Hordes (1836)\" and \"Notes on the Separation of the Eastern from the Western Province\", proposing a stronger colonial policy against the neighbouring Xhosa people and calling for more British immigration to the Eastern Cape to bolster its White population.\n\nGodlonton began to involve himself in politics soon after he arrived in the Cape. He took an active role in the frontier wars as member of the board of defence and, although never elected a municipal commissioner, he diligently attended town and committee meetings in the area.\nLater, as his business enterprises grew, he began to take a much stronger role in Cape politics.\n\nGodlonton's early political career was taken up by a long campaign against the Lieutenant-Governor of the Eastern Cape, Andries Stockenström.\n\nStockenström, who professed considerable respect for the Xhosa, had developed a completely new frontier policy that involved the exchange of diplomatic agents as reliable \"ambassadors\" between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa Chiefs. This system was underlain by formal treaties to guard the border and return any stolen cattle from either side. Importantly, Stockenström forbade colonial expansion into Xhosa land. With this key provision, the treaty system soon brought a degree of peace to the frontier.\n\nHowever many frontier colonists resented Stockenström's restrictions on their expansion into Xhosa land. As one settler ominously remarked of the Xhosa lands: \"The appearance of the country is very fine, it will make excellent sheep farms.\"\n\nGodlonton swiftly came to the forefront as the leader of this Eastern Cape settler movement. He used his newspapers to condemn Stockenström's treaty system and advocate seizing the Xhosa lands. He also used his considerable influence in the religious institutions of the 1820 British settlers to drive his opinions, declaring that: \"the British race was selected by God himself to colonise Kaffraria\". In the face of massive pressure and ruinous lawsuits, Stockenström was eventually dismissed and his treaty system was dismantled by the new British Governor, Maitland. A fresh wave of frontier violence soon developed, eventually building up to the Amatola War which broke out in 1846.\n\nStockenström died soon afterwards but crucially, Godlonton's attacks on him and his treaty system made an opponent of Stockenström's friend and ally John Molteno, who would come to confront Godlonton's political movement decades later.\n\nFrom his leadership of the frontier settlers' attacks on Stockenstrom's treaty system, Godlonton had acquired a very prominent and powerful position in the Eastern Cape.\nIn the 1840s he thus began to take on the role of self-appointed leader of the Eastern Cape separatist movement. This movement accused the Cape Town-based government of being overly lenient in its frontier policy, and called for the political capital to be moved to a city nearer the frontier or, barring that, for the white Eastern Cape to be allowed to secede as a separate state. It also supported greater British imperial involvement in southern Africa.\n\nIn 1849 – 50 Godlonton took a controversial stand in support of the British Governor's attempt to use the Cape as a penal colony. In the wake of this \"Convict Crisis\", the Governor appointed him to the Cape's Legislative Council, resulting in the other Council members resigning en masse in protest. Godlonton also unsuccessfully opposed the implementation of the multi-racial Cape Qualified Franchise in 1851/2.\n\nIn 1854, the Cape was granted its first parliament, with the old Legislative Council becoming an elected upper house – sharply divided between representatives of the Eastern and Western Cape. Godlonton represented the Eastern Cape in this new Legislative Council for the next 25 years.\n\nIn the new parliament, Godlonton led the separatist cause in the upper house of parliament, while his colleague John Paterson led the movement in the lower house.\n\nMeanwhile, Stockenström's old protege, Molteno, claiming direct British rule in southern Africa to be unjust and inept, was leading a growing movement for \"Responsible Government\", to make the Cape's Executive democratically accountable (or \"responsible\" as it was known), and thus give the Cape a degree of independence from Britain. As this movement grew in power throughout the 1860s, Godlonton redirected his considerable resources towards opposing it. Finally, as a member of the Legislative Council, he chaired the 1871 \"Commission on Federal Devolution\" in a last-ditch attempt to split the Cape and weaken the Responsible Government movement, but the following year Molteno gained parliamentary control and became the Cape's first Prime Minister.\n\nThe new Prime Minister immediately included several representatives of the Eastern Cape into his government. This, together with the rising economic prosperity of the Cape and the \"Seven Circles Bill (May 1874)\" finally extinguished the separatist movement.\nGodlonton was permitted to retain his parliamentary seat until its dissolution in 1878.\n\nGodlonton's role as the press advocate of Eastern Cape frontier opinion mirrored the powerful role that John Fairbairn (and later Saul Solomon) played as leading press advocates of Western Cape liberal opinion.\n\nHe was immensely influential for his work in elaborating on and immortalising the trials and grievances of the British frontier settlers. His influence on frontier historiography was far greater than his effects on the affairs of his day. During his lifetime his political movement was largely thwarted, and he was eventually out-maneuvered by his Western Cape opponents, nonetheless in years to come his legacy was to survive and influence the expansionist policies of the later Progressive Party.\n\nRobert Godlonton was outspoken in his beliefs and earned the nickname \"Moral Bob\". He was a staunch Methodist, like a great many of the 1820 settlers of the Eastern Cape, who was strongly involved in Church and Missionary activity. He was a prominent leader of the Cape's Methodist community, friends with other powerful churchmen such as John Ayliff, Henry Hare Dugmore and Henry Calderwood among others and, together with such men, formed a powerful business clique. They also formed the majority of the municipal commissioners in the Eastern Cape.\n\nHis first wife, Mary Ann, died in 1844, and the following year he married his second wife Sarah Richards.\n\nHe died in Grahamstown on 30 May 1884.\n\n\n\n"}

He was educated in the Ukraine at the Institute of Railway Transport Engineers (currently Dnipropetrovsk National University of Rail Transport), graduating in 1979 with a diploma in electromechanical engineering. From 1979 till 1988 he worked with Belarusian Railway and then with Minsk Metro as chief engineer, following which in 1988 he began a career in private business.\n\nPeftiev's business interests since leaving Minsk Metro have included technological development, special equipment and military exports, telecommunications, medical technology, IT- technology, and sports\n\n\nDuring the past few years, Peftiev has disposed of some of his business assets, including his shareholding in BelTechExport and Delovaya Set, and restructured his remaining business interests. He now owns 31% of Sport Pari, with the remainder held by a company belonging to the family of well-known tennis player and 2012 Olympic Champion Maxim Mirnyi.\n\nIn 2011, after the wave of repressions that followed the 2010 presidential election in Belarus, the Council of the European Union listed Peftiev and his three companies BelTechExport, Sport Pari and BT Telecommunications as sanctioned entities. In the Council's decision, Peftiev has been described as follows:\n\nPeftiev protested the Council's decision in the General Court of the European Union. The team that defended Vladimir Peftiev in court included world famous specialists in the field of human rights, including: professor of Yale University and former President of Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Michael Reisman and former Director of International Law department of University of Bonn, General Director of the office of the Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl from 1992 to 1996, professor Rudolf Dolzer. At the end of October 2014, before the case had been decided, the sanctions were dropped by the EU Council. On 9 December 2014, the General Court of European Union decided in Peftiev’s and his companies’ favour, annulling the sanctions and ruling that the Council of the European Union and European Commission had made serious mistakes while evaluating Peftiev's business activities. That was mentioned by professor Dolzer in his interview on May 8, 2018 to Latvian newspaper “Dienas bizness”, in which he pointed out to the false information in the Internet that was used against Vladimir Peftiev, and namely with regard to illegal incomes of Mr. Peftiev, his Forbes rating, weapons exports to North Korea, Ivory Coast and China, his sponsoring of Lukashenko. The Council did not appeal the Court's decision.\n\nThe European General Court’s judgment of 9 December 2014 concerning Peftiev reads, in part (clause 149):\nThis decision of European General Court was left unattended by mass media. Moreover, various sources continued to publish disproved information that originated before or during of sanctions, instead of deleting it from their servers according to the court’s decision. This was described by Professor Rudolf Dolzer in his article «Weeding Out Fake Journalism» for 10th issue of Forbes Georgia:\nPevtiev was mentioned in the Bahamas offshore leaks in 2016: allegedly, he held three companies in Bahamas through an intermediary.\n\nDuring his career to date, Peftiev has contributed research and development to a number of new technologies in mechanical engineering and medicine, of which fourteen have been awarded patents under his name. In his research and development work, Peftiev has cooperated with such Belarusian scientists as Vladimir Alexandrovich Katko and Sergey Vladimirovich Pletnev.\n\nPeftiev supports a variety of social, cultural and religious-heritage projects.\n\nIn 1995, Peftiev founded a youth tennis club in Minsk which he financed and continued to support until 2011. The club helped to recruit highly qualified trainers for talented up-and-coming players, and provided financial assistance and a sports centre to promote national youth tennis. Peftiev was the main sponsor of Victoria Azarenka, Olympic tennis champion and former world No. 1, at the beginning of her career.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, Peftiev also headed the Belarus Tennis Federation.\n\nPeftiev's contributions to the preservation of Orthodox Christian heritage have been recognised with awards from the Orthodox Church. Since 1998, he has been a member of the Tutorial Board for construction of the Orthodox Church of All Saints and Innocent Victims in Minsk (under the aegis of the Belarusian Orthodox Church). He assisted in the construction of the House of Mercy in Minsk and is a leading sponsor of the Nikolsky Orthodox Church in Tonezh (completed 2015), built to commemorate the site of a Nazi atrocity.\n\nDuring 2012–2015, Peftiev sponsored the mural paintings in St John the Baptist's Church of the Monastery of the Holy Ascension in Barkalabovo (Belarus) carried out by students and professors of the Monumental Art Department of the Belarusian State Academy of Arts in a team headed by Belarusian artist Vladimir Zinkevich.\n\nVladimir Peftiev is a Chevalier of Orders of the Russian Orthodox Church, a Chevalier of the Order of the Belorussian Orthodox Church, and has also been decorated by the Orthodox Metropolitan of Switzerland.\n\nPeftiev has sponsored and in some cases co-authored a number of art and historical publications, chiefly in the historical series В поисках утраченного [‘In search of the lost’] by Belorussian historian Vladimir Lihodedov, volumes of which include:\n\nPeftiev has also co-authored:\nIn 2017 a book of maxims by Vladimir Peftiev titled \"Maxims of a Man of Schemes\" was published with a foreword by the British philosopher and author A. C. Grayling. The foreword says:These striking, amusing and sometimes pungent aphorisms are so full of a certain kind of pragmatic wisdom that I am moved to quote Professor Higgins on Mr Alfred Doolittle: that the latter was \"the most original moralist\" that the former had encountered for many years. The hard truths of practical life are apt to wring from people of experience a view of how to navigate the maze of routes that lies between desire and success; it is not, invariably, a view for the faint-hearted or those persuaded more by Aristotle than Gordon Gekko; but it will certainly strike a chord with many who have ventured that maze, and will certainly provide a preparation – and for some a warning – to those planning or wishing to do so. No-one can fail to profit, therefore – in at least one relevant sense of that term – from these maxims, offered by one who has been all the way through that maze and back. Peftiev’s contributions are helping to preserve the memory of Belarusian soldiers and fighters who fell in the Polish and Lithuanian uprisings of the nineteenth century, the Russian-French War of 1812 (the Patriotic War of 1812), and the First and Second World Wars. Thousands of unique artifacts, photographs, documents and letters have been collected so far, and in 2012 an exhibition at the Belarusian State Museum made many visible to the public.\n\nOther publications supported by Peftiev in recent years have included books and albums of the work of Belarusian artists Vladimir Zinkevich, Alexander Slucky, Viktor Alshevsky, and celebrated ballet choreographer Valentin Elizarev.\n\nIn 1999, Peftiev's companies partnered with Elizarev and the French Embassy in Belarus to produce the ballet \"La Esmeralda\" (inspired by Victor Hugo's \"Notre Dame de Paris\") at The National Academic Grand Opera and Ballet Theatre of the Republic of Belarus.\n\nFor several years, Peftiev's companies also sponsored the Yuri Bashmet International Music Festival in Minsk and the Belarusian vocal quintet Clear Voice.\n\n\n"}

He was named after his father’s English cousin, Sir William Temple. While Temple was still an infant, Temple's father died on February 26, 1785 and he was raised by his mother and older half-brothers.\n\nAt the age of 19, Temple was sent to the College of William and Mary to obtain a gentleman’s education. He spent two years at the college, graduating in 1803. Having reached the legal age of 21, Temple received a parcel of land in northern Loudoun County near Leesburg not far from Raspberry Plain, the house in which he grew up. According to Thomson Mason's last will and testament, recorded in Stafford County on September 26, 1784, he had bequeathed to Temple, his brother Westwood Thomson Mason and their half-brother, Abram Barnes Thomson Mason, several hundred acres of land along the Potomac River. On November 29, 1803, at the Loudoun County Courthouse in Leesburg, the three brothers filed a document which partitioned the land, with Temple receiving .\n\nTemple Mason built his home, Temple Hall, in the Federal style between 1810 and 1812. On June 16, 1812, Temple married Ann Eliza Carroll, daughter of Nicholas Maccubbin Carroll and Anne Jennings, in Annapolis, Maryland. Their first child, Temple Anna, was born at Temple Hall in 1813.\n\nTemple Mason not only oversaw the management of his prosperous Temple Hall farm, but also became involved in the community life of Leesburg. He served as a vestryman at St. James Episcopal Church and oversaw the polls during elections in Loudoun County. As a mark of his increased social standing in the community, Temple's estate became a hub of Leesburg society. On August 9, 1825 Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette during his grand tour of the United States and accompanied by President John Quincy Adams and former President James Monroe (who was then residing at his Oak Hill plantation in southern Loudoun County) visited Temple Hall. The three gentlemen witnessed the baptism of Mason's two youngest daughters; Lafayette became the godfather for Mary Carroll, and Adams and Monroe became as Maria Louisa's godfathers.\n\nMason served one term in the Virginia House of Delegates, from 1830-1831, temporarily displacing veteran James McIlhaney.\n\nTwo of Temple Mason's sons and one of his daughters, Templeanna (1819-1849), died before the American Civil War. The same Leesburg, Virginia graveyard contains the remains of his sons Thomas Henry Carroll Mason (1822-1838) and Westwood Thomson Mason (1819-1854), the latter of whom died in Savannah, Georgia. Charles Carroll Mason (d. 1866) and Nicholas Carroll Mason (1810 - 1874) did not serve in either army in that conflict and are also buried in that cemetery; likewise William Temple Thomson Mason, Jr. (1800-1891), who would die and be buried in Tennessee. William T.T. Mason's daughter Eliza Mason Welch (1820-1899) married in Maryland in 1836 but spent most of her adult years and died in Iowa. In the 1850 U.S. Federal census, Mason owned more than a dozen enslaved people. William T.T. Mason of Washington, D.C. owned at least four enslaved people in 1860, a 5 year old black girl, 16 year old mulatto woman and 30 and 59 year old black and mulatto males.\n\nOn January 2, 1857, six years after the death of his wife, and at the age of 75, Temple sold Temple Hall to Henry A. Ball for the sum of $50,000 and retired to Georgetown in Washington, D.C. Temple Mason died in 1862 and was interred in the Old Episcopal Churchyard in Leesburg.\n\nTemple and his wife Ann had at least eleven children:\n\nWilliam Temple Thomson Mason was a nephew of George Mason (1725–1792); son of Thomson Mason (1733–1785); half-brother of Stevens Thomson Mason (1760–1803) and John Thomson Mason (1765–1824); first cousin of George Mason V (1753–1796); first cousin once removed of Thomson Francis Mason (1785–1838), George Mason VI (1786–1834), Richard Barnes Mason (1797–1850), and James Murray Mason (1798–1871); uncle of Armistead Thomson Mason (1787–1819), John Thomson Mason (1787–1850), and John Thomson Mason, Jr. (1815–1873); and great uncle of Stevens Thomson Mason (1811–1843).\n"}
