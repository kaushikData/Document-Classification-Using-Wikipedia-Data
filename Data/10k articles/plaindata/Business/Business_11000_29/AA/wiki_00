{"id": "795050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=795050", "title": "Affluenza", "text": "Affluenza\n\nAffluenza, a portmanteau of \"affluence\" and \"influenza\", is a term used by critics of consumerism. It is thought to have been first used in 1954, but it was popularised in 1997 with a PBS documentary of the same name and the subsequent book \"\" (2001, revised in 2005, 2014). These works define affluenza as \"a painful, contagious, socially transmitted condition of overload, debt, anxiety, and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more\". The term \"affluenza\" has also been used to refer to an inability to understand the consequences of one's actions because of financial privilege, such as in the case of Ethan Couch.\n\nIn 2007, British psychologist Oliver James asserted that there was a correlation between the increasing occurrence of affluenza and the resulting increase in material inequality: the more unequal a society, the greater the unhappiness of its citizens. Referring to Vance Packard's thesis \"The Hidden Persuaders\" on the manipulative methods used by the advertising industry, James related the stimulation of artificial needs to the rise in affluenza. To highlight the spread of affluenza in societies with varied levels of inequality, James interviewed people in several cities including Sydney, Singapore, Auckland, Moscow, Shanghai, Copenhagen and New York.\n\nIn 2008 James wrote that higher rates of mental disorders were the consequence of excessive wealth-seeking in consumerist nations. In a graph created from multiple data sources, James plotted \"Prevalence of any emotional distress\" and \"Income inequality\", attempting to show that English-speaking nations have nearly twice as much emotional distress as mainland Europe and Japan: 21.6 percent vs 11.5 percent. James defined affluenza as \"placing a high value on money, possessions, appearances (physical and social) and fame\", which was the rationale behind the increasing mental illness in English-speaking societies. He explained the greater incidence of affluenza as the result of 'selfish capitalism', the market liberal political governance found in English-speaking nations as compared to the less selfish capitalism pursued in mainland Europe. James asserted that societies can remove the negative consumerist effects by pursuing real needs over perceived wants, and by defining themselves as having value independent of their material possessions.\n\nClive Hamilton and Richard Denniss's book, \"\", poses the question: \"If the economy has been doing so well, why are we not becoming happier?\" They argue that affluenza causes overconsumption, \"luxury fever\", consumer debt, overwork, waste, and harm to the environment. These pressures lead to \"psychological disorders, alienation and distress\", causing people to \"self-medicate with mood-altering drugs and excessive alcohol consumption\".\n\nThey note that a number of Australians have reacted by \"downshifting\"—they decided to \"reduce their incomes and place family, friends and contentment above money in determining their life goals\". Their critique leads them to identify the need for an \"alternative political philosophy\", and the book concludes with a \"political manifesto for wellbeing\".\n\nIn December 2013, State District Judge Jean Boyd sentenced a North Texas teenager, Ethan Couch, to 10 years' probation for driving under the influence and killing four pedestrians and injuring 11 after his attorneys successfully argued that the teen suffered from affluenza and needed rehabilitation, and not prison. The lawyers had argued that Couch was unable to understand the consequences of his actions because of his financial privilege. The defendant had been witnessed on surveillance video stealing beer from a store, driving with seven passengers in a Ford F-350 \"stolen\" from his father, and speeding at in a zone. Couch was also driving while under the influence of alcohol (with a blood alcohol content of 0.24%, three times the legal limit for an adult in Texas) and the tranquilizer Valium. At a February 5, 2014, hearing, Eric Boyles—whose wife and daughter were killed in the crash—said, \"Had he not had money to have the defense there, to also have the experts testify, and also offer to pay for the treatment, I think the results would have been different.\" In April 2016, a judge sentenced Ethan Couch to 720 days in jail after he violated his probation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36281982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36281982", "title": "Agneta Matthes", "text": "Agneta Matthes\n\nAgneta Wilhelmina Johanna van Marken-Matthes (4 October 1847 – 5 October 1909) was a Dutch entrepreneur. She and her husband Jacques van Marken were involved in the manufacture of yeast throughout their lives, and were engaged in the cooperative movement, taking care of their workers. Matthes and Van Marken created living quarters for workers in her hometown, Delft in South Holland, named Agnetapark after her. These are considered a model for the cooperative development and construction of garden cities (self-contained communities) for workers. Matthes founded and ran a Delft perfume factory, Maison Neuve, to take advantage of a by-product from the yeast factory.\n\nAgneta Wilhelmina Johanna Matthes was born on 4 October 1847 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Agneta Matthes was the daughter of Jan Willem Frederik Matthes, an insurance agent. She and her sister, Sara Elizabeth Marken-Matthes (1849–1902), grew up in upper middle-class circumstances. Matthes was taught privately, and spent 1862 to 1864 in Utrecht in a boarding school. When she returned to Amsterdam, she studied piano and dance, and took art classes and religious instruction. Matthes' sister Sara Elizabeth, who was affectionately known as Nora, married Zionist politician Arnold Kerdijk (1846–1907), the founder of the Free-thinking Democratic League, in 1876. He was a Member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands between 1877 and 1901. Sara Elizabeth and Arnold lived at the Spoorsingel in Delft and had four children. Agneta maintained a close relationship with them, Nora named her first-born daughter after her sister \"Agneta\".\n\nIn 1865, Agneta met Jacob Cornelis van Marken, known as Jacques, who studied technology and sociology at the Polytechnical School of Delft, a precursor of the Delft University of Technology. During his studies he took a study tour to Austria-Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. Later, when he heard a baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, he recalled the method which he learnt during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.\n\nOn 7 October 1869 the couple married just before the first yeast factory in the Netherlands, the \"Nederlandsche Gist & Spiritusfabriek NV\", opened. The factory is now part of the multinational chemical company Koninklijke DSM. Jacques van Marken is regarded as one of the Dutch pioneers in the development of industrial food production because of his concept of factory production.\n\nTheir marriage was registered in the Delft population register on 10 November 1869. Their first home was a modest apartment on a canal, but they moved frequently after that. As of 2012, all of their homes are still standing and all are classified as historic buildings. Their last home, to which they moved on 3 June 1885, was a villa in Agnetapark, Delft. When Matthes learnt that their marriage would be childless, she decided to dedicate her life to her husband's business and career, and participated in the establishment and management operation. She accompanied her husband to the factory every day, having her own office. She also continued to have private lessons. In addition to administrative activities, their main interests were personnel policy issues. Matthes and van Marken maintained close contact with the employees of the factory and their families, which appealed to the couple's sense of community; they wanted to be part \"of a larger whole\". Agneta Matthes shared her husband's belief in progress, and they both promoted the personal development of their employees.\n\nIn 1886, when Jacques van Marken was in France at a spa, Agneta Matthes found a letter from Maria Eringaard requesting the child support that he owed for their children, which led to Matthes discovering that her husband had begun a relationship with Eringaard in 1871 when she was aged 15, and that he had four children by her. Matthes solved the financial problems discreetly. She did not tell van Markem that she knew about the affair until 1889, when Eringaard died of tuberculosis, as had two of her children.\n\nVan Marken and Matthes took care of the three surviving children, Cornelis, Clara, both adolescents, and Anna, a young child. Officially they were foster children, but it was an open secret (officially secret but widely known) in Dutch society that van Marken was their father. With the consent of Matthes, van Marken planned to adopt them, but his religious father vetoed the adoption. Jacob Cornelis Eringaard, the eldest illegitimate son of van Marken, later headed the \"Gist & Spiritusfabriek\" and pursued the social interests of his father and his wife. The youngest daughter, Erry Anna Eringaard, was married in 1932 to the diplomat and publisher Daniel Johannes von Balluseck (1895–1976).\n\nBecause legally, married women were required to have the approval of their husbands to do business, Agneta Matthes acted \"for and on behalf\" of her husband. Also because of this, extensive records of the business ventures and career of Jacques van Marken exist, while only a few sources mention the activities of Matthes. It is unclear, therefore, to what extent Agneta was responsible for ideas. She undoubtedly had operational control of the perfume factory, \"Maison Neuve\". She undertook an empirical analysis of the housing needs of 48 working families, equipped Agnetapark significantly, and was influential at least during the early years in the management of her husband's other companies, especially in matters of personnel.\n\nMatthes and van Marken, who was called a welfare engineer by his contemporaries, developed a premium wage system for his factory workers of the \"Nederlandsche Gist & Spiritusfabriek NV\" (1869), under which all employees could receive bonuses of two to 20 percent of their salary in addition to their basic salary \"for good work and because of zeal\". The company paid up to ten percent of its profits as a dividend to its employees. In 1880, the engineer, Gerhard Knuttel, a grandnephew of van Marken, established a \"Concerns van het Personeel\" (human resources management), the first such institution in the Netherlands. Due to van Marken's health problems, François Gerard Waller, his nephew, was entrusted with the management of the factory in 1886.\n\nIn 1873, Agneta Matthes founded her own business, the Delft perfume factory, \"Maison Neuve\", where her husband acted pro forma as owner because of the legal issues. The factory used the ethanol by-product of the yeast production of \"Gist & Spiritusfabriek\".\n\nAgneta concentrated on the perfume factory in the following years, and collaborated with the Delft porcelain manufacturer De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles, which created perfume bottles for her products. She participated in international exhibitions, where her perfume brand, PMN (Parfumerie Maison Neuve), won several prizes and gained recognition for her company. She won the bronze medal of the 1878 on the Paris World's Fair. In Australia, her perfumes won first prize at the international perfume fair. She sold the company in 1886 with profit.\n\nIn 1883, the couple became interested in margarine, a young industry in the Netherlands at the time. With private capital and a legacy from Matthes' mother, they founded the \"Nederlandsche Oliefabriek NV\", and built a factory next to the yeast factory. In 1885, they took over \" Delftse Lijm & Gelatinefabriek NV\". Jacques van Marken officially acted as sole manager. To operate a purchasing cooperative in Agnetapark, they founded the Cooperative \"Winkelvereeniging\" in 1873. In 1892 they also founded a printing company, which now is owned by the \"Koninklijke Drukkerij GJ Thieme\". In all these companies, Matthes was instrumental in decision making, planning and organisation. The couple pursued the same personnel policy as in the \"Gist & Spiritusfabriek\". In 1878, they established the first works council of the Netherlands, called, \"de Kern\" (the kernel). At the height of their success in 1885, when they employed approximately 1,250 employees, their companies were collectively known as, the \"Delftsche Nijverheid\" (Delft Industry).\n\nOn 24 June 1882, the first issue of an internal newspaper of the factory, called, \"Fabrieksbode\" (\"messenger of the factory\"), was published. It was the first magazine of that kind in the world. Agneta helped her husband with other publications, such as his 1881 book, \"La question Ouvrière à la fabrique de Neerlandaise levure et d'alcool. Essai de solution pratique\" (The Labour Problem in the Dutch Yeast and Alcohol Factory. Attempt at a Practical Solution), and another in 1894, \"L'Organisation Sociale dans l'industrie\" (The Social System in the Industry), which was printed in two editions and translated into English and German. The full extent of Matthes' participation is not known, but she was certainly in charge of the translations.\n\nIn 1881 the couple began work on a housing quarter for their workers that followed the principles of the garden city movement. With financial support from Matthes' mother, they purchased a plot of land for 16,000 guilders. in Hof van Delft, then a rural, sparsely populated village well outside the Delft city limits. From 1882 to 1884, the area was developed in the style of an English landscape garden, crisscrossed by streams, after the plans of landscape architect, Louis Paul Zocher, son of Jan David Zocher. Eugene Cowl, an architect, designed 48 row houses, other buildings, and a villa for Matthes and van Marken. The facility was named \"Agnetapark\", after its founder. The residential park featured individual multi-story apartments with private entrances, private bathrooms, and private garden areas. Matthes and van Marken established a corporation for the development of the settlement, and gave the park to its workers in 1870 as a cooperative, in order to prevent speculation.\n\nTo the great astonishment of the founders, the employees were not so happy as expected. The area was remote from urban infrastructure and lacked good transportation facilities. These disadvantages were offset by an improvement of community facilities in three buildings: \" De Gemeenschap\" (the community), a large house with a kindergarten and an elementary school, which served as a gathering place and a dining room. Other features included a gymnasium, a billiards club, \"de Tent\" (the tent) – a music and event pavilion, and a grocery store, which later also sold clothes. The park had a playground, a bowling alley, a shooting range, and a boathouse with rowing boats for hire. A volunteer fire department, a brass band, and clubs for shooting, bowling, and cycling also were founded.\n\nThe employees, however, did not like living so close to their employers. They complained about the distance to the city and the transportation problems, and they criticised the rental rates and the reserves they had to make. After the deaths of Matthes and van Marken, however, the park gradually evolved into a desirable residential area. In 1931 the villa, \"Rust Roest\", which had long been empty, was converted into a school. It was demolished in 1981. Since 1989, the park has been listed as Cultural heritage.\n\nIn 1871, van Marken was appointed secretary of the \"Vereeniging van het Volksonderwijs bevordering dead\" (Association for the Advancement of Public Education), after which time Agneta Matthes regularly visited charity schools and was involved in the improvement of their situation.\n\nDuring the winter of 1879-1880, extended periods of extreme cold affected the Netherlands. Permafrost and temperatures down to minus 16 degrees Celsius led to distress among the citizens of Delft. In response, Matthes founded the \"Vereeniging voor Armenzorg\" (Association to care for the poor), helping regardless of religious or political beliefs. She prompted her husband to launch a \"Wintersnood-Commissie\", which was led by him, his brother-in-law Arnold Kerdijk, and CEO-to-be Gerard Knuttel.\n\nIn 1880, the couple founded a health insurance scheme for bakers. This insurance was also the first step toward more regulated pensions. Insurance in case of accidents at work was established in 1884.\n\nVan Marken was regarded as a \"social entrepreneur\" and a pioneer of his time regarding social issues, however, he was criticised for acting for his workers instead of letting them participate. Although she was not explicitly mentioned, Matthes also drew criticism. In 1906, the journalist Frank van der Goes published van Marken's obituary in \"Het Volk\", the organ of the Social Democratic labour movement. Two critical articles were entitled, \"Een levensleugen\" (A Delusion of a Life) and imputed ulterior motives of van Marken's undoubted social engagements. Van der Goes wrote that by providing care to his workers, van Marken had bribed their loyalty and wanted to exercise social control, while his staff was unduly dependent on him; for example, they found difficulty changing jobs once they had moved into a house in Agnetapark.\n\nDespite the disappointments regarding Agnetapark, it was an important model for the cooperative development and construction of garden cities for workers. The park is considered the first social housing scheme which cared about providing hygienic living conditions in a green environment for a high quality of life.\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\nOnline citations\n\n"}

It is located at 1 Bowling Green, near the southern tip of Manhattan, roughly on the same spot as Fort Amsterdam, the original center of the settlement of New Amsterdam, and Government House, the mansion built as an official residence for the President of the United States, but which was never occupied. The Custom House was named to commemorate Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and its first Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nThe building is now the home of the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian, as well as the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York; since 2012, it is also the home to the National Archives at New York City.\n\nThe building was designed by Minnesotan Cass Gilbert, who later designed the Woolworth Building, which is visible from the building's front steps. The selection of Gilbert to design the building was marked with controversy. Until 1893, federal office buildings were designed by government architects under the Office of the Supervising Architect of the United States Department of the Treasury. In 1893, the Tarsney Act permitted the Supervising Architect to hire private architects following a competition. The Supervising Architect James Knox Taylor picked Gilbert, who earlier had been his partner at the Gilbert & Taylor architecture firm in St. Paul, Minnesota. The controversy never quite blew over, and in 1913, the Tarsney Act was repealed.\n\nConstructed between 1902 and 1907, the building is considered to be a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style, where public transactions were conducted under a noble Roman dome. It incorporates Beaux Arts and City Beautiful movement planning principles, combining architecture, engineering, and fine arts. Lavish sculptures, paintings, and decorations by well-known artists of the time, such as Daniel Chester French, Karl Bitter, Louis St. Gaudens and Albert Jaegers, embellish the facade, the two-story entry portico, the main hall parallel to the facade, the Rotunda, and the Collector's Reception Room.\n\nSculpture was so crucial to the scheme that the figure groups had independent contracts. The major work across the front steps, \"The Continents\", also called the \"Four Continents\", of Asia, America, Europe, and Africa, was contracted to French, with associate Adolph A. Weinman. Above the main cornice are standing sculptures representing the great seafaring nations, representing American seagoing commerce as the modern heir of the Phoenicians.\n\nIn 1937, during the Great Depression, the Treasury Relief Art Project (with funds and assistance from the Works Projects Administration) commissioned a cycle of murals for the main rotunda from Reginald Marsh.\n\nThe building sits on the site of Fort Amsterdam, the fortification constructed by the Dutch West India Company to defend their operations in the Hudson Valley. The fort became the nucleus of the New Amsterdam settlement, and in turn, of New York City. From 1799 to 1815, the first Custom House at this site was the Government House.\n\nThe building is on the National Register of Historic Places, for both its exterior and public interior spaces. The Custom House was one of the earliest designations of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. In 1987, the completion of its preservation, spurred by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who saved the building from demolition in 1979, attracted much public attention. Exterior and ceremonial interior spaces were cleaned, restored, and conserved, while old office space was renovated for Federal courtrooms and ancillary offices, rental offices and meeting rooms, and for a 350-seat auditorium with state-of-the-art projection facilities. Upgrades of fire safety, security, telecommunications, and heating, air conditioning, and ventilating systems accompanied alterations. In 1990, Moynihan sponsored the law that renamed the building after Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nThe site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976.\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The surrounding neighborhood, which includes adjacent alleys and several blocks of Bush Street, is sometimes, though not universally, referred to as San Francisco's French Quarter for its historic ties to early French immigrants, and its popular contemporary French restaurants and institutions.\n\nNamed after Josiah Belden early California pioneer, San Jose's first mayor, and real estate businessman. Belden owned a portion \"of the block on the east side of Kearny Street, between Bush and Pine running through to Belden Place. He built the Harpending block on the south side of Market Street, above first and the Belden block on the southwest corner of Montgomery and Bush Streets. Later, Belden sold much of the Market Street property to Charles Crocker. The area was home to San Francisco's first French settlers. Approximately 3,000, sponsored by the French government, arrived near the end of the Gold Rush in 1851. According to historian Gladys Hansen, the French shared Dupont Street (now Grant Avenue) with early Chinese settlers during the early days of Chinatown, and were more sympathetic than others to their concerns. French novelist Alexandre Dumas, père, in his 1852 first-person account \"A Gil Blas in California\", describes local Chinese cooks experimenting with French cuisine. The enclave persisted, despite subsequent waves of Chinese, Italian, Irish, and other immigrants to the area.\n\nBelden Place itself is a one-lane, one block long street running south from Pine Street to Bush Street, parallel to and in between Montgomery and Kearny streets, immediately south of the Bank of America tower. It is roughly between Chinatown and the Financial District.\n\nIn 1990, restaurateurs Olivier Azancot and Eric Klein opened Cafe Bastille, the mainstay that set the modern tone for the area. The French, Italian, and Catalan establishments are popular with locals, tourists, and office workers, and are generally considered on par with the city's best casual full-service European restaurants. Notable restaurants in the alley itself include Sam's Grill, Cafe Bastille, Cafe Tiramisu, Plouf, B44, Belden Taverna, and Brindisi Cucina di Mare. Nearby are Café de la Presse (though modest and unassuming, a favorite hangout of the city's political and social elite) and Le Central. Also nearby are the Alliance Française, the French consulate, and the Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church (where mass is still celebrated in French) and an affiliated elementary school. In the vicinity are several other restaurants, cafes, hotels and other French-related institutions along Bush Street and Claude Lane, another nearby alley.\n\nThe cafes, hotels and restaurants of the area have a distinct joie de vivre befitting the neighborhood's heritage. Due to cold weather and lack of available locations, no other neighborhood in San Francisco has a comparable street dining scene. The lane is closed to vehicular traffic and filled for lunch and dinner with portable chairs, tables, umbrellas, and outdoor heaters. At night the lively street is lit with candles, Christmas lights strung overhead, and light spilling out from the restaurant interiors. Restaurants send attractive hostesses out into the street to lure potential diners. Every year, the area is the site of a boisterous Bastille Day celebration, the nation's largest, and Bush Street is temporarily renamed \"Buisson\".\n\n"}

A number of senior vice presidents, vice presidents, directors, and other senior marketing managers responsible for various parts of the marketing strategy may report directly to the CMO.\n\nThe day-to-day tasks are often categorically different from one another, due to the fluid nature of the CMO's skill set: language is needed to stitch together all aspects of the company. Thus, in a given day the CMO completes tasks that fall into many different categories:\n\n\nThe CMO must quickly react to changing circumstances in the firm, and must shape the company's understanding of a particular product, sales strategy, or marketing idea. Each of these products comes from a different department, so the CMO must be a nexus of information: it is a highly receptive role, with involvement in departments such as production, information technology, corporate communications, documentation, public relations, law, human resources, and finance.\n\nIn the 21st century, digitalization and the rise of consumer-centric marketing has changed the role of the CMO. They are now typically finding themselves handling customer-facing technology implementations in addition to the above tasks. Gartner analyst Laura McLellan predicted that in the future CMOs will spend more on IT than their counterpart CIOs. According to analyst firm McKinsey, few senior-executive positions will be subject to as much change over the next few years as that of the chief marketing officer. \n\nPeers to the CMO include Chief human resources officer, Chief technology officer, Chief financial officer, Chief communications officer, Chief procurement officer, Chief information officer, and general counsel.\n\nThe CMO is responsible for facilitating growth, sales and marketing strategy. They must work towards objectives such as revenue generation, cost reduction, or risk mitigation. The unpredictable effect of marketing efforts, coupled with the need to drive profits, often leads to a short tenure for most CMOs. \"Forbes\" reported that the average CMO tenure in 2008 was just over 28 months.\n\nAccording to a 2011 IBM global study of CMOs around the world, CMOs see customer loyalty as their top priority in the digital era; their second priority is to design experiences for tablets and mobile apps.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26498317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26498317", "title": "Crossing sweeper", "text": "Crossing sweeper\n\nA crossing sweeper was a person who would sweep a path ahead of people crossing dirty urban streets in exchange for a gratuity. This practice was an informal occupation among the urban poor, primarily during the 19th century. It was the focus of fairly intense study and commentary, and attitudes toward the presence of crossing sweepers on city streets varied greatly among urban residents, ranging from appreciation for their work to feelings that they were a public nuisance. Crossing sweepers also found their way into 19th-century fiction and artwork, including a novel by Charles Dickens and a popular painting by William Powell Frith.\n\nCrossing sweepers were a common sight on the streets of large cities during much of the 19th century. The predominance of horse-drawn vehicles—and the general uncleanliness of urban streets—entailed certain difficulties in crossing intersections. For example, the long dresses of many elite women might easily be soiled by horse droppings (among other forms of refuse). Crossing sweepers, by sweeping the pavement ahead of a person crossing the street and creating a path that was referred to as a \"broom walk,\" thus offered a service, particularly to the more affluent.\n\nIn his multi-volume work \"London Labour and the London Poor\" (published 1851), English journalist Henry Mayhew \nreferred to mid-19th-century crossing-sweeping as \"one of those occupations which are resorted to as an excuse for begging...\" Crossing sweeping was likely a \"last chance\" source of income for many and had the advantage of requiring little or no startup capital. Those who worked as sweepers were able to ask for money from passersby without necessarily being viewed solely as beggars, and sweepers who regularly worked the same area likely were viewed more sympathetically by those who lived in the neighborhood, leading at times to more formal \"weekly allowances.\" Crossing sweepers may have earned a more substantial income in the early 19th century, prior to the arrival of the omnibus, but by the mid-19th century the returns were generally small, with as little as a shilling being considered a \"good day's earnings\" even for the relatively privileged sweepers on London's main thoroughfares.\n\nAmong those who worked as crossing sweepers were the elderly and the disabled or, as one 19th-century observer put it, \"cripples, and old men and women, shrivelled like dry wrinkled apples, who are just strong enough to give the public that real convenience...\"\n\nChildren also worked as crossing sweepers, and the occupation was regularly portrayed in the art and literature of the day as the work of an impoverished child, usually a boy. Children sweepers would sometimes work individually and at other times in groups. In the latter situation there was often a designated leader—sometimes styled as \"king\"—and the money was generally shared. Groups of young crossing sweepers could be territorial and would fight others to maintain control of their \"turf\" if necessary. In mid-19th-century New York City, crossing-sweeping was common among young girls, who had even fewer options for earning an income than did lower-class boys (with occasional prostitution being a notable exception).\n\nSome observers chronicled the \"types\" of crossing sweepers at great length. A piece in \"Chambers's Edinburgh Journal\" in 1852 discussed seven categories of sweepers found on the streets of London—Professional Sweeper; Morning Sweeper; Occasional Sweeper; Lucus-a-non; Sunday Sweeper; deformed, maimed, and crippled sweepers; and Female Sweepers—who plied their trade with varying degrees of skill, effort, and financial success. Henry Mayhew differentiated between \"casual\" and \"regular\" crossing sweepers, with the former only working certain days of the week and/or varying the location at which they worked while the latter swept at one particular corner almost every day. In \"London Labour and the London Poor\" Mayhew discussed \"Able-bodied\" (divided into \"male,\" \"female,\" and \"Irish\"), \"Afflicted or crippled,\" and \"Juvenile\" crossing sweepers, offering in-depth observations from and about actual sweepers with whom he spoke.\n\nCity residents had mixed reactions to crossing sweepers and their presence on urban streets. Richard Rowe viewed crossing-sweeping as \"little better than a make-believe of work, as a pretext for begging, either directly or by suggestion.\" Rowe did not see a problem with \"alms-giving\" to elderly or disabled crossing sweepers, but overall wanted to see their ranks \"thinned considerably - viz., by the elimination of the adults who are able, and the young who might be trained to do something better...\" A writer in an 1858 issue of \"Building News\" expressed a similarly negative sentiment when referring to \"those juvenile highwayman who, broom in hand, take possessions of our crossings and level black mail upon the public in general, and timid females in particular.\"\n\nOthers viewed crossing sweepers as legitimate workers who provided a useful service and thus differentiated themselves from more nefarious persons encountered in the streets. An 1864 comment in \"The Art Journal\" noted that crossing sweepers \"are of a different class from the pickpocket and vagrant classes who prowl about to make what prizes fall within their reach.\" In 1882 a self-described \"Lady Pedestrian\" wrote the editors of \"The New York Times\" lamenting recent prohibitions on street sweepers:\n\nA few years ago there were many children and men who turned out immediately after a snow-fall, and were daily to be met during the thaw, brushing the crossings as clean as they could. For this small service many foot passengers gladly gave a few small coins, regarding the sweepers not as beggars or vagrants, but as laborers, whose hard and disagreeable work enabled well-shod people to pass neatly on their way. There has, however, been a prohibition of street sweepers...The result is that on Wednesday last...there was not one crossing on which the snow and mud did not come full two inches above the sole of a thick gaiter, and it was entirely impossible to find a single crossing to the opposite side of the avenue which could be trod without sinking to the ankle...let us have the volunteer sweepers back for the comfort of a LADY PEDESTRIAN.\n\nSome older crossing sweepers suffered abuse from their fellow citizens, at times from children. Rowe described one London man, called \"Parson,\" who was regularly \"tormented\" by youths of the street. However \"the police and the omnibus-men, the newsvendors and the miscellaneous loungers hanging about the inn in front of which Parson's crossing, or rather crossings, stretched, did their best to protect the old fellow, and soundly cuffed his persecutors when they chanced to run their way...\"\n\nIn his detailed account of the lives and work of crossing sweepers, Henry Mayhew concluded that, \"taken as a class, \ncrossing-sweepers are among the most honest of the London poor. They all tell you that, without a good character and 'the respect of the neighborhood,' there is not a living to be got out of the broom.\"\n\nThe occupation of crossing sweeper received perhaps its most famous literary treatment in Charles Dickens' novel \"Bleak House\" with the character of Jo, a homeless boy who \"fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the horses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum...\" Jo has been characterized as \"one of the most significant figures\" in the novel and as a way for Dickens to address juvenile vagrancy, which was seen as a serious social problem at the time.\n\nDickens described Jo as:\n\nnot a genuine foreign-grown savage; he is the ordinary home-made article. Dirty, ugly, disagreeable to all the senses, in body a common creature of the common streets, only in soul a heathen. Homely filth begrimes him, homely parasites devour him, homely sores are in him, homely rags are on him; native ignorance, the growth of English soil and climate, sinks his immortal nature lower than the beasts that perish.\n\nOne scholar characterized Jo as being \"depicted as almost completely bereft of agency, a child swept along by circumstances, made merely to 'move on,'\" a member of \"a nation that fails to recognize him as one of its citizens.\" Jo was a popular character among readers of the novel which no doubt in part led to the production of a stage adaptation entitled \"Bleak House; or Poor 'Jo. A drama in four acts\".\n\nA real fourteen-year-old youth named George Ruby who was called to testify at the Guildhall in 1850 is often thought to have been Dickens' inspiration for Jo (who, in the novel, was called to testify before an inquest). While not disagreeing with that assessment, Edwin M. Eigner and Joseph I. Fradin have argued that an earlier, literary precedent comes from Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1846 novel \"Lucretia\", which also featured a young male crossing sweeper, this one named Beck. Eigner and Fradin suggest that both Jo and Beck are intensely symbolic figures for the two novelists, \"the representative orphan of an entire society.\"\n\nCrossing sweepers were also regularly portrayed in the visual arts, and Mark Bills argues that \"from the late eighteenth century, prints of crossing sweepers invariably had a satirical purpose.\" Robert Sayer, William Marshall Craig, and Thomas Rowlandson all created prints of crossing sweepers in the late 18th century or early 19th century. In the 1850s \"Punch\" magazine frequently printed satirical images of crossing sweepers, depicting \"each one [as] a nuisance of modern life.\" An 1856 article in the magazine entitled \"The Crossing Sweeper Nuisance\" offered nineteen humorous descriptions of different sweepers, including (invented) tales of woe designed to elicit sympathy, for example \"a Crimean soldier, who was flogged and dismissed the army for protecting a female from the insults of his commanding officer.\"\n\nA more sympathetic portrayal was William Powell Frith's 1856 painting \"The Crossing Sweeper\" (pictured at the top of this article), the popularity of which was evinced by a market for painted and engraved replicas of the image. Frith was a friend of Dickens and had painted versions of his characters before, though his model for \"The Crossing Sweeper\" was a real boy. According to Frith's autobiography, the crossing sweeper who modelled for his painting attempted to steal Frith's gold pocket watch when the artist went out for lunch.\n\nBeginning in 1876 the British actress, Jennie Lee, made a career out of playing Jo, the crossing-sweeper, in the popular play \"Jo\", a melodrama John Pringle Burnett based on \"Bleak House\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26805835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26805835", "title": "Dinu Nicodin", "text": "Dinu Nicodin\n\nDinu Nicodin (; pen name of Nicolae Ioanid; 1886–1948) was a Romanian writer affiliated with the modernist venue \"Sburătorul\". Having an aristocratic (boyar) background, he was an eccentric and adventurous figure who only turned to literature as a hobby, and whose scattered works were generally well received by critics during his lifetime. Nicodin was a promoter of works by his younger colleagues, and cultivated close friendships with those of his generation, being primarily noted for his presence on the interwar's social scene.\n\nNicodin's two novels, \"Lupii\" (\"The Wolves\") and \"Revoluţia\" (\"The Revolution\"), have earned praise for their erudition and their characteristic narrative style, but these traits have also made him hard to place in relation to 20th century currents in Romanian literature. The writer largely faded out of critical memory by 1950, although there has been a significant resurgence in interest in later decades.\n\nThe scion of an old and prosperous boyar family, Nicodin lived in Bucharest, where his main residence was the Capşa Hotel. He was reportedly a passionate hunter, sharing this hobby with the other surviving members of Romanian boyardom. His other activities centered on eccentric and adventurous pursuits: a dueler and a horse rider, he was also a financial expert, and once tasked by the government with overseeing the liquidation of a bank. Although discovered late in life, his literary ambition is said to have led him to consider writing not just novels, but also screenplays and studies, in several languages.\n\nCultivating a personal relationship with literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu, Nicodin became a presence among the members of Lovinescu's literary circle, \"Sburătorul\". The two shared a book collecting hobby and a love of fine paper: Nicodin procured for his friend paper items made from Japanese silk, and financed bibliophile editions of both their works. While attending the sessions of \"Sburătorul\", Nicodin also pursued a romantic affair with female novelist Cella Serghi. His own debut came late in life: the 1934 novel \"Lupii\", which elevated him to critical attention, and the prose poem \"Aghan\".\n\nDinu Nicodin made his comeback to literature during World War II, when he published a volume of short stories, \"Pravoslavnica ocrotire\" (approx., \"The Orthodox Protection\"). Seeing print two years later, \"Revoluţia\" was Nicodin's contribution to the historical novel genre. His literary confirmation came later, after the August 1944 Coup toppled the repressive Ion Antonescu regime (\"see Romania during World War II\"). In September, Nicodin was one of the writers newly admitted into the Romanian Writers' Society, and whose arrival followed the expulsion of authors considered fascists or supporters of authoritarianism.\n\nShortly before his 1948 death, Nicodin was in correspondence with young critic Ion Negoiţescu. A disciple of Lovinescu and member of the Sibiu Literary Circle, Negoiţescu had earlier given an enthusiastic review to \"Revoluţia\". Nicodin was among those who tried to obtain Negoiţescu a scholarship to study in France, but their common project ultimately failed.\n\nDinu Nicodin had an eccentric position in the field of Romanian literature, and has traditionally been described by literary critics and historians as a hard to classify figure, and found primarily interesting for using a distinctive stylistic category of the Romanian language. One such reviewer, George Călinescu, welcomed the novelist's 1934 debut as a display of \"best quality humor, solid culture and an irony of rare acrimony.\" The same commentator later defined Nicodin as \"bizarre\" and \"snobbish beyond all belief\".\n\nLater voices in criticism expanded on such verdicts, while issuing various interpretations of Nicodin's contextual role. Nicolae Manolescu notes that common perception has linked together Nicodin and another eccentric figure of his generation, Mateiu Caragiale, but suggests that this comparison is \"entirely senseless\", the only such similarity being a \"precious and sumptuous style\" present in both \"Lupii\" and works by Caragiale. Ovid Crohmălniceanu primarily identified Nicodin's literary contribution by its \"arty prose\", which he believed akin to the styles of Caragiale and Emanoil Bucuţa. He notes that, in Nicodin's case, the marks of this approach include: \"carefully staged phrasing\", \"archaic patina\", \"affected and snobbish\" manner and \"rare pictorial strength\".\n\n\"Lupii\", a combination of travel literature and satire, made an instant impression on the reading public. The narrative pretext is a hunting trip into the northern reaches of Transylvania region and into Maramureş, during which the protagonist, a forestry clerk named Venetici (from \"venetic\", \"stranger\") is confronted with differences in customs and the hostility of locals. In his 1934 review of the novel, Călinescu suggested that the theme of the book partly deals with a cultural tension between, on one hand, the \"asperities\" of character encouraged by the Habsburg legacy in Transylvania and, on the other, the social characteristics introduced after the \"Great Union\". Crohmălniceanu finds that a defining element of \"Lupii\" is the inhospitality of local characters, which offers Nicodin grounds for \"ironic reflections with erudite references\".\n\nIn his definitive history of Romanian literature (first published in 1941), Călinescu nuanced his positive appraisal of \"Lupii\". His note on the subject deemed \"puzzling\" other critics' reactions to Nicodin's work, including comparisons made between the author and the 19th century Romantic prose writer Alexandru Odobescu. In effect, he argued, \"Lupii\" was \"an amateur's modest party, soon after forgotten.\"\n\nThe author's interest in bookish themes is again evidenced in \"Aghan\", where he adapts a Romantic theme from French author Gérard de Nerval's \"La Main enchantée\" (\"The Enchanted Hand\"). A more ambitious project, \"Revoluţia\" was Dinu Nicodin's perspective on French Revolution and the philosophy of history. Writing from a Marxist perspective, Crohmălniceanu argued that the novelist was constructing \"precipitous ramblings\", the signs of \"reactionary delirium\". He nevertheless approved of \"memorable scenes\" such as the \"Noyades\": \"a somber painting, accomplished with extraordinary power of expression.\"\n\nThe volume was received with sympathy by some of the authors who were just then debuting. One of them, Pericle Martinescu, called it \"a European-level creation\" and Nicodin's \"capital work\", but argued that the particularities of style made it untranslatable. According to a 2008 article by academic Andrei Terian, Ion Negoiţescu's early review of Nicodin's book erred by shifting critical attention toward \"saucy and picturesque\" aspects, such as a glimpse into Jean Jacques Rousseau's sexuality. Negoiţescu also found \"admirable\" the pages which discuss the Great Fear, and expressed further praise for Nicodin's approach to the Reign of Terror (centered on graphic episodes such as one in which dogs drenched in human blood are chasing each other through the streets).\n\nPresent in Lovinescu's various autobiographical texts, Dinu Nicodin is also briefly mentioned in the memoirs of female novelist Lucia Demetrius, whose debut was also under the auspices of Lovinescu's circle. Demetrius, who describes the aged author as a \"very elegant\" man, also reports that Nicodin gave a good reception to her unpublished work, but also notes feeling \"stunned\" that Lovinescu, who mediated between his two associates, callously intervened in their correspondence. Nicodin is referred to in the autobiographical notations of another novelist, I. Peltz. He described his colleague as \"well-built, with the calm gaze of men who have seen and are aware of many things\", and recalled: \"he dressed himself in accordance with the latest fashion in London, wore the most expensive perfumes of Paris, spoke with a studied foreign accent [and] carried out his correspondence on extra fine paper\".\n\nDinu Nicodin was often ignored altogether in works of literary history published both before and after the establishment of Romania's communist regime. Among the works of his day who did mention Nicodin's work, George Călinescu's 1941 synthesis, according to a later pronouncement by literary critic Cosmin Ciotloş, effectively \"dismissed [it], with superiority, in just a couple of phrases.\" An exception to this rule is Nicodin's younger friend, Negoiţescu: his own overview study of Romanian literature, published after his self-exile to West Germany, allocates more text to Nicodin's work than to the better-known works of Liviu Rebreanu.\n\nThe partial recovery of Nicodin's work which followed the 1989 Revolution and end of communism included a 2000 reprint of \"Revoluţia\", published by Editura Albatros and edited by critic Ion Simuţ. In 2008, Nicodin was granted a sizable entry in Nicolae Manolescu's own overview of Romanian literature. According to Ciotloş, Manolescu parted with his mentor, George Călinescu, by reinstating Nicodin to a more prominent position. Manolescu's text was itself a comment on Nicodin's legacy: \"Without doubt, the man is [...] superior to his work. Without the man's reputation, it is probable that the novels, not to mention the short stories [...], would now be forgotten.\"\n"}
{"id": "7255285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7255285", "title": "E. St. Elmo Lewis", "text": "E. St. Elmo Lewis\n\nElias St. Elmo Lewis (March 23, 1872 – March 18, 1948) was an American advertising advocate—he wrote and spoke prolifically about the potential of advertising to educate the public. He was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame posthumously, in 1951.\n\nLewis was born in Philadelphia as son of Enos Rees and Mary Bartram Lewis. He descended on maternal side from John Bannister Gibson and John Bartram, on paternal side from the same family as Meriwether Lewis. His middle name, St. Elmo, was derived from the eponymous novel by Augusta Jane Evans published in 1866. Lewis was educated at North Broad Street Select School in Philadelphia, later renamed into \"Eastburn Academy\" after its founder, then at the University of Pennsylvania where he edited the \"University Courier\" in 1893 and 1894. In 1895, he was the editor of an arts publication called \"Moods\", and business manager of \"Footlights, A Clean Paper for the Theatre Goer\" while also acting as a junior partner and business manager for a printing company.\n\nLewis founded an advertising agency in 1896 called \"The Advertisers' Agency\" which was located in the old Penn Mutual Building in Philadelphia. Its business slogan - \"Ask Lewis about it\" - gained proverbial fame. He took charge of the diphtheria antitoxin advertising of the H. K. Mulford Company in 1896. \"The Advertisers' Agency\" established branch offices during the first half of 1897, first in Buffalo, then in Detroit. The Buffalo office was headed by Frank Fellows, formerly employed by \"The Charles H. Fuller Company.\" Charles J. Shearer, former advertising manager to \"Strawbridge & Clothier\" in Philadelphia, became President of \"The Advertisers' Agency\" in July 1897, while Lewis retained his old position as General Manager. In July 1901, Lewis was selected by the Peirce School in Philadelphia to conduct the Peirce School of Advertising. In that year, \"The Advertisers' Agency\" was succeeded by \"E. St. Elmo Lewis, Incorporated\" with a capital stock of $50,000. Lewis resigned from his company in November 1902 and sold all his stock holdings a year later. \"E. St. Elmo Lewis, Inc.\" was eventually dissolved in 1906.\n\nLewis worked at the National Cash Register Company from 1902 to 1903, then as advertising manager to the Burroughs Adding Machine Company from 1905 to 1914. In September 1903, he joined the staff of \"The Book-Keeper\" as assistant general manager and as general managing editor of the journal. In June 1910, Lewis was elected president of the newly founded National Association of Advertising Managers at their first regular meeting at Hotel Pontchartrain in Detroit. He had conceived the idea of forming a select organization of advertisers as early as Summer 1908 and wrote a letter to Alfred Darlow, advertising manager of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, to ask for his cooperation. In September 1914, he became vice-president and general manager of the \"Art Metal Construction Company\" in Jamestown (NY). Lewis joined the Campbell Ewald Co. as advertising and sales counsel in December 1915. He was associated with that company until 1926.\n\nAfterwards, Lewis worked for \"National Services, Inc.\" in Detroit as counsellor in consumer and trade relations, and, as of 1931, as vice-president and editorial director of the \"Keystone Publishing Company\" in Philadelphia. In 1932, Lewis joined a newly formed organization called \"Advisory Management Corporation\" in Philadelphia as chief of staff of the marketing division. In early 1937, he was asked by the \"Evansville Co-Operative League\", an organization of large industrial firms in Evansville (IN), to outline a community program and platform.\n\nLewis was married to Maude Rose Wherry. In the early 1940s, the couple moved from Detroit to St. Petersburg, Pinellas County (FL), \"on doctors' orders\", as the \"Highway Traveler\" noted in 1946, \"to take care of an overworked heart.\" He died there on March 18, 1948.\n\nSince 1925 when \"The Psychology of Selling and Advertising\" by Edward K. Strong, Jr. was published, it became commonplace to attribute the authorship of the AIDA model to Lewis. According to Strong, Lewis formulated the slogan \"attract attention, maintain interest, create desire\" in 1898, adding later the fourth term \"get action\".\n\nThe following table summarizes Lewis' evolving idea concerning the principal functions of advertising:\n\nThe earliest, rudimentary discussion of advertising principles appeared in a column which Lewis wrote for \"The Inland Printer\" under the pen name \"Musgrove\". In the August 1897 issue he stated:\n\nA quote in the December 1897 issue of \"Fame - A Journal for Advertisers\" provides further evidence that Lewis reflected about advertising principles even prior to 1898:\n\nTwo elements from the 1898 slogan were already present, \"attract attention\" and \"maintain interest\" (=sustained attention, see below).\n\nIn his book \"Financial Advertising\" Lewis gave the subject the most detailed treatment. Its appearance was scheduled for Fall 1907, but was postponed when a financial crisis, the so-called Panic of 1907, hit the United States. From the initially planned 600 pages the book grew to almost 1000 pages. The original components from the 4-part slogan \"attract attention, maintain interest, create desire, get action\" were scattered around the pertinent chapters on advertising principles. In addition, Lewis used language variants in order to express the same idea, e.g. \"create demand\" for \"create desire\", or \"hold interest\" for \"maintain interest\". It is therefore convenient to differentiate between the 4-part advertising \"slogan\", which was initially targeted toward an educational audience, and the 3-part advertising \"model\" in which variable features are assigned to its components.\n\n\"The three elements in any successful advertisement must occur to any man who will analyze the advertisements that have appealed most strongly to him,\" wrote Lewis at the beginning of his discussion of advertising principles. The first requirement is to attract attention. \"If we cannot gain the reader’s attention it is manifestly impossible for us to interest or convince him.\" From this principle Lewis derived two hypotheses, namely that the reader is “attracted in proportion to the strength of the personal appeal to him” and, secondly, \"favorable attention is conducive to close attention.\" In accordance with William James’ definition of interest as sustained attention, Lewis postulated furthermore that an attention attractor should \"hold the mind long enough to let it [the attention] merge into interest, without the conscious effort of the reader.\" This constitutes the second component of the model, awaken the interest. As a third requirement, the advertisement \"must convince the reader of the reasonableness and correctness of its claims and arguments – it must make him consciously assent to its logic and conclusions.\" To that principle Lewis assigned the step \"get action\" from the original slogan. As the advertisement produces conscious assent, it arouses to action. A classic strategy to \"get action at once\" is to furnish the advertisement with a coupon which the reader is required to fill out. \"The coupon is to advertising what the ready order-blank and fountain pen are to the salesman.\" \n\nLater, as a result of changing market conditions in the early 20th century, Lewis placed special emphasis on the third stage of his advertising slogan in an article titled \"Make 'm Buy Cars\":\n\nThe influence of Harvard professor William James on Lewis was profound. The idea of mental states merging into each other can be traced back to James' concept of the \"stream of consciousness\" in general and his distinction between \"substantive\" and \"transitive states of mind\" in particular. Having introduced this idea into advertising theory marks Lewis' lasting contribution, regardless of which elements were added later to the model or in which order the elements were arranged. Apart from this, James' influence extends to Lewis' terminological usage as well (e.g. \"mental machinery\" and others).\n\nIn retrospect, Lewis wrote about his career in the advertising business:\n\nA rather neglected source in the history of organizational behavior is Lewis' book \"Getting the most out of business.\" It ran through six editions in the first four years after its appearance in 1915 and was translated into French in 1923. Based on a series of twelve articles written for \"The Caxton\" under the title \"The New Gospel of Efficiency,\" he reformulated in this work the ideas of the Efficiency Movement in a systematic manner. Lewis contrasted the schools of scientific management by Frederick Winslow Taylor and Harrington Emerson and called for the \"development of the whole man for the whole business\":\n\nIn 1911, Lewis gave a speech before the American Bankers Association, titled \"The Savings Idea and the People,\" advocating that savings bankers adopt a policy of \"aggressive conservation,\" wherein they recognize that in order to make savings a national trait, they must acknowledge that \"they are here as an economic necessity, representing the principle of the conservation of human effort, and that in order to conserve they have a duty for which they must fight, educate, plead and teach the people...\"\n\nThe March 1905 issue of \"Ad sense\" narrates the story of how Lewis' life was once threatened by an unknown \"would-be-murderer\":\n\nAs a young advertising agent, Lewis took charge of several advertising columns in pharmaceutical and printing journals:\n\n\nBooks\n\nJournal Articles\n\nReferences\n\nNo monograph has been written up to date on E. St. Elmo Lewis. The article \"Lewis - Builder of Business\" by J. W. T. Knox, who was a close friend to Lewis, contains important biographical details.\n\n\n\nLewis' papers are archived at Michigan Historical Center:\n"}
{"id": "209411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=209411", "title": "Embezzlement", "text": "Embezzlement\n\nEmbezzlement is the act of withholding assets for the purpose of conversion (theft) of such assets, by one or more persons to whom the assets were entrusted, either to be held or to be used for specific purposes. Embezzlement is a type of financial fraud. For example, a lawyer might embezzle funds from the trust accounts of their clients; a financial advisor might embezzle the funds of investors; and a husband or a wife might embezzle funds from a bank account jointly held with the spouse.\n\nEmbezzlement usually is a premeditated crime, performed methodically, with precautions that conceal the criminal conversion of the property, which occurs without the knowledge or consent of the affected person. Often it involves the trusted individual embezzling only a small proportion of the total of the funds or resources they receive or control, in an attempt to minimize the risk of the detection of the misallocation of the funds or resources. When successful, embezzlements may continue for many years without detection. The victims often realize that the funds, savings, assets, or other resources, are missing and that they have been duped by the embezzler, only when a relatively large proportion of the funds are needed at one time; or the funds are called upon for another use; or when a major institutional reorganization (the closing or moving of a plant or business office, or a merger/acquisition of a firm) requires the complete and independent accounting of all real and liquid assets, prior to or concurrent with the reorganization.\n\nIn the United States, embezzlement is a statutory offence that, depending on the circumstances, may be a crime under state law, federal law, or both; therefore, the definition of the crime of embezzlement varies according to the given statute. Typically, the criminal elements of embezzlement are: (i) the fraudulent (ii) conversion (iii) of the property (iv) of another person (v) by the person who has lawful possession of the property.\n\nEmbezzlement differs from larceny in three ways. First, in embezzlement, an actual \"conversion\" must occur; second, the original taking must not be trespassory, and three, in penalties. To say that the taking was not trespassory is to say that the person(s) performing the embezzlement had the right to possess, use, and/or access the assets in question, and that such person(s) subsequently secreted and converted the assets for an unintended and/or unsanctioned use. \"Conversion\" requires that the secretion interfere with the property, rather than just relocate it. As in larceny, the measure is not the gain to the embezzler, but the loss to the asset stakeholders. An example of \"conversion\" is when a person logs checks in a check register or transaction log as being used for one specific purpose and then explicitly uses the funds from the checking account for another and completely different purpose.\n\nIt is important to make clear that embezzlement is not always a form of theft or an act of stealing, since those definitions specifically deal with taking something that does not belong to the perpetrator(s). Instead, embezzlement is, more generically, an act of deceitfully secreting assets by one or more persons that have been \"entrusted\" with such assets. The person(s) entrusted with such assets may or may not have an ownership stake in such assets.\n\nIn the case where it is a form of theft, distinguishing between embezzlement and larceny can be tricky. Making the distinction is particularly difficult when dealing with misappropriations of property by employees. To prove embezzlement, the state must show that the employee had possession of the goods \"by virtue of his or her employment\"; that is, that the employee had formally delegated authority to exercise substantial control over the goods. Typically, in determining whether the employee had sufficient control the courts will look at factors such as the job title, job description and the particular operational practices of the firm or organization. For example, the manager of a shoe department at a department store would likely have sufficient control over the store's inventory (as head of the shoe department) of shoes; that if they converted the goods to their own use they would be guilty of embezzlement. On the other hand, if the same employee were to steal cosmetics from the cosmetics department of the store, the crime would not be embezzlement but larceny. For a case that exemplifies the difficulty of distinguishing larceny and embezzlement see State v. Weaver, 359 N.C. 246; 607 S.E.2d 599 (2005).\n\nNorth Carolina appellate courts have compounded this confusion by misinterpreting a statute based on an act passed by parliament in 1528. The North Carolina courts interpreted this statute as creating an offence called \"larceny by employee\"; an offence that was separate and distinct from common law larceny. However, as Perkins notes, the purpose of the statute was not to create a new offence but was merely to confirm that the acts described in the statute met the elements of common law larceny.\n\nThe statute served the purpose of the then North Carolina colony as an indentured servant– and slave-based political economy. It ensured that an indentured servant (or anyone bound to service of labour to a master, e.g., a slave), would owe to their master their labour; and, if they left their indentured service or bound labour unlawfully, the labour they produced, either for themselves (i.e., self-employed), or for anyone else, would be the converted goods that they unlawfully took, from the rightful owner, their master.\n\nCrucially (and this can be seen as the purpose of the statute), any subsequent employer of such an indentured servant or slave, who was in fact bound to service of labour to a pre-existing master, would be chargeable with misprision-of-a-felony (if it was proved in they knew that the employee was still indentured to a master, or owned as a slave); and chargeable as an accessory-after-the-fact, in the felony, with the servant or slave; in helping them, by employing them, in the unlawfully taking that which was lawfully bound (through the master servant relationship) in exclusive right, to the master of the indentured servant or slave.\n\nEmbezzlement sometimes involves falsification of records in order to conceal the activity. Embezzlers commonly secrete relatively small amounts repeatedly, in a systematic and/or methodical manner, over a long period of time, although some embezzlers secrete one large sum at once. Some very successful embezzlement schemes have continued for many years before being detected due to the skill of the embezzler in concealing the nature of the transactions or their skill in gaining the trust and confidence of investors or clients, who are then reluctant to \"test\" the embezzler's trustworthiness by forcing a withdrawal of funds.\n\nEmbezzling should not be confused with skimming, which is under-reporting income and pocketing the difference. For example, in 2005, several managers of the service provider Aramark were found to be under-reporting profits from a string of vending machine locations in the eastern United States. While the amount stolen from each machine was relatively small, the total amount taken from many machines over a length of time was very large. A smart technique employed by many small-time embezzlers can be covered by falsifying the records. (Example, by removing a small amount of money and falsifying the record the register would be technically correct, while the manager would remove the profit and leave the float in, this method would effectively make the register short for the next user and throw the blame onto them)\n\nAnother method is to create a false vendor account and supply false bills to the company being embezzled so that the checks that are cut appear completely legitimate. Yet another method is to create phantom employees, who are then paid with payroll checks.\n\nThe latter two methods should be uncovered by routine audits, but often aren't if the audit is not sufficiently in-depth, because the paperwork appears to be in order. A publicly traded company must change auditors and audit companies every five years. The first method is easier to detect if all transactions are by cheque or other instrument, but if many transactions are in cash, it is much more difficult to identify. Employers have developed a number of strategies to deal with this problem. In fact, cash registers were invented just for this reason.\n\nSome of the most complex (and potentially most lucrative) forms of embezzlement involve Ponzi-like financial schemes where high returns to early investors are paid out of funds received from later investors duped into believing they are themselves receiving entry into a high-return investment scheme. The Madoff investment scandal is an example of this kind of high-level embezzlement scheme, where it is alleged that $65 billion was siphoned off from gullible investors and financial institutions.\n\nInternal controls such as separation of duties are common defences against embezzlement. For example, at a movie theatre (cinema), the task of accepting money and admitting customers into the theatre is typically broken up into two jobs. One employee sells the ticket, and another employee takes the ticket and lets the customer into the theatre. Because a ticket cannot be printed without entering the sale into the computer (or, in earlier times, without using up a serial-numbered printed ticket), and the customer cannot enter the theatre without a ticket, both of these employees would have to collude in order for embezzlement to go undetected. This significantly reduces the chance of theft, because of the added difficulty in arranging such a conspiracy and the likely need to split the proceeds between the two employees, which reduces the payoff for each.\n\nAnother obvious method to deter embezzlement is to regularly and unexpectedly move funds from one advisor or entrusted person to another when the funds are supposed to be available for withdrawal or use, to ensure that the \"full amount\" of the funds is available and no fraction of the savings has been embezzled by the person to whom the funds or savings have been entrusted.\n\nOffences of embezzlement were formerly created by sections 18 and 19 of the Larceny Act 1916.\n\nThe former offences of embezzlement are replaced by the new offence of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.\n"}

EASME was founded in 2003 as the Intelligent Energy Executive Agency (IEEA) and was renamed the European Agency for Competitiveness and Innovation (EACI) in 2007, finally becoming EASME in 2014. It is responsible for managing specific programmes in the fields of energy, the environment, and business support. Its goal is to promote sustainable development while improving the competitiveness of European industries. \nWhile the Agency has its own legal identity, it reports to several Directorates-General of the European Commission, which remain responsible for programming and evaluation of the programmes.\n\nThe Agency was created in 2003 to implement the Intelligent Energy – Europe (IEE) programme, which seeks to foster market conditions for the development of new energy technology and is overseen by the European Commission's Energy Directorate-General. IEEA was the first Executive Agency to be established.\n\nIn 2007, its mandate was extended to include the Commission's 2007-2013 Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme 2007-2013 (CIP) and the Marco Polo Programme 2007-2013. It was also renamed EACI. In practice, this meant that the bulk of the Agency's work was split into three programmes from other DGs. It continued working on IEE. The agency then also became involved in the operations of the Eco-Innovation programme, which is overseen by DG Energy and provides assistance to pre-market environmental products. It also handled parts of the Marco Polo programme, which works to shift road haulage to rail and water transport, and was managed by DG Mobility and Transport.\n\nIn 2014, the agency changed its name to EASME, and it became responsible for other programmes in addition to IEE and Eco-Innovation. It currently handles the operations of parts of Horizon 2020, the EU Research and Innovation programme. EASME is also responsible for the majority of COSME, the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises. It also operates part of LIFE, a financial instrument to support conservation and environmental actions in the EU. Finally, EASME will be involved in the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, which finances the EU's maritime and fishing policies.\n\nEASME is a temporary agency, initially established for a period beginning on 1 January 2004 and ending on 31 December 2008. This period has been extended to 2024.\n\nEASME works with the Energy Directorate-General to organise an annual event, the EU Sustainable Energy Week (EUSEW), which aims to bolster the development of renewables and greater energy efficiency through knowledge-sharing and the showcase of new ideas. EUSEW was first launched in 2006.\n\nThe Agency also helps give visibility to separate events through its Energy Days. These are organised by independent actors, and promoted by EASME.\n\n"}

Brownell, Director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale.\n\nThe book looks at the causes of the obesity epidemic in America and why the crisis is spreading overseas. The book claims to reveal both the roots of the problem and what might be done, exploring the convergence of human nature, public indifference, and capitalistic spirit that has transformed the American waistline and jeopardized the nation’s health.\n\nThe authors critique the current culture of America, one that fosters a \"toxic food environment\" and promotes poor eating habits. The book also proposes public policy solutions for reversing the obesity trend and enabling individuals, families, and communities to adopt healthier diets.\n\nThe book analyzes the two passionately divided sides of the current debate, or “food fight.” One side argues that obesity, like smoking, is a public health crisis that demands governmental involvement in order to achieve a solution. Advocates of this viewpoint suggest that government use its legislative power to subsidize production of healthier foods, to regulate food industry practices, and to minimize the extent of junk food advertising to children. Brownell and Horgen support this side of the debate throughout their book.\n\nThe other side argues that weight is a matter of personal responsibility, and food choice should not be regulated by government in any capacity. Proponents of this viewpoint support prohibiting lawsuits against food companies and restaurants for their culpability in the obesity epidemic. Advocates of this viewpoint include lobbyists for the food industry.\n\n"}

The brand of watches carries the slogan \"Master of Complications\". Franck Muller's watches are worn by various celebrities, among them Demi Moore, Elton John, 50 Cent, Lil Uzi Vert, and José Mourinho. Franck Muller timepieces are famous for their fusion of \"modern\" style, mostly inspired by American watches from the thirties, like \"Elgin tonneau\", and traditional Swiss watch manufacturing.\n\nFranck Muller was born in 1958. He spent his childhood in La Chaux-de-Fonds with his Italian mother and Swiss-born father. When 15, he enrolled in a watchmaking school.\nIn the early 1980s, he graduated from the Watchmaking School of Geneva (). Afterwards, he began repairing top-quality pocket watches. Close to an independent watchmaker by the name of Svend Andersen, Franck Muller became responsible for handling watches from the collection of Patek Philippe. \nMost of the clientele were private individuals and museums. While he was working with complicated timepieces, he became passionate about their mechanisms and began to think of building his own workshop.\n\nSoon after, in 1984, Franck Muller designed his own tourbillon wristwatch. In the 1980s, few watchmakers were capable of creating such complicated timepieces, among them Patek Philippe and Vacheron Constantin. The private clients of Franck Muller continued to come for new timepieces, and thus his business started growing. \nThe House of Franck Muller opened in 1991, and his ultra complicated timepieces instantly became famous in Europe and the United States. Today, his factory, which is also the headquarters of Franck Muller, produces a limited number of watches for private clientele. Franck Muller's collections include a variety of designs and price ranges.\nNow the company has five sites (Genthod, Lajoux, Les Bois, Plan-les-Ouates, Meyrin) and 570 official retailers.\n\nThe company's estimated total sales (in 2010/2011) were €290 million in watches with an average unit price of €38,000.\n\nFranck Muller is also known for its \"World Premiers\". Each year, the manufacturer launches at least one new line of timepieces, featuring something special and exclusive, that has never been seen before in the watchmaking industry. The first such world premiere was launched in 1993. The watches had a split seconds chronograph, a minute repeater, and a perpetual calendar. In addition, the watches included an indicator showing the internal temperature.\n\nNotable timepieces include \"Revolution2\", \"Revolution3\", \"Crazy Hours\", and \"Colour Dreams\". Further examples of Franck Muller's watches include the Endurance, which is a simple chronograph, the \"Master Banker\", which is a tonneau-shaped watch capable of multiple time zone indication, and the \"Curvex Minute Repeater Tourbillon\", whose production is limited to 25 pieces.\n\n\n"}

Ury. Subsequent editions in 1991 and 2011 added Bruce Patton as co-author. All of the authors were members of the Harvard Negotiation Project. The book made appearances for years on the \"Business Week\" bestseller list. The book suggests a method called principled negotiation or \"negotiation of merits\".\n\nMembers of the Harvard Negotiation Project, Fisher and Ury focused on the psychology of negotiation in their method, \"principled negotiation\", finding acceptable solutions by determining which needs are fixed and which are flexible for negotiators. By 1987, the book had been adopted in several U.S. school districts to help students understand \"non-adversarial bargaining\". In 1991, the book was issued in a second edition with Bruce Patton, an editor of the first edition, listed as a co-author. The book became a perennial best-seller. By July 1998, it had been appearing for more than three years on the \"Business Week\" \"Best-Seller\" book list. As of December 2007, it was still making appearances on the list as one of the \"Longest Running Best Sellers\" in paperback business books. The third edition was published in 2011.\n\nThe method of principled negotiation was developed at the Harvard Program on Negotiation by Fisher, Ury, and Patton. Its purpose is to reach agreement without jeopardizing business relations. The method is based on five propositions:\n\nThe first principle of \"Getting to Yes\"—\"Separate the people from the problem\"—applies to the interaction between the two parties to a negotiation. The principle is broken down into three subcategories: perception, emotion, and communication. The authors point out that negotiators are people first—people who have values, cultural backgrounds, and emotions that vary by person. \"Getting to Yes\" teaches that this human aspect can be either helpful or disastrous. Negotiation can either build trust and understanding with a positive relationship established at the end, or lead to frustration or dissatisfaction. The authors discuss how the relationship between parties tends to become entangled with the problem that the parties are discussing.\n\nIncorrectly deducing the intentions of the other party based on one's own fear is a common mistake; the authors describe it as a bad habit that could cost \"fresh ideas in the direction of agreement\". The authors explain that feelings are just as important as the content of the dispute during negotiation. Communication is the main aspect of negotiating, and the authors point out three common problems in communication:\n\nSimilarly, in the book, \"I Win You Win\", Carl Lyons explored the principle of \"separating the person from the problem\" and discovered that interests are an extension of values. People's current interests are always attempting to satisfy something that they value. Understanding this principle is a key first step in understanding people's behavior in negotiations.\n\nThe second principle—\"Focus on interests, not positions\"—is about the position that the parties hold and the interests that led them to that position. The authors recommend that negotiators should focus on the interests behind the position that each party holds. Both parties should discuss their interests and keep an open mind to the other side of the argument. It is crucial to put yourself in the shoes of the other side to try to understand \"why\" the other side is acting the way they are or rather \"why they are not\". The authors state that \"the most powerful interests are basic human needs\".\n\nThe third principle—\"Invent options for mutual gain\"—is about benefiting both parties that are doing business. This principle aims to help the parties find an option that will impact each party in a positive way, making both sides feel like they did not get taken advantage of during the negotiation. It is important to listen to the other party and not make a decision until both parties feel that they have been heard. Both parties should clearly explain their intentions and what they want out of the conversation.\n\nThe fourth principle—\"Insist on using objective criteria\"—is about making sure that the conversation stays on topic and that it is productive. The parties are making deals based on objective and practical criteria. The three steps to using objective criteria are to find out what the other party's intentions are, keep an open mind, and never give in to pressure or threats. Each party is in charge of keeping the other party committed to the conversation.\n\nThe fifth principle—\"Know your BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement)\"—emphasizes that no method can guarantee success if all the leverage lies on the other side. The authors suggest two methods of going about negotiating from a position of power. First, each party should protect themselves first. Second, each party should make the most of the power within their own assets to negotiate and win against the opposite party.\n\nWhen negotiating, the parties must resist the urge to constantly compromise for fear of completely losing the negotiation. Such compromises may allow for a shorter negotiation, but may also leave the primary party with a deal that didn't benefit them to the full extent. Establishing a \"bottom line\" can protect the negotiator's final offer, but may limit the ability to learn from the negotiation itself and may preclude further negotiation that possibly could result in a better advantage for all parties involved. When considering final decisions, each party may want to take a step back and consider all possible alternatives to the current offer being made. One example in the book describes a house on the market: Thinking of all other possibilities if the house were not sold should be compared with the option of selling the house to ensure the best decision is made.\n\nThe article \"Taking steps toward 'Getting to Yes' at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida\" highlights principled negotiation in practice by a major insurance company. Blue Cross and Blue Shield—aware of increasing competition, rising healthcare prices, and increased customer expectations—sought to highlight other parties' interests when creating policies so as not to drive away business. The authors noted that applying principled negotiation techniques came much more naturally at the executive level and needed more practice at lower levels of management.\n\nJames J. White, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, suggested that \"Getting to Yes\" is not scholarly or analytical and relies on anecdotal evidence, and that \"the authors seem to deny the existence of a significant part of the negotiation process, and to oversimplify or explain away many of the most troublesome problems inherent in the art and practice of negotiation\". There is no quantitative evidence presented that suggests outcomes using this technique will typically be better than an alternative method, such as positional bargaining.\n\n\"Getting Past No\" is a reference book on collaborative negotiation in difficult situations, written by William L. Ury. First published in September 1991 and revised in 2007, this book is the sequel to \"Getting to Yes\".\n\n\n"}

The company was acquired by Oracle Corporation, and Oracle still supports the application today under the umbrella of Oracle Communications. The software is used by many telecom companies (not just telephone, but ISPs, cable companies, and more).\n\nWhen MetaSolv was originally developed in the early 1990s, the new application was first referred to as ASAP (\"Access Services and Provisioning\"). ASAP provided a method for tracking equipment inventory, port consumption and circuit designs for engineering departments within telecom companies. But, by 1997, the need for tracking customer service orders was identified, and the system enhanced to provide for it. Along with order tracking, the need for workflow management was also addressed.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the application was rebranded by the company as TBS (\"Telecom Business Solution\") from version 3.10 through version 4.11, until the introduction of the 5.0 version. At that time (\"about 2003\"), MetaSolv Inc again rebranded the application, this time to MetaSolv Solution, also known as M/5. The latest release is often simply referred to simply as M6.\n\nMetaSolv Inc had several other products besides M6, and made efforts to provide seamless integration and connectivity between MetaSolv and those products in various ways. After Oracle acquired MetaSolv Inc (see below), Oracle absorbed all of MetaSolv Inc's products and continued the trend of integrating them. Even without those integrations, MetaSolv is a stand-alone OSS application that supports service provisioning through the entire life-cycle of customer and network development.\n\nMetaSolv Software Inc. (\"Nasdaq: MSLV\") was privately founded in 1992 soon becoming a leading provider of service fulfillment solutions designed to meet the needs of telecommunications providers. MetaSolv Inc became a publicly traded company offering an IPO in 1999. MetaSolv (\"the company\") was acquired by Oracle in 2006 for $219 million. On December 15, 2006, a majority of MetaSolv stockholders approved Oracle's acquisition of MetaSolv Software Inc.. Oracle continues to offer and maintain the application today.\n\nMetaSolv Solution (\"the software\") is an Oracle Database application sometimes described as \"Telco in a Box\". The system provides for many business processes common among all types of telecommunications businesses including:\n\n\nTypical implementation of MetaSolv within any telecom company often include users from Customer Care, Service Ordering, Engineering, Switching, Central Office and Field Technician departments.\n\nEarly in the development of the application, MetaSolv Inc realized the need to implement common industry standard practices such as those provided today by iConectiv (\"previously known as Telcordia Technologies, but rebranded after Ericsson acquired them\"). These standards included such things as standard equipment identifiers, circuit identification, location identification (\"commonly called CLLI code\"), connection codes (\"also known as Network Channel codes\"), rate codes, and much more. Across the industry, such standards are typically provided by iConectiv in the form of Common Language Information Services. By adding these standards to MetaSolv, the application more properly fit into the telecom OSS industry.\n\nLater however, companies expressed an interest in varying from industry standards. Releases after version 6.0 (6.1, 6.2, etc) included the ability to do so in some areas.\n\nToday, MetaSolv is often interfaced with other telecom company OSS/BSS systems through APIs and other means. Since the software is a front-end database application with an Oracle database behind it, multiple off-the-shelf SQL-based reporting tools are used to support business intelligence needs in several departments.\n\n\n"}

He was convicted of fraud and false accounting related to his business activities, for which he served a two-year prison term. He is also known for his association and involvement with two high-profile tech failures: the game console manufacturer Gizmondo in 2006 and IT Factory in 2008. After his release from prison, Ljungman became active in the Christian Democrats legal policy network. He was selected as the Christian Democrats parliamentary candidate for the 2014 Swedish elections.\n\nMikael Ljungman has a Masters of Laws (LL.M.) from Stockholm University. He also studied political science.\n\nLjungman's company 3P PreForm Marketing and Research began performing research and development work for Gizmondo Europe in 2003 and was paid $7.6 million. After Gizmondo Europe's bankruptcy in early 2006, the liquidators had outstanding questions about Ljungman and his company's involvement with Gizmondo Europe Ltd; they were perfectly satisfied with Ljungman's answers.\nIn May 2008, Carl Freer bought Gizmondo Europe's intellectual property rights. Ljungman worked with Freer on the relaunch of the Gizmondo, with Freer calling him his \"co-pilot\". He traveled to China in early 2008 to arrange manufacturing, a contract purported to be worth $300M. The relaunch of Gizmondo never materialized.\n\nLjungman was arrested on October 19, 2004, but released shortly thereafter pending trial. Ljungman was found guilty of false accounting and tax evasion on January 26, 2009. Ljungman initially received a two-year prison sentence; which was reduced to 10 months on appeal after the tax evasion charges were dismissed. The sentence included disqualification from running a company in Sweden for five years, which was reduced to three years starting from 2007 after the successful appeal. Ljungman's appeal went to the supreme court where it was denied and he was imprisoned in late April 2009.\n\nIn December 2008 Danish company IT Factory went bankrupt revealing systematic financial fraud. Ljungman was linked to IT Factory's CEO Stein Bagger, who went missing four days before the company's collapse was publicly announced. Bagger fled from Dubai to the United States and eventually surrendered to police in Los Angeles, where he was found to have Ljungman's car and to have used his credit card.\n\nOn January 9, 2009, the Deputy Attorney in charge of fraud cases in Denmark announced that they wanted to question Ljungman. Danish police sent out an arrest warrant for Ljungman via Interpol. He was arrested by Swedish police in Norrköping where he had just started his ten-month sentence in an open prison and was extradited to Denmark on 27 July 2009.\n\nDanish media claimed that the Swedish police had found a fake leasing contract linking IT Factory with Xiop, a Swedish company where Ljungman had worked as Business Developer. This specific claim was denied by the Swedish prosecutor Yngve Rydberg. Yngve Rydberg also said at the time there was no suspicion of Ljungman being involved in the crimes being investigated in Sweden. On the first day of his trial Stein Bagger named Ljungman as his accomplice.\n\nOn 26 March 2010, Ljungman was convicted of involvement in the IT Factory fraud in Denmark, and was released under supervision in September 2013 after serving slightly less than half of a seven-year sentence.\n\nLjungman denied involvement in Stein Bagger's fraud and appealed his sentence, however as of the time of his supervised release, no successful appeal had been completed. Ljungman claimed he was interested in IT Factory's software \"PaaS\", that he and Media Power tried to buy when IT Factory was liquidated. The software was instead sold to a German company.\n\nIn December 2012, Danish authorities recovered a portion of the money stolen from IT Factory from accounts in Hong Kong and Jersey belonging to Mikael Ljungman.\n\nShortly after he had served his prison term he was selected as parliamentary candidate for the Christian Democrats in the 2014 Swedish elections as well as their representative in the municipal elections and county council elections.\n\n"}

It was my first one.\" Because the music performed in the hall was likely to be from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Pei was unwilling to impose modern styles of architecture on the interior.\n\nThe trustees and acoustic team had decided on the shoebox style before Pei was hired, and he sought to sculpt the exteriors with more innovative designs. \"I felt the need to be free,\" he said. \"Therefore, to wrap another form around the shoebox, I started to use curvilinear forms... It does have some spatial excitement in that space for that reason.\"\n\nThe Meyerson Symphony Center also is home to the 4,535 pipe C.B. Fisk Opus 100 organ, known as the Lay Family Concert Organ. Although it had been Charles Fisk's dream to build a monumental concert organ (the firm unsuccessfully bid on the contract for San Francisco's Davies Hall), and despite years of planning and design, he never lived to see it built, dying in 1983. The resulting instrument, built in 1991 and nearly unanimously hailed as a musical triumph, whilst it built on some of his ideas, was quite different from his original designs. The première performance was given in September 1992 by the organist Michael Murray and David Higgs.\n\nThe Eugene McDermott Concert Hall was designed by Artec Consultants (also responsible for the Pikes Peak Center's El Pomar Great Hall). Artec’s Nicholas Edwards built upon ideas of Russell Johnson, the firm’s founder, combining them with his own research and those of the German group in Göttingen. Systematically working through each area of the hall on each level, he generated sketches that indicated the best placement for walls in order to optimize the all-important lateral reflections. As his ideas crystallized, he began calling the evolving room shape the ‘reverse fan.’ This was the eventual shape of both the Dallas concert hall and its younger sibling, Symphony Hall in Birmingham, England. Both these halls have strong ‘shoebox’ shaping, with the ‘reverse fan’ at the back of the room. 74 thick concrete chamber doors around the top of the hall weighing 2.5 tons each can be opened and closed to increase or reduce reverberance, 56 acoustical curtains help diminish sound vibrations and a system of canopies weighing more than 42 tons is suspended above the stage and can be raised, lowered, or tilted to reflect the sound throughout the audience chamber. The shoebox design was intended to achieve acoustics performance comparable to that of the Vienna Musikverein and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw.\nRussell Johnson, who died in August 2007, requested in his will that he be buried in the Meyerson, but logistical complications prevented the request from being granted.\n\nThe Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center has:\n\n\n\n"}

Apart from pricing markets, they also engage in any activity regarding the trading aspects of gambling, such as monitoring customer accounts and the profitability of their operations.\n\nThe odds are derived from a variety of factors through analysis of information. Certain markets are highly statistical, whereas other markets require more intuition and insight. An odds compiler may be required to monitor the financial position the bookmaker is in and adjust their position (and odds) accordingly. They may also be consulted as to whether to accept a bet or not, usually in the case where a very large bet is being placed, so as to not incur dangerously-high liabilities. Odds are usually not set completely independent from other bookmakers but are influenced by what others are quoting. This is particularly important when the overround is below 100% and hence arbitrage betting, where betters can make a profit regardless of the outcome, is possible (see mathematics of bookmaking). In this case, the bookmaker with the most aberrant odds would usually alter their odds closer to other bookmakers' prices. The odds are influenced by betting volume so that a selection receiving a high volume of liquidity may have the odds for it cut.\n\nIn 2006, there were news reports that the only female odds compiler in the United Kingdom was a woman called Helen Jacob of Sky Bet.\n"}
{"id": "28192791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28192791", "title": "Pegeen Vail Guggenheim", "text": "Pegeen Vail Guggenheim\n\nPegeen Vail Guggenheim (August 18, 1925 – March 1, 1967) was a Swiss-born American painter. Her painting combines two different artistic styles: surrealism and naïve art.\n\nShe was the daughter of the art collector Peggy Guggenheim and the writer Laurence Vail, and the granddaughter of Benjamin Guggenheim, who died on the RMS Titanic in 1912.\n\nPegeen Vail Guggenheim was born in Ouchy, Switzerland and spent her childhood in France and England. In 1941, she left Europe for the United States with her mother, Peggy Guggenheim and Max Ernst, who would later become her stepfather. While in the United States, she studied at the prestigious Finch College.\n\nIn 1943, she met the French painter, Jean Hélion, who, along with his friends Piet Mondrian and Fernand Léger, helped introduce abstract art in the United States. Guggenheim married Hélion in New York in 1946. The couple moved to Paris the same year. They had three children together: Fabrice, David, and Nicolas Hélion. When they divorced in 1956, Pegeen left Paris with her youngest son, Nicolas, to live with her mother in Venice.\n\nIn 1957, Guggenheim met the English painter Ralph Rumney in London at the opening of a Francis Bacon exhibition at the Hanover Gallery. Rumney was an English New Realist and one of the founders, along with Guy Debord and Piero Simondo, of the Situationist International. Guggenheim married Rumney in 1958 and gave birth to her fourth son, Sandro Rumney, the same year. In 1959, the couple moved to Paris, where they lived first on the rue du Dragon and then on the Île Saint-Louis.\n\nGuggenheim died in Paris on March 1, 1967, after overdosing on medication. She struggled all her life with depression.\n\nDuring her short career, Guggenheim exhibited her work in New York (including the Museum of Modern Art), Philadelphia, Paris, London, Venice, Padua, Murano, Palm Beach, Vicenza, Stockholm, Toronto and San Diego.\n\nGuggenheim befriended, and was inspired by, some of the greatest intellectuals and artists of the 20th century, including Yves Tanguy, Max Ernst, André Breton, Marcel Duchamp, and Jackson Pollock. Her painting combines two different artistic styles: surrealism and naïve art. She was especially inspired in her work by the Surrealist painters that surrounded her during her childhood, including Tanguy, with whom she exchanged some paintings, and Ernst, who was her stepfather for five years, from 1941 to 1946. Her work reflects their influence in the recurrence of improbable elements or situations in her decors or scenes, combined with her own, unique naïve style.\n\nIn January 1943 and in June 1945, Guggenheim's work was featured in exhibitions dedicated to women: \"Exhibition by 31 Women\", and then \"The Women\", at the Art of This Century gallery opened by Peggy Guggenheim in New York in October 1942. Her paintings were shown alongside works by Kay Sage, Leonora Carrington, Lee Krasner, Dorothea Tanning, and Frida Kahlo.In her painting, Guggenheim often represents couples and families that seem happy and affectionate. Given her tumultuous childhood with her mother, this theme likely represents her search for a stable family life. The characters in Guggenheim's paintings are often taken directly from her own world: we can identify her mother, her husbands, her children, and especially Guggenheim herself. While her work seems cheerful at first glance, a sense of isolation and suffering is often perceptible: a woman crying while giving birth, for example, or characters that are dehumanized.\n\nRaymond Queneau wrote the following introduction to one of her exhibition catalogues:\n\"The world Pegeen creates is somehow more authentic than the real world because it seems closer to heaven on earth. No culpability tarnishes its colors or weighs upon its figures. After his expulsion, Adam with his pure heart traced perfect representations of vengeful bison on hidden cave walls. What was Eve doing? Probably listening to cries that she was guilty. But here, as Prévert says: ‘God has been expelled from heaven on earth’ and it is ‘the new season’. ‘A fertile ground- a childlike moon- a hospitable sea- a smiling sun- at the edge of the water- girls embodying the spirit of the times.’ Pegeen Hélion belongs to this race of ‘ambrosial children’.\n\n"}

Siah U-chin, Seah Uchin or Seah You Chin; 18051883) was an immigrant from South China to Singapore, later becoming a successful merchant and leader in the Overseas Chinese community.\n\nHe is a prominent descendant of Seah Clan in Southeast Asia.\n\nSeah Eu Chin was born in 1805 as the son of Seah Keng Liat (), a minor provincial official of \"Guek-po\" (i.e. in Teochew dialect) \"Village\" at the Chenghai County of the former \"Chaozhou Fu\". He was educated in Chinese classics in his youth, but decided to seek his fortune abroad. He came to Singapore in 1823, first working as a clerk, then becoming a plantation owner and finally becoming a trader and a merchant.\n\nSeah Eu Chin was a successful plantation owner. He was the first to plant gambier (or white cutch) on a large scale in Singapore. By 1839, his gambier plantation had stretched for eight to ten miles, from the upper end of River Valley Road to Bukit Timah Road and Thomson Road. Mr Seah's holdings earned him the title: 'King of Gambier'. He made his fortune in gambier and pepper plantations. However, by the 1850s–60s, the planting of gambier and pepper was becoming less profitable in Singapore for several reasons, including the increasing scarcity of uncleared land for planting (gambier quickly exhausted the soil and so plantations had to keep shifting), the shortage of firewood from the clearing of forests, and the lack of land on Singapore Island itself.\n\nTherefore, in his later years, he became involved in trading as a merchant and agent under the name of Eu Chin Co. which was based in North Bridge Road. His sons, especially the eldest, Seah Cheo Seah, and second son Seah Liang Seah, helped manage the business, as did his brother-in-law, Tan Seng Poh.\n\nIn 1837, he married a daughter of Tan Ah Hun, the Kapitan (Captain) China (i.e. leader of the Chinese community) of Perak. She died soon after from the effects of smallpox, and about a year later, he married her sister with whom he had several children. His brother-in-law, Tan Seng Poh, came with his sister to Singapore to be educated there. Seng Poh was an opium and spirit farmer (i.e. he ran a government-tendered monopoly processing raw opium imported from British India. The Opium and Spirit Farm, or Excise, was the main source of income for the Straits Settlements) and helped manage Eu Chin's mercantile firm after the latter's retirement in 1864. Most prominent among his children were Seah Liang Seah and Seah Peck Seah, both of whom also became Justices of the Peace and prominent members of the Chinese community; the former was also an unofficial member of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements. His eldest son, Seah Cheo Seah, was also a J.P. but he died only two years after his father, in 1885. He had another son, Seah Song Seah, who died in China, and three daughters, about whom very little is known.\n\nIn 1830, he and representatives of twelve Teochew clans set up the Ngee Ann Kun which later became the Ngee Ann Kongsi in 1845. He was the chairman of the Kongsi until his death whereupon power passed to his sons Seah Cheo Seah and Seah Liang Seah, followed by his grandson Seah Eng Tong, resulting in a Seah monopoly on power in the Kongsi until 1928. Resentment against them caused the formation of another Teochew clan association, the Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan.\n\nSeah Eu Chin helped run Tan Tock Seng Hospital when it was first set up, being a member, and in some years treasurer, of its management committee.\n\nJust as the European merchant community used Chinese middlemen in conducting their business, the Straits Settlements government relied on prominent Chinese businessmen to act as go-betweens with the Chinese community. Seah Eu Chin was the go-between with the Teochew community, which originated from the Chaozhou province of Southern China. He rendered service in helping to quell several disturbances in the community, most notably the 1854 Hokkien-Teochew Riots which broke out on 5 May 1854. The incident ostensibly began because of a dispute over the price of rice, between a Hokkien and a Teochew, but that dispute probably was only a trigger for the release of long-held resentment and animosity between the Hokkien (from Fujian province in China) and Teochew (from Chaozhou province) communities. In all over 400 people were killed over 10 days of violence. The British authorities on Singapore island met with Chinese leaders, including Seah Eu Chin representing Teochews and Tan Kim Ching representing the Hokkiens, and with their assistance helped to bring the situation to a close.\n\nHe was an early member of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, established in 1837, and was made a Justice of the Peace in 1867. He had also been a member of the Grand Jury since 1851, and also had cases involving Chinese referred to him by the court. In 1872, he was made an honorary police magistrate, along with four other Chinese including his brother-in-law Tan Seng Poh.\n\nSeah Eu Chin finally retired from business in 1864, to concentrate on scholarly pursuits, though he still had an interest in community affairs. For instance, his name is with that of several other Chinese on a petition submitted to the government requesting the suppression of illegal \"Wah-Weh\" gambling among the Chinese community. In the last decade of his life he lived in a mansion built by his son Seah Cheo Seah that was among the Four Mansions () of the 19th-century Chinese in Singapore.\n\nHe died on 23 September 1883, and his widow in 1905. He was buried in the family estate near the SLF Building along Thomson Road. His tomb was re-discovered in late 2012.\n\nSeveral streets in Singapore are named for Seah Eu Chin and his sons, namely Eu Chin Street, Liang Seah Street, and Peck Seah Street. Seah Street, in Bras Basah, is named for the Seah family.\n"}

Olayan\n\nSulaiman Saleh Olayan () (November 5, 1918–July 4, 2002) was among Saudi Arabia's wealthiest businessmen.\n\nOrphaned at the age of six, Olayan had more humble beginnings than most of his business counterparts from the Kingdom. Olayan's rise to great wealth reflected his acumen, an ability to cross cultural barriers, as well as extraordinary timing.\n\nInitially working for ARAMCO from 1937 to 1947, he left to start his own trucking company, the first of over 50 companies he would create or own. Over a 55-year career as an independent businessman, he served as entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist. Under his guidance and leadership, the Olayan Group became both a leading diversified enterprise in Saudi Arabia and a major participant in global investing.\n\nThe story of his entrepreneurial journey begins in the town of Unayzah in north central Saudi Arabia. For centuries, the town had been a haven for caravans venturing across the Najd, Saudi Arabia's heartland. The merchant families of Unayzah had developed important trading links with the world outside central Arabia - the cities on the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast, which had ties to Africa and Asia.\n\nIn 1918, Suliman Olayan was born into one of these merchant families. His father, Saleh, had recently returned from Medina, where he had been a spice trader. Suliman spent the first years of his life in his family's ancestral hometown.\n\nSuliman's mother died just a few months after he was born, and his father died when he was still a child. When he was about 10 years old, Suliman traveled with his older brother by camel to the Persian Gulf coast and then by boat to Bahrain. In Bahrain, at the dawn of the age of oil in that part of the Persian Gulf, Suliman attended the American school, where he learned English, and then the Al-Khalifa and Al-Jafariya schools. He proved to be an exceptional student with a prodigious memory and an uncanny ability to see things not just as they were but as they could be.\nAfter leaving school in 1936, he went to work for The Bahrain Petroleum Company. A year later, he returned to Saudi Arabia to take a job with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, the forerunner of the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco). By 1947, Suliman had risen from transportation dispatcher to storehouse supervisor to a position in Government Relations. During King Abdul Aziz Al Saud's historic visit to Dhahran in April of that year, Suliman served as a company translator.\n\nIn the wake of World War II, the oil industry was expanding rapidly. Sensing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Suliman set out on his own in the summer of 1947. With a personal loan secured on his home, he established General Contracting Company (GCC).\n\nGCC's first customer was Bechtel, which was under contract to Aramco to manage the construction of the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line (Tapline), a mammoth project designed to link the oil wells in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province to a terminal in Lebanon on the Mediterranean Sea. GCC handled transportation and related services for the historic project.\n\nBuoyed by GCC's success and with his entrepreneurial instincts and drive now in high gear, Suliman undertook a series of trailblazing projects in the 1950s. He played a key role in developing Saudi Arabia's earliest electrical power companies, founding the country's first public utility, the National Gas Company.\n\nIn 1954, he launched General Trading Company (GTC), the Group's food and consumer products distribution business. Also in 1954, Suliman was instrumental in introducing commercial insurance to Saudi Arabia, founding Arab Commercial Enterprises (ACE), which went on to become the largest insurance and reinsurance broker in the Middle East.\n\nIn the 1960s, Suliman turned to international equity investing, an activity which would eventually establish the Group as an influential participant in global capital markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Suliman was also developing business alliances, pioneering in Saudi Arabia the concept of strategic partnerships and strengthening his relationship to Bechtel. Moreover, through GTC and GCC he acquired exclusive distributorships for Kimberly-Clark, General Foods, Pillsbury, Hunt Wesson, Cummins Engine, Kenworth and Atlas Copco. In 1969, the Group obtained a license from Kimberly-Clark to construct the first paper tissue converting plant in Saudi Arabia. The same year, GTC established one of the first cold storage and meat processing plants in the Kingdom, and the Group played a leading role with other Saudi and foreign investors to establish a large factory for manufacturing plastic pipe and fittings. Other joint manufacturing ventures with major multinationals followed.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, the Group embarked on a series of new activities in Saudi Arabia, focusing on light manufacturing and franchising, reaching beyond the Kingdom to other Persian Gulf countries and the greater Middle East. At the same time, it consolidated and strengthened existing operations, a process that continues to this day.\n\nHe is survived by his son Khaled Olayan, his three daughters, Hayat Olayan, Hutham Olayan, Lubna Olayan, and his wife Mary.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5489099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5489099", "title": "Sylvia Park", "text": "Sylvia Park\n\nSylvia Park is a large business park and shopping centre in the Auckland suburb of Mount Wellington in New Zealand. Less commonly known, the area around the centre (which includes some residential and other commercial developments) is also called Sylvia Park (the centre takes its name from the area, not vice versa, but Sylvia Park is not officially a suburb). The area is located adjacent to two major interchanges of the Auckland Southern Motorway – the South Eastern Highway (which passes directly above the shopping centre on a viaduct) and Mount Wellington Highway.\n\nLand and store space in the Sylvia Park development is let out to a wide variety of major retailers, one cinema complex and two supermarkets. In addition, the centre has franchises of all major New Zealand banks and a wide variety of other retailers. The centre employs approximately 2,500 staff of which only four are security guards and was drawing about 12,000 shoppers at a time during the weekends of the 2007 winter months.\n\nIn a rating of New Zealand shopping centres by a retail expert group in 2008, Sylvia Park received four stars, the maximum rating, based on the criteria of amount of shopping area, economic performance, amenity and appeal as well as future growth prospects. Especially praised were the wide catchment of shoppers and the motorway accessibility.\n\nThe name Sylvia Park is from the large country house/stud farm built there in the late 19th century. It was the country residence of Sir Maurice O'Rorke, one of the first Speakers of the House. Sir Maurice used the land primarily for horse breeding. The house was demolished in the 1960s. From 1943 until 1992, Sylvia Park was the site of an extensive Army supply stores complex built by the American Forces during WWII. After the war these buildings were used by the NZ Defense Forces and a mix of industrial users. The buildings, which gradually became empty, were demolished for the shopping mall. Carbine Road is named after the racehorse Carbine who was foaled at Sylvia Park Stud.\n\nThe development is owned by Sylvia Park Business Centre Ltd (SPBCL), a subsidiary of Kiwi Property Group. The development is situated on 24 hectares of land, a large part of which is still to be developed as of the late 2000s. Kiwi Property acquired the land in two transactions in 1995.\n\nHowever, the land was at that stage zoned for industrial use by the Auckland City Council. The developers asked the council to modify the District Plan to allow high-density commercial use, a change which the council supported, and drafted into \"Plan Change 4\". However, the plan change was opposed by the Ngati Maru Iwi authority, which represents Māori interests in the area. A December 2001 decision of the Environment Court of New Zealand confirmed the plan change. Demolition and construction began in 2004, with retail construction beginning in 2005.\n\nStage One of the development opened to the public on 6 June 2006. The opening received nationwide television and radio coverage the day before, as the development is one of the largest in New Zealand. This resulted in a very high shopper turnout on the opening day, and despite planning by SPBCL, caused severe gridlock on the notoriously busy Auckland Southern Motorway as well as major arterial routes in the vicinity of the centre, including the South-Eastern and Mount Wellington Highways. Transit New Zealand and SPBCL took the unusual step of recommending people postpone trips to the mall. As part of the conditions of being granted planning permission SPBCL was required to manage traffic flows to the site, and had the traffic jams continued would have faced an accelerated timetable for upgrading key roads. The congestion did force SPBCL to implement a traffic monitoring programme ahead of schedule. Stage Two of the development opened in August 2006 and expanded the fashion, beauty and food retailers of the centre.\n\nIn contrast to the initial interest, weekday retail sales were soon considered to be flagging, with the centre being nicknamed 'Spooky Park' by some. The owners noted that this did not extend to weekend sales, and that the centre had in the meantime gained during the weekdays as well.\n\nThe centre is today one of New Zealand's busiest malls, attracting over 12 million customers per year. Kiwi Property is currently investigating plans to undertake a $150 million expansion of the centre.\n\nStage Three was opened 29 March 2007, and included a cinema (along with the biggest 35 mm permanent movie screen in the world, according to the Guinness World Records), Borders bookstore, 45 new stores, bars and restaurants, and 26 stores which were either new to New Zealand or did not yet have stores in shopping centres.\n\nStage Four opened in June 2007, and finished the retail area of the centre, which now has 200 shops covering 6.5 ha of indoors space and is valued at NZ$450 million.\n\nThe opening of the relocated Sylvia Park railway station in July 2007, directly adjacent to the eastern side of the shopping centre, as required by the resource consent of the centre, links Sylvia Park to the Auckland rail network via the Eastern Line. As of May 2017, trains arrive at Sylvia Park at least every 20 minutes on weekdays.\n\nThe opening of Stage Five was planned for 2008 and to add NZ$200 million of office space in four separate buildings. Kiwi Income noted that it had always planned to develop offices around the perimeter of the centre, but had delayed this until the retail was starting to take off. Kiwi Property have begun the $280 million expansion, which sees the construction of a nine floor office block and 20,000 square meters of addition retail space.\n\n"}

The first issue was published in April 1987. The newspaper covers fundraising, accounting, managerial issues and human resource management. In addition to providing news and management tips to non-profits, the publication offers a job search engine, salary surveys, and an online TV show called The NonProfit Times TV.\n\nThe NonProfit Times releases a list of the nonprofit executives every year. Recent honorees include the late Peter Goldberg, Paul Shoemaker, and Scott Harrison. Those who are included in the link are honored with a gala at The National Press Club. The gala for the 2011 honorees occurred on September 15.\n\nIn September 2010, The NonProfit Times launched a bi-weekly webcast called The NonProfit Times TV. Each webcast runs at less than seven minutes, and covers the top news in the nonprofit sector. In addition, each episode includes an interview with a top executive at a nonprofit organization.\n\nAt the end of 2010, NPT released a series of salary survey reports designed to help nonprofit organizations with their compensation issues. The IRS requires nonprofit organizations to report the Compensation of Officers, Directors, Trustees, Key Employees, Highest Compensated Employees, and Independent Contractors on Part VII of Form 990 each year. The info included in these salary surveys will help organizations deal with these requirements.\n\nOn March 6, 2013, NPT launched its redesigned website, featuring an improved search function and other factors. According to NPT President/CEO John McIlquham, the relaunch was part of \"a year-long effort to meet the information needs of our readers and advertising partners.”\n\nIn 2010, The NonProfit Times added a job board called Nonprofit Jobseeker. The site lists the latest jobs from nonprofit organizations from all over the United States. The site is free to use for job seekers, though employers that wish to list their job openings have to pay a fee depending on the type of job package they choose.\n\nOn March 6, 2013, as part of the overall site re-design, the Nonprofit Job Seeker was integrated into the publication's main website.\n\n"}

{"id": "786944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=786944", "title": "Working poor", "text": "Working poor\n\nThe working poor are working people whose incomes fall below a given poverty line due to lack of work hours and/or low wages.\nLargely because they are earning such low wages, the working poor face numerous obstacles that make it difficult for many of them to find and keep a job, save up money, and maintain a sense of self-worth.\n\nThe official working poverty rate in the US has remained relatively static over the past four decades, but many social scientists argue that the official rate is set too low, and that the proportion of workers facing significant financial hardship has instead increased over the years. Changes in the economy, especially the shift from a manufacturing-based to a service-based economy, have resulted in the polarization of the labor market. This means that there are more jobs at the top and the bottom of the income spectrum, but fewer jobs in the middle.\n\nThere are a wide range of anti-poverty policies that have been shown to improve the situation of the working poor. Research suggests that increasing welfare state generosity is the most effective way to reduce poverty and working poverty. \n\nIn the United States, the issue of working poverty was initially brought to the public's attention during the Progressive Era (1890s–1920s). Progressive Era thinkers like Robert Hunter, Jane Addams, and W.E.B. Du Bois saw society's unequal opportunity structure as the root cause of poverty and working poverty, but they also saw a link between moral factors and poverty. In his study of Philadelphia's African American neighborhoods, W.E.B. Du Bois draws a distinction between \"hardworking\" poor people who fail to escape poverty due to racial discrimination and those who are poor due to moral deficiencies such as laziness or lack of perseverance.\n\nAfter the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II, the United States experienced an era of prosperity during which most workers experienced significant gains in wages and working conditions. During this period (1930s–1950s), scholars shifted their attention away from poverty and working poverty. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s American scholars and policymakers began to revisit the problem. Influential books like John Kenneth Galbraith's \"The Affluent Society\" (1958) and Michael Harrington's \"The Other America\" (1962) reinvigorated the discussions on poverty and working poverty in the United States.\n\nSince the start of the War on Poverty in the 1960s, scholars and policymakers on both ends of the political spectrum have paid an increasing amount of attention to working poverty. One of the key ongoing debates concerns the distinction between the working and the nonworking (unemployed) poor. Conservative scholars tend to see nonworking poverty as a more urgent problem than working poverty because they believe that non-work is a moral hazard that leads to welfare dependency and laziness, whereas work, even poorly paid work, is morally beneficial. In order to solve the problem of nonworking poverty, some conservative scholars argue that the government must stop \"coddling\" the poor with welfare benefits like AFDC/TANF.\n\nOn the other hand, liberal scholars and policymakers often argue that most working and nonworking poor people are quite similar. Studies comparing single mothers on and off welfare show that receiving welfare payments does not degrade a person's desire to find a job and get off of welfare. The main difference between the working and the nonworking poor, they argue, is that the nonworking poor have a more difficult time overcoming basic barriers to entry into the labor market, such as arranging for affordable childcare, finding housing near potential jobs, or arranging for transportation to and from work. In order to help the nonworking poor gain entry into the labor market, liberal scholars and policymakers argue that the government should provide more housing assistance, childcare, and other kinds of aid to poor families.\n\nDiscussions about the alleviation of working poverty are also politically charged. Conservative scholars and policymakers often attribute the prevalence of inequality and working poverty to overregulation and overtaxation, which they claim constricts job growth. In order to lower the rate of working poverty, conservatives advocate reducing welfare benefits and enacting less stringent labor laws. On the other hand, many liberals argue that working poverty can only be solved through increased, not decreased, government intervention. This government intervention could include workplace reforms (such as higher minimum wages, living wage laws, job training programs, etc.) and an increase in government transfers (such as housing, food, childcare, and healthcare subsidies).\n\nAccording to the US Department of Labor, the working poor \"are persons who spent at least 27 weeks [in the past year] in the labor force (that is, working or looking for work), but whose incomes fell below the official poverty level.\" In other words, if someone spent more than half of the past year in the labor force without earning more than the official poverty threshold, the US Department of Labor would classify them as \"working poor.\" (Note: The official poverty threshold, which is set by the US Census Bureau, varies depending on the size of a family and the age of the family members.) The US Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates working poverty rates for all working individuals, all families with at least one worker, and all \"unrelated individuals.\" The individual-level working poverty rate calculates the percentage of all workers whose incomes fall below the poverty threshold. In 2009, the individual-level working poverty rate in the US was 7%, compared to 4.7% in 2000. The family-level working poverty rate only includes families of two or more people who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' definition of family-level working poverty, a family is working poor if the combined cash income of the family falls below the poverty threshold for a family of their size. In 2009, the family-level working poverty rate in the US was 7.9%, compared to 5.6% in 2000. Finally, the unrelated individual working poverty rate measures working poverty among those who do not currently live with any family members. In 2009, 11.7% of employed unrelated individuals were poor, compared to 7.6% in 2000.\n\nIn Europe and other non-US, high-income countries, poverty and working poverty are defined in relative terms. A relative measure of poverty is based on a country's income distribution rather than an absolute amount of money. Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, classifies a household as poor if its income is less than 60 percent of the country's median household income. According to Eurostat, a relative measure of poverty is appropriate because \"minimal acceptable standards usually differ between societies according to their general level of prosperity: someone regarded as poor in a rich developed country might be regarded as rich in a poor developing country.\"\n\nWhen conducting cross-national research on working poverty, scholars tend to use a relative measure of poverty. In these studies, to be classified as \"working poor,\" a household must satisfy the following two conditions: 1) at least one member of the household must be \"working\" (which can be defined in various ways), and 2) the total household income must be less than 60% (or 50%, or 40%) of the median income for that country. Brady, Fullerton, and Cross's 2010 cross-national study on working poverty in high-income countries defines a household as working poor if 1) it has at least one employed person and 2) the total household income falls below 50% of the median income for that country. According to this relative definition, the US's working poverty rate was 11% in the year 2000, nearly double the rate produced by the US government's absolute definition. For the same year, Canada's working poverty rate was 7.8%, the UK's was 4%, and Germany's was 3.8%.\n\nPoverty is often associated with joblessness, but a large proportion of poor people are actually working or looking for work. In 2009, according to the US Census Bureau's official definition of poverty, 8.8 million US families were below the poverty line (11.1% of all families). Of these families, 5.19 million, or 58.9%, had at least one person who was classified as working. In the same year, there were 11.7 million unrelated individuals (people who do not live with family members) whose incomes fell below the official poverty line (22% of all unrelated individuals). 3.9 million of these poor individuals, or 33%, were part of the working poor. The cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 for a middle-income, two-parent family averaged $226,920 last year (not including college), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's up nearly 40% -- or more than $60,000—from 10 years ago. Just one year of spending on a child can cost up to $13,830 in 2010, compared to $9,860 a decade ago.\n\nUsing the US Census Bureau's definition of poverty, the working poverty rate seems to have remained relatively stable since 1978. However, many scholars have argued that the official poverty threshold is too low, and that real wages and working conditions have actually declined for many workers over the past three or four decades. Social scientists like Arne Kalleberg have found that the decline in US manufacturing and the subsequent polarization of the labor market has led to an overall worsening of wages, job stability, and working conditions for people with lower skill levels and less formal education. From the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s, manufacturing jobs offered many low-skilled and medium-skilled workers stable, well-paying jobs. Due to global competition, technological advances, and other factors, US manufacturing jobs have been disappearing for decades. (From 1970 to 2008, the percentage of the labor force employed in the manufacturing sector shrank from 23.4% to 9.1%.) During this period of decline, job growth became polarized on either end of the labor market. That is, the jobs that replaced medium-pay, low- to medium-skill manufacturing jobs were high-paying, high-skill jobs and low-paying, low-skill jobs. Therefore, many low- to medium-skilled workers who would have been able to work in the manufacturing sector in 1970 must now take low-paying, precarious jobs in the service sector.\n\nOther high-income countries have also experienced declining manufacturing sectors over the past four decades, but most of them have not experienced as much labor market polarization as the United States. Labor market polarization has been the most severe in liberal market economies like the US, Britain, and Australia. Countries like Denmark and France have been subject to the same economic pressures, but due to their more \"inclusive\" (or \"egalitarian\") labor market institutions, such as centralized and solidaristic collective bargaining and strong minimum wage laws, they have experienced less polarization.\n\nCross-national studies have found that European countries' working poverty rates are much lower than the US's. Most of this difference can be explained by the fact that European countries' welfare states are more generous than the US's. The relationship between generous welfare states and low rates of working poverty is elaborated upon in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Anti-Poverty Policies\" sections.\n\nThe following graph uses data from Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010) to show the working poverty rates for a small sample of countries. Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010) accessed this data through the Luxembourg Income Study. This graph measures household, rather than person-level, poverty rates. A household is coded as \"poor\" if its income is less than 50% of its country's median income. This is a relative, rather than absolute, measure of poverty. A household is classified as \"working\" if at least one member of the household was employed at the time of the survey. The most important insight contained in this graph is that the US has strikingly higher working poverty rates than European countries.\n\nThere are five major categories of risk factors that increase a person's likelihood of experiencing working poverty: sectoral factors, demographic factors, economic factors, labor market institutions, and welfare generosity. Working poverty is a phenomenon that affects a very wide range of people, but there are some employment sectors, demographic groups, political factors, and economic factors that are correlated with higher rates of working poverty than others. Sectoral and demographic factors help explain why certain people within a given country are more likely than others to be working poor. Political and economic factors can explain why different countries have different working poverty rates.\n\nSectoral tendencies\nWorking poverty is not distributed equally among employment sectors. The service sector has the highest rate of working poverty. In fact, 13.3% of US service sector workers found themselves below the poverty line in 2009. Examples of low-wage service sector workers include fast-food workers, home health aids, waiters/waitresses, and retail workers.\n\nAlthough the service sector has the highest rate of working poverty, a significant portion of the working poor are blue-collar workers in the manufacturing, agriculture, and construction industries. Most manufacturing jobs used to offer generous wages and benefits, but manufacturing job quality has declined over the years. Nowadays, many US manufacturing jobs are located in right-to-work states, where it is nearly impossible for workers to form a union. This means that manufacturing employers are able to pay lower wages and offer fewer benefits than they used to.\n\nDemographic factors\nIn her book, \"No Shame in My Game\", Katherine Newman finds that \"[t]he nation's young, its single parents, the poorly educated, and minorities are more likely than other workers to be poor\" (p. 42). These factors, in addition to being part of a large household, being part of a single-earner household, being female, and having a part-time (instead of a full-time) job have been found to be important working poverty \"risk factors.\" Immigrant workers and self-employed workers are also more likely to be working poor than other kinds of workers.\n\nEconomic factors\nThere is a widespread assumption that economic growth leads to tighter labor markets and higher wages. However, the evidence suggests that economic growth does not always benefit each part of the population equally. For example, the 1980s was a period of economic growth and prosperity in the United States, but most of the economic gains were concentrated at the top of the income spectrum. This means that people near the bottom of the labor market did not benefit from the economic gains of the 1980s. In fact, many have argued that low-skilled workers experienced declining prosperity in the 1980s. Therefore, changing economic conditions do not have as large of an impact on working poverty rates as one might expect.\n\nLabor market institutions\nLabor markets can be egalitarian, efficient, or somewhere in the middle. According to Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010), \"[e]fficient labor markets typically feature flexibility, low unemployment, and higher economic growth, and facilitate the rapid hiring and firing of workers. Egalitarian labor markets are bolstered by strong labor market institutions, higher wages, and greater security\" (p562). The United States has an efficient labor market, whereas most European countries have egalitarian labor markets. Each system has its drawbacks, but the egalitarian labor market model is typically associated with lower rates of working poverty. One tradeoff to this is that the \"lowest skilled and least employable\" people are sometimes excluded from an egalitarian labor market, and must instead rely on government aid in order to survive (p. 563). If the United States switched from an efficient to an egalitarian labor market, it might have to increase its welfare state generosity in order to cope with a higher unemployment rate.\n\nCentralized wage bargaining is a key component of egalitarian labor markets. In a country with centralized wage bargaining institutions, wages for entire industries are negotiated at the regional or national level. This means that similar workers earn similar wages, which reduces income inequality. Lohmann (2009) finds that countries with centralized wage bargaining institutions have lower rates of \"pre-transfer\" working poverty. The \"pre-transfer\" working poverty rate is the percentage of workers who fall below the poverty threshold based on their earned wages (not counting government transfers).\n\nWelfare state generosity\nCross-national studies are in agreement that the most important factor affecting working poverty rates is welfare state generosity. A generous welfare state spends a higher proportion of its GDP on things like unemployment insurance, social security, family assistance, childcare subsidies, healthcare subsidies, housing subsidies, transportation subsidies, and food subsidies. Studies on working poverty have found that these kinds of government spending can pull a significant number of people out of poverty, even if they earn low wages. Lohmann's 2009 study shows that welfare state generosity has a significant impact on the \"post-transfer\" rate of working poverty. The \"post-transfer\" rate of working poverty is the percentage of working households that fall below the poverty threshold after government aid has been taken into account.\n\nDifferent types of transfers benefit different kinds of low-wage families. Family benefits will benefit households with children and unemployment benefits will benefit households that include workers with significant work experience. Transfers such as old-age benefits are unlikely to benefit low-wage households unless the elderly are living in the same household. Sometimes, even when benefits are available, those who qualify do not take advantage of them. Migrants in particular are less likely to take advantage of the available benefits.\n\nThe working poor face many of the same daily life struggles as the nonworking poor, but they also face some unique obstacles. Some studies, many of them qualitative, provide detailed insights into the obstacles that hinder workers' ability to find jobs, keep jobs, and make ends meet. Some of the most common struggles faced by the working poor are finding affordable housing, arranging transportation to and from work, buying basic necessities, arranging childcare, having unpredictable work schedules, juggling two or more jobs, and coping with low-status work.\n\nHousing\nWorking poor people who do not have friends or relatives with whom they can live often find themselves unable to rent an apartment of their own. Although the working poor are employed at least some of the time, they often find it difficult to save enough money for a deposit on a rental property. As a result, many working poor people end up in living situations that are actually more costly than a month-to-month rental. For instance, many working poor people, especially those who are in some kind of transitional phase, rent rooms in week-to-week motels. These motel rooms tend to cost much more than a traditional rental, but they are accessible to the working poor because they do not require a large deposit. If someone is unable or unwilling to pay for a room in a motel, they might live in his/her car, in a homeless shelter, or on the street. This is not a marginal phenomenon; in fact, according to the 2008 US Conference of Mayors, one in five homeless people are currently employed.\n\nOf course, some working poor people are able to access housing subsidies (such as a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher) to help cover their housing expenses. However, these housing subsidies are not available to everyone who meets the Section 8 income specifications. In fact, less than 25% of people who qualify for a housing subsidy receive one.\n\nEducation\nThe issue with education starts many times with the working poor from childhood and follows them into their struggle for a substantial income. Children growing up in families of the working poor are not provided the same educational opportunities as their middle-class counterpart. In many cases the low income community is filled with schools that are lacking necessities and support needed to form a solid education. This follows students as they continue in education. In many cases this hinders the possibility for America's youth to continue on to higher education. The grades and credits just are not attained in many cases, and the lack of guidance in the schools leaves the children of the working poor with no degree. Also, the lack of funds for continuing education causes these children to fall behind. In many cases, their parents did not continue on into higher education and because of this have a difficult time finding jobs with salaries that can support a family. Today a college degree is a requirement for many jobs, and it is the low skill jobs that usually only require a high school degree or GED. The inequality in available education continues the vicious cycle of families entering into the working poor.\n\nTransportation\nGiven the fact that many working poor people do not own a car or cannot afford to drive their car, where they live can significantly limit where they are able to work, and vice versa. Given the fact that public transportation in many US cities is sparse, expensive, or non-existent, this is a particularly salient obstacle. Some working poor people are able to use their social networks—if they have them—to meet their transportation needs. In a study on low-income single mothers, Edin and Lein found that single mothers who had someone to drive them to and from work were much more likely to be able to support themselves without relying on government aid.\n\nBasic necessities\nLike the unemployed poor, the working poor struggle to pay for basic necessities like food, clothing, housing, and transportation. In some cases, however, the working poor's basic expenses can be higher than the unemployed poor's. For instance, the working poor's clothing expenses may be higher than the unemployed poor's because they must purchase specific clothes or uniforms for their jobs. Also, because the working poor are spending much of their time at work, they may not have the time to prepare their own food. In this case, they may frequently resort to eating fast food, which is less healthful and more expensive than home-prepared food.\n\nChildcare\nWorking poor parents with young children, especially single parents, face significantly more childcare-related obstacles than other people. Often, childcare costs can exceed a low-wage earners' income, making work, especially in a job with no potential for advancement, an economically illogical activity. However, some single parents are able to rely on their social networks to provide free or below-market-cost childcare. There are also some free childcare options provided by the government, such as the Head Start Program. However, these free options are only available during certain hours, which may limit parents' ability to take jobs that require late-night shifts.The U.S. \"average\" seems to suggest that for one toddler, in full-time day care, on weekdays, the cost is approximately $600.00 per month. But, that figure can rise to well over $1000.00 per month in major metro areas, and fall to less than $350 in rural areas.The average cost of center-based daycare in the United States is $11,666 per year ($972 a month), but prices range from $3,582 to $18,773 a year ($300 to $1,564 monthly), according to the National Association of Child Care Resource & Referral Agencies (NACCRRA).\n\nWork schedules\nMany low-wage jobs force workers to accept irregular schedules. In fact, some employers will not hire someone unless they have \"open availability,\" which means being available to work any time, any day. This makes it difficult for workers to arrange for childcare and to take on a second job. In addition, working poor people's working hours can fluctuate wildly from one week to the next, making it difficult for them to budget effectively and save up money.\n\nMultiple jobs\nMany low-wage workers have to work multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. In 1996, 6.2 percent of the workforce held two or more full- or part-time jobs. Most of these people held two part-time jobs or one part-time job and one full-time job, but 4% of men and 2% of women held two full-time jobs at the same time. This can be physically exhausting and can often lead to short and long-term health problems.\n\nLow-Status Work\nMany low-wage service sector jobs require a great deal of customer service work. Although not all customer service jobs are low-wage or low-status, many of them are. Some argue that the low status nature of some jobs can have negative psychological effects on workers, but others argue that low status workers come up with coping mechanisms that allow them to maintain a strong sense of self-worth. One of these coping mechanisms is called boundary work. Boundary work happens when one group of people valorize their own social position by comparing themselves to another group, who they perceive to be inferior in some way. For example, Newman (1999) found that fast food workers in New York City cope with the low-status nature of their job by comparing themselves to the unemployed, who they perceive to be even lower-status than themselves. Thus, although the low-status nature of working poor people's jobs may have some negative psychological effects, some, but probably not all, of these negative effects can be counteracted through coping mechanisms such as boundary work.\n\nScholars, policymakers, and others have come up with a variety of proposals for how to reduce or eliminate working poverty. Most of these proposals are directed toward the United States, but they might also be relevant to other countries. The remainder of the section outlines the pros and cons of some of the most commonly proposed solutions.\n\nCross-national studies like Lohmann (2009) and Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010) clearly show that countries with generous welfare states have lower levels of working poverty than countries with less-generous welfare states, even when factors like demography, economic performance, and labor market institutions are taken into account. Having a generous welfare state does two key things to reduce working poverty: it raises the minimum level of wages that people are willing to accept, and it pulls a large portion of low-wage workers out of poverty by providing them with an array of cash and non-cash government benefits. Many think that increasing the United States' welfare state generosity would lower the working poverty rate. A common critique of this proposal is that a generous welfare state would not work because it would stagnate the economy, raise unemployment, and degrade people's work ethic. However, , most European countries have a lower unemployment rate than the US. Furthermore, although Western European economies' growth rates can be lower than the US's from time to time, their growth rates tend to be more stable, whereas the US's tends to fluctuate relatively severely. Individual states offer financial assistance for child care, but the aid varies widely. Most assistance is administered through the Child Care and Development Block Grants. Check here to find the contact information for your state. Many subsidies have strict income guidelines and are generally for families with children under 13 (the age limit is often extended if the child has a disability). Many subsidies permit home-based care, but some only accept a day care center, so check the requirements. If you need to use an authorized provider, ask if they will put you in touch with an agency that can help you find one.\n\nSome states distribute funds through social or health departments or agencies (like this one in Washington State). For example, the Children's Cabinet in Nevada can refer families to providers, help them apply for subsidies and can even help families who want to pay a relative for care. North Carolina's Smart Start is a public/private partnership that offers funding for child care. Check the National Women's Law Center for each state's child care assistance policy.\n\nIn the conclusion of her book, \"Nickel and Dimed\" (2001), Barbara Ehrenreich argues that Americans need to pressure employers to improve worker compensation. Generally speaking, this implies a need to strengthen the labor movement. Cross-national statistical studies on working poverty suggest that generous welfare states have a larger impact on working poverty than strong labor movements. The labor movements in various countries have accomplished this through political parties of their own (labor parties) or strategic alliances with non-labor parties, for instance, when striving to put a meaningful minimum wage in place. The federal government offers a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) that's administered through workplaces.\n\nIf your job offers an FSA (also known as a Dependent Care Account), you can put aside up to $5,000 in per-tax dollars to pay for child care expenses. If both you and your spouse have an FSA, the family limit is $5,000—but you could get as much as $2,000 in tax savings if your combined contributions reach the maximum.\n\nSome argue that more vocational training and active labour market policies, especially in growth industries like healthcare and renewable energy, is the solution to working poverty. To be sure, wider availability of vocational training could pull some people out of working poverty, but the fact remains that the low-wage service sector is a rapidly growing part of the US economy. Even if more nursing and clean energy jobs were added to the economy, there would still be a huge portion of the workforce in low-wage service sector jobs like retail, food service, and cleaning. Therefore, it seems clear that any significant reduction in the working poverty rate will have to come from offering higher wages and more benefits to the current, and future, population of service sector workers.\n\nGiven the fact that such a large proportion of working poor households are headed by a single mother, one clear way to reduce working poverty would be to make sure that children's fathers share the cost of child rearing. In cases where the father cannot provide child support, scholars like Irwin Garfinkel advocate for the implementation of a child support guarantee, whereby the government pays childcare costs if the father cannot. Child support is not always a guarantee if the father or mother does not work. For example, if the parent without custody is not working then the parent with custody does not receive any child support unless the non working parent is employed at their job longer than 90 days, excluding if the non begins to work for its a city or government. Also, the government does not pay for childcare cost if you make more than the cut off range (your gross, per county or state.)\n\nHouseholds with two wage-earners have a significantly lower rate of working poverty than households with only one wage-earner. Also, households with two adults, but only one wage-earner, have lower working poverty rates than households with only one adult. Therefore, it seems clear that having two adults in a household, especially if there are children present, is more likely to keep a household out of poverty than having just one adult in a household. Many scholars and policymakers have used this fact to argue that encouraging people to get married and stay married is an effective way to reduce working poverty (and poverty in general). However, this is easier said than done. Research has shown that low-income people marry less often than higher-income people because they have a more difficult time finding a partner who is employed, which is often seen as a prerequisite for marriage. Therefore, unless the employment opportunity structure is improved, simply increasing the number of marriages among low-income people would be unlikely to lower working poverty rates.\n\nUltimately, effective solutions to working poverty are multifaceted. Each of the aforementioned proposals could help reduce working poverty in the United States, but they might have a greater impact if at least a few of them were pursued simultaneously.\n\n"}
