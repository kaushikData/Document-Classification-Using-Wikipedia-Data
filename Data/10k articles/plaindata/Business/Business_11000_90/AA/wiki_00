{"id": "572660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=572660", "title": "Absolute Power (radio and TV series)", "text": "Absolute Power (radio and TV series)\n\nAbsolute Power is a British comedy series, set in the offices of Prentiss McCabe, a fictional public relations company (or 'government-media relations consultancy') in London, run by Charles Prentiss (Stephen Fry) and Martin McCabe (John Bird).\n\nIt started in 2000 on BBC Radio 4, lasting until 2004 with the fourth and final radio series. A six-part television series ran on BBC Two towards the end of 2003; the second six-episode television series ran on BBC Two on Thursdays at 10 pm from 21 July to 25 August 2005. A one-off radio episode was broadcast on 3 November 2006.\n\nThe title is taken from a quotation by the historian Lord Acton: \"power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\".\n\nThe series was devised and written by Mark Tavener, and logically follows the series \"In the Red\", \"In the Balance\", \"In the Chair\", and \"In the End\" which he wrote with Peter Baynham. In some of these, Prentiss and McCabe (again played by Fry and Bird) are elevated members of the BBC, before getting kicked out. Indeed, there is a scene on the last page of the novel \"In the Red\", in which the newly appointed director general of the BBC gives them the sack.\nThe idea is that after this they created Prentiss McCabe, which is the subject of \"Absolute Power\". The tone and style of \"Absolute Power\" is so different from the \"In the...\" series that it can be regarded as a totally different programme. It was produced, like so much of Tavener's work, by Dawn Ellis.\n\nPrentiss is a man without morals, whose only objectives are money and power. He is portrayed as being the brains, while McCabe, though an excellent speech-writer, lacks his motivation and insight. McCabe's ambitions include retiring and drinking claret, and he spends his life in a state of cynicism, lack of energy and boredom. McCabe (who describes himself as \"a first class mind\") does sometimes have good ideas, but they usually become Prentiss's ideas by the time they are presented to the client, and he lacks the energy to make more than mild objections. McCabe is also more likely to baulk at a scheme for moral reasons than Prentiss.\n\nStephen Fry said of Charles Prentiss, \"He's a brute of a man, out to win, with no morals; he's completely shameless. There's not much to say that's nice about him, except that there is some pleasure in watching a natural born killer at work and knowing whatever happens he will win\".\n\nPrentiss and McCabe often find themselves working on behalf of two rival clients, one of whom is often the shadier side of the Labour Government, often called their \"Downing Street Retainer\". This is usually something of an inconvenience as Prentiss is met by Archie Hilditch (Tony Gardner, Alex Lowe), a faceless member of the Government, in a deserted location (such as Frank Dobson's campaign headquarters), and told he needs to ruin the popularity of the organisation that he has spent half the programme building up. For example, in one episode they're employed by the government to increase the popularity of the European Union, while also being employed by the Eurosceptic newspaper \"The Sun\" to increase sales. It is probably a good thing in the end, as the firm relies on these payments since neither Prentiss nor McCabe seems to want to do any real work.\n\nThe third member of the company is Sandy (Siobhan Hayes), who is there as the office trainee, getting work experience for her NVQ level 2. She usually does all the work that the partners in the firm cannot be bothered to do, such as filling out thousands of public opinion polls in different handwritings, though she will only agree to do something if it can be twisted into one of the 'nine levels of competence' of her NVQ. Another member of the office is the useless Clive (Tom George) or as Martin calls him, 'young, er, thing', who often turns publicity stunts into bloodbaths. He first appears in series three, after Sandy leaves the company to become a nurse (although due to her fiddling with the accounts, she still gets paid).\n\nAnother regular character is Maurice, the waiter at McCabe's club. Each time he serves McCabe's claret, he corrects the English pronunciation of Maurice (Morris) to the French (Maur-ees), and each time Prentiss puts him down with a verse like \"One man by circumstance is in splendour set; whilst another irons pants in a laundrette. Go and iron my pants, Morris\".\n\nIn series 1, one of the running jokes is the company trying to avoid working on \"The Sir Harold Dixon Account.\" Although he is never heard, it is known that he is a Conservative politician. As the series goes on, Sandy becomes more frustrated, and in the last episode she changes jobs and starts working for Sir Harold. However, after allegations of sleaze, Sir Harold is made bankrupt and Sandy returns to Prentiss McCabe.\n\nIn series 2, another character was created, Gayle Shand, played by Tamsin Greig. Gayle was a former employee of Prentiss McCabe and Charles's former girlfriend, with whom she had a heavily sexual relationship (they often made love whilst listening to classical music). However, the relationship fell apart after Gayle told Charles that she was already married to an insect specialist from Philadelphia. She now runs a rival firm to Prentiss McCabe, which is a much larger company, and is often trying to win Archie's contract, or is the agent of a rival client to Prentiss McCabe's current one. For example, whilst Charles and Martin work for the PM via Archie, Gayle is the spin doctor for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Prentiss McCabe always come up with a plan to keep Archie on their side, despite Gayle's attempts to stop them, even trying to make Charles a partner in her firm.\n\nAlso introduced was her assistant, Janice, who suspected that Gayle's personal rivalry with Charles did not lead to the best decisions.\n\nIn the last episode of series 2, Gayle was leaving for America, and made one last bet with Charles. She bet her company against Charles's testicles that he could not make the Home Secretary say, \"Prison doesn't work\". Despite Charles's best attempts, Gayle won because she bribed the Home Secretary, as she was having an affair with someone in the Home Office. Luckily, she called off the bet providing Charles could make love to her to the tune of the 1812 overture. Charles managed to get his own back, however, by planting some Class A Drugs in her suitcase as she left for America. Charles may nevertheless still have some feelings for her, and sometimes reminisces about their relationship.\n\nA one-off special episode was broadcast on 3 November 2006, with Tony Gardner playing Archie. In the special, Martin goes to jail for seven years for fraud (having been implicated in the Cash for Peerages scandal). Archie, who has left New Labour, then blackmails Charles into giving him a job to prevent any more embarrassing information getting out about the company.\n\nHowever, Charles soon learns that in fact Archie has framed both Martin and himself, with the assistance of Martin's girlfriend, and they are planning to take over Prentiss McCabe. After Charles finds proof, Archie goes to jail and Martin gets released, but as he has been moved to an open prison, he does not feel like leaving too soon.\n\nThe radio series is sometimes repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra as part of the \"Comedy Club\" hour.\n\nThe first episode of series 4 was controversially edited because of references to the Hutton Report. The words \"manipulation and lying\" was cut from Prentiss's line: \"There's nothing Prentiss McCabe can teach this Prime Minister about deception, manipulation and lying, except how to do it properly\".\n\nThe television series was written by Guy Andrews, Mark Lawson and Andrew Rattenbury, and had the tag \"spin is dead, long live PR\". Unlike most radio to TV sitcom transfers, none of the TV episodes was based on a radio episode. There are many differences to the radio version. Prentiss McCabe is a much more powerful and respected organisation than in the radio series. Martin McCabe is much more worldly wise. The secret meetings with government representatives are gone and replaced with more cups of coffee with newspaper editors and private secretaries.\n\nWhile the radio series has one trainee, the TV version has several young professionals working at the agency. Most notable are Jamie Front (James Lance) and Alison Jackman (Zoe Telford). While Jamie is a brilliant liar and naturally devious, Alison is very intelligent but too honest and somewhat literal-minded. Charles Prentiss said of her, \"Most of the young people here at Prentiss McCabe don't know their arse from their elbow, but with Alison, at least you know she'll join the Royal Arse Society and get a book about elbows from the library\". Also in the firm are Cat Durnford (Sally Bretton), the young party girl, and Nick Mayer (Nick Burns), Charles's personal assistant.\n\nInstead of political schemes, the agency concentrates on working with celebrities: something that is rare in the radio version. In the radio episode where McCabe works with a Big Brother contestant, this is shown as an exceptional event, but would be normal behaviour in the TV series. Contrariwise, in the TV episode \"The House of Lords\", Charles is mildly surprised to be contacted by a government spin doctor.\n\nNotable cameo and guest-starring roles in the television series have included:\n\nOwing to the terrorist attacks on London on the 7 and 21 July 2005, the first episode of the second series (in which a member of the bin Laden family attempted to buy British Airways) was replaced by an episode from later in the series. The bin Laden episode was aired several weeks later.\n\nSeries 1\n\nSeries 2\n\nSeries 3\n\nSeries 4\n\nSpecial Episode – (3 November 2006)\n\nSeries One\n\nSeries Two\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2508264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2508264", "title": "Accountant–client privilege", "text": "Accountant–client privilege\n\nAccountant–client privilege is a confidentiality privilege, or more precisely, a group of privileges, available in American federal and state law. Accountant–client privileges may be classified in two categories: evidentiary privileges and non-evidentiary privileges.\n\nAn evidentiary privilege is one that may as a general rule be successfully asserted in a court of law. A non-evidentiary privilege is (A) one that may not be maintained in a court of law, or (B) one which is, according to the terms of the statute granting the privilege, not applicable in the face of an order from the court compelling disclosure of the communication for which the privilege is claimed. The evidentiary and non-evidentiary versions of the accountant-client privilege are, as a general rule, creations of Federal or state statute.\n\nUnder English common law, on which American law is based, there was generally no accountant–client privilege. In the United Kingdom in particular the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 actually requires accountants (and solicitors, insolvency practitioners, etc.) who suspect their clients of tax evasion to report them to the authorities without telling the clients they have done so, subject to a maximum punishment of 14 years in jail. This affects even accountants who uncover a possibly inadvertent claim for expenses. In Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal took note of the American policy but refused to give any weight to it on the grounds that it is for Parliament to choose to enact a similar rule in Canada.\n\nSome states have enacted a non-evidentiary accountant–client privilege.\n\nFor example, Texas has a privilege rule that requires that a certified public accountant (CPA) not voluntarily disclose information communicated to the CPA by a client in connection with the engagement without the client's permission. The privilege generally does not apply, however, in the case of an administrative summons by the Internal Revenue Service under , in the case of a summons under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or in the case of a court order.\n\nThe \"federally authorized tax practitioner privilege\", is a limited evidentiary privilege available in American federal tax law. The privilege is defined in an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code made by the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998:\n\nUnder the law, the term \"federally authorized tax practitioner\" (or FATP) means an individual authorized under Federal law to practice before the Internal Revenue Service where the practice is subject to Federal regulation under . The term 'tax advice' means advice given by an individual with respect to a matter that is within the scope of the individual's authority to practice.\n\nThere are, however, some significant limitations on the FATP privilege.\n\nUnlike the attorney–client privilege, the FATP privilege does not apply in criminal matters, and does not apply in state tax proceedings. The privilege may be asserted only in a \"noncriminal tax matter before the Internal Revenue Service\" and a \"noncriminal tax proceeding in Federal court brought by or against the United States.\"\n\nThe FATP privilege applies only to communications made on or after July 22, 1998. The privilege does not apply to any written communication before October 22, 2004, between a federally authorized tax practitioner and a director, shareholder, officer, employee, agent, or representative of a corporation in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of such corporation in any tax shelter. Section 7525 was amended by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, so that the privilege does not apply to written communications made on or after October 22, 2004, involving a federally authorized tax practitioner with respect to the participation of any person (not just a corporation) in a tax shelter. This is a further limitation of the privilege.\n\nThe term FATP includes an attorney, a CPA, an enrolled agent, or an enrolled actuary. The FATP privilege does not generally apply to accountants who are not CPAs or EAs (unless they qualify as enrolled actuaries).\n\nThe FATP privilege might not apply to certified public accountants who are not licensed to practice in the state in which the client lives (for example, in a situation where the client lives in New Jersey but works in New York, where he consults a CPA who is licensed in New York but not in New Jersey). Because the CPA is not licensed to practice in the state where the client resides, the communication might not qualify for the privilege.\n\nThe FATP privilege applies only to tax advice. The advice must be treated as confidential by both the accountant and the client to be covered by the privilege. If the communication is divulged to third parties, then it is not confidential. The privilege does not cover general business consultations or personal financial planning advice.\n\nWith respect to communications involved in the preparation of tax returns, there is a split of authority. Much of the relevant case law was rendered prior to the creation of the FATP privilege in 1998, and relates to the attorney–client privilege.\n\nMost of the case law indicates that a communication in connection with tax return preparation is not covered. Under the argument accepted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, communication pertinent merely to preparing a tax return does not involve giving or receiving legal advice (see e.g., \"United States v. Gurtner\"). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, meanwhile, has held that tax returns are not privileged. This holding is based on the rationale that tax returns are intended for disclosure to a third party, i.e., the Internal Revenue Service, so there can be no expectation of confidentiality, which defeats a claim that the return or pertinent communication is privileged.\n\nOne minority view finds the privilege might apply to a communication about what to claim on a return. Another minority view is that such communications could be considered \"legal\" advice.\n\nOn balance, however, the weight of authority is that communication in connection with tax return preparation is probably not protected by the privilege.\n\n"}
{"id": "20646507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20646507", "title": "Agricultural marketing", "text": "Agricultural marketing\n\nEfforts to develop agricultural marketing have, particularly in developing countries, tended to concentrate on a number of areas, specifically infrastructure development; information provision; training of farmers and traders in marketing and post-harvest issues; and support to the development of an appropriate policy environment. In the past, efforts were made to develop government-run marketing bodies but these have tended to become less prominent over the years.\n\nEfficient marketing infrastructure such as wholesale, retail and assembly markets and storage facilities is essential for cost-effective marketing, to minimize post-harvest losses and to reduce health risks. Markets play an important role in rural development, income generation, food security, and developing rural-market linkages. Experience shows that planners need to be aware of how to design markets that meet a community's social and economic needs and how to choose a suitable site for a new market. In many cases sites are chosen that are inappropriate and result in under-use or even no use of the infrastructure constructed. It is also not sufficient just to build a market: attention needs to be paid to how that market will be managed, operated and maintained.\n\nRural assembly markets are located in production areas and primarily serve as places where farmers can meet with traders to sell their products. These may be occasional (perhaps weekly) markets, such as haat bazaars in India and Nepal, or permanent. Terminal wholesale markets are located in major metropolitan areas, where produce is finally channelled to consumers through trade between wholesalers and retailers, caterers, etc. The characteristics of wholesale markets have changed considerably as retailing changes in response to urban growth, the increasing role of supermarkets and increased consumer spending capacity. These changes may require responses in the way in which traditional wholesale markets are organized and managed.\n\nRetail marketing systems in western countries have broadly evolved from traditional street markets through to the modern hypermarket or out-of-town shopping center. In developing countries, there remains scope to improve agricultural marketing by constructing new retail markets, despite the growth of supermarkets, although municipalities often view markets primarily as sources of revenue rather than infrastructure requiring development. Effective regulation of markets is essential. Inside a market, both hygiene rules and revenue collection activities have to be enforced. Of equal importance, however, is the maintenance of order outside the market. Licensed traders in a market will not be willing to cooperate in raising standards if they face competition from unlicensed operators outside who do not pay any of the costs involved in providing a proper service.\n\nEfficient market information can be shown to have positive benefits for farmers and traders. Up-to-date information on prices and other market factors enables farmers to negotiate with traders and also facilitates spatial distribution of products from rural areas to towns and between markets. Most governments in developing countries have tried to provide market information services to farmers, but these have tended to experience problems of sustainability. Moreover, even when they function, the service provided is often insufficient to allow commercial decisions to be made because of time lags between data collection and dissemination. Modern communications technologies open up the possibility for market information services to improve information delivery through SMS on cell phones and the rapid growth of FM radio stations in many developing countries offers the possibility of more localised information services. In the longer run, the internet may become an effective way of delivering information to farmers. However, problems associated with the cost and accuracy of data collection still remain to be addressed. Even when they have access to market information, farmers often require assistance in interpreting that information. For example, the market price quoted on the radio may refer to a wholesale selling price and farmers may have difficulty in translating this into a realistic price at their local assembly market. Various attempts have been made in developing countries to introduce commercial market information services but these have largely been targeted at traders, commercial farmers or exporters. It is not easy to see how small, poor farmers can generate sufficient income for a commercial service to be profitable although in India a new service introduced by Thomson Reuters was reportedly used by over 100,000 farmers in its first year of operation. Esoko in West Africa attempts to subsidize the cost of such services to farmers by charging access to a more advanced feature set of mobile-based tools to businesses.\n\nFarmers frequently consider marketing as being their major problem. However, while they are able to identify such problems as poor prices, lack of transport and high post-harvest losses, they are often poorly equipped to identify potential solutions. Successful marketing requires learning new skills, new techniques and new ways of obtaining information. Extension officers working with ministries of agriculture or NGOs are often well-trained in agricultural production techniques but usually lack knowledge of marketing or post-harvest handling.\n\nAgricultural marketing needs to be conducted within a supportive policy, legal, institutional, macro-economic, infrastructural and bureaucratic environment. Traders and others are generally reluctant to make investments in an uncertain policy climate, such as those that restrict imports and exports or internal produce movement. Businesses have difficulty functioning when their trading activities are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. Inappropriate law can distort and reduce the efficiency of the market, increase the costs of doing business and retard the development of a competitive private sector. Poor support institutions, such as agricultural extension services, municipalities that operate markets inefficiently and inadequate export promotion bodies, can be particularly damaging. Poor roads increase the cost of doing business, reduce payments to farmers and increase prices to consumers. Finally, corruption can increase the transaction costs faced by those in the marketing chain.\n\nMost governments have at some stage made efforts to promote agricultural marketing improvements. In the United States the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is a division of USDA and has programs that provide testing, support standardization and grading and offer market news services. AMS oversees marketing agreements and orders research and promotion programs. It also purchases commodities for federal food programs. USDA also provides support to agricultural marketing work at various universities. In the United Kingdom, support for marketing of some commodities was provided before and after the Second World War by boards such as the Milk Marketing Board and the Egg Marketing Board. These boards were closed down in the 1970s. As a colonial power, Britain established marketing boards in many countries, particularly in Africa. Some continue to exist although many were closed at the time of the introduction of structural adjustment measures in the 1990s.\n\nSeveral developing countries have established government-sponsored marketing or agribusiness units. South Africa, for example, started the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) as a response to the deregulation of the agriculture industry and closure of marketing boards in the country. India has the long-established National Institute of Agricultural Marketing. These are primarily research and policy organizations, but other agencies provide facilitating services for marketing channels, such as the provision of infrastructure, market information and documentation support. Examples from the Caribbean include the National Agricultural Marketing Development Corporation (NAMDEVCO) in Trinidad and Tobago and the New Guyana Marketing Corporation in Guyana.\n\nNew marketing linkages between agribusiness, large retailers and farmers are gradually being developed, e.g. through contract farming, group marketing and other forms of collective action.\nDonors and NGOs are paying increasing attention to ways of promoting direct linkages between farmers and buyers within a value chain context. More attention is now being paid to the development of regional markets (e.g. East Africa) and to structured trading systems that should facilitate such developments. The growth of supermarkets, particularly in Latin America and East and South East Asia, is having a significant impact on marketing channels for horticultural, dairy and livestock products. Nevertheless, “spot” markets will continue to be important for many years, necessitating attention to infrastructure improvement such as for retail and wholesale markets.\n\n\n"}

They developed as a recreation and status symbol for rich businessmen.\n\nThe first aviation of this form developed immediately before World War I, when 'sporting' gentlemen, i.e. those both rich and with ample leisure time, could indulge in private flying. For the first time this regarded flight as a means of safe and reliable transport, not merely an achievement in itself. Right from the outset, the speed of flight and its ability to make long distances manageable was recognised as an advantage. The idea of seasonal commuting between New York and Florida, previously done by train, was one goal.\n\nAll aspects of aviation were spurred by World War I and there were many technical developments, particularly for engine reliability and the construction of larger, more robust aircraft, including seaplanes. Despite this, the time immediately after World War I was a recession in the aircraft industry, as the surplus market was flooded by ex-military machines and engines. Manufacturers sought any available market they could, including building a handful of specialised aircraft for the very rich. In a more buoyant climate, this minority market might have been less attractive.\n\nA typical air yacht of the early 1920s was the Kirkham Air Yacht, built to the order of . Vanderbilt intended it for transport between his business offices in New York and the family estate at . Like the contemporary Loening Flying Yacht, it included an enclosed passenger cabin for four with an open pilot's cockpit ahead. Both were of the most modern construction, as s with duralumin . A difference was that the Loening used a war-surplus whilst the Kirkham had the latest, and more powerful, British . Both were flying boats, able to land on any expanse of open water, which was available to the rich at both New York and their seaside country homes. The journey to Newport could be made in around two hours, three times faster than by train and still twice as fast as the journey by car today. As public airfields developed in this decade, later aircraft became s, making them more flexible about their destinations.\n\nIn 1927, Vanderbilt's Kirkham was destroyed in a hangar fire and he replaced it with a larger, six-seater Fokker. First the Fokker B.IIIC registered as NC149. This design had been developed by Fokker as the B.3 military patrol aircraft, but failed to sell to the and so had been converted with a passenger cabin and shipped to the US, meaning it was available to Vanderbilt at short notice. A crash in March 1928, or possibly a further hangar fire, destroyed Vanderbilt's Fokker and this was replaced by NC7887, an example of Fokker's new design. This was an design, making it much more flexible for travel inland. Flight in this 'Golden Age' period of aviation was developing rapidly in the US, and better airfield facilities were becoming available throughout the country.\n\nEven after the start of the Great Depression, these very-rich pilots were little affected and continued to order larger and larger custom-designed aircraft. Commercial land-based aircraft were also developing and many new owners, affluent but not super-rich, could afford a production-line aircraft when they could not afford a custom design. 'Production' in this pre-war era often meant only a handful of aircraft.\n\nAir yachts were owned by rich businessmen and were also found to be useful for purely business travel. These were mostly landplanes by now, rather than seaplanes. Belgian financier used a Trimotor for this purpose, but fell to his death from it in 1928. In time they gave rise to the wider use of .\n\nEarly air yachts and their owners:\n\nDespite its name, the (1928) was a 10-passenger small airliner, rather than an individual's 'air yacht' in this sense.\n\nIn the 2004 biopic \"The Aviator\", Howard Hughes is portrayed as wooing actress and fellow pilot Katharine Hepburn with flights in his Sikorsky S-38.\n"}
{"id": "2391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2391", "title": "Akio Morita", "text": "Akio Morita\n\nAkio Morita was born in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. Morita's family was involved in sake, miso and soy sauce production in the village of Kosugaya (currently a part of Tokoname City) on the western coast of Chita Peninsula in Aichi Prefecture since 1665. He was the oldest of four siblings and his father Kyuzaemon trained him as a child to take over the family business. Akio, however, found his true calling in mathematics and physics, and in 1944 he graduated from Osaka Imperial University with a degree in physics. He was later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and served in World War II. During his service, Morita met his future business partner Masaru Ibuka in the Navy's Wartime Research Committee.\n\nOn May 7, 1946, Ibuka founded \"Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha\" (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, the forerunner of Sony Corporation) with about 20 employees and initial capital of ¥190,000. Ibuka was 38 years old. Morita, 25 years old joined \"Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha\" shortly after its inception, with Morita's family investing in Sony during the early period and being the largest shareholder.\n\nIn 1949, the company developed magnetic recording tape and in 1950, sold the first tape recorder in Japan. In 1957, it produced a pocket-sized radio (the first to be fully transistorized), and in 1958, Morita and Ibuka decided to rename their company Sony (derived from \"sonus\"—–Latin for \"sound\"—–and \"Sonny-boys\" the most common American expression). Morita was an advocate for all the products made by Sony. However, since the radio was slightly too big to fit in a shirt pocket, Morita made his employees wear shirts with slightly larger pockets to give the radio a \"pocket sized\" appearance. In 1960, it produced the first transistor television in the world. In 1973, Sony received an Emmy Award for its Trinitron television-set technology. In 1975, it released the first Betamax home video recorder, a year before VHS format came out. In 1979, the Walkman was introduced, making it one of the world's first portable music players. In 1984, Sony launched the Discman series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products.\n\nIn 1960, the Sony Corporation of America (SONAM, currently abbreviated as SCA) was established in the United States. In 1961, Sony Corporation was the first Japanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, in the form of American depositary receipts (ADRs), which are traded over-the-counter. Sony bought CBS Records Group which consisted of Columbia Records, Epic Records and other CBS labels in 1988 and Columbia Pictures Entertainment (Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures and others) in 1989.\n\nOn November 25, 1994, Morita stepped down as Sony chairman after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage while playing tennis. He was succeeded by Norio Ohga, who had joined the company in the 1950s after sending Morita a letter denouncing the poor quality of the company's tape recorders.\n\nMorita was vice chairman of the Japan Business Federation (Japan Federation of Economic Organizations), and was a member of the Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group, also known as the \"Wise Men's Group\". He was also the third Japanese chairman of the Trilateral Commission. His amateur radio call sign is JP1DPJ.\n\nIn 1966, Morita wrote a book called \"Gakureki Muyō Ron\" (学歴無用論, Never Mind School Records), where he stresses that school records are not important to success or one's business skills. In 1986, Morita wrote an autobiography titled \"Made in Japan\". He co-authored the 1991 book \"The Japan That Can Say No\" with politician Shintaro Ishihara, where they criticized American business practices and encouraged Japanese to take a more independent role in business and foreign affairs. (Actually, Morita had no intention to criticize American practices at that time.) The book was translated into English and caused controversy in the United States, and Morita later had his chapters removed from the English version and distanced himself from the book.\n\nMorita was awarded the Albert Medal by the United Kingdom's Royal Society of Arts in 1982, the first Japanese to receive the honor. Two years later, he received the prestigious Legion of Honour, and in 1991, was awarded the First Class Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Emperor of Japan. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary British knighthood (KBE). Morita received the International Distinguished Entrepreneur Award from the University of Manitoba in 1987. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1999.\n\nMorita suffered a stroke in 1993, during a game of tennis. On November 25, 1994, he stepped down as Sony chairman. On October 3, 1999, Morita died of pneumonia at the age of 78.\n\n\n\n \n"}

It is the second installment in the \"Atlas Shrugged\" film series and the first sequel to the 2011 film \"\", continuing the story where its predecessor left off.\n\nThe film was released on October 12, 2012.\n\nDagny Taggart pilots an airplane in pursuit of another plane. Dagny asks herself, \"Who is John Galt?\" before apparently crashing into a mountainside.\n\nNine months earlier, Dagny is trying to understand the abandoned prototype of an advanced motor she and her lover Hank Rearden have found. Scientists across the country have been disappearing under mysterious circumstances, but Dagny is able to locate Quentin Daniels, who agrees to help from an abandoned laboratory in Utah.\n\nDagny's brother James Taggart, president of the family railroad company, meets store clerk Cherryl Brooks and brings her to see a renowned pianist, who disappears during his performance, leaving a note asking, \"Who is John Galt?\" Later, at James and Cherryl's wedding, Dagny's friend Francisco d'Anconia argues with other guests about whether money is evil, and secretly informs Rearden about devastating explosions at his copper mine—the next day. Rearden spends the night with Dagny. Later, he is confronted about the affair by his wife Lillian, but when he offers a divorce she declines, in order to maintain her position in society.\n\nRearden sells his advanced Rearden Metal to Ken Danagger's coal mining company, but refuses to sell it to the federal government, in defiance of the newly enacted \"Fair Share\" law that forces businesses to sell to all buyers. The two are charged under the law. Dagny barges into Danagger's office, realizes that he too is about to disappear, and understands that she is close to understanding the force behind the disappearances. At trial, Rearden defends individual freedom and the pursuit of profit, and is given only a token penalty by the court, which fears turning him into a martyr. The government announces \"Directive 10-289\", which freezes employment and production and requires that all patents be gifted to the government. Rearden defies this decree as well, but relents when he is blackmailed with photos of himself and Dagny that would damage Dagny's reputation.\n\nWhen Dagny hears about Rearden's \"gift\" and her brother's complicity, she quits the railroad. During her absence, a Taggart Transcontinental train collides with a military train in a tunnel, due largely to political pressure by a passenger and human error by Dagny's poorly trained replacement. This impels Dagny back to her job. D'Anconia tries to dissuade her from returning, as he had earlier tried to talk Rearden into leaving his business, but she returns anyway.\n\nDagny takes a train to Colorado to show her faith in the railway, but its engine fails. The repair technician used to work for 20th Century Motor Company, which produced the motor Dagny found. He tells Dagny how the need-based reward system in his company failed, and his coworker John Galt left the company vowing to \"stop the motor of the world.\" Dagny calls Daniels, who tells her that he is quitting. Dagny buys a small airplane and flies to Utah to try to dissuade him, but as she is landing, she sees him get into a plane on the airstrip.\n\nAfter a pursuit in the air—the opening scene of the film—Dagny's plane crashes in a valley hidden by stealth technology. A wounded Dagny Taggart crawls to the edge of her crashed plane, where she is greeted by John Galt.\n\n\nThe producers intended to finance \"Part II\" using profits from \"\". When that film failed to generate a profit, a private debt sale in early 2012 raised $16 million of the $25 million the producers sought, enabling a budget larger than that of the first film. There is some confusion about the relative size of the budget for the first two movies. The part 2 production budget was around $10 million and the marketing budget around $10 million, between 2010 and 2012. During the first movie a total of less than $20 million were spent over the course of the preceding 18 years. Hence, more was spent directly on producing the 2nd movie. The production company announced that Part 2 would be released to coincide with the U.S. general election season in fall 2012.\n\nDuncan Scott, who in 1986 was responsible for creating a new, re-edited version of the 1942 Italian film adaptation of Ayn Rand's novel \"We the Living\" with English subtitles, joined the production team.\n\nThe name of the production company for the second film, Either Or Productions, LLC, is taken from the title Rand gave to the middle section of her novel. An April press release stated the name of the film as \"Atlas Shrugged, Part 2: Either Or.\"\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 2, 2012 with an all-new cast, including Samantha Mathis as the heroine Dagny Taggart, Jason Beghe as the industrialist Henry Rearden, and Esai Morales as the playboy Francisco d'Anconia. Producer John Aglialoro has implied that hiring the cast of Part I for the sequel exceeded the movie's budget, saying \"it's hard to lock people down\", and also noting that Taylor Schilling, the actress who played Dagny in Part I, is \"a bona fide movie star now\". According to a report before the film was released, the film was to be on a 31-day shooting schedule, four days more than that of the first movie, and to undergo two months of post-production.\n\n\"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\" was not screened for critics before its release, with producer John Aglialoro questioning \"the integrity of the critics\". The film was screened for the conservative think-tank The Heritage Foundation and the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\n\"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\" opened on 1,012 screens and earned $692,000 on its premiere and $1.7 million its opening weekend, debuting at #11. Despite opening on more than three times the screens of \"Part I\", it did not significantly improve on \"Part I\"'s opening weekend.\n\nThe box office take totaled $3,286,255 through November 4, 2012, the last date for which the producers released numbers. When adjusted for inflation, the film had one of the two hundred least profitable wide openings of the past thirty years, followed by one of the two hundred largest week-over-week drops recorded for the same period. By the third week of release it was down to under 150 screens, taking in under $100,000 on its third weekend.\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 4% based on reviews from 23 professional critics, with an average score of 3/10, and the site's consensus is: \"Poorly written, clumsily filmed and edited, and hampered by amateurish acting, \"Atlas Shrugged: Part II\" does no favors to the ideology it so fervently champions\". Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 26 based on 11 reviews, which is interpreted as \"Generally unfavorable\" by Metacritic.\n\nFilm critics were not impressed with the film based on several reviews: reviewer Danny Baldwin gave the film a \"D\" rating; while the \"New York Post\"'s Kyle Smith gave the film a \"1\" rating (of 4), saying \"...even if you overlooked the production values from a 1986 porno and special effects like something your nephew cooked up on his Mac, the movie's \"Yay, money!\" zingers are just a big bag of sad.\" Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film a grade of \"F\", citing lack of story progression and poor character designs, and named it the second-worst film of 2012, claiming, \"The irony of Part II's mere existence is rich enough: The free market is a religion for Rand acolytes, and it emphatically rejected Part I.\" Jim Lane of the Sacramento News & Review gave it a mixed review, calling it \"a respectable effort hampered less by its limited budget than by the dogmatic contrivances of Rand's plot and the straw-man polemics of her wooden, declamatory dialogue.\"\n\nEconomics columnist John Tamny of Forbes.com gave the film a positive review and argued that it is \"a must see because it in a very handsome way describes the world in which we live today whereby the achievers are being shackled by the moochers.\"\nThe film was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Director for John Putch and Worst Screenplay.\n\nThe sequel and the third part in the trilogy, \"\", was released on September 12, 2014.\n\n"}

The computer software can provide scripting, prompts or interactive questioning to assist the call handler in gathering information.\n\nThe algorithms in the software will depend on the requirements of the service provider, the resources they have available, and the information that may be useful to resources dispatched or assigned to the call. The output is likely to be a prioritised list of tasks for action, where the action could be passing to another remote service (such as a telephony centre), dispatching a physical resource (such as an ambulance, police car or recovery truck) or closing the call without action. The advantage in using a computer based system is objectivity in decisions made, meaning a consistent service delivery.\n\nCall handling software can be linked to computer aided dispatch in order that this process is fully integrated, and information from the call handling software is passed directly to dispatch software where appropriate.

In 2015, his company, Retail Acquisitions Ltd, purchased the now collapsed retail chain British Home Stores from Philip Green for just £1 GBP together with a £10,000,000 equity injection into BHS Group Ltd. 13 months later the company was placed into administration resulting in the closure of 164 stores and the loss of 11,000 jobs.\n\nChappell was born in Sunbury on Thames, Surrey in 1966. He was educated at Millfield School in Somerset.\n\nChappell competed from 1986 to 1999 including British Formula Ford 2000, and British F3 in 1990, finishing runner up in the Class B Championship and British Formula 3000, Chappell competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in the GT1 class in 1994 (not classified), 1995 (did not finish) and 1996 (did not finish), and entered in the GT2 class in 1997 but failed to qualify.\n\nChappell launched the Interactive Sportscar Championship in the UK in 2001. The series folded after one race, leaving almost everybody unpaid, despite promises of payment.\n\nIn August 2016, Chappell was disqualified from holding a driving licence for six months and fined after pleading guilty to driving at over 63mph in a 40mph zone in Andover, Hampshire.\n\nChappell has been a director of various failed companies, and has been made bankrupt twice and entered into an individual voluntary arrangement once.\n\nHe was involved in the Island Harbour Marina development on the Isle of Wight.\n\nIt was reported in 2015 that Chappell, with the backing of investors, became the 90% owner of Retail Acquisitions, the firm that acquired British Home Stores (BHS) from Sir Philip Green for £1.\n\nIt subsequently transpired that instead of injecting new capital into the cash-strapped company as agreed with Arcadia, Chappell extracted £1,789,250 within three months of acquiring control of BHS.\n\nDuring the 13-month period he controlled BHS, Chappell by his own admission, extracted a total of £2,627,643 from BHS.\n\nOn 26 April 2016, it was reported that when it became likely that BHS would be going into receivership Chappell had moved £1.5 million from the firm to a company owned by a friend who was also a fellow board member of Retail Acquisitions. The sum had been later refunded at the request of BHS' chief executive Darren Topp (less £50,000 bank transaction fees).\n\nJust days after putting BHS into liquidation, and with its £571m pension deficit absorbed by the UK government's Pension Protection Fund, Chappell was said to be considering re-purchasing some parts of the firm. Reporting on this development, the BBC's Business editor Simon Jack noted: \"Sources at BHS treated the announcement with bewilderment. Other very senior retail sources used more colourful language. His credibility has taken a very serious knock. The details that have emerged about Dominic Chappell and his fellow directors' extraction of millions in professional fees has attracted widespread criticism\".\n\nOn 2 September 2016, another Chappell owned company, Swiss Rock plc was put into liquidation. The Statement of Affairs included unpaid VAT debts of £365,000 and outstanding Corporation Tax of £197,306.\n\nRetail Acquisitions Limited, the company used by Chappell to take over BHS in 2015 was wound up by the High Court of Justice on 3 May 2017 on the petition of BHS owed £6.1M in respect of an unpaid loan . Chappell had previously disclosed that Retail Acquisitions Limited had paid £1.5M to settle a mortgage debt secured on his parents’ home. \n\nChappell was found guilty of three charges of neglecting or refusing to provide information and documents to The Pensions Regulator at Brighton Magistrates’ Court on 11 January 2018 and ordered to pay a fine of £50,000 and £37,000 court costs. Chappell said he could not pay because he had “no funds”, and claimed he had extensive outgoings, of almost £9,000 per month made up of: £3,800 a month rent on a Dorset mansion; £2,666 a month leasing a 2017-plate Range Rover; and £2,500 a month school fees for his two children, aged eight and 12, on which he was in arrears. \n\nChappell is currently appealing the sentence which is due to be heard in September 2018\n\nOn 27 March 2018 the UK Insolvency Service announced that intends to ban Chappell, and three other former BHS directors, from serving as company directors for up to 15 years, following its investigation into the collapse of BHS under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. \n\n"}

{"id": "11079857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11079857", "title": "Edward F. Boyd", "text": "Edward F. Boyd\n\nEdward Francis \"Ed\" Boyd (June 27, 1914 – April 30, 2007) was an American business executive who was responsible for the marketing of products specifically to African Americans in an era when racial discrimination was rampant and blacks had either been ridiculed or systematically ignored in advertising. His efforts for Pepsi-Cola pioneered the concept of niche marketing and allowed Pepsi to substantially increase its market share in the black community at the expense of Coca-Cola. Boyd was a leader in the African-American business community.\n\nBoyd, an African American himself, was born and grew up in Riverside, California. After high school, he trained at a local opera company and wanted to be a diplomat. After graduating from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1938, he enjoyed a short film career, playing minor roles, often as stereotypical singing and dancing roles which he resented. During his time in Hollywood, he escorted Hattie McDaniel to the 1939 Academy Awards ceremony when she became the first African American performer to win the prestigious award. He later worked for the Screen Actors Guild, was the first African American to work for the Civil Service Commission in San Francisco, and then worked as a housing specialist for the National Urban League.\n\nWhen Boyd joined Pepsi in 1947, most U.S. businesses either ignored the African American market or depicted them using ethnic stereotypes such as the \"Mammy archetype\". But Walter S. Mack, president of Pepsi at the time, saw the potential of a vast untapped market. In fact, he had previously established an all-black sales team in 1940, but had to drop it due to the onset of World War II.\n\nBoyd's idea, revolutionary at the time, was to create advertisements that showed black Americans as normal, middle-class people. One such ad featured a smiling mother holding a six pack of Pepsi while her son (a young Ron Brown, who grew up to be Secretary of Commerce) reaches up for one. Another ad campaign, titled \"Leaders in Their Fields\", profiled twenty prominent African Americans such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Ralph Bunche.\n\nBoyd also led a sales team composed entirely of African Americans around the country to promote Pepsi. Racial segregation and Jim Crow laws were still in place throughout much of the U.S. and Boyd's team encountered a great deal of discrimination. Not only did they have to ride on segregated trains and stay in black-only hotels, but they faced insults from Pepsi co-workers and even endured threats from the Ku Klux Klan. On the other hand, they were able to use racism as a selling point, attacking Coke's reluctance to hire blacks and the support of segregationist Governor of Georgia Herman Talmadge by the chairman of Coke. As a result, Pepsi's market share (as compared to Coke's) shot up dramatically. After the sales team visited Chicago, Pepsi's share in the city overtook that of Coke for the first time.\n\nThis focus on the African American market caused some consternation within the company and among its affiliates. They did not want to seem focused on black customers for fear that whites would be pushed away. In a meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Pepsico president Mack, who favored progressive causes and was the impetus for this marketing push, tried to assuage the 500 bottlers in attendance by saying, \"We don't want it to become known as the nigger drink.\" Boyd understood that those were not Mack's sentiments. \"I didn't forget it, but I didn't hold it against him either,\" he told the \"Wall Street Journal\". After Mack left the company in 1950, support for the black sales team faded and Boyd was let go.\n\n\"Wall Street Journal\" writer Stephanie Capparell argues in her book \"The Real Pepsi Challenge\" that Boyd faced a more difficult challenge than Jackie Robinson in breaking the color barrier of corporate America. By doing the same work and competing for the same jobs as white people, Boyd's team presented more of a threat to the average white man.\n\nThere were few opportunities for a black man as a business executive at that time, but Boyd's career continued over a variety of public and private sector jobs. He was a mission chief for CARE, worked with the Society of Ethical Culture, and helped to pioneer alpaca farming in the U.S.\n\nBoyd's sister, Helen Boyd Howard, was married to Dr. T.R.M. Howard, a surgeon, entrepreneur, and civil rights leader in Mississippi who was a mentor to Medgar Evers and Fannie Lou Hamer.\n\nBoyd died in Los Angeles due to various complications including a stroke he had suffered nearly two months earlier.\n"}

ERSP is a program of the Electronic Retailing Association http://www.retailing.org in conjunction with the National Advertising Review Council (NARC) and administered by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The mission of the program is to enhance consumer confidence in electronic retailing, by providing a forum to self-regulate direct response advertising.\n\nERSP was created for several reasons, to: improve consumer confidence in electronic retailing; demonstrate the strong commitment of this industry to effective self-regulation; provide a quick and efficient mechanism for review of high-profile advertising (such as weight-loss advertising) and affecting the discontinuance of advertising containing egregious claims. ERSP investigates the truth and accuracy of claims in direct response advertising from inquiries brought to ERSP’s attention through competitor’s challenges, consumer’s concerns, or through ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. Working as a voluntary program, ERSP is an efficient and useful tool to assist direct response marketers with timely and cost effective measures to minimize government interference and increase consumer confidence. \n\nThe direct response industry includes long-form (infomercial) productions, short-form commercials, live home shopping channels, print advertising, Internet marketing, cell phone advertising, broadband channels, and radio advertising. Anything that has a direct link to the marketer: either a 1-800 number, email, or website is within ERSP’s purview.\n\nERSP inquires about the evidentiary support that a marketer possesses for product claims communicated through any form of direct-response advertising. Advertising claims come to ERSP’s attention through competitive challenges and ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. \n\nAmong the most significant benefits afforded by this program are:<br>\n• speed – the ERSP mandate is to resolve all inquiries within 60 calendar days<br>\n• cost –low cost alternative to litigation <br>\n• burden of proof – ERSP does not require that injury to a consumer be proven as may be required by law and<br> \n• confidentiality – a company may bring cases anonymously to ERSP and, conversely, any proprietary information submitted confidentially will remain so in an ERSP challenge.<br>\nThe 60-day structure of this program is vital in limiting marketer inconvenience, but comprehensive enough to provide a thorough review. The success of the program lies in the voluntary participation by direct response marketers and the nature of the self-regulatory format. With the beneficial nature of this format for the electronic retailing industry, ERSP looks forward to not only continuing its monitoring program but to addressing the challenges brought by both consumers and competitors of electronic marketing.\n\nCore claims at issue in an ERSP inquiry might include:\n\n• Establishment Claims (“Clinically proven”)<br>\n• Performance Claims (how well a product performs)<br>\n• Testimonials (Anecdotal tales from consumers about their results with the product)<br>\n• Weight Loss Claims<br>\n• Health and Safety<br>\n• Disclosures<br>\n• Before and After Photographs<br>\n• Puffery<br>\n• Comparative Claims\n\nERSP opened its first case in August 2004.\n\nERSP details its concerns in an initial letter of inquiry and the marketer is given 15 calendar days to respond to ERSP with substantiation for the issues raised. ERSP then has 15 calendar days to ask the marketer for more information regarding its submission. Upon receipt of that request the marketer has 10 days to answer ERSP’s questions, and upon receipt of that, ERSP has 15 calendar days to reach a decision. \n\nIf a marketer does not respond to the initial inquiry letter by ERSP, a press release summarizing the claims at issue and announcing a 10-calendar-day response for the marketer is released.\n\nParticipants in an ERSP review can anticipate one of three results:\n\n• ERSP determines that the core claims at issue are supported by reasonable evidence. <br>\n• ERSP recommends the marketer modify core claims.<br>\n• ERSP determines there is no support for the claims at issue and recommends that the advertiser pull the advertisement.\n\nERSP also refers marketers to the appropriate regulatory agency if they fail to respond or refuse to comply with ERSP’s findings. Compliance inquiries are also conducted to confirm compliance with ERSP recommendations.<br>\n\nIn January 2012, the Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program (ERSP) expanded its purview to monitor and review advertising of the coaching and mentoring and live seminar industry. The program is called the “ERSP Review Program.” The ERSP Review Program has two fundamental components: 1) review of telemarketing practices and free live seminar events which include telesales phone calls, scripts and recordings of free, live seminar events ; 2) monitoring of lead generation advertising applicable to the coaching and mentoring industry including print, broadcast and online advertising.\n\nIn 2014 ERSP introduced its Copy Reviewservice which is offered to members of the direct response industry and provides a review of advertising and the reasonable messages being communicated in the advertisement (usually conducted before the advertising is nationally disseminated). The review is focused on the legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and/or statutory provisions that should be considered and/or adhered to with respect to representations (express or implied) disseminated in an advertisement. Unlike a preclearance service which entails a comprehensive review of a marketer’s substantiation, a copy review evaluation is a “\"non evidentiary\"” review and is limited to “\"primary\"” and “\"core\"” claims communicated in an advertisement. Consumer complaints can be sent into ERSP via this complaint form.<br>\n\nCopies of previous ERSP case reports are located here.\n\n"}

It commissioned designs for many large-scale schemes, none of which were ever built.\n\nInitially its name was the Glass Age Town Planning Committee. The first committee consisted of first-generation modern architects Maxwell Fry, R Furneaux Jordan, Raymond McGrath, Howard Robertson, G Grey Wornum and FRS Yorke. Each was asked to ‘suggest solutions to certain problems of town planning in London, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Bournemouth’, using ‘all the structural and decorative resources of the Glass Age, but [to] produce practical schemes that could actually be built. An imaginative use of modern materials, rather than mere romantic fantasy was desired’. This being a marketing tool led by Pilkington, most of the problems were as unrealistic as the solutions. The designs followed early CIAM ideals in sweeping away historical areas such as The Strand and Bond Street in London, and Princes Street in Edinburgh in favour of extrusions of stacked floorplates walled in glass similar to the Miesian skyscrapers c1920.\n\nDuring the 50s the Committee was formed by Geoffrey A. Jellicoe, Edward D. Mills and Ove Arup & Partners; and it was joined by other architects for individual projects. The design briefs were for Britain in the year 2000, but realistic in that they were to make use of technology that was already available. Notable schemes included a proposal in 1955 to demolish the entire area of Soho and rebuild it entirely in glass; a 1957 proposal for the replacement of St Giles Circus in London with a tall glass heliport; and the 1963 \"Crystal Span\" proposal for the replacement of London's Vauxhall Bridge with a seven-story glass building straddling the River Thames, which was to have contained a shopping mall, luxury hotel, residential development and a museum to house the modern art collection now housed at Tate Modern.\n\nThe Glass Age Development Committee is best known for its ambitious 1968 proposal for a glass and concrete offshore city housing 21,000 people, to be anchored off the coast near Great Yarmouth and accessed from the mainland by hovercraft. The development was to have been called Sea City. The structure would have been long and wide, and would have rested on concrete islands supported by piers. It was intended that the development would have been economically self-sufficient thanks to boatbuilding workshops, fish farming, and the export of fresh water from an onboard desalination plant, while a lagoon in the centre of the development would support a tourist industry based on skin diving and water skiing.\n"}

From this moment on Wellness became the foundation of the Technogym philosophy and the tagline “The Wellness Company” was added to the corporate logo.\n\nIn 2001 Alessandri was nominated “Cavaliere del Lavoro” (Knight of Industry) by the President of the Italian Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, which made him the youngest-ever holder of this title in Italian history.\n\nIn November 2003 he was named Italian “Entrepreneur of the Year 2003” and then represented Italy at the “World Entrepreneur of the Year”.\n\nIn March 2004 he was elected to the Association of Italian Industrialists (Confindustria) Board of Directors and this mandate was renewed in 2008 for the next four years.\n\nIn April 2004 he received an honorary degree (Laurea Honoris Causa) from the Faculty of Motor Sciences at the University of Urbino.\n\nIn November 2004 he was presented the Leonardo Award for Italian Quality by the President of the Italian Republic.\n\nIn April 2005 he received an honorary degree (Laurea \"ad honorem\") from the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Bologna.\n\nIn November 2007 the United States Chamber of Commerce named Nerio Alessandri entrepreneur of the year in the economics category.\n\nIn February 2009 he was nominated Vice President of the Leonardo Committee, an association that promotes Italian quality and the image of Italy throughout the world.\n\nIn September 2009 Nerio Alessandri was nominated “World Heart Champion” by the World Heart Federation, the cardiology association of the World Health Organisation, for his commitment to promoting Wellness and a healthy lifestyle.\n\nIn May 2010 he was awarded the Guido Carli Award for the “Corporate Social Responsibility” category.\n\nHe received the \"America Award\" of the Italy-USA Foundation in 2017.\n\nCavaliere del Lavoro – (\"Knight of Industry\").\n\nWellness is a lifestyle based on regular physical activity, balanced diet and a positive outlook, first defined by Nerio Alessandri in the early 90s. The concept of Wellness is founded on the ancient Roman maximum of \"mens sana in corpore sano\" (a healthy mind in a healthy body) and is a genuine alternative to the American concept of fitness.\nFitness focuses on a small group of sports enthusiasts, whereas Wellness speaks to a much wider range of people who wish to improve their lifestyle.\n\nIn 2003, at the Wellness Congress organized in Cesena by the Wellness Foundation, Alessandri launched the slogan “Stare bene conviene” (Wellness pays) to highlight that a good psycho-physical condition is an all round advantage. For individuals who enjoy a better life. For companies, who can count on a more creative, more productive, more focused team. And for public health expenditure too, as a healthier population has less need of the National Health Service.\n\nIn 2003 the Wellness Foundation was established. This no profit association supports scientific research, health education and the promotion of a Wellness lifestyle. The Foundation operates with specific projects in the sphere of health, instruction, research, art and culture.\nThis foundation is the expression of the entrepreneur’s social responsibility, as it decides how to use its capital in social utility projects aimed at improving people’s quality of life with a particular emphasis on the local area in which the company is based.\nThis is why one of the main initiatives promoted by the Foundation is the “Wellness Valley, Romagna Benessere” project with the aim of enhancing the natural characteristics of the Romagna region and establishing it as a leader in terms of people’s quality of life.\n\nMoreover, in 2007, the Wellness Foundation promoted the “Cesena città che cammina” (Cesena, the walking city) project, which offered local people a free health check up and advice on illness prevention.\n\nIn 2008, together with the Municipality of Cesena and the local health service, the Foundation conducted a survey on the level of physical exercise practised by young people in Cesena. For many years now, the Foundation has worked together with a number of major prevention, research and care organizations to provide information and raise awareness of health issues.\nThese organizations include the Istituto Oncologico Romagnolo (Romagna Oncology Institute), the Lega Italiana Lotta ai Tumori (Italian Tumour Prevention League), and the Fondazione Italiana per il Cuore e Diabete Italia (Italian Heart and Diabetes Foundation) .\n\nThe Foundation also promotes the Wellness Congress, the main event for promoting and raising awareness of Wellness issues. The first congress was held in Cesena in 2003, and has since met every year in various countries around the world. Through the shared experiences of doctors, entrepreneurs, fashion designers, architects, and celebrities from the worlds of sport, culture and institutions, the Wellness Congress demonstrates how a healthy lifestyle can concretely improve people's quality of life, corporate performance and state expenditure.\n\nNerio Alessandri is the Technogym President and CEO. Today, Technogym is a world leader in the Fitness and Wellness solutions sector and boasts approximately 55,000 installations worldwide in 35,000 wellness centres and 20,000 private homes. Estimates suggest that approximately 20 million people use Technogym products every day.\nThe company has 2000 employees in 13 branches in Europe, the United States, Asia, the Middle East, Australia and South America and 90% of its turnover is made up of exports sent to over 100 different countries.\nIts revenues are 350M in 2010.\nThis company was the exclusive and official supplier for the athletes training centers at the last 4 editions of the Olympic Games since Sydney 2000 to Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and will be the same for London 2012 Olympics.\n\nAt the beginning of 2003 Alessandri became a shareholder in Enervit, a leading company in the sports nutrition sector.\n\nIn 2006 he purchased a 40% stake in Starpool, a company based in Trentino specialised in the design and construction of health spas.\n\nIn 2001 Alessandri published the book “Wellness. Scegli di vivere bene” (Wellness. Welcome to a better life) the manual-manifesto of the Wellness philosophy. In 2005 Technogym and Nerio Alessandri featured in the Italian edition of \"Blue Ocean Strategy\"< (), the Chan Kim – Mauborgne best seller. Featured in the 2007 publication \"Soft Economy\" (), Technogym was a case study in sound and flexible Italian enterprise that represents the best of Made in Italy. In the same year he edited the publication “Wellness-Storia e Cultura del vivere bene” (Wellness-The History and Culture of Healthy Living) (Sperling & Kupfer), a volume that defines the historical and conceptual path of wellness through twelve essays written by Italian and international academics.\nIn 2008, the book “A Successful Life Begins with Wellness” was published in China. This volume defines the concept of wellness in oriental society and includes personal testimonies by Nerio Alessandri and other important figures in the world of Chinese culture, business, sport and show business, describing how they have achieved success through Wellness.\nIn 2010 featured in the Bill Emmott best seller \"Forza, Italia - Come ripartire dopo Berlusconi\" () as an example of Italian excellence.\n"}
{"id": "2629394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2629394", "title": "Organizing (management)", "text": "Organizing (management)\n\nOrganising is a systematic process of structuring, integrating, co-ordinating task goals, and activities to resources in order to attain objectives.\n\nThe organizing of information could be seen since humans began to write. Prior to that, history was passed down only through song and word. As can be seen with religion, books and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history, but also supports the communication of history. Recording ideas in a written text, as opposed to verbally communicating with someone, and more specifically cataloging ideas and thoughts, is also an attempt to organize information.\n\nScience books are notable by their organization of a specific subject. Encyclopedias usually organize subjects into a single place, for faster indexing and seeking of meanings.\n\nThe following are the important characteristics of organization.\n\n\n\nOrganizing, in companies point of view, is the management function that usually follows after planning. And it involves the assignment of tasks, the grouping of tasks into departments and the assignment of authority with adequate responsibility and allocation of resources across the organization to achieve common goals.\n\nThe framework in which the organization defines how tasks are divided, resources are deployed, and departments are coordinated.\n\n\nWork specialization (also called division of labour or job specialization) is the degree to which organizational tasks are sub-divided into individual jobs. It may increase the efficiency of workers, but with too much specialization, employees may feel isolated and bored. Many organizations enlarge jobs or rotate assigned tasks to provide greater challenges.\n\nChain of command is the vertical lines of a command structure that is used for the purposes of overall responsibility and accountability in the achieving of stated goals and objectives through the use of orders one direction and reports of compliance in the other direction. Chain of command differs from horizontal lines in an organization which are basically the communication and coordinating lines of the organization.\nChain of command(also referred to as 'scalar principle') states that a clear , unbroken chain of command should link every employee with someone at a higher level, all the way to the top of the organisation.\n\n\nDelegation is the transfer of authority and/or responsibility to others, often lower in position. Delegation can improve flexibility to meet customers’ needs and adapt to competitive environments.\nPossible reasons for delegation:\n1. Efficiency - many people can complete a task faster than one/few\n2. Specialization - delegating simple tasks allows more important/complex tasks to be completed by the most qualified\n3. Training - delegating a task to a trainee so that they may learn from experience\n\nLine authority managers have the formal power to direct and control immediate subordinates. The superior issues orders and is responsible for the result and the subordinate obeys and is responsible only for executing the order according to instructions.\n\nFunctional authority is where managers have formal power over a specific subset of activities. For instance, the Production Manager may have the line authority to decide whether and when a new machine is needed but the Controller demands that a Capital Expenditure Proposal is submitted first, showing that the investment will have a yield of at least x%; or, a legal department may have functional authority to interfere in any activity that could have legal consequences. This authority would not be functional but it would rather be staff authority if such interference is \"advice\" rather than \"order\".\n\nStaff authority is granted to staff specialists in their areas of expertise. It is not a real authority in the sense that a staff manager does not order or instruct but simply advises, recommends, and counsels in the staff specialists' area of expertise and is responsible only for the quality of the advice (to be in line with the respective professional standards etc.) It is a communication relationship with management. It has an influence that derives indirectly from line authority at a higher level.\n\nCategories:\nFactors influencing larger span of management.\n\n\n\nDepartmentalization is the basis on which individuals are grouped into departments and departments into total organizations. Approach options include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3609555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3609555", "title": "Peer support", "text": "Peer support\n\nPeer support occurs when people provide knowledge, experience, emotional, social or practical help to each other. It commonly refers to an initiative consisting of trained supporters (although it can be provided by peers without training), and can take a number of forms such as peer mentoring, reflective listening (reflecting content and/or feelings), or counseling. Peer support is also used to refer to initiatives where colleagues, members of self-help organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other support on a reciprocal basis.\n\nPeer support is distinct from other forms of social support in that the source of support is a \"peer\", a person who is similar in fundamental ways to the recipient of the support; their relationship is one of equality. A peer is in a position to offer support by virtue of relevant experience: he or she has \"been there, done that\" and can relate to others who are now in a similar situation. Trained peer support workers such as peer support specialists and peer counselors receive special training and are required to obtain Continuing Education Units, like clinical staff. Some other trained peer support workers may also be law-enforcement personnel and firefighters as well as emergency medical responders.\n\nThe effectiveness of peer support is believed to derive from a variety of psychosocial processes described best by Mark Salzer in 2002: social support, experiential knowledge, social learning theory, social comparison theory and the helper-therapy principle.\n\n\nPeer mentoring takes place in learning environments such as schools, usually between an older more experienced student and a new student. Peer mentors appear mainly in secondary schools where students moving up from primary schools may need assistance in settling into the whole new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life. Peer mentoring is also used in the workplace as a means of orienting new employees. New employees who are paired with a peer mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship.\n\nThis form of peer support is widely used within schools. Peer supporters are trained, normally from within schools or universities, or sometimes by outside organizations, such as Childline's CHIPS (Childline In Partnership With Schools) program, to be \"active listeners\". Within schools, peer supporters are normally available at break or lunch times.\n\nPeer mediation is a means of handling incidents of bullying by bringing the victim and the bully together under mediation by one of their peers.\n\nA peer helper in sports works with young adults in sports such as football, soccer, track, volleyball, baseball, cheerleading, swimming, and basketball. They may provide help with game tactics (e.g. keeping your eye on the ball), emotional support, training support, and social support.\n\nPeer support can occur within, outside or around traditional mental health services and programs, between two people or in groups. Peer support is a key concept in the recovery approach and in consumer-operated services programs. Consumers/clients of mental health programs have also formed non-profit self-help organizations, and serve to support each other and to challenge associated stigma and discrimination. The role of peer workers in mental health services was the subject of a conference in London in April 2012, jointly organized by the Centre for Mental Health and the NHS Confederation. Research has shown that peer-run self-help groups yield improvement in psychiatric symptoms resulting in decreased hospitalization, larger social support networks and enhanced self-esteem and social functioning. There is considerable variety in the ways that peer support is defined and conceptualized as it relates to mental health services. In some cases, clinicians, psychiatrists, and other staff who do not necessarily have their own experiences of receiving psychiatric treatment are being trained, often by psychiatric survivors, in peer support as an approach to building relationships that are genuine, mutual, and non-coercive.\n\nIn Canada, the LEAF \"(Living Effectively with Anxiety and Fear)\" Program is a peer-led support group for cognitive-behavioral therapy of persons with mild to moderate panic disorders.\n\nIn a 2011 meta-analysis of seven randomized trials that compared a peer support intervention to group cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients suffering from depression, peer support interventions were found to improve depression symptoms more than usual care alone and results may be comparable to those of group cognitive behavioral therapy. These findings suggest that peer support interventions have the potential to be effective components of depression care, and they support the inclusion of peer support in recovery-oriented mental health treatment.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that peer support reduces fear during stressful situations such as combat and domestic violence and may mitigate Posttraumatic stress disorder. The 1982 Vietnam-Era Veterans Adjustment Survey showed that PTSD was highest in those men and women who lacked positive social support from family, friends, and society in general.\n\nPeer support programs have also been implemented to address stress and psychological trauma among law-enforcement personnel and firefighters as well as emergency medical responders. Peer support is an important component of the critical incident stress management program used to alleviate stress and trauma among disaster first responders.\n\nPeer support has been used to help survivors of trauma, such as refugees, cope with stress and deal with difficult living conditions. Peer support is integral to the services provided by the National Center for Trauma-Informed Care. Other programs have been designed for female victims of domestic violence and for women in prison.\n\nSurvivor Corps defines peer support for trauma survivors as \"Encouragement and assistance provided by a colleague who has overcome similar difficulties to engender self-confidence and autonomy and to enable the survivor to make his or her own decisions and implement them.\" Peer support is a fundamental strategy in the rehabilitation of landmine survivors in Afghanistan, Bosnia, El Salvador and Vietnam. A study of 470 amputee survivors of war-related violence in six countries showed that nearly one hundred percent said they had benefited from peer support.\n\nA peer support program operated by the \"Centre d’Encadrement et de Développement des Anciens Combattants\" in Burundi with support from the Center for International Stabilization and Recovery and Action on Armed Violence has assisted survivors of war-related violence, including women with disabilities, and female ex-combatants since 2010. A similar program in Rwanda works with survivors of the Rwandan genocide. Peer support has been recommended as a fundamental part of victim assistance programs for survivors of war-related violence.\n\nA 1984 study on the impact of peer support and support groups for victims of domestic violence showed that 146 battered women found women's peer support groups the most helpful source of a range of available treatments. The women in these groups appeared to give direct advice and to act as role models. A 1986 study on 70 adolescent mothers considered to be at risk for domestic violence showed that peer support improved cognitive problem-solving skills, self-reinforcement, and parenting competence.\n\nPandora's Aquarium, an online support group operating as part of Pandora's Project, offers peer support to survivors of rape and sexual abuse and their friends and family.\n\nTwelve-step programs for overcoming substance misuse and other addiction recovery groups are often based on peer support. Since the 1930s Alcoholics Anonymous has promoted peer support between new members and their sponsors: \"The process of sponsorship is this: an alcoholic who has made some progress in the recovery program shares that experience on a continuous, individual basis with another alcoholic who is attempting to attain or maintain sobriety through AA.\" Other addiction recovery programs rely on peer support without following the twelve-step model.\n\nPeer support has been beneficial for many people living with diabetes. Diabetes encompasses all aspects of people's lives, often for decades. Support from peers can offer emotional, social, and practical assistance that helps people do the things they need to do to stay healthy. Peer support groups for diabetics complement and enhance other health care services. J.F. Caro is the co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of one of such groups named Peer for Progress.\n\nPeer support has also been provided for people with cancer and HIV. The Breast Cancer Network of Strength trains peer counselors to work with breast cancer survivors.\n\nPeer support is considered to be a key component of the independent living movement and has been widely used by organizations that work with people with disabilities, including the Amputee Coalition of America (ACA) and Survivor Corps. Since 1998 the ACA has operated a National Peer Network for survivors of limb loss. The Blinded Veterans Association has recently launched Operation Peer Support (OPS), a program designed to support men and women returning to the US blinded or experiencing significant visual impairment in connection with their military service. Peer support has also benefited survivors of traumatic brain injury and their families. There is also FacingDisability for Families Facing Spinal Cord Injuries , which has a peer counseling program in addition to 1,000 videos drawn from interviews of people with spinal cord injuries, their families, caregivers and experts.\n\nSeveral programs exist that provide peer support for military veterans in the US and Canada. In 2010 the Military Women to Women Peer Support Group was established in Helena, MT.\n\nThe Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) provides peer support, crisis care, casualty casework assistance, and grief and trauma resources for families of members of the US military. Operation Peer Support (OPS) is a program for US military veterans who were blinded or have significant visual impairment.\n\nIn January 2013 Senator Patty Murray, Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, sponsored an amendment of the National Defense Authorization Act (S.3254) that would require peer counseling as part of a comprehensive suicide prevention program for US veterans.\n\nResearchers at the Palo Alto VA National Center for PTSD reviewed the literature on peer interventions for PTSD and found that studies fell into three broad categories, referred to as \"peer outreach for those exposed to traumatic events;” “paraprofessional peer delivery of a trauma-focused intervention” and “peer support for recovery from PTSD\". Peer support outreach for those exposed to traumatic events refers to programs that seek to identify and reach out to those suffering from or at risk for mental health problems following a traumatic event as a means of connecting those people to mental health services. Paraprofessional peers are defined as having a shared background as the target population and work closely with and supplement the services of the mental healthcare team. These peers are trained in certain interventions (such as Psychological First Aid) and are closely supervised by professional mental healthcare personnel. Peer support for recovery from PTSD refers to programs in which someone with lived experience of PTSD, who experienced a significant reduction in symptoms, provides formal services to those who have not yet made significant steps in recovery from his or her condition. The peer support for recovery model focuses on improvement in overall health and wellness, and has long been successful in the treatment of SMI (serious mental illness) but is relatively new for PTSD.\n\nA further review of existing literature found that carefully recruited, trained, supervised, and supported paraprofessionals can deliver mental health interventions effectively, and may be valuable in communities with fewer resources for mental healthcare.\n\nResearchers at the Palo Alto VA National Center for PTSD also conducted focus groups at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System Trauma Recovery Programs, a PTSD Residential Rehabilitation Program, and a Women's Trauma Recovery Program to determine veteran and staff perceptions of informal peer support interventions already in place. Four themes were identified, including \"peer support contributing to a feeling of social connectedness,\" \"positive role modeling by the peer support provider,\" \"peer support augmenting care offered by professional providers,\" and \"peer supporter acting as a 'culture broker' and orienting recipients to mental health treatment.\"\n\nThese findings have been put into practice through a peer support program for veterans in the Sonora, Stockton, and Modesto VA outpatient clinics. The clinics are part of the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Healthcare System that extend to more rural parts of northern California. The program is funded through grants in support of new treatment approaches to serve veterans in rural, traditionally underserved areas. Leadership for the program comes from the Menlo Park division of the Palo Alto VA system.\n\nThe peer support program has been operational since 2012 with over 268 unique veterans seen between 2012 and 2015. The two peer support providers involved in the program are veterans of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, respectively, and after having recovered from their own mental health disorders utilize their experiences to help their fellow veterans. The two providers have been responsible for leading between 5 and 7 groups each week as well as conducting telephone outreach and one-on-one engagement visits These services have successfully helped to augment the often overburdened mental health treatment teams at the central valley outpatient VA clinics.\n\nThe peer support program has been described in several publications. A personal story of success was featured in Stanford Medicine magazine and the collaborative nature of the program was described in the recently published book, Partnerships for Mental Health.\n\nSeveral peer based organisations exist for sex workers. The aim of these organisations is to support the health, rights and well being of sex workers and advocate on their behalf for law reform in order to make working safer. Sex work is work and there are many people who willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.\n\n\n"}

With his younger twin brothers and sister, he grew up in Beirut. After civil war broke out in 1975, his childhood was marked by deprivation and scenes of violence..\n\nRalph Yirikian graduated from the American University of Beirut with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1991. In 1992, he received a second bachelor's degree from the university, this time in business administration.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1992 Yirikian worked at AUB’s Jafet Library as an assistant in the Archiving and Documentation Department, and later as a computer operator at the Lebanese George Matta Establishment. In 1993, he worked as an executive secretary of Al Maha Group Holdings in Qatar, and as an Assistant management consultant at Nasser, Ghattas and Co, in Cyprus. \nFrom 1994 to 1996 Yirikian was the Head of the Administration and Personnel Department at Al Maha Group Holdings. From 1997-1999 he was the head of the Administration and Customer Service Department at Nasser, Ghattas and Co., in Cyprus. Between 1999 and 2001 Yirikian was the head of the Administrative Unit at LibanCell Company in the Lebanon. From February 2002 till July 2004 he was the General Manager of Karabakh Telecom.\n\nRalph Yirikian is VivaCell-MTS General Manager since November 2004. Under his leadership, in a short period of time VivaCell-MTS grew into an exemplary enterprise with over 60% of market share, about 1300 employees and one of the largest taxpayers of Armenia. \n\nVivaCell grew quickly and, in 2007, the company’s only shareholder, Fattouch Group, agreed to sell 80% of its shares to Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS), the largest mobile operator in the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russian Federation. As of today, VivaCell-MTS (MTS Armenia CJSC) shareholders are 80% MTS Russian MTS Group (Mobile TeleSystems PJSC) and 20% - Lebanese Fattouche Group. After acquisition by MTS also Ralph Yirikian stayed as the General Manager of VivaCell-MTS. Under his leadership, the Company continued striving and achieved new heights: first in Armenia 3G rollout based on UMTS/HSPA (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System / High Speed Packet Access) technology, launched on April 17, 2009, was a defining moment for the Armenian population. The introduction of 3G opened up new opportunities for the business and everyday life in the country . Further, on the 20th of December, 2010, VivaCell-MTS launched the first 4G/LTE network in Armenia and the region \n\n“VivaCell-MTS’ LTE roll-out positions Armenia to be one of the selected global leaders in 4G deployment. In addition, the launch of 4G is expected to present Armenia as a country with attractive communication infrastructure,” commented VivaCell-MTS General Manager Ralph Yirikian. Now, VivaCell-MTS’ 4G/LTE network, which is the largest in Armenia, covers 22 towns and is available to 52.5% of the population.\n\nHelping the society is part of the mission of VivaCell-MTS. Due to having Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach institutionalized at the Company level, and ingrained in its daily operations, VivaCell-MTS has become the pioneer of the corporate sector in promoting the concept of Corporate Responsibility in Armenia. In doing this, VivaCell-MTS has adopted the slogan “VivaCell-MTS is leading by example”, by calling other business entities to make CSR an integral part of their activity also. Starting from the first day of its operation, the Company has been making considerable social investments into the implementation of innovative projects in the spheres of Information and Communication Technologies, healthcare, culture, science, children, environmental protection, sport, education, and rural infrastructure, with focus on borderland. \n\n՞Businesses don’t exist in a geographical or social vacuum; they are a part of society and located physically in particular communities and areas. This is in part a general civic and social responsibility towards the local communities in which business operates.\n\nVivaCell-MTS is the first telecommunications operator in Armenia and the CIS that has successfully implemented ISO 26000 guidelines . \n\nIn 2016, VivaCell-MTS received a certificate of awarding for the widest and most developed network, efficient work with corporate customers, rendered innovative services and guidance by social responsibility from the National Association of Consumers. On February 28, 2017, the Company was recognized as “Accessible Mobile Operator” in the framework of “Accessible places” awards by the “Armenian Camp” NGO . \n\nIn the early days of VivaCell-MTS’ operation, Yirikian not only had to overcome the technical challenges of building a radio network, installing base stations in remote areas throughout the mountainous country, recruiting specialists, but he also had to battle with the remnants of Armenian business culture from the Soviet era. Yirikian explains that he urged his employees to take responsibility and make their own decisions. \n\nThe new culture of corporate management developed at VivaCell-MTS in the course of its activity gave birth to a lecture course called “Business with a Mission”, where the experience of more than 11 years of successful operation was summarized. At the beginning, the lecture was being delivered to university students who were hosted at VivaCell-MTS under the umbrella of Open Days at VivaCell-MTS frequently organized by the Company. Ralph Yirikian has been personally lecturing for senior school children and university students, by giving them an opportunity to physically get acquainted with how the Company operates, interacts with its customers and lives as a family.\n\nLater on, as a visiting lecturer, Ralph Yirikian was invited to numerous higher educational institutions to speak on the “Business with a Mission.” Also, based on the request by higher educational institutions, he delivers lectures on the basics of telecommunications and corporate culture\n\nRalph Yirikian is married and has one daughter and one son.\n"}

The property is classified as Class A office space and is constructed as a series of separate buildings. The original lands of the Seaport Centre were used as salt evaporation ponds on tidal lands of the San Francisco Bay, a land use that started sometime prior to 1940. As of 2002 leasing rates at Seaport Centre were in the range of $27 per square foot per annum. In 2005, Slough Estates, a United Kingdom-based REIT, purchased the entirety of Seaport Centre to develop it as a biotechnology research center to compete with the existing biotech hubs in Silicon Valley and South San Francisco.\n\nThe Seaport Centre is located on generally level ground at approximately above mean sea level. Stormwater surface runoff is pumped from Seaport Centre to discharge into Redwood Creek\n\nDue to the large scale of this area and its historical lack of accessibility, the area history can be revealed well with aerial photographic records. In 1989, the firm of Earth Metrics Incorporated conducted a review of historic aerial photographs dating back to 1956.(Earth Metrics, 1989) The Seaport Centre site and its environs, as of the 1956 aerial stereo photo, were essentially undeveloped, although extensive salt evaporation ponds were evident on site. Redwood City Planning Department records confirm that the site was used for salt evaporation since sometime prior to World War II.\n\nAnalysis of five sets of time staged stereo pairs of aerial photos reveal that the Seaport Centre site remained undeveloped until 1982; up until that time, city records show that the site was zoned as \"Tidal Plain\", a designation not allowing urban development. Area land use gradually changed from 1956 until 1982, in the form of gradual building development in the local area. As early as 1956 a rail spur is evident, which served the loading of raw sea salt for export from the area. No agricultural history is associated with the site, other than the salt harvesting.\n\nSince development of Seaport Centre in the early 1980s there has been a consistent trend of the property's use as a research and development hub for the biotech industry. In a 1989 tenant survey, some of the principal tenants present were: Vascualar Interventions Inc., Genelabs Incorporated, Precision Images Inc., Invitron, Charles Evans Inc., ICT Corporation, Resound Incorporated, Ideon Corporation, Cygnus Research Corp, Color Prep, Aurora Systems Inc., Abekas Video Systems Inc., Personics Inc., Instor Corporation and Visucom, Inc.\n\nA number of these early firms utilized a variety of hazardous materials in their normal processes. These substances included a variety of toxic solvents and other organic chemicals such as acetone, benzene, methyl ethyl ketone and toluene. Use of such chemicals on site is considered a risk, since the brackish groundwater at the Seaport Centre is shallow.\n\nCurrent tenants still largely focus on the medical and health fields and include: AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Bavarian Nordic, Codexis, Genomic Health, Guardant Health, Gynesonics, Minerva Surgical, OncoMed, Stem Cell Theranostics, and Teva.\n\n\n"}

Koch, the CEO of Koch Industries, Inc., wrote it in 2007. While many similarly-titled books by other authors exist, T. Boone Pickens argues that Koch's immense personal business success lends credibility to the book's concept.\n\nKoch has said that he initially wrote the book after the 2004 acquisition of Invista with the intent of using it as a sort of training manual to give a comprehensive picture of Koch Industries' business philosophy and to explain the principles of MBM to the new employees; Koch had initially conducted much of the training of new employees, but as the company grew, it soon became an impossible task, and necessitated the implementation of some other training method. He was later convinced to expand the \"training manual\" to share his philosophies with a wider audience.\n\nKoch credits much of the success of Koch Industries to effective implementation of Market Based Management (MBM), but indicates that it still has not been fully implemented throughout all of the conglomerate's subsidiaries. The book, however, will continue to serve as a means of spreading his philosophy within the company, and Koch's hope is that it will continue to improve business practices and create value for his companies, as well as for society at large.\n\nThe principles of Koch's MBM are taught to students, educators, community leaders and government officials by the Market-Based Management Institute, an educational non-profit, through their partnership with the Wichita State University (WSU).\n\nKoch credits two books with helping his intellectual formation: F.A. Harper's \"Why Wages Rise\" and Ludwig von Mises' \"Human Action\". He also credits several thinkers in his book with influencing his own thinking; most notably: W. Edwards Deming, Michael Polanyi, and his father, Fred Koch.\n\nAfter being unable to find contracts in the U.S., his father had spent time developing petroleum cracking plants in the Soviet Union in the 1920s under the communist regime of Joseph Stalin. He came back from his experience with great contempt for the totalitarian regime, having found the USSR to be \"a land of hunger, misery, and terror.\"\n\nAt least in part, the horrors of the totalitarian, communist regime made Fred Koch a staunch anti-communist, and a true believer in the merits of a free market. The free and uninhibited flow of ideas between workers and management in a relatively flat hierarchical structure that is perhaps the most central trademark of MBM stands in stark contrast to the innovation-stifling hierarchy of the USSR.\n\nKoch describes himself as a scientist and uses his self-proclaimed vast knowledge of wide-ranging topics such as history, politics, government, economics, psychology, human action and technology by demonstrating the ways that each affects business management, decision making, and profitability.\n\nThe publisher lists the five dimensions of MBM, each rooted in what it calls \"the Science of Human Action\":\n\nIn addition to describing the principles of MBM, Koch also gives an inside look into some of the important decisions that Koch Industries has made, and analysis of its successes and failures.\n\nThe book itself is not so much a how-to on running a business, but rather a philosophical treatise on effective management practices; \"a way of thinking—of looking at the world and making decisions based on specific principles.\" \nOne Forbes magazine reviewer noted that, \"Readers expecting a recipe book for business success will be disappointed, but those of a more philosophical bent will find Koch's observations fascinating.\"\n\n"}
