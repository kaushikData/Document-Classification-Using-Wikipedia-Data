Later, it began to be published by Saudi Research and Publishing Company, a subsidiary of Saudi Research and Marketing Group, on 12 January 1992.\n\nThe paper has a Gulf edition.\n\n\"Al Eqtisadiah\" is often called \"The Financial Times of Saudi Arabia\". Therefore, its target population is primarily businesspeople as well as academics, and senior government employees in the Kingdom and the GCC.\n\n\"Al Eqtisadiah\" is reported to rapidly secure a loyal readership of Saudi executives and government officials. The paper is also read by educated Saudi women and female students.\n\n\"Al Eqtisadiah\" is one of the daily newspapers published by Saudi Research and Publishing Company (SRPC), one of the Saudi Research and Marketing Group (SRMG) companies. The other daily newspapers published by SRPC are \"Arab News\" and \"Al Sharq Al Awsat\". The chairman of SRMG is Turki bin Salman Al Saud.\n\n\"Al Eqtisadiah\" is the only specialized business and financial newspaper in the Kingdom. The paper provides both news coverage and research, analysis and commentary on economic and business-related events at domestic, regional and international levels. It also provides the translated articles and news from major international business publications, including the \"Financial Times\", \"the Harvard Business Review\", \"INSEAD\", and \"Frankfurter\" regarding major economic events and developments.\n\nThe newspaper closely deals with consumer affairs as well as financial trends within the region and abroad. It offers its readers opinions about their financial initiatives and investments. It monitors the developments throughout the Kingdom by focusing on social and economic trends and uncovering important issues that have impact on communities as well as the country’s economy as a whole. Additionally, daily in-depth articles published provide an analysis of how developments may affect the Saudi economy.\n\nAlthough \"Al Eqtisadiah\" was founded as a financial daily paper, it is equally known for its political content, often printing editorials and opinion harshly critical of the US on a number of fronts. On the other hand, during the term of its former chief editor Abdul Wahab Al Faiz, \"Al Eqtisadiah\" a few years before 2009 appeared to return to its original finance-focus, gradually moving away from political opinion and focusing on themes of interest to the region's business elite.\n\nHowever, \"Al Eqtisadiah\" seems to return to the pre-Al Faiz period, since editor-in-chief Salman Al Dossari published an article challenging the Russia's stance over Syrian government on 24 March 2012. Specifically, Al Dossari harshly criticized Russia, especially Sergey Lavrov, for supporting Bashar Assad and argued that the same tactics used by Russia to oppress Muslim majority in Chechnya and the Caucasus have been used by Assad to oppress Sunni majority in Syria.\n\nThe paper also contains a section on environmental issues which is published weekly.\n\n\"Al Eqtisadiah\" had a circulation of 76,928 copies in the beginning of the 2000s.

While secretary to Pōmare IV of Tahiti, he fell in love with her twenty-year-old adoptive sister Oehau. For three days the queen cancelled the law forbidding a Tahitian to marry a foreigner, gave Princess Oehau the title \"ari'i\" Taimai, and they married.\n\nTheir daughter, Salmon's sister, Johanna Marau Ta'aroa (1846–1934), married her uncle, the future King Pōmare V, and was \"de facto\" ruler as Queen Marau (1877–1880) until he abdicated to the French colonial government. Another daughter married the Scottish merchant John Brander.\n\nTheir son, Alexander Jr, known as \"Pa'ea\" (Mangarevan for 'hobble'), inherited his father's business interests and became co-owner with Brander of the \"Maison Brander\" copra and coconut oil plantations in Tahiti, the Marquesas, and the Cooks.\n\nThe \"Maison Brander\" owned a large sheep ranch on Easter Island for exporting wool. The ranch was managed by the power-hungry convicted murderer Jean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier, who had acquired additional land and appointed his Rapanui wife \"Queen\". This was the low point in the island's history; by 1872 its resident population had been reduced to 111.\n\nIn 1871 Alexander Jr had picked up rudimentary Rapanui from his hundreds of indentured Easter Island labourers at the Mahina coconut plantation on Tahiti. In 1877 Queen Pōmare IV died, and Alexander's sister became regent. John Brander also died that year, and Dutrou-Bornier was assassinated. Alexander set off for Easter Island to manage the sheep station in around October 1878 with twenty Tahitian workers and an unknown number of Rapanui whose indentures had expired and ran the island for a decade. He introduced the coconut, the first sizeable tree on the island since its deforestation two centuries earlier, apart from some fruit trees at the SSCC Catholic mission and Dutrou-Bornier's estate.\n\nSalmon returned to Tahiti in 1883–1884 for business. Upon his return to Easter Island he bought up all remaining land apart from the SSCC mission at Hanga Roa. As owner of nearly all the island and sole source of employment, Salmon was \"de facto\" ruler.\n\nAs he was not a religious man, and a Jew, the priests did not like him, especially Hippolyte Roussel, who had been forced to leave the island in 1871 due to conflict with Dutrou-Bornier but who visited again in 1879. Bishop Jaussen in Tahiti appointed a Rapanui, Atamu te Kena, \"king\" to protect church interests from the \"Maison Brander\", but Salmon ignored him and he never had any influence. However, Salmon was an honest man and sincerely interested in the welfare of the people, and the population started to recover. This was the era of the strong Tahitian influence on the Rapanui language and culture.\n\nIn addition to wool exports, Salmon developed a tourist industry. He encouraged the manufacture of Rapanui artworks, including imitation \"rongorongo\" inscriptions, and helped sell them to passing ships for good prices as cultural artefacts, though he never claimed they were genuine. The artisans knew currency exchange rates and could deal with Europeans and Americans on their own terms.\n\nSalmon served as the principal informant for the British and to the island in 1882 and for the Americans in 1886, as guide, translator, and hotelier.\n\nCooke, surgeon of the USS \"Mohican\", which dropped anchor in December 1886, said,\n\nThe information Salmon provided, despite its often poor quality, is still among the most important of Easter Island's early historical period. He also sent three genuine \"rongorongo\" tablets to his niece's husband, Heinrich August Schlubach, the German consul of Valparaíso, which are now kept in Vienna and Berlin.\nSalmon sold the Brander Easter Island holdings to the Chilean government on 2 January 1888 and signed as a witness to the cession of the island. He returned to Tahiti in December of that year. He left for the remote Tuamotu Islands after being arrested and put in prison for assault and battery. He collected the oral histories of the people of the Tuamotus. He moved to San Francisco in later life and was involved in a scheme to marry ex-Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii, who he claimed he had been engaged to from birth. The plot was merely a heist to take Liliuokalani's money to pay his debt.\nHe died in 1914.\n\n"}

It is perhaps best remembered as America's first immigration station (predating Ellis Island), where more than 8 million people arrived in the United States from 1855 to 1890. Over its active life, it has also functioned as a beer garden, exhibition hall, theater, and public aquarium, and currently is a national monument.\n\nCastle Clinton stands approximately two blocks west of where Fort Amsterdam was built in 1626, when New York City was known by the Dutch name New Amsterdam. Construction began in 1808 and was completed in 1811. The fort, known as West Battery (sometimes Southwest Battery), was designed by architects John McComb, Jr. and Jonathan Williams. It was built on a small artificial island just off shore.\n\nWest Battery was intended to complement the three-tiered Castle Williams on Governors Island, which was East Battery, to defend New York City from British forces in the tensions that marked the run-up to the War of 1812, but it never saw action in that or any war. Subsequent landfill expanded Battery Park, and the fort was incorporated into the mainland of Manhattan Island.\n\nCastle Clinton National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.\n\nWest Battery was renamed Castle Clinton in 1815, its current official name, in honor of New York City Mayor DeWitt Clinton (who eventually became Governor of New York).\n\nThe United States Army stopped using the fort in 1821, and it was leased to New York City as a place of public entertainment. It opened as Castle Garden on July 3, 1824, a name by which it was popularly known for most of its existence, even to the present time. It served in turn as a promenade, beer garden/restaurant, exhibition hall, opera house, and theater. Designed as an open-air structure, it was eventually roofed over to accommodate these uses.\n\nIn 1850, the castle was the site of two concerts given for charity by Swedish soprano Jenny Lind to initiate her American tour. A year later, European dancing star Lola Montez performed her notorious \"tarantula dance\" in Castle Garden. In 1853–54, Louis-Antoine Jullien, the eccentric French conductor and composer of light music, gave dozens of very successful concerts mixing classical and light music. The Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company notably staged the New York premieres of Gaetano Donizetti's \"Marino Faliero\" on June 17, 1851, and Giuseppe Verdi's \"Luisa Miller\" on July 20, 1854, at Castle Garden.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, most immigrants arriving in New York City landed at docks on the east side of the tip of Manhattan, around South Street. On August 1, 1855, Castle Clinton became the Emigrant Landing Depot, functioning as the New York State immigrant processing center (the nation's first such entity). It was operated by the state until April 18, 1890, when the U. S. government assumed control of immigration processing, soon moving the center to the larger, more isolated Ellis Island facility on January 2, 1892. The new facility was needed because immigrants were known to carry diseases, which led to epidemics of cholera and smallpox.\n\nAfter many unnecessary deaths, and scandals over immigration workers cheating and stealing from immigrants, the immigration center was moved to Ellis Island. Most of Castle Clinton's immigrant passenger records were destroyed in a fire that consumed the first structures on Ellis Island on June 15, 1897, but it is generally accepted that over 8 million immigrants (and perhaps as many as 12 million) were processed during its operation. Called ' by Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews, a ' became a generic term for any situation that was noisy, confusing or chaotic, or where a \"babel\" of languages was spoken (a reference to the multitude of languages heard spoken by the immigrants from many countries at the site). Prominent persons associated with the administration of the immigrant station included Gulian Crommelin Verplanck, Friedrich Kapp, and John Alexander Kennedy.\n\nFrom 1896 to 1941, Castle Garden was the site of the New York City Aquarium. For many years, it was the city's most popular attraction, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The structure was extensively altered and roofed over to a height of several stories, though the original masonry fort remained.\n\nIn 1941, Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Commissioner Robert Moses wanted to tear the structure down completely, claiming that this was necessary to build the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. To expedite construction of the tunnel, the city closed the New York Aquarium and moved its fish to other aquariums in September 1941. Moses advocated for the demolition of Castle Clinton, but preservationists who opposed Moses's proposed action asked federal judge to grant an injunction to prevent demolition. Even though Moses initially got the injunction dismissed, the public outcry prevented his effort at demolition. However, the aquarium was closed and not replaced until Moses opened a new facility on Coney Island in 1957. Albert S. Bard, Walter D. Binger, and other civic reformers advocated to save the castle, which resulted in both houses of the United States Congress to pass legislation to make the castle a U.S. historic monument. President Harry S. Truman signed the legislation on August 12, 1946.\n\nAlthough Castle Garden had been designated a national monument, the city still owned the property. In July 1947, the New York City Board of Estimate voted to demolish Castle Garden. However, the Board delayed the demolition for another year to allow the federal government to review the decision. In May 1948, the Board voted to demolish the castle for the sixth time in as many years. After another year of discussion, the New York State Assembly reversed its decision to allow the castle to be demolished. The federal government finally obtained the property on July 18, 1950, after the city deeded the land and castle to the federal government. A major rehabilitation took place in the 1970s. It is currently administered by the National Park Service and is a departure point for visitors to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. It appears today much as it did in its earliest days; it has a museum and is again called Castle Clinton.\n\n\n"}

CLOs may be experts in corporate or personal training, with degrees in education, instructional design, business or similar fields.\n\nQualified CLOs should be able to drive the corporate strategy and align the development of people with the business goals of the organization. A full complement of skills, including business analytics, technology, learning theory, performance consulting and scientific inquiry, are important for success. \n\nThe CLO may report directly to the CEO, but may also report to the Head of HR or Chief Talent Officer.\n\nIn the 1990s, Jack Welch, then CEO of GE, made Steve Kerr his CLO, making GE the first company to have such an officer. Kerr also became the CLO and Managing Director for Goldman Sachs\n\nIn 2012, Emma Cunis, executive director of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants spoke at a CLO summit held in Mumbai. Cunis was part of a panel that discussed the cost of not investing in executive learning and development. She quoted former General Electric CEO Jack Welch to make her case: \"The Jack Welch of the future cannot be like me. I spent my entire career in the United States. The next head of General Electric will be someone who spent time in Bombay, in Hong Kong, in Buenos Aires…. We have to send our best and brightest overseas and make sure they have the training that will allow them to be global leaders who will make GE flourish in the future.\"\n\nThere are four types of learning techniques that may be employed by CLOs (Elkeles & Phillips, 2007):\n\nMeasurement techniques refer to how CLOs measure learning outcome success. These may take several forms and can include standardized tests, one-to-one interviews and discussions with individuals receiving learning assistance, surveys and questionnaires, and measured competency at various tasks before and after the learning activity (Rani, 2004; Rauner & Maclean, 2008).\nThe aim of the use of these measurement techniques is to quantify the success of the learning activity. This allows the CLO to adapt learning activities in future to increase the level of successful outcomes (Jonassen et al., 2008).\n\nA wide variety of different technologies may be used by CLOs in order to meet their learning objectives. Popular technologies used include the use of computer software to deliver lessons and tests. Additionally, internet based learning may be used to provide learning at remote locations and enable students to engage with lessons remotely (Iskander, 2008; Facer, 2011).\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania has their own Doctoral Program under their Graduate School of Education called the PennCLO Executive Doctoral Program. It specially prepares the Chief Learning Officers and other senior-level Human Capital Executives for success in their role as learning and talent development leaders.\n\nThere is scant data when it comes to the CLO position, considering that the position has only existed since 1991. In terms of salary, Indeed.com reports that the average salary is roughly $81,000 per year, as of May 2015. According to a CLO survey conducted in April 2015, roughly 45% of CLOs are female, which is a remarkably strong number for female representation in the c-suite. As a comparison, just 3% of CEOs are female, according to Pricewaterhouse Coopers.\n\nThe chief learning officer often works alongside the CEO and collaborates on his or her vision for instituting learning and development initiatives throughout the company. Occasionally the CLO will work closely with the chief technology officer, because much of L&D involves technological advancement. The chief knowledge officer will also assist the CLO in disseminating knowledge for employees to learn and apply. The chief culture officer will assist the CLO with any culture-based programs or initiatives, though most companies do not have a CCO at the moment.\n\nAcademic and practitioner publications dealing exclusively with CLO roles and responsibilities:\n\nRelated publications:\n\n"}

Most of the contracts are for police or fire / rescue / paramedic services to the county in which the city lies.\n\nIn the traditional method, \"franchising\", a private company has a franchise, or legal right, to perform certain public services normally done by municipal government. Cities of all kinds have entered into contracts for non-core governmental services, such as facilities and grounds maintenance, auditing, legal counsel, road construction, garbage collection, water and waste water treatment, engineering services, animal control, and others. Such cities rely on the private sector to provide public service delivery, while the public sector maintains oversight. Public officials are specifically responsible for writing, signing, managing and enforcing contracts.\n\nAnother method of contracting is for the city to contract with its county government or with neighboring cities to provide municipal services such as police and public safety, libraries, or parks and recreation. \n\nIn contrast, independent cities are cities which provide basic governmental services themselves, without contracting (this usage is not to be confused with the more common usage of independent city as a city that is not part of any county). Most older cities are independent cities. In practice, many cities are hybrids of both. For instance, they may directly operate parks programs, but contract with the county for police and fire services. Most contract cities do their own land use planning, since cities were incorporated to exert local control over land use.\n\nIn 1954, Lakewood, California, became the first city to contract with its county for public services. The previously unincorporated area was facing a hostile annexation from adjacent Long Beach, California, and residents favored retaining local control while maintaining the existing services provided by Los Angeles County.

A sequence of conduct after or under the agreement, however, is a \"course of performance.\"\n\nWhere a contract involves repeated occasions for performance and opportunity for objection \"any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.\" \"[S]uch course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance.\" This UCC section recognizes that the \"parties themselves know best what they have meant by their words of agreement and their action under that agreement is the best indication of what that meaning was.\"\n\nIt is well established that a written contract may be modified by the parties' post-agreement \"course of performance.\" \n\nA waiver that changes the express terms of a contract can be established by evidence of a course of performance. This holds true even for contracts that are fully integrated. The policy behind this \"broad doctrine of waiver\" in contract law is to \"prevent the waiving party from 'lull[ing] another into a false assurance that strict compliance with a contractual duty will not be required and then sue for noncompliance.' \"\n\nIt is not necessary that the contract be ambiguous before course of performance will be considered.\n\nA course of dealing is shown by repeated instances of the relevant conduct, not single occasions or actions.\n"}

{"id": "531483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531483", "title": "David Koch", "text": "David Koch\n\nDavid Hamilton Koch (; born May 3, 1940) is an American businessman, philanthropist, political activist, and chemical engineer. He joined the family business Koch Industries, the second-largest privately held company in the United States, in 1970. He became president of the subsidiary Koch Engineering in 1979, and became a co-owner of Koch Industries, with older brother Charles, in 1983, and served as an executive vice president until his retirement in 2018. Upon retirement in June 2018 due to health issues, Koch received the title of Director Emeritus. Koch is an influential libertarian. He was the 1980 candidate for Vice President of the United States from the United States Libertarian Party and helped finance the campaign. He founded Citizens for a Sound Economy. He and his brother Charles have donated to political advocacy groups and to political campaigns, almost entirely Republican. As of June 2018, he was ranked as the 12th-richest person in the world, (tied with his brother Charles), with a fortune of $50.7 billion.\n\n\"Condé Nast Portfolio\" described him as \"one of the most generous but low-key philanthropists in America\". Koch has contributed to several charities including Lincoln Center, Sloan Kettering, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and the Dinosaur Wing at the American Museum of Natural History. The New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, home of the New York City Ballet, was renamed the David H. Koch Theater in 2008 following a gift of $100 million for the renovation of the theater. Koch was the fourth richest person in the USA as of 2012, and the wealthiest resident of New York City as of 2013. He is a survivor of the USAir Flight 1493 crash in 1991.\n\nKoch was born in Wichita, Kansas, the son of Mary Clementine (née Robinson) and Fred Chase Koch, a chemical engineer. David's paternal grandfather, Harry Koch, was a Dutch immigrant who founded the Quanah Tribune-Chief newspaper and was a founding shareholder of Quanah, Acme and Pacific Railway. David is the third of four sons, with elder brothers Frederick R. Koch, Charles Koch, and nineteen-minute younger twin Bill Koch. Among his maternal great-great-grandparents were William Ingraham Kip, an Episcopalian bishop, William Burnet Kinney, a politician, and Elizabeth Clementine Stedman, a writer.\n\nKoch attended the Deerfield Academy prep school in Massachusetts, graduating in 1959. He went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning both a bachelor's (1962) and a master's degree (1963) in chemical engineering. He is a member of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity. Koch played basketball at MIT, averaging 21 points per game at MIT over three years, a school record. He also held the single-game scoring record of 41 points from 1962 until 2009, when it was eclipsed by Jimmy Bartolotta.\n\nIn 1970, Koch joined Koch Industries under his brother Charles, to work as a technical-services manager. He founded the company's New York office and in 1979 he became the president of his own division, Koch Engineering, renamed Chemical Technology Group. In 1985, Koch Industries was sued by Bill Koch and Frederick R. Koch for the first time in a long series of lawsuits about ownership, that lasted until 2001. As of 2010, David Koch owned 42 percent of Koch Industries, as does his brother Charles. He holds 4 U.S patents.\n\nOn June 5, 2018, the company announced his retirement from the company due to declining health issues.\n\nKoch was the Libertarian Party's vice-presidential candidate in the 1980 presidential election, sharing the party ticket with presidential candidate Ed Clark. The Clark–Koch ticket promised to abolish Social Security, the Federal Reserve Board, welfare, minimum-wage laws, corporate taxes, all price supports and subsidies for agriculture and business, and U.S. Federal agencies including the SEC, EPA, ICC, FTC, OSHA, FBI, CIA, and DOE. The ticket received 921,128 votes, 1% of the total nationwide vote, the Libertarian Party national ticket's best showing until 2016 in terms of percentage and its best showing in terms of raw votes until the 2012 presidential election, although that number was surpassed again in 2016. \"Compared to what [the Libertarians had] gotten before,\" Charles said, \"and where we were as a movement or as a political/ideological point of view, that was pretty remarkable, to get 1 percent of the vote.\"\n\nAfter the bid, according to journalist Brian Doherty's \"Radicals for Capitalism\", Koch viewed politicians as \"actors playing out a script\".\n\nKoch credits the campaign of Roger MacBride as his inspiration for getting involved in politics:\n\nHere was a great guy, advocating all the things I believed in. He wanted less government and taxes, and was talking about repealing all these victimless crime laws that accumulated on the books. I have friends who smoke pot. I know many homosexuals. It's ridiculous to treat them as criminals—and here was someone running for president, saying just that.\n\nKoch gave his own Vice Presidential campaign $100,000 a month after being chosen as Ed Clark's running mate. \"We'd like to abolish the Federal Elections Commission and all the limits on campaign spending anyway,\" Koch said in 1980. When asked why he ran, he replied: \"Lord knows I didn't need a job, but I believe in what the Libertarians are saying. I suppose if they hadn't come along, I could have been a big Republican from Wichita. But hell—\"everybody\" from Kansas is a Republican.\"\n\nIn 1984 he broke with the Libertarian Party when it supported eliminating all taxes. Since then, Koch has been a Republican.\n\nKoch considers himself a social liberal, supporting women's right to choose, gay rights, same-sex marriage and stem-cell research. He opposes the war on drugs. Koch supports policies that promote individual liberty and free market principles, and supports reduced government spending. Koch supports a non-interventionist foreign policy; \"Pursuing a very aggressive foreign policy,\" he says, \"is an extremely expensive endeavor for the U.S. government. The cost of maintaining a huge military force abroad is gigantic. It's so big it puts a severe strain on the U.S. economy, creating economic hardships here at home.\" Koch opposed the Iraq War, saying that the war has \"cost a lot of money and it's taken so many American lives\", and \"I question whether that was the right thing to do. In hindsight that looks like it was not a good policy\". In an impromptu interview with the blog ThinkProgress, he was quoted as saying he would like the new Republican Congress to \"cut the hell out of spending, balance the budget, reduce regulations, and support business.\" He is against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. He is skeptical about anthropogenic global warming. He has said a warmer planet would be good because \"Earth will be able to support enormously more people because a far greater land area will be available to produce food\".\n\nKoch has many thoughts on several of President Obama's policies. An article from the \"Weekly Standard\", detailing the \"left's obsession\" with the Koch brothers, quotes Koch stating that Obama is \"the most radical president we've ever had as a nation ... and has done more damage to the free enterprise system and long-term prosperity than any president we've ever had.\" Koch said that Obama's father's economic socialism, practiced in Kenya, explains why Obama has \"sort of antibusiness and anti-free enterprise\" influences. Koch said that Obama is \"scary\", a \"hardcore socialist\" who is \"marvelous at pretending to be something other than that.\" Koch contributed to both Republicans and Democrats in 2012, with the majority of his contributions going to Republican candidates.\n\nIn 1984, Koch founded, served as Chairman of the board of directors of, and donated to the free-market Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE). Richard H. Fink served as its first president. Koch is Chairman of the Board and gave initial funding to the Americans for Prosperity Foundation and to a related advocacy organization, Americans for Prosperity. A Koch Industries spokesperson issued a press release stating \"No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or David Koch specifically to support the tea parties.\" Koch was the top initial funder of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation at $850,000. Koch said that he sympathizes with the Tea Party movement, but denies directly supporting it, stating: \"I've never been to a tea party event. No one representing the tea party has ever even approached me.\"\n\nKoch sits on the board and donates to the libertarian Cato Institute and Reason Foundation.\n\nIn February 2012, during the Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election, Koch said of Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, \"We're helping him, as we should. We've gotten pretty good at this over the years. We've spent a lot of money in Wisconsin. We're going to spend more,\" and said that by \"we\" he meant Americans for Prosperity.\n\nKoch established the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation. Since 2006, the Chronicle of Philanthropy has listed Koch as one of the world's top 50 philanthropists.\n\nKoch says that his biggest contributions go toward a \"moon shot\" campaign to finding the cure for cancer, according to his profile on Forbes. Between 1998 and 2012, Koch contributed at least $395 million to medical research causes and institutions.\n\nKoch sits on the Board of Directors of the Prostate Cancer Foundation and has contributed $41 million to the foundation, including $5 million to a collaborative project in the field of nanotechnology. Koch is the eponym of the David H. Koch Chair of the Prostate Cancer Foundation, a position currently held by Dr. Jonathan Simons.\n\nIn 2006, he gave $20 million to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore for cancer research. The building he financed was named the David H. Koch Cancer Research Building .\n\nIn 2007, he contributed $100 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the construction of a new research and technology facility to serve as the home of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Since joining the MIT Corporation in 1988, Koch has given a total of $185 million to MIT. $15 million to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell Medical Center and $30 million to the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\nIn 2008, he donated $25 million to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to establish the David Koch Center for Applied Research in Genitourinary Cancers.\n\nIn 2011 Koch gave $5 million to the House Ear Institute, in Los Angeles, to create a center for hearing restoration, and $25 million to the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City\nIn 2013, he gave $100 million to NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, the largest philanthropic donation in its history, beginning a $2 billion campaign to conclude in 2019 for a new ambulatory care center and renovation the infrastructure of the hospital's five sites.\n\nIn 2015, he committed $150 million to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to build the David H. Koch Center for Cancer Care, which will be housed in a 23-story building in development between East 73rd and 74th Streets overlooking the FDR Drive. The center will combine state-of-the-art cancer treatment in an environment that supports patients, families, and caregivers. The building will include flexible personal and community spaces, educational offerings, and opportunities for physical exercise.\n\nIn July 2008, Koch pledged $100 million over 10 years to renovate the New York State Theater in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, now named in his honor and pledged $10 million to renovate fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nKoch has been a trustee of the American Ballet Theatre for 25 years and has contributed more than $6 million to the theater. He also sits on the Board of Trustees of WGBH-TV, which produces more than two-thirds of the nationally distributed programs broadcast by PBS.\n\nFrom 1982 to 2013, Koch contributed $18.6 million to WGBH Educational Foundation, including $10 million to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) show \"Nova\". Koch is a contributor to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., including a $20 million gift to the American Museum of Natural History, creating the David H. Koch Dinosaur Wing and a contribution of $15 million to the National Museum of Natural History to create the new \"David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins\", which opened on the museum's 100th anniversary of its location on the National Mall on March 17, 2010. He also serves on the executive board of the Institute of Human Origins. In 2012, Koch contributed US $35 million to the Smithsonian to build a new dinosaur exhibition hall at the National Museum of Natural History.\n\nKoch also financed the construction of the $68 million Koch Center for mathematics, science and technology at the Deerfield Academy, a highly selective independent, coeducational boarding school at Deerfield, Massachusetts, and was named its first and only Lifetime Trustee.\n\nKoch gave $10 million to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory where he was honored with the Double Helix Medal for Corporate Leadership for supporting research that, \"improves the health of people everywhere\".\n\nIn July 2015 David Koch and his brother were commended by both President Obama and activist Anthony Van Jones for their bipartisan efforts to reform the prison system in the United States. For nearly ten years the Kochs have been advocating for several reforms within the criminal justice system which include reducing recidivism rates, simplifying the employment process for the rehabilitated, and defending private property from government seizures through asset forfeiture. Allying with groups such as the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Coalition for Public Safety, and the MacArthur Foundation, the Kochs maintain the current prison system unfairly targets low-income and minority communities at the expense of the public budget.\n\nIn August 2010, Jane Mayer wrote an article in \"The New Yorker\" on the political spending of David and Charles Koch stating: \"As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in America.\" Mayer's article was criticized by conservatives for not enumerating the Kochs' charitable donations. Mayer's article was also criticized by Koch Industries as using \"psycho-biographic innuendo, unnamed sources, and half-truths\".\n\nAn opinion piece by journalist Yasha Levine in the \"New York Observer\" said Mayer's article failed to mention that the Kochs' \"free market philanthropy belies the immense profit they have made from corporate welfare\".\n\nKimberly O. Dennis, president and chief executive officer of the Searle Freedom Trust, said in 2010 that the Kochs are acting against their economic interest in promoting \"getting government out of the business of running the economy. If they were truly interested in protecting their profits, they wouldn't be spending so much to shrink government; they'd be looking for a bigger slice of the pie for themselves. Their funding is devoted to promoting free-market capitalism, not crony capitalism.\"\n\nIn 2011 \"Time\" included Charles and David Koch among the Time 100 of the year, for their involvement in supporting the Tea Party movement and the criticism they received from liberals.\n\nKoch married Julia Flesher in 1996. He has 3 children.\n\nIn 1992, Koch was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent radiation, surgery, and hormone therapy, but the cancer has returned every time. Koch has said he believes his experience with cancer has encouraged him to fund medical research.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51561203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51561203", "title": "Donald J. Trump Foundation", "text": "Donald J. Trump Foundation\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation was a New York-based private foundation founded and chaired by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States. \n\nTrump originally created the foundation to his proceeds from his book \"\" to charitable causes\".\" However Trump stopped contributing personal funds to the foundation in 2008 and instead solicited donations from outsiders.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election campaign the foundation's activities came under intense media scrutiny, initially by the \"Washington Post's\" David Fahrenthold, who went on to win the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his investigatory work. The foundation and its directors have since been accused of committing various ethical and legal violations, including self-dealing. In December 2016, Trump effectively closed the foundation, although New York State officials immediately blocked its legal dissolution pending completion of its then ongoing investigation.\n\nOn June 14, 2018, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed civil suit against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children, Donald, Jr., Ivanka, and Eric, alleging \"persistently illegal conduct\" with respect to foundation money, accusing them of engaging in campaign finance violations, using foundation money in their self-interest (\"self-dealing\"), and illegally coordinating donations with Donald Trump's presidential campaign. She ordered the charity dissolved and demanded $2.8 million in restitution and penalties. She also made referrals to the Federal Election Commission and the IRS. \n\nOn June 18 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office announced that the governor would refer the civil case to New York's Department of Taxation and Finance if it is requested to do so by the AG's office. The AG's office is not legally allowed to make the referral. Given the violations alleged in the civil case, some experts believe a tax investigation could lead to state criminal charges filed against President Trump.\n\nOn June 14, 2018, the new New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a civil lawsuit against the foundation, Trump himself, and Trump's three adult children, Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr., alleging that they had engaged in \"extensive unlawful political conduct\" and that Donald Trump had been using the foundation \"as his personal checkbook,\" to, among other things, settle his personal legal debts and support his presidential campaign.\n\nDonald Trump established the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 1988 as a private foundation so that he could distribute proceeds from his book \" to\" chartitable causes. The foundation was based at the Trump Organization in New York City and had no paid staff or dedicated office space . \n\nUntil 2017 the board of directors consisted of Donald Trump, his three adult children, and Trump Organization treasurer/CFO Allen Weisselberg (although in 2017 Weisselberg claimed to investigators he wasn't even aware he was a board member \"at least for the last 10 or 15 years\"). In 2015, a Trump Organization spokesperson told the \"New York Post\" that Trump made all decisions regarding the granting of Trump Foundation money.\n\nIn the 2018 lawsuit the New York Attorney General alleged that the Foundation's board of directors had not met since 1999.\n\nLike many other private foundations, the foundation conducted no charitable programs of its own. Instead, it granted money to other tax-exempt organizations. According to the foundation's IRS Form 990 filing for 2013, in making grants it did not impose on its directors any \"restrictions or limitations on awards such as by geographical areas, charitable fields, kinds of institutions, or other factors\".\n\nThrough 2015, Trump contributed $5.5 million to the Trump Foundation while outside donors contributed an additional $9.3 million. Trump's final gift to the foundation was $35,000 in 2008. \n\nMany of the outside donors to the foundation have done business with Trump or the Trump Organization. Several philanthropy experts noted that having a family foundation without any family money is unusual.\n\nThe top donors to the foundation from 2004 to 2014 were Vince and Linda McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). They jointly donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007 and 2009. The donations were reported by the Trump Foundation as coming from the WWE, but the WWE has said that the money came from Vince and Linda McMahon personally.\n\nIn September 2016 the New York Attorney General's office, which administers the state's Charities Bureau, announced it was investigating the Trump Foundation based on its failure to file required forms with the bureau. One week later the office issued a \"Notice of Violation\".\n\nIn December 2016, one month before his inauguration, then President-Elect Trump announced that he would dissolve the Trump Foundation to avoid \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President\". The New York Attorney General's office, however, blocked the dissolution, stating that the foundation \"cannot legally dissolve\" until its current investigation is completed. \n\nIn June 2018 the same office filed a civil lawsuit against the Trump Foundation and its board members ordering, among other requirements, that it be shut down and that restitution be made by its board members. The office also referred possible legal violations to the Federal Election Commission and the IRS. The following month, the New York State Governor's chief counsel announced that Governor Cuomo was ready to provide the state's Attorney General's office with the requisite criminal referral in the matter for possible criminal prosecution under state law.\n\nDuring the 2016 U.S. presidential election, David Fahrenthold of \"The Washington Post\" initiated an investigation into Trump's history of charitable giving after Trump had held a fundraiser for veterans in January 2016 in lieu of appearing at a televised Republican debate. Trump claimed that the event raised $6,000,000 for veteran's causes, including purportedly $1,000,000 of his own money. Fahrenthold began his investigation by attempting to verify the receipt and disbursal of the $6,000,000. All donations were supposed to have gone into the Trump Foundation and then granted by the foundation to others. Fahrenthold determined instead that, several months after the rally, the Trump Foundation had yet to disburse funds to any veteran-related charities. Although some of the funds went directly to causes without passing through the Trump Foundation, Fahrenthold widened his investigation into a larger investigation into Trump's history of charitable giving.\n\nIn June 2016, in response to criticism, Trump asserted publicly that he had given approximately $102 million to charitable causes from 2009 through 2015 and released a 93-page list of the beneficiaries of the money. Subsequent reporting by the \"Post\" and other news organizations found that many of the donations Trump claimed as having made personally over this 5-year period were made by the Trump Foundation, which by 2009, no longer held any money donated by Trump. Further investigations led to an increasing list of allegations of abuse inside the foundation since its creation. \n\nFahrenthold's investigation into the Trump Foundation and Trump's history of personal charitable giving involved hundreds of calls to charities associated with Donald Trump; it was also notable in that he drew heavily on support and investigative help from a large number of his Twitter followers who helped him track down leads on specific charities.\n\nFahrenthold received the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for his investigations into the Trump Foundation.\n\nAccusations against Trump and his foundation include the following:\n\nIn a June 2018 petition filed by the office of the New York Attorney General, it was explained that:\nIn an exhibit attached to the filing, Trump Foundation treasurer Allen Weisselberg claimed he hadn't been aware that he treasurer or on the board of the foundation until he was approached by investigators.\n\nUnder New York State law, a not-for-profit foundation must register as a \"7A Charitable Organization\" if it plans to solicit outside donations in excess of $25,000 in any year. The Trump Foundation was initially registered as a private foundation set up solely to receive his own personal donations. As long as it was registered as a private foundation and not soliciting outside funds, it did not have to file annual audited reports with the New York State Charities Bureau However, records show that Trump began soliciting donations at least as early as 2004 and possibly as early as 1989.\n\nIn April 2016, Fox News reported that, more than two months after Trump said he had raised $6 million for military veterans at a pre-Iowa caucus fundraiser, \"most of the organizations targeted to receive the money have gotten less than half of that amount.\" Around that time, Trump also said he had contributed $1,000,000 of his personal funds. In late May, Trump revised his figures downward, saying that $5.6 million had been raised at the event and that he had contributed his $1,000,000 share only the previous week, after the media criticized him. He also provided a list of the beneficiaries of the $5.6 million, although the full amount is further disputed in a lawsuit filed by New York State in 2018, which cites an amount of $2.8 million \n\nTrump may have used Trump Foundation grants to advance his presidential campaign, in violation of rules barring charities from engaging in political activity. Trump distributed at least some of the funds publicly at \"Donald Trump for President\" political rallies, displaying large-size donation checks that included his campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again\" or a link to a campaign website.\n\nTrump Organization CFO Allen Weissberg testified in an October 2017 deposition that he witnessed Donald Trump's campaign staff coordinate with Trump to use the Iowa fundraiser to benefit the campaign. In 2018, New York State Attorney General Barbara Underwood alleged in a larger suit against the foundation that Trump, in using the foundation to promote his campaign during and after the Iowa fundraiser, had violated charities laws.\n\nIn each of 1995 and 1999, the Trump Foundation granted $50,000 to the National Museum of Catholic Art and Library. A 2001 report by \"The Village Voice\" stated, after visiting the museum in East Harlem, that the facility had \"next to no art\" and no official connection to the Catholic church, despite having had a 10-year track record of soliciting large-scale donations for its collection. The \"Voice\" and, later, \"The Washington Post\", concluded that Trump may have directed the grants to the museum to curry favor with the museum's then chairman, Eddie Malloy, who was also head of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. The Council had worked on behalf of one of the unions of workers who worked on Trump construction projects.\n\nAn investigation by the New York City Comptroller's office in October 2016 showed that Trump and/or the Donald Trump Foundation may have failed to honor at least one pledge to charities established to provide relief for victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Trump had made a pledge of $10,000 to the Twin Towers Fund on \"The Howard Stern Show\" in late September 2001. The Twin Towers Fund, later administered as part of the New York City Public and Private Initiative, was created by then-New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani \"to benefit the families of firefighters and police officers who died in the attacks.\n\nDuring the 2016 Republican National Convention, Giuliani announced that Trump had made unspecified \"anonymous\" donations after the Sep 11 attacks, although such donations have not been identified. Giuliani also said, in support of Trump's candidacy, \"Every time New York City suffered a tragedy Donald Trump was there to help... He's not going to like my telling you this but he did it anonymously.\"\n\nThe New York City Comptroller's office told the \"New York Daily News\" it had manually reviewed \"approximately 1,500 pages of donor records of the Twin Towers Fund and the related entity NYC Public/Private Initiatives Inc., containing the names of more than 110,000 individuals and entities that were collected as part of the audits\" through August 2012. According to the \"News\", Comptroller Scott Stringer \"found that Trump and [the Trump Foundation] hadn't donated a dime in the months after 9/11\"; however, because the reviewed period only covered one year after the attacks, the Comptroller's office was \"unable to conclude definitively\" that Trump never gave to the fund after August 2002. According to its IRS Form 990 tax filings, the Trump Foundation made no grants to the Twin Towers Fund or to NYC Public/Private Initiatives, Inc. from 2002 through 2014, although Trump may have made personal donations after August 2002 that would not have shown up in these filings.\n\nIn 2016, after the convention, Trump's campaign suggested that the Trump Foundation made a grant to the American Red Cross after the attacks; however no record of this exists in the foundation's tax filings from 2001 through 2014. As with the Twin Towers Fund, if Trump instead had made a personal donation, it would not have shown up in the foundation's records.\n\nTrump may have used foundation money to settle his personal or business legal disputes on at least two occasions.\n\nIn 2007, Trump used Trump Foundation funds to settle a 2006 legal dispute between the Town of Palm Beach, Florida, and Trump's Mar-a-Lago country club. The town said that the club's flagpole violated town height limit rules and levied a daily accruing fine against the club. The club's flagpole was 80 feet tall, 38 feet above limits imposed by the town. Palm Beach began fining Trump $1,250 per day for the violation. Trump countersued Palm Beach for $25 million on US constitutional grounds for restricting his 1st amendment rights of free speech and his 14th amendment rights of equal protection. The suit alleged that at least 20 other properties had violated the height restrictions but were not similarly fined. It also alleged that a shorter flagpole \"would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump's…patriotism.\" Trump eventually reached a legal settlement with Palm Beach after, according to the \"Sun Sentinel,\" \"secret, court-ordered negotiations.\" Settlement documents show that Trump, in return for discharging the club's obligations to Palm Beach, had agreed to personally donate $100,000 to Fischer House, a charity benefitting veterans and military families. However, Trump then made the grant using foundation money, not his own.\n\nTrump's foundation paid $158,000 to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation as a settlement of a lawsuit brought by Greenberg against the Trump National Golf Club Westchester in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Greenberg alleged that he had rightfully won a $1 million prize for scoring a hole-in-one in a 2010 charity golf tournament at the club. But the club denied the award on technical grounds, arguing that the hole was shorter than the required 150 yards. Martin Greenberg sued and a settlement was reached at a significantly reduced amount. \"The Washington Post\" reported that \"on the day that Trump and the other parties told the court that they had settled the case, the Donald J. Trump Foundation made its first and only grant to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation, for $158,000.\" In September 2016, the \"Post\" reported that the grant was directly linked to the legal settlement, likely violating IRS self-dealing rules by using charitable funds to pay Trump's personal or business obligations. To raise the money needed to make the settlement, the Trump Foundation auctioned a prize of lifetime golf membership at Trump-owned golf courses, with the winning bid bringing a $157,000 donation to the Trump Foundation to the foundation to offset the payment to the Greenberg Foundation. The winner of the auction may have believed he was donating to Trump Foundation charitable causes.\n\nAccording to the Trump Foundation's publicly available tax returns, Trump National Golf Club Westchester paid over $200,000 to the Trump Foundation in 2016, with $158,000 of the funds designated as repayment of the foundation funds used toward the Martin B . Greenberg settlement.\n\nIn 2013, the Trump Foundation donated $25,000 in support of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's election campaign while Bondi's office was reviewing fraud allegations against Trump University, a for-profit real estate program created by Donald Trump. Around that time Trump also hosted a fundraiser for Bondi at his Mar-a-Lago resort at a fee well below his normal market rate. Bondi's office later ended the investigation without bringing charges.\n\nAccording to a Trump Foundation attorney, \"the [$25,000] contribution was made in error due to a case of mistaken identity of organizations with the same name.\" Trump later personally reimbursed his foundation for the $25,000. The foundation paid a $2,500 fine for violating IRS rules against political contributions by charitable organizations. In 2016 New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman stated publicly that the Trump Foundation was the subject of an ongoing investigation by his office.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a not-for-profit watchdog group, filed a complaint with the IRS (see below). It also cast doubt on Trump's story after obtaining a letter from the Trump Foundation's attorney to the New York Attorney General's office. \"We're past the point where a reasonable person could believe this is just a never-ending series of once in a lifetime errors,\" said CREW Communications Director Jordan Libowitz. \"This may not be anything nefarious, but if it isn't, that would mean that the Trump operation is completely inept when it comes to running the Trump Foundation.\"\n\nOn October 5, 2016, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported details of how Trump had on several other occasions since as early as the 1980s made campaign donations to various US state attorneys general while they had been reviewing cases involving the Trump Organization or Trump personally, although the Bondi case is the only one it cited as having involved Trump Foundation money.\n\nTrump paid $100,000 of Trump Foundation funds in 2012 to Reverend Franklin Graham's Billy Graham Evangelical Association. NBC News has called Graham \"an early ally\" of Trump. \"The more you listen to him, the more you say to yourself, 'You know, maybe the guy's right,'\" Graham had told ABC News in 2011. In October 2016 Graham revealed to the \"Charlotte Observer\" that, in 2012, he had instructed Trump to make the $100,000 donation and that the money was used to pay for full page ads urging voters to support candidates in the 2012 presidential election who supported \"biblical values\". The \"Observer\" has suggested the timing and tone of the ads indicate they were placed in support of Mitt Romney's campaign.\n\nGraham also heads Boone, North Carolina-based Samaritan's Purse, a Christian relief agency that received $25,000 from the Trump Foundation in 2012. Graham credits then-Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren for soliciting the $25,000 donation from Trump. Van Susteren and her TV crew had accompanied Graham on Samaritan's Purse trips to Haiti and North Korea. The \"Charlotte Observer\" quoted Graham saying \"[Trump] was on her show, and [Van Susteren] said, 'I was just in Haiti and Samaritan's Purse is doing this down there, and Donald, you need to help.' He sent a check out.\" In 2016, several media outlets alleged that Van Susteren had been producing overtly pro-Trump reports on her Fox News show \"On the Record\".\n\nIn 2014 the Trump Foundation made a $100,000 grant to the Citizens United Foundation, a charitable foundation closely related to David Bossie's conservative group, Citizens United. At the time Citizens United was engaged in a lawsuit against New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, whose office was pursuing a civil lawsuit against Trump University. It was the largest single grant made by the Trump Foundation that year. Schneiderman's office called the grant part of a \"vendetta\" by Trump, while Citizens United rejected any connection between the grant and its own lawsuit against Schneiderman. The Trump Foundation's 2014 tax filing misidentified Citizens United as a public charity (501(c)(3)) when it is in fact a social welfare organization (501(c)(4)).\n\nThe Trump Foundation donated a total of $40,000 from 2011 through 2013 to the Drumthwacket Foundation, a charitable organization formed to pay for renovation and historical preservation of the New Jersey governor's mansion of the same name. In 2011, Trump was seeking to acquire permits to build a personal cemetery on the fairway at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey and may have needed political help in obtaining approval for the permit.\n\nTrump directed $100,000 of Trump Foundation money toward the National September 11 Memorial Museum days before the 2016 New York State Republican presidential primary, where he was on the ballot, mischaracterizing the foundation grant as a personal donation.\n\nIn May 2015, the Trump Foundation granted $10,000 to Project Veritas, a charity run by conservative filmmaker James O'Keefe. In October 2016, O'Keefe released video which purportedly reveals how Democrats incited violence at Trump rallies. During the third 2016 presidential debate, Trump claimed that new videos produced by O'Keefe and released that week proved that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama had \"hired people\" and \"paid them $1,500\" to \"be violent, cause fights, [and] do bad things\" at Trump rallies. A Democratic National Committee spokesman noted Trump's donation after Project Veritas released another video on the 2016 presidential election. A Project Veritas spokesman responded by saying, \"We have a multi-million dollar budget and the cost of this video series alone is way up there. The donation Trump provided didn't impact our actions one way or the other.\"\n\nTrump may have strategically directed money from the Trump Foundation to support his presidential campaign. In one case, the grants were used specifically to pay for newspaper ads. In October 2016 \"RealClearPolitics\" reported that Trump directed significant amounts of foundation money to conservative organizations, possibly in return for political support and access. The news organization found that, from 2011 through 2014, Trump had \"harnessed his eponymous foundation to send at least $286,000 to influential conservative or policy groups... In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president.\" At least two of the groups are based in Republican-leaning early presidential primary states. In addition to Citizens United (above), groups include Iowa's The Family Leader, the South Carolina Palmetto Family Council, the American Conservative Union, and the American Spectator Foundation. Trump's granting of foundation money to these groups could have violated the law, if it was in return for his personal right to speak or gain access to networking events.\n\nIn 1989, the Trump Foundation paid more than half of a \"voluntary assessment\" imposed on the Plaza Hotel by the Central Park Conservancy. The hotel was owned by the Trump Organization at the time and the assessment was for the renovation of the severely dilapidated Pulitzer Fountain at Grand Army Plaza, which directly faced the hotel. Toward the $500,000 assessment, the foundation granted $264,631 to the Conservancy while the Trump Organization paid between $100,000 and $250,000. The grant to the Conservancy was the largest single grant made by the Trump Foundation from inception through at least 2015.\n\nOn two occasions, Trump used the Foundation's money to purchase artists' portraits of himself.\n\nIn 2012, Trump bid $12,000 at a charity auction, hosted at his Mar-a-lago club, to purchase an NFL football helmet autographed by Tim Tebow and a Tebow football jersey. Trump was given credit for generosity in newspaper accounts. However, the purchase was made with $12,000 of foundation money, not his own. The current whereabouts of the helmet and jersey are unknown. Tax law experts say if Trump kept them, the purchase might have violated the self-dealing rule, which bans private foundations from \"the furnishing of goods\" to their own officers.\n\nIn 2008 Trump used $107,000 of Trump Foundation funds to purchase a luxury trip to Paris, including a meeting with actress Salma Hayek, at a charity auction for the Gucci Foundation.\n\nIn 2013 the Trump Foundation made a $5,000 grant to the non-profit D.C. Preservation League. According to \"The Washington Post\", the nonprofit's support was helpful to the Trump Organization in obtaining the rights to convert Washington, D.C.'s historic Old Post Office Pavilion into the Trump International Hotel. In acknowledgment of the donation, the Trump Foundation received ads in the event programs; the ads promoted Trump's hotels rather than the foundation, in possible violation of IRS self-dealing rules.\n\n\"The Palm Beach Post\" has suggested that Trump benefited personally when the Trump Foundation made grants totaling $20,000 during 2012 through 2014 in return for band and choir performances held at his resorts.\n\nTrump may have directed income owed to him personally to be sent to the foundation instead, in possible violation of tax rules. \"The Washington Post\" reported in September 2016 that Donald Trump had directed that $2.3 million owed to him and his organization by various people and organizations should be paid instead to his foundation as donations, possibly evading personal income taxes. The \"Post\" found old \"Associated Press\" coverage showing that Trump may have started directing income to the Trump Foundation as early as 1989. IRS rules prohibit individuals from diverting taxable income owed to them toward charities if they benefit directly from those charities, unless the individual declares the income on his personal tax forms. Since Trump had yet to release his personal income taxes at that time, the \"Post\" was unable to confirm if the income was declared for any of the donations received.\n\nThe Trump Foundation received at least $1.9 million from ticket broker Richard Ebbers. Richard Ebers had bought goods and services, including tickets, from \"Trump or his businesses\"; he was allegedly instructed to make payment for them to the Trump Foundation in the form of charitable contributions instead of as income for the Trump organization.\n\nThe Trump Foundation received a total of $5,000,000 in donations from World Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon and his wife Linda McMahon from 2007 to 2009. Trump appeared twice in WrestleMania events, in 2007 and again in 2009. One donation to the foundation was $4 million in 2007; the second was $1 million in 2009. The WWE later told The Huffington Post that \"during this period of time, WWE paid Donald Trump appearance fees separately,\" and \"separately, [WWE chief executives] Vince and Linda McMahon made personal donations to Donald Trump's foundation.\"\n\nIn 2007, the Celebrity Fight Night Foundation hosted a fundraiser to benefit the Muhammad Ali Parkinson's Center in Phoenix, Arizona. According to a Celebrity Fight Night Foundation spokesperson, in return for Trump's appearance and his offering a New York-based dinner with himself at auction, Trump stipulated that the Parkinson's charity share the total auction proceeds with the Trump Foundation. The Trump Foundation subsequently received $150,000 of auction proceeds that would otherwise have gone to the center benefitting Parkinson's Disease research.\n\nOther donations made to the Trump Foundation that may have been in return for Trump's personal work include:\n\nTrump has been accused of directing foundation money toward several charities that in turn paid the Trump Organization to host charity events at Trump-owned hotels and golf clubs. High-profile charity events at Mar-a-Lago cost as much as $300,000.\n\nSome examples:\n\n\"The Washington Post\" and Fox News reported that Trump has repeatedly claimed in public, beginning in 2015, to have made over \"$102 million\" in charitable donations \"in the past five years\". The Trump Organization provided journalists with a 93-page list of the donations. None of the cash donations were confirmed to come from Trump himself; many were actually grants from the Trump Foundation, which no longer contained any of Trump's own money.\n\nFor example, Trump took personal credit and was honored for a Trump Foundation grant to the Palm Beach Police Foundation that was actually from an outside source (see above). He had pledged the money personally, and then the Trump Foundation solicited the $150,000 earmarked for the police foundation from an unrelated philanthropic organization, the Charles Evans Foundation. The Trump Foundation then paid the $150,000 to the Palm Beach charity. The police then honored Trump personally with its annual Palm Tree Award at Trump's Mar-a-Lago hotel at its annual fundraiser. \"The Washington Post\" wrote that \"Trump had effectively turned the Evans Foundation's gifts into his own gifts, without adding any money of his own.\"\n\nThe Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has honored Trump variously as \"Grand Benefactor\" and \"Grand Honorary Chair\" at its annual fundraisers held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump may have also earned more money on the event fees it received from the institute than the Trump Foundation paid to the institute in grants. Trump has directed at least $300,000 of grants of the Trump Foundation money to Dana-Farber since 2010.\n\nTrump received highly visible praise for his personal generosity on his prime-time television show \"The Apprentice\" on multiple occasions. Trump had frequently offered to make generous donations to his contestants' charities, but records show that he ultimately either directed the Trump Foundation to make a grant, or instead had the show's network, NBC Universal, make the donation instead. Examples include:\n\nOther alleged examples include:\n\nThe Trump Foundation is responsible by law for ensuring that any grant it makes to another private foundation is used strictly for charitable purposes. To fulfill this IRS \"expenditure responsibility\" the foundation is required to attach \"full and detailed\" reports describing the use of the grant money to its IRS 990 tax return for each year a grant to a private foundation is made. Trump Foundation tax returns show that it failed to do this for all of the 20 grants it made to private foundations during the period of 2005 through 2014. Such grants in this period, which total at least $488,500, could be subject to significant fines and penalties.\n\nIn 2015 Ukrainian Victor Pichkun made a $150,000 donation to the Trump Foundation in return for Trump's appearance by video conference link at the Yalta European Strategy Conference. The appearance was broadcast on a large screen and lasted only 20 minutes, including delays caused by translation and by technical difficulties. Pichkun is the son-in-law of former Ukrainian president Lionid Kuchma. In 2018 the \"New York Times\" reported that the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller was investigating the donation as a possible illegal in-kind campaign contribution from a foreign national intended to curry favor with then-candidate Trump.\n\nIn September and October 2016 there were several legal actions and complaints filed against the Trump Foundation. Former head of the Internal Revenue Service's Office of Exempt Organizations Division Marc Owens told \"The Washington Post\" regarding the various allegations against the foundation: \"This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues... It's the first time I've ever seen this, and I've been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total.\" \n\nIn late December 2016, one month before his inauguration, Trump announced that he would dissolve the Trump Foundation to avoid \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President\". However, a spokesperson from the New York State Attorney General's office told the \"New York Time\"s, the same month, that the foundation \"cannot legally dissolve\" until its current investigation is completed.\n\nOn September 13, 2016, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced that his office was investigating the foundation \"to make sure it's complying with the laws governing charities in New York.\" The office had previously filed charges—at that time awaiting trial—against the Trump Organization's Trump University. Jason Miller, a Trump campaign spokesman, responded to the announcement by labeling Schneiderman a \"partisan hack\". Schneiderman has endorsed Hillary Clinton and was identified as a member of her \"New York leadership council\" in October 2015.\n\nOn September 30, 2016, the Attorney General's office issued a \"Notice of Violation\" to the Trump Foundation, ordering it to immediately stop all fundraising in New York and to file its registration and all required past audits within 15 days, or risk being \"deemed to be a continuing fraud on the people of the State of New York\". Under the law, the foundation may eventually be required to return all donations it had solicited since inception. The notice said the foundation has not been in compliance with New York law because it had failed to re-register in New York State as a \"7A level charitable organization\", as required for charities that solicit $25,000 or more a year from outside donors. The Donald J. Trump Foundation had been registered in New York under the state's Estates, Powers and Trusts Law with a designation intended for self-funded private foundations.\n\nOn October 17 a spokesperson for the Attorney General's office confirmed that the Trump Foundation had agreed to cease solicitation of donations in New York State. The Trump Foundation was at the time granted an extension of time for filing its financial paperwork, including all past audits. The Attorney General's office said the Trump Foundation also agreed to cooperate with their ongoing investigation. The Attorney General's press secretary stated that Trump could not legally dissolve his foundation until the investigation is finished.\n\nIn filing its 2015 IRS Form 990 (filed in 2016 while under investigation by the New York State Attorney General's office), the foundation appears to admit that it had, in previous years, engaged in self-dealing and illegal transfers of funds to \"disqualified persons\". This admission contradicts its filings for previous years, where there is no admission of the same violations.\n\nOn June 14, 2018, the new New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a civil lawsuit against the foundation, Trump himself, and Trump's three adult children, Ivanka, Eric, and Donald Jr. alleging that they had engaged in \"extensive unlawful political conduct\" and that Donald Trump had been using the foundation \"as his personal checkbook,\" to, among other things, settle his personal legal debts and support his presidential campaign. The lawsuit sought $2.8 million in restitution and the dissolution of the Foundation. The suit noted that Trump himself made all decisions about disbursement of foundation funds and that the board of directors hadn't met for 18 years.. Underwood's office also referred suspected Federal campaign and tax law violations to the Federal Election Commission and to the IRS. \n\nSeparately, in July 2018, the case was referred to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. In August 2018, the department issued a subpoena to Michael Cohen, formerly Trump's personal attorney, in connection with the case.\n\nOn August 30, 2018, Trump attorney Alan Futerfas filed a motion to dismiss Underwood's suit, claiming it was without merit and was a result of \"pervasive bias\" by former New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman, who had supervised the investigation before resigning that May. On October 4, 2018, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a memorandum opposing the motion, instead strengthening the charges against the Trump Foundation and now alleging, among other claims, that the full $2.8 million of distributions resulting from the January 2016 Iowa fundraiser represented illegal campaign contributions that needed to be repaid. The memorandum also stated that the Foundation had engaged in \"persistent illegality,\" adding \"Donald J. Trump used his control over the Donald J. Trump Foundation for his benefit to advance his personal, business, and political interests in violation of federal and state law governing charities.\" \n\nOn October 25, Judge Saliann Scarpulla heard arguments for and against the motion to dismissed, but declined to issue a ruling at the time, stating she would await a pending decision by judges from the New York Supreme Court's Appellate Division (the separate Trump-related suit involving Summer Zervos) as to whether a sitting US president could be sued in state court at all. On November 23, Scarpulla ruled against the motion to dismiss, affirming that a sitting US president can face \"a civil lawsuit in state court for actions not taken in his official capacity\". \n\nOn April 9, 2018 the \"New York Times\" reported that the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of his larger investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election, was investigating the 2015 donation to the Trump Foundation of $150,000 by Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk. The \"Times\" reported that Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, had solicited the donation from Pinchuk in return for Trump's appearance in a 20-minute video conference with Pinchuk and others in Kiev in September 2015, just a few months after Mr Trump officially began his campaign for US President. The investigation was part of a broader investigation into foreign influence into the campaign. Federal election law prohibits non-US nationals from contributing to US political campaigns.\n\nAlso on September 13, 2016, all fifteen Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch requesting that the Justice Department launch a criminal investigation of Trump in connection with his foundation's $25,000 grant to Pam Bondi's campaign. The letter specifically cited possible violations of two anti-bribery laws.\n\nAlso on September 13, 2016, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a left-leaning watchdog group, filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service citing evidence they argued would compel the agency to seek back taxes and penalties and revoke the foundation's tax-free status. \n"}

His father died when he was 8 years old, his mother when he was 12, which forced him to withdraw from school and work to support his younger siblings. At the age of 14 he decided to go with his siblings to the southern village of Chincha, where he worked to many different trades. In 1915, he rented the Mencia farm in the Pisco Valley and became an agricultural entrepreneur. He undertook agricultural activities in nearly every valley on the country's central and southern coast, and re-invested the profits in other companies, from banking and financial entities to hotels, like the famous Hotel Paracas in Pisco, and real estate investments.\n\nIn 1954, the Peruvian economy was in crisis. Aware of the country's difficult situation, Guimoye did not hesitate to put his business aside and volunteered as Development Minister for the administration in office at the time, headed by Manuel A. Odría. By the end of the following year, he had performed very well in office. With a restored economy, and debts paid, he resigned his post. He only yearned to go back to his farming dream: the colonization of the northern Peruvian rainforest. Guimoye was adamant in the belief that the nation's rainforest offered significant economic and social opportunities, and that the nation's future lay in developing this potential. Therefore, instead of retiring, he decided to invest everything he owned in the colonization of Peru's northern rainforest. Guimoye settled in the Bagua area, where he dedicated himself to the cultivation of rice and cotton fields, as well as cattle breeding. However his hopes were frustrated by the Agrarian reform decreed by the left-wing dictatorship of Juan Velasco Alvarado in the 1970s, which paralyzed the initiative he had started.\n\nGuimoye died at the age of 97.\n\nNot too long after his death, the Peruvian postal service SERPOST, printed a limited edition collection stamp, in memoriam and recognition of who was one of the most important pioneers in agricultural property for the Republic of Peru.\n\nThe Republic of Peru, currently owes to Emilio Guimoye and family members, the amount of US $ 30'000,000.00 as an indemnification, product of the agricultural reform on which his lands were taken away.\n"}

{"id": "25846072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25846072", "title": "Health Impact Fund", "text": "Health Impact Fund\n\nThe Health Impact Fund (HIF) is a proposed pay-for-performance mechanism that would provide a market-based solution to problems concerning the development and distribution of medicines globally. It would incentivize the research and development of new pharmaceutical products that make substantial reductions in the global burden of disease. The HIF is the creation of a team of researchers led by the Yale philosopher Thomas Pogge and the University of Calgary economist Aidan Hollis, and is promoted by the non-profit organization Incentives for Global Health (IGH).\n\nIn the current system of development and distribution of medicines, millions of people in poor countries die from diseases because the patented medicines they need are unaffordable or because no medicine exists to cure their ailments. Little pharmaceutical research is concentrated on diseases specific to the poor. This is largely because it has been difficult for pharmaceutical companies to profit from research and development directed at products needed by the poor. The cost of pharmaceutical research and development is high and unlikely to be recovered from those in poor countries who cannot afford the medicines. Therefore, \"the Health Impact Fund would give companies incentives to develop new products targeting the diseases and conditions for which existing systems have failed to produce results, which would especially benefit the poor.\" \n\nThe distribution of pharmaceutical research and development is partly a result of the global patent regime established by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Prior to TRIPS, countries were free to not enact intellectual property laws covering medicines, leading to flourishing generic drug industries in countries such as India. Following TRIPS, all World Trade Organization members were required to institute strict, American-style intellectual property rights. As a result, the supply of generic medicines to poor countries has been sharply diminished. According to Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, the pharmaceutical patent system needs an \"alternative\" that would \"give large rewards for cures or vaccines for diseases like malaria that affect millions.\"\n\nThe HIF is intended to address the problems with an uncomplemented pharmaceutical patent system. The HIF uses market forces to create incentives to develop medicines for typically neglected diseases and to distribute these medicines at low prices all over the world. Pharmaceutical patent-holders would receive financial rewards by opting to register their new medicines, or new uses of existing medicines, with the Fund. By registering, a patent-holder agrees to distribute its medicine globally at cost and to cooperate in measuring the health impact of that medicine. In return, the firm receives an annual reward based on its measurable contribution to reducing the global burden of disease.\n\nRegistrants of new drugs are eligible for reward payments for ten years starting at the date of marketing approval of their product. New uses receive rewards for five years. Following the reward period, registrants agree to allow generic manufacturing of their medicines, in order to prevent price spikes. Registrants retain their rights to control follow-on innovation.\n\nWhen assessing the health impact of a registered product, “the HIF would essentially estimate the difference between (1) the actual health status of people who consumed the registered product and (2) the estimated health status of those people, had they not had access to the registered product.”\n\nThe standard measure of health impact is the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). For example, if all registered products were in conjunction estimated to have saved 10 million QALYs, then a registered product that saved 1 million of those QALYS would receive ten percent of the available reward funds for that year. The health impact assessment of a registered product would be conducted for each year of its registration with the HIF, and payments would be disbursed annually.\n\nThe HIF is to be financed by governments. Ideally, countries will commit a fixed amount of their gross national income (GNI) to the HIF (0.03 percent of a country’s GNI is the suggested minimum).\n\nAs performance measurement is a core component of the HIF, it needs to be robust across different products and in diverse settings. Working with leading health care assessment organizations such as The George Institute for International Health, NICE International, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, IGH will perform evaluations of the health impact of different products in a variety of countries. The HIF would expand assessment beyond pre-approval clinical trials, using epidemiological data from actual usage, practical trials, physician surveys, and patient demographics, as modifiers to the core health impact assessment. IGH aims to pilot the proposed HIF mechanism by rewarding a pharmaceutical manufacturer on the basis of measured health impact in a region. This will allow the pay-for-performance approach to be field-tested and refined before it is implemented on a wider scale.\n\nOutcomes and Benefits of the Pilot:\n(1.) Create a comprehensive metric to evaluate the health impact of medicines based on the actual reductions in mortality and morbidity each achieves.\n(2.) Determine how to apply this metric reliably through a field-test that focuses on a new drug’s introduction into a specific area. No attempt has ever been made to measure the health impact of a newly introduced medicine.\n(3.) Benefit people in the field-test area by giving them access to an important new product at an affordable price and by rewarding the innovator promoting its wide and effective use by those who can benefit from it.\n\nIGH is currently exploring opportunities for potential pilots.\n\nThe HIF can be seen as a kind of comprehensive Advanced Market Commitment, since it essentially is a way of incentivizing new research while ensuring access at low prices. However, compared to the Advanced Market Commitment, it is comprehensive because it could apply to any drug or vaccine, and it would operate in all countries. Alternatively, one can put it in the context of prizes, since it has prize-like characteristics in terms of incentivizing research while not enabling high prices. A third way of viewing it is as a supplementary global drug insurance system, in which the copayment made by consumers is equal to the cost of production.\n\nThe HIF staff has prepared a memo setting out their view of the intellectual history of the HIF.\n\nWhen the HIF was proposed in 2008, it attracted criticism from Professor Brook Baker and Knowledge Ecology International for not requiring open licensing of registered drugs. Instead, it allowed drug manufacturers to maintain a monopoly, subject to regulated prices. The proponents modified the proposal in response, suggesting greater flexibility about this aspect of the HIF, but this remains a controversial feature of the proposal, when compared to other prize fund proposals that feature open licensing of patents to generic manufacturers.\n\nBrita Pekarsky (2010) has argued that the cost of the HIF may be too high, if it is taking money away from other valuable development aid or health related activities.\n\nPaul Grootendorst (2009) states that the primary drawback of the HIF is the difficulty of measuring health impact accurately. He notes particularly the problems of trying to attribute health impact to drugs that have long latency periods in their effectiveness (such as vaccines and anti-hypertensives); the problems of consistency across different therapeutic areas; and the technical difficulty of disentangling the effect of the drug from confounding factors.\n\nJorn Sonderholm (2009) argues that there is a lack of evidence that patents create a barrier to access, so that the HIF may fail to address a real problem.\n\nSakiko Fukuda-Parr and Proochista Ariana (2011) criticized the HIF on a variety of grounds, including its approach to the distribution of benefits and costs, the impact on generic competition and the role of the HIF in strategic negotiations on intellectual property rights, leading to a response from IGH.\n\nAfschin Gandjour and Nadja Chernyak state that the HIF does not have a rational basis for the underlying willingness to pay per health gain and, instead, uses an arbitrary figure such as 0.03% of the GNI. Furthermore, the HIF assumes an arbitrary duration of reward (e.g., 10 years) and does not adjust health gains for equity concerns and uncertainty.\n\nThe Health Impact Fund is supported by a distinguished Advisory Board.\n\n\nIn June 2010, the Social Democratic Party of Germany officially endorsed the HIF and called on the German government to actively support a HIF pilot.\n\nThe World Health Organization Expert Working Group on Research and Development Financing (related to Public health, innovation and intellectual property) described the HIF as one of a few \"promising\" proposals deserving further examination. A new WHO Consultative Expert Working Group (CEWG) has noted that the HIF proposal would benefit from a pilot to demonstrate feasibility.\n\nCarl Nathan (2009) suggests that the HIF could help to overcome obstacles to the control of tuberculosis such as development and distribution of vaccines and medicines to the poor.\n\nJohn J. DeGioia, President of Georgetown University, has complimented the HIF for bringing moral imperatives and pragmatic market principles together. He states, \"that this is the beauty of the Health Impact Fund . . . it translates idealism into innovation.\"\n\nChristian Barry and Matt Peterson favour the HIF as a mechanism for providing innovators with incentives to develop new medicines that have significant health impacts rather than significant sales impacts.\n\nJames Orbinski states that the HIF is an innovative policy proposal that \"should be implemented.\"\n\n\n"}

Hudson Building (\"Hudson's\") was a department store located at 1206 Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit, Michigan. It was constructed beginning in 1911, with additions throughout the years, before being \"completed\" in 1946, and named after the company's founder, Joseph Lowthian Hudson. Hudson's first building on the site opened in 1891 but was demolished in 1923 for a new structure. It was the flagship store for the Hudson's chain. The building was demolished in a controlled demolition on October 24, 1998, with many people watching from Hart Plaza (Detroit) and Dieppe Gardens (Windsor, Ontario). It was the tallest building ever imploded.\n\nDesigned by Smith, Hinchman, & Grylls, Hudson's consisted of approximately 33 levels: five basements, main floor, mezzanine, 2nd through 15th floors, 15 1/2 floor, 16th through 21st floors, 21 1/2 floor, and 22nd through 25th floors. Only the upper two basements through the 12th floor covered the entire footprint of the structure. A tower rose over 400 feet above the Farmer Street side. On all four sides, porcelain-covered copper letters spelled \"HUDSON'S\" in red neon.\nHudson's boasted about 2.2 million sq. ft. of retail and office space, included several restaurants and was built in the Chicago School architectural style. The facade was red brick above the second floor. Below that, it consisted of polished pink granite panels. Terra-cotta cornices and rosettes were extensively employed, along with ornamental ironwork. \"JLH\"-emblazoned ovals decorated frosted windows on the mezzanine and 3rd through 5th floors.\n\nThe building measured tall from its second basement to the top of the penthouse tower. It was also topped by a high flagpole.\n\nThe store closed January 17, 1983 (at the nadir of downtown Detroit's decline).\n\nAfter closure, Hudson's maintained its headquarters staff of about 1,100 in the downtown store. In May 1984, The J.L. Hudson Co. formally merged into the Department Store Division of the Dayton Hudson Corp., although Hudson's stores continued to carry the Hudson's name. All executive and buying positions transferred to Minneapolis, and other staff moved to space at the Northland Center store in Southfield. The last corporate department in the downtown Detroit building, credit operations, moved in October 1986. Dayton Hudson sold the building in December 1989.\n\nHudson's was demolished by Controlled Demolition, Inc. at exactly 5:47 pm EST on October 24, 1998. 20,000 people watched as the building was imploded — turning it into a tall pile of debris. The demolition shattered windows on many then-still-abandoned retail buildings across Woodward Avenue, created a large debris and dust cloud that shrouded many parts of downtown Detroit as far south as Jefferson Avenue in dust (including thousands of people and vehicles) and accidentally damaged a section of the elevated Detroit People Mover.\n\nThe city constructed a 955-spot, four-level Underground parking garage at the site using parts of the basement of the demolished tower in 2001.\n\nIn November 2013, Bedrock Detroit, who would be granted development rights of the two-acre city-owned site, hired New York-based SHoP Architects and Detroit-based Hamilton Anderson Associates to lead the design process of redevelopment on the site. Bedrock broke ground on the development on December 14, 2017; the plans include a tower of 62 stories and and a mid-rise building of 14 stories. The project is expected to open in 2022.\n\n\n"}

Renamed Banco Andino, it became one of the most efficient banks in the Colombian banking system within four years. The Gilinski Group sold the reconstituted bank for a reported $70 million.\n\nThe family then moved to purchase Banco de Colombia for $365 million, in what was then the largest privatization in Colombia's history. A group of premier private equity investors led by Morgan Stanley Asset Management investing $65 million, billionaire George Soros investing $50 million and Tiger Asset Management with $35 million together with more than 100 other European and North American institutional investors co-invested with Gilinski. Later, the family sold control of the bank to Banco Industrial Colombiano, and its controlling stakeholder Sindicato Antioqueño, in a deal valued at $800 million, among Colombia's largest deals. Gilinski received $418 million for its stake and retained a minority position in the new bank as part of the deal. As of 2018, Bancolombia was the largest in Colombia with a market capitalization of $11 billion on the NYSE.\n\nIn 2003, Gilinski acquired and subsequently merged Banco Sudameris and Banco Tequendema. This merger created GNB Sudameris, a bank with assets of over US $10 billion that ranks among the largest private Colombian banks as of 2018. The purchase of Servibanca, an ATM network with over 2,600 machines, and Suma Valores, a stock exchange commission agent company, has further expanded the network.\n\nIn May 2012, HSBC announced the sale of its Latin American operations (Colombia, Peru, Paraguay) to Banco GNB Sudameris for $400 million in cash. \n\nIn September 2013, Banco Sabadell announced that Gilinski became its largest shareholder as the anchor investor in a US $1.8 billion capital raise. Through the ABB and share rights issue, Gilinski's investment totals approximately $500 million. Banco Sabadell is the 5th largest bank in Spain, with over US $220 billion in assets and a 13% market share.\n\nThe Gilinski group also owns Yupi, a snack food company in Latin America, and exports to nine countries. Gilinski Group also owns Rimax Plastics, which was founded by his father Isaac Gilinski.\n\nIn partnership with London & Regional Properties, Gilinski is developing the Panama Pacifico business and residential development in Panama City, Panama. Jaime Gilinski and his partners Ian and Richard Livingstone beat 16 other international firms in a competition to develop the project. The $10 billion project, based on the former Howard Air Force Base in Panama, includes of land, which makes it one of the largest development projects in the world.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Gilinskis contributed US$8 million to the Fundacion Santa Fe. This was during Jaime Gilinski's time as chairman of Banco de Colombia. La Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá supports Santa Fe Hospital in Bogotá. Founded in 1972, this hospital is recognized as Colombia’s most technologically advanced.\n\nGilinski is the chair of Capital Projects for The Chabad House at Harvard University. The Chabad House at Harvard is a Jewish student organization that provides educational, social, and recreational programming for students and faculty.

{"id": "21773018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21773018", "title": "Jaime Yankelevich", "text": "Jaime Yankelevich\n\nJaime Yankelevich (1896 — 1952) was an Argentine engineer and businessman who was a pioneer in the development of his country's radio and television media.\n\nJaime Yankelevich was born into a Jewish family in Bulgaria, in 1896. His parents emigrated to Argentina in 1899 and settled in the province of Entre Ríos. The Yankelevich family relocated to Buenos Aires in 1914, where Jaime found work in one of the city's many theatres as a backstage hand. Trained as a theatre electrician, Yankelevich eventually opened an electrical supply store in the Constitución section of Buenos Aires. The store specialized in radio valves and other equipment, which became in great demand following the advent of the medium in 1920. Increasingly skilled in his field, he created many of these parts by hand.\n\nThe sale of a failing early radio station gave Yankelevich the opportunity to pursue his interest directly and in 1924, he purchased the ailing broadcaster. Known at the time as \"LR3\" (for its being the third station on the dial), Yankelevich pioneered the use of artistic contracts in radio, by which artists were paid a salary in return for his commitment to limit broadcasts of their work to live performances in lieu of recordings. The practice made the newly christened \"Radio Belgrano\" the most coveted employer in Argentine radio and by the 1930s, it enjoyed the nation's highest ratings. Growing acquisitions allowed Yankelevich to form the Radio Belgrano chain in 1937. Venturing into other areas, he co-produced \"Two Friends and One Love\", a 1937 romantic comedy film, with Francisco Canaro, a well-known Argentine tango bandleader. Later that decade, he pioneered late-night broadcasting in Argentina, and in 1942, united numerous low-wattage radio stations into the Argentine Broadcasting Chain, which preserved or reopened a number of smaller, local stations nationwide.\n\nThe 1946 election of President Juan Perón resulted in the nationalization of industries producing nearly half the nation's goods and services, including the three radio networks that controlled most of Argentina's stations, \"El Mundo\", \"Splendid\" and \"Belgrano\".\n\nYankelevich had opposed the 1943 coup d'état, and the advent of one of its most recognizable figures (Perón) to the Presidency antagonized the impresario. Allowing critical commentary of Perón's inaugural address following the event, Radio Belgrano was suspended by government order for one month. The experience persuaded Yankelevich to sell Radio Belgrano to the state for US$1.5 million in 1947. The chain's management was left to Yankelevich, who continued to receive the greater part of the chain's net income (Argentine radio's most profitable), and in turn, the Perón regime dictated content and vetted personnel and performers.\n\nA personal tragedy motivated Yankelevich to pioneer another, then-inexistent medium in Argentina. The death in 1949 of his son Miguel, who professed fascination with the growth of television in the United States, led the grieving father to purchase the necessary equipment for its introduction in Argentina. Discussing the authorization for the project with Perón's Communications Minister, Oscar Nicolini, Yankelevich persuaded the reluctant bureaucrat by positing that: \n\n\"The money needed to invest in this project does not concern me, for no amount of millions would be too much!\" \nImporting DuMont television cameras and ITT transmitters, he and engineers James Ballantine, Máximo Koeble and Alejandro Spataro prepared the downtown studio and installed a antenna over the 23-story Ministry of Public Works (then Buenos Aires' second-tallest building). Personally operating the antenna, Yankelevich and his team achieved the nation's first television broadcast in 1951, reaching 40 blocks around. Emitting programs through the only TV station in Argentina at the time (Channel 7), all programming on the station was produced by \"Radio Belgrano Televisión\", providing Yankelevich a similarly profitable relationship with the state as the one his radio chain had enjoyed since 1947.\n\nYankelevich's failing health led to his hospitalization a few months later, and he died in 1952 at the age of 56. Among the items in his hospital room, was a television set.\n"}

Raising the BDT 10 lakh (US$37,500 in 1984) initial capital for what is now known as the Envoy Group proved difficult. In the end, Ahmed took out a bank loan with his father's house as collateral and brought in a partner, Abdus Salam Murshedy, a striker for Mohammedan Sporting Club who had gained fame in 1982 by scoring a league-record 27 goals, but who had no previous business experience.\n\nIn 1984, the partners set up a small factory in the Khilgaon Thana area of Dhaka, equipped it with 46 sewing machines, and hired 200 garment workers. Initially the company sub-contracted for other garment manufacturers. They were early participants in a sector that would become a powerhouse of the Bangladesh economy, but orders were sporadic at first, and the factory was idle for long spells. Sometimes they had to borrow from banks to meet payroll. The turning point came when they received their first order as a primary contractor, 6,500 trousers for a Swedish retailer.\n\nThe agent who placed the order was impressed with their work and directed more business their way. In the next 16 months, Envoy Group recorded a BDT 1 crore (US$385,000 in 1985) profit. They paid off their debt and bought two more garment factories, building on the experience gained running their first.\n\nThrough expansion, by attracting investment and purchasing existing businesses, Ahmed led the company as it grew over the years into a large manufacturing and exporting group.\n\nAhmed completed a term as President in Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), Dhaka and Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers & Exporters Association (BGMEA) in 2001 and 2002.\n\nHe received the \"Arthakantha Business Award-2002\" by a national financial fortnightly of Bangladesh.

Later versions were designed to work in Windows 3.1, at which point it was succeeded by FormFlow. \n\nThe initial version of PerForm was created in 1988 and was the first product released by Canadian software firm Delrina, which became best known for its later fax software program, WinFax. Chief Technical Officer Bert Amato and President of the company Mark Skapinker came up with the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper-based forms from a computer. The program consisted of two parts: a form design module which gave users a graphical user interface for creating and arranging form elements, using tools largely familiar to those using desktop publishing or paint programs of the era, and a separate form filling program which would display the resulting form that the user could then fill in. Those entering information into the forms could not change or alter the forms; they were limited to adding information in the various form fields on screen. Some of the potential uses of the program included being able to create invoices, payment records, personnel and payroll forms, and just about any other standardized form that may have been required. Later versions of the program had some integration with Delrina's popular WinFax program, enabling users to fax material to clients based on information entered into PerForm. \n\nThere was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada and the United States, the latter spurred on in particular by the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the total amount of paperwork handled by the United States government. One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990. Soon after the software was installed on Compaq laptops that accompanied U.S. troops during the First Gulf War, where it was used to requisition \"everything from Coca-Cola to privies\". Other significant volume sales went to 3M and Rockwell International. What helped set apart Delrina's electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy-to-use interface, its extensive development tools, and its comparatively low price. It also scored highly when it came to workflow and routing functions as well as security features. In early 1991 InfoWorld selected PerForm Pro\nas its \"Product of the Year\" in the electronic forms\ncategory, and PC World Magazine gave the product it's \"Best Buy\" designation. PerForm proved to be successful in its niche, effectively capturing the retail market by 1993.\n\nThe electronic forms division of Delrina was sold to JetForm in 1996. JetForm in turn was bought by Adobe, and the electronic forms products were officially discontinued in 2004.\n\n"}

{"id": "3012034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3012034", "title": "Railroad Tycoon II", "text": "Railroad Tycoon II\n\nRailroad Tycoon II is a train and business simulation video game for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, PlayStation and Dreamcast in the \"Railroad Tycoon\" series. The Dreamcast version is a Gold Edition with improved graphics and gameplay. \"Railroad Tycoon II: Gold Edition\" was ported to Linux by Loki Software.\n\nGameplay is displayed in dimetric view, unlike the top-down view of \"Railroad Tycoon\".\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon II\" is a railroad simulation that covers the entire history of railroads from inception to the present day and beyond. The player chooses a map and assumes the role of chairman of a railroad company. The player tries to make profits for investors and completes various other objectives while being hindered by rivals, random events such as train breakdowns, train robbers, economic swings, and scripted events particular to the scenario.\n\nMost of the gameplay consists of building tracks, stations and trains, which are used for hauling passengers and freight from one station to another. Delivery revenue can vary by time, distance, demand, cargo type, economic state, station improvements and difficulty level. Companies can connect to and use each other's track and stations, so revenue can be split. Expenses include the fuel, track and engine maintenance and management fee. The fuel cost depends on the cargo weight and the distance each engine runs. Engine maintenance depends on engine age and the engine's type (some locomotives cost more to maintain than others). The elder engines cost more to keep them on the line. The track maintenance is solely calculated from track mileage.\n\nThe player will determine what kind of cargo(es) to put on/off at each station that the player adds to its routing. Way-points may also be inserted to override default track selection where multiple paths are possible.\n\nThere are many industries in the game, and each can produce and/or convert specific cargoes. For example, coal mines produce coal, iron mines produce iron, and, in the advanced game, a steel mill can convert 1 load of iron plus 1 load of coal into 2 loads of steel. The players are encouraged to find a chain of production to make new cargo by hauling the right type of cargo to each step of the industries. By doing this right, the player can haul raw materials one way, \"create\" manufactured return cargo, and make even more money hauling finished products back the other way.\n\nOne of the key elements of game play relates to the player purchasing and operating a variety of locomotives, each of which possesses different attributes relating to speed, fuel type, preferred cargo, and the ability to traverse hills and steep track grades. In general, the player should balance the cost of operating a train and the time required to transport cargo, with the balance being that the profit from cargo delivery outweighs train operating costs. The player also may purchase various industrial plants to earn extra money based on amount of cargo received and delivered. Basic industry, such as bakeries, textile mills, and tool and die factories, earns less profit than advanced factories such as canneries, steel mills and automobile plants, although the latter require multiple goods delivered to produce one final product. Furthermore, idle industries which do not produce goods will generate a negative profit, thus increasing overall operating costs and overhead.\n\nThe following locomotives are available for game play. Locomotives are only seen in specific time periods and scenarios. In addition to the attributes described above, locomotives are subject to \"mechanical reliability\", which is a randomly generated factor influencing how often a locomotive will break down. All locomotives begin their operational lives with a set chance of mechanical failure, with some types more prone to breakdowns than others. Breakdown percentage chance increases the older a locomotive becomes. A train may also suffer a wreck, which completely destroys the locomotive and all hauled cargo.\n\nThe game also features one futuristic train, the \"Mag-Lev TBX-1\" which is portrayed as released in the (then) future date of 2008. The train operates using Maglev technology which, as of 2015, has been prototyped in both Europe and Japan. The first successful Maglev train to be operated was the SCMaglev with speeds approaching 400 miles per hour.\n\nGameplay also includes financial manipulation of companies, issuing bonds, share repurchases, stock issues, manipulating dividends, merging with other companies and declaring bankruptcy. These features are required in some scenarios and may be used for either great financial gain or total fiscal disaster.\n\nIn normal financial mode, the player may buy or sell any companies' stocks at various prices depending upon the economy. On advanced settings, the broker may allow the player to buy on margin or short sell stocks if he has enough value of stocks or cash to rely on. The computer players may also engage in these practices and will attempt to bankrupt the player when he is heavily in debt.\n\nThe economy may fluctuate during gameplay, with five economic states possible: Booming, Prosperity, Normal, Recession and Depression. When the economy is good, the revenue of hauled goods and stock prices will be higher. Bond interest rates will also be adjusted with the economy level, including the interest received from cash and the interest paid for the bonds.\n\nThe original game features eighteen missions, divided between North America, Europe and the rest of the world. The missions can be played on three difficulty levels, and each also includes three listed objectives. Completing only the first objective awards the player a bronze medal, the first two a silver medal, and all three a gold medal. The player may play any mission in each set as many times as they wish; they may also continue even though a mission has been failed. The final score for the whole 18 mission campaign is calculated by the difficulty level and the number of each type of medal achieved.\n\nIn addition to the campaign, \"Railroad Tycoon II\" features many single scenarios. As with the campaign, each scenario is based on a geographical location, which may be fictional. Most scenarios also have a medal system similar to that of the campaign, although any scenario may be played in sandbox mode as well. Many scenarios constrain the player to some specific point on the timeline and feature scripted events: for example, the Korean map presents an alternative history as the player is informed about the averted Korean civil war.\n\nAdditional single scenarios may be created using the map editor included. Maps may be imported, drawn from scratch, or edited from existing maps and saved under new names. Many fan creations have been shared on various fan sites.\n\nIn late 1997, Bruce Shelley said of his chance of developing \"Railroad Tycoon II\", \"I would be happy to work on such a game but there are real doubts about its ability to generate sufficient sales in this blockbuster market where a few of the games make most of the money.\"\n\nThe soundtrack of \"Railroad Tycoon II\" consist mostly of classical \"railroad\" blues and bluegrass genre from the era the game revolves around. These pieces were not, unlike most contemporary games, midi files, but rather high quality studio recordings; some even with vocals. This fact has contributed to the solid ratings this game has received.\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon 2: Gold\" is a collection of \"Railroad Tycoon 2\" and \"Railroad Tycoon 2: The Second Century\", in one package. \"Railroad Tycoon 2: Platinum\" is equivalent to the \"Gold Edition\" plus over 50 community-made maps added and enhanced mouse-wheel support. Maps (scenarios) developed specifically for the platinum edition may not function in some earlier versions. The last official patch to \"Railroad Tycoon 2\" was platinum v1.56 on February 19, 2003.\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon II\" was a commercial success. Its sales surpassed 500,000 copies globally by February 1999, and its computer version alone sold more than 1.5 million copies by August 2001. In the United States, the game and its \"Gold\" edition together sold 351,000 copies by October 2001. According to Franz J. Felsl of PopTop, much of \"Railroad Tycoon II\"s success came from European markets; he explained that it \"did better in Europe than it did in the US, which is not the way things usually end up.\"\n\nBy August 2000, \"Railroad Tycoon II\" had been released in 39 unique SKUs worldwide, including eight Windows versions in English alone. PopTop's Phil Steinmeyer wrote that roughly 33% of the game's sales derived from the \"Gold\" edition and \"Second Century\" expansion, and that the port for Macintosh \"sold respectably\", while the PlayStation version was unsuccessful. He accredited the game's number of versions with its commercial success, and wrote in August 2000, \"Overall, had we only released the original game, in English, for Windows only, our sales would be less than a quarter of what they are now.\" In 2003, Steinmeyer remarked that \"Railroad Tycoon II\" continued to sell \"pretty well\".\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon II\" won \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\"s and CNET Gamecenter's 1998 \"Strategy Game of the Year\" awards; the former magazine's editors wrote that it \"capture[d] almost all of the things gamers had come to love about the original.\" It also received IGN's \"Best Soundtrack\" award.\n\nThe game was a finalist for \"Computer Gaming World\"s 1998 \"Best Strategy\", GameSpot's \"Strategy Game of the Year\", IGN's \"Best Strategy Game of the Year\" and \"PC Gamer US\"s \"The Best Real-Time Strategy Game\" awards, all of which ultimately went to \"StarCraft\". \"Computer Gaming World\"s editors lauded \"Railroad Tycoon II\" as \"a brilliant update of a gaming classic\", and the staff of \"PC Gamer US\" wrote that the game \"did a terrific job of immersing the player in a richly detailed world of empire-building, commerce and micro-management.\"\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon II\" became the first game published by Gathering of Developers to sell 1 million copies, and Geoff Keighley of \"Computer Gaming World\" declared it one of the publisher's few \"certified hits.\" In the United States, the publisher's combined lifetime sales reached 1.3 million copies by October 2001, including the sales of \"Railroad Tycoon II\". Gathering of Developers president Mike Wilson believed that the game put his company on the map, at a time when others in the computer game industry doubted that an independent publisher could succeed.\n\nIt was featured in G4 Icons' episode 12 Sid Meier as part of Sid's history with games and computers.\n"}

The term is used by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The TDRA is used to determine the scope and required evidence to support management's testing of its internal controls under SOX404. It is also used by the external auditor to issue a formal opinion on the company's internal controls. However, as a result of the passage of Auditing Standard No. 5, which the SEC has since approved, external auditors are no longer required to provide an opinion on management's assessment of its own internal controls.\n\nDetailed guidance about performing the TDRA is included with PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5 (Release 2007-005 \"An audit of internal control over financial reporting that is integrated with an audit of financial statements\") and the SEC's interpretive guidance (Release 33-8810/34-55929) \"Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\". This guidance is applicable for 2007 assessments for companies with 12/31 fiscal year-ends. The PCAOB release superseded the existing PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 2, while the SEC guidance is the first detailed guidance for management specifically. PCAOB reorganized the auditing standards as of December 31, 2017, with the relevant SOX guidance now included under AS2201: \"An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That is Integrated with An Audit of Financial Statements\".\n\nThe language used by the SEC chairman in announcing the new guidance was very direct: \"Congress never intended that the 404 process should become inflexible, burdensome, and wasteful. The objective of Section 404 is to provide meaningful disclosure to investors about the effectiveness of a company's internal controls systems, without creating unnecessary compliance burdens or wasting shareholder resources.\" Based on the 2007 guidance, SEC and PCAOB directed a significant reduction in costs associated with SOX 404 compliance, by focusing efforts on higher-risk areas and reducing efforts in lower-risk areas.\n\nTDRA is a hierarchical framework that involves applying specific risk factors to determine the scope and evidence required in the assessment of internal control. Both the PCAOB and SEC guidance contain similar frameworks. At each step, qualitative or quantitative risk factors are used to focus the scope of the SOX404 assessment effort and determine the evidence required. Key steps include:\nManagement is required to document how it has interpreted and applied its TDRA to arrive at the scope of controls tested. In addition, the sufficiency of evidence required (i.e., the timing, nature, and extent of control testing) is based upon management (and the auditor's) TDRA. As such, TDRA has significant compliance cost implications for SOX404.\n\nThe guidance is principles-based, providing significant flexibility in the TDRA approach. There are two major steps: 1) Determining the scope of controls to include in testing; and 2) Determining the nature, timing and extent of testing procedures to perform.\n\nThe key SEC principle related to establishing the scope of controls for testing may be stated as follows: \"Focus on controls that adequately address the risk of material misstatement.\" This involves the following steps:\n\nUnder the PCAOB AS 5 guidance, the auditor is required to determine whether an account is \"significant\" or not (i.e., yes or no), based on a series of risk factors related to the likelihood of financial statement error and magnitude (dollar value) of the account. Significant accounts and disclosures are in-scope for assessment, so management typically includes this information in its documentation and generally performs this analysis for review by the auditor. This documentation may be referred to in practice as the \"significant account analysis.\" Accounts with large balances are generally presumed to be significant (i.e., in-scope) and require some type of testing.\n\nNew under the SEC guidance is the concept of also rating each significant account for \"misstatement risk\" (low, medium, or high), based on similar factors used to determine significance. The misstatement risk ranking is a key factor used to determine the nature, timing, and extent of evidence to be obtained. As risk increases, the expected sufficiency of testing evidence accumulated for controls related to significant accounts increases (see section below regarding testing & evidence decisions).\n\nBoth significance and misstatement risk are inherent risk concepts, meaning that conclusions regarding which accounts are in-scope are determined before considering the effectiveness of controls.\n\nObjectives help set the context and boundaries in which risk assessment occurs. The COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework, a standard of internal control widely used for SOX compliance, states: \"A precondition to risk assessment is the establishment of objectives...\" and \"Risk assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant risks to achievement of the objectives.\" The SOX guidance states several hierarchical levels at which risk assessment may occur, such as entity, account, assertion, process, and transaction class. Objectives, risks, and controls may be analyzed at each of these levels. The concept of a top-down risk assessment means considering the higher-levels of the framework first, to filter from consideration as much of the lower-level assessment activity as possible.\n\nThere are many approaches to top-down risk assessment. Management may explicitly document control objectives, or use texts and other references to ensure their risk statement and control statement documentation is complete. There are two primary levels at which objectives (and also controls) are defined: \"entity-level\" and \"assertion level\".\n\nAn example of an \"entity-level\" control objective is: \"Employees are aware of the Company's Code of Conduct.\" The COSO 1992/1994 Framework defines each of the five components of internal control (i.e., Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Information & Communication, Monitoring, and Control Activities). Evaluation suggestions are included at the end of key COSO chapters and in the \"Evaluation Tools\" volume; these can be modified into objective statements.\n\nAn example of an \"assertion-level\" control objective is \"Revenue is recognized only upon the delivery of products and services.\" Lists of assertion-level control objectives are available in most financial auditing textbooks. Excellent examples are also available in AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 110 (SAS 110) for the inventory process. SAS 106 includes the latest guidance on financial statement assertions.\n\nControl objectives may be organized within processes, to help organize the documentation, ownership and TDRA approach. Typical financial processes include expense & accounts payable (purchase to payment), payroll, revenue and accounts receivable (order to cash collection), capital assets, etc. This is how most auditing textbooks organize control objectives. Processes can also be risk-ranked.\n\nCOSO issued revised guidance in 2013 effective for companies with year-end dates after December 15, 2014. This essentially requires control statements to be referenced to 17 \"principles\" beneath the five COSO \"components.\" There are approximately 80 \"points of focus\" that can be evaluated specifically against the controls of the company, to form a conclusion about the 17 principles (i.e., each principle has several relevant points of focus). Most of the principles and points of focus relate to entity-level controls. As of June 2013 the approaches used in practice were in the early stages of development. One approach would be to add the principles and points of focus as criteria within a database and reference each to the relevant controls that address them.\n\nOne definition of risk is anything that can interfere with the achievement of an objective. A risk statement is an expression of \"what can go wrong.\" Under the 2007 guidance (i.e., SEC interpretive guidance and PCAOB AS5), those risks that inherently have a \"reasonably possible\" likelihood of causing a material error in the account balance or disclosure are the material misstatement risks (\"MMR\"). Note that this is a slight amendment to the \"more than remote\" likelihood language of PCAOB AS2, intended to limit the scope to fewer, more critical material risks and related controls.\n\nAn example of a risk statement corresponding to the above assertion level control objective might be: \"The risk that revenue is recognized \"before\" the delivery of products and services.\" Note that this reads very similarly to the control objective, only stated in the negative.\n\nManagement develops a listing of MMR, linked to the specific accounts and/or control objectives developed above. MMR may be identified by asking the question: \"What can go wrong related to the account, assertion or objective?\" MMR may arise within the accounting function (e.g., regarding estimates, judgments, and policy decisions) or the internal and external environment (e.g., corporate departments that feed the accounting department information, economic and stock market variables, etc.) Communication interfaces, changes (people, process or systems), fraud vulnerability, management override of controls, incentive structure, complex transactions, and degree of judgment or human intervention involved in processing are other high-risk topics.\n\nIn general, management considers questions such as: What is really difficult to get right? What accounting problems have we had in the past? What has changed? Who might be capable or motivated to commit fraud or fraudulent financial reporting? As a high percentage of financial frauds historically have involved the overstatement of revenue, such accounts typically merit additional attention. AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 109 (SAS 109) also provides helpful guidance regarding financial risk assessment.\n\nUnder the 2007 guidance, companies are required to perform a fraud risk assessment and assess related controls. This typically involves identifying scenarios in which theft or loss could occur and determining if existing control procedures effectively manage the risk to an acceptable level. The risk that senior management might override important financial controls to manipulate financial reporting is also a key area of focus in the fraud risk assessment.\n\nIn practice, many companies combine the objective and risk statements when describing MMR. These MMR statements serve as a target, focusing efforts to identify mitigating controls.\n\nFor each MMR, management determines which control (or controls) address the risk \"sufficiently\" and \"precisely\" (PCAOB AS#5) or \"effectively\" (SEC Guidance) enough to mitigate it. The word \"mitigate\" in this context means the control (or controls) reduces the likelihood of material error presented by the MMR to a \"remote\" probability. This level of assurance is required because a material weakness must be disclosed if there is a \"reasonably possible\" or \"probable\" possibility of a material misstatement of a significant account. Even though multiple controls may bear on the risk, only those that address it as defined above are included in the assessment. In practice, these are called the \"in-scope\" or \"key\" controls that require testing.\n\nThe SEC Guidance defines the probability terms as follows, per FAS5 \"Accounting for Contingent Liabilities\":\n\nJudgment is typically the best guide for selecting the most important controls relative to a particular risk for testing. PCAOB AS5 introduces a three-level framework describing entity-level controls at varying levels of precision (direct, monitoring, and indirect.) As a practical matter, control precision by type of control, in order of most precise to least, may be interpreted as:\n\n\nIt is increasingly difficult to argue that reliance upon controls is reasonable in achieving assertion-level objectives as one travels along this continuum from most precise to least, and as risk increases. A combination of type 3-6 controls above may help reduce the number of type 1 & 2 controls (transaction-level) that require assessment for particular risks, especially in lower-risk, transaction-intensive processes.\n\nUnder the 2007 guidance, it appears acceptable to place significantly more reliance on the period-end controls (i.e., review of journal entries and account reconciliations) and management review controls than in the past, effectively addressing many of the material misstatement risks and enabling either: a) the elimination of a significant number of transactional controls from the prior-year's scope of testing; or b) reducing related evidence obtained. The number of transaction-level controls may be reduced significantly, particularly for lower-risk accounts.\n\nThe key SEC principle regarding evidence decisions can be summarized as follows: \"Align the nature, timing and extent of evaluation procedures on those areas that pose the greatest risks to reliable financial reporting.\" The SEC has indicated that the sufficiency of evidence required to support the assessment of specific MMR should be based on two factors: a) Financial Element Misstatement Risk (\"Misstatement Risk\") and b) Control Failure Risk. These two concepts together (the account- or disclosure-related risks and control-related risks) are called \"Internal Control over Financial Reporting Risk\" or \"ICFR\" risk. A diagram was included in the guidance (shown in this section) to illustrate this concept; it is the only such diagram, which indicates the emphasis placed on it by the SEC. ICFR risk should be associated with the in-scope controls identified above and may be part of that analysis. This involves the following steps:\n\nManagement assigned a misstatement risk ranking (high, medium or low) for each significant account and disclosure as part of the scoping assessment above. The low, medium, or high ranking assessed should also be associated with the risk statements and control statements related to the account. One way of accomplishing this is to include the ranking within the risk statement and control statement documentation of the company. Many companies use databases for this purpose, creating data fields within their risk and control documentation to capture this information.\n\nCFR is applied at the individual control level, based on factors in the guidance related to complexity of processing, manual vs. automated nature of the control, judgment involved, etc. Management fundamentally asks the question: \"How difficult is it to execute this control properly each and every time?\"\n\nWith account misstatement risk and CFR defined, management can then conclude on ICFR risk (low, medium, or high) for the control. ICFR is the key risk concept used in evidence decisions.\n\nThe ICFR rating is captured for each control statement. Larger companies typically have hundreds of significant accounts, risk statements, and control statements. These have a \"many to many\" relationship, meaning risks can apply to multiple accounts and controls can apply to multiple risks.\n\nThe guidance provides flexibility in the timing, nature and extent of evidence based on the interaction of Misstatement Risk and Control Failure Risk (together, ICFR Risk). These two factors should be used to update the \"Sampling and Evidence Guide\" used by most companies. As these two risk factors increase, the sufficiency of evidence required to address each MMR increases.\n\nManagement has significant flexibility regarding the following testing and evidence considerations, in the context of the ICFR risk related to a given control:\n\n\nPervasive factors that also affect the evidence considerations above include:\n\n\nManagement has significant discretion in who performs its testing. The SEC guidance indicates that the objectivity of the person testing a given control should increase proportionally to the ICFR risk related to that control. Therefore, techniques such as self-assessment are appropriate for lower-risk areas, while internal auditors (or the equivalent) generally should test higher-risk areas. An intermediate technique in practice is \"quality assurance,\" where manager A tests manager B's work, and vice versa.\n\nThe external auditors ability to rely on management's testing follows similar logic. Reliance is proportional to the competence and objectivity of the management person that completed the testing, also in the context of risk. For the highest risk areas, such as the control environment and period-end reporting process, internal auditors or compliance teams are likely the best choices to perform testing, if a significant degree of reliance is expected from the external auditor. The ability of the external auditor to rely on management's assessment is a major cost factor in compliance.\n\nThere are a variety of specific opportunities to make the SOX 404 assessment as efficient as possible. Some are more long-term in nature (such as centralization and automation of processing) while others can be readily implemented. Frequent interaction between management and the external auditor is essential to determining which efficiency strategies will be effective in each company's particular circumstances and the extent to which control scope reduction is appropriate.\n\nCentralize: Using a shared service model in key risk areas enables multiple locations to be treated as one for testing purposes. Shared service models are typically used for payroll and accounts payable processes, but can be applied to many types of transaction processing. According to a recent survey by Finance Executives International, decentralized companies had dramatically higher SOX compliance costs than centralized companies.\n\nAutomate and benchmark: Key fully automated IT application controls have minimal sample size requirements (usually one, as opposed to as many as 30 for manual controls) and may not have to be tested directly at all under the benchmarking concept. Benchmarking (see Appendix B of the PCAOB guidance) allows fully automated IT application controls to be excluded from testing if certain IT change management controls are effective. For example, many companies rely heavily on manual interfaces between systems, with spreadsheets created for downloading and uploading manual journal entries. Some companies process thousands of such entries each month. By automating manual journal entries, both labor and SOX assessment costs may be dramatically reduced. In addition, the reliability of financial statements is improved.\n\nReview testing approach and documentation: Many companies or external audit firms mistakenly attempted to impose generic frameworks over unique transaction-level processes or across locations. For instance, most of the COSO Framework elements represent indirect entity-level controls, which should be tested separately from transactional processes. In addition, IT security controls (a subset of ITGC) and shared service controls can be placed in separate process documentation, enabling more efficient assignment of test responsibility and removing redundancy across locations. Testing the key journal entries and account reconciliations as separate efforts enables additional efficiency and focus to be brought to these critical controls.\n\nRely on direct entity-level controls: The guidance emphasizes identifying which direct entity-level controls, particularly the period-end process and certain monitoring controls, are sufficiently precise to remove assertion-level (transactional) controls from scope. The key is to determine which combination of entity-level and assertion-level controls address particular MMR.\n\nMinimize roll-forward testing: Management has more flexibility under the new guidance to extend the effective date of testing performed during mid-year (\"interim\") periods to the year-end date. Only the higher risk controls will likely require roll-forward testing under the new guidance. PCAOB AS5 indicates that inquiry procedures, regarding whether changes in the control process occurred between the interim and year-end period, may be sufficient in many cases to limit roll-forward testing.\n\nRevisit scope of locations or business units assessed: This is a complex area requiring substantial judgment and analysis. The 2007 guidance focused on specific MMR, rather than dollar magnitude in determining the scope and sufficiency of evidence to be obtained at decentralized units. The interpretation (common under the pre-2007 guidance) that a unit or group of units was material and therefore a large number of controls across multiple processes require testing irrespective of risk, has been superseded. Where account balances from single units or groups of similar units are a material portion of the consolidated account balance, management should carefully consider whether MMR may exist in a particular unit. Testing focused on just the controls related to the MMR should then be performed. Monitoring controls, such as detailed performance review meetings with robust reporting packages, should also be considered to limit transaction-specific testing.\n\nFocus IT general control (ITGC) testing: ITGC are \"not\" included in the definition of entity-level controls under the SEC or PCAOB guidance. Therefore, ITGC testing should be performed to the extent it addresses specific MMR. By nature, ITGC enables management to place reliance on fully automated application controls (i.e., those that operate without human intervention) and IT-dependent controls (i.e., those that involve the review of automatically generated reports). Focused ITGC testing is merited to support the control objectives or assertions that fully automated controls have not been changed without authorization and that control reporting generated is both accurate and complete. Key ITGC focus areas therefore likely to be critical include: change management procedures applied to specific financial system implementations during the period; change management procedures sufficient to support a benchmarking strategy; and periodic monitoring of application security, including separation of duties.\n\nThe PCAOB issues \"Staff Audit Practice Alerts\" (SAPA) periodically that \"highlight new, emerging or otherwise noteworthy circumstances that may affect how auditors conduct audits under the existing requirements of the standards...\" Under SAPA #11 \"Considerations for Audits of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\" (October 24, 2013), the PCAOB discussed significant audit practice issues regarding ICFR assessment. These included, among other topics:\n\nSAPA #11 may translate into more work for management teams, which may be required by auditors to retain evidence that these reports and queries were accurate and complete. Further, management may be required to retain additional evidence of investigation where detective control report amounts contain transactions or trends outside of predefined tolerance ranges.\n"}

The sheet is provided in rolls weighing up to 1000 kg. Alternatively the resin and related materials may be mixed on site when a producer wants greater control over the chemistry and filler.\n\nSMC is both a process and reinforced composite material. This is manufactured by dispersing long strands (usually >1”) of chopped fiber (commonly glass fibers or carbon fibers on a bath of thermoset resin (commonly polyester resin, vinyl ester resin or epoxy resin)). The longer fibers in SMC result in better strength properties than standard bulk moulding compound (BMC) products. Typical applications include demanding electrical applications, corrosion resistant needs, structural components at low cost, automotive, and transit. \n\nPaste reservoir dispenses a measured amount of specified resin paste onto a plastic carrier film. This carrier film passes underneath a chopper which cuts the fibers onto the surface. Once these have drifted through the depth of resin paste, another sheet is added on top which sandwiches the glass. The sheets are compacted and then enter onto a take-up roll, which is used to store the product whilst it matures. The carrier film is then later removed and the material is cut into charges. Depending on what shape is required determines the shape of the charge and steel die which it is then added to. Heat and pressure act on the charge and once fully cured, this is then removed from the mould as the finished product. Fillers both reduce weight and change the physical properties, typically adding strength. Production challenges include wetting the filler, which could consist of glass microspheres or aligned fibers rather than random chopped fibers; adjusting die temperature and pressure to provide the proper geometry; and adjusting chemistry to end use.\n\nCompared to similar methods, SMC benefits from a very high volume production ability, excellent part reproducibility, it is cost effective as low labor requirements per production level is very good and industry scrap is reduced substantially. Weight reduction, due to lower dimensional requirements and because of the ability to consolidate many parts into one, is also advantageous. The level of flexibility also exceeds many counterpart processes.\n\nProperties vary depending upon fiber and resin types.\n\n"}

{"id": "222839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222839", "title": "Welfare state", "text": "Welfare state\n\nThe welfare state is a form of government in which the state protects and promotes the economic and social well-being of the citizens, based upon the principles of equal opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for citizens unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions for a good life. The sociologist T. H. Marshall described the modern welfare state as a distinctive combination of democracy, welfare, and capitalism. As a type of mixed economy, the welfare state funds the governmental institutions for healthcare and education along with direct benefits paid to individual citizens. \n\nModern welfare states include Germany and France, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as the Nordic countries, which employ a system known as the Nordic model. The various implementations of the welfare state fall into three categories: (i) social democratic, (ii) conservative, and (iii) liberal.\n\nThe German term \"sozialstaat\" (\"social state\") has been used since 1870 to describe state support programs devised by German \"sozialpolitiker\" (\"social politicians\") and implemented as part of Bismarck's conservative reforms. In Germany, the term \"wohlfahrtsstaat\", a direct translation of the English \"welfare state\", is used to describe Sweden's social insurance arrangements.\n\nThe literal English equivalent \"social state\" did not catch on in Anglophone countries. However, during the Second World War, Anglican Archbishop William Temple, author of the book \"Christianity and the Social Order\" (1942), popularized the concept using the phrase \"welfare state.\" Bishop Temple's use of \"welfare state\" has been connected to Benjamin Disraeli's 1845 novel \"Sybil: or the Two Nations\" (in other words, the rich and the poor), where he writes \"power has only one duty — to secure the social welfare of the PEOPLE\". At the time he wrote \"Sybil\", Disraeli (later a prime minister) belonged to Young England, a conservative group of youthful Tories who disagreed with how the Whig dealt with the conditions of the industrial poor. Members of Young England attempted to garner support among the privileged classes to assist the less fortunate and to recognize the dignity of labor that they imagined had characterized England during the Feudal Middle Ages.\n\nThe Swedish welfare state is called \"folkhemmet\" (\"the people's home\") and goes back to the 1936 compromise, as well as another important contract made in 1938, between Swedish trade unions and large corporations. Even though the country is often rated comparably economically free, Sweden's mixed economy remains heavily influenced by the legal framework and continual renegotiations of union contracts, a government-directed and municipality-administered system of social security, and a system of universal health care that is run by the more specialized and in theory more politically isolated county councils of Sweden.\n\nThe Italian term \"stato sociale\" (\"social state\") and the Turkish term \"sosyal devlet\" reproduces the original German term. In French, the concept is expressed as \"l'État-providence\". Spanish and many other languages employ an analogous term: \"estado del bienestar\" – literally, \"state of well-being\". In Portuguese, two similar phrases exist: \"estado de bem-estar social\", which means \"state of social well-being\", and \"estado de providência\" – \"providing state\", denoting the state's mission to ensure the basic well-being of the citizenry. In Brazil, the concept is referred to as \"previdência social\", or \"social providence\".\n\nModern welfare programs are chiefly distinguished from earlier forms of poverty relief by their universal, comprehensive character. The institution of social insurance in Germany under Bismarck was an influential example. Some schemes were based largely in the development of autonomous, mutualist provision of benefits. Others were founded on state provision. In a highly influential essay, \"Citizenship and Social Class\" (1949), British sociologist T. H. Marshall identified modern welfare states as a distinctive combination of democracy, welfare, and capitalism, arguing that citizenship must encompass access to social, as well as to political and civil rights. Examples of such states are Germany, all of the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, France, Uruguay and New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the 1930s. Since that time, the term welfare state applies only to states where social rights are accompanied by civil and political rights.\n\nChanged attitudes in reaction to the worldwide Great Depression, which brought unemployment and misery to millions, were instrumental in the move to the welfare state in many countries. During the Great Depression, the welfare state was seen as a \"middle way\" between the extremes of communism on the left and unregulated \"laissez-faire\" capitalism on the right. In the period following World War II, countries in Western Europe moved from partial or selective provision of social services to relatively comprehensive \"cradle-to-grave\" coverage of the population.\n\nThe activities of present-day welfare states extend to the provision of both cash welfare benefits (such as old-age pensions or unemployment benefits) and in-kind welfare services (such as health or childcare services). Through these provisions, welfare states can affect the distribution of wellbeing and personal autonomy among their citizens, as well as influencing how their citizens consume and how they spend their time.\n\nEmperor Ashoka of India put forward his idea of a welfare state in the 3rd century BCE. He envisioned his \"dharma\" (religion or path) as not just a collection of high-sounding phrases. He consciously tried to adopt it as a matter of state policy; he declared that \"all men and my children\" and \"whatever exertion I make, I strive only to discharge debt that I owe to all living creatures.\" It was a totally new ideal of kingship. Ashoka renounced war and conquest by violence and forbade the killing of many animals. Since he wanted to conquer the world through love and faith, he sent many missions to propagate Dharma. Such missions were sent to places like Egypt, Greece, and Sri Lanka. The propagation of Dharma included many measures of people's welfare. Centers of the treatment of men and beasts founded inside and outside of empire. Shady groves, wells, orchards and rest houses were laid out. Ashoka also prohibited useless sacrifices and certain forms of gatherings which led to waste, indiscipline and superstition. To implement these policies he recruited a new cadre of officers called Dharmamahamattas. Part of this group's duties was to see that people of various sects were treated fairly. They were especially asked to look after the welfare of prisoners.\n\nThe concepts of welfare and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of \"Zakat\" (charity), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, under the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century. This practice continued well into the Abbasid era of the Caliphate. The taxes (including \"Zakat\" and \"Jizya\") collected in the treasury of an Islamic government were used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist Al-Ghazali (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to stockpile food supplies in every region in case a disaster or famine occurred. The Caliphate can thus be considered the world's first major welfare state.\n\nHistorian Robert Paxton observes that on the European continent the provisions of the welfare state were originally enacted by conservatives in the late nineteenth century and by fascists in the twentieth in order to distract workers from unions and socialism, and were opposed by leftists and radicals. He recalls that the German welfare state was set up in the 1880s by Chancellor Bismarck, who had just closed 45 newspapers and passed laws banning the German Socialist Party and other meetings by trade unionists and socialists. A similar version was set up by Count Eduard von Taaffe in the Austro-Hungarian Empire a few years later. Legislation to help the working class in Austria emerged from Catholic conservatives. They turned to social reform by using Swiss and German models and intervening in state economic matters. They studied the Swiss Factory Act of 1877 that limited working hours for everyone, and gave maternity benefits, and German laws that insured workers against industrial risks inherent in the workplace. These served as the basis for Austria's 1885 Trade Code Amendment.\n\n\"All the modern twentieth-century European dictatorships of the right, both fascist and authoritarian, were welfare states\", Paxton writes. \"They all provided medical care, pensions, affordable housing, and mass transport as a matter of course, in order to maintain productivity, national unity, and social peace.\"\nContinental European Marxists opposed piecemeal welfare measures as likely to dilute worker militancy without changing anything fundamental about the distribution of wealth and power. It was only after World War II, when they abandoned Marxism (in 1959 in West Germany, for example), that continental European socialist parties and unions fully accepted the welfare state as their ultimate goal.\n\nIn Britain, the foundations for the welfare state originated with the Liberal Party under prime minister H. H. Asquith and Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George. British liberals supported a capitalist economy and in the nineteenth-century had principally been concerned with issues of free trade (see classical liberalism), but by the turn of the twentieth century they shifted away from \"laissez faire\" economics and began to favor pro-active social legislation to assure equal opportunity for all citizens (and to counteract the appeal of the Labour Party). In this they were directly inspired by the signal success of the German economy under Bismarck's top-down social reforms. \n\nThe French welfare state originated in the 1930s during a period of socialist political ascendency, with the Matignon Accords and the reforms of the Popular Front/ Paxton points out these reforms were paralleled and even exceeded by measures taken by the Vichy regime in the 1940s.\n\nPrior to 1900 in Australia, charitable assistance from benevolent societies, sometimes with financial contributions from the authorities, was the primary means of relief for people not able to support themselves. The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the Labor parties during this period led to a movement for welfare reform.\n\nIn 1900, the states of New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over. Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the federal labor government led by Andrew Fisher introduced a national aged pension under the Invalid and Old-Aged Pensions Act 1908. A national invalid disability pension was started in 1910, and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for: child endowment in 1941; a widows' pension in 1942; a wife’s allowance in 1943; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943; and unemployment, sickness, and special benefits in 1945.\n\nOtto von Bismarck, the first Chancellor of Germany (in office 1871–90), developed the modern welfare state by building on a tradition of welfare programs in Prussia and Saxony that had begun as early as in the 1840s. The measures that Bismarck introduced – old-age pensions, accident insurance, and employee health insurance – formed the basis of the modern European welfare state. His paternalistic programs aimed to forestall social unrest (specifically to prevent an uprising like that of the Paris Commune in 1871), to undercut the appeal of the Social Democratic Party, and to secure the support of the working classes for the German Empire, as well as to reduce emigration to the United States, where wages were higher but welfare did not exist. Bismarck further won the support of both industry and skilled workers through his high-tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade. During the 12 years of Hitler’s Third Reich, the National Socialists expanded and extended the welfare state to the point where over 17 million German citizens were receiving assistance under the auspices of the National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) by 1939, an agency that had projected a powerful image of caring and support.\n\nWelfare states in Latin America have been considered as 'welfare states in transition' or 'emerging welfare states'. Mesa-Lago has classified the countries taking into account the historical experience of their welfare systems. The pioneers were Uruguay, Chile and Argentina, as they started to develop the first welfare programs in the 1920s following a bismarckian model. Other countries such as Costa Rica developed a more universal welfare system (1960s–1970s) with social security programs based on the Beveridge model. Researchers such as Martinez-Franzoni and Barba-Solano have examined and identified several welfare regime models based on the typology of Esping-Andersen. Other scholars such as Riesco and Cruz-Martinez have examined the welfare state development in the region.\n\nAccording to Alex Segura-Ubiergo: Latin American countries can be unequivocally divided into two groups depending on their 'welfare effort' levels. The first group, which for convenience we may call welfare states, includes Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, and Brazil. Within this group, average social spending per capita in the 1973–2000 period was around $532, while as a percentage of GDP and as a share of the budget, social spending reached 51.6 and 12.6 percent, respectively. In addition, between approximately 50 and 75 percent of the population is covered by the public health and pension social security system. In contrast, the second group of countries, which we call non-welfare states, has welfare-effort indices that range from 37 to 88. Within this second group, social spending per capita averaged $96.6, while social spending as a percentage of GDP and as a percentage of the budget averaged 5.2 and 34.7 percent, respectively. In terms of the percentage of the population actually covered, the percentage of the active population covered under some social security scheme does not even reach 10 percent.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar have become welfare states exclusively for their own citizens.\n\nChina traditionally relied on the extended family to provide welfare services. The one-child policy introduced in 1978 has made that unrealistic, and new models have emerged since the 1980s as China has rapidly become richer and more urban. Much discussion is underway regarding China's proposed path toward a welfare state. Chinese policies have been incremental and fragmented in terms of social insurance, privatization, and targeting. In the cities, where the rapid economic development has centered, lines of cleavage, have developed between state-sector and non-state-sector employees and between labor-market insiders and outsiders.\n\nHistorian Derek Fraser tells the British story in a nutshell:\n\nThe modern welfare state in Great Britain began operations with the Liberal welfare reforms of 1906–1914 under Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. These included the passing of the Old-Age Pensions Act in 1908, the introduction of free school meals in 1909, the 1909 Labour Exchanges Act, the Development Act 1909, which heralded greater Government intervention in economic development, and the enacting of the National Insurance Act 1911 setting up a national insurance contribution for unemployment and health benefits from work.\n\nThe minimum wage was introduced in Great Britain in 1909 for certain low-wage industries and expanded to numerous industries, including farm labour, by 1920. However, by the 1920s, a new perspective was offered by reformers to emphasize the usefulness of family allowance targeted at low-income families was the alternative to relieving poverty without distorting the labour market. The trade unions and the Labour Party adopted this view. In 1945, family allowances were introduced; minimum wages faded from view. Talk resumed in the 1970s, but in the 1980s the Thatcher administration made it clear it would not accept a national minimum wage. Finally, with the return of Labour, the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 set a minimum of ₤3.60 per hour, with lower rates for younger workers. It largely affected workers in high turnover service industries such as fast food restaurants, and members of ethnic minorities.\n\nDecember 1942 saw the publication of the \"Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Social Insurance and Allied Services\", commonly known as the Beveridge Report after its chairman, Sir William Beveridge. The Beveridge Report proposed a series of measures to aid those who were in need of help, or in poverty and recommended that the government find ways of tackling what the report called \"the five giants\": Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness. It urged the government to take steps to provide citizens with adequate income, adequate health care, adequate education, adequate housing, and adequate employment, proposing that \"All people of working age should pay a weekly National Insurance contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired, or widowed.\"\n\nThe Beveridge Report assumed that:\n\nThe report stressed the lower costs and efficiency of universal benefits. Beveridge cited miners' pension schemes as examples of some of the most efficient available and argued that a universal state scheme would be cheaper than a myriad of individual friendly societies and private insurance schemes and also less expensive to administer than a means-tested government-run welfare system for the poor.\n\nThe Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, and then the Labour Party all adopted the Beveridge Report's recommendations. Following the Labour election victory in the 1945 general election many of Beveridge's reforms were implemented through a series of Acts of Parliament. On 5 July 1948, the National Insurance Act, National Assistance Act and National Health Service Act came into force, forming the key planks of the modern UK welfare state. In 1949, the Legal Aid and Advice Act was passed, providing the \"fourth pillar\" of the modern welfare state, access to advice for legal redress for all.\n\nBefore 1939, most health care had to be paid for through non-government organisations – through a vast network of friendly societies, trade unions, and other insurance companies, which counted the vast majority of the UK working population as members. These organizations provided insurance for sickness, unemployment, and disability, providing an income to people when they were unable to work. As part of the reforms, the Church of England also closed down its voluntary relief networks and passed the ownership of thousands of church schools, hospitals and other bodies to the state.\n\nWelfare systems continued to develop over the following decades. By the end of the 20th century parts of the welfare system had been restructured, with some provision channelled through non-governmental organizations which became important providers of social services.\n\nThe United States developed a limited welfare state in the 1930s. The earliest and most comprehensive philosophical justification for the welfare state was produced by an American, the sociologist Lester Frank Ward (1841–1913), whom the historian Henry Steele Commager called \"the father of the modern welfare state\".\n\nWard saw social phenomena as amenable to human control. \"It is only through the artificial control of natural phenomena that science is made to minister to human needs\" he wrote, \"and if social laws are really analogous to physical laws, there is no reason why social science should not receive practical application such as have been given to physical science.\" Ward wrote:\n\nThe charge of paternalism is chiefly made by the class that enjoys the largest share of government protection. Those who denounce it are those who most frequently and successfully invoke it. Nothing is more obvious today than the single inability of capital and private enterprise to take care of themselves unaided by the state; and while they are incessantly denouncing \"paternalism,\" by which they mean the claim of the defenseless laborer and artisan to a share in this lavish state protection, they are all the while besieging legislatures for relief from their own incompetency, and \"pleading the baby act\" through a trained body of lawyers and lobbyists. The dispensing of national pap to this class should rather be called \"maternalism,\" to which a square, open, and dignified paternalism would be infinitely preferable.\nWard's theories centred around his belief that a universal and comprehensive system of education was necessary if a democratic government was to function successfully. His writings profoundly influenced younger generations of progressive thinkers such as Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Dewey, and Frances Perkins (1880–1965), among others.\n\nThe United States was the only industrialized country that went into the Great Depression of the 1930s with no social insurance policies in place. In 1935 Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal instituted significant social insurance policies. In 1938 Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act, limiting the work week to 40 hours and banning child labor for children under 16, over stiff congressional opposition from the low-wage South.\n\nThe Social Security law was very unpopular among many groups – especially farmers, who resented the additional taxes and feared they would never be made good. They lobbied hard for exclusion. Furthermore, the Treasury realized how difficult it would be to set up payroll deduction plans for farmers, for housekeepers who employed maids, and for non-profit groups; therefore they were excluded. State employees were excluded for constitutional reasons (the federal government in the United States cannot tax state governments). Federal employees were also excluded. \n\nBy 2013 the U.S. remained the only major industrial state without a uniform national sickness program. American spending on health care (as percent of GDP) is the highest in the world, but it is a complex mix of federal, state, philanthropic, employer and individual funding. The US spent 16% of its GDP on health care in 2008, compared to 11% in France in second place.\n\nSome scholars, such as Gerard Friedman, argue that labor-union weakness in the Southern United States undermined unionization and social reform throughout the United States as a whole, and is largely responsible for the anaemic U.S. welfare state. Sociologists Loïc Wacquant and John L. Campbell contend that since the rise of neoliberal ideology in the late 1970s and early 1980s, an expanding carceral state, or government system of mass incarceration, has largely supplanted the increasingly retrenched social welfare state, which has been justified by its proponents with the argument that the citizenry must take on personal responsibility. Scholars assert that this transformation of the welfare state to a post-welfare punitive state, along with neoliberal structural adjustment policies and the globalization of the U.S. economy, have created more extreme forms of \"destitute poverty\" in the U.S. which must be contained and controlled by expanding the criminal justice system into every aspect of the lives of the poor.\n\nBroadly speaking, welfare states are either universal – with provisions that cover everybody, or selective – with provisions covering only those deemed most needy. In his 1990 book, \"The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism\", Danish sociologist Gøsta Esping-Andersen further identified three subtypes of welfare state models. Though increasingly criticised, these classifications are still used as a starting point in analysis of modern welfare states and remain a fundamental heuristic tool for welfare state scholars. Even for those who claim that in-depth analysis of a single case is more suited to capture the complexity of different social policy arrangements, welfare typologies can provide a comparative lens that can help to place single cases in perspective.\n\nEsping-Andersen's welfare classification acknowledges the historical role of three dominant twentieth-century Western European and American political movements: Social Democracy (socialism), Christian Democracy (conservatism); and Liberalism.\n\nBased on the decommodification index, Esping-Andersen divided 18 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries into the following groups:\n\nSince the building of the decommodification index is limited and the typology is debatable, these 18 countries could be ranked from most purely social-democratic (Sweden) to the most liberal (the United States). Ireland represents a near-hybrid model whereby two streams of unemployment benefit exist: contributory and means-tested. However, payments can begin immediately and are theoretically available to all Irish citizens even if they have never worked, provided they are habitually resident.\n\nSwedish professor of political science Bo Rothstein points out that in non-universal welfare states, the state is primarily concerned with directing resources to \"the people most in need\". This requires tight bureaucratic control in order to determine who is eligible for assistance and who is not. Under universal models such as Sweden, on the other hand, the state distributes welfare to all people who fulfill easily established criteria (e.g. having children, receiving medical treatment, etc.) with as little bureaucratic interference as possible. This, however, requires higher taxation due to the scale of services provided. This model was constructed by the Scandinavian ministers Karl Kristian Steincke and Gustav Möller in the 1930s and is dominant in Scandinavia.\n\nSociologist Lane Kenworthy argues that the Nordic experience demonstrates that the modern social democratic model can \"promote economic security, expand opportunity, and ensure rising living standards for all ... while facilitating freedom, flexibility and market dynamism.\"\n\nFinally, scholars have also proposed to classify welfare regimes using 'outcomes', such as inequalities, poverty rates, response to different social risks, rather than simply focusing on institutional configurations.\n\nAmerican political scientist Benjamin Radcliff has also argued that the universality and generosity of the welfare state (i.e. the extent of decommodification) is the single most important societal-level structural factor affecting the quality of human life, based on the analysis of time serial data across both the industrial democracies and the American States. He maintains that the welfare state improves life for everyone, regardless of social class (as do similar institutions, such as pro-worker labor market regulations and strong labor unions).\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that taxes and transfers considerably reduce poverty in most countries whose welfare states constitute at least a fifth of GDP.\n\nResearchers have found very little correlation between economic performance and social expenditure. They also see little evidence that social expenditures contribute to losses in productivity; economist Peter Lindert of the University of California, Davis attributes this to policy innovations such as the implementation of \"pro-growth\" tax policies in real-world welfare states.\n\nNor have social expenses contributed significantly to public debt.According to the OECD, social expenditures in its 34 member countries rose steadily between 1980 and 2007, but the increase in costs was almost completely offset by GDP growth. More money was spent on welfare because more money circulated in the economy and because government revenues increased. In 1980, the OECD averaged social expenditures equal to 16 percent of GDP. In 2007, just before the financial crisis kicked into full gear, they had risen to 19 percent – a manageable increase.\n\nA Norwegian study covering the period 1980 to 2003 found welfare state spending correlated negatively with student achievement. However, many of the top-ranking OECD countries on the 2009 PISA tests are considered welfare states.\n\nThe table below shows: first – social expenditure as a percentage of GDP for selected OECD member states; second – GDP per capita (PPP US$) in 2013:\n\nEarly conservatives, under the influence of Thomas Malthus, opposed every form of social insurance \"root and branch\". They argued, according to economist Brad DeLong, that it would \"make the poor richer, and they would become more fertile. As a result, farm sizes would drop (as land was divided among ever more children), labor productivity would fall, and the poor would become even poorer. Social insurance was not just pointless; it was counterproductive.\" Malthus, a clergyman for whom birth control was anathema, believed that the poor needed to learn the hard way to practice frugality, self-control and chastity. Traditional conservatives also protested that the effect of social insurance would be to weaken private charity and loosen traditional social bonds of family, friends, religious and non-governmental welfare organisations.\n\nKarl Marx, on the other hand, opposed piecemeal reforms advanced by middle-class reformers out of a sense of duty. In his \"Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League\", written after the failed revolution of 1848, he warned that measures designed to increase wages, improve working conditions and provide social insurance were merely bribes that would temporarily make the situation of working classes tolerable to weaken the revolutionary consciousness that was needed to achieve a socialist economy. Nevertheless, Marx also proclaimed that the Communists had to support the bourgeoisie wherever it acted as a revolutionary progressive class because \"bourgeois liberties had first to be conquered and then criticised\".\n\nIn the 20th century, opponents of the welfare state have expressed apprehension about the creation of a large, possibly self-interested, bureaucracy required to administer it and the tax burden on the wealthier citizens that this entailed.\n\nPolitical historian Alan Ryan points out that the modern welfare state stops short of being an \"advance in the direction of socialism... its egalitarian elements are more minimal than either its defenders or its critics think\". It does not entail advocacy for social ownership of industry. The modern welfare state, Ryan writes, does not set out\nto make the poor richer and the rich poorer, which is a central element in socialism, but to help people to provide for themselves in sickness while they enjoy good health, to put money aside to cover unemployment while they are in work, and to have adults provide for the education of their own and other people's children, expecting those children's future taxes to pay in due course for the pensions of their parents’ generation. These are devices for shifting income across different stages in life, not for shifting income across classes. Another distinct difference is that social insurance does not aim to transform work and working relations; employers and employees pay taxes at a level they would not have done in the nineteenth century, but owners are not expropriated, profits are not illegitimate, cooperativism does not replace hierarchical management.\n\nHistorian Walter Scheidel has commented that the establishment of welfare states in the West in the early 20th century could be partly a reaction by elites to the Bolshevik Revolution and its violence against the bourgeoisie, which feared violent revolution in its own backyard. They were diminished decades later as the perceived threat receded:\n\nIt's a little tricky because the US never really had any strong leftist movement. But if you look at Europe, after 1917 people were really scared about communism in all the Western European countries. \"You have all these poor people, they might rise up and kill us and take our stuff.\" That wasn't just a fantasy because it was happening next door. And that, we can show, did trigger steps in the direction of having more welfare programs and a rudimentary safety net in response to fear of communism. Not that they [the communists] would invade, but that there would be homegrown movements of this sort. American populism is a little different because it's more detached from that. But it happens roughly at the same time, and people in America are worried about communism, toonot necessarily very reasonably. But that was always in the background. And people have only begun to study systematically to what extent the threat, real or imagined, of this type of radical regime really influenced policy changes in Western democracies. You don't necessarily even have to go out and kill rich peopleif there was some plausible alternative out there, it would arguably have an impact on policy making at home. That's certainly there in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s. And there's a debate, right, because it becomes clear that the Soviet Union is really not in very good shape, and people don't really like to be there, and all these movements lost their appeal. That's a contributing factor, arguably, that the end of the Cold War coincides roughly with the time when inequality really starts going up again, because elites are much more relaxed about the possibility of credible alternatives or threats being out there.\n\n\n\n"}
