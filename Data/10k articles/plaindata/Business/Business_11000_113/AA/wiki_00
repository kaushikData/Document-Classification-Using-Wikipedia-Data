He is the Founder and Managing Partner of Infinity Group, and Founder and Chairman of Innonation. Gal-Or served as a pilot in the Israeli Air Force.\n\nGal-Or was born on September 5, 1962, in Haifa, Israel. His parents, Leah and Benjamin, are professors at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. Gal-Or's mother specializes in chemistry and materials; his father specializes in machinery. Gal-Or attended the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa, where he graduated from the Science-Physics Department. Gal-Or earned a BSc in economics and business management from the University of Haifa and an MBA from Tel Aviv University. Later he graduated from Harvard University's program in venture capital and private equity investments.\n\nGal-Or has four children: Raz, Amit, Talia and Hila.\n\nGal-Or served as a combat pilot in the Israeli Air Force (IDF/AF) for 24 years, flying the F-4 Phantom, F-16 and A-4 Skyhawk. He was also a member of the IDF/AF aerobatic team. On October 16, 1986, he flew in the same formation with Israeli MIA navigator/weapon systems officer (WSO) Ron Arad, who went missing that day. Gal-Or is retired from active reserve duty and serves as an instructor in the military flying school.\n\nGal-Or's career as a private entrepreneur began at the Technion incubator in 1990 upon completing seven years of army service. He returned home to Haifa, registered at the University of Haifa and, together with his mother, established two materials companies: TAN, developing high-grade refractory ceramic oxides, and a venture with the largest Israeli fuels company: Paz Oil Company. Eventually, the latter venture integrated with Paz in exchange for royalties, and TAN was sold. In 1994, Gal-Or was nominated as a manager of Mati Ra'anana, a business development center in Ra'anana jointly established by the JDC, the Ministry of Absorption, the Israel Small and Medium Enterprise Authority (ISMEA), ESRA organization, and the Ra'anana Municipality.\nMati Ra'anana provides professional consulting services, business plan formulation, professional business training, on-going consulting and mentoring, and assistance in obtaining the necessary funding to realize the goals set in the business plan assistance to small and medium sized businesses, and technological start ups. Gal-Or founded a special forum for startup ventures in Mati Ra'anana.\nIn 1998, Gal-Or switched to venture capital and helped found Infinity Group. In 2002 the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) of Israel began a program to privatize the technology incubators. Under the umbrella of Infinity, Gal-Or founded Maayan Ventures, a publicly traded company, where he serves as chairman. Maayan, headquartered in Beersheva, is a working partner of the Israeli government for seed investments and manages more than 60 investment holdings. Infinity also operates technology incubators in Dimona and Sde Boker and is purchasing a share in the incubator in Ofakim. Each incubator has a specialization and Infinity provides them with services and support.\n\nInfinity, backed by the China Development Bank and Clal Industries, manages over 1.5 billion USD and has 23 funds, incubators, and accelerators established throughout China. Notable exits of the fund include: Galileo, Saifun, Shopping.com, ShellCase, Scitex Vision, Digital China, WLCSP, Bazun, and ITS.\n\nIn 2017, Gal-Or was bestowed with the Friendship Award by the Chinese government for his great contribution to China-Israel business relations over the past nearly two decades. The award is the highest honor granted to foreign experts by the Chinese government for their contributions to the country’s economic progress.\n\n\n"}

Designed by Isaiah Rogers, the theater was conceived by impresario Edward Fry, the brother of composer William Henry Fry, who managed the opera house during its entire history.\n\nFry engaged the Sanquerico and Patti Opera Company under the management of John Sefton to perform the first season of opera at the house. The opera house opened on November 22, 1847 with a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's \"Ernani\" with Adelino Vietti in the title role. Sefton and his company were not re-engaged by Fry, and the opera management of the house went to Cesare Lietti for the second season. During his tenure the opera house presented the United States premiere of Verdi's \"Nabucco\" on April 4, 1848.\n\nLietti was also replaced after one season, and the Astor's third and longest lasting opera manager, Max Maretzek, was hired for the third season which commenced in November 1848. The following year Maretzek founded his own opera company, the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company, with whom he continued to stage operas at the Astor Opera House through 1852. Under Maretzek the opera house saw the New York premiere of Donizetti's \"Anna Bolena\" on January 7, 1850 with soprano Apollonia Bertucca (later Maretzek's wife) as the title heroine.\n\nThe theatre was built with the intention of attracting only the \"best\" patrons, the \"uppertens\" of New York society, who were increasingly turning out to see European singers who appeared at local venues such as Niblo's Garden. It was expected that an opera house would be: a substitute for a general drawing room – a refined attraction which the ill-mannered would not be likely to frequent, and around which the higher classes might gather, for the easier interchange of courtesies, and for that closer view which aides the candidacy of acquaintance. In pursuit of this agenda, the theatre was created with the comfort of the upper classes in mind: benches, the normal seating in theatres at the time, were replaced by upholstered seats, available only by subscription, as were the two tiers of boxes. On the other hand, 500 general admission patrons were relegated to the benches of a \"cockloft\" reachable only by a narrow stairway, and otherwise isolated from the gentry below, and the theatre enforced a dress code which required \"freshly shaven faces, evening dress, and kid gloves.\"\n\nLimiting the attendance of the lower classes was partly intended to avoid the problems of rowdyism which plagued other theaters in the entertainment district at the time, especially in the theatres on the Bowery. Nevertheless, it was the deadly Astor Place riot in 1849 which caused the theatre to close permanently – provoked by competing performances of \"Macbeth\" by English actor William Charles Macready at the Opera House (which was operating under the name \"Astor Place Theatre\", not being able to sustain itself on a full season of opera) and American Edwin Forrest at the nearby Broadway Theatre. \n\nAfter the riot, the theater was unable to overcome the reputation of being the \"Massacre Opera House\" at \"DisAster Place.\" By May 1853, the interior had been dismantled and the furnishings sold off, with the shell of the building sold for $140,000 to the New York Mercantile Library, which renamed the building \"Clinton Hall\". \n\nIn 1890, in need of additional space, the Association tore down the opera house building and replaced it with an 11-story building, also called Clinton Hall, which still stands on the site.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n"}

{"id": "42951065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42951065", "title": "Child work in indigenous American cultures", "text": "Child work in indigenous American cultures\n\nChild work covers the application of physical and mental contributions by children towards achieving a personal or communal goal. As a form of prosocial behavior, children's work is often a vital contribution towards community productivity and typically involves non-exploitative motivations for children's engagement in work activities. Activities can range from domestic household chores to participation in family and community endeavors. Inge Bolin notes that children's work can blur the boundaries between learning, play, and work in a form of productive interaction between children and adults. Such activities do not have to be mutually exclusive.\n\nChildren's work is a valued means of learning and child-rearing in many Indigenous American communities. It is seen as eagerly contributing in a collaborative and flexible environment, aimed at the children learning consideration, responsibility, and skills with the guidance and support of adults. Indigenous American children are motivated to participate in the community because of cultural values, for example, everyone does something to participate, and wanting to be an equal member of society. The children do not see it as working, but as helping, because they feel responsible for what happens within their communities. As demonstrated by a Mexican Nahua community, children are encouraged to begin child work at the age of two for about 6 to 7 hours a day. They do not need to be convinced to help, but want to be involved in the activity. Child work can be household help, taking care of family members, or helping in community endeavors. \nIndigenous American children learn functional life skills through real-time observation of adults and interactive participation of these learned skills within the community. Active contributions to family and community work directly affects children's cognitive maturity by allowing children agency over their own development. This maturity at a younger age allows children to perform, potentially, higher-skilled tasks. For example, younger children have shown initiative by helping strangers to make them feel like a part of the community. Children do this by offering to help strangers or by treating them like family. This maturity comes from the community fully incorporating children at a young age and allowing them to participate in everyday tasks. The community trusts their children and treats them as equals, so the children want to engage in the community as much as they can. For example, parents trust their children to translate and negotiate bills with people, when the parents cannot speak the language. \nFor example, the maturity that indigenous American children develop is demonstrated in Zinacantec Mayan communities, where children learn complex motor skills and techniques for weaving through keen observation of working adults and by executing the skills themselves. Also, in Peru, young Chillihuani boys learn how to build shelters and homes by actively assisting adults during the building process by moving and placing appropriate size stones. Ethnographic studies show that Indigenous American children learn intently through keen observation in activities by other children.\n\nChildren's work is also attributed to learning cultural values in addition to individual personality development. Many Indigenous children in Peru develop a sense of responsibility by participating in work often motivated by an internal and external drive to be an active participant in the community. Paradise & De Haan refer to this process as practicing responsibility and reciprocity through role-taking as an observing helper or active performer. Through participation in work, most children in Indigenous American communities identify as cooperative members of a community through first-hand exposure to the direct impact of their action or inaction in community responsibilities. In Guatemalan Mayan communities, children are often expected to take part in these practices. When schools became prevalent, children who were not seen as providing valuable contributions to family and community endeavors may only then be sent away to school to make use of their time.\n\nSome indigenous communities are skeptical of sending their children to western schools, because their children lose the initiative to help their families and are not as motivated. Western schooling is a different way of teaching than indigenous communities teach their children. However, children that go through western schooling learn English and end up translating for their families, which is another way of helping them or another way of learning. The children perfect their English and Spanish, as well as their social skills because they interact with many types of people by translating for their families.\n\nThe initiative that indigenous children demonstrate is part of the process of Learning by Observing and Pitching In. LOPI is a seven faceted process of learning commonly used by indigenous American cultures. It fully immerses a child into the community and allows them to learn, through observation and participation, as they help within their family. Children learn through their work, which is a cultural tradition among indigenous people. Child work is a social experience that allows a child to gain a sense of responsibility and build ties among the community.\n\nThe International Labour Organization recognizes the importance of child work in various cultures. In most Indigenous communities, work is a source of pride for both adults and children. Because of different cultural views involving labor, the International Labour Organization (ILO) developed a series of culturally sensitive mandates including Conventions No. 169, 107, 138, and 182 to protect indigenous culture, traditions, and identities. Conventions No. 138 and 182 lead in the fight against child labour, while No. 107 and 169 promote the right of indigenous and tribal peoples and protect their right to define their own developmental priorities. \nThe ILO recognizes these changes are necessary to respect the culture and traditions of other communities while also looking after the welfare of children. In many Indigenous communities, parenting includes teaching children learn important life lessons through the act of work and through participation in daily life.\n\nWorking is seen as a learning process preparing children for the tasks they will have to do as an adult. It is a belief that the family's and child’s well-being and survival is a shared responsibility between members of the whole family. They also see work as an intrinsic part of their child's developmental process. While these attitudes toward child work remain, many children and parents from indigenous communities still highly value education. ILO wants to include these communities in the fight against exploitative child labor while being sensitive to their traditions and values.\n"}
{"id": "332131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332131", "title": "Corporatization", "text": "Corporatization\n\nCorporatization is the process of transforming state assets, government agencies, or municipal organizations into corporations. It refers to a restructuring of government and public organizations into their administration. The result of corporatization is the creation of state-owned corporations (or corporations at other government levels, such as municipally owned corporations) where the government retains a majority ownership of the corporation's stock.\n\nIn contrast, the term may also refer to the construction of state corporatism, where state-owned corporations are created and delegated public joint-stock, publicly listed companies, in order to introduce corporate and business management techniques to social tasks resembling corporate nationalism as an alternative to privatization. Corporatization can also refer to non-corporate entities like universities or hospitals becoming corporations, or taking up management structures or other features and behaviors employed by corporations.\n\nThe move towards neoliberal economic reform and New Public Management public service reform in the 1980s led to privatization of public functions in many countries. Corporatization was seen as a half-way house on the road to privatization. These state-owned enterprises are organized in the same manner as private corporations, with the difference that the company's shares remain in the ownership of the state and are not traded on the stock market. Corporatization is today often seen as an end in itself in order to introduce autonomy in organizations, hoping that this brings efficiency gains.\n\nSome argue that the trend towards corporatization has sped up due to the financial crisis, although there is evidence that there has been a trend towards corporatization since at least the start of the century.\n\nCorporatization can be used to improve efficiency of public service delivery (with mixed successes), as a step towards (partial) privatization, or to alleviate fiscal stress.\n\nA key purpose of corporatization is externalization. The effect of corporatization has been to convert state departments (or municipal services) into public companies and interpose commercial boards of directors between the shareholding ministers / city council and the management of the enterprises. Such externalization creates legal and managerial autonomy from politicians, which could potentially increase efficiency, as it safeguards the firm from political exploitation. However, corporatization can also fail to bring efficiency (or cause inefficiency), because this autonomy reduces the government's ability to monitor its management. Whether corporatization is beneficial may depend on the nature of the service that is corporatized, where autonomy may be less beneficial for more politicized and complex services.\n\nAlthough corporatization is to be distinguished from privatization (the former involves publicly owned corporations, the latter privately owned ones), once a service has been corporatised it is often relatively easy to privatise or part-privatise it, for example by selling some or all of the company's shares via the stock market. In some cases (e.g. the Netherlands in regard to water supply) there are laws to prevent this. Corporatization also can be a step towards the creation of hybrid forms of organization, such as institutional public-private partnerships or inter-municipal service organizations.\n\nCorporatization is also a means to alleviate fiscal stress, as corporations can become standalone organizations that do not count towards municipalities' budgets.\n\nCorporatization of state enterprises and collectively owned enterprises was a major component of the economic restructuring program of formerly communist nations, most notably the People's Republic of China. China's contemporary socialist market economy is based on a corporatized state sector where state companies are owned by the central government but managed in a semi-autonomous fashion. Corporatization has also been used in New Zealand and most states of Australia in the reform of their electricity markets, as well as in many other countries and industries (e.g. Dutch water supply companies).\n\nOn a national scale, major areas of services which have been corporatized in the past include:\n\nOn a local scale, major areas of services which have been corporatized include:\nSee also Municipally owned corporation.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n"}

A loan or the amount in cash is then required to make the full payment.\n\nThe main purposes of a down payment are to ensure that the lending institution has enough capital to create money for a loan in fractional reserve banking systems and to recover some of the balance due on the loan in the event that the borrower defaults. In real estate, the asset is used as collateral in order to secure the loan against default. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender is legally entitled to sell the asset and retain a portion of the proceeds sufficient to cover the remaining balance on the loan, including fees and interest added. A down payment in this case reduces the lender's risk to less than the value of the collateral, making it more likely that the lender will recover the full amount in the event of default.\n\nThe size of the down payment thus determines the extent to which the lender is protected against the various factors that might reduce the value of the collateral, as well as lost profits between the time of the last payment and the eventual sale of the collateral.\n\nFurthermore, making a down payment demonstrates that the borrower is able to raise a certain amount of money for long-term investment, which the lender may desire as evidence that the borrower's finances are sound, and that the borrower is not borrowing beyond his or her means.\n\nIf the borrower is unable to pay off the loan in its entirety, the down payment amount is forfeited.\n\nIn the United States, down payments for home purchases typically vary between 3.5% and 20% of the purchase price. The Federal Housing Administration has advocated lower down payments since its inception in 1934, and, currently, borrowers that qualify for an FHA loan pay only 3.5% for a down payment. With rising home prices in the years from 2000 to 2007, lenders were willing to accept smaller or no down payment (either through 100% financing, seller-assisted down payment assistance, government down payment providers or by providing a combination of an 80% first and 20% second mortgages) so that more individuals could purchase homes as their primary residences. Currently, in the United States, the Department of Veterans Affairs offers complete financing for qualifying veterans. The USDA Home Loan program also offers complete mortgage loans with no down payment. These loans are available as direct or guaranteed loans and are offered to qualifying borrowers purchasing a home in a more rural area. Most state finance housing agencies offer down payment assistance. In 2013, the agencies offer a program that provides assistance to qualifying homebuyers of up to three percent of the loan amount. The money from the state housing agencies can be used for down payment or closing costs.\n\nThere is more risk for lenders when individuals purchase a home as an investment property. Therefore, the lender may charge a higher interest rate and expect a higher down payment.\n\n"}

His father was a prominent New York automobile and yacht racer. His grandfather, Jabez A. Bostwick, was a partner of John D. Rockefeller and a founder and treasurer of the Standard Oil Trust.\n\nHe attended St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire) and Yale University. During his time at Yale, he served as co-captain of the famous 1932 hockey team and declined an invitation to play in the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.\n\nIn 1932, Bostwick married Electra Webb, a great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and daughter of James Watson Webb, Sr. and Electra Havemeyer Webb. The couple had four daughters and spent their time primarily between New York, NY, Old Westbury, NY, Shelburne, VT and Aiken, SC.\n\nDuring World War II, Bostwick served in London, England with the U.S. Army Air Corps. He returned as a Lieutenant Colonel with a Bronze Star and a Belgian Croix de Guerre for his help in the organization of the Normandy Invasion in 1944.\n\nBostwick's siblings included Dorothy Stokes Bostwick, Albert C. Bostwick, Jr., Lillian Bostwick Phipps and Pete Bostwick. Like his siblings, Bostwick was a competitive horseman, who competed in polo and Harness racing events all over the country. He earned a 6-goal polo handicap and played for the Aiken Knights and the Bostwick Field polo teams during the 1930s.\n\nDuring this time, Bostwick created Bostwick Field with his siblings Pete Bostwick and Lillian Bostwick Phipps. During the Great Depression, the Bostwicks believed that everyone should be able to watch polo without being overcharged, which inspired Bostwick Field. The slogan of the field was \"Polo for the Populace.\"\n\nAfter he gave up polo in the 1940s, Bostwick turned to harness racing. He bred, trained and raced many successful Standardbred trotters from his Bostwick Stables in Shelburne, Vermont.\n\nWhen his most famous horse, Chris Spencer, went lame, Bostwick swam the horse twice a day in Lake Champlain. Eventually, the horse was back in racing condition and went on to win important races including the 1949 American Trotting Championship and Golden West Trot and the 1950 Roosevelt Trot. Chris Spencer was inducted into the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1979. Chris Spencer was also the first horse to fly on an airplane, from Vermont to California to win the Hollywood Stakes race in 1952.\n\nBostwick was a member of the United States Harness Racing Hall of Fame and founded the Saratoga Harness Racing Association and the Aiken Mile Track.\n\nThroughout his life, Bostwick was engaged in multiple business ventures. He invented the magnetic snap barrier, an early gate that preceded current moving gates used at modern horse racetracks. Additionally, he served on the boards of the Aviation Instrument Manufacturing Corporation and Helio Aircraft Corporation, among others.\n\nDunbar Bostwick died in 2006 at age 98 at his home in Shelburne, Vermont.\n\n"}

Davis was 19 when his father died; he inherited his father's public relations firm and left college. In the late 1970s and early '80s, Davis was majority partner in Tulsa, Oklahoma advertising agency Davis & Nauser (with partner Jeffery Nauser), where his client list included just one political candidate, his uncle, then Tulsa mayoral candidate and current U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R, Oklahoma).\n\nDavis left for California when Oklahoma's economy suffered from the collapse of the local oil industry. He founded and leads Strategic Perception, an advertising firm based in Hollywood.\n\nHe created the \"Celebrity\" ad for presidential candidate John McCain and the \"Demon Sheep\" video for California Senate candidate Carly Fiorina. Davis was described as \"the most creative person in the business\" by Republican media consultant Mark McKinnon. His political clients have included President George W. Bush, presidential candidates Dan Quayle, John McCain, Jon Huntsman and John Kasich. Senators Jim Inhofe, John Cornyn, Lamar Alexander, John McCain, Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, Chuck Grassley, David Perdue, John Kennedy, Ben Sasse, Elizabeth Dole and Paul Coverdell. Also governors Sonny Perdue, Rick Snyder, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Ernie Fletcher.\n\nHis long-shot gubernatorial campaign for Sonny Perdue in Georgia featured a video of a giant Rat rampaging Georgia. The rat portrayed the current, popular governor Roy Barnes. The video is credited as starting the movement toward viral videos in politics. Perdue beat Barnes handily, in spite of being outspent more than seven to one.\n\nA similar campaign for now-Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan featured the unusual Davis slogan, “One Tough Nerd.” The slogan caught on across the state helping propel the unknown Snyder past several statewide office holders into a primary win without a runoff, then the general election.\n\nHe created a well-known 2010 ad for U.S. Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell which featured her declaring she was \"not a witch\", in response to the re-airing of past statements made by her about her interactions with non-Christian religious practices. O’Donnell’s witch statements had become a staple of late night comedy programs, including Saturday Night Live, before Davis was hired.\n\nIn February 2012, Davis authored a controversial ad for Representative Pete Hoekstra for his Senate campaign against incumbent Democrat Debbie Stabenow. The ad attacked Stabenow as Debbie \"Spend-it-now\" and showed an Asian woman riding a bicycle in a rice paddy thanking Stabenow (in broken English) for enriching the Chinese economy at the expense of the U.S. \n\nRepublican strategist Mike Murphy tweeted that the ad was \"really, really dumb,\" while Stabenow called it \"shocking\" and \"nasty.\" Hoekstra denied that the ad was insensitive to Chinese Americans and was meant to focus on Stabenow's voting record. Within two weeks, the Hoekstra campaign removed the video from his campaign website and YouTube account.\n\nIn 2012, Davis’ firm prepared a 57-page plan (commissioned by billionaire Joe Ricketts) for a $10 million campaign attempting to defeat the re-election of President Obama. It partially recycled points of criticism against Obama from the 2008 presidential campaign, including his relationship with Obama’s reverend, Jeremiah Wright. The proposal, titled, \"The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good,\" was initially approved by the Ricketts' Ending Spending Action Fund.\n\nA copy of the proposal document was released by a person unconnected to the ad campaign to \"The New York Times\", after which it was roundly lambasted in external commentary. Ricketts then disavowed commissioning the plan. Although Davis' agency had gone at least as far as contacting Larry Elder to join the project, no ads were ever aired. Ricketts issued a statement disavowing the ad campaign hours after it was publicized by the \"New York Times.\"\n\nOther clients of Davis include George W. Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n"}

Employed by a Chicago advertising agency, he started operating the elevator and worked his way up to become a copywriter.\n\nIn 1907, Adams borrowed money to rent and equip an office and launched the Adams Newspaper Service. Adams' syndicate was located at 8 West 40th Street in Manhattan. When Adams and \"Emporia Gazette\" publisher William Allen White met in Chicago in 1908, Adams hired White to write about political issues. Adams had copies of Walt Mason's light verse which he had clipped from the \"Gazette\", and said, \"I like this stuff. I'd like to syndicate it to other papers. Suppose I could?\" White responded, \"Sure. Give Uncle Walt about $18 a week, and he'll be tickled pink to do it for you.\" Adams did, and as Mason's \"Rippling Rhythms\" column increased in popularity, he eventually increased Mason's salary to $15,000 a year.\n\nThe name of the Adams Newspaper Service was changed in 1916 to the George Matthew Adams Service.

{"id": "457460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457460", "title": "Guaranteed minimum income", "text": "Guaranteed minimum income\n\nGuaranteed minimum income (GMI), also called minimum income, is a system of social welfare provision that guarantees that all citizens or families have an income sufficient to live on, provided they meet certain conditions. Eligibility is typically determined by citizenship, a means test, and either availability for the labour market or a willingness to perform community services. The primary goal of a guaranteed minimum income is to reduce poverty. If citizenship is the only requirement, the system turns into a universal basic income.\n\nA system of guaranteed minimum income can consist of several elements, most notably:\n\n\nBasic income means the provision of identical payments from a government to all of its citizens. Guaranteed minimum income is a system of payments (possibly only one) by a government to citizens who fail to meet one or more means tests. While most modern countries have some form of GMI, a basic income is rare.\n\nThe first Muslim caliph, Abu Bakr, introduced a guaranteed minimum standard of income, granting each man, woman, and child ten dirhams annually; this was later increased to twenty dirhams.\n\nIn 1795, American revolutionary Thomas Paine advocated a citizen's dividend to all United States citizens as compensation for \"loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property\" (\"Agrarian Justice\", 1795).\n\nFrench Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte echoed Paine's sentiments and commented that 'man is entitled by birthright to a share of the Earth's produce sufficient to fill the needs of his existence' (Herold, 1955).\n\nThe American economist Henry George advocated for a dividend to be paid to all citizens from the revenue generated by a land value tax.\n\nIn 1963, Robert Theobald published the book \"Free Men and Free Markets\", in which he advocated a \"guaranteed minimum income\" (the origin of the modern version of the phrase).\n\nIn 1966, the Cloward–Piven strategy advocated \"overloading\" the US welfare system to force its collapse in the hopes that it would be replaced by \"a guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty\".\n\nIn his final book \"\" (1967), Martin Luther King Jr. wrote\nIn 1968, James Tobin, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce in that year a system of income guarantees and supplements.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon proposed reforms to the welfare program in 1969, where a minimum income would be paid to poor families. Contrary to popular belief, Nixon was critical of the idea of a guaranteed universal basic income. The proposal by Nixon passed in the House but never made it out of committee in the Senate.\n\nIn 1973, Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote \"The Politics of a Guaranteed Income\", in which he advocated the guaranteed minimum income and discussed Richard Nixon's Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) proposal.\n\nIn 1987, New Zealand's Labour Finance Minister Roger Douglas announced a Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Scheme to accompany a new flat tax. Both were quashed by then Prime Minister David Lange, who sacked Douglas.\n\nIn his 1994 \"autobiographical dialog\", classical liberal Friedrich Hayek stated: \"I have always said that I am in favor of a minimum income for every person in the country\".\n\nIn 2013, The Equal Life Foundation published the Living Income Guaranteed Proposal illustrating a practical way to implement and fund a minimum guaranteed income.\n\nIn 2017, Harry A. Shamir (US) published a book \"Consumerism, or Capitalism Without Crises\" in which the concept was promoted by another label, as a way to enable our civilization to survive in an era of automation and computerization and large scale unemployment. The book also innovates a method to fund the process, tapping into the underground economy and volunteerism.\n\nOther modern advocates include Hans-Werner Sinn (Germany), Ayşe Buğra (Turkey), The Green Economics Institute (GEI), and Andrew Coyne (Canada).\n\nTax revenues would fund the majority of any GMI proposal. As most GMI proposals seek to create an earnings floor close to or above poverty lines amongst all citizens, the fiscal burden would require equally broad tax sources, such as income taxes or VATs, in order to fund such expenditures. To varying degrees, a GMI might be funded through the reduction or elimination of other social security programs such as unemployment insurance.\n\nAnother approach for funding is to acknowledge that all modern economies use fiat money and thus taxation is not necessary for funding; However, the fact that there are no financial constraints does not mean other constraints, such as on real resources, do not exist. A likely outcome based on the economic theory known as Modern Monetary Theory would be a moderate increase in taxation to ensure the extra income would not cause demand-pull inflation; This hypothetical Chartalist approach can be seen in the implementation of quantitative easing programs where, in the United States, over three trillion dollars were created without requiring taxes.\n\nIn July 2013, the Cypriot government unveiled a plan to reform the welfare system in Cyprus and create a \"Guaranteed Minimum Income\" for all citizens.\n\nIn 1988, France was one of the first countries to implement a minimum income, called the Revenu minimum d'insertion. In 2009, it was turned into Revenu de solidarité active (RSA), a new system which aimed at solving the poverty trap by providing low-wage workers a complementary income; thus encouraging activity.\n\nThe United States has multiple social programs that provide guaranteed minimum incomes for individuals meeting certain criteria such as assets or disability. For instance, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a United States government program that provides stipends to low-income people who are either aged (65 or older), blind, or disabled. SSI was created in 1974 to replace federal-state adult assistance programs that served the same purpose. Today the program provides benefits to approximately eight million Americans. Another such program is Social Security Disability Insurance (SSD or SSDI), a payroll tax-funded, federal insurance program. It is managed by the Social Security Administration and is designed to provide income supplements to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be employed because of a notable disability, usually a physical disability. SSD can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the person's disability is temporary or permanent.\n\nAn early guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. was the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), established by the Social Security Act. Where previously the responsibility to assist needy children lay in the hands of the states, AFDC transferred that authority to the federal government. Over time, the AFDC was often criticized for creating disincentives to work, leading to many arguing for its replacement. In the 1970s, President Richard M. Nixon proposed the Family Assistance Program (FAP) which would replace the AFDC. FAP was designed to fix many of the problems that the AFDC suffered from, particularly the anti-work structure. Presidential nominee George McGovern also proposed a minimum income in the form of a Universal Tax Credit. Ultimately, neither of these programs were implemented. Throughout the decade, many other experimental minimum income programs were carried out in cities throughout the country, such as the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiments. In 1996, under President Bill Clinton, the AFDC was replaced with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This would block grant funds to the states to allow them to decide how aid would be distributed.\n\nAnother guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. is the Earned Income Tax Credit. This is a refundable tax credit that gives poorer families cash assistance every year. The EITC avoids the welfare trap by subsidizing income, rather than replacing it.\n\nMinimum income has been increasingly accepted by the Brazilian government. In 2004, President Lula da Silva signed into law a bill to establish a universal basic income. This law is primarily implemented through the Bolsa Família program. Under this program, poorer families will receive a direct cash payment via a government issued debit card. Bolsa Família is a conditional cash transfer program, meaning that beneficiaries will receive their aid if they accomplish certain actions. Families who receive the aid must put their children in school and participate in vaccination programs. If they do not meet these requirements, they will be cut off from aid. As of 2011, approximately 50 million people, or a quarter of Brazil's population, were participating in Bolsa Família.\n\nCanada has experimented with minimum income trials, both in the past and in the present. The most prominent past example is the Mincome experiment, which ran in Manitoba in the 1970s. Mincome provided lower income families with cash transfers to keep them out of poverty. The researchers conducting Mincome found that it did not disincentivize work. The only recipients who reduced their number of hours worked were single mothers, who could now afford to stay at home and raise their children, and young men who preferred to stay in school rather than work. Budget shortfalls resulted in the shuttering of the program.\n\nIn 2017, the province of Ontario began an minimum income experiment. Approximately 4000 citizens began to receive a stipend based on their family situation and income. Recipients of this program can receive upwards of $10,000 per year. Government researchers are using this pilot as a way of testing to see if a minimum income can help people meet their basic needs.\n\n\n\n"}

He held a Master of Science (M. Sc.) degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.\n\nLarson was responsible for the technical design of the first Volvo model ÖV 4, introduced on 14 April 1927. He and Assar Gabrielsson founded Volvo. He was appointed vice president and technical manager for AB Volvo in Gothenburg, from the time the company was founded 1927. He worked for Volvo until his death in 1968.\n\nIn June 1924 when Gustav Larson met his old friend Assar Gabrielsson in Stockholm, Gabrielsson unveiled his plans to try to establish the manufacturing of a new Swedish automobile. Gustav Larson had worked for SKF between 1917-1919 but now worked for the company AB Galco in Stockholm. They made a verbal agreement in August 1924 at the Sturehof restaurant in Stockholm, then signed a written contract more than one year later, on 16 December 1925. In this contract Gustav was to carry out the engineering work for a new car, as well as an investment plan for a complete new manufacturing plant, but would only be rewarded for that work in case the project would turn out well. Well meant after at least 100 produced cars and in the case this was achieved before 1 January 1928. This famous contract shows that Assar Gabrielsson \"owned\" the project and that it was a high-risk project without any guarantees. Gabrielsson took the economic risks himself and Gustav, in the worst case, would have worked on the project without being rewarded, but still would have had his salary from AB Galco in Stockholm. Most of the capital that Gabrielsson intended to use for the project initially was actually extra sales commissions that he had saved from the time he was the managing director for the SKF subsidiary in Paris in 1921-22.\nGabrielsson had decided to build a test series of ten vehicles with his own financing and later present the car and an entire investment plan to SKF. The idea to build a pre-series of ten vehicles was most certainly related to the fact that no company would have given he and Larsen an offer for the components (engines, gearboxes, chassis components etc.) With less quantity they were certain that SKF would approve plans in due time. Engineering, documentation and investment planning was carried out exactly in the same way, as if it had been carried out by SKF in order to prepare for the set up of a new automobile company. Gabrielsson most certainly had the full support from the managing director of SKF, Mr. Björn Prytz, at that time, as long as his 'private' project did not interfere with his work as sales manager for SKF.\n\nThe first ten pre-series vehicles, model ÖV 4, were designed and assembled in Stockholm at AB Galco under the supervision of Gustav Larson, at that time still having his other work at AB Galco to attend to. A \"design-office\", often called \"Volvo's first design-office\", was established in one room of Larson's private apartment at Rådmansgatan 59. The design work started in the autumn of 1924 and a number of engineers were involved, among them engineer Jan G. Smith, that had returned from America in 1924, and later engineer Henry Westerberg. All the invoices related to the project was sent to Gabrielsson's private address at Kungsportsavenyn 32 in Gothenburg. In a lot of orders that Gustav Larsson made himself, he referred to Gabrielsson as a \"guarantee\" so that the deliveries would be paid by him personally. These details shows that the Volvo automobile project in the beginning was a true private project, not sponsored by SKF from an economic point of view.\n\nThe first prototype car was ready in June 1926. Larsen and Gabrielsson took it and drove themselves, on bumpy roads, down to SKF in Gothenburg to show the SKF-board and now present the final investment plan.\n\nAt a board meeting held in Hofors, Sweden on 10 August 1926, SKF decided to use the old subsidiary company Volvo AB, for the automobile project. AB Volvo, that was first registered in 1915 on the initiative of Björn Prytz, was originally set up to be used for a special series of ball bearings for the American market but it was never really used for this purpose. A small series of ball bearings stamped with Volvo was manufactured but it was never introduced on a larger scale.\n\nA contract was signed on 12 August 1926 between SKF and Gabrielsson, stipulating that all ten prototype cars, engineering drawings, calculations etc. should be handed over to Volvo AB, and Gabrielsson in return would be refunded most of his private investments for the prototype cars. The contract was signed by Björn Prytz, managing director of SKF and Gabrielsson. Gustaf Larsson finally got paid for the initial engineering work with the ÖV4 according to the 'private' contract he and Gabrielsson had signed on 16 December 1925. That 1925 contract had stated that the automobile project may be sold to any company that would be interested, but they hoped that SKF would be the company to first offer.\n\nGustav Larson was appointed vice president and technical manager on 1 January 1927, and left his employment at AB Galco in Stockholm.\n\nOn 14 April 1927, at about 10 p.m., the first series production model, the ÖV 4, left the newly established factory on Hisingen in Gothenburg.\n\nThe ten prototype cars that had been assembled in Stockholm were never sold, except for one that was sold to Volvo's photographer Sven Sjöstedt and was later donated to the Volvo Industrial Museum around 1930. However it was used as transportation vehicles within the manufacturing plant and as 'test benches' for new developed components during the first years.\n\nThe new company did not show any profit for the first couple of years and SKF invested more money to keep the company running. In 1928 the production of trucks began with the basic chassis components from ÖV4. The production of trucks was on a small scale, but the concept was successful from start.\n\nHowever, in late 1929 SKF nearly sold the company to Charles Nash, president of Nash Motors in the United States. Björn Prytz and Gabrielsson managed to convince the SKF board to call the deal off, just one day before Charles Nash arrived by boat in Gothenburg. At the end of 1930 AB Volvo showed a small profit for the first time. In 1935 SKF came to the conclusion that Volvo now was ready to stand on its own feet. Volvo was introduced on the Stockholm stock exchange and SKF sold most of its shares. SKF could now concentrate on their core business, development and manufacturing of bearings, and still are, more than 100 years after the company was founded in 1907.\n\nIn 1941, the 50,000th Volvo car was delivered. It took ten years to produce the first 25,000 cars but only four years for the next 25,000 cars. In 1944-45, just after the end of the Second World War, the modern styled family car PV444, with a completely new design, was introduced and the car was a sales success. The company now stood on solid ground and the production of both cars and trucks continued to increase for the rest of Larsen's life.\n\nGustaf Larson was married to Elin Octavia Fröberg in 1918. They had four children: Erik, Anders, Gunnel, and Britt.\n\nGustaf Larson died on 4 July 1968, and is buried at the family tomb in Båstad, Sweden.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1984 by William O'Neil as a print news publication, it is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Holding a conservative political stance, \"IBD\" provides news and analysis on stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, commodities, and other financial instruments aimed at individual investors and financial professionals.\n\nIn March, 2016, the company announced that \"IBD\" would become a weekly publication and would focus more on digital operations. The publication will continue to use the \"Investor's Business Daily\" name as it will continue to publish daily on its website. In May 2016, the company officially switched to a weekly print publishing schedule and published its first issue of \"IBD Weekly\" while continuing to update its website daily.\n\nEntrepreneur and stockbroker William O'Neil founded the newspaper in 1984 due to frustration with the lack of data about stocks in newspapers. In 1991, the publication's name was changed from \"Investor's Daily\" to \"Investor's Business Daily\". In 1994, ten years after its founding, \"IBD\" was ranked among the fastest-growing newspapers in the country.\n\nIn 2005, the political cartoonist Michael Ramirez joined \"IBD\". In 2008, Ramirez won his second Pulitzer for editorial cartooning while at the company.\n\nIn 2015, the \"IBD\" website was accessed by over 4 million monthly visitors. In 2016, it was announced that the company would change its printing schedule to once a week, but continue to publish new content to its website daily. In May 2016, the first issue of \"IBD Weekly\" was published while the media outlet continued to publish new digital content daily.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election in the U.S., \"IBD\" was one of two polls that consistently showed Donald Trump in the lead. Leading up to the election, \"IBD's\" poll was correctly dismissed as being an \"outlying survey\" and in the end missed the final popular vote tally by four percentage points in Trump's favor.\n\n\"IBD\" takes a conservative political stance in its news and analysis. \"IBD\" provides investor education through its Investor's Corner, the Big Picture, and online resources. The information provided expands on William O'Neil's previous books that detail the CAN SLIM investment strategy. \"IBD\" includes several written sections that detail companies and news of interest. It covers internet and technology stocks in particular, and has a substantial editorial and opinion section. Every Monday in its weekly edition, \"IBD\" publishes a list of 50 stocks that are most attractive based on earnings, stock price performance, and other criteria used in the CAN SLIM strategy.\n\nThe IBD 50 Index is the flagship US stock market benchmark published by the Investor’s Business Daily, similar to how FTSE 100 was to the Financial Times. The index is based on the CAN SLIM methodology invented by the newspaper’s founder William O’Neil, and the list of its constituents is published every Monday. Later it becomes the basis for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) called the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (Ticker: FFTY), which is also rebalanced weekly.\n\nIn July 2009, an editorial in \"Investor's Business Daily\" claimed that physicist Stephen Hawking \"wouldn't have a chance in the U.K., where the [British] National Health Service (NHS) would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless.\" Hawking was British, lived in the United Kingdom nearly all of his life, and received his medical care from the NHS. \"IBD\" later removed the editorial's reference to Hawking in its online version and appended an \"Editor's Note\" which said, \"This version corrects the original editorial which implied that physicist Stephen Hawking, a professor at the University of Cambridge, did not live in the UK.\" Hawking himself responded, \"I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the NHS.

In November 2001, Hussein was arrested at the request of the United States government, which accused him of supporting terrorism through the company. His assets were also frozen. Hussein was eventually exonerated of the charges and released, after a court found that neither the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) nor the U.S.A authorities were able to provide any evidence of terrorist links. In February 2012, all charges against the Al-Barakat Group of Companies were also dropped.\n\nHussein ran two businesses in Ottawa, Ontario. The first was a cleaning company, which he started to offer his family employment and improve their chances of successful immigration to Canada. The second was a \"hawala\", a form of informal money transfer business, named \"Barakaat North America Inc.\" Hussein and his brother ran the latter business out of Dorchester, Massachusetts.\n\nWhen it was announced that al-Qaeda was believed to have ties to the Somali money transfer service, Al-Barakat, which Hussein contracted, his brother was arrested in Boston.

Then it is possible to show for what purposes costs have been incurred.\n\nBusinesses such as retail stores, restaurants and filling stations conduct business with their customers by accepting orders that are spoken or implied by the buyer's actions. Taking a shopping cart of merchandise to a check-out counter is an implied intent to buy the merchandise. Placing a take-out or eat-in order at a restaurant is a spoken purchase order. Putting gasoline in one's tank at a filling station is an implied order. The seller usually expects immediate payment by cash, check or credit card for these purchases, and the seller provides the buyer with a receipt for the payment. In legal terms, this form of business order is an \"implied in fact contract\".\n\nIn commerce, various business documents are used to record the negotiation of an agreement to buy and sell, record the agreement itself, and record compliance with the agreement and closure of the contract. An agreement to buy and sell is a form of contract.\n\nThere are five basic requirements for a contract to exist between two parties: agreement, voluntary, consideration, capacity, and legality. A sixth requirement of \"in writing\" sometimes applies.\n\nThe main concern for commercial orders is that there must be agreement (offer and acceptance) for the order to be a contract. Prior to this, businesses often record the details of negotiations by using a request for quotation, request for bid, sales quotation, or sales bid. Quotations are non-binding and part of the negotiation process. A request for bid can be binding or non-binding, depending on the terms of the bid.\n\nOnce an agreement or contract is in place, businesses record these as confirmed purchase orders and confirmed sales orders.\n\nIn the US, Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code covers commercial contracts, and section 2-103 gives definitions of terms under this code. Section 2-106 describes the difference between a present sale (recorded as a sales order) and a sale (recorded as a transfer of title to the buyer).\n\n(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires \"contract\" and \"agreement\" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \"Contract for sale\" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A \"sale\" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2-401). A \"present sale\" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.\n\nIn their \"Advance Monthly Sales for Retail Trade and Food Services\", the US Census Bureau publishes estimates of US retail and food services sales. These \"sales\" are orders that have been filled; payment has been made or is an account receivable.\nIn their \"Preliminary Report on Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories and Orders\", the US Census Bureau publishes statistics for \"new orders\", shipments, \"unfilled orders\" and inventories for manufactured durable goods. This gives an indication whether trade is increasing or decreasing for manufactured durable goods in the US.\n\n"}

In 2008 in response to shareholder pressure, PDL spun out its active development programs to a company called Facet Biotech that it capitalized with $400 million.\n\nProtein Design Labs had been founded in 1986 and was a pioneer in humanizing monoclonal antibodies. Its humanization technology was used in several monoclonal antibody drugs under licensing and collaboration agreements; such products included rituximab (Rituxan), bevacizumab (Avastin), and palivizumab (Synagis). It held its initial public offering in 1992 and by 1994 it had 13 compounds in its pipeline, and had partnered its lead product, the humanized monoclonal antibody daclizumab, with Roche under a license that called for a 15% royalty. Daclizumab became the first humanized monoclonal antibody approved for human use in 1997. PDL made another public offering in 2000, at the peak of the biotech IPO window that ran from 1998 to 2001. In 2003 it settled litigation with Genentech over royalty payments owed to PDL under their license agreement; annual royalties were anticipated at that time to be around $90M per year. These are the kinds of intellectual property and license agreements that PDL manages on behalf of its shareholders since 2008; in 2007 those royalty payments were around $220 million.\n\nOne of the development programs that PDL had transferred to Facet was the use of daclizumab in indications it had never licensed to Roche, including multiple sclerosis. Facet partnered that development program with Biogen Idec which attempted a hostile buy out of Facet for $350M in 2009; Facet rejected that offer and was purchased by Abbvie for $450 million in cash the next year. The FDA approved daclizumab for multiple sclerosis in 2016 under the trade name Zinbryta.\n\n"}

{"id": "239850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239850", "title": "Product management", "text": "Product management\n\nProduct management is an organisational lifecycle function within a company dealing with the planning, forecasting, and production, or marketing of a product or products at all stages of the product lifecycle. Similarly, product lifecycle management (PLM) integrates people, data, processes and business systems. It provides product information for companies and their extended supply chain enterprise.\n\nThe role may consist of product development and product marketing, which are different (yet complementary) efforts, with the objective of maximizing sales revenues, market share, and profit margins. Product management also involves elimination decisions. Product elimination begins with the identification of elimination candidates, proceeds with the consideration of remedial actions, continues with a projection of the impact on the business as a whole if a candidate product is eventually eliminated, and concludes with the implementation stage, where management determines the elimination strategy for an item. The product manager is often responsible for analyzing market conditions and defining features or functions of a product and for overseeing the production of the product. The role of product management spans many activities from strategic to tactical and varies based on the organizational structure of the company. To maximize the impact and benefits to an organization, Product management must be an independent function separate on its own.\n\nWhile involved with the entire product lifecycle, the product management's main focus is on driving new product development. According to the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA), superior and differentiated new products—ones that deliver unique benefits and superior value to the customer—are the number one driver of success and product profitability.\n\nDepending on the company size and history, product management has a variety of functions and roles. Sometimes there is a product manager, and sometimes the role of product manager is shared by other roles. Frequently there is Profit and Loss (P&L) responsibility as a key metric for evaluating product manager performance. In some companies, the product management function is the hub of many other activities around the product. In others, it is one of many things that need to happen to bring a product to market and actively monitor and manage it in-market. In very large companies, the product manager may have effective control over shipment decisions to customers, when system specifications are not being met.\n\nProduct management often serves an inter-disciplinary role, bridging gaps within the company between teams of different expertise, most notably between engineering-oriented teams and commercially oriented teams. For example, product managers often translate business objectives set for a product by Marketing or Sales into engineering requirements (sometimes called a Technical Specification). Conversely, they may work to explain the capabilities and limitations of the finished product back to Marketing and Sales (sometimes called a Commercial Specification). Product managers may also have one or more direct reports who manage operational tasks and/or a change manager who can oversee new initiatives. Manufacturing is separate from the research function, the product manager has the responsibility to bridge the gaps if any exist.\n\nIn most technology companies, most product managers possess knowledge in the following areas: computer science, business, and user experience.\n\n\n\nMany refer to inbound (product development) and outbound (product marketing) functions.\n\nInbound product management (aka inbound marketing) is the \"radar\" of the organization and involves absorbing information like customer research, competitive intelligence, industry analysis, trends, economic signals and competitive activity as well as documenting requirements and setting product strategy.\n\nIn comparison, outbound activities are focused on distributing or pushing messages, training sales people, go to market strategies and communicating messages through channels like advertising, PR and events.\n\nIn many organizations the inbound and outbound functions are performed by the same person.\n\nAs these terms are under discussion, another way of looking at these activities is upstream and downstream product management, where 'upstream' is referring to any activity that helps to define, create, or improve the product, while 'downstream' refers to any activity that promotes the product. This avoids the confusion with the term \"inbound marketing\" which nowadays clearly refers to a way of doing downstream product management, referring to 'making the product accessible', i.e. it can be found by suspects and prospects (compared to 'outbound marketing', where the product is 'pushed' in front of the suspect or prospect). \nThe confusion stems mainly from the mix up between the term \"Marketing\" as a discipline, comprising Product Management, MarCom (Marketing Communications), etc. and using the same term 'Marketing' as a synonym for 'Promotion' or 'advertising', i.e. taking a product to the market (i.e. 'downstream').\n\nIt comes as a surprise that this confusion and ambiguity is hard to understand- because if you name the main (value creating) departments in today's organizations, you can clearly assign to Sales, R&D, Operations, and Marketing their respective core functions and areas of responsibility. The core function of Marketing, that differentiates it from Sales, Operations, and R&D is the ownership of the marketing mix (= 4 P: Product, Place, Price, Promotion). Still, many organizations put under 'Marketing' only Market Communications (MarCom), which is just the operational end of marketing and only a subset of what 'Promotion' comprises. From a Product Management perspective, MarCom is a supporting function (like IT, HR, Controlling etc.). In organizations, where the Product Management is weak or not existent, its tasks are taken over by the other departments (i.e. sales defines the distribution ('Place'), operations defines the prices, R&D defines the product, MarCom decides on the promotion.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "508711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=508711", "title": "Total benefits of ownership", "text": "Total benefits of ownership\n\nTotal benefits of ownership (TBO) is a calculation that tries to summarise the positive effects of the acquisition of a plan. It is an estimate of all the values that will affect a business. It is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and indirect benefits of a product or system. It is used to determine potential Return on Investment (ROI). The usage of TBO may lead to increase in efficiency and productivity of a business, improvements in decision-making or improvements in the workforce. It helps to identify important areas which a business should be focusing on, as well as uncovering the hidden aspects of the decisions made by the firm.\n\nTBO goes beyond the initial purpose or implementation benefit to consider the full benefit of a decision or an asset over its useful life. A TBO analysis often shows there can be a large difference between the short term benefit to the business and its long term benefit. This can include operational cost savings, productivity improvements, enhancements to a business’s ability to compete, greater employee retention, increased brand equity and expanding sales reach. For example, a small company can now have access to the rest of the world's markets without the costs of travel. The decisions made from TBO analysis help adding monetary profit into the company's account.\n\nWhile many companies perform Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis, TBO is considered to be as important as TCO. TCO aims to minimise the total cost of the business, whereas TBO targets the maximum value of the project. Enterprise decision makers often use both methods to estimate the actual value of an investment or strategic venture.\n\nWhen considering a business proposition, the enterprise decision makers always consider other alternatives while deciding whether the original plan is the best. An advantage of using TBO is that it identifies the value of the short term and the long-term benefits of the propositions. This system helps the company to prioritise the importance of each decision. This analysis not only serves as a tool to reduce cost but also as a way to plan the future of the business, in a more detailed and sophisticated way. For example, a company is considering whether to invest in a long-term project, such as infrastructure. TBO will consider whether the long-term benefit may outweigh the short-term benefits of opportunity cost; whether the money spent on investment may have a better alternate purpose, e.g. using the budget to improve training schemes for workers.\n\nThe TBO concept is widely used within the web industry. For example, TBO identifies the benefits of using the Internet in a business. These include the exclusion of fixed cost (i.e. rent), as well as the decreasing cost of online advertisement.\n\nSome of the key elements incorporated in the benefit of ownership within retailing industry. \n\n\n"}
