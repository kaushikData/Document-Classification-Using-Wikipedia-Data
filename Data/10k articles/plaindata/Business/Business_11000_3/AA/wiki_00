His business interests include advertising, corporate training and professional investing.\n\nIn 2008, Khoo was ranked among the top 25 richest Singaporeans under age 40 by The Executive magazine. In the same year, he was conferred the NUS Business School Eminent Business Alumni Award.\n\nKhoo is the director of seven other private companies. He was also a director of the Singapore Health Promotion Board (HPB) from 2009 to 2010. He is a member of the Singapore Chapter of the Young Presidents' Organization, whose membership is available only to business owners below age 50, who run businesses with a minimum annual turnover of US$9 million.\n\nKhoo was born Adam Khoo Yean Ann on 8 April 1974, to Vince Khoo and Betty L. Khoo-Kingsley. At age eight, Khoo was expelled from St Stephen's Primary School for misbehavior, partly due to poor academic results. His parents hunted for a primary school willing to accept him and finally found Ngee Ann Primary School. Due to his poor results at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), he did not qualify to enter any of the six secondary schools his parents had chosen. He eventually enrolled in a government school, Ping Yi Secondary School, where he passed only five out of eight academic subjects and finished 156th out of 160 Secondary 1 Express Stream students.\n\nKhoo's parents and teachers described him back then as capable but lazy, indifferent and addicted to television. He described himself as being totally uninterested in learning (he was frustrated as he felt he could not learn), extremely unmotivated, physically weak and mentally lethargic. His stepsister was a straight-As student in the Gifted Education Programme at Raffles Girls' School while cousins from his close-knit extended family were from the best schools in Singapore. He had poor social skills, did not enjoy reading anything but comics and was addicted to arcade games and TV programs. He tried to join the Scout Movement, but was thrown out six months later for not passing the basic qualifying test, the 'Scout Standard', as he did not bother to try.\n\nIn 1987, when Khoo was 13, his parents enrolled their \"under-achiever\" son for a five-day residential program at Ladyhill Hotel called Super-Teen Camp. The man responsible for spotting Khoo's \"gifted talent\" in Super-Teen was Dr. Ernest Wong, founder, principal consultant and master teacher of Ernesco, the Centre for Motivational Language Learning based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (the Super-Teen Camp is now under Learning Mastery Pte. Ltd.) Dr. Wong's teaching tools incorporated and adapted an American-developed learning technology called neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), as well as whole-brain learning. This was the beginning of Khoo's interest and journey in mastering motivational techniques, which formed the foundation of many of his books and seminars.\n\nWithin three months of the program, Khoo climbed to among the top 18 in his secondary school. He went on to rank among the top 10 in Ping Yi Secondary within a year, topped his school in the GCE 'O' Level examinations with the lowest scoring aggregate, and was the first in Ping Yi Secondary to qualify for the then-top junior college in Singapore, Victoria Junior College. At Victoria Junior College, he was president of the Economics Society and scored three A's for his GCE 'A' Level examinations. He entered the business administration faculty at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and continued his notable academic achievements by making it to the dean's list every year, ranked among the top 1 percent of academic achievers and became a pioneer in the university's Talent Development Programme (TDP), the tertiary equivalent of the gifted education programme for secondary schools. He graduated with an honours degree in business administration from NUS.\n\nAt age 15, Khoo was devouring books on Warren Buffett's investment techniques. While still in secondary school, he formed a mobile disco company with his friends, using his grandmother's house to re-create a disco and charged teenagers who attended a fee. He even took over the job of the deejay that he hired, after studying him. At 16, he began investing most of his time and money to read and undergo training sessions in NLP in the United States. At 17, he became a freelance motivational trainer by visiting schools in Singapore, making the bold proposition of turning the worst students around for no charge in the beginning. Eventually, he started charging S$25 per student for half a day's training.\n\nAfter completing National Service in the Republic of Singapore Air Force at age 21, Khoo went into partnership with three NUS friends and registered an event management company, Creatsoul Entertainment. The company organised hops, jams and other entertainment activities for clients like individuals, companies and organisations at NUS and Nanyang Technological University (NTU). This was later re-registered as Event Gurus Pte Ltd, an event management company.\n\nAt 23, Khoo obtained his licence in NLP in Seattle, Washington. At 24, he became a trainer at SuperTeen, conducting courses for organisations like the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC), Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP), Nanyang Girls' High School and the Universitas Pelita Harapan (UPH) in Jakarta. At 25, Khoo was coaching top insurance agents and marketing managers twice his age on how to boost sales. At this time, his father, Vince Khoo, who owned the advertising agency Adcom, bought out all partners and offered the younger Khoo the opportunity to run it. Within three months, he turned it around from making losses in 1998–1999 to clinching a pitching rate of 80 percent with the first monthly profit, and went on to increase margins by 30%. Their clients have included AIA, Dumex, Mobil (lost during the Exxon merger), Phillip Wain slimming centres, Sobe Fresh Soya Milk, Tabasco, Heinz, Sinsin, Night Safari, Singapore and MobileOne (M1).\n\nAt 26, Khoo earned his first million, from giving motivational training at schools and companies (the most lucrative, earning him up to S$1000 an hour), his entertainment company and shrewd investments in equities, unit trusts and property.\n\nInspired by the book \"Buffettology\", he started dabbling in the stock market while in the army.\n\nAs a conservative and long-term investor, Khoo goes for investments with very low risk and high returns, favouring cash-rich companies with low debts and the potential to consistently increase their earnings. He prefers investing in stocks and options, using a variety of investing strategies including momentum and value investing.\n\nKhoo's portfolio consists of property that he rents out. In 1998, he bought a condominium in East Coast for S$480,000 and rented it out for about S$3,000. He sold it for S$650,000 in 2004. Other properties he owns include a house in East Coast and a condominium at Robertson Quay.\n\nKhoo does not believe in taking on consumer debt and prefers starting businesses with zero capital, paying freelance fees or stocks in the beginning until profit is generated.\n\n"}

{"id": "12156100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12156100", "title": "Body shopping", "text": "Body shopping\n\nBody shopping is the practice of consultancy firms recruiting workers (generally in information technology sector) in order to contract their services out on tactical short to mid-term basis. IT services companies that practice body shopping assert that they provide real services (such as software development) rather than the \"sham\" of merely farming out professionals to overseas companies.\n\nBody shopping in IT originated during the mid-1990s when there was a huge demand for people with mainframe, COBOL and related technology skills to prevent systems being affected by the Y2K bug.\n\nMost specialist Y2K consulting companies operating in the US, Europe, the Middle East, Japan and Australia outsourced their technical manpower requirements to companies operating in India. \n\nDuring the period of 1996-97, such companies operating with India base responded to the heavy demand by recruiting and training local graduates in India specifically for Y2K. Their consultants either worked onshore or offshore at high utilization rates generating huge profit margins and cash reserves. The high-profit margin during this period resulted in fast growth and sufficient assets to invest and expand operations to other IT related business segments post-Y2K.\n\nIn the modern era of IT off-shoring, outsourcing, and cloud computing, it is widely accepted that IT service companies' strategy (especially for those operating with a huge technical manpower base in India) still continue to focus on similar lines. The companies that do body shopping are renowned for training and developing technical skills for a wide range of client base that is of current demand.\nResearchers point out that many Indian companies focus heavily on developing a large pool of human resources with technical skills creating a marketplace to 'buy' technical skills on an hourly or daily basis.\n\nThis led to significant market developments in two areas in the early 2000s:\n\n\nAccording to a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services report to Congress, for fiscal year 2012, 59 percent of H-1B visas went to computer-related occupations. The same report also cited that 64 percent of the H-1B visa petitions granted were given to workers originating from India.\n\nBody shopping companies mainly recruit off-shore and provide training to their employees using their off-shore facilities.\n\nEmployment costs (both short-term and permanent) are generally offset by the highly profitable billing ratio, especially for on-site assignments abroad. Most companies boast a utilization rate of 80%, which also takes into account the potentially long 'bench period', where an employee is not billable or when their skills are not in demand.\n\nIn India, traditional body shopping has evolved in its due course post-Y2K era to create strong networking and collaboration between competing Indian body shops working abroad. All body shops claim to have the ability to place Indian workers in almost any country using the resources and services of other Indian body shops operating in the target country.\n\nIn one documented case study deemed as a typical example, a body shop in Hyderabad was able to win a 360 man-month deal with a U.S. company that urgently needed 40 IT workers with a very \"specific\" skill on a 9-month project. Although the Indian body shop company could easily find lower paid workers in India for the job, the H-1B visa process would take too long to bring them into the United States to work. Thus, the Indian firm forwarded a request to its associates' network to locate 40 Indian temporary workers in the United States. A search was undertaken by the network for available Indian H-1B workers, resulting in a list of recently laid-off Indian H-1B workers in the US. Sponsorship for the laid-off Indian H-1B workers was reassigned to a body shop and a portion of the newly employed worker's salary was given as commission to the peer body shop that helped to locate the laid off H-1B workers in their associated peer network of Indian body shops. This process of quickly recruiting available H-1B holders is what is referred to as \"body shopping\".\n\nA similar \"offshoring\" practice started appearing more and more in the 2010 timeframe and which was a practice known as \"nearshoring\". Nearshoring was the practice of hiring mostly IT professionals from Mexico. The outward appearance being the advantage of \"nearshoring\" personnel being within a 2 hour or less time difference to continental U.S. companies opting to use these nearshoring services.\n\n\n"}

The brothers are partly of Greek Cypriot descent, and were estimated to share a joint net worth of £1.5 billion in the \"Estates Gazette\" rich list 2010, placing them at position 52 in the list of the richest property developers in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe brothers were educated at Priory Preparatory School and Epsom College in Surrey. They grew up in Banstead, Surrey, where their father Anthony Candy ran an art studio and a media production company, and their Cypriot mother Patricia was a drama teacher.\n\nWhile Christian was later studying for a business management degree at King's College London, Nick graduated from University of Reading with a degree in Human Geography.\n\nIn 1995, they bought their first property, a one-bedroom flat in Redcliffe Square, Earl's Court, London. Using a £6,000 loan from their grandmother, the brothers renovated the £122,000 apartment while living in it. Eighteen months later they sold it for £172,000, making a £50,000 profit.\n\nIn their spare time between 1995 and 1999, the brothers began renovating flats and working their way up the property ladder. Eventually they were able to give up their day jobs where Nick worked in advertising for J. Walter Thompson and Christian for investment bank Merrill Lynch and established Candy & Candy in 1999, of which Nick is CEO. Nicholas and Christian, who did collaborate on the prestigious One Hyde Park scheme in London, operate separate independent businesses and have done for a number of years. In June 2018, Candy & Candy was renamed Candy Property in order to reinforce Nick Candy’s sole ownership of the business and to align with his wider portfolio of companies. In 2004, Christian established CPC Group in Guernsey, to specialise in high-end residential developments around the world. Some of their more high-profile developments, however, have been in London.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017 they were involved in high-profile litigation in the High Court in London which put their reputations on the line. Mark Holyoake claimed in the High Court action that the Candy Brothers had used threats against him and his family to extort total repayments of £37m against a £12m loan. Although they were cleared of extortion, Mr Justice Nugee said in his judgment \"the protagonists...have been willing to lie when they consider their commercial interests justify them doing so\". Mr Justice Nugee went on to say \"\"he had found none of Mr Holyoake’s claims to be true, and that there had been no undue duress, influence, intimidation or unlawful interference with economic interests.”\" In June 2018, following another application by Mr. Holyoake, the Court of Appeal rejected Mark Holyoake’s bid challenging the high-profile high court ruling in December 2017 (above). Lord Justice David Richards concluded that Mr Holyoake’s arguments had “no real prospect of success” meaning Mr Justice Nugee’s original decision in 2017 was affirmed.\n\nIn recent years Nick Candy has diversified his interests outside of real estate and developed a portfolio of global investments (often in high tech, leading edge technology) through his private investment fund Candy Ventures. Candy Ventures, alongside Qualcomm Ventures was reported to have led a $37 million funding round for leading augmented reality and computer vision company Blippar. \n\nIn 2004, the brothers sought an investment partner to help them buy the site of Bowater House in Knightsbridge, with plans to demolish it and construct 86 luxury apartments.\n\nAfter setting up a joint venture with Waterknights – a private company owned by the Prime Minister of Qatar – they purchased the site from Land Securities in 2005 for £150m.\n\nThey then hired the architect Richard Rogers to design the exterior, and used their own Candy & Candy to handle interior design. One Hyde Park: The Residences of Mandarin Oriental, London, was constructed in four years after obtaining planning permission in 2006, with the finished development housing three commercial units: Rolex, McLaren Automotive and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank. Despite its name, the building’s address is located at 68-114 Knightsbridge, London.\n\nThe One Hyde Park development officially launched in January 2011 and had a profound effect on the global real estate market, breaking a number of industry records as the most expensive residential development in the world. It was reported that the penthouse apartments alone fetched some of the highest prices on record.\n\nIn October 2018, it was reported that Nick Candy refinanced his penthouse at One Hyde Park with an £80 million mortgage from Credit Suisse in order to pursue rental opportunities. The property is reportedly valued at £160 million.  \nIn 2006, the site of the former Middlesex Hospital was purchased for £175m by Project Abbey (Guernsey) Holdings Ltd – an investment consortium which included Kaupthing Bank, the now defunct Icelandic bank, and was led by the Candy’s CPC Group. In February 2007, the brothers applied to Westminster City Council for planning permission to redevelop the 1.2 hectare (3 acre) site into a mixed use development of several hundred new residential units and office space. The plans were met with strong criticism from local residents over the Candy’s choice of NoHo Square as the name for the new development.\n\nPlanning permission for NoHo Square was granted in November 2007; however, the completion of demolition of the hospital in 2008 coincided with the collapse of Kaupthing as a result of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Kaupthing was the largest shareholder in the Guernsey-based consortium which bought the Middlesex site from University College Hospital in 2006, and with the bank in administration, the NoHo Square development stalled. As a result of CPC Group being partners with Kaupthing in another property development over in the US, the Candy brothers were able to transfer their equity stake in NoHo Square to the bank and in exchange take full control of the US development.\n\nIn April 2007, the Candy brothers acquired the Chelsea Barracks in a joint venture with Qatari Diar, part of the Qatar government's investment arm. In what is believed to be Britain's costliest residential property deal, the Candy brothers and the Qatari government have bought the 12.8-acre site from the Ministry of Defence for £959m.\n\nIn April 2007, the Candy brothers purchased – through CPC Group – an eight-acre site in Beverly Hills, California, known as 9900 Wilshire, with their equity partners Kaupthing for a reported £250m.\n\nCPC Group hired architect Richard Meier to design a condominium and retail complex in place of the former Robinsons-May department store. Victor Bardack of the Beverly Hills North Homeowners Association said: \"To put two huge projects on the already-impacted intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards is grossly detrimental to the community,[...] It'll be gridlock forever.\" The controversy stemmed from the Sheikh being part owner of a Middle Eastern newspaper that has been accused of being anti-Semitic and anti-American.\n\nCPC Group served a written notice of default on Kaupthing shortly after. In the same month, the situation was made worse when the acquisition loan to the project from Credit Suisse became past due, and, additionally, it became increasingly difficult to get financing on the 250 condominiums that the original plans catered for. This was due to the collapse of the property market and banks pulling their funding. It was later reported that CPC Group – after negotiating full control of the development from Kaupthing – defaulted on a US$365.5 million bank loan.\n\nChristian wed Emily Crompton, socialite and former nightclub hostess, in a lavish ceremony in 2010. They had twins in 2013, Isabella Monaco Evanthia and Cayman Charles Wolf. They live between UK and Monaco.\n\nOn 29 September 2012, Nick wed the Australian actress-musician-TV presenter Holly Valance in Beverly Hills, California. In November 2013, they had their first child in London, a daughter, Luka Violet Toni Candy.\n\n"}

Companies take various forms, such as:\n\n\nA company or association of persons can be created at law as a legal person so that the company in itself can accept limited liability for civil responsibility and taxation incurred as members perform (or fail to discharge) their duty within the publicly declared \"\"birth certificate\"\" or published policy.\n\nCompanies as legal persons may associate and register themselves collectively as other companies – often known as a corporate group. When a company closes, it may need a \"\"death certificate\"\" to avoid further legal obligations.\n\nA company can be defined as an \"artificial person\", invisible, intangible, created by or under law, with a discrete legal personality, perpetual succession, and a common seal. It is not affected by the death, insanity, or insolvency of an individual member.\n\nThe English word \"company\" has its origins in the Old French military term \"compagnie\" (first recorded in 1150), meaning a \"body of soldiers\", which came from the Late Latin word \"companio\" (\"one who eats bread with you\"), first attested in the \"Lex Salica\" as a calque of the Germanic expression \"gahlaibo\" (literally, \"with bread\"), relGerman]] \"galeipo\" (\"companion\") and Gothic \"gahlaiba\" (\"messmate\"). By 1303, the word referred to trade guilds. Usage of the term \"company\" to mean \"business association\" was first recorded in 1553, and the abbreviation \"co.\" dates from 1769.\n\nIn English law and in legal jurisdictions based upon it, a company is a body corporate or corporation company registered under the Companies Acts or similar legislation.\nCommon forms include:\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a partnership is not legally a company, but may sometimes be referred to informally as a company. It may be referred to as a firm.\n\nIn the United States, a company may be a \"corporation, partnership, association, joint-stock company, trust, fund, or organized group of persons, whether incorporated or not, and (in an official capacity) any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, or similar official, or liquidating agent, for any of the foregoing\".

In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include \"segregated portfolio companies\" and restricted purpose companies.\n\nThere are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.\n\nCompanies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between public companies and private companies. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares.

{"id": "8703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8703", "title": "Darwin Awards", "text": "Darwin Awards\n\nThe Darwin Awards are a tongue-in-cheek honor, originating in Usenet newsgroup discussions around 1985. They recognize individuals who have supposedly contributed to human evolution by selecting themselves out of the gene pool via death or sterilization by their own actions.\n\nThe project became more formalized with the creation of a website in 1993, and followed up by a series of books starting in 2000, authored by Wendy Northcutt. The criterion for the awards states, \"In the spirit of Charles Darwin, the Darwin Awards commemorate individuals who protect our gene pool by making the ultimate sacrifice of their own lives. Darwin Award winners eliminate themselves in an extraordinarily idiotic manner, thereby improving our species' chances of long-term survival.\"\n\nAccidental self-sterilization also qualifies; however, the site notes: \"Of necessity, the award is usually bestowed posthumously.\" The candidate is disqualified, though, if \"innocent bystanders\", who might have contributed positively to the gene pool, are killed in the process.\n\nThe Darwin Awards books state that an attempt is made to disallow known urban legends from the awards, but some older \"winners\" have been \"grandfathered\" to keep their awards. The Darwin Awards site does try to verify all submitted stories, but many similar sites, and the vast number of circulating \"Darwin awards\" emails, are largely fictional.\n\nThe origin of the Darwin Awards can be traced back to posts on Usenet group discussions as early as 1985. An early post, on August 7, 1985, describes the awards as being, \"given posthumously to people who have made the supreme sacrifice to keep their genes out of our pool. Style counts, not everyone who dies from their own stupidity can win.\" This early post cites an example of a person who pulled a vending machine over his head and was crushed to death trying to break into it. Another widely distributed early story mentioning the Darwin Awards is the JATO Rocket Car, which describes a man who strapped a jet-assisted take-off unit to his Chevrolet Impala in the Arizona desert and who died on the side of a cliff as his car achieved speeds of . This story was later confirmed to be an urban legend by the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The official Darwin Awards website run by Northcutt does its best to confirm all stories submitted, listing them as, \"confirmed true by Darwin.\" Many of the viral emails circulating the Internet, however, are hoaxes and urban legends.\n\nThe website and collection of books were started in 1993 by Wendy Northcutt, who at the time was a graduate in molecular biology from the University of California, Berkeley. She went on to study neurobiology at Stanford University, doing research on cancer and telomerase. In her spare time, she organized chain letters from family members into the original Darwin Awards website hosted in her personal account space at Stanford. She eventually left the bench in 1998 and devoted herself full-time to her website and books in September 1999. By 2002, the website received 7 million page hits per month.\n\nShe encountered some difficulty in publishing the first book, since most publishers would only offer her a deal if she agreed to remove the stories from the Internet. Northcutt refused to do so, saying, \"It was a community! I could not do that. Even though it might have cost me a lot of money, I kept saying no.\" She eventually found a publisher who agreed to print a book containing only 10% of the material gathered for the website. The first book turned out to be a success, and was listed on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list for six months.\n\nNot all of the feedback from the stories Northcutt published was positive, and she occasionally received email from people who knew the deceased. One such person wrote, \"This is horrible. It has shocked our community to the core. You should remove this.\" But Northcutt said \"I can't. It's just too stupid.\" Northcutt kept the stories on the website and in her books, citing them as a \"funny-but-true safety guide\", and mentioning that children who read the book are going to be much more careful around explosives.\n\nThe website also recognizes, with Honorable Mentions, individuals who survive their misadventures with their reproductive capacity intact. One example of this is Lawnchair Larry, who attached helium-filled weather balloons to a lawn chair and floated far above Long Beach, California, in July 1982. He reached an altitude of but survived, to be later fined for crossing controlled airspace. Another notable honorable mention was given to the two men who attempted to burgle the home of footballer Duncan Ferguson (who had four convictions for assault and had served six months in Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison) in 2001, with one burglar requiring three days' hospitalization after being confronted by the player.\nA 2014 study published in the British Medical Journal found that between 1995 and 2014 males represented 88.7% of Darwin Award winners (see figure).\n\nA 2006 comedy film, \"The Darwin Awards\", written and directed by Finn Taylor, was based on the website and many of the Darwin Awards stories.\n\nNorthcutt has stated five requirements for a Darwin Award:\n\nThis may be subject to dispute. Potential awardees may be out of the gene pool because of age; others have already reproduced before their deaths. To avoid debates about the possibility of in-vitro fertilization, artificial insemination, or cloning, the original Darwin Awards book applied the following \"deserted island\" test to potential winners: If the person were unable to reproduce when stranded on a deserted island with a fertile member of the opposite sex, he or she would be considered sterile. Winners of the award, in general, either are dead or have become unable to use their sexual organs.\n\nThe candidate's foolishness must be unique and sensational, likely because the award is intended to be funny. A number of foolish but common activities, such as smoking in bed, are excluded from consideration. In contrast, self-immolation caused by smoking after being administered a flammable ointment in a hospital and specifically told not to smoke is grounds for nomination. One \"Honorable Mention\" (a man who attempted suicide by swallowing nitroglycerine pills, and then tried to detonate them by running into a wall) is noted to be in this category, despite being intentional and self-inflicted (i.e. attempted suicide), which would normally disqualify the inductee.\n\nKilling a friend with a hand grenade would not be eligible, but killing oneself while manufacturing a homemade chimney-cleaning device from a grenade would be eligible. To earn a Darwin Award, one must have killed oneself, or rendered oneself sterile; merely causing death to a third party is insufficient.\n\nThe nominee must be at least past the legal driving age and free of mental defect (Northcutt considers injury or death caused by mental defect to be tragic, rather than amusing, and routinely disqualifies such entries). After much discussion, a small category regarding deaths below this age limit also exists. Entry into this category requires that the peers of the candidate be of the opinion that the actions of the person in question were above and beyond the limits of reason.\n\nHowever, in 2011, the awards targeted a 16-year-old boy in Leeds who died stealing copper wiring (the standard minimum driving age in Great Britain being 17). In 2012, Northcutt made similar light of a 14-year-old girl in Brazil who was killed while leaning out of a school bus window; however, she was \"disqualified\" for the award itself because of the likely public objection due to the girl's age, which Northcutt asserts is based on \"magical thinking\".\n\nThe story must be documented by reliable sources: e.g., reputable newspaper articles, confirmed television reports, or responsible eyewitnesses. If a story is found to be untrue, it is disqualified, but particularly amusing ones are placed in the urban legend section of the archives. Despite this requirement, many of the stories are fictional, often appearing as \"original submissions\" and presenting no further sources than unverified (and unreliable) \"eyewitnesses\". Most such stories on Northcutt's Darwin Awards site are filed in the Personal Accounts section.\n\nIn addition, later revisions to the qualification criteria add several requirements that have not been made into formalized 'rules': innocent bystanders cannot be in danger, and the qualifying event 'must' be caused without deliberate intent (to prevent glory-seekers from purposely injuring themselves solely to win a Darwin).\n\n\n"}

Martin (April 19, 1930 – October 2, 2012) was an American advertising executive. In 1965, Martin and his business partner, George Woltz, co-founded The Martin Agency, an advertising agency headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Martin also created the iconic tourism advertising slogan, \"Virginia is for Lovers\", to market the U.S. state of Virginia as a tourist destination. In 2012, \"Advertising Age\" called \"Virginia is for Lovers\", which was first unveiled in 1969, \"one of the most iconic ad campaigns in the past 50 years.\" The advertising campaign is still used by Virginia as of 2016.\n\nMartin was born in Tucson, Arizona, on April 19, 1930. His father, Hawley Phillips Martin, worked as the director of advertising and communications for the Southern States Cooperative and later became the Richmond branch of a Washington D.C. ad agency. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School in Richmond. Martin obtained his bachelor's degree in social science in 1952 from Hampden–Sydney College in Hampden Sydney, Virginia.\n\nMartin's career after college began as an editorial cartoonist for a newspaper published once a week. He then joined the staff of VanSant Dugdale, an ad agency based in Baltimore, where he drew storyboards and wrote scripts for television commercials. He briefly worked in New York City during his early career, where he worked as a television producer, creating live content for \"The Today Show\" and \"The Tonight Show\" on NBC.\n\nHe moved back to Richmond, Virginia, in 1956 to take a position with Cargill & Wilson. Martin was promoted to partner and vice president of account services within the company.\n\nMartin and business partner, George Woltz, founded their ad agency, Martin & Woltz, in 1965. In 1975, Martin and Woltz agreed to divide the firm, which Martin renamed The Martin Agency. His company Martin's until 1986, when The Martin Agency was sold to Scali, McCabe, Sloves. (In turn, Scali, McCabe, Sloves was later acquired by the Interpublic Group of Companies). David Martin retired from The Martin Agency in 1988, two years after selling the ad agency.\n\nMartin is perhaps best known as the \"brainchild\" behind the famous \"Virginia is for Lovers\" tourism campaign, which was first launched in 1969. He was a member of the team which created the slogan. Martin publicly credited Robin McLaughlin, an advertising copyeditor, with writing the original tagline, \"Virginia is for history lovers.\" Martin approved of McLaughlin's work, but suggested that they omit the word \"history\" from the slogan. The rest of the advertising team agreed with Martin's suggestion, leading to the iconic \"Virginia is for Lovers\" campaign.\n\nHe remained in advertising after leaving The Martin Agency. He soon opened a new agency, Hawley Martin Partners, with his brother, Stephen H. \"Steve\" Martin. The firm was named for their father. Martin served the agency's creative plans director and chairman, while Steve Martin was the company's president and CEO. Interpublic Group acquired Hawley Martin Partners in 1993. Interpublic merged it with Fahlgren and renamed the new agency, which was based in Atlanta, as Fahlgren Martin. Fahlgren Martin was next purchased by Arnold Worldwide in 1995, which combined it Finnegan & Agee, another acquisition, to create Arnold Finnegan Martin. \n\nWhile Martin largely retired from advertising in 1995 to pursue writing and painting, he continued to partner with his sons for other ventures. In 1999, Martin co-founded and served as the chairman of Martin Branding Worldwide with his son, Rob Martin. One year later, Martin launched another company, BrandSync, with his younger son, Dave H. Martin, in 2000.\n\nHe also served as a regional head for Associated Actors and Artistes of America (4As), a performing arts trade union federation.\n\nMartin died from cancer on October 2, 2012, at the age of 82. he was survived by his wife, Ann Louise; four children - Sarah Martin Herguner, Susan Mitchell, Robert Martin and David Martin; and nine grandchildren.\n\nMartin received many awards and recognitions during his career. The Richmond Ad Club named him \"Advertising Person of the Year\" in 1969, the same year that the \"Virginia is for Lovers\" ad campaign was launched. Virginia Commonwealth University also inducted him into its Mass Communications Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2012, a portrait of Martin by Louis Briel, an artist from Richmond, was added to the collection of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C.\n\nMartin also pursued writing. He published two books specifically dealing with marketing and branding - \"Romancing the Brand\" and \"Be the Brand: How to Find a Powerful Identity and Use It to Drive Sales.\" He also wrote and released two novels, \"Under a Lemon Moon\" and \"Where the Whores Dance at Midnight.\"\n\nHe also began painting after working with painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell on an ad campaign for Colonial Williamsburg. Martin painted approximately eighty pieces during his life.\n"}
{"id": "10517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10517", "title": "Economies of scale", "text": "Economies of scale\n\nIn microeconomics, economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation (typically measured by amount of output produced), with cost per unit of output decreasing with increasing scale. (In economics, \"scale\" is synonymous with quantity.)\n\nEconomies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a business or manufacturing unit, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale are occurring. If a firm's marginal cost of producing a good or service is beneath its average cost of producing that good or service, then the firm is experiencing economies of scale.\nSome economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a physical or engineering basis.\n\nAnother source of scale economies is the possibility of purchasing inputs at a lower per-unit cost when they are purchased in large quantities.\n\nThe economic concept dates back to Adam Smith and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor. Diseconomies of scale are the opposite.\n\nEconomies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase. Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, pulp and paper industry. A common limit for low cost per unit weight commodities is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship product uneconomical distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.\n\nLarge producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently. They will therefore avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins. Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity grade production to specialty products.\n\nThe simple meaning of economies of scale is doing things more efficiently with increasing size or speed of operation. Economies of scale often rely on fixed costs, which are constant and don't vary with output, and variable costs, which can be affected with the amount of output. In wholesale and retail distribution, increasing the speed of operations, such as order fulfillment, lowers the cost of both fixed and working capital. Other common sources of economies of scale are purchasing (bulk buying of materials through long-term contracts), managerial (increasing the specialization of managers), financial (obtaining lower-interest charges when borrowing from banks and having access to a greater range of financial instruments), marketing (spreading the cost of advertising over a greater range of output in media markets), and technological (taking advantage of returns to scale in the production function). Each of these factors reduces the long run average costs (LRAC) of production by shifting the short-run average total cost (SRATC) curve down and to the right.\n\nEconomies of scale is a practical concept that may explain real-world phenomena such as patterns of international trade or the number of firms in a market. The exploitation of economies of scale helps explain why companies grow large in some industries. It is also a justification for free trade policies, since some economies of scale may require a larger market than is possible within a particular country—for example, it would not be efficient for Liechtenstein to have its own carmaker if they only sold to their local market. A lone carmaker may be profitable, but even more so if they exported cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market. Economies of scale also play a role in a \"natural monopoly\". There is a distinction between two types of economies of scale: internal and external. An industry that exhibits an internal economy of scale is one where the costs of production fall when the number of firms in the industry drops, but the remaining firms increase their production to match previous levels. Conversely, an industry exhibits an external economy of scale when costs drop due to the introduction of more firms, thus allowing for more efficient use of specialized services and machinery. \n\nThe management thinker and translator of the Toyota Production System for service, Professor John Seddon, argues that attempting to create economies by increasing scale is powered by myth in the service sector. Instead, he believes that economies will come from improving the flow of a service, from the first receipt of a customer’s demand to the eventual satisfaction of that demand. In trying to manage and reduce unit costs, firms often raise total costs by creating failure demand. Seddon claims that arguments for an economy of scale are a mix of (a) the plausibly obvious and (b) a little hard data, brought together to produce two broad assertions, for which there is little hard factual evidence.\n\nSome of the economies of scale recognized in engineering have a physical basis, such as the square-cube law, by which the surface of a vessel increases by the square of the dimensions while the volume increases by the cube. This law has a direct effect on the capital cost of such things as buildings, factories, pipelines, ships and airplanes.\n\nIn structural engineering, the strength of beams increases with the cube of the thickness.\n\nDrag loss of vehicles like aircraft or ships generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume, although the physical details can be quite complicated. Therefore, making them larger usually results in less fuel consumption per ton of cargo at a given speed.\n\nHeat losses from industrial processes vary per unit of volume for pipes, tanks and other vessels in a relationship somewhat similar to the square-cube law.\n\nOverall costs of capital projects are known to be subject to economies of scale. A crude estimate is that if the capital cost for a given sized piece of equipment is known, changing the size will change the capital cost by the 0.6 power of the capacity ratio (the point six power rule).\n\nIn estimating capital cost, it typically requires an insignificant amount of labor, and possibly not much more in materials, to install a larger capacity electrical wire or pipe having significantly greater capacity.\n\nThe cost of a unit of capacity of many types of equipment, such as electric motors, centrifugal pumps, diesel and gasoline engines, decreases as size increases. Also, the efficiency increases with size.\n\nOperating crew size for ships, airplanes, trains, etc., does not increase in direct proportion to capacity. (Operating crew consists of pilots, co-pilots, navigators, etc. and does not include passenger service personnel.) Many aircraft models were significantly lengthened or \"stretched\" to increase payload.\n\nMany manufacturing facilities, especially those making bulk materials like chemicals, refined petroleum products, cement and paper, have labor requirements that are not greatly influenced by changes in plant capacity. This is because labor requirements of automated processes tend to be based on the complexity of the operation rather than production rate, and many manufacturing facilities have nearly the same basic number of processing steps and pieces of equipment, regardless of production capacity.\n\nKarl Marx noted that large scale manufacturing allowed economical use of products that would otherwise be waste. Marx cited the chemical industry as an example, which today along with petrochemicals, remains highly dependent on turning various residual reactant streams into salable products. In the pulp and paper industry it is economical to burn bark and fine wood particles to produce process steam and to recover the spent pulping chemicals for conversion back to a usable form.\n\nEconomies of scale is related to and can easily be confused with the theoretical economic notion of returns to scale. Where economies of scale refer to a firm's costs, returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long-run (all inputs variable) production function. A production function has \"constant\" returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion. Returns are \"decreasing\" if, say, doubling inputs results in less than double the output, and \"increasing\" if more than double the output. If a mathematical function is used to represent the production function, and if that production function is homogeneous, returns to scale are represented by the degree of homogeneity of the function. Homogeneous production functions with constant returns to scale are first degree homogeneous, increasing returns to scale are represented by degrees of homogeneity greater than one, and decreasing returns to scale by degrees of homogeneity less than one.\n\nIf the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, and thus the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases, then it can be shown that at a particular level of output, the firm has economies of scale if and only if it has increasing returns to scale, has diseconomies of scale if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale, and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale. In this case, with perfect competition in the output market the long-run equilibrium will involve all firms operating at the minimum point of their long-run average cost curves (i.e., at the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale).\n\nIf, however, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets, then the above conclusions are modified. For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels. Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.\n\nThe literature assumed that due to the competitive nature of reverse auctions, and in order to compensate for lower prices and lower margins, suppliers seek higher volumes to maintain or increase the total revenue. Buyers, in turn, benefit from the lower transaction costs and economies of scale that result from larger volumes. In part as a result, numerous studies have indicated that the procurement volume must be sufficiently high to provide sufficient profits to attract enough suppliers, and provide buyers with enough savings to cover their additional costs.\n\nHowever, surprisingly enough, Shalev and Asbjornse found, in their research based on 139 reverse auctions conducted in the public sector by public sector buyers, that the higher auction volume, or economies of scale, did not lead to better success of the auction. They found that auction volume did not correlate with competition, nor with the number of bidders, suggesting that auction volume does not promote additional competition. They noted, however, that their data included a wide range of products, and the degree of competition in each market varied significantly, and offer that further research on this issue should be conducted to determine whether these findings remain the same when purchasing the same product for both small and high volumes. Keeping competitive factors constant, increasing auction volume may further increase competition.\n\nIn his 1844 \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts\", Karl Marx observes that economies of scale have historically been associated with an increasing concentration of private wealth and have been used to justify such concentration. Marx points out that concentrated private ownership of large-scale economic enterprises is a historically contingent fact, and not essential to the nature of such enterprises. In the case of agriculture, for example, Marx calls attention to the sophistical nature of the arguments used to justify the system of concentrated ownership of land:\n\nInstead of concentrated private ownership of land, Marx recommends that economies of scale should instead be realized by associations:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "210311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210311", "title": "Esso", "text": "Esso\n\nEsso (stylized as Ɛsso) is a trading name for ExxonMobil and its related companies. The name is the phonetic pronunciation of the initials 'S' and 'O' in the name Standard Oil. The company began as Standard Oil of New Jersey following the breakup of Standard Oil. In 1972, the name was largely replaced in the U.S. by the Exxon brand after the company bought Humble Oil, while the Esso name remained widely used elsewhere.\n\nIn most of the world, the Esso brand and the Mobil brand are the primary brand names of ExxonMobil, with the Exxon brand name still in use only in the United States alongside Mobil.\n\nIn 1911, Standard Oil was broken up into 34 companies, some of which were named \"Standard Oil\" and had the rights to that brand in certain states (the other companies had no territorial rights). Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) (\"Jersey Standard\") had the rights in that state, plus in Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia. By 1941, it had also acquired the rights in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Louisiana. In those states, it marketed its products under the brand \"Esso\", the acronym for \"Eastern States Standard Oil\".\n\nIt also used the Esso brand in New York and the six New England states, where the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony-Vacuum, later Socony Mobil) had the rights, but did not object to the New Jersey company's use of the trademark (the two companies did not merge until November 1999). However, in the other states, the other Standard Oil companies objected and, via a 1937 U.S. federal court injunction, forced Jersey Standard to use other brand names. In most states the company used the trademark Enco (\"Energy Company\"), and in a few \"Humble\".\n\nThe other Standard companies likewise were \"Standard\" or some variant on that in their home states, and another brand name in other states. Esso ranked 31st among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts.\n\nDuring the years of racial segregation in the United States, certain Esso franchises gave out \"The Negro Motorist Green Book: An International Travel Guide\". In 1973, Standard Oil of New Jersey renamed itself as the Exxon Corporation, and adopted that trademark throughout the country. It maintained the rights to \"Standard\" and \"Esso\" in the states where it held those rights, by a token effort, by selling \"Esso Diesel\" in those states at stations that sell diesel fuel, thus preventing the trademark from being declared abandoned.\n\nIt retained the \"Esso\" brand in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands until 2008, when it sold its stations there to Total S.A.\n\nThe Enco brand name was used on locations in the Midwest until 1977 when they were sold to Cheker Oil Co. (now part of Marathon Petroleum subsidiary Speedway LLC); Exxon continues to have a presence in southern Ohio today (as it does throughout much of Appalachia in general), though Mobil is the company's primary brand in the Midwest.\n\nIn February 2016, ExxonMobil successfully asked a U.S. federal court to lift the 1930s trademark injunction that banned it from using the Esso brand in certain states. By this time, as a result of numerous mergers and rebranding, the remaining Standard Oil companies that previously objected to the Esso name had been acquired by BP.\n\nExxonMobil cited trademark surveys in which there was no longer possible confusion with the Esso name as it was more than seven decades before. BP also had no objection to lift the ban.\n\nExxonMobil did not specify whether they would now open new stations in the U.S. under the Esso name; they were primarily concerned about the additional expenses of having separate marketing, letterheads, packaging, and other materials that omit \"Esso\".\n\nIn 1888, the Anglo American Oil Company opened its head office in London, which eventually became a part of Esso. In August 1998, Tesco announced a partnership with Esso, opening chains of Tesco Express stores located within forecourts, which continues today. In February 2000, the two companies were opening one new store a month, creating 4,000 jobs.\nEsso Blue was the brand name of Esso's paraffin oil (kerosene) for domestic heaters in countries such as the United Kingdom. Their television advertising song from the 1950s, through to the 1970s, was the famous \"Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Esso Blue!\"\n\nOne campaign used the well-known song tune of \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" reworded as: \"They asked me how I knew, it was Esso Blue, I of course replied, with lower grades one buys, smoke gets in your eyes. The non-smoking paraffin\".\nThe track was released as a flexi disk which was given away free in hardware stores.\n\nIn the 1930s, Esso acquired Cleveland, an independent company based in North East England. The name comes from the fact that the founder and principal shareholder, Norman Davis, spent some of World War I with his brother Manuel in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland's products included a benzole blend and an alcohol blend called \"Discol\". The Esso and Cleveland names continued in use until 1973, when the Cleveland filling stations were re-branded as Esso.\n\nEsso traded in Northern Ireland up until the early 2000s. Their forecourts were re-branded as Maxol and some remained private.\n\n45 of Euro Garages' forecourts were bought from Esso in 2013, and are operated under the Esso brand. They plan to roll out partner brands such as Starbucks and Spar, replacing the Esso branded shops.\n\nShop and Drive is an Esso branded convenience store operated in some stations, although many of their locations have franchised shops such as Nisa.\n\nIn Canada, the Esso brand is used on stations operated by Imperial Oil, which is 69.8% owned by ExxonMobil. Esso also provides aviation fuel services at 80 airport locations in Canada (Aviation and Avitat).\n\nIn Australia, Esso is an affiliate of ExxonMobil, it operates oil and gas production. Its retail petrol stations were acquired by Mobil Australia in 1990.\n\nEstablished as Esso Standard Oil (Japan) in 1962 with Standard Vacuum division in Japan. It became Esso Oil in 1982. After the Exxon and Mobil merger in 1999, the Japanese subsidiaries were reorganized as ExxonMobil Y.K. in 2002, later renamed to EMG Marketing in 2012 and acquired as a subsidiary by TonenGeneral Oil in the same year. In 2016 JX Holdings and the TonenGeneral Group merged into JXTG Holdings, leading to the dissolution and absorption of EMG Marketing into a subsidiary of the new company, JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy, in 2017. As a result, ExxonMobil's Esso and Mobil brands are planned to be migrated to JX's ENEOS brand in 2019.\n\nEsso is ExxonMobil's primary gasoline brand worldwide except in Australia, Guam, Mexico (starting in about the first quarter of 2018), Nigeria and New Zealand, where the Mobil brand is used exclusively. In Canada (since 2017), Colombia, Egypt, Japan (until 2020) and formerly Malaysia, both the Esso and Mobil brands are used. While Esso and Mobil in Malaysia were rebranded as Petron in 2013, Esso and Mobil in Japan will be rebranded as ENEOS in 2020, since the acquisition of Esso and Mobil from JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy in 2017.\n\nMobil is ExxonMobil's primary retail gasoline brand in California, Florida, New York, New England, the Great Lakes and the Midwest. Exxon is the primary brand in the rest of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states.\n\nIn the 1960s, campaigns featuring heavy spending in different mass media channels became more prominent. Esso spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a brand awareness campaign built around the simple and alliterative theme \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\". Psychologist Ernest Dichter and DDB Worldwide copywriter Sandy Sulcer learned that motorists desired both power and play while driving, and chose the tiger as an easy to remember symbol to communicate those feelings.\n\nThe North American and later European campaign featured extensive television and radio and magazine ads, including photos with tiger tails supposedly emerging from car gas tanks, in England there were faux tiger tails with pink ribbons to tie round underneath the cap of the petrol tank so as to look as if there was a tiger in the tank: these were often seen on the road in the 1960s; at one time in England there was a television advertisement where a sombre man labelled as the advertising manager said that they were no longer going to have the tiger, followed a short while later with advertisements for the save the tiger campaign, promotional events featuring real tigers, billboards, and in Europe station pump hoses \"wrapped in tiger stripes\" as well as pop music songs. Tiger imagery can still be seen on the pumps of successor firm ExxonMobil.\n\nEsso, along with its sister brands Exxon and Mobil, are official long-term recommended gasoline of Porsche, Bentley, Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu, Hino, Chevrolet (including Corvette), Cadillac, Opel, Vauxhall, Buick, Holden, Mercedes-Benz (until 2015, now fully switched to Petronas in 2016) and Perodua for automobiles and also Honda for both automobiles and motorcycles.\n"}

However, with the escalation of World War II in 1942, he was drafted into the Astronomical Department of the Navigation Institute of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nAfter the war, in 1948 he joined the Ministry of Public Health and Welfare, where he came under the influence of eminent statistician Matosaburo Masuyama, who kindled his interest in the design of experiments. He also worked at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics during this time, and supported experimental work on the production of penicillin at Morinaga Pharmaceuticals, a Morinaga Seika company.\n\nIn 1950, he joined the Electrical Communications Laboratory (ECL) of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation just as statistical quality control was beginning to become popular in Japan, under the influence of W. Edwards Deming and the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers. ECL was engaged in a rivalry with Bell Labs to develop cross bar and telephone switching systems, and Taguchi spent his twelve years there in developing methods for enhancing quality and reliability. Even at this point, he was beginning to consult widely in Japanese industry, with Toyota being an early adopter of his ideas.\n\nDuring the 1950s, he collaborated widely and in 1954-1955 was visiting professor at the Indian Statistical Institute, where he worked with C. R. Rao, Ronald Fisher and Walter A. Shewhart. While working at the SQC Unit of ISI, he was introduced to the orthogonal arrays invented by C. R. Rao - a topic which was to be instrumental in enabling him to develop the foundation blocks of what is now known as Taguchi methods.\n\nOn completing his doctorate at Kyushu University in 1962, he left ECL, though he maintained a consulting relationship. In the same year he visited Princeton University under the sponsorship of John Tukey, who arranged a spell at Bell Labs, his old ECL rivals. In 1964 he became professor of engineering at Aoyama Gakuin University, Tokyo. In 1966 he began a collaboration with Yuin Wu, who later emigrated to the U.S. and, in 1980, invited Taguchi to lecture. During his visit there, Taguchi himself financed a return to Bell Labs, where his initial teaching had made little enduring impact. This second visit began a collaboration with Madhav Phadke and a growing enthusiasm for his methodology in Bell Labs and elsewhere, including Ford Motor Company, Boeing, Xerox and ITT.\n\nSince 1982, Genichi Taguchi has been an advisor to the Japanese Standards Institute and executive director of the American Supplier Institute, an international consulting organisation. His concepts pertaining to experimental design, the loss function, robust design, and the reduction of variation have influenced fields beyond product design and manufacturing, such as sales process engineering.\n\nTaguchi has made a very influential contribution to industrial statistics. Key elements of his quality philosophy include the following:\n\n\n\n"}

Gannon played a significant and leading role in the build-up and demise of the Irish property bubble. Gannon was at the centre of the Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy, which was a contributing element in the development of the post-2008 Irish banking crisis.\n\nGannon is a native of County Roscommon. Married to Margaret, the couple had one son and four daughters. Their daughter Emma died aged 6, whilst their adult son Peter died on 8 July 2013.\n\nGannon started his builder activities in the 1980s in London while working for his father's construction firm. Gannon and Michael Smurfit jointly owned the Kildare Hotel and Golf Club, known as the K Club, until Smurfit purchased Gannon's 49% stake for €40 million in 2012 via NAMA.\n\nIn 1986, through the firm Structural Developments Ltd build at Castle Village in Celbridge. In 1988 through another firm – Noteworthy Limited – with partner Michael Anglim, Gannon planned to build 710 houses at Brackenstown close to Swords. At the time it was one of the largest schemes submitted to Dublin County Council. Permission was granted for the scheme in October 1988. The scheme at the time was said to be worth upwards of £40 million. The site on which the houses were built was bought by Noteworthy Ltd as a parcel of land in 1987. The land was zoned for residential purposes in 1983 against the recommendation of the Council’s planning officials. In April 1990, Gannon, now trading through Gannon Homes, sought permission for a £70 m residential scheme and a shopping centre on a 110-acre site on the Malahide road. The scheme involved 915 houses on a 95-acre site fronting the Malahide Road and the Hole in the Wall road at Ayrfield. They also lodged planning applications for a drive-in restaurant, a pub and a library. The firm bought the land from two sites. The 95 acres were bought from Abbey Group and the 15-acre site was the site of the former Clare Manor Hotel.\n\nGannon has owned Ericsson R&D facility in Athlone, County Westmeath for several years. In 2017 it was reported that it would be offered for sale for more than €19m.\n\nThe 'Maple 10', also known as the Anglo 10 or the Golden Circle, was a group of Irish investors. The Maple 10 besides Gerry Gannon include Jackson O'Sullivan, John McCabe, Paddy McKillen, Jerry Conlan, Joe O’Reilly, Patrick Kearney, Brian O’Farrell, Gerry Maguire and Sean Reilly. The Irish Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) examines the file on Anglo's \"Maple 10\" deals.\n\nAs reported by the Irish Independent newspapers on 20 February 2011, \"a portfolio of properties worth about €12m was transferred into the name of developer Gerry Gannon's wife, Margaret, between 21 May and 10 December 2009\".\n"}

Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. These incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an incident response team (IRT), an incident management team (IMT), or Incident Command System (ICS). Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.\n\nAn incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions. Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. If not managed, an incident can escalate into an emergency, crisis or a disaster. Incident management is therefore the process of limiting the potential disruption caused by such an event, followed by a return to business as usual. Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.\n\nIncident management is considered to be much more than just the analysis of perceived threats and hazards towards and organization in order to work out the risk of that event occurring, and therefore the ability of that organization to conduct business as usual activities during the incident. An important part of risk management process and business resilience planning that Incident management is a real time physical activity.\n\nThe planning that has happened to formulate the response to an incident—be that a disaster, emergency, crisis or accident—has been done so that effective business resilience can take place to ensure minimal loss or damage whether that is to tangible or non tangible assets of that organization. Efficient physical management of the incident—making best use of both time and resources that are available and understanding how to get more resources from outside the organization when needed by clear and timely liaison—ensure the plan is implemented.\n\nNational Fire Protection Association states that incident management can be described as, '[a]n IMS [incident management system] is \"the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures and communications operating within a common organizational structure, designed to aid in the management of resources during incidents\".\n\nThe physical incident management is the real time response that may last for hours, days, or longer. The United Kingdom Cabinet Office have produced the National Recovery Guidance (NRG), which is aimed at local responders as part of the implementation of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 (CCA). It describes the response as the following: \"Response encompasses the actions taken to deal with the immediate effects of an emergency. In many scenarios, it is likely to be relatively short and to last for a matter of hours or days – rapid implementation of arrangements for collaboration, co-ordination and communication are, therefore, vital. Response encompasses the effort to deal not only with the direct effects of the emergency itself (eg fighting fires, rescuing individuals) but also the indirect effects (eg disruption, media interest)\".\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO), which is the world's largest developer of international standards also makes a point in the description of its risk management, principles and guidelines document ISO 31000:2009 that, \"Using ISO 31000 can help organizations increase the likelihood of achieving objectives, improve the identification of opportunities and threats and effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment\". This again shows the importance of not just good planning but effective allocation of resources to treat the risk.\n\nToday, an important role is played by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), due to the rise of internet crime, and is a common example of incident faced by companies in developed nations all across the world. For example, if an organization discovers that an intruder has gained unauthorized access to a computer system, the CSIRT would analyze the situation, determine the breadth of the compromise, and take corrective action. Computer forensics is one task included in this process. Currently, over half of the world’s hacking attempts on Trans National Corporations (TNCs) take place in North America (57%). 23% of attempts take place in Europe. Having a well-rounded Computer Security Incident Response team is integral to providing a secure environment for any organization, and is becoming a critical part of the overall design of many modern networking teams.\n\nIncidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an incident response team (IRT), or an incident management team (IMT). These are often designated beforehand or during the event, and are placed in control of the organization whilst the incident is dealt with, to restore normal functions.\n\nThe Incident Command System (ICS) is designed to deal with a larger incident involving a respond from multiple agencies. Popular with public safety agencies and jurisdictions in the United States, Canada and other countries, it is growing in practice in the private sector as organizations begin to manage without or co-manage emergencies with public safety agencies. ICS is a command and control mechanism that provides an expandable structure to manage emergency agencies. Although some of the details vary by jurisdiction, ICS normally consists of five primary elements: command, operations, planning, logistics and finance/administration. Several special staff positions, including public affairs, safety, and liaison, report directly to the incident commander (IC) when the emergency warrants establishment of those positions.\n\nAnother response system is the Gold–silver–bronze command structure, which is used by emergency services in the United Kingdom and other countries. The system has three levels of command: a gold commander sets the overall strategy, a silver commander is in direct charge of those at the scene and bronze commanders direct responders on the ground. An individual agency may use the system, or multiple agencies may use the system as they liaise. A common feature of the ICS and Gold-Silver-Bronze systems is that they create a separate command system to the agencies' usual hierarchy.\n\nUsually as part of the wider management process in private organizations, incident management is followed by post-incident analysis where it is determined why the incident happened despite precautions and controls. This analysis is normally overseen by the leaders of the organization, with the view of preventing repetition of the incident through precautionary measures and often changes in policy. This information is then used as feedback to further develop the security policy and/or its practical implementation. In the United States, the National Incident Management System, developed by the Department of Homeland Security, integrates effective practices in emergency management into a comprehensive national framework. This often results in a higher level of contingency planning, exercise and training, as well as an evaluation of the management of the incident.\n\nIncident management software systems are designed for collecting consistent, time sensitive, documented incident report data. Many of these products include features to automate the approval process of an incident report or case investigation. These products may also have the ability to collect real time incident information such as time and date data. Additionally incident report systems will automatically send notifications, assign tasks and escalations to appropriate individuals depending on the incident type, priority, time, status and custom criteria. Modern products provide the ability for administrators to configure the Incident report forms as needed, create analysis reports and set access controls on the data. These incident reports may have the ability for customization that may best suit the organizations using the systems. Some of these products have the ability to collect images, video, audio and other data. Incident management software systems exist that relate directly to specific industries.\n\nDuring the root cause analysis, human factors should be assessed. James Reason conducted a study into the understanding of adverse effects of human factors. The study found that major incident investigations, such as Piper Alpha and Kings Cross Underground Fire, made it clear that the causes of the accidents were distributed widely within and outside the organization. There are two types of events: active failure—an action that has immediate effects and has the likelihood to cause an accident—and latent or delayed action—events can take years to have an effect and are usually combined with triggering events that then cause the accident.\n\nActive failures are unsafe acts (errors and violations) committed by, for instance, the operators of machinery and supervisors of tasks. It is the people at the human-system interface whose actions can have immediate adverse consequences.\n\nLatent failures are created as the result of decisions taken at the higher echelons of an organisation. Their damaging consequences may lie dormant for a long time, only becoming evident when they combine with local triggering factors (e.g., the spring tide, the loading difficulties at Zeebrugge harbour, etc.) to breach the system's defences. Decisions taken in the higher echelons of an organization can trigger the events towards an accident becoming more likely, the planning, scheduling, forecasting, designing, policy making, etc., can have a slow burning effect. The actual unsafe act that triggers an accident can be traced back through the organization and the subsequent failures can be exposed, showing the accumulation of latent failures within the system as a whole that led to the accident becoming more likely and ultimately happening. Better improvement action can be applied, and reduce the likelihood of the event happening again.\n\n\n\n"}

He is also known as the \"Brick King\". He revived the Spa of Busiasch.\n\nHe was born in Nagykikinda (Serbian: \"Velika Kikinda, \"now \"Kikinda\", Serbia), a town in the Banat, in a Banat Swabian family with a long tradition in the production of bricks, however he had Banat French origin. His surname was written as \"Mougeon\" before it got germanized. His grandparents and great-grandparents produced bricks in workshops located at the edge of Lugoj.\n\nAt the age of 20 years he married Margaret Bohn the daughter of a famous German industrialist specialized in the production of tiles and bricks that built the brick factory at Zsombolya (now Jimbolia, Romania) and Gyertyámos (Cărpiniş) and had other several factories in Europe.\n\nAt the age of 20, Muschong and his wife founded the \"M. Bohn & Comp.\" which in 1888 built a brick factory in Lugoj. After several years he built a new plant in Lugoj and bought several factories from his competitors. In 1908 the company changed its name to \"J. Muschong & Comp.\" Muschong brick and tile products were of high quality and were sold throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire and then in Greater Romania. Muschong built more factories in Banat but he also built one at the outskirts of Budapest. In 1910 his company had 357 employees which made it the 23rd biggest employer in the Banat and the biggest in Lugoj.\n\nHe was also the founder of the Buziaş Spa (', '). He bought the bath and the 100 ha forest around it in 1906 from the family of the Hungarian tire manufacturer, Ernő Schottola. He built a bottling hall to produce bottled mineral water under the names \"Phönix\" and \"Muschong\". He also built a carbon acid factory in 1907 for 2 million krones. The main export market for the mineral waters was the Balkan region. The plant had 700 m^2 area where the 700 HP steam engine and 60 HP electric engines provided the driving force. The plant had 36 employees.\n\nHe carried out probing drills, which were successful: the water came from 103 meters deep and it became medically proven that the water was good for gout or gastric lavage. He also laid the beautiful spa gardens with valuable plants, built a 500-meter-long covered walkway, 22 villas for spa guests, a zoo and sports fields. He also raised a hotel in 1922-1923 which he named \"Muschong Hotel\" (now \"Felix Hotel\") after himself. In the same year he built a 2.9 km long railway with a normal gauge (1435 mm) between Buziaş railway station and the spa. According to the 1958 timetable, the journey took 7 minutes between the two stations. (On October 10, 1973 the railway line was dismantled.)\n\nUntil 1948 the spa, the hotels and the bottling plant stayed in the Muschong family's ownership. Then it was nationalized.\n\nAccording to the \"Cégfelszámoló\" (\"Company Directory\") he was named as liquidator of the \"Egyesült magyar kénsavgyárak értékesítő szövetkezete\" (\"United Sulfuric Acid Manufacturers Cooperative\", est. 1909, 11 Ipar utca, District IX, Budapest), shareholder of \"Kőbányai Gőztéglagyár\" (\"Steam Brick Factory of Kőbánya\", est. 1876, 1 Erzsébet-körút, District VII, Budapest) and shareholder of the \"Közönséges tömörfaltéglákat árusító részvénytársaság\" (\"Ordinary Solid Wallbrick Selling plc\", est. 1900, 27 Andrássy út, District VI).\n\nOne of the most emblematic buildings of Lugoj is the \"Timiș Hotel\" which was built in 1926 as the \"Muschong Palace\" and was owned by Jakob Muschong.\n\nIn 1913 he worked as the CEO of \"Ziegel- und Kalkbrennerei AG\" in Budapest while his son, \"Jakab Muschong Jr\" was the manager of Bad Busiasch, co-leader of the \"Ziegel- und Kalkbrennerei AG\" and \"Hatzfelder Dampfziegelei AG\", Zsombolya.\n\nAfter the Great Union of 1918 the Romanian authorities began the persecution of Jacob Muschong, considering that he opposes Romanian capital development. He is teased and persecuted by a broad campaign of denigration by the media. Many financial controls from the authorities followed which discovered accounting irregularities alleged in the statements of income, considering the amounts invested by Muschong as profit and forcing him to pay tax on them.\n\nSoon after, Muschong died in a heart attack on December 13, 1923 at his residence in Lugoj.\n\nAfter his death no one in the family could raise to the level of driving experience and ability that Jacob had. His wealth re-evaluated in today's money would probably amounts to over three billion dollars. All his factories were nationalized by the communists in 1948 and largely demolished. Instead of his largest brick factory located on Timişorii street in Lugoj the communists built the Tiles and Sanitary Equipment Factory \"Mondial\" which was later privatized in 1996 to German investors and still exists today.\n\nHe was married to Margaret Bohn and had two daughters, Margit and Borbála and a son, Jakab. According to the \"Cégfelszámoló\" (\"Company Directory\") his son, Jakab Muschong Jr. had a grenade patron company in 6203 Külső Bécsi út, Budapest, Disctrict III.\n\n"}

First published in 1989, it is considered one of the books that defined Wall Street during the 1980s, along with Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's \"\", and the fictional \"The Bonfire of the Vanities\" by Tom Wolfe. The book captures an important period in the history of Wall Street. Two important figures in that history feature prominently in the text, the head of Salomon Brothers' mortgage department Lewis Ranieri and the firm's CEO John Gutfreund.\n\nThe book's name is taken from liar's poker, a high-stakes gambling game popular with the bond traders in the book.\n\n\"Liar's Poker\" follows two different story threads, though not necessarily in chronological order.\n\nThe first thread is autobiographical, and follows Lewis through his college education and his hiring by Salomon Brothers (now a subsidiary of Citigroup) in 1984. This part of the book gives a first-person account of how bond traders and salesmen truly work, their personalities, and their culture. The book captures well an important period in the history of Wall Street. Important figures in that history feature prominently in the text: John Meriwether, mortgage department head Lewis Ranieri, and firm CEO John Gutfreund.\n\nThe second thread is a history of Salomon Brothers and an overview of Wall Street in general, especially how the firm single-handedly created a market for mortgage bonds that made the firm wealthy, only to be outdone by Michael Milken and his junk bonds. This thread is less dependent on Lewis' personal experience and features quotes apparently drawn from interviews with various relevant figures.\n\nLewis jumps back and forth between these two threads in the book.\n\nLewis was an art history student at Princeton University, who nonetheless wanted to break into Wall Street to make money. He describes his almost pathetic attempts to find a finance job, only to be roundly rejected by every firm to which he applied. For example, in 1982 Lehman Brothers had rejected his employment application. He then enrolled in the London School of Economics to gain a master's degree in economics.\n\nWhile in England, Lewis was invited to a banquet hosted by the Queen Mother, where his cousin, Baroness Linda Monroe von Stauffenberg, one of the organizers of the banquet, purposefully seated him next to the wife of the London managing partner of Salomon Brothers. She hoped that his intelligence might impress her enough for her to suggest to her husband that Lewis, be given a job with Salomon Brothers. The strategy worked, and Lewis was granted an interview and subsequently received a job offer.\n\nLewis then moved to New York City for Salomon's training program. Here, he was appalled at the sophomoric, obtuse and obnoxious behavior of some of his fellow trainees, and indoctrinated into the money culture of Salomon Brothers and the Wall Street culture as a whole.\n\nFrom New York, Lewis was shipped to the London office of Salomon Brothers as a bond salesman. Despite his lack of knowledge, he was soon handling millions of dollars in investment accounts. In 1987, he witnessed a near-hostile takeover of Salomon Brothers but survived with his job. However, growing disillusioned with his work, Lewis quit the firm at the beginning of 1988 to write this book and become a financial journalist. The first edition was published October 17, 1989.\n\nThe book is an unflattering portrayal of Wall Street traders and salesmen, their personalities, their beliefs, and their work practices.\n\nDuring the training sessions, Lewis was struck by the infantilism of most of his fellow trainees. Examples included yelling at and insulting financial experts who talked to them, throwing spit balls at one another and at lecturers, calling phone sex lines and then broadcasting them over the company's intercom, gambling on behavioral traits (such as how long it took certain trainees to fall asleep during lectures), and the trainees' incredible lust for money and contempt for any position that did not earn that much.\n\nLewis attributed the bond traders' and salesmen's behavior to the fact that the trading floor required neither finesse nor advanced financial knowledge, but, rather, the ability and desire to exploit others' weaknesses, to intimidate others into listening to traders and salesmen, and the ability to spend hours a day screaming orders under high pressure situations. He referred to their worldview as \"The Law of the Jungle.\"\n\nHe also noted that, although most arrivals on Wall Street had studied economics, this knowledge was never used; in fact, any academic knowledge was frowned on by traders.\n\nLewis also attributed the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s and 1990s to the inability of inexperienced, provincial, small-town bank managers to compete with Wall Street. He described people on Wall Street as masters at taking advantage of an undiscerning public, which the savings and loan industry provided in abundance.\n\nLewis portrays the 1980s as an era where government deregulation allowed less-than-scrupulous people on Wall Street to take advantage of others' ignorance, and thus grow extremely wealthy.\n\nHe traces the rise of Salomon Brothers through mortgage trading, when deregulation by the U.S. Congress suddenly allowed managers of savings and loan associations to start selling mortgages as bonds. Lewis Ranieri, a Salomon Brothers' employee, had created the only viable mortgage trading section on Wall Street, so when the law passed, it became a windfall for the firm.\n\nHowever, Lewis believed that Salomon Brothers became too complacent in their new-found wealth and took to unwise expansion and massive displays of conspicuous consumption. When the rest of Wall Street wised up to the market, the firm lost its advantage.\n\nAnother problem Lewis noticed was a large disconnect between what Salomon Brothers mortgage traders were paid, and what they \"believed\" they should have been paid. Ranieri and his fellow traders felt that, since their department generated so much money for the firm, they ought to receive considerably higher salaries and compensation. Gutfreund and other managers, on the other hand, argued that the traders were not risking their own money, but the firm's, and noted that the mortgage department spent years losing money before succeeding. Because of this disagreement, Salomon Brothers lost many of its traders when other firms that added mortgage bonds to their business began to offer higher salaries, easily luring the Salomon Brothers mortgage bond traders away.\n\nLikewise, Lewis argued that Salomon Brothers tried to \"professionalize\" itself. As he notes, Ranieri and his fellow traders lacked college degrees; one of the traders had not even finished the eighth grade. Despite their lack of academic credentials, the group was extremely successful financially. But in order to improve its \"image,\" the firm began to hire graduates of prestigious business and economics programs. Because of his uncouth manners, Ranieri (along with many of his Italian American colleagues) were eventually fired.\n\nLewis argued that Salomon Brothers' mortgage-bond success was based not on innate intelligence or trading skill, but on pure luck. Lewis noted that, although Ranieri was often hailed as a \"visionary\" for creating a mortgage department before a mortgage market existed, deregulation caught him completely by surprise. The firms that lured away Salomon's traders with higher salaries ended up losing money, as it soon became clear that the traders lacked any special skills: they just happened to be working in mortgages during a period of rising bond prices. After enough firms became involved with mortgage bonds, prices stabilized, and the bonds eventually traded like any others.\n\nAfter dealing with mortgage bonds, Lewis examined junk bonds and described how Michael Milken built junk bonds from nothing to a multi-trillion-dollar market. Because the demand for junk bonds was higher than its supply, Lewis argues that corporate raiders began to attack otherwise sound companies in order to create more junk bonds.\n\nLewis remarked in his conclusion that the 1980s were a time when anyone could make millions, provided they were in the right place at the right time, as exemplified by Lewis Ranieri's success.\n\n\n\n"}

Market information systems play an important role in agro-industrialisation and food supply chains. With the advance of Information and communication technologies for development (ICTs) in developing countries, the income- generation opportunities offered by market information systems have been sought by international development organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and businesses alike.\n\nThere is a wide variety of market information systems or services. OECD countries have traditionally emphasised the importance of information provision for the agricultural sector, a notable example being the service provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Such systems are widely used in order to increase the transparency and the volume of information flowing through the supply chains for different agricultural products. The ability of market information systems to provide a valuable service was strengthened with the development of the Internet and the advance of electronic commerce (business-to-business (B2B), consumer-to-consumer, etc.). Industry structure, product complexity and the demanding nature of agricultural transactions are considered determining factors for the development of B2B electronic commerce in agriculture.\n\nIn developing countries, market information initiatives are often part of broader interventions and part of the agricultural marketing and agribusiness development strategy that many governments are actively engaged in. It is commonly understood that long transaction chains, lack of transparency, lack of standards, and insufficient access to markets for products has perpetuated low incomes in predominantly agrarian economies. Early attempts at market information provision in developing countries involved government bodies in collecting price information, and arranging for this to be disseminated via newspapers and radio stations. The information provided was often not very accurate and usually reached farmers too late to be of practical use. Governments often attempted to cover far too many locations and many services either collapsed after initial donor assistance came to an end or managed to struggle along with little impact. Furthermore, it was soon recognised that it was not enough just to supply market information to farmers. They needed assistance in understanding how to use that information. However, donor organizations, such as FAO, CTA, IICD, USAID, DFID, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, remain committed to improving the efficiencies within the supply chain through greater information provision. The recent surge of mobile phone usage in developing countries has provided an opportunity for innovative projects to leverage this new distribution channel to get critical market data into the hands of farmers and traders, taking advantage of the SMS capacity of phones. Using the so-called \"push\" method recipients of information are identified on a database and automatically receive messages of relevance to them. Alternatively, the \"pull\" method enables farmers and traders to interrogate the database of the MIS. A farmer can send an SMS with the product and location he is interested in (e.g. tomatoes;Nairobi) and receive an immediate reply. Several projects by Reuters, Nokia, Esoko, KACE, Manobi, AgRisk and others have demonstrated the impact that such information can have. Amongst donors there is a renewed interest in promoting regional trade, particularly in Africa, and market information is seen as an important way of achieving this. Examples of donor-supported services are RATIN for East Africa and RESIMAO for West Africa.\n\nNevertheless, it remains unclear whether MIS can be delivered on a profitable basis by the private sector, given the difficulty of fully covering costs, or on a sustainable basis by the public sector, given the latter's history of gathering inaccurate data and disseminating it badly. To try to address some of these problems, a new approach makes the buyers responsible for uploading the price information via SMS, and facilitates trade by creating a capacity for sellers to contact individual buyers. Others question whether formal systems are still necessary when farmers can just contact traders by phone. Work in Bangladesh, India, China and Vietnam found that 80% of farmers now own cell phones and they use these to speak to multiple traders about prices and demand and to conclude deals. A study in the Philippines found that farmers using cell phones reported improved relationships with their trading partners, possibly because the ability to compare prices made them trust their buyers more. Studies in Niger and India demonstrate the impact of cell phones in reducing price variations and creating greater equilibrium among markets. Introduction of internet kiosks and cafes that provide wholesale price information to farmers has been shown to enhance the functioning of rural markets by increasing the competitiveness of local traders in India.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50% of outstanding shares, or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent.\n\nIt is, however, possible (such as through special voting rights) for a controlling interest requiring consolidation to be achieved without exceeding 50% ownership, depending on the accounting standards being employed. Minority interest belongs to other investors and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet of the owning company to reflect the claim on assets belonging to other, non-controlling shareholders. Also, minority interest is reported on the consolidated income statement as a share of profit belonging to minority shareholders.\n\nThe reporting of 'minority interest' is a consequence of the requirement by accounting standards to 'fully' consolidate partly owned subsidiaries. Full consolidation, as opposed to partial consolidation, results in financial statements that are constructed as if the parent corporation fully owns these partly owned subsidiaries; except for two line items that reflect partial ownership of subsidiaries: net income to common shareholders and common equity. The two minority interest line items are the net difference between what would have been the common equity and net income to common, if all subsidiaries were fully owned, and the actual ownership of the group. All the other line items in the financial statements assume a fictitious 100% ownership.\n\nSome investors have expressed concern that the minority interest line items cause significant uncertainty for the assessment of value, leverage and liquidity. A key concern of investors is that they cannot be sure what part of the reported cash position is owned by a 100% subsidiary and what part is owned by a 51% subsidiary.\n\nMinority interest is an integral part of the enterprise value of a company. The converse concept is an associate company.\n\nUnder the International Financial Reporting Standards, the non-controlling interest is reported in accordance with IFRS 5 and is shown at the very bottom of the Equity section on the consolidated balance sheet and subsequently on the statement of changes in equity. Under US GAAP minority interest can be reported either in the liabilities section, the equity section, or the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The Mezzanine section is located between liabilities and equity. FASB FAS 160 and FAS 141r significantly alter the way a parent company accounts for non-controlling interest (NCI) in a subsidiary. It is no longer acceptable to report minority interest in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet.\n\n"}

Another brother, Richard Walsh, was a Jesuit. (1992, n. 28, p. 191). \n\nIt was in his capacity as Mayor that Walsh first came to notice, acting as a “representative from the ‘’Urbs Intacta’’ to Queen Elizabeth”. Marmaduke Middleton, Protestant Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, wrote of Walsh in a letter to Sir Francis Walsingham dated 29 June 1580, describing the citizens of Waterford as “stiffnecked, stubborn, papistical and incorrigible’’. He attributed their stance to Walsh, saying of him:\n\n‘’the greatest support of this is he, which was the last year mayor, whose name is Sir Patrick Walsh, a counterfeit Christian, and a great enemy of God’s truth.

{"id": "9674107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9674107", "title": "Pharmacokinetics", "text": "Pharmacokinetics\n\nPharmacokinetics (from Ancient Greek \"pharmakon\" \"drug\" and \"kinetikos\" \"moving, putting in motion\"; see chemical kinetics), sometimes abbreviated as PK, is a branch of pharmacology dedicated to determining the fate of substances administered to a living organism. The substances of interest include any chemical xenobiotic such as: pharmaceutical drugs, pesticides, food additives, cosmetics, etc. It attempts to analyze chemical metabolism and to discover the fate of a chemical from the moment that it is administered up to the point at which it is completely eliminated from the body. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how an organism affects a drug, whereas pharmacodynamics (PD) is the study of how the drug affects the organism. Both together influence dosing, benefit, and adverse effects, as seen in PK/PD models.\n\nPharmacokinetics describes how the body affects a specific xenobiotic/chemical after administration through the mechanisms of absorption and distribution, as well as the metabolic changes of the substance in the body (e.g. by metabolic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 or glucuronosyltransferase enzymes), and the effects and routes of excretion of the metabolites of the drug. Pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals are affected by the route of administration and the dose of administered drug. These may affect the absorption rate.\n\nModels have been developed to simplify conceptualization of the many processes that take place in the interaction between an organism and a chemical substance. One of these, the multi-compartmental model, is the most commonly used approximations to reality; however, the complexity involved in adding parameters with that modelling approach means that \"monocompartmental models\" and above all \"two compartmental models\" are the most-frequently used. The various compartments that the model is divided into are commonly referred to as the ADME scheme (also referred to as LADME if liberation is included as a separate step from absorption):\n\nThe two phases of metabolism and excretion can also be grouped together under the title elimination.\nThe study of these distinct phases involves the use and manipulation of basic concepts in order to understand the process dynamics. For this reason in order to fully comprehend the \"kinetics\" of a drug it is necessary to have detailed knowledge of a number of factors such as: the properties of the substances that act as excipients, the characteristics of the appropriate biological membranes and the way that substances can cross them, or the characteristics of the enzyme reactions that inactivate the drug.\n\nAll these concepts can be represented through mathematical formulas that have a corresponding graphical representation. The use of these models allows an understanding of the characteristics of a molecule, as well as how a particular drug will behave given information regarding some of its basic characteristics such as its acid dissociation constant (pKa), bioavailability and solubility, absorption capacity and distribution in the organism.\n\nThe model outputs for a drug can be used in industry (for example, in calculating bioequivalence when designing generic drugs) or in the clinical application of pharmacokinetic concepts. Clinical pharmacokinetics provides many performance guidelines for effective and efficient use of drugs for human-health professionals and in veterinary medicine.\n\nThe following are the most commonly measured pharmacokinetic metrics:\nIn pharmacokinetics, \"steady state\" refers to the situation where the overall intake of a drug is fairly in dynamic equilibrium with its elimination. In practice, it is generally considered that steady state is reached when a time of 4 to 5 times the half-life for a drug after regular dosing is started.\n\nThe following graph depicts a typical time course of drug plasma concentration and illustrates main pharmacokinetic metrics:\n\nPharmacokinetic modelling is performed by noncompartmental or compartmental methods. Noncompartmental methods estimate the exposure to a drug by estimating the area under the curve of a concentration-time graph. Compartmental methods estimate the concentration-time graph using kinetic models. Noncompartmental methods are often more versatile in that they do not assume any specific compartmental model and produce accurate results also acceptable for bioequivalence studies.\nThe final outcome of the transformations that a drug undergoes in an organism and the rules that determine this fate depend on a number of interrelated factors. A number of functional models have been developed in order to simplify the study of pharmacokinetics. These models are based on a consideration of an organism as a number of related compartments. The simplest idea is to think of an organism as only one homogenous compartment. This \"monocompartmental model\" presupposes that blood plasma concentrations of the drug are a true reflection of the drug’s concentration in other fluids or tissues and that the elimination of the drug is directly proportional to the drug’s concentration in the organism (first order kinetics).\n\nHowever, these models do not always truly reflect the real situation within an organism. For example, not all body tissues have the same blood supply, so the distribution of the drug will be slower in these tissues than in others with a better blood supply. In addition, there are some tissues (such as the brain tissue) that present a real barrier to the distribution of drugs, that can be breached with greater or lesser ease depending on the drug’s characteristics. If these relative conditions for the different tissue types are considered along with the rate of elimination, the organism can be considered to be acting like two compartments: one that we can call the \"central compartment\" that has a more rapid distribution, comprising organs and systems with a well-developed blood supply; and a \"peripheral compartment\" made up of organs with a lower blood flow. Other tissues, such as the brain, can occupy a variable position depending on a drug’s ability to cross the barrier that separates the organ from the blood supply.\n\nThis \"two compartment model\" will vary depending on which compartment elimination occurs in. The most common situation is that elimination occurs in the central compartment as the liver and kidneys are organs with a good blood supply. However, in some situations it may be that elimination occurs in the peripheral compartment or even in both. This can mean that there are three possible variations in the two compartment model, which still do not cover all possibilities.\n\nThis model may not be applicable in situations where some of the enzymes responsible for metabolizing the drug become saturated, or where an active elimination mechanism is present that is independent of the drug's plasma concentration. In the real world each tissue will have its own distribution characteristics and none of them will be strictly linear. If we label the drug’s volume of distribution within the organism Vd and its volume of distribution in a tissue Vd the former will be described by an equation that takes into account all the tissues that act in different ways, that is:\n\nThis represents the \"multi-compartment model\" with a number of curves that express complicated equations in order to obtain an overall curve. A number of computer programs have been developed to plot these equations. However complicated and precise this model may be, it still does not truly represent reality despite the effort involved in obtaining various distribution values for a drug. This is because the concept of distribution volume is a relative concept that is not a true reflection of reality. The choice of model therefore comes down to deciding which one offers the lowest margin of error for the drug involved.\n\nNoncompartmental PK analysis is highly dependent on estimation of total drug exposure. Total drug exposure is most often estimated by area under the curve (AUC) methods, with the trapezoidal rule (numerical integration) the most common method. Due to the dependence on the length of \"x\" in the trapezoidal rule, the area estimation is highly dependent on the blood/plasma sampling schedule. That is, the closer time points are, the closer the trapezoids reflect the actual shape of the concentration-time curve.\n\nCompartmental PK analysis uses kinetic models to describe and predict the concentration-time curve. PK compartmental models are often similar to kinetic models used in other scientific disciplines such as chemical kinetics and thermodynamics. The advantage of compartmental over some noncompartmental analyses is the ability to predict the concentration at any time. The disadvantage is the difficulty in developing and validating the proper model. Compartment-free modelling based on curve stripping does not suffer this limitation. The simplest PK compartmental model is the one-compartmental PK model with IV bolus administration and first-order elimination. The most complex PK models (called PBPK models) rely on the use of physiological information to ease development and validation.\n\n\"Linear pharmacokinetics\" is so-called because the graph of the relationship between the various factors involved (dose, blood plasma concentrations, elimination, etc.) gives a straight line or an approximation to one. For drugs to be effective they need to be able to move rapidly from blood plasma to other body fluids and tissues.\n\nThe change in concentration over time can be expressed as formula_2\n\nThe graph for the non-linear relationship between the various factors is represented by a curve; the relationships between the factors can then be found by calculating the dimensions of different areas under the curve. The models used in \"non-linear pharmacokinetics\" are largely based on Michaelis–Menten kinetics.\nA reaction’s factors of non-linearity include the following:\n\nIt can therefore be seen that non-linearity can occur because of reasons that affect the entire pharmacokinetic sequence: absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination.\n\nVariable volume pharmacokinetic models can be drug centered models that imply a volume of drug distribution to be that volume in which the drug is distributed at that elapsed time following drug administration. Another possibility occurs when the body volume is changing in time, which would occur, for example, during dialysis when the volume in which a drug can be distributed is itself changing in time.\n\nAt a practical level, a drug’s bioavailability can be defined as the proportion of the drug that reaches its site of action. From this perspective the intravenous administration of a drug provides the greatest possible bioavailability, and this method is considered to yield a bioavailability of 1 (or 100%). Bioavailability of other delivery methods is compared with that of intravenous injection («absolute bioavailability») or to a standard value related to other delivery methods in a particular study («relative bioavailability»).\n\nOnce a drug’s bioavailability has been established it is possible to calculate the changes that need to be made to its dosage in order to reach the required blood plasma levels. Bioavailability is therefore a mathematical factor for each individual drug that influences the administered dose. It is possible to calculate the amount of a drug in the blood plasma that has a real potential to bring about its effect using the formula: formula_5; where \"De\" is the effective dose, \"B\" bioavailability and \"Da\" the administered dose.\n\nTherefore, if a drug has a bioavailability of 0.8 (or 80%) and it is administered in a dose of 100 mg, the equation will demonstrate the following:\n\nThat is the 100 mg administered represents a blood plasma concentration of 80 mg that has the capacity to have a pharmaceutical effect.\nThis concept depends on a series of factors inherent to each drug, such as:\n\nThese concepts, which are discussed in detail in their respective titled articles, can be mathematically quantified and integrated to obtain an overall mathematical equation:\n\nwhere Q is the drug’s purity.\n\nwhere formula_8 is the drug’s rate of administration and formula_9 is the rate at which the absorbed drug reaches the circulatory system.\n\nFinally, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and knowing the drug’s formula_10 (pH at which there is an equilibrium between its ionized and non ionized molecules), it is possible to calculate the non ionized concentration of the drug and therefore the concentration that will be subject to absorption:\n\nWhen two drugs have the same bioavailability, they are said to be biological equivalents or bioequivalents. This concept of bioequivalence is important because it is currently used as a yardstick in the authorization of generic drugs in many countries.\n\nA number of phases occur once the drug enters into contact with the organism, these are described using the acronym LADME:\n\nSome textbooks combine the first two phases as the drug is often administered in an active form, which means that there is no liberation phase. Others include a phase that combines distribution, metabolism and excretion into a disposition phase. Other authors include the drug’s toxicological aspect in what is known as \"ADME-Tox\" or \"ADMET\".\n\nEach of the phases is subject to physico-chemical interactions between a drug and an organism, which can be expressed mathematically. Pharmacokinetics is therefore based on mathematical equations that allow the prediction of a drug’s behavior and which place great emphasis on the relationships between drug plasma concentrations and the time elapsed since the drug’s administration.\n\nBioanalytical methods are necessary to construct a concentration-time profile. Chemical techniques are employed to measure the concentration of drugs in biological matrix, most often plasma. Proper bioanalytical methods should be selective and sensitive. For example, microscale thermophoresis can be used to quantify how the biological matrix/liquid affects the affinity of a drug to its target.\n\nPharmacokinetics is often studied using mass spectrometry because of the complex nature of the matrix (often plasma or urine) and the need for high sensitivity to observe concentrations after a low dose and a long time period. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however it is common to use curve fitting with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is not linear across large concentration ranges.\n\nThere is currently considerable interest in the use of very high sensitivity mass spectrometry for microdosing studies, which are seen as a promising alternative to animal experimentation.\n\n\"Population pharmacokinetics\" is the study of the sources and correlates of variability in drug concentrations among individuals who are the target patient population receiving clinically relevant doses of a drug of interest. Certain patient demographic, pathophysiological, and therapeutical features, such as body weight, excretory and metabolic functions, and the presence of other therapies, can regularly alter dose-concentration relationships. For example, steady-state concentrations of drugs eliminated mostly by the kidney are usually greater in patients suffering from renal failure than they are in patients with normal renal function receiving the same drug dosage. Population pharmacokinetics seeks to identify the measurable pathophysiologic factors that cause changes in the dose-concentration relationship and the extent of these changes so that, if such changes are associated with clinically significant shifts in the therapeutic index, dosage can be appropriately modified.\nAn advantage of population pharmacokinetic modelling is its ability to analyse sparse data sets (sometimes only one concentration measurement per patient is available).\n\nClinical pharmacokinetics (arising from the clinical use of population pharmacokinetics) is the direct application to a therapeutic situation of knowledge regarding a drug’s pharmacokinetics and the characteristics of a population that a patient belongs to (or can be ascribed to).\n\nAn example is the relaunch of the use of ciclosporin as an immunosuppressor to facilitate organ transplant. The drug's therapeutic properties were initially demonstrated, but it was almost never used after it was found to cause nephrotoxicity in a number of patients. However, it was then realized that it was possible to individualize a patient's dose of ciclosporin by analysing the patients plasmatic concentrations (pharmacokinetic monitoring). This practice has allowed this drug to be used again and has facilitated a great number of organ transplants.\n\nClinical monitoring is usually carried out by determination of plasma concentrations as this data is usually the easiest to obtain and the most reliable. The main reasons for determining a drug’s plasma concentration include:\n\nDrugs where pharmacokinetic monitoring is recommended include:\nEcotoxicology is the branch of science that deals with the nature, effects, and interactions of substances that are harmful to the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll model based software above.\n\nGlobal centres with the highest profiles for providing in-depth training include the Universities of Buffalo,\nFlorida, Gothenburg, Leiden, Otago, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo, Uppsala, Washington, Manchester, Monash University, and University of Sheffield.\n"}

According to the memoirs of his sister Rosalie, he became aware of the potentialities of chocolate manufacturing as an industry at the very early age of about twelve. To fulfill his dream, six years later he started as an apprentice in his brother Frédéric's \"Konditorei\" in Bern. In 1824 he left Switzerland to visit the United States. At the end of the year he returned and opened a confectioner's business in Neuchâtel. In 1826, Suchard opened the factory of Chocolat Suchard in Serrières. He used hydropower of the nearby river to run the mills in his two-man factory. Suchard used a grinding mill consisting of a heated granite plate, and several granite rollers moving forwards and backwards. This design is still used to grind cocoa paste.\n\nChocolate was not cheap or a product for everybody. Suchard struggled financially early in his career as a chocolatier. His success came in 1842, with a bulk order from Frederick William IV, king of Prussia, who was also the prince of Neuchâtel. This triggered a boom and soon his chocolates won prizes at the London Great Exhibition of 1851 and the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855. He opened his first factory abroad in 1880 in Lörrach, Germany, becoming the first to do so. The unusual purple color of the chocolate packaging was selected by Suchard, who believed it would be unique among chocolate packaging. By the end of the 19th century, Suchard had become the largest chocolate producer. Seventeen years after his death in 1884 in Neuchâtel, his company produced the famous Milka chocolate for the Swiss market. After his death, his daughter Eugénie Suchard and her husband Karl Russ-Suchard, took over the functioning of his factory. Nowadays the factory belongs to the Mondelez group and production has been moved to the Toblerone factory in Bern.\n\nSuchard was not only a chocolatier but also had interest in other areas. In 1834 he introduced and captained the first steamer, \"Industriel\", on Lake Neuchâtel. He also tried introducing silkworm culture in Switzerland in 1837, but the silkworms were destroyed during an epidemic in 1843. His interest in managing river water and controlling floods led to the sinking of the water level in Lake Neuchâtel. The lowered lake shoreline revealed the Celtic settlement of La Tène dating back to around 450 BC.\n\n"}

The relationship between the president and the Chief Executive Officer varies, depending on the structure of the specific organization. In a similar vein to the Chief Operating Officer, the title of corporate President as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a \"C-Suite\" designation, such as \"President and Chief Executive Officer\" or \"President and Chief Operating Officer\") is also loosely defined; the President is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various Vice Presidents (including Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO. The powers of the president vary widely across organizations and such powers come from specific authorization in the bylaws (e.g. the president can make an \"executive decision\" only if the bylaws allow for it).\n\nOriginally, the term \"president\" was used to designate someone who presided over a meeting, and was used in the same way that \"foreman\" or \"overseer\" is used now (the term is still used in that sense today). It has now also come to mean \"chief officer\" in terms of administrative or executive duties.\n\nIn addition to the administrative or executive duties in organizations, the president has the duties of presiding over meetings. Such duties at meetings include:\nWhile presiding, the president should remain impartial and not interrupt a speaker if the speaker has the floor and is following the rules of the group. In committees or small boards, the president votes along with the other members. However, in assemblies or larger boards, the president should vote only when it can affect the result. At a meeting, the president only has one vote (i.e. the president cannot vote twice and cannot override the decision of the group unless the organization has specifically given the president such authority).\n\nThe powers of the president vary widely across organizations. In some organizations the president has the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions, while in others the president only makes recommendations to a board of directors, and still others the president has no executive powers and is mainly a spokesman for the organization. The amount of power given to the president depends on the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.\n\nIf the president exceeds the given authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform the duties, the president may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include censure, suspension, or removal from office. The rules of the particular organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures and the extent that they can be done. Usually, whoever appointed or elected the president has the power to discipline this officer.\n\nSome organizations may have a position of President-Elect in addition to the position of President. Generally the membership of the organization elects a President-Elect and when the term of the President-Elect is complete, that person automatically becomes President.\n\nSome organizations may have a position of Immediate Past President in addition to the position of President. In those organizations, when the term of the President is complete, that person automatically fills the position of Immediate Past President. The organization can have such a position only if the bylaws provide it. The duties of such a position would also have to be provided in the bylaws.\n\n"}

Vassallo (24 March 1942 – 21 January 2007) was the president and CEO of Vassallo Industries, headquartered in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The company produces PVC injection moulded and extruded goods, and markets them worldwide.\n\nVassallo (birth name: Salvador V. Vassallo Ruiz ), grandparents migrated from Italy in the late 19th century and settled in the town of Yauco. Vassallo, nicknamed \"Chiry\", and his brothers were born in Yauco and raised in the city of Ponce where their father, Salvador Vassallo Sr., opened a hardware store.\n\nAfter school hours, Vassallo and his brothers, Efraín, Víctor, Félix, and Marcos, would work in the family business. Salvador Vassallo Sr. founded Vassallo Industries, Inc., a company which initially made only windows and cement blocks.\n\nAfter Vassallo graduated from college, he went to work in as a salesman for his father's business. Traveling throughout Puerto Rico taking orders from established customers, he made new contacts with potential customers. These skills would serve him well when Vassallo and his brothers inherited the business. In the 1950s, Vassallo's brother Efrain David, an engineer and the oldest of the Vassallo brothers, saw the potential in plastic.\n\nAs a consequence of Efrain's vision, in 1962 Vassallo Industries Inc. pioneered the manufacture and distribution of plastic pipe and fittings for sanitary and electrical applications. In 1972, Salvador Vassallo Sr. died and the company was inherited by his sons. Efrain David was President and Chief Executive Officer of Vassallo Industries Inc. from 1978-89. During those 11 years the firm had a net profit of over $25 million, as audited by Deloitte, Haskins & Sells, 1978-89.\n\nIn 1989, Efrain David sold his interest in Vassallo Industries and all his patents to his brothers, and joined son Efrain David Jr., in the development of the Puerto Rican marble industry. Vassallo Industries, Inc., named Salvador as its president, and the company grew to become a global leader in the manufacture of PVC. Today, it has strong brand recognition in the United States and Latin-America. In the 1980s Vassallo opened a distribution Center in Miami, Florida, to speed up order fulfillment and cut costs.\n\nIn 1989 Salvador bought out his brothers and became president and chairman, assuming the CEO post in 2002. In the 1990s Vassallo founded Vassallo Molding Company for the manufacture of plastic furniture and household goods. In 1997, Home Depot became a client in addition to Kmart and Wal-Mart. The company added a research and development division to its growing empire, with emphasis on quality control. The company now has over forty patents for different PVC products.\n\nIn January 2000, Efrain Vassallo (the only Puerto Rican named National Small Businessman of the Year [in 1996], to date) rejoined his brother in Vassallo Industries Inc as a consultant. In 2003, Vassallo Industries Inc. invested $15 million in the expansion of its facility in Ponce, in an effort to produce Polyvinyl Chloride pellets for distribution in the United States, Caribbean and Latin America.\n\nIn 2004, Vassallo Industries Inc. acquired Syroco Inc., a plastics manufacturer, adding manufacturing operations in California, New York, and Arkansas. Syroco is one of the most prominent manufacturers of plastic furniture and wall decor in the United States. By acquiring Syroco, Vassallo Industries Inc. added Target, Sam's Club, Lowe's and Walgreens to its clientele.\n\nAmong the many products manufactured by the company founded by Salvador Vassallo are the following: fittings, flexible conduit, flower pots, leaf rakes, step stones, water tanks, pipes, PVC cement, kayaks and water floats. The company produces plastic furniture under the brand Signature Series Line.\n\nVassallo's son, Rafael Vassallo, was named the president of Vassallo Industries Inc. and executive vice president of Syroco Inc. Salvador Vassallo continued to be the CEO of the company and president of the Export Council of Puerto Rico. His nephew, Jesse, (Victor's son), a swimmer, has continued the family tradition by establishing \"Vassallo Unlimited\".\n\nOn 21 January 2007, Salvador Vassallo died in the Hospital San Cristóbal in Ponce from a heart attack. He was buried in Las Mercedes Cemetery, and was survived by his wife Olga and two children, Rafael and Viviana. \n\nThe Mayor of Ponce, Francisco Zayas Seijo, declared three days of mourning and ordered the flags at Ponce's City Hall to be flown at half mast.\n\n\n"}

He joined TelecomAsia Corporation, Thailand’s largest telecommunication company, in 1992 and worked his way up from a Senior Officer to senior management where his positions included chief operations and planning officer, executive vice-president for business, and senior vice-president for planning, project coordination and support.\n\nHe also served as chief operations officer of UTV Cable Television and founded a number of subsidiaries for the TelecomAsia Group, such as Asia Wireless Communication Company Limited, a PCT (Person Communication Telephone) operator; Asia Infonet Company Limited, which operates internet businesses; Asia Multimedia Company Limited, a broadband operator; and Wire and Wireless Company Limited, a construction and distribution business.\n\nThe years 1992 to 1996 were a boom era for the Thai telecommunications industry. The government had granted concessions to allow the private sector to invest in fixed-line, mobile and other new telecom services. Many private companies received both domestic and overseas loans to invest in the Thai telecom business. CP Group was one of the few privately owned Thai companies with the potential to operate such a business and it was invited to compete with foreign companies in a bid for concessions, which CP Group won.\n\nSuphachai first worked in the company’s operations room and gradually gained knowledge about the fixed-line business where he worked as the senior officer for the president’s office. He was promoted until he was responsible for managing network rollout, being responsible for the overview of the business and for leading the installation of a network of 2.6 million fixed-line phones. The network was successfully installed within two years.\n\nAs with most Thai companies, TelecomAsia was affected by the 1997 Asian financial crisis which saw the Thai Baht collapse from 25 Baht/USD to 55 Baht/USD. The company’s debt almost doubled to around 90 billion Baht and it was unable to repay its obligations within the due date and had to negotiate delayed repayment and enter a restructuring process.\n\nSuphachai explained to creditors that the fixed-line business was still growing and that evolving technology would lead to the development of data services which TelecomAsia would be able to commercially exploit. The creditors approved TelecomAsia’s restructured debt-repayment program.\n\nOnce the economy had recovered from the Asian financial crisis, the company developed a diverse range of new marketing activities which helped improve its financial position and revenue base. In 1999 Suphachai was promoted to the position of President and CEO.\n\nIn 2003, Suphachai and then TelecomAsia invested heavily in building up the country's third national wireless carrier, over a decade behind competitors. TA Orange grew rapidly during its first years under heavy and innovative marketing campaign.\n\nSuphachai and TA Orange soon ran into trouble when France Telecom acquired Orange (UK) and France Telecom refused to increase capital and funding into the TA Orange joint venture. TA Orange, thus, was unable to keep up with competitor investments and expand its network fast enough.\n\nIn 2005, TelecomAsia finally struck a deal to buyout France Telecom's stake in TA Orange for 1 Thai Baht. Upon the buyback of TA Orange, TelecomAsia transformed itself into \"True Corporation\". It rebranded under a fresh and modern logo. It consolidated into True Mobile, which evolved from TA Orange, and True Online, which evolved from TelecomAsia's internet broadband business. Suphachai soon also took a controlling stake in UBC, then the country's leading independent pay TV provider, and transformed it into True Visions.\n\nUnder Suphachai's leadership, TelecomAsia transformed from a fix line phone provider to Thailand's leading telecommunications conglomerate, being Thailand's largest internet service provider, cable/pay TV provider, and the country's third largest wireless carrier with some 24 million subscribers. Under his leadership, True Corporation grew 1,000% from sales of less than $300 million to over $3 billion within less than 10 years.\n\nIn June 2015 Suphachai was presented with the “2015 Frost & Sullivan Asia Pacific Telecom CEO of the Year” award at The Asia Pacific ICT Awards in Singapore for his leadership and outstanding achievements in developing the telecommunications industry within the Asia Pacific region. He was selected as the award recipient by a panel of judges comprising top executives from leading telecommunications companies across the region as well as analysts from Frost & Sullivan. In the same month, Suphachai was elected President of The Telecommunications Association of Thailand under The Royal Patronage.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the leadership of Suphachai Chearavanont since 1999, True Corporation Plc has won many awards and recognitions from various local and international organizations:\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2010\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\nAwards summary 2000-2007\n\n\n\nTranslated from\nเข้าถึงได้จาก: http://www.prachachat.net/news_detail.php?newsid=1321066936&grpid=no&catid=06 (วันที่ค้นข้อมูล: 3 พฤษภาคม 2555).\nเข้าถึงได้จาก: http://www.gotomanager.com/news/details.aspx?id=94068 (วันที่ค้นข้อมูล: 3 พฤษภาคม 2555).\nเข้าถึงได้จาก: http://www.gotomanager.com/news/details.aspx?id=94067 (วันที่ค้นข้อมูล: 3 พฤษภาคม 2555).\nเข้าถึงได้จาก: http://www.gotomanager.com/news/details.aspx?id=94070 (วันที่ค้นข้อมูล: 3 พฤษภาคม 2555).\nเข้าถึงได้จาก: http://www.trueplookpanya.com/true/guidance_detail.php?cms_id=9748 (วันที่ค้นข้อมูล: 3 พฤษภาคม 2555).\n\nเข้าถึงได้จาก: http://www.wearecp.com/tabid/233/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/23044/language/en-US/360Role-Model2554.aspx (วันที่ค้นข้อมูล: 3 พฤษภาคม 2555).\nเข้าถึงได้จาก: http://www.wearecp.com/tabid/280/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1195/-.aspx (วันที่ค้นข้อมูล: 3 พฤษภาคม 2555).\n"}

As a result, all of Y&R's clients — anywhere in the world — get access to precisely the right creative talent they need to create the most appropriate and powerful work.\n\nCreating a collaborative creative culture has resulted in great work and results for clients such as Land Rover, Dell, Wendy’s, Gatorade, and Vodafone.\n\nIt’s also earned great industry recognition. At this past Cannes Lions in June 2015, Y&R won 89 Lions across 15 categories, holding its rank as the fourth most winning agency network of the year for the fourth consecutive year. Y&R had more offices winning Lions than any other network. In addition, Y&R Team Red Istanbul won the Grand Prix in Media for its Red Light App to protect women from domestic abuse.\n\nBefore joining Y&R, Granger spent five years at Saatchi & Saatchi, where he took Saatchi New York to the number one agency at Cannes. There, too, he led the agency’s creative transformation. He led a similar renaissance at Bozell New York, where he took the agency to number three in the world. Granger began his career in his native South Africa, where he led TBWA/Hunt Lascaris, a shop of proud heritage and creative pedigree.\n\nGranger and his agencies have won many awards, and he’s been fortunate to serve as president of several international juries, most recently serving as the Outdoor Jury President at Cannes in 2013. But he’s most proud to have shaped top creative agencies, and worked with the world’s most sought-after clients on some of the most recognized and influential global brands. He is excited about the future of the business and this industry.\n\nIn a series of emails quoted in Business Insider in 2013, Mark Mackay, Executive Chairman of Australian agency The Campaign Palace, described Granger as “an arrogant leader in New York”, as well as lacking “commercial savvy” and as a “bully”. He said, \"One needs to humour bullies and the way that one does it is as I have outlined in these emails.\"\n\nPaul Fishlock, then Executive Creative Director of Campaign Palace, later dismissed, brought a case against the agency and won. In a long article, Australian trade publication Mumbrella reports of the case that \"Fishlock is entirely vindicated in his claims that he was unfairly axed as national creative chief of the now defunct Campaign Palace,\" and that \"The reputation of Young & Rubicam’s global creative director Tony Granger certainly takes a battering in my view. The word “bully” is a hard one to come back from.\"\n\n"}

Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century\n\nThe Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century is a United States federal law, signed on April 5, 2000, seeking to improve airline safety. It is popularly called \"AIR 21,\" and is also known as Public Law 106-181.\n\nOn 11 September 1991, Continental Express Flight 2574, an Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia carrying 14 people, crashed as it was approaching Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, killing all 14 people on board.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation revealed that screws had been removed from the horizontal stabilizer during maintenance the night before the accident and, following a shift change, the screws were not replaced.\n\nNTSB cited the failure of airline maintenance and inspection personnel to adhere to proper maintenance and quality assurance procedures. The failure of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) surveillance to detect and verify compliance with approved procedures was cited as a contributing factor.\n\nSome months after, the same airline had a similar incident when a plane was forced to return to the airport after bolts had been removed from a wing panel. NTSB decried that even a fatal accident and an FAA NASIP inspection weren't enough to overcome what appears to have been corporate culture.\n\nAccording to Meshkati (1997), the crash of Continental Express Flight 2574 was the most dramatic turning point for \"safety culture\" in the United States. As a member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) at that time, Dr. John Lauber suggested that the probable cause of this accident included \"The failure of Continental Express management to establish a corporate culture which encouraged and enforced adherence to approved maintenance and quality assurance procedures\" (NTSB/AAR-92/04, 1992, pg. 54, as cited in Meshkati, 1997). As a result of this and other similar aviation accidents, safety culture came to the forefront as the exclusive topic at the U.S. National Summit on Transportation Safety, hosted by the NTSB in 1997.\n\nAIR 21 was known as H.R. 1000 in 106th Congress, second session. Rep. Bud Shuster (R-Pa.) introduced it on 4 March 1999. It was enacted on 5 April 2000. Upon signing the bill into law, President Bill Clinton stated:\n\nThis bill contains many new provisions to advance aviation safety. Of particular note is the inclusion of the \"Aircraft Safety Act of 1999,\" which my Administration proposed to help stop the indefensible practice of manufacturing, distributing, and installing fraudulently represented, nonconforming aircraft parts. Several significant provisions to provide \"whistleblower\" protections to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and air industry employees, to close a potential loophole in the prosecution of hazardous materials cases, and to combat \"air rage\" incidents in flight, will also address real safety concerns we face today.\n\nAIR 21 set requirements for safety equipment for specific aircraft, added consumer and employee protection provisions, and imposed new requirements for commercial air tour operations over national parks.\n\nTitle V established civil penalties for individuals who interfere with or jeopardize the safety of a cabin crew or other passengers. This provision seeks to deter \"air rage.\"\n\nSection 507 modified the sanction for transporting hazardous materials by removing the requirement that the person have knowledge of the regulation related to the transportation of hazardous materials. However, it permits consideration of lack of knowledge in mitigation of the penalty. This requirement is at 49 U.S.C. 46312.\n\nSection 401 of the bill prohibited a state or local government from preventing people associated with disaster counseling services who are not licensed in that state from providing those services for up to 60 days after an aviation accident. Section 402 of the bill would expand a current preemption of state liability laws by limiting the liability of air carriers that provide information concerning flight reservations to the families of passengers involved in airline accidents. Air carriers are already provided immunity from state liability laws for providing passenger lists under these circumstances. Because neither mandate would require state or local governments to expend funds or to change their laws, CBO estimates that any costs associated with these mandates would be insignificant.\n\nIn Section 725, the act required the Federal Aviation Administration to contract with the National Academy of Sciences for an independent study of the air quality in passenger cabins.\n\nTitle II sought to improve consumer access in all regions of the United States, including those in small communities and rural and remote areas, to affordable, regularly scheduled air service.\n\nSection 221 made it an unfair or deceptive practice for any air carrier, or ticket agent utilizing electronically transmitted tickets for air transportation to fail to notify the purchaser of such a ticket of its expiration date. It did so by amending 49 U.S.C. 41712(b).\n\nSection 224 required airlines to file individual customer service plans with the Secretary of Transportation.\n\nTitle IV made the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) inapplicable to aviation incidents, thereby broadening the circumstances under which relatives can seek compensation for the death of a family member in an aviation incident over the ocean.\n\nAIR 21 also includes a legislative advance for air travelers with disabilities.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that AIR 21 would result in additional outlays totaling about $56 billion over the 2000-2004 period.\n\nTitle I authorized the appropriation of $47.6 billion for FAA operations, facilities, and equipment for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. Title I also provided $19.2 billion in contract authority for the FAA's airport improvement program for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. It provided an additional $7.1 billion in contract authority for the airport improvement program (AIP) over the 2000-2004 period (above the $2.4 billion a year assumed in the baseline). It allowed airports to charge higher passenger facility fees.\n\nAIR 21 took the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) off-budget and exempted AATF spending from the discretionary spending caps, pay-as-you-go procedures, and Congressional budget controls.\nThis provision was a goal of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association which sought to unlock the aviation trust fund.\n\nTitle VII extended the war risk insurance program and prohibited the FAA from charging fees for certain services. This title provided that, of the amounts appropriated for FAA operations in fiscal year 2000, $2 million may be used to eliminate a backlog of equal employment opportunity complaints at the Department of Transportation (DOT).\n\nTitle VI provided whistleblower protection for employees of air carriers who notify authorities that their employer is violating a federal law relating to air carrier safety. The bill set up a complaint and investigation process within the Department of Labor (DOL). The time limit for employees to make such complaints in writing to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is 90 days from the date of each adverse employment action.\n\nSection 715, \"Public Availability of Airmen Records\", allows the Federal Aviation Administration to release the names, addresses, and ratings held by nearly all pilots with a medical certificate. This includes the release of information to private businesses, including those not necessarily having any relation to aviation safety (the intent of the bill). The FAA must notify airmen of this clause via mail and notify them that they have 90 days to opt out of the inclusion of their personal information into the public record. If no action is taken within 90 days, then an opt-in is assumed.\n\n\nMeshkati, N. (1997, April). Human performance, organizational factors and safety culture.
