It unites the Chambers of Commerce and Industry and other similar institutions of the countries of the Mediterranean basin, and works on the assumption that the Black Sea is a natural extension of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nASCAME was formed on 1 October 1982. The Constitutive General Assembly was held in Barcelona, hosted by the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation. It is an Organization with a potential membership of 500 Chambers of Commerce, and other associated entities, from the 23 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nToday, ASCAME is the most important representative of the Mediterranean private sector with over 250 Chambers of Commerce from the 23 countries of the Mediterranean basin. ASCAME is a well-consolidated entity that represents the interest of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and the Private Sector, also being accredited as an economic partner of the EU and international organizations in carrying out economic cooperation projects.\nASCAME represents all North and South chambers and business regardless of their size and sector of activity.\n\nThe Association of the Mediterranean Chambers of Commerce and Industry – ASCAME – was founded on October 1, 1982, as an initiative of the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with its counterparts from different Mediterranean countries, and in 1994 it was transformed in an International Association, on the initiative of the Chamber of Commerce of Marseille. \nFrom the about ten founding member of 1982, today ASCAME brings together over two hundred Chambers of Commerce and similar institutions, from twenty-two Mediterranean countries: Albania, Algeria, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Egypt, France, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Morocco, Serbia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey.\n\nASCAME was created with the primary goal of furthering economic cooperation throughout the Mediterranean region, showing a strategic vision of North-South cooperation and integration. This vision was confirmed by the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership in 1995 and is validated today by the Union for the Mediterranean.\n\nAccording to article 3 of the Statutes, “\"The fundamental purpose of this Association is to establish permanent contacts andforge lasting relationships among its members in order to co-ordinate, implement andpromote studies and joint actions with a view to developing economic exchanges andco-operation within the Mediterranean area of international scope.\"”\n\nThe objectives that the association wants to achieve are:\n\n• The creation of a network of Chambers of Commerce and organisations working in the field of cooperation and economic exchange between countries in the Mediterranean region.\n\n• Promotion of and search for synergies between these countries' economies.\n\n• The creation of working ties between peer institutions aimed at encouraging international cooperation through joint performance of activities and/or studies.\n\n• Assertion of the Mediterranean identity.\n\n• Contribution to create an area of peace, tolerance, security and prosperity.\n\nAs a result of amendments approved by the Extraordinary General Assembly of Tunis of May 2001, the Association envisages two types of membership: \"Full Members\", all the Chambers of Commerce of the Mediterranean countries, and \"Associate Members\", which are the various Mediterranean institutions and organizations having a relationship with the objectives of ASCAME.\n\nCurrently, ASCAME members include:\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Albania\n\n18 Chambers of Commerce from Algeria\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Bosnia & Herzegovina\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Bulgaria\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Cyprus\n\n4 Chambers of Commerce from Croatia\n\n11 Chambers of Commerce from Egypt\n\n18 Chambers of Commerce from France\n\n11 Chambers of Commerce from Greece\n\n38 Chambers of Commerce from Italy\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Jordanian\n\n6 Chambers of Commerce from Lebanon\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Libya\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Macedonia\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Malta\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Montenegro\n\n32 Chambers of Commerce from Morocco\n\n1 Chamber of Commerce from Serbia\n\n24 Chambers of Commerce from Spain\n\n7 Chambers of Commerce from Syria\n\n14 Chambers of Commerce from Tunisia\n\n16 Chambers of Commerce from Turkey\n\nASCAME's operating structure consists of:\n\n- the \"General Assembly\": composed of all members, it defines the general policy and major lines of activity of the Association\n\n- the \"Executive Committee\": the permanent management and administration body of ASCAME\n\n- the \"Bureau\", which acts on behalf of the Executive Committee as regards ordinary and ongoing matters\n\n- the \"General Secretariat\", which is responsible for monitoring the decisions taken by the General Meeting, the Executive Committee and the Bureau, conserving ASCAME records and providing secretarial services\n\n- the \"Commissions\"\n\n- the \"Working Groups\".\n\nThe ASCAME Commissions are created by the Executive Committee in order to achieve the ASCAME objectives.

{"id": "54284106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54284106", "title": "Autonomous diver", "text": "Autonomous diver\n\nAutonomous diver describes the minimum requirements for basic training and certification for recreational scuba divers in international standard ISO 24801-2 and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153-2. Various organizations offer training that meets the requirements of the Autonomous Diver standard. A certification which corresponds to Autonomous Diver allows for independent diving with a dive buddy in open water. Most training organizations do not recommend exceeding a depth of 18 or 20 meters at this level of certification. After completion this certification the training can be extended to a dive leader to ISO 24801-3 or an intermediate not defined by international standards.\nBefore initial diver training and thereafter at regular intervals, a diver should undergo a fitness to dive examination by a diving doctor. In some countries, such an examination is required by law and it is a prerequisite for any training in many diving schools. A diving certification which corresponds to Autonomous Diver and a medical certificate may be required for renting diving equipment and taking part in organised dives. In some countries (e.g. Australia) the law requires every diver to prove basic certification before unsupervised diving activity.\n\nSome diver training organizations offer an intermediate Supervised diver certification which corresponds to ISO 24801-1, which usually only splits the contents of the Autonomous Diver training over two courses and does not qualify the holder to take part in independent dives.\n\nInternational standard ISO 24801-2 includes:\n\nEvery year around 1.7 million people are trained according to ISO 24801. Despite the standardization, the dive courses of individual diving organizations differ considerably in their content, expansion and philosophy. However, the minimum requirements defined in the ISO standard guarantee that a diver can easily convert between training organizations.\n\nThe following certifications meet the requirements for Autonomous Diver:\n\nThe CMAS * (one-star) training goes beyond the requirements defined by the Autonomous Diver standard. CMAS requires the theory test before diving in open water. 6 theory lessons, which build the basic understanding of the learner diver and, after the successful completion of a theory test, at least 6 swimming pool or confined water training sessions, and 5 open water training and assessment dives. The course includes breathhold exercises. After successfully completing the course, training can continue with specialisation courses or the CMAS ** (two star). CMAS recommends maximum depth of 20 meters for one-star divers. For divers aged between 8 and 14 years, a maximum depth of 5 meters is recommended.\n\nThe CMAS * course can be started without prior knowledge of diving. Persons who wish to attend a CMAS * course must be at least 14 years old, and in normal physical health and fitness.\n\nThe basic training standards of the individual CMAS member organizations may differ from the training specified by CMAS.\n\nThe NAUI Scuba Diver course (SD) is a basic diving certification training which corresponds to the standardized Autonomous Diver. The training includes 2 breath-hold and 4 scuba dives. NAUI recommends SD divers to dive to a maximum depth not exceeding 18 meters. After successful completion, the training can be continued with specialty certification or the Advanced Scuba Diver course. The NAUI SD course can be started without previous knowledge of diving. Normal physical health and fitness are required. Persons who wish to attend an SD course must be at least 15 years old. NAUI Junior Scuba Diver training can be attended at the age of 12 years. These children's diving courses differ only in a child-oriented mediation of the same contents.\n\nThe PADI Open Water Diver Course (OWD) is an entry level diver training programme to the ISO standards for Autonomous Diver. PADI allows OWD divers to dive to a depth of 18 meters. After successful completion, training can be continued with specialties or the Advanced Open Water Diver course.\n\nThe course consists of five theory lessons, five swimming pool dives and at least four dives in open water on scuba. They also recommend an optional snorkeling dive and / or \"adventure dive\". PADI follows the \"dive today\" concept. Therefore, after a theory lesson, the dives are usually held on the same day. The pool dives - which can also be done at calm, current-free, shallow places in open water, provide for learning the basic and emergency techniques. These include entering the water, breathing under water from the scuba regulator, using the fins, basic buoyancy control, clearing the mask, recovery of the demand valve and emergency ascent. In the open water dives, the same exercises are repeated in deeper water. There are also techniques for managing cramping, open water descent and ascent, buddy breathing and diver navigation.\n\nOWD is an entry-level course. Normal physical health and fitness are required. Persons who wish to attend a PADI OWD course must be at least 15 years old, but a PADI Junior OWD course (JOWD) can be attended at the age of 10 years. These children's dive courses differ only in a child-oriented mediation of the same contents.\n\nThe Scuba Schools International (SSI) Open Water Diver Course (OWD) is a basic dive certification equivalent to the standard Autonomous Diver. The training includes at least 4 open water dives, which can only be carried out after the successful completion of the theoretical training. SSI allows OWD divers to dive to a maximum depth of 18 meters. After successful completion, training can be continued with specialties or the Advanced Adventurer Course. The SSI OWD is an entry level course. Normal physical health and fitness are required and an SSI Medical Statement must be provided. The learner must be able to swim 180 meters without an aid. Persons who wish to attend an OWD course must be at least 15 years old. An SSI Junior OWD training can be completed at the age of 10 years.

{"id": "189252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189252", "title": "Blue Riband", "text": "Blue Riband\n\nThe Blue Riband () is an unofficial accolade given to the passenger liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean in regular service with the record highest speed. The term was borrowed from horse racing and was not widely used until after 1910. Traditionally, the record is based on average speed rather than passage time because ships follow different routes. \nAlso, eastbound and westbound speed records are reckoned separately, as the more difficult westbound record voyage, against the Gulf Stream and the prevailing weather systems, typically results in lower average speeds.\n\nOf the 35 Atlantic liners to hold the Blue Riband, 25 were British, followed by five German, three American, as well as one each from Italy and France. Thirteen were Cunarders (plus \"Queen Mary\" of Cunard White Star), 5 by White Star, with 4 owned by Norddeutscher Lloyd, 2 by Collins, 2 by Inman and 2 by Guion, and one each by British American, Great Western, Hamburg-America, the Italian Line, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique and finally the United States Lines.\nThe record set by \"United States\" in 1952 remains unbroken by any passenger liner. The next longest period through which the Blue Riband was retained was 19 years, held from 1909 to 1929 by \"Mauretania\". The shortest period was 6 weeks, by \"Bremen\" from July to August 1933. \n\nMany of these ships were built with substantial government subsidies and were designed with military considerations in mind. Winston Churchill estimated that the two Cunard Queens helped shorten the Second World War by a year. The last Atlantic liner to hold the Blue Riband, the SS \"United States\", was designed for her potential use as a troopship as well as her service as a commercial passenger liner.\n\nThere was no formal award until 1935, when Harold K. Hales donated the Hales Trophy; though the rules for the Hales Trophy were different from the traditional rules for the Blue Riband (for example, the Hales Trophy was originally only awarded for westbound records) and changed several times thereafter. It was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders during the express liner era. The trophy continues to be awarded, though many people believe the \"United States\" remains as the holder of the Blue Riband because no subsequent record breaker was in Atlantic passenger service.\n\nThe Ocean Rowing Society inspired by The Blue Riband concept created Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an unsupported row boat. Presently it is the most sought after trophy of ocean rowing.\n\nThe first well-documented crossing of the North Atlantic, though not the earliest, was that of John Cabot's ship \"Matthew\" in the summer of 1497. \"Matthew\" crossed from Bristol to Newfoundland in 35 days, returning the following month in just 17 days.\nOver the next three centuries countless vessels (merchant ships and warships, fast and slow, in peace and war) crossed back and forth over the North Atlantic, all subject to the vagaries of wind and weather. They arrived at port when they could, dependent on the wind, and left when they were loaded, frequently visiting other ports to complete their cargo. During this period eastbound passages of 30 and 45 days were not uncommon, while westward passages of 65 to 90 days excited no attention. It was the advent of the steam ship, with its independence from wind power, which offered the possibility of regular, scheduled Atlantic crossings, in periods of two to three weeks, that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition.\n\nThe term “Blue Riband of the Atlantic” did not come into use until the 1890s, and the history of the trans-Atlantic competition, which was compiled retrospectively, was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships \"Sirius\" and \"Great Western\" in 1838. Although not the first steamships to cross the Atlantic (\"Savannah\" had crossed in 1819, and \"Royal William\" in 1831) nor the fastest to make the crossing (the packet sailing ship \"Columbia\" crossed west to east in 15 days 23 hours in 1830, and crossings by sail packets of 16 and 17 days were not unheard of) the \"Sirius\" and \"Great Western\" were the first steamships offering a regular, scheduled trans-Atlantic service; and crucially, they were involved in a race. Cunard refused officially to recognise the title because racing vessels was not in line with the company's safety policy.\n\nThe idea of building a line of transatlantic steamships was mooted in 1832 by Junius Smith, American lawyer turned London merchant. The idea came to him during an Atlantic crossing which took 57 days, a not unusual occurrence, and it was published in the \"American Rail Road Journal\". After receiving no support for several years, his plan gained credibility when Scottish shipbuilder, Macgregor Laird became an investor. Smith, who is often considered the \"Father of the Atlantic Liner\", formed the British and American Steam Navigation Company to operate a London-New York service. About the same time, the question of Atlantic steamships was discussed at an 1835 director's meeting of the newly formed Great Western Railway when the line’s chief engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel supposedly joked that the line could be made longer by building a steamship to run between Bristol and New York. The necessary investors were recruited by Brunel's friend, Thomas Guppy, a Bristol engineer and businessman. The next year, the Great Western Steamship Company was established, even though the rail line was still years from completion.\n\nBy spring 1838, Brunel’s was ready for sea, but Smith’s first ship was still without engines. When Great Western scheduled its initial sailing, Laird suggested that British and American charter the Irish Sea steamer from the St. George Steam Packet Company for two voyages to beat Great Western. While the \"Sirius\" left Cork, Ireland four days before \"Great Western\" departed Avonmouth, \"Great Western\" still came within a day of overtaking \"Sirius\" to New York. To complete the voyage, \"Sirius\" was forced to burn spars when coal ran low. With her westbound crossing at 8.03 knots (14.87 km/h), \"Sirius\" is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations. \"Great Western\" herself became the prototype for all successful wooden paddlers and made a record-breaking voyage at as late as 1843.\nThe Cunard Line started its Liverpool-Halifax-Boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of \"Great Western\" with about the same speed. Ultimately Cunard built nine additional wood paddlers. By 1846, Cunard was the only original steamship line that survived, largely because of its subsidy from the British Admiralty to carry the mails and its emphasis on safety. Until 1850, the record passed between various Cunarders, finally reaching for an 8-day Liverpool-Halifax crossing by \"Asia\". Record voyages during this period were often the result of using sails to gain extra speed from a following gale.\n\nCunard's first serious competition for the record came from the American-owned Collins Line. The American Government supplied Collins with a substantial subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to Cunard's best. In its first year, 1850, the set the record at on a 10-day run from Liverpool to New York. Unfortunately, Collins suffered a setback when its foundered with heavy loss of life. The next year, Cunard put further pressure on Collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler, the \"Persia\", which set a new record with a 9-day, 16-hour Liverpool-New York voyage at . During the Crimean War, Cunard supplied eleven of its ships for war service and suspended all routes except the Liverpool-Halifax-Boston service. While the Collins' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war, Collins collapsed in 1858 after the loss of two additional steamers. Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of first class passengers and in 1862 commissioned the \"Scotia\", the last paddle steamer to set a record with a Queenstown-New York voyage at . \"Scotia\" was the final significant paddler ordered for the Atlantic because under the terms of Cunard's mail contract with the Admiralty, it was still required to supply paddle steamers when needed for military service.\n\nIn 1845, Brunel’s became the first iron-hulled screw liner on the Atlantic. Starting in 1850, the Inman Line built numerous reduced versions for the steerage trade. In 1866, Inman started to commission single screw express liners that were the equal of \"Scotia\". The Admiralty allowed Cunard to order its first screw express liner, the \"Russia\". In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the White Star Line commissioned \"Oceanic\" and her five sisters. The following year, White Star’s \"Adriatic\" finally surpassed \"Scotia\" with a voyage at . The new White Star record breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines, but their high ratio of length to beam (10:1 compared to the previous norm of 8:1) increased vibration. To counter this, White Star placed the dining saloon midships and made their ships more luxurious. Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard, but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals. In 1875, Inman’s new \"City of Berlin\" averaged on its record-breaking voyage.\n\nDuring the five-year shipping depression that began in 1873, William Pearce, the controlling partner of the John Elder shipyard, became convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable because she would attract more passengers and spend less time in port. He proposed a ship that crammed the most powerful machinery possible into the hull, sacrificing everything to speed. When Cunard rejected his proposal, Pearce offered his idea to the Guion Line, a firm primarily engaged in the steerage trade. The first ship Pearce built for Guion, the \"Arizona\" was described as a \"souped up transatlantic hot rod\" by one nautical historian. While she only won the eastbound record, two years later, Guion took delivery of the even faster \"Alaska\" that set the record at . To continue the program, Pearce offered Guion favourable terms on a third unit, the \"Oregon\", which raised the record to in 1884. These ships were uncomfortable and their excessive coal consumption made them uneconomic. However, for a while they were popular with American clients because of their American ownership.\n\nAfter being out of the contest for a decade, Cunard finally started to rebuild. In 1884, Cunard purchased \"Oregon\" from the Guion line when that firm defaulted on payments to the shipyard. Later that year, Cunard commissioned the first steel-hulled record-breakers, \"Umbria\" and \"Etruria\". \"Etruria\", the faster of the pair, raised the record to on a 6-day, 2-hour run from Queenstown to Sandy Hook in 1888. However, \"Etruria\" and her sister represented the limit of single screw technology.\n\nThe Inman line fell on hard times after their intended record-breaker, \"City of Rome\" failed to meet expectations and was returned to her builders in 1882. Inman directors agreed to voluntary liquidation so that the largest creditor, the Philadelphia-based International Navigation Company could purchase Inman's assets. The new owners provided the capital to build two outstanding record breakers, the twin screw and the . Starting in 1889, the later ship set the record on four occasions, including a voyage at in 1892. White Star, which had not built an express liner since the of 1875, commissioned the record-breaker, of 1889 and of 1890 after receiving a subsidy from the Admiralty to make the pair available as merchant cruisers in the event of hostilities. Cunard countered with two even faster ships, the \"Campania\" and the \"Lucania\" of 1893. The next year, \"Lucania\" recorded a voyage at . Inman became the American Line and ordered two additional express liners from American yards, but no attempt was made to best the new Cunarders. In 1894, Guion ceased sailing as its ships were now hopelessly outdated.\n\nNo sooner had Cunard reestablished its supremacy than new rivals emerged. Beginning in the late 1860s, several German firms commissioned liners that were almost as fast as the British mail steamers working from Liverpool. In 1889, the Hamburg-America Line commissioned four double screw steamers capable of . Its rival, Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) lagged behind until 1895 when it ordered two ships intended to take the record. In 1898, the raised the record to , while the other liner, \"Kaiser Friedrich\" failed to achieve her contract speed and was returned to her builders. Hamburg America ordered the even more powerful that reached on one of her record-breaking 1900 voyages. However, Hamburg America quickly learned that these high powered double screw liners had vibration problems. \"Deutschland\" had the unpleasant nickname, \"cocktail shaker\" and actually lost part of her stern in 1902 because of the constant vibration.\n\nRather than match the new German speedsters, White Star decided to drop out of the competition and commission the four large \"Celtic\"-class luxury liners of more moderate speed. White Star realised that passengers preferred comfort even if this means spending an extra day at sea. In 1902, White Star joined the well capitalised American combine, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM) that owned the American Line and others. IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. After its bad experience with the \"Deutschland\", Hamburg America also dropped out of the race and commissioned large luxury liners based on the \"Celtic\". However, NDL completed building a fleet of four additional express liners modelled on \"Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse\".\n\nAfter 1902, only the Cunard Line and the French Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (CGT) were independent of the IMM combine. British prestige was at stake, and the Government provided Cunard with an annual subsidy of £150,000 plus a low interest loan of £2.5 million to pay for the construction of the two superliners, \"Lusitania\" and \"Mauretania\" under the condition that they be available for conversion to armed cruisers when needed by the navy. Starting in 1907, both ships won the Blue Riband and \"Mauretania’s\" 1909 record of stood for 20 years. However, these ships paid a price for speed and lacked many of the amenities found in the new White Star and Hamburg American luxury liners. Both Cunard rivals ordered a trio of even bigger luxury liners, the White Star \"Olympic\"-class capable of and Hapag \"Imperator\"-class capable of . Even Cunard chose this approach when it ordered its third superliner, the \"Aquitania\".\n\nThere is a persistent rumor that was attempting to win the Blue Riband and that such effort resulted in excessive speed and collision with the iceberg. Such a rumor is undoubtedly false, as the Titanic was built for luxury not speed.\n\nAs a result of the war, Hamburg American and Norddeutscher Lloyd lost their premier units. In 1926, the U.S. Government awarded Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) $27 million in compensation for its confiscated liners. By this time, improvements in turbine technology and hull form along with the use of fuel oil instead of coal made it possible to build more civilised record breakers. Using these funds, NDL ordered two ships designed to cross the Atlantic in five days, the and . However, the American government netted the award against debts owed by the German Government and Berlin was forced to directly subsidise NDL to continue the project. \"Bremen\" recorded on her 1929 Blue Riband voyage and \"Europa\" increased the Blue Riband to in 1933.\n\nIn 1928, as Britain's response to the German and , the White Star Line ordered a new Diesel-electric 1000-ft long ocean liner to be named \"Oceanic\" capable of 200,000 SHP. Construction started June 28, 1928. However, White Star did not have the funds to complete the liner. Oceanic's construction was put on hold until 1931 when her keel was silently scrapped. Oceanic's ahead-of-their-time engines would have been powerful enough to enable her to possibly win the Blue Riband.\n\nIn 1929, two lines from Italy each ordered a ship based on the German pair. Just as these ships were being completed, the Italian government nationalised the shipping industry, creating the Italian Line. While both superliners were successful, only the won the Blue Riband, with a 1933 voyage at .\n\nCGT also ordered a new superliner in 1929. The next year, Cunard started construction on an 80,000 ton liner that was to be the first of two record breakers fast enough to fit into a two ship weekly Southampton-New York service. Consequently, CGT altered its plans to make its new liner even bigger. However, as the 1929 shipping depression intensified, construction on Cunard’s hull 534 was halted while work on the heavily subsidised French ship continued. By 1934, both Cunard and White Star lines were failing and the British Government was concerned about potential job losses. Therefore, the government agreed to give Cunard a loan of £3 million to complete hull 534 as the and an additional £5 million to build a second ship, the only if Cunard merged with White Star.\n\nCGT's entered service in 1935 and won the Blue Riband at . \"Queen Mary\" was commissioned the next year, and after a few break-in voyages, took the Blue Riband to . The two liners were operated a pair and traded the Blue Riband again, with the Cunard White Star Liner ultimately posting in 1938. \"Queen Mary’s\" consort, \"Queen Elizabeth\", was commissioned after war was declared and was never allowed to attempt the record.\n\nIn 1935, Harold K. Hales (1868–1942), a member of the UK Parliament and owner of a shipping company, commissioned a large trophy to be presented to the fastest ship crossing the Atlantic, in order to formalize the rules surrounding the trans Atlantic competition. The rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the Blue Riband in that the trophy was to be awarded only to surface passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction. Other rule changes further complicated the situation, and eventually the trophy was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders; \"Rex\", in 1935, \"Normandie\" in 1936, and \"United States\" in 1952.\n\nOf the ships of state, only \"Queen Mary\", \"Queen Elizabeth\" and \"Europa\" survived the war. \"Europa\" became CGT's \"Liberte\" and no attempt was made to retain her former speed when she was reconstructed. However, the United States government was impressed by the large numbers of troops carried by the Queens during the war, and ordered a superliner that was as much a troop carrier as an express liner. On her maiden voyage in 1952, the \"United States\" upped the Blue Riband to . In 1958, the transatlantic airlines put jet transports into service and the days of the record breakers were numbered. \"Liberte\" retired in 1961, along with \"Queen Mary\" in 1967, and \"United States\" in 1969.\n\nWith the success of \"United States\" in 1952 and Cunard's decision not to challenge the new record the Blue Riband contest again subsided. There was a growing recognition that the era of fast crossings by express liners was becoming a thing of the past, and that the contest for fast transatlantic travel was shifting to the air.\n\nIn the 1930s, air travel was already competing with the express liners for fast Atlantic crossings; in 1936 the German company DELAG commenced an airship service to New York, their \"Hindenburg\" crossing from Europe to America in times ranging from 53 to 78 hours, and the following year, while experimenting with a flying boat service, Empire Airways \"Caledonia\" reduced this to 15 hours.\nIn the post-war period times were reduced again by the advent of land based airliners, such as the Lockheed Constellation. Hopes in 1952 were expressed for the new de Havilland Comet jetliner, though these were dashed by the succession of crashes that halted the Comet programme. A regular jetliner service was finally introduced in 1958 with the Boeing 707 and the DC 8, cutting the crossing to 7 hours. The final step in the quest for trans-Atlantic speed was the BAC Concorde, which set a record in 1996 of a second under two hours 53 minutes, at an average speed of 1250 mph (Mach 1.9), but by this time airlines were aware that cost and comfort were more important to passengers than speed, and the emphasis shifted to aircraft like the Boeing 747, with a sleeper capacity for business passengers.\nAt sea \"United States\" record stood until 1986, when it was challenged by British entrepreneur Richard Branson, and his high-speed motor vessel, \"Virgin Atlantic Challenger\". Despite having to stop to refuel on several occasions, Branson shaved two hours off the record, increasing the average speed to 36.4 knots. However, as \" Virgin Atlantic Challenger\" was not a passenger vessel the New York Maritime Museum refused to part with the Hales Trophy, so Branson inaugurated the Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy, for the fastest unqualified Atlantic crossing, open to all challengers. Three years later this was won by Tom Gentry, whose \"Gentry Eagle\" slashed the record, crossing in 62 hours at an average 47.4 knots. \nIn 1992 the Virgin Atlantic Challenge was again won, by the Aga Khan's \"Destriero\" crossing in 58 hour 34 minutes and averaging 53.09 knots. She also made a record-breaking return journey, winning the Columbus Atlantic Trophy, posted by the yacht club in response to the Virgin Atlantic Challenge for the fastest two-way voyage i.e. a single crossing and return voyage within a specified time.\n\nMeanwhile, Incat, builders of fast catamaran ferries, and therefore indisputably commercial vessels, decided to make an attempt to win the Hales Trophy, for which the record was still that of \"United States\". This was achieved in 1990 by \"Hoverspeed Great Britain\", with a non-stop crossing of 79 hours 54 minutes, averaging 36.6 knots and Incat were awarded the trophy by the Hales Trophy Committee. Eight years later this record was broken by another Incat vessel, \"Catalonia\" and again the following month by \"Cat-Link V\".\n\nThe Ocean Rowing Society inspired by The Blue Riband concept created Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an unsupported row boat. Presently it is the most sought after trophy of Ocean Rowing.\n\nWith the end of the express liners era the Blue Riband has become an item of largely historical interest, with some authors regarding the \"United States\" as the last holder of the accolade; meanwhile the goal of the fastest Atlantic crossings remains a physical and technological challenge and at least three awards for the feat remain in play.\n\nThe following is the latest consensus list of the research to date. Because there was no sanctioning body for the Blue Riband, researchers are limited to surviving shipping company archives and press reports to develop the list of Blue Riband winners. These lists are retrospective, and limited to steamships only. Therefore, most lists feature \"Sirius\", in her race with \"Great Western\" in 1838, as the first record-holder, although her crossing was not as fast as some sail packet ships of the period. Early writers including Arthur Maginnus (1892), Henry Frey (1896), Charles Lee (1931) and C. R. Benstead (1936) were the standard sources until the 1950s. Since then, C. R. Vernon Gibbs (1952), and Noel Bonsor (1975) added to the body of knowledge, with additional detail about the German ships provided by Arnold Kludas.\n\nOver the years, the lists have not agreed. For example, Gibbs credits Inman's \"City of Paris\" with an 1866 Blue Riband voyage, and Cunard's \"Russia\" with an eastbound record the following year because he considered as dubious \"Scotia's\" Blue Riband claim of , supposedly based on a very long track. Later writers have included the \"Scotia\" claim. Gibbs also includes the claimed Blue Riband voyage at of the National Line's \"America\" of 1884 that was not confirmed by later researchers.\n\n\n"}

The company manufactures food products in the United States and internationally — specializing in turkey, cured deli meats, raw roasts and specialty products such as soups and salads, sandwiches, and entrées.\n\nButterball LLC was a joint venture of Smithfield Foods and Maxwell Farms Inc., an affiliate of the Goldsboro Milling Co. Seaboard Corporation bought Smithfield's stake in Butterball in 2010. The company sells over one billion pounds of turkey a year. Though the \"Butterball\" brand has been formally recognized since 1940, Butterball LLC was formed in 2006.\n\nIn Canada, the rights to Butterball are owned by Exceldor Foods Ltd.\n\nAccording to Butterball, the following products are sold under the Butterball name:\n\n\n\nAmong numerous other brands, English-bred Butterball turkeys are sold in the United Kingdom during Christmas time for the Christmas feast.\n\nThe name Butterball was originally registered as trademark #378,438 on June 11, 1940, by Ada Walker of Wyoming, Ohio. Leo Peters purchased the trademark in February 1951. Leo Peters licensed the name to Swift and Co. for 10 years before selling it in the 1960s. Peters sold the name \"Butterball\" to Swift, which was acquired by ConAgra in 1990.\n\nLeo Peters retained rights to use the name Butterball Farms for his butter products and the company operates today as Butterball Farms, Inc., producing and marketing shaped butter products.\n\nIn October 2006, ConAgra's Butterball branded turkey business was sold to North Carolina-based Carolina Turkeys, making Carolina Turkey the largest turkey producer in the United States. The company, located southeast of Raleigh, NC in Mount Olive, North Carolina on the Wayne and Duplin county line, subsequently renamed itself Butterball LLC.\n\nIn 2008, the company moved its headquarters to a new $12 million building in Greenfield North off Interstate 40 in Garner, North Carolina. The headquarters has a \"customer experience center\" with a special kitchen for promotional demonstrations.\n\nSmithfield offered $200 million to Maxwell Farms for the portion of Butterball that Smithfield did not own. Chief executive C. Larry Pope said at that time that he hoped Maxwell Farms would spend more on the company's facilities and marketing. A decision had to be made whether to buy Maxwell's share or sell Smithfield's. On September 10, 2010, Smithfield announced the sale of its 49 percent share of Butterball for an estimated $175 million. Maxwell Farms will sell 50 percent of Butterball to Seaboard Corp.\n\nWalter “Gator” Pelletier, past chairman of the National Turkey Federation, is Butterball LLC's corporate secretary — managing all operating activities from turkey production and directing Maxwell Farms, the managing partner of Butterball. Pelletier is also president of Maxwell Farms, Inc., vice president of Goldsboro Milling Company, and secretary-treasurer of Maxwell Foods, Inc. Pelletier had joined Goldsboro Milling Company in 1981.\n\nBeginning in late 1981, Butterball has maintained a toll-free telephone line called the Turkey Talk-Line to help customers with cooking and preparation questions. Eleven thousand people called in 1981, and in recent years the number has grown to over 200,000 each holiday season. The most frequent question asked is how long a turkey takes to defrost.\n\nIn \"The West Wing\" episode \"The Indians in the Lobby\", President Josiah Bartlet calls the number (referred to as the \"Butterball Hotline\" in the script) to discuss stuffing and cooking his Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nAnimal welfare activists such as Mercy for Animals, the Humane Society of the United States, and PETA have accused Butterball of animal cruelty. These organizations cite intentional cruelty inflicted on the birds, as well as the incidental cruelty inherent in the slaughter methods used, and the breeding practices which produce animals too large to reproduce without human intervention.\n\nIn October 2012, a Mercy for Animals investigator documented a pattern of abuse and neglect at numerous Butterball turkey operations in North Carolina. The investigation revealed workers kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, and throwing turkeys onto the ground or on top of other birds; birds suffering from serious untreated illnesses and injuries, including open sores, infections, and broken bones; and workers grabbing birds by their wings or necks and violently slamming them into tiny transport crates with no regard for their welfare.\n\nThis investigation occurred less than one year after a Mercy for Animals undercover investigation into a different Butterball turkey facility led to five workers being charged with criminal cruelty to animals. Mercy for Animals’ 2011 investigation at a Butterball turkey factory farm in Shannon, Hoke County, North Carolina revealed Butterball workers violently kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, slamming them into transport crates, and leaving turkeys to suffer from serious untreated injuries and infections. As a result of the investigation, North Carolina officials raided the facility and arrested several employees.\n\nIn August 2012, Butterball worker Brian Douglas pleaded guilty to felony cruelty to animals—marking the first-ever felony conviction for cruelty to factory-farmed birds in United States history. Several days later, another Butterball employee, Rueben Mendoza, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and felony identity theft.\n\nIn February 2013, two more Butterball workers, Terry Johnson and Billy McBride, were found guilty of misdemeanor animal cruelty as a result of MFA's investigation.\n\nIn addition to the felony and misdemeanor cruelty convictions, MFA’s investigation at Butterball uncovered government corruption. Dr. Sarah Jean Mason, the director of Animal Health Programs with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, was arrested and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges after admitting to warning Butterball about the raid by law enforcement and potentially compromising the criminal cruelty investigation.\n\n\n"}

Patriciu was the leader of the parliamentary group of PL '93 and Partidul Alianța Civică.\n\nPatriciu was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of Bucharest in the Romanian local election, 1996.\n\nIn 2000, he was elected on the lists of PNL for the Prahova County. He resigned on 18 June 2003 due to incompatibility between public office and his private business interests.\n\nIn 1990, he founded the first private company in Romania, \"Alpha\", having architecture and constructions activities. \nThe following year, Patriciu's company began buying land in a northern district of Bucharest in order to build an apartment complex. A couple of octogenarians initially refused to sell, before reaching an agreement. Short time after this, the old man died and his wife disappeared, police being informed of this disappearance by a business associate of Patriciu. Not long after, the house was demolished and the land was taken over. Accused by the press of involvement in a murder, Patriciu denied any involvement and claimed that her death delayed the project.\n\nIn 2007, he bought the Fabian Romania Property Fund, a British real estate investment fund in Romania. As of 2012, his \"Dinu Patriciu Global Properties\" company owned real estate (office and commercial buildings) worth an estimated $1 billion in Germany and Romania, as well as 25 residential projects in the United Arab Emirates. He previously, in 2011, liquidated his worth €110 million portofolio of Swedish property, as well as some properties in Paris and Hague.\n\nIn 1998, he bought from the Romanian government the oil company Rompetrol. A year later, the company took over the Vega Ploiești oil refinery. In the same year, the headquarters of the company was moved to the Netherlands. In 2000, Rompetrol took over \"Petros\", Romania's only oil well services company at the time, renaming it \"Rompetrol Well Services\". In 2001, Petromidia Năvodari, the largest refinery in Romania was sold to Rompetrol for $50 million.\n\nThe 570 million € debt of Rompetrol to the Romanian state was converted in 2003 into bonds by the Adrian Năstase Government. In 2014, the Victor Ponta government erased the debt.\n\nDinu Patriciu sold 75% of the shares of Rompetrol to Kazakhstan's KazMunayGas for $2.7 billion in 2007, becoming the richest Romanian.\n\nPatriciu bought the \"Adevărul\" newspaper in 2006 and increased the holding's portfolio to include the \"Click!\" tabloid, the local edition of \"Forbes\", \"OK!\" and \"Foreign Policy\", as well as cultural magazine \"Dilema Veche\", women's magazine \"Tango\" and science popularization magazine \"Știință și Tehnică\". In 2012, he sold Adevărul Holding to Cristian Burci.\n\nTogether with former Georgian prime-minister Lado Gurgenidze, Patriciu bought the Liberty Bank (formerly \"People's Bank\").\n\nPatriciu attempted to build a convenience store chain named \"mic.ro\", however it quickly ended in bankruptcy, with over 45 million € debts to banks in addition to large debts to suppliers. According to Coface Romania, the development was done using credit from suppliers and banks, with almost no funding from the investors.\n\nIn May 2006, following an interrogation, Dinu Patriciu was arrested for 24 hours, being accused of tax evasion, money laundering and fraud. He was freed at the end of the 24 hours, as the judges refused to extend the warrant requested by the prosecutors. Patriciu accused the prosecutors of \"serving a reactionary interest group represented by General Ioan Talpeș and former president Ion Iliescu\". The Prosecutors' Body issued a communiqué in which they decried \"a gross interference of political parties in the case\", arguing that \"the fight against corruption must be carried to the end\".\n\nThe Directorate for the Investigation of Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) sent the case to court, being accused of seven felonies: embezzlement, money laundering, conspiracy, market manipulation, disclosure of privileged information and initiation or establishment of an organised crime ring. Patriciu was accused of being involved, as CEO of Rompetrol, in a case of embezzlement in 1999-2001. The company misappropriated an amount of $85 million that were owed to the state budget under EPSA agreements.\n\nIn 2007, President Traian Băsescu accused the then-Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu of sending him a note in 2005 asking to influence the political investigations of Dinu Patriciu, an ally of Popescu-Tăriceanu. Băsescu said that he did not make the note public earlier because he wanted not to derail the negotiations for the EU admission. The Prime-Minister admitted he sent the note, but claimed he just wanted that the President make sure that investigations were carried out correctly.\n\nPatriciu and the other defendants were acquitted in 2012 during the first trial, in a verdict that was later overturned following an appeal of the prosecutors. The Court of Appeals sentenced in 2014 several of his associates to prison, including PNL Senator Sorin Roșca Stănescu and Alexandru Bucșa, a former vice-president of Rompetrol Netherlands.\n\nWhile the criminal case against Patriciu was ended due to his death, the civil case continues.\n\nPatriciu was diagnosed with cirrhosis and he underwent a liver transplant in Milan in 2012. He was later diagnosed with lymphoma.\n\nPatriciu died on 19 August 2014, aged 64 at the Royal Free Hospital in London due to a lung infection after spending several days in hospital. He was buried in the Bucharest Bellu cemetery, in a private ceremony.\n"}

{"id": "9952504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9952504", "title": "Hasib Sabbagh", "text": "Hasib Sabbagh\n\nHasib Sabbagh (), (also spelled Hassib) (1920 – 12 January 2010) was a Palestinian businessman, activist, and philanthropist.\n\nSabbagh came from a Palestinian Christian family in Safed in Palestine, although he was born in Tiberias. He graduated from the Arab College of Jerusalem in 1938, and in 1941 gained a civil engineering degree from the American University of Beirut.\n\nSabbagh attended the Government Arab College of Jerusalem, which only the top public school students in Palestine attended. It was headed by Ahmad Samih al-Khalidi and staffed by some of the finest teachers in the Arab world. It was a boarding school with regimental discipline, where the highest standards were set for the students. They were expected to study night and day, and were allowed only one day off for sports and other recreation. It was there that he established some of the friendships that have lasted to this day.\n\nIn 1938 Sabbagh enrolled at the American University of Beirut, as a sophomore, in the college of engineering; attending AUB was to be one of the more significant experiences of his life. Not only was he being trained for his future profession, but he was also exposed to a rich and varied political life. AUB students came from throughout the Arab world, and represented many political currents: there were the Syrian nationalists, followers of Antun Sa'adeh, the communists led by Khalid Bikdash, the Arab nationalists whose ideologue was Professor Constantine Zureik of AUB, and the Arab Ba‘thists who adhered to Michel ‘Aflaq’s ideas.\n\nSabbagh died on 12 January 2010 after a long illness.\n\nIn 1970, Sabbagh met Yasser Arafat, chairman of the PLO, at the house of a mutual friend, Abdul Majid Shoman, in Beirut. Since that time, he developed a close relationship with Arafat and other members of the PLO leadership. Sabbagh, Basel Aql, and Walid Khalidi became intermediaries between the PLO and the Lebanese government, trying to inform and explain the complexity of Lebanese confessional politics to Arafat and his colleagues and interceding on behalf of Palestinian refugees with the Lebanese authorities. It was the Lebanese civil war, however, that made Sabbagh an activist — an activist for peace and reconciliation between the various Lebanese parties and between the Palestinians and the Lebanese.\n\nSabbagh recognized the danger of the situation in Lebanon when, in April 1975, twenty-six Palestinians were shot to death by Phalangist forces in ‘Ayn al-Rumanah, in retaliation for the assassination of two of their bodyguards. The next day, he met with Abu Iyad, the PLO’s second in command, at Walid Khalidi’s house. The Palestinian leadership had also understood the potential threat to Lebanese — Palestinian relations this incident portended. Abu Iyad asked Sabbagh to convince the Maronite patriarch, Antonius Butrus Khraysh, to condemn the killing publicly in order to preempt a further deterioration of the situation. Sabbagh, accompanied by a member of the Phalangist party, visited the patriarch, who agreed to make a statement on the radio that same evening condemning the killings. Sabbagh also asked the patriarch to invite both Pierre Gemayel, the leader of the Phalangist party, and Arafat for lunch at the patriarchate to effect a reconciliation between them and their communities. The invitation was accepted by Gemayel, but Arafat declined, saying that it was too soon after the ‘Ayn al-Rumanah killings to meet with Gemayel. Sabbagh strongly believed that had that meeting occurred between the two leaders at the onset of the conflict, it may have prevented much of the bloodshed and disaster that took place in the following days, months, and even years. Sabbagh was involved in many other efforts to bring leaders of the various factions together in order to resolve conflicts or prevent their escalation.\nThroughout the war, Sabbagh acted as intermediary and mediator, trying to find solutions to the conflict that was destroying the country. He passed messages from the PLO to the United States administration and back to the PLO (although he was not the only channel that Arafat used to communicate with the United States). In 1982, after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Sabbagh accompanied by Munib al-Masri and Abdul Majid Shoman, went to Saudi Arabia to ask King Khalid to intercede with the United States in an effort to stop Israel’s bombing of Beirut, to allow the PLO to leave the city. When the bombing stopped, Sabbagh was instrumental in passing information from the PLO to the United States about the PLO’s conditions for its peaceful departure from Beirut.\n\nA longtime member of both the Palestine National Council and of its central council, Sabbagh provided crucial international contacts for Arafat during the 1970s and 1980s. Most controversially, his 1978 meeting with the Phalange, first agreed to and then denounced by Arafat, provoked condemnation from the Lebanese and Syrian governments as well as from Palestinian opposition groups. In 1988, his active support encouraged Arafat to steer the Palestine Liberation Organization firmly toward a renewed peace initiative.\n\nIn 1943, with four other contractors, he established the Consolidated Contractors Company (CCC) in Haifa. Sabbagh left Palestine in April 1948 and moved to Lebanon. CCC was reestablished there in 1950, becoming the region's largest multinational and one of the largest contractors worldwide. Sabbagh was a billionaire and ranked 16th on the world's richest Arabs.\n\nThrough the Diana Sabbagh Foundation, one of the largest Arab charitable foundations, Sabbagh has supported institutions of higher education across the Arab world and the West, and has influenced a range of dialogue initiatives, notably in the United States at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Carter Center, and the Center for Muslim - Christian Encounter, and in Palestine within the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy (MIFTAH), under Hanan Ashrawi. He also co-founded the Welfare Association for Palestinians, chaired the Palestinian Students Fund, and has been on the boards of the Arab Bank and of many academic institutions and pro-Palestinian think tanks, such as the Institute of Palestine Studies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56921904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56921904", "title": "History of children in the military", "text": "History of children in the military\n\nChildren in the military are children (defined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child as persons under the age of 18) who are associated with military organizations, such as state armed forces and non-state armed groups. Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been involved in military campaigns. For example, thousands of children participated on all sides of the First World War and the Second World War. Children may be trained and used for combat, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, or used for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda.\n\nChildren are easy targets for military recruitment due to their greater susceptibility to influence compared to adults. Some children are recruited by force while others choose to join up, often to escape poverty or because they expect military life to offer a rite of passage to maturity.\n\nThroughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military campaigns.\n\nThe earliest mentions of minors being involved in wars come from antiquity. It was customary for youths in the Mediterranean basin to serve as aides, charioteers and armor bearers to adult warriors. Examples of this practice can be found in the Bible, such as David's service to King Saul, in Hittite and ancient Egyptian art, and in ancient Greek mythology (such as the story of Hercules and Hylas), philosophy and literature. In a practice dating back to antiquity, children were routinely taken on a campaign, together with the rest of a military man's family, as part of the baggage.\n\nThe Roman Empire made use of youths in war, though it was understood that it was unwise and cruel to use children in war, and Plutarch implies that regulations required youths to be at least sixteen years of age. Despite this, several Roman legionaries were known to have enlisted aged 14 in the Imperial Roman army, such as Quintus Postunius Solus who completed 21 years of service in Legio XX Valeria Victrix, and Caecilius Donatus who served 26 years in the Legio XX and died shortly before his honorable discharge.\n\nIn medieval Europe young boys from about twelve years of age were used as military aides (\"squires\"), though in theory their role in actual combat was limited. The so-called Children's Crusade in 1212 recruited thousands of children as untrained soldiers under the assumption that divine power would enable them to conquer the enemy, although none of the children entered combat. According to the legend, they were instead sold into slavery. While most scholars no longer believe that the Children's Crusade consisted solely, or even mostly, of children, it nonetheless exemplifies an era in which entire families took part in a war effort.\n\nYoung boys often took part in battles during early modern warfare. When Napoleon was faced with invasion by a massive Allied force in 1814 he conscripted many teenagers for his armies. Orphans of the Imperial Guard fought in the Netherlands with Marshal MacDonald and were between the ages of 14 and 17. Many of the conscripts who reported to the ranks in 1814 were referred to as Marie Louises after the Empress Marie Louise of France; they were also known as \"The Infants of the Emperor\". These soldiers were in their mid-teens. One of their more visible roles was as the ubiquitous \"drummer boy\".\n\nDuring the age of sail, young boys formed part of the crew of British Royal Navy ships and were responsible for many essential tasks including bringing powder and shot from the ship's magazine to the gun crews. These children were called \"powder monkeys.\"\n\nDuring the American Civil War a young boy, Bugler John Cook, served in the US Army at the age of 15 and received the Medal of Honor for his acts during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American history. Several other minors, including 11-year-old Willie Johnston, have also received the Medal of Honor.\n\nBy a law signed by Nicholas I of Russia in 1827 a disproportionate number of Jewish boys, known as the cantonists, were forced into military training establishments to serve in the army. The 25-year conscription term officially commenced at the age of 18, but boys as young as eight were routinely taken to fulfill the quota. \n\nIn the final stages of the Paraguayan War, children fought in the Battle of Acosta Ñu against the Allied forces of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The day is commemorated as a national holiday in Paraguay.\n\nDuring the Boshin War, the pro-\"shōgun\" Aizu Domain formed the , which was made up of the 16 to 17-year-old sons of Aizu samurai. During the Battle of Bonari Pass and the Battle of Aizu they fought the Satcho forces who supported the Imperial cause. A detached unit of Byakkotai was cut off from the rest of the unit and retreated to Iimori Hill, which overlooked Aizu-Wakamatsu Castle. From there, they saw what they thought was the castle on fire. 20 of the detached unit committed \"seppuku\" while one was unsuccessful. He was saved by a local peasant.\n\nThe youngest known soldier of World War I was Momčilo Gavrić, who joined the 6th Artillery Division of the Serbian Army at the age of 8, after Austro-Hungarian troops in August 1914 killed his parents, grandmother, and seven of his siblings.\n\nIn the West, boys as young as 12 were caught up in the overwhelming tide of patriotism and in huge numbers enlisted for active service. Others enlisted to avoid harsh and dreary lives. Typically many were able to pass themselves off as older men, such as George Thomas Paget, who at 17 joined a Bantam battalion in the Welsh Regiment. The last surviving combat veteran of the War was Claude Choules, who enlisted in the Royal Navy at age 14 and saw his first action at the Battle of Jutland at 15. In the Gallipoli campaign, otherwise known as \"Çanakkale\", children as young as 15 fought in the trenches. 120 children fought in the \"15'liler\" or \"The 15s\" company, with no known survivors.\n\nMany child soldiers fought in the Spanish Civil War:\n\nIn World War II children under the age of 18 were widely used by all sides in formal and informal military roles. Children were readily indoctrinated into the prevailing ideology of the warring parties, quickly trained, and often sent to the front line; many were wounded or killed. The lack of a legal definition of a child, combined with the absence of a system for verifying the ages of prospective child recruits, contributed to the extensive use of children in the war.\n\nThese are historical examples. For instances of children in the military today, see Children in the military.\n\nDuring the Algerian civil war (1991–2002) children were recruited frequently by Islamist armed groups fighting the government. A government-allied militia—the Legitimate Defence Groups (LDG)—also used children, according to some reports. Although the rules for joining the LDG were the same as the army, in which only adults were recruited (by conscription) the LDG applied no safeguards to ensure that children could not join up. The extent of child recruitment during the war remains unknown.\n\nChildren were kidnapped and used extensively during the civil war of 1993–2005. In 2004 hundreds of child soldiers were in the Forces Nationales pour la Libération (FNL), an armed rebel, Hutu group. Children between the ages of 10 and 16 were also conscripted by the Burundese military.\n\nAfter the Arusha peace accord of 2001 and the Pretoria agreement of 2003 eventually brought the conflict to an end in 2005, the new constitution committed to not using children in direct combat. The parties to the conflict no longer recruited children in large numbers, but many remained active in the FNL, which had denounced the peace accord.\n\nBy 2006, a reintegration program organized by UNICEF had led to the release of 3,000 children from the military and armed groups. According to Child Soldiers International:The majority of those [children] who took part in the program returned to farm and fish in their local communities, but nearly 600 returned to school. Some 1,800 former child soldiers received occupational training. Health care was provided for those with special needs and psychosocial support was provided through individual and group meetings., Burundi no longer appears on the UN list of countries where children are used in hostilities.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2012, children were used extensively by the Chadian military as participants in armed conflict. They were also integrated into various rebel forces, including the United Front for Democratic Change (\"Front Uni pour le Changement\", FUC), local self-defense forces known as \"Tora Boro\" militias, and two Sudanese rebel movements operating in Chad: the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the G-19 faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA). After the government signed an action plan with the United Nations, children were released from service and were no longer recruited. By 2014, Chad had been removed from the UN list of countries that use child soldiers in war.\n\nDuring Côte d’Ivoire’s civil war of 2002–2004, \"children were recruited, often forcibly, by both sides\", and were also abducted by armed groups fighting the civil war in Liberia between 1999 and 2003. The \"Patriotic Youth –\" armed groups that included children in large numbers – received the active support of the government. Thousands of children saw membership of an armed group on either side of the war as a way to earn a living, although they were often unpaid, having to acquire money through extortion or begging. They were provided with automatic weapons, and girls were frequently abducted as sex slaves.\n\nAttempts to reach a peace agreement repeatedly failed, and although after 2006 children were gradually released from military groups, approximately 2,000 children remained. After President Laurent Gbagbo refused to recognise the 2010 election result, fighting flared up again and child recruitment increased. Under the new government, however, the UN brokered an Action Plan that included the release of all children and, in 2015, the UN reported that children were no longer recruited in the country.\n\nDuring its 30-year war for independence with Ethiopia (1961–1991) the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front was \"widely acknowledged\" to have used children extensively as soldiers, according to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International). Once independence had been won, the Eritrean armed forces recruited and used children again during the two-year border war with Ethiopia in 1998. There were many reports of child recruitment and use (including conscription from age 15), but there is little information today about the extent of the practice, which is due in part to the absence of effective birth registration and age-verification system at the time.\n\nThe UN reported in 2002 that children were no longer being used systematically by the Eritrean armed forces, and the government acceded to the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2005. Child recruitment continued, however; Human Rights Concern Eritrea reported in 2013 that all schoolchildren in 11 grade (approx. age 16) were made to spend the year at a military training camp, after which they were routinely recruited into the armed forces.\n\nAccording to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers in 2001 there were \"credible reports\" that the Ethiopian armed forces used thousands of children in its two-year border war with Eritrea between 1998 and 2000:Testimonies of former child soldiers, NGOs and journalists provide evidence of child deployment on the front lines and in massive waves across mine fields... Recruitment reportedly focused on Oromos and Somalis... and on grades 9 to 12 of secondary schools.Children were also forcibly recruited in groups from public places. The lack of a functioning birth registration system has made it difficult to estimate the number of children affected, but it is clear that the use of children was widespread; for example, most Ethiopian prisoners of war in one large prisoner of war camp in Eritrea were estimated to be aged 14–18.\n\nThe main opposition group in the 1990s, the Oromo Liberation Front, also systematically recruited children, including by force.\n\nIn 2008 it was reported that children were no longer used for military purposes in Ethiopia, and in 2014 the government ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.\n\nIn Liberia’s civil wars (1989–1995, 1999–2003) all factions abducted children for direct combat, forced labour, and sexual slavery. It was the common practice of commanders to give children drugs and threaten them with execution in order to enhance their obedience; for example, soldiers were frequently given valium before a battle, known as \"bubbles\" or \"10-10\". Children were often persuaded or forced to commit grave human rights violations against civilians, including rape, torture, and the abduction of other children for military use. Children as young as 10 were used in direct combat.\n\nUnited Nations disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programs repeatedly failed when children quitted them, often to return to their former military unit, and after fighters rioted in protest at the absence of a financial reward for being disarmed. A chronic lack of resources for reintegration also prompted child soldiers to enrol in other armed groups as a means of gainful employment. By 2004 more than 20,000 children needed to be demobilised and reunited with their communities. However, by October 2004 10,000 children had been released from their military units and were part of reintegration programs. \n\nBy 2006 children were no longer being used by any military groups in the country, although armed groups from Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea continued to abduct Liberian children. , children were no longer being used for military purposes in Liberia, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18. \n\nThe use of child soldiers in Liberia was epitomised by The Small Boys Unit, established by Liberian President Charles Taylor. The boys were not provided with sustenance, but were expected to engage in \"snake patrol\", looting surrounding villages. Taylor and others were later tried before the Special Court for Sierra Leone because of his involvement in recruiting child soldiers.\n\nAn estimated 20,000 children took part in hostilities during the 1990s, including the 1994 Rwanda genocide when many children were involved in committing atrocities. 5,000 children were in the national army, while others, including many street children, joined or were made to join armed groups. After the genocide, 4,500 children were detained on suspicion of participating in atrocities, and were incarcerated for several years without charge or trial; some were sent to the Gitagata Re-Education Centre for males below 14 years of age. In the late 1990s, children were widely recruited again, often by force, to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nInitial demobilisation and reintegration programmes failed after many schools banned former child soldiers and a high rate of unemployment rendered them vulnerable to re-recruitment by militia groups. In 2003, as the Rwandan military presence in the DRC reduced, so did the demand for child soldiers. The government introduced new legislation to raise the minimum enlistment age 18 and the armed forces stopped recruiting children. Nonetheless, armed groups continued to do so, albeit to a reduced extent, for their operations in the DRC.\n\nDuring the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002) thousands of children were recruited by government armed forces and non-government armed groups, particularly the anti-government Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), and the pro-government Civil Defence Forces (CDF).\n\nChildren were often forcibly recruited, given drugs and used to commit atrocities. Thousands of girls were also recruited as soldiers and often subjected to sexual exploitation. Many of the children were survivors of attacks on villages, which were routinely ordered to hand over their children to armed groups. By 2001, an estimated 10,000 children were being used for military purposes by government armed forces and various armed groups, particularly the RUF.\n\nAfter 2002, when the war was declared over, an extensive United Nations disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme reunited most former child soldiers with their communities, although it drew criticism for neglecting the needs of women and girls.\n\nIn June 2007 the Special Court for Sierra Leone found three men from the rebel Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, including the recruitment of children under the age of 15 years into the armed forces. With this the Special Court became the first ever UN-backed tribunal to secure a conviction for the military conscription of children. \n\n, children were no longer being used for military purposes in Sierra Leone, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18.\n\nIn his book \"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Child Soldier\", Ishmael Beah chronicles his life during the conflict in Sierra Leone. In \"Armies of the Young: Child Soldiers in War and Terrorism\" anthropologist David M. Rosen discusses the murders, rapes, tortures, and thousands of amputations committed by the RUF Small Boys Unit. The film \"Blood Diamond\" is set during the civil war. The issue is also explored in the \"Bones\" episode, \"The Survivor In The Soap\".\n\nOver a period of twenty years the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has abducted more than 30,000 boys and girls as soldiers or sex slaves. Joseph Kony began the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in 1987, originally to protect northern Ugandans from the 1986 military coup by the People's National Resistance Army. Stating that he \"received messages from God\" Kony began attacking his own people, the Acholi, to establish a new theocratic government in Uganda based on the principles of the \"Ten Commandments of God\". This attempt by the LRA to gain control of the Ugandan government via roaming armies used boy- as well as girl-children as soldiers, such as Grace Akallo.\n\nThe LRA expansion into South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo has used large numbers of children as active combatants and participants in extreme violence. On the 21October 2008 an appeal by the UN Security Council was made asking for the LRA to cease all military action in the DRC immediately. On 14June 2002 Uganda deposited its instrument of ratification of the Rome Statute, and on 16December 2003 the Government of Uganda referred the situation concerning northern Uganda to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC investigated the situation and on 14October 2005 issued indictments against Lord's Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony and four other commanders for war crimes: Vincent Otti; Raska Lukwiya (indictment terminated, deceased); Okot Odhiambo; and Dominic Ongwen. The warrant for Kony, Otti and Odhiambo includes the alleged crime of the forced enlisting of children contrary to the Rome Statute Art. 8(2) (e)(vii).\n\nThe National Resistance Army also made use of child soldiers. Between 2003 and 2007, non-state armed groups fighting the LRA also used children.\n\nIn 2007 the Ugandan government agreed an action plan with the UN to end the use of child soldiers and in 2008 the country no longer appeared on the UN list of countries that recruit and use children.\n\nDuring the civil war between 1980 and 1992 the Salvadoran military and the main opposition group, the \"Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación National\" (FMLN)\",\" recruited children extensively. The recruitment was frequently carried out by force and focused on economically suppressed regions. A fifth of the army’s personnel were aged under 18, as were a quarter of the FMLN. In a group of 278 former FMLN child soldiers interviewed for a study, the average age of recruitment was 10 years. The large majority of child recruits on both sides were living in poverty, and had been largely deprived of formal education. Many children who were not recruited by force joined of their own volition, mainly either to improve their circumstances or because they believed in the cause. \n\nAfter the civil war came to a close, rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for children mostly failed; the majority of FMLN children were not involved in them, and the large majority of those who were dropped out of them. A decade after the peace accord former child soldiers were still experiencing nightmares, depression, anxiety, and related signs of psychiatric trauma. \n\nToday, the Salvadoran military no longer sends children to war, but it still recruits and trains them from the age of 16.\n\nDuring the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) the armed forces used children widely; the extent of the practice is not known but the number of children involved is thought to be in the tens of thousands. Armed groups associated with the government advertised widely for children from age 14 to join them, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, urged children to fight at the front. According to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International):Ayatollah Khomeini declared that parental permission was unnecessary for those going to the front, that volunteering for military duty was a religious obligation, and that serving in the armed forces took priority over all other forms of work or study. Various sources reported that children were indoctrinated into participating in combat. They were given \"keys to paradise\" and promised that they would go directly to heaven if they died as martyrs against the Iraqi enemy.The children involved were overwhelmingly from slums and poor villages, and some participated without the knowledge of their parents, including Mohammad Hossein Fahmideh. Thousands of children took part in human wave attacks, leading to widespread deaths and injuries. The total number of all Iranian casualties is estimated to be 200,000–600,000, of which approximately a third were aged 15–19 (and 3 percent under 14), according to one assessment.\n\nAfter the war, the \"Basij,\" an official militia organisation, continued to recruit children from age 15, focusing on those living in poverty and sometimes recruiting them by force. In 2004, the \"Basij\" was estimated to have as many as a million members of all ages. \"Ansar-e Hizbollah\", an armed group tolerated by the government, also recruited children widely in the 2000s, with no age restriction. , the Iranian armed forces continue to enlist from age 16 and the government has not yet ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.\n\nThe government of Saddam Hussein maintained 'boot camps' of civilian youths between the ages of 12 and 17 that involved small arms training and Ba'athist political indoctrination. Iraqi opposition sources and the US State Department reported that children who refused faced punishment. The state incorporated children as young as ten into the \"Futuwah\" and \"Ashbal Saddam\" youth movements and then subjected them to military training, sometimes for 14 hours a day. P. W. Singer has compared the groups to the \"Hitler Jugend\". In the Gulf War 12-year-old boys fought for the Iraqis. Children also participated in the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nIn the 2003 invasion of Iraq, US forces fought children at Nasariya, Karbala, and Kirkuk, and the US sent captured child combatants to Abu Ghraib prison. In 2009 a UN report on the post-war Iraqi occupation stated that the Iraqi insurgency had used children as combatants; it noted, for example, a suicide attack against Kirkuk's police commander by a boy aged between 10 and 13. \n\nIn the 1970s the \"Khmer Rouge\" exploited thousands of desensitised, conscripted children in their early teens to commit mass murder and other atrocities during the Cambodian civil war and subsequent genocide. The indoctrinated children were taught to follow any order without hesitation. After it was deposed in 1979, the \"Khmer Rouge\" fought a guerrilla war against the new government, and until at least 1998 relied heavily on child recruits, including forced recruitment by abduction. During this period, the children were deployed mainly in unpaid support roles, such as ammunition-carriers, and also as combatants.\n\nCambodia's state armed forces also recruited children widely. Throughout the 1990s the army was recruiting children from the age of 10 and using them in armed conflict, mainly as porters and spies, and also as combatants. Four percent of the army were children, according to an estimate in the \"Cambodia Daily\". Many children had fled the \"Khmer Rouge\" without a means to feed themselves and hoped that joining the government forces would enable them to survive, although local commanders frequently denied them any pay. Children often capitalised on the lack of an effective birth registration system to lie about their age in order to enlist. Other children, some as young as 8, were forced to join.\n\nBy 2000, the Cambodian government had signed the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and its armed forces resolved to recruit adults only. Meanwhile, the \"Khmer Rouge\" had collapsed with the death of its leader, Pol Pot, in 1998. By 2004, children were no longer being recruited in the country, although the demobilisation programmes were inadequate, according to UNICEF, failing to offer appropriate rehabilitative support to released children.\n\nBetween 1983 and 2009 Sri Lanka’s government fought a civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers). For its entire duration the Tamil Tigers and other armed groups made routine use of child recruits, typically aged 14–17 and sometimes under 10. Some children enlisted to escape deprivation or racism, or during compulsory military training at their school when they were exposed to recruitment propaganda. Others were recruited by force when walking home from school or after the Tigers pressurised families to surrender one child, as per its policy. In 2001, international sources estimated that 40 percent of Tamil Tiger personnel were children, contrary to official statements insisting that the organisation did not use them. Sri Lankan soldiers nicknamed one unit the \"Baby Battalion\", due to the number of children in it. Although state armed forces recruited only adults over the age of 18, they supported the Karuna group, a Tamil splinter organisation opposed to the Tamil Tigers, to recruit children by force. The government also used detained Tamil Tiger children for propaganda by exposing them to the media.\n\nThe first international initiative to demobilise and reintegrate children into their communities began in 2003, but was halted in 2004 because the Tigers failed to keep their commitment to release children from their ranks. The organisation began to release children in 2004, but continued to enlist several thousand, albeit in progressively smaller numbers, until at least 2007. The Tamil Tigers were defeated in 2009 and all other parties to the conflict stopped recruiting children in the same year.\n\nDuring the First Chechen War, Chechen separatist forces included a large number of boys and girls, some as young as 11. According to the UN: \"Child soldiers in Chechnya were reportedly assigned the same tasks as adult combatants, and served on the front lines soon after joining the armed forces.\" In 2004 under-18s were still believed to be involved in a range of armed groups in the war against Russia; some allegedly took part in suicide bombings.\n\nChildren aged 17 were sent to the Falklands War in 1982 (where three were killed) and the Gulf War in 1990–91 (where two were killed). 17-year-olds were also deployed as NATO peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. Having initially resisted international negotiations to prevent the deployment of children, the UK agreed to deploy adults only when it signed the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict in 2000, but remained committed to recruiting and training children from age 16. Between 2003 and 2010 22 personnel aged 17 were sent to Afghanistan and Iraq, reportedly in error.\n\nDuring the Troubles in Northern Ireland (c. 1960s to 1998) it was common for paramilitary groups to recruit and use children, including as combatants. Five children in Republican paramilitary groups, seven in Loyalist paramilitary groups, and five in the British armed forces, died during the conflict. The youngest, Cathleen McCartland, was recruited by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and was aged 12 when she was killed in Belfast.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8547520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8547520", "title": "Johnny Kitagawa", "text": "Johnny Kitagawa\n\n, is a Japanese-American businessman and talent manager. He is the founder and president of Johnny & Associates, a production agency for numerous popular boy bands in Japan. Kitagawa assembled, produced and managed more than a dozen popular bands, including Tanokin Trio, Hey! Say! JUMP, SMAP, Arashi, Kanjani8, V6, NEWS and KAT-TUN. Kitagawa's influence has spread beyond music to the realms of theatre and television. Regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Japanese entertainment industry, he has held a virtual monopoly on the creation of boy bands in Japan for more than 40 years.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2000, Kitagawa was the subject of a number of claims that he had taken advantage of his position to engage in improper sexual relationships with boys under contract to his talent agency. Kitagawa denied these claims, and in 2002 was awarded an 8.8 million yen judgment against the magazine that had published such allegations. An appeal by the magazine followed, resulting in a partial reversal of the judgment. The Tokyo High Court reduced the damages to ¥1.2 million, concluding that the reports of drinking and smoking were defamatory but that the allegations of sexual exploitation of adolescent boys by Johnny Kitagawa were true. A 2004 appeal to the Supreme Court by Kitagawa was rejected.\n\nBorn in 1928 in Los Angeles, California, United States, Kitagawa returned with his family to Japan in 1933. His father Taido was a Buddhist priest and was the third head bishop of the Koyasan Buddhist Temple in Little Tokyo from 1924 to 1933. Johnny went to America about 1949. In the early 1950s, he returned to Japan to work at the United States Embassy. While walking through Tokyo's Yoyogi Park he encountered a group of boys playing baseball. He recruited them to form a singing group, acting as their manager. He named the group \"The Johnnies\". The Johnnies achieved a measure of success by using a then-novel formula of mixing attractive performers singing popular music with coordinated dance routines. The Johnnies were the first all-male pop group in Japan, and set the pattern that Kitagawa would follow with his subsequent acts. Indeed, the term \"Johnnies\" would come to apply generically to any of the performers under Kitagawa's employ.\n\nIn 1968, Kitagawa achieved wider success with a four-member boy band known as . The song and dance group met with success, as reflected by seven consecutive appearances on the annual invitation-only , beginning in 1970. Four Leaves performed together for ten years before disbanding in 1978. Later, in 2002, Kitagawa oversaw the band's reunion. Kitagawa went on to assemble, produce and manage many of the top all-male bands in the country, including groups such as Hey! Say! JUMP, SMAP, Tokio, V6, Arashi, Tackey & Tsubasa, Kanjani8, NEWS, KAT-TUN, KinKi Kids and among many others. Kitagawa was able to expand his sphere of influence to include television, as his performers regularly appear on television, with many appearing on their own variety programs. They also regularly act as pitchmen for commercial products, and appear in movies. The success of Kitagawa's performers led to increased profitability, as Johnny & Associates generated 2.9 billion yen in annual profits at the height of the boy band boom. During 1997, performers belonging to the talent agency appeared in more than 40 television programs and another 40 commercials. The success of his company has made Kitagawa one of the richest men in Japan.\n\nKitagawa repeatedly has employed a standard formula in the development and marketing of his acts. Johnny & Associates holds open tryouts for potential performers. The production agency recruits boys as young as ten into a talent pool known as Johnny's Juniors. Successful applicants live in a company dormitory and attend a company-run school. They train to hone their showmanship in the form of singing, dancing and acting. Kitagawa holds an annual summer festival known as \"Johnny's Summary\". Promising members of Johnny's Jr. appear alongside of established members of Kitagawa's fold. The junior members act as background dancers for the major acts to allow for name recognition prior to being launched as a separate group. The members of the Juniors also appear in on \"Hachi-ji da J\", a weekly television variety show. Members sing, dance, and perform in comedic sketches as they further develop the skills to graduate to a major act. Kitagawa's focus is on the development of his group as complete entertainers. Shonentai, for example, did not release a single until it had been together for more than seven years. \"I'm not very interested in records,\" Kitagawa said in a 1996 interview. \"Once you release a record, you have to sell that record. You have to push one song only. You can't think of anything else. It's not good for the artist.\" \n\nOnce launched, Kitagawa has been known to use his established groups to induce television stations to report on his newer acts, and ensure favorable press coverage for his acts and himself. Programs that give unfavorable coverage do not receive interviews or television appearance from popular stars managed by Kitagawa.\nKitagawa maintains a high degree of control over his acts, to the extent that their images do not appear on the company website. Performers are expected to maintain a public image that is conducive to marketing to young women; as a result, members of bands produced by Kitagawa avoid public mention of their private lives. Kitagawa himself avoids the public spotlight as well. He rarely permits his photograph to be taken, and does not make public appearances with his groups.\n\nRumors concerning Kitagawa and possible sexual harassment of the youth in his employ had surrounded the agency since 1988, when , a former member of Four Leaves, published a series of diaries under the title . Kita claimed that Kitagawa had used his position of influence over the group to make unwanted sexual advances towards the boys under contract to him. Similar allegations were made in a book published in 1996 by Junya Hiramoto, a former member of another of Kitagawa's bands. Hiramoto alleged that he had seen Kitagawa force a boy to have sex with him in one of the talent agency's dormitories.\nLater, in 1999, the weekly magazine printed a ten-part series that detailed numerous allegations of sexual improprieties. The accusers were a dozen teenage boys who had been recruited into the Johnny & Associates organization, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In addition, the series also accused Kitagawa of permitting minors in his employ to drink alcohol and smoke. The accusations prompted international newspaper coverage.\n\nThe controversy resulted in Yoshihide Sakaue, a member of the Parliament, holding a hearing on the matter in April, 2000. Sakaue said that as a result of the media coverage, and in response to a request from a constituent, he wanted to examine whether government officials had properly investigated complaints about Kitagawa. Officials of the National Police Agency acknowledged that they had investigated Kitagawa's agency, but had not determined that sexual harassment had occurred. Officials did indicate that Kitagawa's company was warned about permitting minors to use alcohol and smoke cigarettes. The National Police and Welfare Ministry indicated that under the Ministry's understanding of the law, even if the allegations against Kitagawa were true, the acts could not be considered child abuse because Kitagawa was neither parent nor guardian to the boys in his employ. In addition, officials testified that neither the boys nor their parents had pursued a criminal complaint against Kitagawa. Kitagawa denied any wrongdoing, and his attorney characterized the claims as being from disgruntled former employees voicing discontent. Kitagawa sued \"Shukan Bunshun\" for libel. Other than \"Shukan Bunshun\", none of the major Japanese media covered the story of the allegations against Kitagawa, the hearing in Parliament, or the Kitagawa lawsuit. \"The New York Times\" attributed this lack of coverage to Kitagawa's influence over the popular media. Once \"Shukan Bunshun\" began publication of the series, Johnny & Associates denied the magazine, and the other media owned by its parent organization, access to any of its performers.\n\nAfter protracted litigation, in 2002 the Tokyo District Court awarded Kitagawa an 8.8 million yen judgment against \"Shukan Bunshun\", finding that the articles defamed him. \"Shukan Bunshun\" appealed the ruling. In a partial reversal of the district court, the Tokyo High Court in 2003 ruled that the \"Shukan Bunshun\" series did in fact defame Kitagawa; however, it ruled that the defamatory content of the articles was limited to the allegations that Kitagawa had provided minors with alcohol and tobacco products. The court found that the \"Shukan Bunshun\" had sufficient reason to accept as trustworthy, and publish, the sexual allegations by Kitagawa's former clients. Kitagawa appealed this decision to the Supreme Court, but in 2004 it rejected his appeal.\n\nIn 2006, the boy band KAT-TUN was promoted to major band status and has all their 20 singles, DVD releases and 6 studio albums to date reach #1 on the prestigious Oricon music charts; the Japanese equivalent of the American \"Billboard\" Hot 100 music charts. In 2007, temporary Johnny's Jr. group, Hey! Say! 7, broke a record as the youngest male group to ever top Oricon charts, with an average age of 14.8 years. Later that year, Hey! Say! JUMP broke a record as the largest group to debut in Johnny's history, with ten members. Kitagawa, as of September, 2007, continued to be involved in the regular operation of Johnny & Associates.\n"}

She was the mother of Mary Anna Randolph Custis who was the wife of Robert E. Lee. Early in the 1820s, Molly Custis helped form a coalition of women who hoped to eradicate slavery.\n\nThe daughter of William Fitzhugh (1741–1809) a member of the Continental Congress, and Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh, Molly Custis was most likely born at Chatham Manor, in Stafford County, Virginia.\n\nOn July 7, 1804, Molly married George Washington Parke Custis, an orator, playwright, writer, and the grandson of Martha Custis Washington through her first marriage to Daniel Parke Custis. Molly Custis thus became George Washington's step-granddaughter-in-law. Molly's father William Fitzhugh and George Washington were long-time friends, with Washington mentioning in his diaries the hospitality of Molly's mother Ann Bolling Randolph Fitzhugh; a visit to William Fitzhugh turned out to be the last time Washington left Mt.

{"id": "42611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42611", "title": "McLibel case", "text": "McLibel case\n\nMcDonald's Corporation v Steel & Morris [1997] EWHC QB 366, known as \"the McLibel case\", was an English lawsuit for libel filed by McDonald's Corporation against environmental activists Helen Steel and David Morris (often referred to as \"The McLibel Two\") over a factsheet critical of the company. Each of two hearings in English courts found some of the leaflet's contested claims to be libellous and others to be true. The partial nature of the victory, the David-and-Goliath nature of the case, and the drawn-out litigation embarrassed McDonald's.\n\nThe original case lasted nearly ten years which, according to the BBC, made it the longest-running libel case in English history. McDonald's announced it did not plan to collect the £40,000 it was awarded by the courts. Following the decision, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in \"Steel & Morris v United Kingdom\" the pair had been denied a fair trial, in breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (right to a fair trial) and their conduct should have been protected by Article 10 of the Convention, which protects the right to freedom of expression. The court awarded a judgement of £57,000 against the UK government. McDonald's itself was not involved in, or a party to, this action, as applications to the ECHR are independent cases filed against the relevant state.\n\nIn 2013 it was revealed that one of the authors of the \"McLibel leaflet\", Bob Lambert, had been an undercover police officer who had infiltrated London Greenpeace. In 2016 it was revealed that a second undercover police officer, John Dines, had a sexual, romantic relationship with Helen Steel.\n\nFranny Armstrong and Ken Loach made a documentary film, \"McLibel\", about the case.\n\nLondon Greenpeace was a small environmental campaigning group which existed between 1972 and 2001. They were not affiliated with the larger Greenpeace International organisation, which they declined to join as they saw it being too \"centralised and mainstream for their tastes\".\n\nIn 1990, McDonald's brought libel proceedings against five London Greenpeace supporters, Paul Gravett, Andrew Clarke and Jonathan O'Farrell, as well as Steel and Morris, for distributing the sheet on the streets of London. This case followed past instances in which McDonald's threatened to sue more than fifty organisations for libel, including Channel 4 television and several major publications. In all such cases, the media outlets settled, and offered apologies for the alleged libel.\n\nUnder English defamation law, the defendant must show that each disparaging statement made is substantively true. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Three of the charged individuals (Gravett, Clarke and O'Farrell) chose to apologise as requested by McDonald's. Steel and Morris, however, chose to defend the case.\n\nThe two were denied Legal Aid, as was policy for libel cases, despite having very limited income. Thus, they had to represent themselves, though they received significant pro bono assistance. Steel and Morris called 180 witnesses, seeking to prove their assertions about food poisoning, unpaid overtime, misleading claims about how much McDonald's recycled, and \"corporate spies sent to infiltrate the ranks of London Greenpeace\". McDonald's spent several million pounds, while Steel and Morris spent £30,000; this disparity in funds meant Steel and Morris were not able to call all the witnesses they wanted, especially witnesses from South America who were intended to support their claims about McDonald's activities in that continent's rainforests.\n\nIn its libel allegation, McDonald's asserted all claims in the pamphlet as being false. They found it difficult to support this position despite the indirectness of some of the claims. The case eventually became a media circus. McDonald's executives, including Ray Cesca, entered the witness box, enabling cross-examination by the defendants.\n\nIn June 1995 McDonald's offered to settle the case (which \"was coming up to its [tenth] anniversary in court\") by donating a large sum of money to a charity chosen by the two. They further specified they would drop the case if Steel and Morris agreed to \"stop criticising McDonald's\". Steel and Morris secretly recorded the meeting, in which McDonald's said the pair could criticise McDonald's privately to friends but must cease talking to the media or distributing leaflets. Steel and Morris wrote a letter in response saying they would agree to the terms if McDonald's ceased advertising its products and instead only recommended the restaurant privately to friends.\n\nThe case was adjudicated by Hon. Mr Justice Rodger Bell. On 19 June 1997, Bell delivered a more than 1,000-page decision largely in favour of McDonald's, summarised by a 45-page paper read in court. Steel and Morris were found liable on several points, but the judge also found some of the points in the factsheet were true. McDonald's considered this a legal victory, though it was tempered by the judge's endorsement of some of the allegations in the sheet. Specifically, Bell ruled McDonald's endangered the health of their workers and customers by \"misleading advertising\", and they \"exploit children\", that they were \"culpably responsible\" in the infliction of unnecessary cruelty to animals, and they were \"antipathetic\" to unionisation and paid their workers low wages. Furthermore, although the decision awarded £60,000 to the company, McDonald's legal costs were much greater, and the defendants lacked the funds to pay it. Steel and Morris immediately appealed against the decision.\n\nIn 1998 a documentary film was made about the case, also titled \"McLibel\". This was updated in 2005 after the verdict of the final appeal.\n\nIn September 1998, the pair sued the Metropolitan Police for disclosing confidential information to investigators hired by McDonald's and received £10,000 and an apology for the alleged disclosure.\n\nAn appeal began on 12 January 1999 and lasted 23 court days, ending on 26 February. The case was heard in Court 1 of the Court of Appeal in the Royal Courts of Justice. The case was adjudicated by Lord Justices Pill and May and Mr Justice Keane. The defendants represented themselves in court, assisted by first year law student Kalvin P. Chapman (King's College London). McDonald's were represented by libel lawyer Richard Rampton QC, and a junior barrister, Timothy Atkinson, and Ms Pattie Brinley-Codd of Barlow, Lyde & Gilbert. Steel and Morris filed a 63-point appeal. They had requested a time extension, but were denied. The verdict for the appeal was handed down on 31 March, in Court 1 at the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\nThe judges ruled it was fair comment to say that McDonald's employees worldwide \"do badly in terms of pay and conditions\" and true \"if one eats enough McDonald's food, one's diet may well become high in fat, etc., with the very real risk of heart disease\". They further stated the last finding \"must have a serious effect on their trading reputation since it goes to the very business in which they are engaged. In our judgment, it must have a greater impact on the respondents' [McDonald's] reputation than any other of the charges that the trial judge had found to be true\".\n\nThe Court of Appeal also stated that it had \"considerable sympathy\" with the defendants' submissions that the leaflet meant \"that there is a respectable body of medical opinion which links a junk food diet with a risk of cancer and heart disease\", that 'this link was accepted both in literature published by McDonald's themselves and by one or more of McDonald's own experts and in medical publications of high repute', and that therefore 'that should have been an end of this part of the case'. They ruled against the defendants on the allegation that McDonald's food was a carcinogen.\n\nAs a result of their further findings against the Corporation, the three Lord Justices reduced Mr Justice Bell's award of £60,000 damages to McDonald's by £20,000. The court ruled against the argument by Steel and Morris that multinational corporations should no longer be able to sue for libel over public interest issues; they believed \"that may be seen as an argument of some substance\", but ultimately rejected it, on grounds that it was a matter for Parliament. Steel and Morris announced their intention to appeal over these and other points to the House of Lords, and then take the UK government to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.\n\nIn response to the verdict, David Pannick QC said in \"The Times\": \"The McLibel case has achieved what many lawyers thought impossible: to lower further the reputation of our law in the minds of all right thinking people.\"\n\nSteel and Morris appealed to the Law Lords, arguing that their right to legal aid had been unjustly denied. When the Law Lords refused to accept the case, the pair formally retained solicitor Mark Stephens and barrister (later Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)), Keir Starmer QC to file a case with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), contesting the UK government's policy that legal aid was not available in libel cases, and setting out a highly detailed case for what they believed to be the oppressive and unfair nature of UK libel laws in general, and in their case in particular. In September 2004, this action was heard by the ECHR. Lawyers for Steel and Morris argued that the lack of legal aid had breached the pair's right to freedom of expression and to a fair trial.\n\nOn 15 February 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the original case had breached Article 6 (right to a fair trial) and Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordered that the UK government pay Steel and Morris £57,000 in compensation. In their ruling, the ECHR criticised the way in which UK laws had failed to protect the public right to criticise corporations whose business practices affect people's lives and the environment (which violates Article 10); they also ruled that the trial was biased because of the defendants' comparative lack of resources and what they believed were complex and oppressive UK libel laws.\n\nIn particular the Court held:\n\nIn response to the European Court of Human Rights' decision, Steel and Morris issued the following press release:\n\nHaving largely beaten McDonald's... we have now exposed the notoriously oppressive and unfair UK laws. As a result of the... ruling today, the government may be forced to amend or scrap some of the existing UK laws. We hope that this will result in greater public scrutiny and criticism of powerful organisations whose practices have a detrimental effect on society and the environment. The McLibel campaign has already proved that determined and widespread grass roots protests and defiance can undermine those who try to silence their critics, and also render oppressive laws unworkable. The continually growing opposition to McDonald's and all it stands for is a vindication of all the efforts of those around the world who have been exposing and challenging the corporation's business practices. \n\nIn the course of the UK undercover policing relationships scandal it was revealed that one of the authors of the \"McLibel leaflet\" was Bob Lambert, an undercover police officer who infiltrated London Greenpeace; John Dines, another undercover officer, was also Helen Steel's partner for two years.\n\nThe Defamation Act 2013 brought some changes to libel cases, which were expected to make it harder for corporations to abuse libel law.\n\nThe McLibel case also raised awareness about how defamation proceedings can harm the reputation of companies which raise them, similar to the Streisand effect.\n\nThe \"McLibel\" film quoted McDonald's as offering little comment on the European Court decision other than to point out that it was the Government and not McDonald's who was the losing party and that \"times have changed and so has McDonald's\".\n\nOn a website aiming to state its view on issues raised about it, McDonald's stated that the case is in the past and the issues more so, and that both sides in it have moved on (although Morris and Steel did continue related litigation).\n\nA feature-length documentary film, \"McLibel\", was made about the case by Franny Armstrong and Ken Loach in 1997. An extended version was produced in 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

Moriwaki received no formal training in engineering while working for Yoshimura. Instead, he became self-taught, learning about mechanical engineering from books borrowed from his local high school. Moriwaki married Namiko Yoshimura, Pops’ eldest daughter, while he was working for the company. While working for the Yoshimura racing team, Moriwaki also successfully competed in auto racing, driving a Yoshimura-prepared Honda S800 sports car to a class victory at the 6 Hours of Fuji endurance race on July 26, 1970, and the GTS1 Class at the 1971 Japan Grand Prix.\n\nIn 1971, Yoshimura made the decision to move his company to the United States to take advantage of the burgeoning American motorcycle market. Moriwaki did not agree with Yoshimura and refused to leave his home in Japan. This created a rift between the two men however, within a year Yoshimura had returned to Japan and sought Moriwaki for help after he had been cheated out of all his money in a business transaction in America. Moriwaki loaned Yoshimura money to re-establish himself. Yoshimura would go on to establish one of the premier manufacturers of motorcycle high performance parts in the United States and became closely associated with the Suzuki racing program.\n\nMoriwaki remained in Japan and in 1973 he founded Moriwaki Engineering in Suzuka City, Japan. He became known for modifying engines and constructing frames for the Kawasaki Z1. His bikes were successfully raced in the Australian Superbike championships in the late 1970s by New Zealander Graeme Crosby. Crosby and co-rider Tony Hatton finished in third place at the prestigious Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race in 1978. Moriwaki's reputation continued to be enhanced when Crosby and Akitaka Tomie qualified a Moriwaki Kawasaki on pole position at the 1979 Suzuka 8 Hours, ahead of all the major factory racing teams. At the 1980 Suzuka 8 Hours race, the Moriwaki team of Dave Aldana and David Emde qualified in a respectable second place ahead of the official Kawasaki factory-backed team of Eddie Lawson and Gregg Hansford.\n\nAfter Crosby went on to race in the world championships, Moriwaki hired Australian rider Wayne Gardner in 1981. Also in 1981, Moriwaki developed the world’s first aluminum frame for large capacity motorcycles and entered them in competitions. Gardner and John Pace qualified their Moriwaki Kawasaki on pole position at the 1981 Suzuka 8 Hours, once again beating all the major factory racing teams. Gardner then rode the Moriwaki Kawasaki to an impressive fourth place finish at the 1981 Daytona Superbike race behind Yoshimura Suzuki riders Crosby, Wes Cooley and Honda's Freddie Spencer. Moriwaki and Gardner proceeded to compete in the British championship, winning their first race in England. Gardner entered the final race of the season with a chance to win the title but, an engine misfire relegated him to third place overall in the championship. Gardner's impressive results on the Moriwaki Kawasaki eventually earned him a contract with the Honda factory racing team and an eventual world championship in 1987.\n\nIn the 1980s, Moriwaki became closely associated with Honda Racing Corporation, the racing division for the Honda parent company. Moriwaki was the first outside firm allowed to use one of Honda's racing engines. From 2003 to 2005, Moriwaki competed in the premier MotoGP class with a Honda RC211V engine in a Moriwaki designed frame. The firm gained valuable knowledge from this experience and in 2010, a Moriwaki-framed machine run by Gresini Racing took the inaugural Moto2 title with rider Toni Elias. On the \"MD600\", Elias won 7 races with the bike and secured the championship with a fourth place at the Malaysian Grand Prix, held at Sepang.\n\nThe Moto2 formula is based on a universal engine and engine-ancillary equipment specification, with identical controlled engines supplied to teams via the organisers based on the Honda CBR600RR. Fuel, oil and tyres are also controlled. Teams are able to use any supplier of chassis, suspension and bodywork under strict regulations to enable no one team to dominate by technology or expenditure.\n\n"}

{"id": "1307994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1307994", "title": "Out-of-home advertising", "text": "Out-of-home advertising\n\nOut-of-home (OOH) advertising or outdoor advertising, also known as out-of-home media or outdoor media, is advertising that reaches the consumers while they are outside their homes.\n\nOut-of-home media advertising is focused on marketing to consumers when they are \"on the go\" in public places, in transit, waiting (such as in a medical office), and/or in specific commercial locations (such as in a retail venue). OOH advertising formats fall into six main categories: billboards, street, roads, highways, transit, and alternative.\n\nThe OOH advertising industry in the United States includes more than 2,100 operators in 50 states representing the major out of home format categories. These OOH media companies range from public, multinational media corporations to small, independent, family-owned businesses. Currently, the United Kingdom and France are Western Europe's first and second largest markets for OOH, respectively. Data from Outsmart (formerly the Outdoor Media Centre), the UK's out-of-home advertising trade association, shows that digital out-of-home (DOOH) grew at a 29.7% CAGR from 2009 to 2014.\n\nBillboard advertising is a traditional OOH advertising format, but there has been significant growth in digital OOH (digital billboards and place-based networks) in recent years; for example, about 4,900 digital billboard displays have been installed in China and the United States.\n\nTraditional roadside billboards remain the predominant form of OOH advertising in the US with 66 percent of total annual revenue. Today, billboard revenue is 73 percent local ads, 18 percent national ads, and 9 percent public service ads.\n\nStreet furniture is made up of formats such as bus shelters, newsracks, mall kiosks, and telephone booth advertising. This form of OOH advertising is mainly seen in urban centers. Additionally, this form of advertising provides benefits to communities, as building and maintaining the shelters people use while waiting for the bus.\n\nTransit advertising is typically advertising placed on anything which moves, such as buses, subway advertising, truckside, food trucks, and taxis, but also includes fixed static and electronic advertising at train and bus stations and platforms. Airport advertising, which helps businesses address an audience while traveling, is also included in this category. Municipalities often accept this form of advertising, as it provides revenue to city and port authorities.\n\nStreet furniture, transit, and alternative media formats comprise 34 percent of total outdoor revenue in the US. Some of these formats have a higher percentage of national ads than traditional billboards.\n\nDigital out-of-home (DOOH) refers to dynamic media distributed across place-based networks in venues including, but not limited to: cafes, bars, restaurants, health clubs, colleges, arenas, gas stations, convenience stores, barber shops, and public spaces. PQ Media defines DOOH by two major platforms, digital place-based networks (DPN) and digital billboards & signage (DBB); DOOH networks typically feature independently addressable screens, kiosks, jukeboxes and/or jumbotrons. DOOH media benefits location owners and advertisers alike in being able to engage customers and/or audiences and extend the reach and effectiveness of marketing messages. It is also referred to as digital signage.\n\nWithin the DOOH industry, advertisements may be purchased through programmatic platforms. Programmatic platforms ask marketers to specify desired audience characteristics and automatically locate the media vehicles to deliver that audience. Furthermore, these platforms may allow buyers (the demand side) to plan, execute and monitor campaigns across multiple media platforms (the supply side) using a familiar workflow.\n\nIn the U.S., the DOOH industry grew to $2.9 billion in 2015, representing 40.8% of the total OOH spending. Gas stations, restaurants, and bars are the preferred locations for ad placement. With digital TVs in gas stations, nearly 52 million customers are getting snippets of weather, sports highlights, celebrity gossip and commercials with their gas each month, according to Nielsen. The weekly reach is actually larger than most of the prime-time TV shows. The largest company in the space is Gas Station TV with 27.5 million monthly viewers at more than 1,100 stations across the U.S., according to Nielsen. In addition to the large number of viewers, the audience profile of TVs at gas stations is unique. All are drivers and 76 percent are adults from age 18-49 with a median age of 40 and median household income over $70,000. According to the Nielsen Intercept Studies, 89 percent of the consumers are engaged and watching TV at the gas station and 88 percent love watching every time they fuel because they have nothing else to do.\n\nThe reason that this category is growing so rapidly is because busy people are typically busy at home and with the introduction and acceptance of digital video recorders (DVRs), it has diluted the frequency with which traditional television commercials are viewed. Every day more TV viewers are skipping past commercials with their DVRs, making out-of-home advertising all the more appealing. A Nielsen media research study in 2009 showed that 91 percent of DVR owners skipped commercials. As a result, traditional TV advertisers are hungry for an effective substitute, and digital out-of-home ads appear to be one of the solutions. Digital out of home advertising seems to be a cost-effective way for promoting or marketing any brand or product. Usage of billboards and displays for brand promotion is a less expensive way of advertising than television, radio, newspapers and other mediums.\n\nDOOH also includes stand-alone screens, kiosks, and interactive media found in public places. The availability of inexpensive LCD screens with built-in media players has opened the door for companies to add interactive video messages in point of purchase (POP) displays. The displays allow consumers to get additional information at the moment of decision on a product or service. Growth in the DOOH industry has been increasing in 2009, with more POP manufacturers, advertisers, and content developers moving to digital. Technological improvements are holding down costs, and low-cost digital signage is making it easier to reach consumers on a larger scale. For example, beacons are small devices placed on out-of-home advertising structures that use Bluetooth technology to connect with mobile devices. \"Beacons allow you to communicate with the viewer. They also tell you frequency. With these technologies you could say, for example, with certainty that from 3-5 p.m. on a Monday this is how many men or women walked in front of your sign and also what percentage are new people, which are repeat people, etc.\" according to Mark Boidman, managing director at PJSC.\n\nIn 2015, DOOH have started to extend to in-transit advertising. Tablets are installed inside popular ride-sharing vehicles like Uber, Lyft and Grab. Digital ads are displayed inside the screens allowing brands to reach to high value passengers. This type of DOOH leverages technology to improvide ad distribution and better OOH audience targeting. GPS of tablets are used to enable location-based marketing. Brands can specify geo-fences to determine where their ads will be shown to the passengers.\n\nPrinted out of home refers to static media distributed across physical spaces. These are:\n\nAerial advertising – Aerial advertising includes towing banners via a fixed-wing aircraft as well as airships like blimps and other air-born inflatables overhead of beaches, events and gridlock traffic.\n\nBillboard bicycle is a new type of mobile advertising in which a bike tows a billboard with an advertising message. This method is a cost-efficient, targeted, and environmentally friendly form of advertising. \n\nBrochure Distribution – Information displays in public gathering spaces such as transportation centers, lodging facilities, visitor centers, attractions, and retail environments are targeted ways to distribute highly effective messaging to a targeted audience. This method is slightly different than traditional OOH as the consumer self-selects the messaging material and can take that message with them.\n\nBillboard – Billboards (or Bulletins) are usually located in highly visible, heavy traffic areas such as expressways, primary arterials, and major intersections. In the U.S. bulletins are usually illuminated. The ad artwork, commonly digitally printed on large vinyl coated fabric membranes, is often \"rotated\" by the outdoor plant operator amongst several locations in a metropolitan area to achieve the desired reach of the population as defined in the sales contract. With extended periods of high visibility, billboard advertisements provide advertisers with significant impact on commuters. This is the largest standard out of home advertising format, usually measuring at 14ftx48ft in overall size.\n\nBus advertising – Firmly establish brand awareness and generate quick recall with high-profile exposure near point of purchase locations.\n\nCommuter rail display – Reaches a captive audience of upscale suburban commuters. Additionally, reaches lunch-time patrons, shoppers and business professionals.\n\nComPark advertising – ComPark is a device used for car park advertising; which is placed onto the parallel lines of a bay and is able to gain instant exposure from motorists that have just parked their vehicle. The ComPark also serves as a guide to assist motorist in adhering to the parking bay size.\n\nInflatable billboard – similar to regular 2D billboard but imposed on 3D object. Best used to market physical products rather than services. A cost-effective approach that is able to achieve high brand awareness and increase product purchases.\n\nLamppost banner advertising – Lamp columns are sited everywhere, allowing advertisers and events to use banners to target precise geographical locations and create massive promotional awareness.\n\nMobile billboard – Mobile billboards offer a great degree of flexibility to advertisers. These advertisements can target specific routes, venue or events, or can be used to achieve market saturation. A special version is the inflatable billboard which can stand free nearly everywhere. This product can also be used for outdoor movie nights. \n\nPoster – Target local audiences with these billboards, which are highly visible to vehicular traffic and are ideal for the introduction of new products/services. Marketers use posters to achieve advertising objectives and increase brand awareness by placing multiple units in strategic locations while lowering the cost per thousand impressions. This is a standardized poster format, typically measuring 12'3\" x 24'6\"; formally known as a 30-Sheet Poster.\n\nPremier panel – Premiere panels combine the frequency and reach of a poster campaign with the creative impact of a bulletin.\n\nPremier square – Bright top and bottom illumination on a premiere panel provide extra impact after dark.\n\nStreet advertising – The use of pavements and street furniture to create media space for brands to get their message onto the street in a cost-effective approach.\n\nTaxi advertising – Taxi advertising allows advertisers to highlight their products, whether brand awareness, or a targeted message, directly to areas where people work, shop, and play.\n\nWallscape – Wallscapes are attached to buildings and are able to accommodate a wide variety of unusual shapes and sizes. These billboard advertisements are visible from a distance and provide tremendous impact in major metro areas.\n\nAircraft Advertising – Aircraft advertising includes product or service branding inside and outside the aircraft. This includes wrapping the aircraft with printed SAVs, baggage tag branding, boarding pass branding, tray table branding and more.\n\nOther types of non-digital OOH advertising include airport displays; transit and bus-shelter displays; headrest displays; double-sided panels; junior posters; and mall displays.\n\nDifferent jurisdictions regulate outdoor advertising to different degrees.\n\n\nMedia fragmentation, competition from online media, as well as the need for greater efficiencies in media buying prompted companies to offer billboard inventory aggregation services\nInteractive services are becoming increasingly more common with the move to digital outdoor advertising, such as allowing the public to connect, share and interact through their mobile devices in particular through WiFi connections.\n"}

She died two days after giving birth to a son, Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince of San Donato, at Hietzing in the suburbs of Vienna on 6 August 1868. Her loss had a lasting effect on Pavel, who remained inconsolable for a long time, spending a long while in the room in the Villa San Donato where his wife's dresses were kept to try to recover her presence.\n\nIn Saint Petersburg on 2 June 1871 he remarried to Princess Elena Petrovna Trubetskaya (Saint Petersburg, 25 September 1853 - Odessa, 28 July 1917), with whom he had six children:\n\nThey decided San Donato was too full of memories of his first wife and so moved to Villa Pratolino (now known as Villa Demidoff). They ended up selling San Donato, and it was ceded on 5 November 1881 to Gaston Mestayer (a French business magnate), with the gardens sold separately to Nemesio Papucci and Rosselli Del Turco. A large part of the enormous Demidov collection of artworks housed in 14 rooms at San Donato were thus dispersed in several sales and memorable public auctions, even the works gathered in the \"musée napoléonien\" created on Elba by his uncle Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato and the souvenirs that had (mostly) been ceded to Anatole by his father-in-law Jérôme Bonaparte.\n\nOwning hundreds of factories in Russia, millions of square kilometres of land and palaces in Russia, France and Italy, Pavel was considered as one of the richest men in Europe. He developed the family fortunes and inherited Anatole's title of Prince of San Donato after the latter's death without legitimate issue in 1870 (with the title recognised by king Victor Emmanuel II of Italy two years later). He served with the Red Cross rather than the Russian military forces during the Russo-Turkish War and in 1883 he published the pro-Jewish \"The Jewish Question in Russia\".\n\n"}
{"id": "216181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216181", "title": "Pete du Pont", "text": "Pete du Pont\n\nPierre Samuel \"Pete\" du Pont IV (born January 22, 1935) is an American lawyer and politician from Rockland, in New Castle County, Delaware, near Wilmington. He was the United States Representative for Delaware from 1971 to 1977 and subsequently served as the 68th Governor of Delaware from 1977 to 1985. He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nA member of the Du Pont family, du Pont was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of Pierre S. du Pont III and Jane Holcomb du Pont, and great nephew of Pierre S. du Pont, the developer of Longwood Gardens. After an education at the Phillips Exeter Academy, Princeton University, and Harvard Law School, he served in the U.S. Naval Reserve (Seabees) from 1957 until 1960. He is married to Elise Ravenel Wood and has four children, Elise, Pierre S. du Pont V, Benjamin Franklin du Pont, and Eleuthère I. du Pont.\n\nFrom 1963 until 1970 du Pont was employed by E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. In 1968 he was elected to the 1969–70 session of the Delaware House of Representatives. He seriously considered a bid for a United States Senate seat in 1972 (eventually won by Democrat Joseph R. Biden, Jr.), but realized he faced a primary election against former U.S. Representative Harry G. Haskell, Jr. He bowed to the desire of Republican leaders, including President Richard Nixon, to have a reluctant incumbent U.S. Senator J. Caleb Boggs seek a third term.\n\nIn 1970 du Pont was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, defeating Democrat John D. Daniello, a New Castle County Councilman and labor leader. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives two more times, defeating Democrats Norma Handloff in 1972 and University of Delaware professor James R. Soles in 1974. In Congress, du Pont supported an attempt to limit presidential authority through the War Powers Act of 1973, but was one of the last to remain loyal to U.S. President Richard M. Nixon during the impeachment process.\n\nDu Pont did not seek another term in the U.S. House of Representatives, having been elected Governor of Delaware in 1976, defeating incumbent Democratic Governor Sherman W. Tribbitt. He was elected to a second term as governor in 1980, defeating Democratic State House leader William J. Gordy, and served two terms from January 18, 1977 until January 15, 1985. \n\nDu Pont's two terms as governor were the major divide in the modern history of the state. Following a desperate initial confrontation with the Democratic Delaware General Assembly over the budget, both du Pont and the Delaware General Assembly developed the consensus approach to decision making that remains characteristic of Delaware politics. As a result of this cooperation, du Pont signed into law two income tax reduction measures and a constitutional amendment that restrained future tax increases and limited government spending. The \"Wilmington News Journal\" praised these policies, saying that du Pont \"revived [the] business climate and set the stage for [Delaware's] prosperity.\" In 1979, he founded the nonprofit \"Jobs for Delaware Graduates,\" an employment counseling and job placement program for high school seniors not bound for college. This program was the model for other programs currently functioning in many states and foreign countries.\n\nIn 1981, Du Pont helped establish the credit card industry in Delaware, in a race against South Dakota, which the year before had abolished its usury law limiting the interest rates that banks can charge consumers for credit. At the time, du Pont's cousin Nathan Hayward III advocated that tiny Delaware aspire to become the \"financial Luxembourg of America\" - a tax haven for corporations, yacht owners and credit card companies permitted to charge unlimited interest. Former Du Pont Chairman Irving Shapiro, a lobbyist for Citigroup, helped Gov. du Pont pass the Financial Center Development Act in 1981 with the cooperation of the leadership of both parties and others in state and local government. Intended to attract two New York state banks that would hire at least 1,000 employees, the law eventually drew more than thirty banks to Delaware, creating 43,000 new finance related jobs and leading the state away from its previous dependence on the chemical industry in general and the Du Pont Company in particular.\n\nWith his term as governor forced by law to end in 1985, du Pont, as the dominant Delaware politician, was widely expected by many to challenge the incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Biden. But du Pont had little interest in legislative politics and declined to run, preparing instead for a long shot bid for the Republican U.S. presidential nomination in the 1988 election. (His wife, Elise, ran for the U.S. Congressional seat that he had previously held in 1984, but lost to incumbent Democrat Tom Carper.) He declared his intent on September 16, 1986, before anyone else. Biden also sought his party's nomination.\n\nRunning in the 1988 Republican presidential primaries, du Pont presented an unconventional program. As described by Celia Cohen in her book, \"Only in Delaware,\" du Pont, \"wanted to reform Social Security by offering recipients private savings options in exchange for a corresponding reduction in government benefits. He proposed phasing out government subsidies for farmers. He said he would wean welfare clients off their benefits and get them into the workforce, even if government had to provide entry level jobs to get them started. He suggested students be subjected to mandatory, random drug tests with those who flunked losing their drivers licenses.\" After finishing next to last in the New Hampshire primary, du Pont left the race.\n\nIn 1984, du Pont served as chairman of the Education Commission of the States, a national organization of educators dedicated to improving all facets of American education. He has also served as chairman of the Hudson Institute from 1985 until 1987 and the National Review Institute from 1994 until 1997.\n\n, du Pont is the chairman of the board for the National Center for Policy Analysis, a think tank based in Dallas, Texas; he is a director with the Wilmington, Delaware law firm of Richards, Layton, and Finger, and until May 2014, he wrote the monthly \"Outside the Box\" column for the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n"}

He has substantially shaped the Swiss financial services sector and the international hedge fund industry.\n\nRainer-Marc Frey was born on January 10, 1963 in the Swiss canton of Basel-Landschaft. Following his Matura graduation in economics at the Gymnasium of Liestal, he studied economics at the renowned University of St. Gallen. He graduated summa cum laude with a degree in economics (lic. oec. HSG) in 1986.\n\nAfter his studies, he gained his first professional experiences at the American investment banks Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers and quickly rose in the ranks. At Salomon Brothers, he initiated the opening of new trading departments in Zürich and Frankfurt. Despite excellent career prospects, he left the firm in 1992 and founded his own hedge fund – the RMF Investment Group - along with two partners in Zug.\n\nThe investment thesis of hedge funds, i.e. achieving above average returns compared to the reference market and reducing risk through hedging strategies, was widely unknown in Switzerland at the time and was met by scepticism among investors. RMF achieved ground-breaking results. At the beginning, banks and insurance companies in Switzerland did not see the potential in this type of fund, which aimed to also make gains in sideways or negative trending markets. As such, RMF started trading on Japanese warrants and convertible bonds. It was one of the first active hedge fund groups in Europe. RMF’s investment thesis proved successful, despite difficult periods such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Following these dry spell periods, institutional investors started accepting these concepts.\n\nA successful collaboration with LGT Group and Swiss Life (then Schweizerische Lebensversicherungs- und Rentenanstalt) started in 1996 with the launch of Castle Alternative Invest, a hedge fund investment company. Swiss Life were expanding their alternative investment activities rapidly and built a stake of 23.5% of RMF valued at CHF 44 million in 1998, respectively 2000. Further cooperations with insurance companies followed in subsequent years. As the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, market neutral strategies of hedge funds became increasingly popular. The same year, Credit Suisse invested close to CHF 4 billion in hedge fund strategies through RMF. By 2002, most large Swiss insurers were among RMF’s key clients.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, RMF Investment Group developed into one of the leading alternative asset managers in Europe. Assets under management reached USD 8.5 billion in 2002. The same year, Man Group plc made a takeover offer of approximately CHF 1.35 billion for RMF. The RMF shareholders accepted this offer and it merged with the Man Group. As part of the deal, RMF’s 12-member management team committed itself to remain on board at the merged company for 3 years. Through this acquisition, the Man Group became the world’s largest provider of hedge fund investments.\n\nThe sale of his stake in RMF resulted in proceeds of approximately CHF 500 million for Frey. However, Frey and his partners did not rest on their laurels after the sale. In 2004 already, they founded their next investment firm, which would specialize in alternative investments, Horizon 21 AG, headquartered in Pfäffikon, Schwyz.\n\nIn September 2005, Swiss Re became a strategic partner to Horizon21 and acquired a 20% stake in the Horizon21 Alternative Investments business unit. A year later, the partnership between the two firms grew stronger, as they joined efforts in the private equity fund of funds business. Horizon21 took over the private equity activities of Swiss Re, which in turn bought 30% of the Horizon21 Private Equity Holding.\n\nSince the inception of Horizon21, the management of the founders’ and partners’ wealth has been a focal point of its activities. Following a strategic re-orientation in 2010, Horizon21 positioned itself as a private investment office and it tailors its activities around the founders’ and partners’ investment needs.\n\nSince the sale of RMF, Frey has made himself a name as an industrial investor through stakes in several companies. As private investor and majority shareholder, he was able to share his entrepreneurial experiences to the benefit of the companies in which he invested.\n\nIn October 2008, Frey was named onto the Board of Directors of the then crisis-ridden UBS. The nomination of Frey was intended to bring back more knowledge of the financial industry into the board of directors. Frey was considered as an independent spirit with a strong voice. He was a member of the Risk Committee, as well as the Audit Committee and was later also appointed to the Human Resources and Compensation Committee. In April 2014, he decided not to present himself for reelection to the board of directors in order to pursue other professional engagements.\n\nFrey is a member of the Board of Directors of DKSH since 2008 and he serves on the Audit and Strategy Committees. DKSH is an internationally active market expansion services group, which is deeply rooted in communities across Asia Pacific and headquartered in Zürich. Frey holds a 3.9% equity stake in DKSH.\n\nSince 2010, he also holds a stake of currently 8.67% in the Swiss pharmaceuticals company Siegfried Holding AG, based in Zofingen.\n\nFrey is main shareholder and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Lonrho Holdings Ltd since 2013. The company is a diversified conglomerate, which is active in Sub-Saharan Africa. He submitted a takeover bid to the former shareholders in 2013 alongside Swiss entrepreneur Thomas Schmidheiny. The takeover was finalized on July 19, 2013 and taken private for a value of CHF 270 million.\n\nFrey is the Vice-President of the Board of the Frey Charitable Foundation (FCF), founded in 2004. Guided by an entrepreneurial mindset, which has been key to Rainer-Marc Frey’s own success, FCF aims to empower the underprivileged to successfully take control of their own lives. While active in different countries around the world in the first decade of their activities, FCF focuses particularly on Africa and Switzerland. In Africa, FCF focuses on supporting outstanding social entrepreneurs in a variety of thematic areas.\n\nIn his free time, Frey is a pilot.\n\n"}

The notion of the regulatory state is increasingly more attractive for theoreticians of the state with the growth in the use and application of rule making, monitoring and enforcement strategies and with the parallel growth of civil regulation and business regulation.

The bank serves over 16 million clients and has 80,000 employees worldwide. The bank was founded in 1864 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, while its corporate headquarters are located in Montreal, Quebec and Toronto, Ontario. RBC's Institution Number (or bank number) is 003. In November 2017, RBC was added to the Financial Stability Board's list of global systemically important banks.\n\nIn Canada, the bank's personal and commercial banking operations are branded as \"RBC Royal Bank\" in English and \"RBC Banque Royale\" in French and serves approximately ten million clients through its network of 1,209 branches. \"RBC Bank\" is the U.S. banking subsidiary which formerly operated 439 branches across six states in the Southeastern United States, but now only offers cross-border banking services to Canadian travellers and expats. RBC also has 127 branches across seventeen countries in the Caribbean, which serve more than 16 million clients. RBC Capital Markets is RBC's worldwide investment and corporate banking subsidiary, while the investment brokerage firm is known as RBC Dominion Securities. Investment banking services are also provided through RBC Bank and the focus is on middle market clients.\n\nIn 2011, RBC was the largest Canadian company by revenue and market capitalization. and was ranked at No. 50 in the 2013 Forbes Global 2000 listing. The company has operations in Canada, and 40 other countries and had US$673.2 billion of assets under management in 2014.\n\nIn 1864, the Merchants Bank of Halifax was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a commercial bank that financed the fishing and timber industries and the European and Caribbean import/export businesses. By 1869 the Merchants' Bank was officially incorporated and received its federal charter in the same year.\n\nDuring the 1870s and 1880s, the bank expanded into the other Maritime Provinces. When both the Newfoundland Commercial Bank and Union Bank of Newfoundland collapsed on 10 December 1894, the Merchants Bank expanded to Newfoundland on 31 January 1895.\n\nAs the bank grew, executives changed its name to reflect its growth and western expansion. In 1901, the Merchants Bank of Halifax changed its name to the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). The centre of the Canadian financial industry had moved from Halifax to Montreal, so the Merchants Bank relocated its head office there. In 1910, RBC merged with the Union Bank of Halifax. In the same year it built a bank branch in Winnipeg, Manitoba—designed by Carrère and Hastings, in beaux-arts classicism proclaiming the financial dominance of Winnipeg in the prairies. To improve its position in Ontario, RBC merged with Traders Bank of Canada in 1912 and in 1917 RBC merged with Quebec Bank, which was founded in 1818 and chartered in 1822 in Quebec City.\n\nRBC's presence in Manitoba and Saskatchewan was strengthened through a 1918 merger with Northern Crown Bank, which was the result of the merger in 1908 between Northern Bank (established in 1905 in Winnipeg) and Crown Bank of Canada (1904), based in Ontario. RBC's presence in the Prairie Provinces grew again with the 1925 merger with the Union Bank of Canada, which had begun in Quebec City in 1865 as the Union Bank of Lower Canada, but changed its name in 1886. The Union Bank of Canada had moved its headquarters to Winnipeg in 1912, and had built a strong presence in the Prairies and opened the first bank in the Northwest Territories at Fort Smith in 1921.\n\nIn 1935, RBC merged with Crown Savings and Loan Co. merged with Industrial Mortgage & Trust Co.\n\nRBC installed its first computer in 1961, the first in Canadian banking. In the 1960s, RBC Insurance was created. In 1968, it merged with Ontario Loan and Debenture Company (formerly Ontario Savings and Investment Society). In 1993, RBC merged with Royal Trust. In 1998, RBC acquired Security First Network Bank in Atlanta—the first pure Internet bank. In 2000, RBC merged merchant credit/debit card acquiring business with BMO Bank of Montreal's to form Moneris Solutions. In 2013, RBC completed the acquisition of the Canadian subsidiary of Ally Financial.\n\nRBC Insurance is the largest Canadian bank-owned insurance organization, with services to over five million people. It provides life, health, travel, home and auto and reinsurance products as well as creditor and business insurance services.\n\n\nThe bank's symbol is a golden lion clutching a globe, on a blue background. An older version depicted a crown above the globe and the lion faced to the left. The change coincided with an expansion in United States markets. Over the years, the lion's mane has also become less detailed and more stylized, and the tongue was shortened.\n\nThe title of Royal Bank's top executive has changed several times. Initially it was styled as \"President\". Later, it became \"chief executive officer\" and one often carried additional responsibilities as \"chairman of the board\", while the second-in-command was the \"President\". Allan R. Taylor was chairman and CEO from 1986 to 1994, and he was succeeded by John Cleghorn in that capacity from 1994 to 2001. Dave McKay is currently the \"President and chief executive officer\".\n\n\n\n\nRBC's official legal corporate headquarters still remains at Place Ville-Marie in Montreal. However, Royal Bank Plaza in Toronto is its de facto corporate headquarters; a lot of its management operations are based there.\n\nIn 2007, RBC was recognized as the Top Most 100 powerful brands in the world. Was recognized as the \"most respected corporation\" in Canada In October 2008, RBC was named one of \"Canada's Top 100 Employers\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in \"Maclean's\" newsmagazine. Later that month, RBC was also named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers, which was announced by the Toronto Star newspaper. According to a global Newsweek ranking, which measures how effectively companies manage environmental risks and opportunities relative to their industry peers, Royal Bank of Canada is the most environmentally friendly company in the world.\n\nLike many of its competitors, RBC is a key sponsor of many events, community programs, and charities. One percent of RBC's average annual net income before taxes is set aside for charitable partnerships via the arms-length RBC Foundation.\n\nRBC is a major sponsor of numerous cultural events, including the Toronto International Film Festival. It also sponsors the RBC Taylor Prize, a literary award for non-fiction writing in Canada, and hosts a yearly Canadian Women Entrepreneur Award. In July 2013, the RBC Foundation partnered with the University of Toronto to revive the Siminovitch Prize in Theatre, given to recognize achievement in Canadian theatre.\n\nRBC is one of Canada's largest sponsors of amateur sports and is the longest-running Canadian sponsor of the Olympic Games. It employ dozens of top-tier amateur athletes as part-time spokespeople through the RBC Olympians program. RBC is also a major sponsor of Hockey Canada and owns the naming rights to the Canadian national junior 'A' ice hockey championship, the Royal Bank Cup. In addition, it supports Canadian hockey at the grassroots level through the RBC Play Hockey program.\n\nRBC owns naming rights to the RBC Centre, RBC Convention Centre Winnipeg, RBC Canadian Open, and RBC Heritage (formerly the Heritage Classic). From 2002 to 2012, RBC previously held the naming rights to what is now the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1998, the Royal Bank of Canada proposed to merge with the Bank of Montreal, at the same time as the Toronto-Dominion Bank proposed to merge with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Both mergers were examined by the Competition Bureau of Canada, and ultimately rejected by Paul Martin, at the time the Finance Minister of Canada, and future Prime Minister.\n\nOn January 15, 2007, CBC Radio reported RBC is \"refusing\" people of certain nationalities to open U.S. dollar accounts with the bank. Canadian citizens with dual citizenship in Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea or Sudan (mostly countries with U.S. sanctions) are affected. The U.S. Treasury Department restricts certain foreign nationals from using the U.S. dollar payment system to limit terrorism and money laundering after the September 11, 2001, attacks. RBC replied that compliance with such laws does not represent an endorsement by the bank and on January 17, clarified its position on the application of the U.S. laws, specifying that \"with some exceptions\" it does open accounts for dual citizens of the sanctioned countries. There have also been reports that the bank has closed the accounts of some Iranian-Canadian citizens.\n\nEnvironmental groups have criticized RBC's financing of oil sands bitumen extraction and expansion, cumulatively issuing \"more than $2.3 billion in loans and financing more than $6.9 billion in [corporate] debt between 2003 and 2007 for 13 companies including: EnCana, Husky Energy, OPTI Canada, Delphi Energy, Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Northwest Upgrading, Suncor, Total, Connacher Oil and Gas, InterPipeline and Enbridge.\" Some environmental groups believe oil sands extraction has a detrimental effect on the northern Alberta environment.\n\nAn RBC branch in The Glebe neighbourhood of Ottawa was firebombed in May 2010. The party responsible later identified themselves on Indymedia and threatened to make their presence at the upcoming 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, as RBC was one of its key sponsors, as well as at the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit.\n\nIn April 2013, the CBC reported that the Royal Bank of Canada was indirectly hiring temporary foreign workers to replace 45 Canadian Information Technology workers.\n\nThe CBC reported on May 7, 2013, that during question period the NDP leveled accusations against the government and then Prime Minister Stephen Harper, to which he responded that the government has been working on problems with the Temporary Foreign Worker Program for more than a year.\n\nRBC invested in SCO during the series of court cases seeking to collect royalties from the users of Linux.\n\nRBC is a member of the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) and is a registered member with the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), a federal agency insuring deposits at all of Canada's chartered banks.\n\nIt is also a member of:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3329115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3329115", "title": "She Hate Me", "text": "She Hate Me\n\nShe Hate Me is a 2004 independent comedy-drama film directed by Spike Lee and starring Anthony Mackie, Kerry Washington, Ellen Barkin, Monica Bellucci, Brian Dennehy, Woody Harrelson, Bai Ling and John Turturro.\n\nThe film garnered controversy, and, as with many of Lee's films, touches on comedy, drama, and politics. Unlike many prior works, Spike Lee does not have an acting credit in this film.\n\nThe film was shot mostly on location in New York City, including each of the city's five boroughs. It was nominated for various awards but failed to win. \"She Hate Me\" was released in July 2004 and grossed almost half a million dollars at the box office in limited release, with overall revenues of around $1.5 million. The shooting budget was estimated at $8 million.\n\nJohn Henry \"Jack\" Armstrong (Anthony Mackie) is a financially successful and upwardly mobile executive at a biotechnology firm who, following the suicide of a colleague, Dr. Herman Schiller, is falsely accused of securities fraud by his superior, Leland Powell (Woody Harrelson). Armstrong's assets are frozen, and he finds himself unable to maintain his quality of life.\n\nIn order to make ends meet, he becomes a sperm donor, initially by acquiescing to the desires of Fatima Goodrich (Kerry Washington), his ex-fiancée who came out as a lesbian and now wants a child. Although there is still unresolved bitterness and tension between them over Armstrong and Goodrich's prior relationship (as before coming out, Armstrong discovered her cheating on him with another women, who she was having sex with), she and her girlfriend, Alex Guerrero (Dania Ramirez), offer him a substantial sum of money to impregnate them both. This leads to Goodrich goading Armstrong into establishing a business in which groups of lesbians come over to his house and pay him $10,000 each to have sex with them in order to become pregnant. This business becomes a success, along with many of the women enjoying the intercourse with him.\n\nOne of the women whom Armstrong impregnates is the daughter of a mafia boss, Don Angelo Bonasera (played by John Turturro). Armstrong's employers learn of his impregnation business, and they use it in their campaign to sully his image in order to deflect attention from their own criminal business activities. Conflict is also depicted in the turbulent relationship between Armstrong's mother and his dependent diabetic father (Jim Brown).\n\nAt the film's climax, Armstrong's situation is portrayed as a \"cause célèbre\", with protests being held in support of or against him, and the news media interviewing people on the street with respect to his sexual activities. Armstrong is called before a committee of the United States Senate investigating his alleged securities fraud, where both his services to lesbians and his relationship to the \"Bonasera crime family\" are raised.\n\nArmstrong's situation is compared, both by cutaway scenes and by direct reference in dialogue, to the plight of Frank Wills, the security guard who discovered the break-in that led to the Watergate scandal, which brought down President Nixon. He eventually wins the case and is seen with nineteen of the children he helped his lesbian acquaintances make at the end.\n\nBy the end of the film, Armstrong and Goodrich have come to terms with their lingering feelings for one another, and with the mutual attraction they share for Guerrero. They then begin a three-way polyamorous relationship, and Armstrong apparently maintains a friendship with all of the eighteen women who became pregnant by him.\n\n\"She Hate Me\" received a sharply negative reaction from film critics, with a score of just 19% on the site Rotten Tomatoes. \"It's not only unfathomable and borderline offensive, it's never-ending, leaving its bewildered and battered audience in the dark for well over two hours,\" wrote \"Detroit Free Press\" critic Terry Lawson. Roger Ebert, who gave the film three stars out of four, said the film \"will get some terrible reviews. Scorched earth reviews. Its logic, style, presumption and sexual politics will be ridiculed. The Tomatometer will be down around 20\"—a spot-on prediction, as it turned out. \"Many of the things you read in those reviews may be true from a conventional point of view. Most of the critics will be on safe ground. I will seem to be wrong. Seeming to be wrong about this movie is one of the most interesting things I've done recently. I've learned from it.\"\n\nThe film grossed a total of $1,522,377 in the box office.\n\nSpike Lee based the title of the film on XFL football player Rod Smart, who gained some notoriety by nicknaming himself \"He Hate Me\". The main character in the film references Smart when explaining why he has decided to nickname his ex-fiancée \"She Hate Me\". The title words of this film originally were spoken by Boris Karloff's Monster in response to the revulsion of Elsa Lanchester seeing him for the first time in the climax of \"Bride of Frankenstein\". John \"Jack\" Henry's name alludes to the legend of John Henry, who worked hard against his opponent (the steel driving machine) and won, but soon afterward died of heart failure.\n\nActor Isiah Whitlock Jr. appears in the film as Agent Amos Flood, with the same last name of a role he played in the Spike Lee film \"25th Hour\", though there are no obvious parallels between the two films. This was the last film featuring Ossie Davis, as he died in February 2005. German actor David Bennent re-appeared after a long film career absence, and portrays the German scientist who 'jumps' to his end. Raul Midon sang the theme song for the movie, \"Adam 'N' Eve 'N' Eve\". In the film, Armstrong's brother disapproves of his impregnating lesbians and also uses the phrase \"Adam 'N' Eve 'N' Eve.\n\nSome real human births are seen up-close in the film. A live human birth is also portrayed in another Spike Lee film, \"Mo' Better Blues\".\n\n"}

It also airs on CNBC Asia between 2.00 p.m.-5.00 p.m. Hong Kong / Singapore time (1.00 p.m.-4.00 p.m. with DST), and in the United States on CNBC World at the respective time, 1:00 a.m. - 4:00 a.m., ET. The programme is co-anchored by Geoff Cutmore, Steve Sedgwick and Karen Tso. Prior to June 2003, the programme ran for only two hours, between 7.00 to 9.00 UK time but later gained an hour from \"Today's Business\".\n\n\"Squawk Box Europe\" was in existence prior to CNBC Europe's merger with European Business News. Like the current version, the original version took viewers to the opening of the European markets. This version was hosted by Nigel Roberts. After the merger, it was replaced by \"Europe Today\" for more than a year before being revived in 1998. The programme was originally known by the fuller title of \"CNBC Europe Squawk Box\" until it was relaunched in September 2004 as part of a wider relaunch of all of CNBC Europe's programming. From this point it used titles and graphics inspired by (but unlike the previously set, not directly derived from) CNBC US' look at the time and the show's theme music was an edited version of its US' counterpart's theme music used between 2003-2005.\n\nOn 1 December 2008, \"Squawk Box Europe\" was relaunched with a new look, logo, and music. The programme became more similar to the US version but the new look was designed specially for \"Squawk Box Europe\". Louisa Bojesen and Steve Sedgwick, previously reporters, were promoted to full co-presenters of the programme at this point, and the \"News Update\" segments, which had been axed by CNBC Europe some years previously, returned. \n\nOn 1 March 2010, \"Squawk Box Europe\", along with the rest of CNBC Europe's programmes, realigned its graphics (and title) with those of CNBC U.S. Bojesen left the programme in April 2010 to join \"European Closing Bell\", and was replaced by Anna Edwards, but she left the network at the end of 2011 and was subsequently replaced by Karen Tso (formerly of CNBC Asia).\n\nOn 9 May 2011, the programme's format received a major re-working, with the second hour of the programme being dubbed \"Squawk Pre-Trade\" and the third hour as \"Squawk Real-Time\". The programme's on air title was changed to simply \"Squawk Box\", in line with the US and Asian equivalents.\n\nOn 9 March 2015, \"Squawk Box Europe\" launched new titles and new theme music based on the US version. On 27 April 2015, the Asia version began using the US theme music.\n\nOn 8 February 2016, both the Asian and European versions started using the remastered \"Squawk Box\" logo that has been used by their US counterpart since 4 January 2016.\n\nSince the May 2011 reformatting, the focus has been on the pan-European picture and the STOXX Europe 600 rather than on the national indices. It covers the opening of the European markets at 8:00 a.m. WET where Tso stands in front of the video wall. \n\nA guest host also appears on the programme each day (during the second and third hour, like its US and Asian counterparts). Another important element of the show is its interviews with other analysts and CEOs of major companies. Viewers are welcomed to email their thoughts and questions to the show's guests.\n\nMaria Bartiromo (who was part of the original US \"Squawk Box\" team) served as a guest co-anchor on the show when in London to co-host the annual European Business Leaders Awards until she left CNBC altogether in November 2013.\n\nThe host of \"Squawk Box Europe\", Geoff Cutmore, also has a blog on CNBC.com, called \"Morning Thoughts\".\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Ort Singalovski School in Computers and Electronics specialty class. \nTsahi Merkur's breakthrough took place in the framework of his business activities on the Internet, and as a global pioneer in the field of an innovative business model entrepreneur. He was the first person in the world to incorporate commercial advertisements on the Internet, and did so even before Google and Facebook, which are leaders in the world today in the field of Internet advertising services .\n\nMerkur is the owner of a large international group of companies, engaged in many fields of activity, including hi-tech, internet, real estate, retail, hotel, energy, advertising, bio-acoustics and electric transportation. \nin recent years, he has been promoting voluntary activity for people in need and ill children in Israel and around the world, and has established the National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need .\nIn August 2018, Tsahi Merkur Enters into Partnership with the British Energy Giant Centrica .\n\nIn 1999, Merkur founded the parking company, the “Parking Giant”, and later \"Success parking\", \"Reit Parking\" as well as other parking companies . \nIn 2005, Success Parking became the largest car park company in Israel and it also began to operate public parking lots. In 2005, the company won a tender for the operation of the five largest parking lots in Tel Aviv of \"Ahuzot HaHof\", for the duration of two years . As of 2013, the number of parking lots and facilities owned and operated by \" Success Parking\" stands at approximately one hundred . \nIn 2008, Merkur acquired from Yitzhak Tshuva, through Success Parking, a portfolio of nine parking facilities in the cities of Tel Aviv, Netanya, Petah Tikva and Jerusalem with 2,000 parking spaces for about 40 million NIS. Success Parking revenue for 2009 was more than $200 million. In 2010, Merkur attempted to acquire a controlling share of Azorim Investment, Development and Construction.. \nMerkur owns real estate businesses that are partly used for vehicles parking through the \"Success Assets\" company, which has five branches: \" Success Parking Ltd.\" (the largest parking lot franchise owned by him, which focuses mainly on parking lots in Tel Aviv), \"Reit Parking Ltd.\", Bareket Investments and Parking Ltd.\", “Bezeq Parking Ltd.\" (for one parking lot) and \"Neta Parking Ltd. \" .\nIn March 2018, Tsahi completed an impressive 400% profit when he managed to sell a parking facility in Netanya for about 24 million NIS, having bought it only a year earlier at 6.5 million NIS.\nThis achievement by Tsahi, which has already made several “exits” in the parking market, is added up to the impressive sales of parking facilities that Merkur sold in previous years. Among other things, he sold the portfolio he bought from Yitzhak Tshuva for NIS 40 million, as individual parking facilities at a total sales price of about 140 million NIS, at the timeline of approximately only 3 years. \nOne of those parking facilities is the Shtamper parking facility in Netanya, which has 79 parking spaces, which Merkur managed to sell for NIS 13 Million, a sales price that reflects NIS 164,500 per parking space, which also broke a record in Israel for parking at a public parking facility.\n\nToday, Success Parking, as the largest parking company in Israel, serves about 80% of Israel's drivers, and the annual turnover of the parking group is estimated at more than $ 200 Million annually.\n\nAppliCure is a company that develops, manufactures and markets software products for a network environment (Internet and intranet), and its flagship product is a software named dotDefender, which secures a variety of platforms and web-based applications. \nThe company was founded in 2004 by Moshe Bassol (who served as CEO until 2010) and David Alush.\nIn 2007, AppliCure was listed for trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, at a company value of NIS 42 million . The company raised NIS 11 Million on the stock exchange, but presented losses, and soon thereafter the company lost its worth. In the reports of the fourth quarter of 2007, it already became clear that the financing round was almost exhausted, and the company was required to raise additional capital. The British fund Trafalgar Capital supported the company, but however, AppliCure was unable to recover from its losses, and ended the first quarter of 2009 with a \" Going Concern Warning” notice in its reports. \nIn July 2009, the control interest in the company (70%) was sold to the Nika Group, which was under the control of Merkur, for NIS 8 million \n. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company had become profitable for the first time in its history. The Nika Group was established and managed by Tsahi Merkur (who was appointed Chairman of the AppliCure Board of Directors), Eli Hakam, and Fruition (formerly No Risk Ltd. 2004).\nThe company currently operates a number of business models, including SaaS (Software as a Service) and the sale of licenses. The Company currently has approximately 1,500 subscribers and customers who have purchased licenses for the system, Dot-Defender. \n\nIn 2011, Tsahi Merkur founded the start-up DRiiVZ, which aims to manage charging stations for electric vehicles. The company has developed a platform for online cloud management and billing. In this framework it provides solutions and software for infrastructure and charging stations for hybrid and electric vehicles and also the management and streamlining of smart energy projects.\n\nIn 2013, the management system of DRiiVZ was announced by the Dutch Elaad Fund as the world's leading management system, of all the systems examined by it. The E-laad Foundation has the largest public charging network in Europe and is the founder of the global consortium OCCP, which integrates private and public companies that are leading the field of charging infrastructure for electric cars. DRiiVZ has also developed an innovative online vehicle management platform called Vehicle-to-Grid, which enables network management of power transmission from electric vehicles to power grids, including technology that supports energy efficiency. Under this scope, DRiiVZ has integrated projects with leading energy companies in dozens of countries and is active throughout Europe, America and Australia. \n\nDRiiVZ, which is today a world leader in energy and electric transport, and currently serves hundreds of thousands of electric vehicle drivers worldwide, won the world competition in February 2018 and was recognized as the most innovative electric transport company in the world. The announcement came after DRiiVZ competed with 450 companies from 51 countries, surveyed by the Free Electron International Association, which integrates the largest energy companies in the world . \nAccording to Tsahi Merkur, who believes a breakthrough in the field of transportation will be created, among other things, by electric cars, by 2030 most of the cars sold in the world will be electric, including autonomous vehicles that travel independently without a driver.\n\nIn August 2018, Tsahi Merkur has entered into a partnership with the British energy giant Centrica, which is traded and listed on the FTSE 100 on the London Stock Exchange and counts among its holdings British Gas, Scottish Power, Bord Gais Energy and many additional holdings, and has invested in Driivz, which Merkur still controls .\nCentrica is a multi-national British energy company that provides electricity, gas and various services to tens of millions of consumers.\n\nCentrica, through an investment arm that invests in technology companies, Centrica Innovation, has joined up with the London investment fund, Ombu Group, which specializes in investment in advanced technology companies, and together they led an investment round that raised $12 million in Driivz. .\n\nTsahi Merkur initiated and founded the National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need, which operates voluntarily and with the funding of Merkur. Its purpose is to increase the scope of donations for the people in need and for non-profit organizations in Israel, and to improve the transparency of the fundraising organizations in Israel.\nIn addition, a charity fund which is operated entirely with Tsahi’s funding, was established in order to assist the struggling populations, especially sick children and homeless people. As part of the project, an innovative global donation system is being developed that will improve the level of transparency and the efficiency of charity organizations and foundations, and will enable the increase in the amount of donations that can be raised by non-profit organizations and charities, that manage to channel the donations to them in the best possible manner for the ultimate goal for which the donors initially intended to contribute, and also directly to those in need who will be able to reach the hearts of the donors .. Tsahi's system will enable donations of food and clothing, as well as donations to those in need, charities and charity foundations. \nBetter Place is an international operation of electric vehicles, that was conceived and stirred by Shai Agassi in Israel, until October 2012, and then was established by Agassi and Idan Ofer, chairman of the Israeli Corporation, In May 2013, after investing NIS 3 Billion. After failing to raise additional funds, Better Place requested the court to appoint a liquidator, and in July 2013 the court approved the recommendation of the temporary liquidators to sell the company's activity and assets in Israel to the Sunrise group for NIS 18 Million . and without payment of an advance payment. \nAt the end of August 2013, the temporary liquidators appealed to the court to cancel the sale to the Sunrise group, and to sell the activity to Success Assets. However, this sale as well was cancelled at the request of the liquidators, out of a series of 4 consecutive sales transactions that were cancelled for four different buyers. Merkur appealed to the Supreme Court to cancel the decision to cancel the transaction, but until the appeal was heard in March 2014, the company's assets were already sold in parts, and there was no longer any reason to hear the appeal while the sale could not be re-established. The Supreme Court ruled that Merkur's Success Assets were entitled to compensation for the cancellation of the transaction. \n\n"}

Westwood One News News is carried at the top of most hours. WCFO broadcasts with a power of 50,000 watts during the day with a directional antenna pattern using a four tower antenna array, and 160 watts of power at night using one antenna tower in an omnidirectional antenna pattern.\n\nThe sister station to WCFO is WMLB, owned by JW Broadcasting. Prior to becoming WCFO in June 2006, the 1160 kHz facility was the home of WMLB. WWAA was sold to the owner of WMLB, JW Broadcasting, in 2006. The owner, JW Broadcasting, decided to move the WMLB call signs and format from 1160 kHz to the 1690 kHz frequency in order to increase WMLB's coverage area.

In 1995, WMLB changed from country music to Americana, and, although it did not reach all of Atlanta with its 5000-watt signal, it was the only station of its type in the area. The format included familiar names such as Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, Linda Ronstadt, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Bob Dylan, and Tom Petty, as well as less mainstream artists such as John Prine, Guy Clark, Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Townes Van Zandt, Jerry Jeff Walker, Son Volt, Wilco, Steve Earle, Jerry Garcia, and the Atlanta band The Vidalias. WMLB program director Chris Marino won Americana program director of the year from The Gavin Report in 1997.\n\nWKGE and WMLB became \"The Twins: Classic 1160 and Classic 1170.\" WKGE planned to increase its 10,000-watt signal to 50,000 watts. The playlist included \"Palisades Park\" by Freddy Cannon, \"Galveston\" by Glen Campbell, \"Chantilly Lace\" by The Big Bopper, \"Hawaii Five-O\" by The Ventures, \"Suspicion\" by Terry Stafford, \"Little GTO\" by Ronny & the Daytonas, and \"Yes I'm Ready\" by Barbara Mason. The music collection included 9000 songs, including some by The Tams with their original lineup. General manager Ron McCarter, described as \"a voracious record collector,\" said Americana was \"not commercially viable\" but also said it was \"a great format.\" WMLB fans wished the pairing of the two stations had resulted in Americana covering the entire area.\n\nThe power boost by 1160 AM (not including the limited nighttime signal), which became WMLB, involved moving the tower from East Point to Austell. By 2003, when the change took effect, the stations' format was adult standards from local DJs in the morning and afternoon and the Music of Your Life network at other times, with such artists as Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald, Norah Jones, and Diana Krall. The 1170 frequency left the air in 2003.\n\nBy 2005, WMLB had what was described as an \"eclectic\" format.\n\n"}

{"id": "568909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=568909", "title": "William Levitt", "text": "William Levitt\n\nWilliam Jaird Levitt (February 11, 1907 – January 28, 1994) was an American real-estate developer from Brooklyn, New York City. As president of Levitt & Sons, he is widely credited as the father of modern American suburbia. He was named one of \"Time\" Magazine's \"100 Most Influential People of the 20th Century.\"\n\nLevitt was born in 1907 to a Jewish family. His generation was the second since immigrating from Russia and Austria; the paternal grandparents who immigrated to the United States had been a rabbi grandfather from Russia and a grandmother from Austria-Germany. Levitt grew up in Brooklyn, New York. His father was Abraham Levitt, a British-born real estate attorney and part-time investor; his mother was Pauline Biederman. A younger brother, Alfred, was born when William was five years old. William received a public school education at Public School 44 and Boys High School. He then attended New York University for three years, but dropped out before graduating.\n\nIn 1929, William's father Abraham founded a real-estate development company called Levitt & Sons. Levitt & Sons built mostly upscale housing on and around Long Island, New York, in the 1930s. William Levitt served as company president, overseeing all aspects of the company except for the designs of the homes they built, which fell to William's brother Alfred.\n\nDuring World War II, Levitt served in the Navy as a lieutenant in the Seabees. After returning from the war, he saw a need for affordable housing for returning veterans. America's post-war prosperity and baby boom had created a crisis of affordable housing.\n\nEven before returning from the war, Levitt had experimented with mass housing projects, building a 1,600-shack community in Norfolk, Virginia, which was not a success - units remained unsold in 1950. Levitt & Sons' first successful housing development was located on almost of land near Hempstead, Long Island and was named Levittown. The assembly line construction method enabled Levit to build more efficiently than other developers at the time, with teams of specialized workers following each other from house to house to complete incremental steps in the construction. Levitt also reduced costs by freezing out union labor – a move which provoked picket lines – enabling him to use the latest technology, such as spray painting. He also cut out middlemen and purchased many items, including lumber and televisions, directly from manufacturers, as well as constructing his own factory to produce nails. The building of every house was reduced to 27 steps, and sub-contractors were responsible for each step. His mass production of thousands of houses at virtually the same time allowed Levitt to sell them, fully furnished with modern appliances, for as little as $8,000 each ($65,000 in 2009 dollars), which, with the G.I. Bill and Federal housing subsidies, reduced the up-front cost of a house to many buyers to around $400.\n\nLevitt was the cover story in \"Time\" magazine for July 3, 1950, with the tag line \"For Sale: a new way of life.\"\n\nAs Levitt & Sons' president, Levitt proposed and constructed other East Coast developments throughout the 1960s. In 1952, people started buying over 17,000 Levitt-built homes in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In addition, the company built Willingboro, New Jersey, which still has street names such as Levitt Parkway. During the late 1950s, Levitt and Sons constructed \"Belair at Bowie\" in Bowie, Maryland. In the early 1960s, the company built a 5,000-house community in north central New Jersey called Strathmore-at-Matawan.\n\nWilliam took control of Levitt & Sons in 1954, after splitting with Alfred. The company went public in 1960. During the 1960s, when Levitt was leading the company, Levitt & Sons developed properties beyond the American mainland, such as Levittown, Puerto Rico; Lésigny in Seine-et-Marne; and Mennecy in Essonne.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Levitt had become one of the richest men in America, with a fortune estimated in excess of $100 million. He lived in a lavish 30-room mansion on his \"La Coline\" estate in Mill Neck, New York, and spent much of his time on \"La Belle Simone\", his yacht named after his third wife.\n\nLevitt refused to integrate his developments. The Jewish Levitt barred Jews from Strathmore, his first pre-Levittown development on Long Island in New York, and he refused to sell his homes to blacks. His sales contracts also forbade the resale of properties to blacks through restrictive covenants, although in 1957 a Jewish couple resold their house to the first black family to live in a Levitt home. Levitt's all-white policies also led to civil rights protests in Bowie, Maryland in 1963. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union opposed Levitt’s racist policies, and the Federal Housing Administration prepared to refuse mortgages on his next Levittown. Nevertheless, Levitt would not back down and continued planning another whites-only Levittown in Willingboro Township, New Jersey. He fought legal challenges in New Jersey courts until the United States Supreme Court refused to hear his case.\n\nThe 2003 PBS series \"\", by California Newsreel, features Levittown and nearby Roosevelt in documenting systemic racism in the development of the early suburbs.\n\nAfter he had built over 140,000 houses around the world, then 60-year-old Levitt sold the company to ITT for $92 million ($ million today) in July 1967, of which $62 million was in the form of ITT stock. ITT made Levitt president of the renamed Levitt Corp., on condition that Levitt could not move to another United States home building company for ten years. He entered the agreement thinking he would play an active role in ITT affairs, but executives felt Levitt was too old to take on more responsibility. \n\nLevitt remained president under ITT until 1972. During that time he led the subsidiary's development of housing projects in Palm Coast, Florida; Richmond, Virginia; and Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nAfter the restriction against Levitt moving to a new home building company in the United States expired, he was unable to repeat the success he had achieved with Levitt & Sons. He established a series of companies and joint ventures through the 1970s and 1980s which failed. The ITT stock he often used for collateral on these ventures lost 90% of its value, saddling him with great debt. \n\nHe was accused of misappropriation of funds from the charitable Levitt Foundation and agreed to repay $5 million, more than $5 million or $11 million (in 1992). \n\nLevitt died on January 28, 1994, at the age of 86.\n\nWilliam Levitt came to symbolize the new suburban growth with his use of mass-production techniques to construct large developments of houses, eponymously named Levittowns, selling for under $10,000. Many other relatively inexpensive suburban developments soon appeared throughout the country. While he did not invent the building of communities of affordable single-family homes within driving distance of major areas of employment, his innovations in providing affordable housing popularized this type of planned community in the years following World War II.\n\nHis nicknames included \"The King of Suburbia\" and \"Inventor of the Suburb.\" At his height, when he was completing one suburban house every 16 minutes, Levitt compared his successes to those of Henry Ford's automobile assembly line. \"Time\" magazine recognized Levitt as one of the \"100 Most Important People of the 20th Century\" in 1998.\n\nLevitt was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal in 1965.\n\nLevitt married Rhoda Kirshner in November 1929. Their son William Junior was born in 1933, and their second son, James, was born in 1944. The couple divorced in 1959, and Levitt married his secretary and long-time mistress, Alice Kenny. Ten years later, in 1969, Levitt divorced her and married a French art dealer, Simone Korchin.\n\n"}
