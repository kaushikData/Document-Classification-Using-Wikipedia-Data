It was constructed from 1972 to 1974 as headquarters of New York Telephone and has 41 floors. The building also served as the headquarters of NYNEX and Bell Atlantic. Kahn & Jacobs designed the building, which is the 61st tallest in New York. The original facade was said to be designed to resemble the relays which were commonly found inside telephones of the time. From 2006 to 2007, the tower received a $260 million renovation which upgraded the office space from Class B+ to Class A office space. The phone company moved its headquarters to the Verizon Building in the early 2000s, and sold off most of the building, retaining a condominium interest in floors 6-12, where Verizon maintained offices and a telephone exchange serving landlines in Midtown Manhattan. However, in 2013, the company moved its corporate headquarters back to 1095 Avenue of the Americas, following a sale of the upper floors of the Verizon Building.\n\nIn addition to Verizon, other major tenants as of late 2008 include insurance giant MetLife (whose name is outside above the entryway), law firm Dechert LLP, iStar Financial, Lloyds Banking Group, Instinet, Standard Chartered USA, and Stifel. In 2013, Whole Foods Market finalized a deal to open a 32,000 square foot supermarket spread across the first and second floors of the building. Pandora Jewelry, Tourneau, and Equinox Fitness also operate in the base of the building. ASICS abruptly vacated its 5,000 square foot space in October 2015 amid a legal battle with the company’s retail operator, less than a year after moving in.\n\nIn 2015, Ivanhoé Cambridge and Callahan Capital Properties purchased 1095 Avenue of the Americas from The Blackstone Group for $2.2 billion, the most expensive transaction involving a single office building in New York City since 2008. In August 2016, Real Summit Investment, a real estate investment subsidiary of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s Exchange Fund, paid $1.15 billion for a 49% stake in the building.\n\nIn 2016, Salesforce.com signed a deal to rename the building Salesforce Tower and the San Francisco-based company will eventually occupy 5 floors. The first Salesforce employees in NYC to move to the new office arrived on Monday 14 November 2016. U.S. Bancorp signed a lease for 68,000 square feet in September 2016 and Apollo Global Management followed in July 2017 with a 70,000 square foot lease.\n\n\n"}

ABC analysis divides an inventory into three categories—\"A items\" with very tight control and accurate records, \"B items\" with less tightly controlled and good records, and \"C items\" with the simplest controls possible and minimal records.\n\nThe ABC analysis provides a mechanism for identifying items that will have a significant impact on overall inventory cost, while also providing a mechanism for identifying different categories of stock that will require different management and controls.\n\nThe ABC analysis suggests that inventories of an organization are not of equal value.\nThus, the inventory is grouped into three categories (A, B, and C) in order of their estimated importance.\n\n'A' items are very important for an organization. Because of the high value of these 'A' items, frequent value analysis is required. In addition to that, an organization needs to choose an appropriate order pattern (e.g. 'just-in-time') to avoid excess capacity. 'B' items are important, but of course less important than 'A' items and more important than 'C' items. Therefore, 'B' items are intergroup items. 'C' items are marginally important.\n\nThere are no fixed threshold for each class, different proportion can be applied based on objective and criteria. ABC Analysis is similar to the Pareto principle in that the 'A' items will typically account for a large proportion of the overall value but a small percentage of the number of items.<br>\nExamples of ABC class are\n\nAnother recommended breakdown of ABC classes:\n\n\nMajor ERP packages have built-in function of ABC analysis. User can execute ABC analysis based on user defined criteria and system apply ABC code to items (parts).\n\nComputed (calculated) ABC analysis delivers a precise mathematical calculation of the limits for the ABC classes.\nIt uses an optimization of cost (i.e. number of items) versus yield (i.e. sum of their estimated importance). \nComputed ABC was, for example, applied to feature selection for biomedical data, business process management and bankruptcy prediction.\n\nActual distribution of ABC class in the electronics manufacturing company with 4,051 active parts.\n\nUsing this distribution of ABC class and change total number of the parts to 14,213. \n\nWhen equal purchasing policy is applied to all 14,213 components, for example weekly delivery and re-order point (safety stock) of two weeks' supply, the factory will have 16,000 deliveries in four weeks and average inventory will be 2½ weeks' supply.\n\n\nIn comparison, when weighed purchasing policy is applied based on ABC class, for example C class monthly (every four weeks) delivery with re-order point of three weeks' supply, B class bi-weekly delivery with re-order point of 2 weeks' supply, A class weekly delivery with re-order point of 1 week's supply, total number of delivery in 4 weeks will be (A 200×4=800)+(B 400×2=800)+(C 3,400×1=3,400)=5,000 and average inventory will be (A 75%×1.5weeks)+(B 15%x3 weeks)+(C 10%×3.5 weeks)=1.925 weeks' supply.\nBy applying weighed control based on ABC classification, required man-hours and inventory level are drastically reduced.\nThe ABC concept is based on Pareto's law. If too much inventory is kept, the ABC analysis can be performed on a sample. After obtaining the random sample, the following steps are carried out for the ABC analysis. \n\n\n"}

Selangor and the Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur]] Federal Territory have the largest concentration of MIA membership with 13,125 and 7,351 members respectively. http://www.mia.org.my/new/members_statistics_state.asp\n\nMIA sets the By-Laws (On Professional conduct & Ethics) and auditing standards for the accountancy profession in Malaysia, which are in line with the standards issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB).\n\nThe Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants (MICPA), which was established in 1958, is another accountancy body that is involved in the training and development of accountants in Malaysia. Apart from that, accountancy bodies from the Commonwealth countries such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia (ICAA) and CPA Australia are also active in training and developing Malaysians towards attaining professional accountancy qualifications.\n\nAfter the Malaysian Institute of Accountant (MIA) and Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants (MICPA), the third largest accounting body in Malaysia is Institute of Commercial and Industrial Accountants, Malaysia (ICIA).\n\nThe institute (ICIA) has signed an MRA with IPA Australia with reciprocal recognition: of membership status. This means that associates of the ICIA with recognized tertiary qualifications in accounting are eligible to be admitted as an Associate member of the IPA (AIPA). In addition Certified members of the ICIA (deemed to be the equivalent of an Australian bachelor's degree), having completed all the required ICIA professional exams and the required 3 years’ Practical Training with an approved training organization are eligible to be admitted as a full member (MIPA) of the IPA.\n\nAccounting courses are offered both by the public and private higher education institutions in Malaysia.

The Financial Reporting Act also establishes the Financial Reporting Foundation, which is the body that is responsible to oversee MASB's performance and financial arrangement.\n\nThe MASB had announced the effort to bring Malaysia to be in full convergence with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by 2012.\n\nIn February 2014, the MASB issued Malaysian Private Entities Reporting Standard (MPERS) and this sets a new milestone for financial reporting of private entities in Malaysia. MPERS is based substantially on the International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs) issued by the IASB in July 2009. The new reporting framework, known as the MPERS Framework, is effective for financial statements beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early application permitted.\n\nPrivate entities now have a choice of continuing with the existing Private Entity Reporting Standards (PERS) Framework, or apply the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) Framework (mandatory for non-private entities, except transitioning entities), or by 1 January 2016, mandatory migration to the new MPERS Framework. As the requirement for first-time adoption of MPERS is retrospective, it is important the private entities prepare in advance if they have to migrate to the MPERS Framework or the MFRS Framework in the near future. \n\nAs at 30 June 2015, there are 1,407 firms which are offering auditing services and another 836 firms providing other accountancy related services http://www.mia.org.my/new/circularandresources_miaannualreport.asp .

He was brought to testify at hearings of the US Congress in May 1987.\n\nCalero was born on December 22, 1931 in Managua to Adolfo Calero Orozco (1899–1980) and María Portocarrero (1911–1944), who had married in 1927. The oldest of four children, he studied in the United States, graduating from University of Notre Dame in 1953 and Syracuse University. In Managua, he managed the Coca-Cola bottling plant.\n\nCalero was associated with the Conservative Party of Nicaragua. From 1963, he was a CIA information source. Before the 1979 overthrow of the government of Anastasio Somoza, he had been briefly imprisoned, which gave credibility to his claims to have opposed Somoza as well as the Sandinistas.\n\nIn early 1983, he joined the political directorate of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). By October he became its president, but many observers wondered about his real power because of the political wing's weak control over the military wing. In a bid to unify contra factions and win aid from the US Congress, he became a member of the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) triumvirate with Alfonso Robelo and Arturo Cruz.\n\nCalero controlled the FDN through his deputy, Aristides Sánchez, and the contras' military commander, Enrique Bermúdez, an alliance so tight that it was dubbed the \"Iron Triangle.\"\n\nHowever, there were tensions below the surface. After the Sapoa ceasefire, Calero exploited discontent with Bermudez among the FDN's field commanders in an effort to push him out. Heavy-handed intervention by the CIA helped to crush that effort. Later, however, other commanders, with the blessing of the US State Department, ousted both their political and military leadership.\nOn July 26, 2011, he published his book \"Cronicas de un Contra\", which narrates his participation during the 1980s in Nicaragua.\n\nCalero married Maria Ernestina Lacayo on December 7, 1957. The couple had two children, Myriam (b. 1958) and Adolfo (1960–1994). Calero has three grandchildren. He had three younger siblings: Myriam (b. 1933-2018) Mario (1935–1993) and Martha (b. 1943).\n\nCalero died in Managua on June 2, 2012 after complications from pneumonia and kidney failure. He is survived by his wife, daughter, three grandchildren, and two sisters.\n\nIn the 2017 film \"American Made\", he was portrayed by Daniel Lugo, in a highly innacurate protrayal of his character and his commitment to Nicaragua's democratization.\n\n<br>\n"}

After an arrest in 2003, he publicly claimed that he paid large bribes to many Thai police officers. He then sold some of his massage parlors, formed his own political party and unsuccessfully ran for Bangkok governor in August 2004. In 2005 he was elected for a four-year term to the Thai House of Representatives, but in 2006 the Constitutional Court removed him from parliament. In October 2008 he again ran for governor of Bangkok as an independent but was not elected. In the July 2011 general election his party won four seats in the House of Representatives. He used the pseudonym Davis Kamol on occasion.\n\nChuwit is the son of a Hong Kong-born, Chinese father and a Thai mother. He graduated from the Faculty of Commerce and Accountancy at Thammasat University, and then earned a Master of Business Administration degree at University of San Diego in San Diego, California, United States. Later, he also earned a Masters of Political Science (Politics and Governments) at Thammasat University.\n\nChuwit controls the Davis Group, a business that consists of six Bangkok massage parlours near Ratchadaphisek Road, which employ around 600 women each: Copacabana, Victoria's Secret, Honolulu, Hi Class, Emmanuelle, and Julianna. The massage parlours cater mainly to wealthy Thais and operate within a \"grey area\" of the law: massage parlors are legal, but prostitution is not. Prices are from 3,000 to 6,000 baht for a two-hour session. The Davis Group's holdings also include the Davis Bangkok Hotel, Thai villas and a shopping mall on Sukhumvit Road Soi 24., which is one of the most expensive areas in Bangkok.\n\nIn January 2003, Chuwit was accused of hiring around 600 men to raze several bars, shops, a laundry and a travel agency on \"Sukhumvit Square\", a plot of land he owns on Sukhumvit Soi 10. This was an apparent attempt to remove the low-rent tenants so that the land could be developed. The tenants believed they had valid leases from another company and were not notified of the raid, which took place early on a Sunday morning. Chuwit was arrested and spent a month in prison. He denied responsibility and was finally released on bail.\n\nThe police, whom he says he had bribed an average US$160,000 a month over 10 years, refused to protect him, so he went public, releasing the names of the top officers, the sums they were paid, and their frequent visits to his six massage parlors. He also claimed that \"VIP\" policemen received free service in his parlours, an allegation that was later confirmed in interviews with some of the masseuses. Following an investigation, several prominent policemen were suspended or demoted. Chuwit also accused his prison wardens of corruption, as they accepted bribes from him.\n\nShortly after his corruption revelations, Chuwit disappeared for two days. He later claimed he was abducted and abused by police; however, others believe he had staged his own disappearance. Chuwit's massage parlours were then raided and some of his bank accounts were frozen. He was also charged with procuring minors for prostitution because three masseues under the age of 18 were found working in one of his parlours. He was acquitted in June 2004, as the court found the girls had used forged ID cards and Chuwit was not held responsible. During the same month, Chuwit sold three of his parlours, saying that police harassment had made operations difficult for him.\n\nIn a February 2004 interview, Chuwit claimed that he had paid Thai policemen to clear his Sukhumvit Soi 10 property. When the issue became public, the police allegedly demanded more money, which he refused to pay. They turned against him, and he revealed his bribe payments as a response.\n\nIn July 2006, after a three-year trial, Chuwit and 130 associates were acquitted of the razing charges; however, a corporate lawyer was sentenced to eight months in prison for paying army engineers to destroy the businesses. Chuwit converted the area on Sukhumvit Soi 10 into a public park named \"Chuvit Garden\" for about 100 million baht.\n\nChuvit Garden is the last large empty parcel of land in the Sukhumvit area. The land alone is estimated to be worth more than US$160 million or 5,500 million baht.\n\nIn September 2003, Chuwit formed his own political party, called \"First Thai Nation\". In April 2004 he announced that he was running for governor of Bangkok. He planned to spend about 20 million baht on his campaign, with corruption in the police and government as his main campaign topic. The Bangkok governor elections were held on 29 August 2004. Chuwit placed third, with some 300,000 votes, or about 16 percent of the vote.\n\nFor the 2005 legislative elections, Chuwit merged his party with the conservative Chart Thai Party. He ran successfully as a party list candidate, becoming a member of parliament.\n\nIn May 2005 he began hosting a weekly call-in radio show, during which he listened to complaints from the public.\n\nIn January 2006, however, the Constitutional Court revoked his MP status. A candidate must be a member of a political party for at least 90 days before the general election and the court found that Chuwit had not joined Chart Thai in time.\n\nIn 2008, he again declared his candidacy for governor of Bangkok. As was the case in 2004, he placed third. He admitted that his campaign may have suffered when he punched a reporter in the face for allegedly describing Chuwit as \"unmanly\".\n\nIn May 2011 Chuwit formed a new political party, \"Love Thailand\" (Rak Prathetthai). In the 2011 Thai general election, the party won four seats in the House of Representatives. He had campaigned as a protest candidate and anti-corruption watchdog.\n\nIn September 2012, the \"Bangkok Post\" published an audio recording of a lecture given by Chuwit at Hatyai University in southern Thailand. Chuwit spoke to the students about how Thai police make money from the sex industry, and the \"Post\" noted that the topic is \"a subject not normally taught in university courses.\"\n\nHis daughter, Trakarnta Kamolvisit (Thaia), studied at Millfield School, United Kingdom; and graduated with a degree in Economics from University of San Francisco. In 2017, she has enrolled MSc Construction Economics and Management at University College London (UCL)\n\n\n"}

It can also be understood to regulate corporate contracts, hiring practices, and the manufacture and sales of consumer goods. Many countries have adopted civil codes that contain comprehensive statements of their commercial law.\n\nIn the United States, commercial law is the province of both the United States Congress, under its power to regulate interstate commerce, and the states, under their police power. Efforts have been made to create a unified body of commercial law in the United States; the most successful of these attempts has resulted in the general adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in all 50 states (with some modification by state legislatures), the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.\n\nVarious regulatory schemes control how commerce is conducted, particularly \"vis-a-vis\" employees and customers. Privacy laws, safety laws (e.g., the Occupational Safety and Health Act in the United States), and food and drug laws are some examples.\n\n\n"}

This is a consequence of regulation, local norms, and the set of information, privacy, and business policies concerning corporate decision-making and operations openness to employees, stakeholders, shareholders and the general public. From the perspective of outsiders, transparency can be defined simply as the perceived quality of intentionally shared information from the corporation. \n\nRecent research suggests there are three primary dimensions of corporate transparency: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy. To increment transparency, corporations infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with stakeholders. For example, governance decisions to voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists indicate disclosure; decisions to actively limit the use of technical terminology, fine print, or complicated mathematical notations in the firm's correspondence with suppliers and customers indicate clarity; and decisions to not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in the firm's communications with investors indicate accuracy. The \"strategic\" management of transparency therefore involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the firm's objectives. \n\nStandard & Poor's has included a definition of corporate transparency in its GAMMA Methodology aimed at analysis and assessment of corporate governance. As a part of this work, Standard & Poor's Governance Services publishes the Transparency Index which calculates the average score for the largest public companies in various countries.\n\nTransparency International publishes an index of corporate transparency based on public disclosure of anti-corruption programmes and country-by-country reporting. Corporate transparency is also used to refer to radical transparency in corporate governance. Transparency Index calculated as the average score for the largest public companies in various countries.\n\nCorporate transparency is also used to refer to radical transparency in corporate governance.\n\nCorporations may be transparent to investors, the public at large, and to customers.\n\nOpening up the customer support channels may mean using a feedback tool which allows users to publicly vote on new developments, having an open internet forum, or actively responding to social media questions.\n\n\n"}

The HPC held a public consultation on the PLG recommendations, which ran for three months in 2009. Following the consultation, the PLG was reconvened and had its last meeting on 2 February 2011.\n\nIn February 2011, the Government published a command paper, \"Enabling Excellence\", which set out the coalition government's policy on professional regulation. The paper outlined a system of what it called \"assured voluntary registration\" and said that in the future statutory regulation will only be considered where there is a \"compelling case\", and where \"voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage this risk\". Later that month, the HPC's Chief Executive Marc Seale wrote to Anne Milton MP, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health, seeking clarification of the coalition government's policy on the statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors.\n\nAt its meeting on 31 March 2011 the Council discussed the response received from Anne Milton MP. The letter said: \"...it is not currently our intention to proceed with statutory regulation of psychotherapists and counsellors\".\n\nThe largest UK counselling organisation is the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). It grew from the Standing Conference for the Advancement of Counselling, a grouping of organisations inaugurated in 1970 at the instigation of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Membership was extended to include individuals when in 1977, with the aid of a grant from the Home Office Voluntary Service Unit, the British Association for Counselling was founded. In 1978 the headquarters was moved from London to Rugby courtesy of the National Marriage Guidance Council which provided free accommodation to help the association establish itself.\n\nIn September 2000, the Association recognised that it no longer represented just counselling, but also psychotherapy. It changed its name to the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). BACP is now the largest and broadest body within the sector with approximately 26,000 individual members. BACP participates in the development of counselling and psychotherapy at an international level.\n\nBACP is recognised by most health providers and claims a membership of several thousand.\n\n\nAccording to the introduction on their main website The Survivors Trust is a national umbrella agency for over 125 specialist voluntary sector agencies throughout the UK and Ireland providing a range of counselling, therapeutic and support services working with women, men and children who are victims/survivors of rape, sexual violence and sexual abuse. The organisation aims to offer a national collective voice to support and empower survivor groups, to educate and inform acknowledgment of and response to sexual abuse on a local and national level.\n\nThe National Counselling Society (NCS) is a not-for-profit membership organisation, founded by a group of counsellors, psychotherapists, psychologists and hypnotherapists in 1999. The aim of the NCS is to promote and support the practice of counselling, and does so by offering a range of services to members, including a comprehensive training programme. The NCS also benefits the patients of counsellors by ensuring that the counsellors in their organisation follow their stringent code of ethics; facing expulsion if they deviate or break any of their established codes of conduct and practice.\n\n\nCOSCA is a professional body for counselling and psychotherapy in Scotland, which seeks to advance all forms of counselling and psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills.\n\nAccording to the organisations website, COSCA’s aims are to increase accessibility to counselling and psychotherapy, develop ethically-based professional standards and quality assurance for counselling, psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills, increase access to training and information on counselling, psychotherapy and counselling skills, deliver a range of services that meet the needs of the counselling and psychotherapy field, provide opportunities for sharing knowledge, experience and resources for the advancement of counselling, psychotherapy and the use of counselling skills in Scotland.\n\n\nThe Counselling Society is one of a number of UK counselling professional organisations. According to the introduction on their website in 2007, the Counselling Society launched a campaign by contacting every UK MP, Peer and other national stakeholder via Blake’s Parliamentary Yearbook. It proposed a criminal offence of “abuse by a healthcare professional” which would include counsellors as a matter of public safety. This would give courts powers to ban abusive counsellors from practising.\n\n\nAccording to their main page, the Human Givens Institute (HGI) is a membership organisation and resource open to anyone wishing to support the new school of psychology known as the Human Givens approach.\n"}

A dive team searched for evidence but nothing relevant was found.\n\nDowntown is home to three performing arts venues and a movie theatre, the most for any central business district in the Inland Empire. The city is planning a new district along Fourth Street. The key aspect of the plan is to make the area around the California Theatre and future Regal San Bernardino Theatre Square Stadium 14 site on Fourth Street as an area for entertainment and dining.

They are the second level of a top-down approach to understanding the risks of an organization. Generally, entity refers to the entire company.\n\nAs a result of several accounting and auditing scandals, congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 of the act requires company management to assess and report on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. It also requires the company's independent auditor to attest to management's disclosures regarding the effectiveness of internal control. The act also created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).\n\nThe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) became the primary regulator of audits of publicly traded companies. In June 2007, the PCAOB adopted Auditing Standard 2201 (Supersedes AS No. 5). This standard contains the standards over performing an audit of internal control over financial reporting that is integrated with an audit of financial statements.\n\nThe auditor must test entity-level controls that are important to the auditor's conclusion about whether the company has effective internal control over financial reporting. Depending on the auditor's evaluation of the effectiveness of the entity-level controls, the auditor can increase or decrease the amount of testing that they will perform.\n\nEntity-level controls vary greatly in nature and precision. Their effect on the audit plan varies according to how precise they are.\n\nEntity-level controls, along with all other internal controls should be evaluated by independent auditors according to SAS 109 (AU 314) issued by the AICPA. SAS 109 stipulates that \"auditors should obtain an understanding of the five components of internal control sufficient to assess the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to error or fraud, and to design the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedures.\"\n\nThe information gathered from obtaining an understanding of the five components of internal control should be used to do the following:\n\nEntity-level controls are generally included in the testing.\n\nThe aforementioned five components of internal control refer to the five parts of the COSO framework.

If they are weak, inadequate, or nonexistent, they can produce material weaknesses relating to an audit of internal control and material misstatements in the financial statements of the company. The presence of material misstatements could result in receiving an adverse opinion on internal controls and a qualified opinion on the financial statements. Material misstatements are expensive to fix, and receiving an adverse or qualified opinion generally results in a drop in stock price of a publicly traded company.\n\n\n"}

The most widely used fair trade certification is FLO International's, the International Fairtrade Certification Mark, used in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Fair Trade Certified Mark is the North American equivalent of the International Fairtrade Certification Mark. As of January 2011, there were over 1000 companies certified to the FLO International's certification and a further 1000 or so certified to other ethical and fairtrade certification schemes around the world.\n\nThe Fairtrade International certification system covers a wide range of products, including banana, coffee, cocoa, cotton, cane sugar, flowers and plants, honey, dried fruit, fruit juices, herbs, spices, tea, nuts and vegetables. These commodities have different locations of production and number of farmers and workers covered for production and distribution.\n\nFair trade is a strategy for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, aiming at creating greater equity in the international trading system. Through trading partnerships with marginalised farmers and craftspeople in developing countries, social and economic opportunities are created for these producers in a way that more customers are accessible to their products and a better deal is issued. In return, the producers have to comply with all the standards laid down by Fairtrade International.\n\nIn reality, packers in developed countries pay a fee to the Fairtrade organisation for the right to use the Fairtrade certification logo. Importers of fairtrade certified products are required to pay exporters a price higher than the market price of non-fairtrade certified products, so as to cover the additional costs used by Fairtrade certified firms in marketing and inspection. Any surplus after paying these costs must be used for local social, environmental and economic projects \n\nFairtrade Standards are designed to aid the sustainable development of some smaller producers and agricultural workers in third world countries. In order to become certified Fairtrade producers, the cooperatives and their fellow farmers have to strictly comply with the standards laid down by Fairtrade International. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, is responsible for inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 70 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nThe general standards set for different stakeholders are listed as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe Fairtrade system mainly consists of two types of pricing, which are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporters according to the proportion of output companies are able to sell with the brand ‘Fairtrade Certified’, typically ranging from 17% to up to 60% of their turnover in some cases.\n\n\nThe Fairtrade system has committed to a programme of Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL), which aims at generating recommendations and analysis in support of greater effectiveness and impact. Ongoing market progress is monitored by market-facing organizations present in countries where Fairtrade certified products are sold; market data is consolidated by Fairtrade International on an annual basis. These data are gathered to form a core basis for the understanding of the dynamics of how certification is developing, and how the impacts of Fairtrade are being distributed between producer organizations, geographies and products.\n\nFairtrade’s governance bodies also review key results and evaluate regularly in order to improve strategy and decision-making. These results are publicised within staff throughout the Fairtrade system and relevant stakeholders for further discussion of findings and recommendations.\n\nThe Fairtrade Foundation does not monitor how much of the extra amount of money paid to exporters reaches the farmers. As the cooperatives incur relatively heavy fees on inspection, certification and marketing, only a small amount of money is retained for the farmers. In general, Fairtrade producers are only able to sell 18% to 37% of their output as Fairtrade certified over years, while the rest are sold as uncertified at the market prices.\n\nFair Trade is profitable for traders in rich countries rather than that in poor countries. In order to qualify as Fairtrade producers, cooperatives must meet the strict standards set by Fairtrade International, implying that their fellow farmers must be quite skilful and educated. However, it is criticised that these farmers are predominantly from poorest countries, thus lacking the power to bargain with the cooperatives. Corruption even occurs in some cases.\n\nThere have been complaints that Fairtrade certified products should not be sold through a monopsonist cooperative because it may be inefficient and corruption easily takes place. Fairtrade farmers should have the right to choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperatives are going bankrupt \n\n"}

He was one of the founders of the Pickwick Club in Wellington.\n\nShortly after his arrival, Hunter asked Samuel Parnell, a carpenter he had met on the ship, to build him a store on Lambton Quay, to which Parnell agreed, provided he only worked eight hours a day, the beginning of the Eight Hour Day in New Zealand. As there were only three carpenters in Wellington, Hunter reluctantly agreed to this condition.\n\nHunter's eldest son, George Hunter and his grandson Sir George Hunter were both Members of Parliament.\n\nPrior to coming to New Zealand, Hunter had worked for a major mercantile establishment in Aberdeen. He moved to London where he worked as a merchant until leaving in 1839 for New Zealand with the New Zealand Company.\n\nHe was in business on Willis Street with Kenneth Bethune as general and shipping merchants, and lived in Tinakori Road, where Premier House was later built. Hunter was the Storemaster-General of the New Zealand Company In April 1840 he was appointed as a Director of the Wellington Branch of the Union Bank of Australia. In 1841 Hunter was appointed to the Committee of the New Zealand Flax Association.\n\nHunter's first appointment to public office in Wellington was as a member of the Management Committee of the Port Nicholson Exchange Room and Public Library. He was one of the first Justices of the Court in Wellington, which was founded in October 1841, having been appointed a Justice of the Peace some time earlier. Hunter was also involved in creating regulations for managing Wellington Harbour.\n\nWith the passing of the Municipal Corporation Bill in 1842, Wellington was able to elect its own mayor and aldermen. On 3 October 1842, Hunter, with the most votes of the 12 aldermen elected to the new Wellington Borough, was declared elected. Initial business of the Council was the appointment of officers and organising its finances.\n\nIn 1843, while attending a meeting to express sympathy for the victims of the Wairau Affray he caught a chill and died a few days later. His funeral was a significant one, attended by both local Māori and Pākehā alike. He was buried at Bolton Street Cemetery.\n\nHe was succeeded as mayor by William Guyton.\n\n\n"}

LNCs assist attorneys in reading medical records and understanding medical terminology and healthcare issues to achieve the best results for their clients. The specialty is a relatively recent one, beginning in the mid-1980s.\n\nA legal nurse consultant bridges gaps in an attorney's knowledge. While the attorney is an expert on legal issues, the LNC is an expert on nursing and the health care system. LNCs screen cases for merit, assist with discovery; conduct the existing literature and medical research; review medical records; identify standards of care; prepare reports and summaries on the extent of injury or illness; create demonstrative evidence; and locate or act as expert witnesses. The legal nurse consultant acts as a specialized member of the litigation team whose professional contributions are often critical to achieving a fair and just outcome for all parties.\n\nA legal nurse consultant differs from a paralegal in that a paralegal assists attorneys in the delivery of legal services and frequently requires a legal education, while a legal nurse consultant is first and foremost a practictioner of nursing, and legal education is not necessarily a prerequisite. A legal nurse consultant uses existing expertise as a health care professional to consult and educate clients on specific medical and nursing issues in their cases.\n\nAside from within law firms, LNCs may also be found working for government agencies, insurance companies and HMOs, in hospitals as part of the risk management department, and may also be in independent practice.\n\nThe American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants (AALNC), which was founded in 1989, is a non-profit membership organization whose mission is to promote legal nurse consulting as a nursing speciality. The Association also promulgates a Code of Ethics for the Legal Nurse Consultant practitioner. As of 2001, the Association had approximately 4,000 members, the majority of whom had joined after 1994.\n\nThere are a number of training courses and certifications available for LNCs. The American Legal Nurse Consultant Certification Board offers an online examination which is the only LNC certification exam credited by the American Board of Nursing Specialties. Other training and certification programs are available from both commercial and non-commercial organizations. As of 2001, the American Bar Association sanctioned 28 LNC programs across the United States.\n\nNotes\n"}

The AACSB accredits business schools by evaluating critical areas of each school to ensure that it provides top-quality education, and schools can apply for the accounting accreditation, which focusses on the schools' accounting programs, in addition to business accreditation.\n\nAccreditation is gained and maintained via a peer-review system, and schools are assessed in the context of their respective missions rather than against a fixed standard. To apply for accounting accreditation, a school is required either to already hold the business accreditation, or to apply for both the business and accounting accreditations at the same time.\n\nThe initial accounting accreditation process starts with the submission of an eligibility application, and includes self-evaluations and peer reviews. The business school and the accounting academic unit are evaluated on their alignment with the AACSB's accreditation standards; under the standard for accounting accreditation, an accounting academic unit is evaluated based on its mission, intellectual contributions, and financial strategies for achieving its mission. For example, one of the bases of evaluation is whether the academic unit has produced intellectual contributions that have affected accounting, business and management \"in ways that are consistent with the mission, expected outcomes, and strategies of the unit\". Subsequently, the accounting accreditation is extended via 5-year review cycles.\n\nAs of 2013, the AACSB estimated that 5% of all business programs internationally, and most top business programs in the United States, held AACSB accreditation. AACSB accreditation is seen as a standard requirement in graduate business education, and universities are more likely to accept transfer credit earned from accredited schools; it has been called \"the hallmark of excellence in business education\".\n\n"}

{"id": "50441727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50441727", "title": "Nuclear industry in South Australia", "text": "Nuclear industry in South Australia\n\nThe established nuclear industry in South Australia is focused on uranium mining, milling and the export of uranium oxide concentrate for use in the production of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants. The state is home to the world's largest known single deposit of uranium, which is worked by BHP Billiton at the Olympic Dam mine. Contaminated legacy sites exist at Maralinga and Emu Field, where nuclear weapons tests were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s and at former uranium mines and milling sites. Nuclear waste is stored by CSIRO at Woomera and future waste storage prospects were considered during the deliberations of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission in 2016. The Commission has recommended that South Australia considers opportunities in nuclear waste storage (including developing a repository for spent nuclear fuel), the establishment of a nuclear fuel leasing scheme and the repeal of prohibitions which currently prevent future nuclear industrial development nationally.\n\nIn June 2017, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott acknowledged fellow former Prime Minister Bob Hawke's support for expanding the nuclear industry and asserted that the \"Australian Labor government under Premier Jay Weatherill would like to develop new industries to supplement the uranium mine at Roxby Downs. Why not have a nuclear submarine servicing facility in that state – and the industries that would inevitably spin-off?\"\n\nUranium mining has occurred in South Australia, since the early 20th century, when radium was the target mineral in uranium-bearing ore. During the Cold War, the Playford government facilitated the development of the Radium Hill uranium mine and the associated Port Pirie uranium treatment complex. These closed in the early 1960s after a seven-year contract of supply had been fulfilled. In the 1970s, the discovery of a massive uranium-bearing IOCG orebody near Roxby Downs led to the eventual opening of the Olympic Dam mine in 1988. In the 2000s, the sector expanded to include in-situ leach mining operations at Beverley, Four Mile and Honeymoon. As of May 2016, Beverley and Honeymoon mines are in care and maintenance mode owing to weak uranium prices in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nExploration for uranium in South Australia reached a record high in 2006 with forty companies exploring for the mineral.\n\nUranium mined in South Australia is exported, where it is used in the production of nuclear fuel for use in nuclear power plants. In 2013, uranium oxide concentrate produced in South Australia was being exported to Britain, France, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Canada and the United States. In 2011, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill expressed his support for exporting uranium to India, despite its status as a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. By December 2015, no further barriers remained preventing such trade.\n\nConcentrations of nuclear waste in South Australia exist in the tailings ponds at the Olympic Dam mine, at the site of the former Port Pirie uranium treatment works and in the tailings block at the former Radium Hill mine. CSIRO operates a nuclear waste storage facility at Woomera in the state's far north. Unsuccessful attempts were made by the Howard Government to establish further nuclear waste storage facilities in South Australia between 1998 and 2004.\n\nA prospective nuclear waste storage site at Barndioota was announced in 2015. The property is owned by Grant Chapman, and the traditional owners are the Adnyamathanha. The site is a candidate for a future National Nuclear Waste Management Facility, where domestically produced nuclear waste, and repatriated, reprocessed spent nuclear fuel from Australia's research reactors at Lucas Heights would be stored. Two other candidate sites exist near Kimba on Eyre Peninsula, and as of 2017, community consultation there is ongoing.\n\nThe Kimba sites are located in the federal electorate of Grey, for which Rowan Ramsay is the sitting member. Ramsey has publicly advocated for the establishment of nuclear waste storage facilities in South Australia, and has stated that he would be comfortable storing it on his own property. Ramsay did not nominate his own property for the project after receiving advice that it would constitute a conflict of interest. Opinion on the benefits and risks associated with establishing a facility has divided the township of Kimba.\n\nOpponents of the establishment of a new national facility for domestically produced nuclear waste believe that such waste should be stored long-term at Lucas Heights, where much of the waste was and continues to be generated. Spokespeople for the opposition include Jim Green of Friends of the Earth and David Sweeney of the Australian Conservation Foundation.\n\nThe prospect of storing nuclear waste in the tunnels of the Olympic Dam mine has also been speculated upon by opinion writers, politicians and the community.\n\nSupport for the development of new nuclear waste storage facilities in South Australia was expressed by the Committee for Adelaide on 6 May 2016.\n\nThe Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission's final report, which was delivered to the Governor of South Australia on 6 May 2016 recommended the consideration of the establishment of a repository for imported spent nuclear fuel in South Australia. The report was released in full on 9 May 2016.\n\nThe report was put before a Citizens Jury, which ultimately voted not to proceed with investigating the prospect of importing spent nuclear fuel for storage and disposal in South Australia. In December 2016, a group of prominent citizens signed an open letter expressing an opposing view. It stated:\"We, the undersigned, call on South Australia’s elected representatives of all parties to continue to explore this opportunity. We request further investigations into issues that a) are essential for better understanding project feasibility and b) could be investigated at relatively low cost. We call for partnership between the State Government and relevant Federal Government agencies to formally meet with prospective client nations in order to gain greater certainty and ensure we are fully informed as to the nature of this opportunity.\"Signatories were: Fraser Ainsworth AM, Rob Chapman, Tim Cooper AM, Di Davidson AM, Colin Dunsford AM, Geoff Day OAM, Robert Gerard AO, Ian Gould AM, Kathy Gramp, Jim Hazel, Mike Heard, David Klingberg AO, Theo Maras AM, Karlene Maywald, Jim McDowell, Mike Miller AO, Tanya Monro, Creagh O'Connor AM, Leanna Read, Karen Reynolds, Richard Ryan AO, Antony Simpson, Michael Terlet AO, Meera Verma, Graham Walters and Stephen Young.\n\nA similar letter was published in March 2017 on Ben Heard's website, \"Bright New World\". Many of the former signatories signed again, and the following new names were added: Rick Allert AO, Amanda Blair, Corey Bradshaw, Mark Butcher, Matt Clemow, Greg Clothier, Brian Cunningham, Colin Goodall, John Heard AM, Mark Malcolm, Hon. Ian McLachlan AO, Carolyn Mitchell, Craig Mudge AO, Goran Roos, Raymond Spencer, Lissa Van Camp, Jodie Van Deventer, Hon. Trish White, Paul Willis and Stephen Yarwood.\n\nIn March 2017, it was estimated that $30 million would need to be spent to manage nuclear waste stored at Woomera. Barrels containing the wastes were found to be rusting and deteriorating.\n\nA series of British nuclear weapons tests were conducted at Maralinga and Emu Field during the 1950s and early 1960s. Land remains contaminated at these sites and access is restricted.\n\nAustralia has no domestic nuclear weapons nor the capability to develop them. Australia is allied with countries which do maintain nuclear arsenals. As of 2016 the Liberal-National Coalition does not support a prospective ban on the possession of nuclear weapons, while the Australian Labor Party and Australian Greens do.\n\nIn 2015, a Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission was initiated by the Government of South Australia. It was tasked with investigating opportunities and risks associated with potential expansion of the state's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. Commissioner Kevin Scarce delivered its final report to the Governor of South Australia on 6 May 2016. The Commission's final report recommended the repeal of prohibitions preventing nuclear industrial development in Australia, including the legalisation of nuclear power generation. The report recommended the establishment of a facility to store international stockpiled spent nuclear fuel and the consideration of a nuclear fuel leasing scheme to accompany it. The latter was also described by the Commission as a potential enabler for future enrichment and fuel processing activities, though such further processing developments were deemed to not be feasible within the next decade. The establishment of nuclear power generation in South Australia was also deemed inappropriate given the state's high penetration of solar and wind power.\n\nThe Government of South Australia has allocated $3.6 million to the Department of the Premier and Cabinet for 2016–17 \"to enable the government to engage with the community to develop an informed response to the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission Final Report.\"\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission, the Department of the Premier and Cabinet established a \"YourSAy nuclear?\" website, advertising campaign and Citizens' Jury process. Managed by the New Democracy Foundation, the Citizens' Jury process randomly invited 25,000 South Australians to participate by post. Of those who accepted the invitation, a total of 350 jurors will be chosen to meet and discuss the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission's final report, help produce a simplified version for further discussion, and ultimately express their support or rejection of its various recommendations. South Australian company DemocracyCo won the contract to facilitate the first Citizens' Jury. DemocracyCo spokesperson Emily Jenke described the process and its result as \"one of the pieces the Premier and Government will be using to inform their thinking\".\n\nThe first Citizens' Jury was composed of 50 people. They were provided with the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission's final report and heard from a panel whose members are listed below.\nThe first Citizens Jury produced a report after hearing witnesses and deliberating over four sitting days. Its publication was followed by the launch of a statewide community consultation program coordinated by the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. The campaign carried the slogan \"Get to know nuclear. Discover. Discuss. Decide\" and included print, radio and television commercials, online discussions and community displays attended by DPC staff.\n\nA second jury was later formed, expanding the cohort of jurors to approximately 350 people.\n\nAfter hearing from a larger cohort of expert witnesses, the citizens' jury ultimately concluded, by a two-thirds majority vote, to not pursue to prospect of the importation of spent nuclear fuel to South Australia under any circumstances. A \"lack of trust\" was cited as a primary driver.\n\nThe prospect of constructing nuclear submarines in South Australia has been raised on various occasions during the 2010s.\n\nIn 2011, the CEO of Defence SA, Andrew Fletcher expressed his personal view that it would be unlikely for Australia's Future Submarine project to commit to producing nuclear powered submarines, unless a nuclear industry was established in Australia beforehand, or if their production was outsourced offshore. He expressed his belief that a commitment to 12 diesel-powered submarines was more likely.\n\nAuthors from UCL Australia have written opinion pieces and produced research papers on the topic. In 2016, the contract for the supply of Australia's Future Submarines Project was awarded to French company Direction des Constructions Navales Services (DCNS), and the Barracuda-class submarine was selected. The Barracuda-class submarine is currently a nuclear powered submarine, but the Australian Government has sought a modified design with diesel-powered pump jet propulsion. The other bidders which were competing for the tender do not make nuclear powered submarines. Australian Cabinet ministers have discussed the merits of keeping the nuclear propulsion option open by choosing the Barracuda-class design and the coalition government is supportive of nuclear industrial development in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, former Rolls Royce nuclear engineer and submarine expert Steve Ludlam was appointed to the Defence SA Advisory Board.\n\nin 2017, former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke of the merits of considering nuclear propulsion for Australia's Future Submarine Project, claiming various advantages over diesel propulsion, including range and speed.\nSupport for expanding the nuclear industry in South Australia has been expressed by corporate uranium mining interests Western Mining Corporation (the first owners of the Olympic Dam mine), BHP Billiton (their successors) and the Rio Tinto Group. Industry representative bodies have also expressed their support, including the Minerals Council of Australia and its predecessors, the Uranium Information Centre and the Australian Uranium Association. Other spokespeople supporting nuclear industrial development in South Australia include Richard Yeeles, Nigel McBride from Business SA and Jason Kuchel from the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy. Staff and students of UCL Australia have published research papers supporting the exploration of further nuclear industrial development in South Australia. Professor Stefaan Simons has advocated for the consideration of uranium enrichment and nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nIn March 2017, eleven members of the Turnbull Government were listed as openly supporting the prospect of nuclear power in Australia. Listed politicians were: Andrew Broad, James Paterson, Tony Pasin, Tim Wilson, Chris Back, Craig Kelly, Eric Abetz, Andrew Hastie, Warren Entsch, Bridget McKenzie and Rowan Ramsey.\n\nThere has been considerable Australian resistance to uranium mining for some decades. There have been concerns that uranium drives the global nuclear weapons cycle, disturbs or degrades sacred sites, releases carcinogenic radon gas, and contaminates groundwater. Nuclear power is considered by opponents as an unsafe, centralised, and secretive energy option, which creates security risks. High-level radioactive waste management has also been another major concern.\n\nOpponents to the expansion of nuclear industry in South Australia include the Australian Greens (whose spokespeople include Scott Ludlam and Mark Parnell), Friends of the Earth, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Conservation Council of South Australia. Opposition has also been expressed by Kevin Buzzacott, Eileen Kampakuta Brown, Eileen Wani Wingfield and other elders of several indigenous peoples. The Desert Liberation Front has coordinated protest events at the gates of the Olympic Dam mine in 2012 and 2016 using the names The Lizard's Revenge and The Lizard Bites Back.\n"}

Commissioned by Ogden Goelet, it was built at a cost of $4.5 million in 1892. It is the second largest mansion in Newport after nearby The Breakers. These two mansions, along with Belcourt Castle (the 3rd largest mansion) and Marble House, were designed by architect Richard Morris Hunt. It is owned by Salve Regina University.\n\nThe Goelets were an American dynasty that had grown from humble 18th century trade into vast 19th century investments. Ogden Goelet was a banker, real estate investor and competitive yachtsman. His wife, Mary Wilson Goelet, oversaw the operation of Ochre Court during a typical eight-week summer season. This usually required twenty-seven house servants, eight coachmen and grooms and twelve gardeners.\nRichard Morris Hunt designed Ochre Court, modelling the mansion on the chateaux of France's Loire Valley. The design is in the Louis XIII-style of architecture, with high roofs, turrets, tall chimneys and elaborate dormers. Elaborate decoration is seen inside and out in classical-style ceiling paintings, heraldry, carved emblems and statues, and a profusion of stained glass.\n\nThe Goelet's daughter, May, married Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe, taking with her an $8 million dowry. Their son, Robert, was a businessman with an interest in American railroads, hotels and real estate.

Karam received degrees from the American University of Beirut (AUB), Columbia University, and Harvard University. In his primary professional capacity, he is known as a specialist in the restructuring of organizations and distressed companies, most notably occupying the post of Financial Adviser to the Director General of UNESCO and serving as a Chairman and CEO of several major companies in Europe and the Middle East in various sectors, ranging from Industry to Real Estate development, Hotels, Trading and Financial Services.\n\nKaram was the lead principal in the restructuring and modernization of the Real Estate Bank of Syria, a State-owned bank, and the successful turn around of Lebanon's BLC Bank, one of the major commercial banks of Lebanon which had to be taken over by the Central Bank of Lebanon in 2002. He also played a key role in the modernization of the banking sector in Syria in general, its liberalization and its opening to international financial markets - an effort he was able to press further as CEO of Souria Holdings, the second largest investment company in the country and the first in Syria to implement the Public Private Partnership model. Some critics have argued, however, that despite the multiple efforts of Syrian, Lebanese and foreign institutions like the EU, the economic reforms introduced by President Bashar Al-Assad since his ascension as head of state in 2000 have had a far more limited impact than promised and may have even precipitated the unrest and protests that began in the Spring of 2011 and later developed into the Syrian Civil War.\n\nKaram was born on September 16, 1948, in Lebanon. Among other aspects of his career, he has taught Economics, Finance and Banking at several universities, such as Harvard University, The University of Southern Europe, and the Institut des Etudes Politiques – IEP. He is currently the Chairman of ASTRO Bank, Cyprus, formerly known as Piraeus Bank, He is also the Vice Chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce Lebanon national committee and sits on several boards of commercial and investment banks in Lebanon and Syria.\n\nPrior to this role, Karam served as the Special Adviser to H.E. the President of the Republic of Lebanon, Michel Suleiman for the duration of his six-year mandate and as Senior Adviser to Prime Minister Tammam Salam during the critical period of presidential vacancy in the country, 25 May 2014 to 31 October 2016. In this post, he launched a National Sustainable Development Strategy - acting as the national focal point for the Syrian refugee issue - and oversaw international relations for the Office of the Prime Minister. Karam also served as the Adviser to the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Economic Affairs of the Arab Republic of Syria, Mr. Abdullah Dardari, entrusted with driving the Public Private Partnership initiative in the country. Dardari is currently serving as the Senior Advisor on Reconstruction for the Middle East and North Africa at the World Bank.\n\nA patron of the arts and of his alma mater AUB, Karam is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Holy Spirit University Kaslik, the President of the Association Libanaise pour le Développement du Mécénat Culturel and holds several decorations, including the Grand Officer of the Spanish Order of Isabella the Catholic and an Officer of the Lebanese Order of the Cedar. Karam is married with three children, one girl and two boys.\n\nIn 2002, the Banque du Liban (BDL) took control of BLC after bad management pushed the BLC to the edge of bankruptcy. The prospects for a turnaround were widely thought to be grim, with the Central Bank expected to, at best, protect deposits. However, Riad Salameh, governor of the BDL, was determined to develop a plan to rebuild the bank and return it to profitability in Lebanon’s renowned and competitive banking sector. Accordingly, over the next three years he brought in a dynamic management team led by Karam, who already had a great deal of international experience having also worked for several years in the 1990s as a leading banker at Merrill Lynch. Karam was reportedly concerned about BLC’s fundamentals at first, telling the business magazine Executive: \"The bank had a very high negative net worth. The level of accumulated net losses was historic plus... there were dramatic structural problems.” In late 2005, after successfully implementing a plan developed by Karam and approved by Salameh, the BDL decided to sell BLC. Initial reports said that Salemeh was hoping for a $150 million price tag, but bidding began at $165 million. The highest offer, however, came in at $236.37 million for a 96% stake from the High Supreme Council for Qatari Economic Affairs and Investment, which later became known as the Qatar Investment Authority. Salameh recovered all of the central bank’s investments and made a substantial profit of $90 million.\n\nKaram has been described as a leading, un-traditional Lebanese banker not only because he has international work experience in the field of finance, but also because he is politically and financially independent - something that Karam argues \"protected [me] from being pressured or blackmailed by pressure groups and political parties, unlike other Lebanese bankers who are being criticized and attacked because of that fact.\" Although he was the subject of defamation campaigns, lawsuits and personal threats, he was able to avoid the pressure traditionally placed on business leaders in the country by politicians because Central Bank head Salameh allowed him complete autonomy in restructuring the troubled company.\n\nIn 2004, Karam led BLC bank to become the first bank in the country to provide micro credit loans to small businesses. The Spanish microfinance cooperation program provided 4 million Euros for the effort initially, which directly injected much needed liquidity “directly into the veins of the economy,” as Karam put it at the time. “[Since] the success of this initiative depends on providing cheap financing to the micro-enterprises, it is imperative for the lending institution (BLC) to source out funds at low rates. For this reason, the management of BLC turned to outside funding agencies as costs of funds outside Lebanon are currently cheaper than the local market,” explained the bank’s press release.\n\nIn 2008, Karam wrote a series of articles in the local and regional media laying out Lebanon's unsustainable debt situation (currently pegged at over 160% of debt to GDP) and recommending ways to deal with the looming crisis head on. \"It is recognized that the public debt,\" he wrote, \"is one of the most crucial problems that Lebanon faces today. More important than security considerations, it is susceptible, if mismanaged, to cause damage to the country's basic foundations far more lasting than burnt buildings and regrettable life loss. It is also likely to become itself a source of turbulence.\" Karam explained further that the country has been \"on the brink of disaster for several years and were it not for the steps taken by the governor of the central bank, today and in past years, little would have been done to avoid the collapse.\" Such steps, he argued, \"are cosmetic and their purpose is to avoid an immediate crisis and buy time for true reform and fundamental structural fiscal measures to be conceived and implemented. Financial engineering has never replaced sound policy.\"\n\nKaram decried the lack of care or concern evinced by \"political circles,\" asking, \"What better illustration of the adage that if you owe a little sum you lose sleep over it but if you owe millions, it is your banker who loses sleep over it. He also criticized his own industry, Lebanese banks, for being slow to reform themselves and to implement new Basel II regulations, a rare move by an insider for an insular sector.\n\nIn several op-eds later in the year, he called for a series of controversial structural reforms, saying that as a first matter, Lebanon \"needs to address the Treasury's financial priorities by starting to implement existing solutions to the problem of Electricite du Liban, thus tackling one of the main chunks of the budget deficit. Showing determination in this area will encourage the implementation of Paris III and maybe convince donors\" not only to deflect assistance from specific projects to direct and indirect unconditional budget support, but also to \"accelerate the pace of their payments.\" \n\nNoting that inter-Arab trade volumes are much more modest than they should be, Karam has argued that the reasons for this are \"principally the lack of extensive distribution networks, the absence of comprehensive trade agreements that go beyond the existing accords and the fact that transactions have to go through the US dollar.\" As such, Karam has become one of the leading voices in the Arab Middle East calling for a common currency. \"The pegging to the US dollar of most of the major currencies in the region will facilitate the technical engineering of the process,\" he says. \"This currency could be named the Umma, with reference to the unattainable dream of a unified Arab nation.\"\n\nAdmitting that there are some potential pitfalls, Karam nevertheless has challenged policymakers and financial analysts alike to \"imagine oil barrels partially priced in Umma. Imagine Arab and foreign tourists paying hotels and restaurant bills in one currency all over the Arab world... Imagine an Umma resting solidly on the foundation of a multi trillion economy fueled by three hundred million consumers. Finally, imagine the economic and political convergence this will inevitably generate. Imagine ... But, is it not the lack of imagination our worst endemic disease?\" \n\nIn 2007, Karam, urged the Syrian authorities to implement several measures to enhance the role of the central bank and improve the performance of commercial banks in the country, most notably via a lecture he delivered entitled “Issues and the Future of Syrian Banks” before an audience of prominent Syrian businessmen, bankers and politicians at the Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus. Karam stressed the need for the full independence of the central bank and its total control over exchange rate management, monetary policy and banking supervision to put a stop to the interference of the Ministry of Finance in the banking sector and the role of the Commercial Bank of Syria (CBOS) in exchange markets. Although most of these reforms were subsequently implemented, some critics argue that deeper reforms will be necessary if Syria is to emerge from the decades of state-owned, authoritarianism that has, in part, created long-term systemic risks for the country.\n\n"}

This 1991 report concluded, \"Contrary to the jobs-versus-owls rhetoric that blames environmental restrictions for layoffs, the movement toward an environmentally sustainable global economy will create far more jobs than it eliminates. The chief reason: non-polluting, environmentally sustainable industries tend to be intrinsically more labour intensive and less resource intensive than traditional processes.\" Among the features of sustainable industry offered in the paper were energy efficiency, resource conservation to meet the needs of future generations, safe and skill-enhancing working conditions, low waste production processes, and the use of safe and environmentally compatible materials. Some of the benefits, however would be offset by higher prices (due to labor costs) and a theoretically larger population needed to perform the same amount of work, increasing the agricultural and other loads on the system.\n\nIn February 2003 the business magazine Sustainable Industries was first published, offering news and analysis of core industries such as clean energy and green building. By 2012 the company had expanded to include digital media and event production with the Sustainable Industries Economic Forum in the U.S. Sustainable Industries merged with Triple Pundit in 2011.

{"id": "626654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=626654", "title": "TIAA Bank Field", "text": "TIAA Bank Field\n\nTIAA Bank Field is an American football stadium located in Jacksonville, Florida, that primarily serves as the home facility of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). The stadium opened in 1995 as Jacksonville Municipal Stadium on the site of the old Gator Bowl Stadium (erected 1927), and included some portions of the older stadium. Located on the St. Johns River, it sits on of land in downtown Jacksonville. \n\nIn addition to hosting the Jaguars, the stadium is also regularly used for college football, concerts, and other events. It is the regular site of the annual Florida–Georgia game, a college football rivalry game between the University of Florida and the University of Georgia. The stadium is also the home of the annual Gator Bowl, a post-season college bowl game. Additionally, the stadium hosted Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005 and is one of the venues used by the United States men's national soccer team. \n\nFrom 1997 to 2006, the stadium was named Alltel Stadium after communications company Alltel purchased naming rights. The facility was renamed EverBank Field in 2010, following the approval of a five-year, naming rights deal with the financial services company EverBank. The agreement was extended in 2014 for an additional 10 years. The Jaguars announced in February 2018 the stadium would be renamed TIAA Bank Field for the 2018 NFL season after EverBank was acquired by New York-based TIAA.\n\nTIAA Bank Field is located in the Stadium District of downtown Jacksonville, which has been home to football fields since the early 20th century. In 1928 the first permanent football stadium, Fairfield Stadium, was constructed. In 1948 this was expanded and renamed Gator Bowl Stadium, in honor of the annual Gator Bowl game first played two years earlier.\n\nThe current structure was built using a few portions of the historic Gator Bowl Stadium. However, all of the elements included from the older stadium — the pedestrian ramp system and the more recent West Upper Deck section of the complex — dated back only to 1982. Construction started January 3, 1994, and the new stadium opened on August 18, 1995, with an exhibition game with the St. Louis Rams. Total construction time was under 20 months and total cost was US$134 million – $60 million of which was provided by the city of Jacksonville.\n\nIn January 1993, representatives from the University of Florida and University of Georgia began negotiating with Jacksonville representatives to renew the contract to host the Florida–Georgia game, the annual rivalry game between the college football teams of the two universities. The universities' five-year contract with the Gator Bowl ended after the 1994 game, and the Citrus Bowl had offered Florida and Georgia a larger sum of money than the Gator Bowl for the right to host the game.\n\nTo counter the Citrus Bowl's larger monetary offer, Jacksonville mayor Ed Austin proposed a $25.5 million renovation plan to Jacksonville's aging Gator Bowl Stadium, which had been built in 1949. Both teams had expressed concerns about the condition of the aging stadium, and renovations were considered key to enticing the teams to keep returning to Jacksonville, bringing tens of millions of dollars in consumer spending with them. Despite the promise of renovations, Georgia athletic director Vince Dooley was unswayed, so Austin widened the scope of the renovations, increasing their price tag to $49 million, and traveled to Athens, Georgia, to talk with Dooley in person. Austin's campaigning was partially successful. On March 23, 1993, the two universities announced they had signed a five-year contract with the Gator Bowl, running from 1997 to 2002. The contract was contingent on Austin successfully passing the $49 million renovation bond issue through the Jacksonville City Council and the city completing the renovations by the 1996 game. On Tuesday, May 11, the Jacksonville City Council approved a $219.5 million bond issue, including the $49 million for the renovation of the Gator Bowl.\n\nSoon after the approval of the bond issue, investors interested in attracting a new National Football League team to Jacksonville requested that another $30 million be added to the $49 million renovations in order to make the stadium more attractive for a professional team. That number climbed higher throughout the summer, and eventually the city reached an agreement with the leading group of investors hoping to attract an NFL team to Jacksonville. On July 1, the city and investors reached a lease agreement contingent on the city investing $112.3 million for improving the Gator Bowl. The lease agreement later collapsed when the Jacksonville City Council voted to send the lease back to a committee for further study rather than approving it. One month after the proposed deal fell through, city officials and investors tried again and were successful in negotiating a deal that included a pledge to spend $121 million on renovations to the Gator Bowl. Due to the expanded renovations, it was announced that the 1994 Florida-Georgia game would have to be moved out of the Gator Bowl, as had the 1995 game, in order to provide time for the newly expanded renovation plan to be completed before 1996. In the end, the expanded bond issue and renovation program proved to be successful, as Jacksonville was awarded the 30th NFL franchise—the Jacksonville Jaguars—on November 30, 1993.\n\nAlmost as soon as the celebration surrounding Jacksonville's new NFL team died down, however, a renovation contractor's plan to give 8% of the stadium work to minority-owned businesses drew criticism. The NAACP and another group said African-American businesses should have been awarded twice that amount of work.\n\nThe stadium's re-opening day was also the home debut of the Jaguars during the 1995 NFL season. It was the first time that an expansion NFL team had played its first game in a new facility; they played the Houston Oilers in the opener and lost 10–3. The Gator Bowl returned as a New Year's Day bowl game on January 1, 1996, following the 1995 NCAA season.\n\nThe stadium contains 11,200 club seats, 88 luxury suites, and a \"super suite\".\n\nIn 1997, the stadium changed its name to Alltel Stadium after naming rights were acquired by Alltel, a telecommunications company best known as a wireless carrier. The name Alltel Stadium stopped being used by the city after January 2007 when the contract expired; by that point, most of Alltel's assets had been purchased by Verizon.\nIn 2005, the stadium hosted Super Bowl XXXIX in which the New England Patriots defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24–21 in front of 78,125, the largest Super Bowl in attendance since 1994. Paul McCartney performed at halftime, performing Beatles classics \"Drive My Car\", \"Get Back\", and \"Hey Jude\", as well as a firework-filled \"Live and Let Die\". In 2003 and 2004, $47 million in improvements to the stadium were implemented to prepare for the Super Bowl. These improvements included the addition of a unique sports bar in the south end zone called the \"Bud Zone\", a larger and wider video and scoring display from Daktronics, escalators in the north and south end zone, and a new \"terrace suite\" called the \"Sky Patio\" right above the \"Bud Zone\" in the south end zone.\nBefore the 2005 season, mainly due to low attendance figures and looming blackouts, team officials installed a series of tarps to reduce the seating capacity for Jaguars games. The covers were placed to block out seven sections in the upper north end zone and four in each upper deck section, located on the corners of each. This puts 9,703 seats out of service, leaving the stadium with 66,851 seats for the regular season. However, in the event the Jaguars make the AFC Championship Game, the stadium can easily be expanded to full capacity. Some believed that this was a sign that the city couldn't support an NFL team; the city is the second-smallest market in the league. However, the current capacity is actually very close to what Wayne Weaver included in his original proposal to bring the Gator Bowl up to NFL standards. The city council turned this plan down, mainly out of concern for not having enough seats to accommodate the annual Florida-Georgia game.\n\nDespite the changes, however, blackouts have still occurred, including two of their first three home games in 2007 and nine of ten games in 2009. It is believed that the 2008 US financial crisis played a major part in the 2009 season blackouts, leading to insufficient ticket sales, with only the final home engagement of the regular season, with the Indianapolis Colts, managing to sell out. However, the Jaguars' 2010 season saw a huge turnaround in ticket sales, with no games being blacked out that year. The Jaguars avoided blackouts in all games in 2011 and 2012.\n\nFor the Super Bowl, Florida–Georgia game, and occasionally the Gator Bowl, temporary bleachers are put up in the south end zone and the tarps are removed, raising capacity to over 84,000.\n\nThe attendance record was set on September 29, 2007, when 85,413 watched Florida State defeat Alabama in what was dubbed the River City Showdown. Each school received nearly 36,000 tickets, and the Gator Bowl Association added 5,800 seats.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, naming rights to the stadium were bought by EverBank, one of the nation's largest privately held bank holding companies with approximately $11.2 billion in assets. On August 10, the deal was officially approved by the Jacksonville City Council with a 14–3 vote.\nIn November 2013, Jacksonville's City Council approved $63 million in improvements to EverBank Field. Jaguars owner Shahid Khan helped finance $20 million of the cost. Renovations included two end zone video scoreboards 362-foot-long that are the largest HD LED of their kind in the world, a platform area in the north end zone with two wading pools, unique food and beverage offerings, interactive activities, and 55,000 square feet of HD video screens, which is a world record for a stadium. Construction of the platform resulted in the removal of approximately 7,000 seats, though temporary seating can be installed for major events that will require a larger stadium capacity. During the construction a live webcam was set up to view the progress of the new video scoreboards. The scoreboards were publicly unveiled on July 26, 2014.\n\nIn the middle of 2016, the Jaguars and the city of Jacksonville announced $90 million in improvements to the stadium. Phase 1 includes the improvements to club seating, sponsored by US Assure, new walkout patios at the 50-yard-line and the creation of a new south end zone tunnel that will be the new team entrance and create two new seating environments. Phase 2 includes the construction of an amphitheater (Daily's Place) and a covered flex field; both phases were completed in May 2017.\n\nAfter the successful 2017 season which saw the Jaguars return to the playoffs for the first time since the 2007 season and host a playoff game for the first time since 1999, the Jaguars announced the removal of last of the tarps on the upper levels. The removal adds 3,501 seats to the capacity of the stadium bringing total capacity to 67,814.\n\nThe seating capacity for Jaguars games has gone as followed:\n\n"}

It initially began in order to commercialize research which had been conducted at Stanford University's Department of Computer Science between 1999 and 2002. It was founded in Mountain View, California in January, 2003 by Christian Chabot, Pat Hanrahan and Chris Stolte, who specialized in visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes. Tableau products query relational databases, OLAP cubes, cloud databases, and spreadsheets and then generates a number of graph types. The products can also extract data and store and retrieve from its in-memory data engine.\n\nTableau has a mapping functionality, and is able to plot latitude and longitude coordinates and connect to spatial files like Esri Shapefiles, KML, and GeoJSON to display custom geography. The built-in geocoding allows for administrative places (country, state/province, county/district), postal codes, US Congressional Districts, US CBSA/MSA, Area Codes, Airports, and European Union statistical areas (NUTS codes) to be mapped automatically. You can group geographies to create custom territories or use custom geocoding to extend existing geographic roles in the product. There are five ways to access their products: Desktop (both professional and personal editions), Server, Online (which scales to support thousands of users), Reader, and Public, with the last two free to use. Vizable, a consumer data visualization mobile app, was released in 2015. A sixth product known as Data Prep, for data preparation workflows, was released in May 2018.\n\nIn June 2018, Tableau acquired Empirical Systems, a Cambridge, Massachusetts based artificial intelligence startup, with plans to integrate the company's technology into the Tableau platform. Tableau also announced plans to establish an office in Cambridge as a result of the deal.\n\nThe use of Tableau in data-driven companies is to produce data reports to reflect the operation conditions in real time.\n\nOn May 17, 2013, Tableau launched an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, raising more than $250 million. Prior to its IPO, Tableau raised over $45 million in venture capital investment from investors such as the NEA and Meritech.\n\nThe company's 2013 revenue reached $232.44 million, an 82% growth over 2012's $128 million. In 2010, Tableau reported revenue of $34.2 million. That figure grew to $62.4 million in 2011 and $127.7 million in 2012. Profit during the same periods came to $2.7 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively. The founders moved the company to Seattle, Washington in 2004, where it remains headquartered today. In August 2016, Tableau announced the appointment of Adam Selipsky as president and CEO, effective September 16, 2016, replacing co-founder Christian Chabot as CEO.\n\nOn December 2, 2010, Tableau deleted WikiLeaks's visualizations about the United States diplomatic cables leak, stating it was due directly to political pressure from US Senator Joe Lieberman.\n\nOn February 21, 2011, Tableau posted an updated data policy. The accompanying blog post cited the two main changes as (1) creating a formal complaint process and (2) using freedom of speech as a guiding principle. In addition, the post announced the creation of an advisory board to help the company navigate future situations that \"push the boundaries\" of the policy. Tableau likened the new policy to the model set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and opined that under the new policy, Wikileaks' visuals would not have been removed, as \"the underlying data were statistics \"about\" the cables, not the cables themselves\".\n\nIn 2008, Tableau was named a Codie award winner for \"Best Business Intelligence Solution\" by the Software and Information Industry Association. The company was recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for five consecutive years between 2012 and 2017.\n"}

{"id": "10100182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10100182", "title": "Winter Kills (film)", "text": "Winter Kills (film)\n\nWinter Kills is a 1979 American black comedy film directed by William Richert, based on the novel by satirist Richard Condon. A black comedy fictionalising the assassination conspiracy of President John F. Kennedy, its all-star cast includes Jeff Bridges, John Huston, Anthony Perkins, Eli Wallach, Richard Boone, Toshirō Mifune, Sterling Hayden, Dorothy Malone, Belinda Bauer, Ralph Meeker, Elizabeth Taylor, Berry Berenson and Susan Walden.\n\nThe film simplifies the plot of the book somewhat, emphasizing humor. It follows the events surrounding the assassination of President Kegan (patterned after John F. Kennedy). Several years later, Kegan's half-brother Nick (Bridges) discovers leads which suggest there may have been a plot to kill the President.\n\nMost of the film was photographed by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, and the production designer was Robert F. Boyle, who cited the film as one of his favorites. Although \"Winter Kills\" was a box office bomb, it has since become a cult classic.\n\nSet in the contemporary 1979 but in a different reality, Nick Kegan (Jeff Bridges) is on board his millionaire father's tanker ship when he phones his lover, Yvette Malone (Belinda Bauer), who lives in New York City and leaves a message on her answering machine just to hear her soft and seductive voice. Just then, a family associate named Keifetz (Richard Boone) arrives on the ship by helicopter with an injured man whose face is wrapped in bandages. Inside a doctor's office, the injured man, Arthur Fletcher (Joe Spinell), mutters a confession as an orderly transcribes; Fletcher had assassinated Nick's half-brother, the President of the United States, 19 years earlier on February 22, 1960. Fletcher claims that he and another gunman were hired by a man named Casper, Jr., for the job, after which Fletcher hid his rifle in Room 903 of the Engleson Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where the assassination happened as the President was riding in an open limousine beside Philadelphia's City Hall building. Fletcher confesses to the killing because he claims that he wants to be able to prove that he was the real killer. Nick inquires about Willie Arnold, the assassin who was determined to be the lone gunman by the Pickering Commission. However, Fletcher dies before he can answer, so Nick heads to Philadelphia to look for the rifle.\n\nAt the Engleson Building, Nick uncovers the weapon, but, just as he and his companions prepare to leave, a young woman on a bicycle (Barbara Richert) rides past their vehicle and pops her chewing gum. In an instant, Nick's associates are shot dead by an unseen sniper. Panicked, Nick runs to call his father, Pa Kegan (John Huston), but instead is connected to John Cerruti (Anthony Perkins), the mastermind behind the Kegan empire. When Nick reports the incident and his whereabouts, Cerruti promises to send help, but the vehicle and the rifle inside are stolen by an unseen person as Nick waits.\n\nSometime later, Nick is chauffeured to Pa Kegan's desert estate in California, where he is greeted by the Japanese butler, Keith (Toshirô Mifune). Later that evening, Nick sees his emotionally unstable mother, Emma (Dorothy Malone), and is rebuked by his father for leaving the ship. When Nick reports Fletcher's confession and the incident in Philadelphia, his father storms away. However, Pa wakes Nick in the morning with a plan to expose the assassination conspiracy.\n\nSometime later, Pa sends Nick to meet his former political rival and one of the richest men in the U.S., Z.K. Dawson (Sterling Hayden). Driving into Dawson's Tulsa, Oklahoma, ranch, Nick is cornered by WW II tanks. Dawson surfaces from a hatch, arguing that he was not involved with the assassination and implicating the Philadelphia Police Departments Captain Heller and his sidekick, Ray Doty.\n\nOn an airplane to New York City, Nick receives a call from Pa, who reports that they no longer have witnesses to Fletcher's confession; Keifetz was killed and the ship's orderly broke his neck in a fall. Sometime later, Nick meets Doty, who remembers that the man implicated in Fletcher's confession, Casper, Jr., was connected to the Philadelphia police through a nightclub owner named Joe Diamond (Eli Wallach) who murdered Willie Arnold two days after the assassination. According to Doty (in a long flashback sequence to the 1950s), Diamond bribed Captain Heller (Brad Dexter) for access into the police station so he could kill Willie Arnold after the presidential assassination. Gangster Gameboy Baker (Ralph Meeker) arranged the assassination because the president did not return favors for the mafia's $2 million campaign contribution and Arnold was their scapegoat. Diamond died in prison four years after the assassination and the killing of Willie Arnold\n\nSometime after his meeting with Doty, Nick returns to New York City and makes love to Yvette. In the throes of passion, the young woman agrees to marry him but later retracts her promise, claiming that Nick is more intimate with her answering machine. When Nick returns home to his apartment, he is attacked by his maid, but he gains the upper hand and has her arrested.\n\nAt lunch the next day at a fancy restaurant, Nick asks Yvette to help him track down information about Joe Diamond through National Magazine, the magazine for which she works. Soon, Yvette directs Nick to a Cleveland, Ohio, diner, where he meets gangster Irving Mentor (Irving Selbst) and bribes him for information. Mentor reports that Casper, Jr., figured in the assassination because he was connected to a Hollywood studio that lost $50 million when one of their stars killed herself over an affair with the president. Just then, the same woman on the bicycle who popped her chewing gum before the shootings in Philadelphia brings a dead cat into Mentor's diner and Nick chases after her as the restaurant explodes from a bomb. The unknown woman again gets away.\n\nNick returns to New York City, where Pa debunks Mentor's story and orders Nick to meet with imprisoned gangster Frank Mayo (Tomas Milian), who was given special leave for the interview. When Mayo suggests that Nick is being misled, Nick heads to National Magazine headquarters and learns that Yvette is not actually an employee. Later, the hostile doorman at Yvette's apartment insists that she does not live there.\n\nReturning home, Nick finds Keifetz, who admits that he faked his death and encourages Nick to use Cerruti's intelligence connections to find Yvette. At Pa's financial headquarters, Cerutti tells Nick that Yvette was kidnapped by Casper Jr., and recounts a new version of the assassination. According to Cerruti (in another flashback sequence to 1959), a Washington, D.C. madam named Lola Comante (Elizabeth Taylor), who obliged the president's fondness for sex, offered him a $2 million campaign contribution from Mayo and his mafia associates. When the president discovered that Pa was behind the deal, he ended their relationship, leaving Pa financially and emotionally devastated.\n\nChanging the story yet again, Cerruti confesses that he arranged for Nick to meet a fraudulent Z.K. Dawson in Tulsa. The real Dawson and his daughter, Yvette, were the true perpetrators of the assassination; Yvette, formerly known as Maggie Dawson, was the president's mistress. Nick discounts Cerruti's story and insists on learning Yvette's whereabouts. As Nick assaults and fractures Cerruti's arms with a baton, he breaks down. Cerutti claims that Pa spent millions of dollars to support his son's presidency because it benefited him financially, but he was displeased by the president's liberal politics and so it was Pa who had him killed. Pa created an elaborate hoax to confuse Nick, including the employment of an actress named Jenny O'Brien to play the role of Yvette. When Cerruti says that Jenny is \"tied up\" at Kegan Medical School, Nick leaves... only to find her body in the morgue.\n\nSometime later, Nick confronts his father in his office, but Pa claims that Cerruti masterminded the assassination to augment the Kegan coffers and blackmailed Pa into keeping quiet. When Nick attempts to call the police, Keifetz and an officer break into Pa's office and Nick thinks the men are there to back him up; however, Pa announces that Keifetz is an assassin with orders to kill Nick. Defending himself, Nick grabs the officer and uses his gun to fire at Keifetz, who shoots back at the officer as he dies. Nick chases his father onto the high-rise balcony and finds Pa clinging to the rail of an enormous American flag. As Nick reaches for his father, Pa falls to his death, tearing the flag in half with his body as he calls out to Nick: \"put my money in South America!\". Nick staggers away, but tells the secretary that he will return because he cannot escape his family ties. (In some versions after Pa Kegan's death, Nick has a final encounter with the mystery woman riding on a bicycle, with a young child riding in a child's seat, in a park outside the Kegan Building, waving at him before she rides away; the woman's identity is never revealed).\n\nSometime later in the final scene, Nick calls Yvette's answering machine to hear her voice one last time.\n\n\nThe film original producers were wealthy marijuana dealers Robert Sterling and Leonard Goldberg, who had previously worked on releasing the French softcore Emmanuelle films in the U.S. Many of the film's interior scenes were shot in 1977 at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, then home to the American Film Institute's film school. The production went so far over budget that it was shut down three times, having declared bankruptcy. Goldberg was murdered (most likely by the Mafia) in the middle of production, for failure to pay his debts, and Sterling was later sentenced to 40 years in prison for marijuana smuggling.\n\nRichert and \"Winter Kills\" stars Bridges and Bauer went to Germany and filmed a comedy called \"The American Success Company\" (released in 1980), whose distribution rights made enough money for Richert to fund a resumption of \"Winter Kills\" two years later. All the same, the film's distributor, Embassy Pictures controlled the final cut.\n\nA few years later, Richert acquired the rights to the film and re-released a director's cut, with a new ending, in 1983.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of 10 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7 out of 10. Many reviewers pointed out that the film existed on the boundary of a comedy and a thriller. \n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" compared the film to \"M*A*S*H\" and \"Dr. Strangelove\", writing, \"'Winter Kills' isn't exactly a comedy, but it's funny. And it isn't exactly serious, but it takes on the serious business of the Kennedy assassination.\" The \"Times\"' Vincent Canby also praised the film, complimenting writer/director William Richert's imagination. On the other hand, \"Variety\" magazine wrote of the film, \"If there’s a decent film lurking somewhere in \"Winter Kills\", writer-director William Richert doesn’t want anyone to see it in his Byzantine version of a presidential assassination conspiracy.\"\n\nInfluential publications, including \"Newsweek\" and \"The New Yorker\", also gave the film positive reviews, but it made little money when released (barely over $1 million on a $6.5 million budget). Distributor Embassy Pictures pulled the film from theaters soon after it was released; Condon and Richert hypothesized that Embassy killed it deliberately in order to avoid threatening legal defense contracts elsewhere within the conglomerate.\n\nThe 1983 re-release (and distribution to video) included scenes not originally shown on screen, including the original ending, and with additional footage of Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n\"Who Killed 'Winter Kills'?\" is a 2003, 38-minute documentary film, directed by Perry Martin and distributed by Anchor Bay, about the production of the film.\n\n"}
