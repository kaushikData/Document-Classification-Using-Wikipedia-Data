She in the process of launching the first sugar factory in Northern Uganda. Atiak sugar factory will not only bring revenue and development for the region but is championed as the first large scale industrial project for Northern Uganda. She is also one of the city's largest distributors of cement and other hardware materials. With successful business ventures throughout Uganda she has become a beacon of hope and a motivating role model for young African girls.\n\nAmina was born in Bungoma in the west of Kenya, where her mother, Sarah Hersi Ali, is a prominent businesswoman. Adam Hersi Ali, her uncle, who was another inspirational pillar in Amina's life, served as a Financial Secretary of Treasury in the Kenya's Ministry of Finance in the late 1980s. As a young girl, Moghe and her sister regularly joined their family in the cross border trade between Kenya and Uganda.The two girls were sent to accounting school by their mother, where they built on their entrepreneurial skills. Having a strong entrepreneurial mother led her to be business savvy not afraid of making big business risks. Her biggest risk was closing her successful hardware store in Bungoma Kenya and venturing in a start up business in Uganda after the stabilisation of the country in 1996. With no foundation set for her she used the skills she was taught to set up a hardware store in the bustling city of Kampala Uganda. This stride into the unknown was the first step of the enterprising woman she is today.\n\nMoghe quickly adapted to her new environment and acted as a convenient link on the ground for her family's commercial trade. She began expanding the family business and entered the real estate sector. Moghe would eventually become one of the wealthiest people in Uganda and come to own the Oasis Centre, a multimillion-dollar shopping mall complex and grand scale luxurious apartment Laburnam Courts that are both situated in the center of the capital.

{"id": "998103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=998103", "title": "Bioequivalence", "text": "Bioequivalence\n\nBioequivalence is a term in pharmacokinetics used to assess the expected in vivo biological equivalence of two proprietary preparations of a drug. If two products are said to be bioequivalent it means that they would be expected to be, for all intents and purposes, the same.\n\nBirkett (2003) defined bioequivalence by stating that, \"two pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent and their bioavailabilities (rate and extent of availability) after administration in the same molar dose are similar to such a degree that their effects, with respect to both efficacy and safety, can be expected to be essentially the same. Pharmaceutical equivalence implies the same amount of the same active substance(s), in the same dosage form, for the same route of administration and meeting the same or comparable standards.\"\n\nFor The World Health Organization (WHO) \"two pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent or pharmaceutical alternatives, and their bioavailabilities, in terms of rate (Cmax and tmax) and extent of absorption (area under the curve), after administration of the same molar dose under the same conditions, are similar to such a degree that their effects can be expected to be essentially the same\" .\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has defined bioequivalence as, \"the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study.\"\n\nIn determining bioequivalence, for example, between two products such as a commercially available Brand product and a potential to-be-marketed Generic product, pharmacokinetic studies are conducted whereby each of the preparations are administered in a cross-over study to volunteer subjects, generally healthy individuals but occasionally in patients. Serum/plasma samples are obtained at regular intervals and assayed for parent drug (or occasionally metabolite) concentration. Occasionally, blood concentration levels are neither feasible or possible to compare the two products (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids), then pharmacodynamic endpoints rather than pharmacokinetic endpoints (see below) are used for comparison. For a pharmacokinetic comparison, the plasma concentration data are used to assess key pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve (AUC), peak concentration (\"C\"), time to peak concentration (\"T\"), and absorption lag time (\"t\"). Testing should be conducted at several different doses, especially when the drug displays non-linear pharmacokinetics.\n\nIn addition to data from bioequivalence studies, other data may need to be submitted to meet regulatory requirements for bioequivalence. Such evidence may include:\n\n\nThe World Health Organization considers two formulation bioequivalent if the 90% confidence interval for the ratio multisource (generic) product/comparator lie within 80.00-125.00% acceptance range for AUC and C. For high variable finished pharmaceutical products, the applicable acceptance range for C can be 69.84-143.19% .\n\nIn Australia, the Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) considers preparations to be bioequivalent if the 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) of the rate ratios, between the two preparations, of \"C\" and AUC lie in the range 0.80–1.25. \"T\" should also be similar between the products.\n\nThere are tighter requirements for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index and/or saturable metabolism – thus no generic products exist on the Australian market for digoxin or phenytoin for instance.\n\nAccording to regulations applicable in the European Economic Area two medicinal products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent or pharmaceutical alternatives and if their bioavailabilities after administration in the same molar dose are similar to such a degree that their effects, with respect to both efficacy and safety, will be essentially the same. This is considered demonstrated if the 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) of the ratios for AUC and \"C\" between the two preparations lie in the range 80–125%.\n\nThe FDA considers two products bioequivalent if the 90% CI of the relative mean C, AUC and AUC of the test (e.g. generic formulation) to reference (e.g. innovator brand formulation) should be within 80% to 125% in the fasting state. Although there are a few exceptions, generally a bioequivalent comparison of Test to Reference formulations also requires administration after an appropriate meal at a specified time before taking the drug, a so-called \"fed\" or \"food-effect\" study. A food-effect study requires the same statistical evaluation as the fasting study, described above.\n\nWhile the FDA maintains that approved generic drugs are equivalent to their branded counterparts, bioequivalence problems have been reported by physicians and patients for many drugs. Certain classes of drugs are suspected to be particularly problematic because of their chemistry. Some of these include chiral drugs, poorly absorbed drugs, and cytotoxic drugs. In addition, complex delivery mechanisms can cause bioequivalence variances. Physicians are cautioned to avoid switching patients from branded to generic, or between different generic manufacturers, when prescribing anti-epileptic drugs, warfarin, and levothyroxine.\n\nMajor issues were raised in the verification of bioequivalence when multiple generic versions of FDA-approved generic drug were found not to be equivalent in efficacy and side effect profiles. In 2007, two providers of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements, ConsumerLab.com and The People's Pharmacy, released the results of comparative tests of different brands of bupropion. The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that some generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg didn't perform the same as the brand-name pill in laboratory tests. The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that the generic version is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL. After several years of denying patient reports, in 2012 the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that \"Budeprion XL 300 mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.\" The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. As of October 2013, the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent.\n\nIn 2004, Ranbaxy was revealed to have been falsifying data regarding the generic drugs they were manufacturing. As a result, 30 products were removed from US markets and Ranbaxy paid $500 million in fines. The FDA investigated many Indian drug manufacturers after this was discovered, and as a result at least 12 companies have been banned from shipping drugs to the US.\n\n\n"}

The US was the world's third-largest producer of cement, after China and India. The US cement industry includes 99 cement mills in 34 states, plus two plants in Puerto Rico. The industry directly employed 10,000 workers in 2015. Ten percent of the cement used in the United States in 2015 was imported.\n\nThe types and amounts of cement produced in 2015 were:\n\nCement production is predominantly portland cement, which is mostly used in concrete. Cement for concrete is an essential material for construction, and demand is a function of construction spending. Single-family residential construction is considered only moderately cement-intensive; multifamily residential somewhat more intensive. Nonresidential construction and government construction projects are considered the most cement-intensive.\n\nIn 2013, 70.8 percent of portland cement was sold as ready-mix concrete, such as is delivered in cement-mixer trucks. 11.5 percent was sold dry to contractors and construction materials stores; 11.3 percent was sold to manufacturers of concrete products; 4.6 percent was sold for oil and gas wells, and 1.8 percent was sold to government agencies and others.\n\nBecause cement is a bulk commodity, transportation can be a significant part of the cost. To minimize transportation costs, cement plants are ideally located close to the market, with access to efficient transportation such as ship or railroad. Most cement plants are located close to the limestone deposits.\n\nThirty-four states have cement manufacturing plants. In 2013, the five leading cement-producing states, in descending order, were: Texas, California, Missouri, Florida, and Alabama. Together, the five accounted for almost half of US cement production. The list of top five cement-consuming states is similar: Texas, California, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2015, about 10 percent of US cement consumption came from imports. The largest sources of US cement imports were Canada and Greece.\n\nIn 2013, the top producers of portland cement in the US were:\n\n\nIn 2013, the top 5 companies produced 54 percent of US portland cement; the top 10 companies produced 78 percent.\n\nPortland cement is a complex mixture, mostly calcium, with admixtures of aluminium, silica, and iron. The choice of source materials depends on local availability. The calcium is usually supplied by limestone, but sometimes shell or coral. Slightly clayey limestones are preferable, because they already contain the necessary aluminium. Cement cannot contain more than 5 percent magnesium, so the limestone must be low in magnesium.\n\nRaw materials used in US cement production, 2013 \nEnergy sources used in the US to manufacture cement in 2013 were:\n\nThe cement industry has both positive and negative effects on the environment.\n\nCement manufacture is a source of the following airborne contaminants: particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.\n\nCement production releases carbon dioxide by sintering limestone or shells. It is also very energy-intensive, with the result that the cement industry is a large emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe high temperatures of cement kilns, the ability of concrete to incorporate different materials, and the stable and nonreactive nature of the concrete end product, all make cement kilns a desirable method for the destruction of hazardous waste. \n\nHazardous wastes efficiently destroyed by cement kilns include chlorinated solvents (methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, trichloromethane, trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride), Freon-113, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin, waste oil, and used hydrocarbon solvents. Whatever undesirable materials are not destroyed are locked in the finished concrete, a stable material with low permeability. Hydrocarbon waste and used tires contribute to the kiln heat, and reduces fuel use. \n\nIn addition to destruction of hazardous waste, waste materials from other industries, such as slag and fly ash, are commonly incorporated into cement, eliminating the need to landfill the waste. The ability of cement to incorporate different materials allows contaminated soil to be added to the feed, eliminating the need to take the material to a hazardous waste landfill. The US EPA estimated that in 2014, 13.1 million tons of coal fly ash, which otherwise would have to be landfilled, was beneficially used in cement. In addition, the use of fly ash improves the strength and durability of concrete\n"}

Although the term is not consistently defined, generally speaking the term encompasses all executive officials and their staffs, civil servants, police, judicial officials, and members of the armed forces. While the term is used in other Commonwealth countries such as Canada, it has the most predominant use and is the most well-defined with the United Kingdom.\n\nThe terms civil servant and Crown servant can coincide but are sometimes exclusive.

Historic Downtown can be further broken down into the neighborhoods of Harsimus Cove, The Village, Van Vorst Park, Grove Street, Hamilton Park and Boyle Plaza. The Waterfront includes the Powerhouse Arts District/WALDO, Newport, the Harborside Financial Center and Paulus Hook (including Exchange Place). Historic Downtown is the area west of Marin Boulevard, while the Waterfront lies to the east.\n\nHistoric Downtown was an area of mostly low-rise buildings to the west of the waterfront—but that is rapidly changing. It includes the neighborhoods of Van Vorst Park and Hamilton Park, which are square parks surrounded by brownstones. The Grove Street neighborhood has also seen a lot of development and the neighborhood is rich with stores and restaurants that cater to the diverse backgrounds of Jersey City's inhabitants. The Grove Street PATH station is in the process of being rebuilt and a number of new housing is being built around the stop. Historic Downtown is home to many cultural attractions including the Jersey City Museum, the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse (planned to become a museum and artist housing) and the Harsimus Stem Embankment along Sixth Street, which a citizens' movement is working to turn into public parkland.\n\nLike Historic Downtown, the Waterfront of Jersey City is an area rich in history and full of current development. It is the location of the end of the Morris Canal and there is still a segment of this basin surrounded by Liberty State Park. The giant Colgate Clock, next to the Goldman Sachs Tower reminds people of the industry that used to line the Hudson River on New Jersey's Coast. Many of the names of Jersey City's downtown neighborhoods come from Dutch words or Dutch names from the early inhabitants along the Hudson. Paulus Hook is a quiet mostly residential neighborhood stretching to the west from the Goldman Sachs building. Its main streets are Essex and Morris Streets and its waterfront is along the Morris Canal, where it maintains a walkway which is part of Jersey City's longer waterfront walkway. The Essex Street station on the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and the development of office buildings to the east have allowed more businesses to line Morris Street including a number of restaurants with outdoor seating. The Paulus Hook and Grove Street neighborhoods, unlike many other redeveloped neighborhoods on the Hudson have undergone the same revitalization with less gentrification. The Newport/Pavonia, Harborside Financial Center and Exchange Place neighborhoods on the waterfront are experiencing significant construction of high-rise towers and with the addition of the Light Rail and more ferry service the area has become a growing destination for businesses, residents and tourists. WALDO (work and live district overlay) is an area that is being redeveloped from its days as a warehouse center to an artist community. It is already home to several galleries and restaurants and development of artist housing, more galleries, a museum and stores are being planned. The former Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse is the building that anchors this neighborhood and when it is renovated it will maintain its shell that so many locals are used to seeing. A Trump Plaza is currently being constructed on the property to the south of the Powerhouse. In January 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration gave navigational clearance for construction of a residential and commercial tower planned by the Chinese Overseas America Corporation, which would succeed the Goldman Sachs Tower as the tallest skyscraper in New Jersey.\n\n"}
{"id": "16662175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16662175", "title": "Downtown Tulsa", "text": "Downtown Tulsa\n\nDowntown Tulsa is an area of approximately surrounded by an inner-dispersal loop created by Interstate 244, Highway 64, and Highway 75. The area serves as Tulsa's financial and business district, and is the focus of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture. Much of Tulsa's convention space is located in downtown, such as the Tulsa Performing Arts Center and the Tulsa Convention Center, and the BOK Center. Prominent downtown sub-districts include the Blue Dome District, the Brady Arts district, and the Greenwood Historical District, Owen Park Historical Neighborhood, the site of ONEOK Field, a baseball stadium for the Tulsa Drillers opened in 2010.\n\nIn 2010, the estimated population of downtown is 4,000. The daytime population is estimated to be 36,000.\n\nTulsa includes many structures built during the Oil Boom in the 1920s and 1930s, including Art Deco buildings such as the Mid-Continent Tower, Boston Avenue Methodist Church, and the Exchange Bank Building (today known as the 320 South Boston Building). Oilman Waite Phillips, left a significant architectural impact on downtown Tulsa through the Philtower and Philcade buildings. Other notable Tulsa buildings include the Atlas Life Building, Holy Family Cathedral, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, and the Mayo Hotel, the former of which once served as home to J. Paul Getty. Known for a time as \"Terra Cotta City\", Tulsa hosted the International Sixth Congress on Art Deco in 2001.\n\nDowntown Tulsa is in the northwest quadrant of the city and is ringed by an expressway system called the inner dispersal loop. Downtown's buildings include many large office towers. At , the BOK Tower (formerly One Williams Center) was the tallest building in any of the 5 \"plains states\" (Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota) until the Devon Tower in Oklahoma City was completed in 2012. The BOK Tower was designed in 1975 by Minoru Yamasaki & Associates, the same architect who designed the World Trade Center in New York City.\n\nThe Tulsa Performing Arts Center occupies a half city block in Tulsa's historical downtown. The PAC is also the design of Minoru Yamasaki. It houses five theatres and a reception hall. More than a quarter of a million people visit the Center each year to attend a performance from one of Tulsa's seven acclaimed musical and dramatic companies including the Tulsa Ballet, Tulsa Symphony Orchestra, Tulsa Opera, and a variety of symphonic groups. The PAC hosts a multitude of cultural events through the fall, winter and spring.\nIn 2005 the City of Tulsa broke ground on a 19,199 seat regional events center designed by architect César Pelli. The arena was named the BOK Center (or Bank of Oklahoma Center) and opened on August 30, 2008.\nAnother popular downtown entertainment district is the Blue Dome, named for a distinctive, domed building at Second Street and Elgin Avenue, in the area in the eastern section of downtown. The building was originally constructed in 1924 as a Gulf Oil service station. It has been converted to an information desk/office for the district, and is about two blocks south of the OneOK field.\n\nThe Blue Dome District is known for its local dining options, large art festival, and scenic Downtown Tulsa views. Every May, the Blue Dome Arts Festival allows families to enjoy local music and street vendors surrounding the historic dome. Further, there is no bad angle for pictures of Tulsa's infamous skyline in this district. With so many delicious restaurants and walkable views, it is no wonder that the Blue Dome District continues to bring its unique art scene to Tulsa. \n\nTulsa boasts one of the nation’s most extensive collections of Art Deco architecture, which is most visible in the downtown Deco District. This region spans the area from 1st to 8th street, with borders at Boston and Cheyenne. This area is located in the heart of the skyscrapers of Downtown Tulsa and thus has many food, beverage, and fitness options readily available. The Bartlett Square at 5th and Main provides a unique European feel to this region, but the entire area is overflowing with Tulsa charm. \n\nThe Philtower and Philcade buildings, the Atlas Life building, Tulsa Club, and Public Service Company of Oklahoma building are some of the most prominent displays of the Art Deco architecture style in Tulsa. Many tours of this region are readily available. Perhaps one of the more interesting facts about the Art Deco region are the underground tunnels which connect many of the classic buildings. They are now open for public tours, providing interested guests with a one of a kind Tulsa experience. Beyond the extensive variety of local shops and restaurants, this district annually hosts one of the largest festivals in Tulsa: Mayfest. Every May, the Deco District comes alive during Mayfest, where artists, vendors, and live musicians combine to create one of the largest street festivals in Tulsa.\n\nEast Village comprises 115 acres bordered by East 2nd and East 7th Streets, Detroit Avenue and Lansing Avenue, just inside the inner-dispersal loop. This area boasts an upscale martini bar, a hair salon, a pet day care, photography studios, lofts, a knitting room and living arts district, among others. The cornerstone of this neighborhood is the fifth largest LGBT community center in the United States, the Dennis R. Neill Equality Center, owned and operated by Oklahomans for Equality/OkEq (formerly Tulsa Oklahomans for Human Rights/TOHR), with further development being planned for more restaurants, residential lofts and retail.\n\nThe development in the East Village has provided Tulsans and visitors with many food and entertainment opportunities. With areas like the Bond Center for large events intertwined with luxurious apartment complexes, the feeling of community is particularly strong within this area. The Boxyard- a shopping complex made from repurposed shipping containers- has quickly become a popular destination for local shopping and eating within the East Village. The annual MOJO music fest occurs in this region, mixing live music with local craft beers and food trucks. Regardless of interest, the East Village District has something for everyone in Downtown Tulsa.\n\nThe Greenwood Historical District is just north of downtown and east of the Brady District. It was once one of the most affluent African-American communities in the United States and referred to as Black Wall Street. In 1921, thirty-five blocks of businesses and residences were burned in this district during the infamous Tulsa Race Riot, the bloodiest racial riot in the history of the United States. The Oklahoma Legislature passed laws in 2001 aimed at revitalizing Greenwood, setting up a scholarship fund for college-bound descendants of riot victims and appropriating $2 million for a riot memorial. As of 2004, two blocks of the old neighborhood have been restored and are part of the Greenwood Historical District. It is now home to the Greenwood Cultural Center, the Tulsa Race Riot Memorial, and the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame, as well as Oklahoma State University - Tulsa and Langston University-Tulsa.\n\nBecause of its rich history, the Greenwood Historical District provides visitors with one of the most unique cultural experiences in Tulsa. The John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park details the relationship between African-Americans and the state of Oklahoma throughout history with an emphasis on the Tulsa Race Riot. The Mabel B Little Heritage House takes visitors back to the 1920s with its classic furnishings and information about the Riots. The Greenwood Cultural Center strives to educate on the unique history of the Greenwood District, with a focus on jazz and the blues as well. Alongside these important landmarks in the Greenwood District lies a growing retail district bordering OneOK Field on the east. With an ever-increasing number of food and dessert options in the region, Greenwood Historical District is a great stop to learn about Tulsa's history and refuel. \n\nFormerly known as the Brady Arts District, the Tulsa Art District is located north across the Sante Fe Railroad tracks from the central business district and centered at Main Street & Brady Avenue. The Brady District is one of Tulsa's oldest areas, characterized by two-story brick warehouses.\n\nThe Brady Theater, built between 1912 and 1914, was originally designed to serve as the city's municipal auditorium and was simply called \"Convention Hall\" for the first forty years of its life and was one of three internment camps where African Americans were detained after the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot. In 1952, major additions were added and the building was renamed Tulsa Municipal Theater. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Supplanted as the city auditorium in 1979 by construction of the Performing Arts Center in downtown, \"the Old Lady on Brady\" continues to be used today for a wide variety of concerts and theatrical productions.\n\nNorth of the Brady on Main Street is the Cain's Ballroom, formerly the garage of the Brady family and the home of Bob Wills and his band, the Texas Playboys. The district is also the location of many local artists' galleries, restaurants with late night hours, bars and dance clubs. It is also an emerging gay neighborhood, with several gay or gay-friendly bars and numerous supportive shops and restaurants.\n\nA few blocks southeast of Cain's Ballroom lies one of the gems of the Downtown Tulsa area- the Guthrie Green. This urban park is a cross between a garden and an amphitheater with events ranging from movie nights to workout classes hosted there. With family friendly concerts, food truck Wednesday's, and fountains to play in, the Guthrie Green has become a central point for the Tulsa Arts District. In fact, on the first Friday of every month, local businesses in this area center their First Friday Art Crawl around the Green, with exhibits at Philbrook Downtown, 108 Contemporary, and the Hardesty Arts Center (AHHA) which border the park. This monthly event brings the community together to enjoy the best food, drinks, and entertainment that the Tulsa Arts District can provide. \n\nToday, the Tulsa Arts District is one of the most diverse areas in all of Tulsa. It hosts restaurants, clubs, museums, and businesses and is a prime example of urban living. There is presently construction which will more than double the number of permanent residents in this artistic conclave. On its present path, the area will continue to develop as a hub of the community welcoming all people as it acknowledges its past while looking to a vibrant and inclusive future.\n\nMajor employers in Downtown Tulsa include the corporate headquarters of Williams Companies and ONEOK. BOK Financial is headquartered there as well.\n\nThe \"Tulsa World\" and This Land Press have their headquarters in Downtown Tulsa.\n\n\n"}

The large engineering company ČKD bears his name. He died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp.\n\nKolben was born into the German-speaking Jewish family of a small shopkeeper in the village of Strančice, southeast from Prague. He had nine siblings and from the age of 15 he was left to care for himself. After completing his secondary education in Prague, Kolben studied there at the German Technical University. After finishing university he obtained a two-year Gerstner's stipend that allowed him to study abroad. In 1887 he traveled to Zürich, Paris and London and in April 1888 he sailed with his wife Malvinus to the United States, where he stayed for five years. After arriving in New York he set off on further study trips traveling across the country. He obtained a position as an engineer at the Edison Machine Works in Schenectady, then as an assistant of Thomas Edison in Orange, New Jersey and finally as the chief-engineer in Edison's laboratories. In 1889 he visited the laboratory of Nikola Tesla to learn about the poly-phase alternating current motors and power system the inventor was developing there.\n\nIn 1892 Kolben returned to Europe and for two years worked as the chief-designer in Switzerland for company Oerlikon which manufactured poly-phase alternating current generators. In 1896 he returned to Bohemia and, in the same year, set up a company named \"\"Kolben a spol.\" in Vysočany, an industrial district of Prague. A 60 kW alternator was the first system constructed. With secured financial investment from a bank the company became a stock holding company in 1898. In 1899 it was renamed to \"Elektrotechnická a. s.\". In 1911 Kolben invited Edison to visit Prague.\n\nThe company produced large electrotechnical systems such as hydro-electric power stations, locomotives and machines. Used technologies and equipment were much above standards of the time - for example instead of using a centralized power source and mechanical transmitters the machines were fitted with electrical engines.\n\nIn 1921 the company merged with another engineering company \"Českomoravská strojírna\" into \"Českomoravská-Kolben a. s.\". In 1927 it merged with \"A. s. strojírny\" (formerly \"Breitfeld & Daněk\") into \"Českomoravská-Kolben-Daněk\", the ČKD. Kolben had served as the director until 1939. The company produced a wide array of electrotechnic and engineering systems and also complete industrial plants. ČKD employed up to 15,000 people.\n\nKolben also founded two other companies: \"Pražská továrna na káble\" in Prague-Hostivař (power cables) and \"Pražská elektroinstalační společnost\"\" in Prague-Hloubětín (wiring systems). He published dozens of articles, mostly about electrotechnic and engineering.\n\nImmediately after the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Nazis (1939) Kolben was recalled from his position as the director (March 16) and later imprisoned in the concentration camp Theresienstadt. He died there abandoned and exhausted. Almost all members of his family were imprisoned; 26 of them were killed by the Germans. His grandson Jindřich (b. 1926) survived.\n\nČKD was heavily damaged during the last days of World War II. It later employed up to 50,000 people and was known mainly for locomotives and trams. Mismanagement during the new free-market era (1990s) and technological delay accumulated during previous decades resulted in bankruptcy in 1998 and a massive reduction in production.\n\n\n\n"}

This is typically caused by leakage of the material between the two surfaces of a mold (beginning along the parting line) or between the base material and the mold (in the case of overmolding). Molding flash is seen when the optimized parameter on cull height is not calibrated. Proper design of mold parting surfaces can reduce or eliminate flash.\n\nMolding flash can be caused from old or worn mold cavities that no longer fit tightly together. Other times, the complexity of the part requires so many mating pieces with such precise geometries that it is almost impossible to create a perfect fit on every impression. Most often, the type of material being molded, and its attendant viscosity in its liquid form, is the primary factor that leads to the creation of the unwanted mold flash.\n\nThe process of removing flash, known as deflashing, is commonly performed via cutting, breaking, grinding, or tumbling. Some foundries use robot autogrinders to remove this unwanted material. It is very typical for molders to have their operators trim flash with hand tools at the molding machine between cycles. Many molders and OEMs seek out the use of batch processes including vibratory tumbling, cryogenic deflashing or media blasting to remove unwanted flash from large batches of parts.\n\nIn plastic injection, a faint mark called a witness mark (or witness line) will occur along the parting line. This is unavoidable and is usually accepted despite the minor aesthetics issue. However, some part surfaces (e.g. when used for sealing) cannot tolerate witness marks, and thus either the marks must be removed post-molding or the mold redesigned.\n\n"}
{"id": "2020264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020264", "title": "Frustration of purpose", "text": "Frustration of purpose\n\nFrustration of purpose, in law, is a defense to enforcement of a contract. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract such that the performance of the contract is radically different from performance of the contract that was originally contemplated by both parties, and both parties knew of the principal purpose at the time the contract was made. Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party or even nature can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract. The concept is also called commercial frustration.\n\nFor example, if Joe gets a mortgage for a new home, suppose after three years, the home is destroyed, through no fault of Joe's. Without a hell or high water clause, Joe might be exempt from the remainder of the mortgage, as the principal purpose of the contract, to have a home to live in, has been compromised. However, he might still have a foreclosure on his credit rating.\n\nFrustration of purpose is often confused with the closely related doctrine of impossibility. The distinction is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, but frustration of purpose concerns the reason a party entered into the contract. An example is if entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so that she can open a restaurant that serves only Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat. If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.\n\nHowever, if the Tibetan Speckled Lizard suddenly goes extinct, Emily may be excused from performing the contract because Larry knew her primary purpose for entering into the lease was to serve Tibetan Speckled Lizard, and the purpose has been frustrated. In the second scenario, the parties could still carry out their obligations under the lease, but one of them no longer has a reason to.\n\nThe \"Restatement (Second) of Contracts\", Section 265, defines frustration of purpose:\nA circumstance is not deemed to be a \"basic assumption on which the contract is made\" unless the change in circumstances could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was made. As a result, it is rarely invoked successfully. Successful invocations usually come in waves during times of substantial tumult, such as after the passage of Prohibition, when bars and taverns no longer had a reason for their leases, or during major wars, when demand for many consumer goods and services drops far below what is normal.\n\nIf the defense is successfully invoked, the contract is terminated, and the parties are left as they are at the time of the litigation.\n\nThe English case of \"Taylor v Caldwell\" established the doctrine of frustration, alleviating the potential harshness of \"sanctity of contract\". Here, two parties contracted on the hire of a music hall, for the performance of concerts. Subsequent to contracting, but prior to the dates of hire, the music hall burned down. Since the contract was impossible to perform, Judge Blackburn held that the absolute liability set forth in \"Paradine v Jane\" would not apply here, as there was an implied term that the music hall would be in existence at the date of the planned concerts. \n\nThe requirement of \"impossibility\" in \"Taylor v Caldwell\" was modified in the 1903 case of \"Krell v Henry\", which concerned a party who had rented a room for the purpose of watching the coronation procession of Edward VII. The king fell ill and the coronation was indefinitely postponed. The hirer refused to pay for the room, so the owner sued for breach of contract; and the hirer then countersued for the return of his £25 deposit. The court determined that the cancellation of the coronation was unforeseeable by the parties, and discharged the contract, leaving the parties as they were: the hirer lost his one-third deposit, and the owner lost the rest of the rent. The court reasoned that the doctrine of \"impossibility\" could not be applied in this case because it was technically been possible for the hirer to take possession of the flat and sit on the balcony. However, the owner knew the only reason the hirer would want to rent the flat was to watch the procession; had the hirer actually gone to the flat and sat on the balcony, he would have seen nothing of interest. Thus the purpose of the contract had been frustrated by an outside event (the King's illness and consequent cancellation of the parade), justifying termination (but not rescission) of the contract.\n"}

During the 20th century era, companies used mainly equipment like dictation machines, typewriters, and dumb terminals with access to a mainframe computer, to address customer issues. The earliest use of computers for customer service was done through the use of mainframe software. Customers would submit paper forms or communicate their issue by phone to customer service agents who would seek for avenues to handle the issues.\n\nIn the 1960s, companies began to set up call centers and also train staff to receive and handle customer enquiries in an organized and efficient manner. This was the era of Interactive voice response (IVR) which became a big boost to telephone customer service system. Later on, Desktop PCs and email significantly improved help desk systems. Customers could communicate their problems by email, bypassing paper forms. Help desk agents could provide status updates and resolutions by email as well.\n\nMeanwhile, the actual introduction of help desk systems began in the 1980 when the internet was officially made available for public use. Many companies started outsourcing their customer service department. This led to massive use of email and live chat systems in the 1990s. This new development enabled several US companies to outsource their help desk to low-cost countries like India and the Philippines.\n\nIn any case the real invention of help desk software came in the 2000s when companies began to use diverse kind of software packages to deal with customer-care issues. This led to the massive production of different kinds of help desk software programs across the internet and the world at large. In recent times, the internet and networked systems make help desk software more interactive and participatory for customers and the agents. Customer can now submit and track their issues more easily.\n\nHelp desk software automates customer services in diverse ways. It typically consists of at least three parts. These include Ticket Management, Automation Suite, and Reporting/Optimization.\n\nHelp desk software has a point of contact for customers to send their queries and a ticketing system that tracks and organizes issues for faster resolution. It may also have a feature that aggregates and organizes queries and answers into a knowledge base, such as FAQs or guide articles. It may accommodate multiple points of contact; a working dashboard; and analytics section. It may also have a feature that allows agents to escalate issues to a higher level.\n\nMore advanced help desk applications feature online chat, insights and analytics, automated processes, multiple contact channels, reporting tools, collaboration tools, and a CRM feature.\n\nToday help desk software is generally classified by its deployment, business size of the target users, or source code accessibility. The basic types include:\n\n\nMost brands and models of help desk software in use today fall in one of the classifications outlined above.\n\nWeb-based and cloud-hosted help desk software packages are becoming very popular today. Social network channels are also being widely used as they are both interactive and allow for effective community support. The new generation of help desk software also offers real-time updates and uses remote desktop access.\n\nWith the massive increase in development and use of help desk software, the future holds more for companies that make use of these system. Based on current trends, the future projection envisages the following points for the help desk software technology:\n\n\nThe following benefits are typically associated with help desk software:\n\n\nDespite benefits of help desk software, there are some disadvantages related to it as well, mainly:\n\nMany of the problems listed above can easily be surmounted if proper research, planning and inquiries are made beforehand.\n\n"}

Picower (May 5, 1942 – October 25, 2009) was an American investor involved in the Madoff investment scandal. He appears to have been the largest beneficiary of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, and his estate settled the claims against it for $7.2 billion.\n\nPicower was a certified public accountant and lawyer, but made most of his fortune by investing with Madoff.\n\nAs an accountant at Laventhol & Horwath in the 1980s, Picower set up questionable tax shelters. When the IRS challenged their validity, one of Picower's clients sued him and the firm. The case was settled out of court.\n\nIn 1983, Picower was rebuked by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for late disclosure of his greater than 5% position in a company involved in a merger.\n\nIn 1991, Picower and Anthony Cerami established a charity, the Picower Institute for Medical Research, with an initial endowment of $10 million. Researchers there, led by Kevin J. Tracey, made a potentially valuable discovery, with possible applications in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It was spun off into a for-profit company, Cytokine Networks, which was later merged with privately held PharmaSciences to form Cytokine PharmaSciences. However, it was revealed that Picower owned 76% of PharmaSciences stock and actually controlled 86.2%, putting him in a conflict of interest in the merger negotiations.\n\nAfter Physician Computer Network, Inc., went bankrupt, Picower, the chairman of the board and 45% shareholder, had to give $21 million to other shareholders in 2000 after it was discovered that company executives had falsified financial statements.\n\nAlaris Medical Systems, 65% owned by Picower, was taken over by Cardinal Health in 2004 for $1.6 billion.\n\nPicower was listed by \"Forbes\" magazine as one of the 400 richest people in the United States for 2009, his only time on the list. Forbes, which listed Picower at no. 371, placed his net worth at $1 billion, although the magazine acknowledged that the former lawyer and accountant is \"likely worth billions more.\"\n\nThe Jeffry M. and Barbara Picower Foundation was created in 1989 by Picower and his wife Barbara. Barbara Picower was listed as Executive Director and trustee, with both Picowers being members of the board of directors. Longtime friend Bernard Madoff managed foundation assets listed at over $1 billion. It distributed over $268 million in grants to various American organizations, including Human Rights First and the New York Public Library. In 2002, it granted $50 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology neuroscience research center, which was subsequently renamed the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory. However, the Picower Foundation was forced to close in 2009 due to losses arising from the uncovering of Madoff's Ponzi scheme.\n\nIt has been reported that between December 1995 and December 2008, Picower and his family withdrew \"from their various Madoff accounts $5.1 billion more than they invested.\" \nIn June 2009, Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Madoff's assets, filed a lawsuit against Picower in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan), seeking the return of $7.2 billion in profits, alleging that Picower and his wife knew or should have known that their rates of return were \"implausibly high\", with some accounts showing annual returns ranging from 120% to more than 550% from 1996 through 1998, and 950% in 1999. According to a June 28, 2009, MSNBC article, that would make the Picowers the biggest beneficiaries of Madoff's scam, exceeding even Madoff himself. The Picowers' lawyer, William D. Zabel of Schulte Roth & Zabel, responded that, \"They were totally shocked by his fraud and were in no way complicit in it.\"\n\nOn November 1, 2009, an additional court filing from the Madoff trustee documented an apparently fraudulent gain benefiting Picower.\n\"According to the new filing, Mr. Picower opened an account with Mr. Madoff on April 18, 2006, by wiring a check for $125 million, more than a quarter of the entire sum he invested with Mr. Madoff over time. Within two weeks, the $125 million deposit had purportedly grown to $164 million because of a dramatic ‘gain’ on the securities held in the account—all of which supposedly had been purchased three months earlier ... Five months later, Mr. Picower withdrew his original $125 million, leaving $81 million in the account. There is no legitimate explanation for these events nor any possibility that they escaped Picower’s notice.\"\n\nOn 17 December 2010, it was announced that a settlement of $7.2 billion had been reached with the Picower estate to resolve the Madoff trustee suit, and repay losses in the Madoff fraud. Madoff has suggested that Picower was allowed to remain as a client because he was \"the Ponzi equivalent of a bank too big to fail: an investor too big to fire.\" It would have been impossible for Madoff to find enough cash to completely redeem his multi-billion account.\n\nOn October 25, 2009, Jeffry Picower died at his Palm Beach home. Picower's wife Barbara told dispatchers she found him \"at the bottom of their swimming pool\" at their oceanfront estate shortly after noon, Palm Beach police said. He was taken to Good Samaritan Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead about 80 minutes later.\n\nAccording to the Palm Beach Police Department, \"An autopsy of the body of Jeffry M. Picower was performed this morning. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office determined that Mr. Picower suffered a massive heart attack while in the swimming pool resulting in accidental drowning.\"\n\nHe was buried on October 27, 2009, in Mount Ararat Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.\n\nIn 2011, Barbara Picower resumed philanthropic activities, setting up a new foundation called the JPB Foundation with assets that remained from Jeffry Picower's estate following the legal settlement. \"Forbes\" reported that the foundation was established with a $100 million endowment. As of 2018, the JPB Foundation has over $3.7 billion in total assets. According to Foundation Center's list of the largest grant-making foundations, The JPB Foundation is the 24th largest foundation by asset size in the nation. Barbara Picower currently serves as the President and Director of the JPB Foundation.\n"}

He served from December 2004 to February 2007 as the president of the municipality of Tijuana. He is the son of former Mexico City mayor Carlos Hank González and Guadalupe Rhon. Hank is the father of professional tennis player Tigre Hank and of Matador Alejandro Amaya.\n\nOf German descent, Jorge Hank Rhon studied at the Alexander von Humboldt German College and Industrial Engineering at the Universidad Anáhuac in the State of Mexico. In 1980 he founded the Grupo Taos, a company that operates pet stores and amusement parks of which he is the President of the Board and General Director. He moved to Tijuana in 1985 to manage the Agua Caliente Racetrack and formed the Grupo Caliente which includes the dog racing track, a hotel, a mall and a network of entertainment centers in 19 states of Mexico as well as 13 countries of Central, South America and Europe. The number of employees of the racetrack grew from 700 to close to 6,000. During his management Tijuana has hosted the Señorita México pageant, the World Boxing title fight between Julio César Chávez and Danilo Cabrera and from 1986 to 1988 the Caribe International Classic Horserace, considered the most important in Latin America. The Racetrack also hosts the Day of the Three Wise Men, Children's Day, Mother's Day where thousands of children and their mothers receive free food, gifts and an entertainment show since 1988. Hank also created the Cuauhtémoc Hank Foundation to give scholarships to students of all grades including studies in foreign schools. On April 20, 1988 a local newspaper columnist, Hector \"El Gato\" Felix Miranda was assassinated on his way to work. The gunmen turned out to be security guards at the Caliente track, and one had worked as well for Hank Rhon's father, Carlos Hank. To this day the independent newsweekly in Tijuana, ZETA, runs a full page ad with white letters: \"Jorge Hank: Why did your bodyguards assassinate me?\" 'El Gato' had been a fierce critic of the Hank family.\n\nHank won the Tijuana mayoral race of 2004, beating PAN candidate Jorge Ramos by a slim margin, thus ending 15 years of PAN government in Tijuana. \n\nThe most notable infrastructure improvement in Tijuana during the Hank administration was the multi-million investment on an underpass at the \"Alba Roja\" intersection, just south of the \"5 y 10\" intersection. The \"5 y 10\" intersection is one of the most famous in the city and with the heaviest traffic. The investment was for a figure close to 45 million pesos, more than four million dollars.\n\nOn February 8, 2005 the Hank administration inaugurated the five million pesos Center of Communication, Control, Computing and Command (C4) that included 60 high definition cameras. In order the reduce kidnappings, a problem of Tijuana for many years, the municipal government started a program of installing GPS devices on the cars of potential victims. In 2007, a program of road safety cameras was introduced in Tijuana that issued speeding tickets in which some drivers received up to 800 tickets issued the same day, same time, and on the same location.\n\nThe Hank administration produced significant urban development but failed to significantly reduce crime In 2007, the Operation Tijuana of the Federal Government only momentarily reduced serious crimes and ordinary crimes increased 40% and it was detected corruption amongst the federal forces. The operation was then extended to the five municipalities of the state and dubbed Operation Baja California, per request of the governor Eugenio Elorduy Walther.\n\nOn February 20, 2007 Hank requested a license to leave his post as mayor. The license was approved by nine PRI representatives with six PAN representatives rejecting the license and one PRD representative abstaining from voting. Multiple billboards reporting Hank actions as mayor were put out after the annual report and PAN representative complained and offered to remove the PAN-sponsored radio spots on fighting radar camera-issued tickets.\n\nAt the end of 2006, Jorge Hank expressed his wishes to run a campaign for the 2007 Baja California state election.\nThis flared up comments from PAN politicians saying that he would be violating the state's \"Antichapulin\" (\"anti-grasshopper\") law which prohibits a person of public office to \"jump\" from one charge to another without ending their current term.\n\nIn February 2007 he requested permission from leaving his post as municipal president to accept the candidacy for governor by the \"Alianza para que vivas mejor\" (The Alliance So You May live better), which was approved by his party's regidores and denied by the PAN regidores. The PAN also accused five district electoral council members of partiality towards Hank because they served as judges during his administration as president of Tijuana. The Federal Electoral Tribune rejected the complaint determining that the law does not have such restriction that would prevent these five lawyers from serving as judges and then as council members\n\nOn June 20, 2007, Baja California's state elections court voted 2 to 1 in favor of the validity of the so-called \"anti grasshopper law\" thus cancelling Hank's bid for Governor. He appealed the decision before the Federal Electoral Tribunal, which unanimously ruled to uphold his candidacy on July 7, holding that the state law contravened the electoral and political rights of the citizenry. Pending that decision, Hank was not a registered candidate and had to abstain from campaigning. The election date was Sunday August 5, 2007.\n\nAccording to the Baja California's State Electoral Institute, Jorge Hank lost the election by 8 points (almost 55,000 votes) against Jose Guadalupe Osuna Millan, PAN's candidate.\n\n\n"}

The famous road carried travelers across much of the country from the day it was commissioned on November 11, 1926 through June 25, 1985 when it was decommissioned.\n\nSince its construction, most motorists preferred to travel that way because the weather tended to be more hospitable than along the more northerly highways. Businesses and entire towns sprang up to cater to the ever-increasing traffic. Although it brought considerable prosperity, the thoroughfare also spawned bumper-to-bumper congestion in the communities and numerous accidents on the rural stretches leading to the gruesome nickname, “Bloody 66”.\n\nJust as it seemed the mostly two lane road could not handle another vehicle, on June 29, 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Interstate Highway Act into law, which allocated $25 billion for the construction of of interstate highways. Over the next 29 years, section after section of Route 66 was methodically bypassed by multi-lane, high speed expressways enabling motorists to increase their speeds and avoid hazardous congestion. This was a time-saving advantage to those on the move, but a distinct disadvantage to businesses and communities along the Route. Where customers once thronged, they rarely showed up at all, anymore.\n\nBy 1994, Route 66 was well on its way to becoming little more than miles of memories. Unaware of these declining conditions, in August of that year, David and Mary Lou Knudson set out to relive their early experiences along the legendary road. Mary Lou remembered traveling it during World War II with her parents as her father, a U.S. Air Force Sergeant, drove between several bases in Illinois and California. David remembered the trip he made in 1963 to move from Detroit to Los Angeles as being like a “2,400 mile carnival”. But this time, they couldn’t even find the famous byway. They soon discovered it was no longer a U.S. Highway and was not on their map as “US 66”. So the Knudsons stopped at a truck stop west of Chicago to ask where it was, and the clerk sold them the “Here It Is” map set which guided them to and along the original road.\n\nThe moment they got on what was once Route 66, the Knudsons realized that something was very wrong. The once colorful and often gaudy trading posts, side shows, rare animal displays, motels and cafés were gone. In their place was mile after mile of roadside that was little more than boarded up buildings. Many stretches of roadbed were poorly maintained or completely closed to traffic. Entire towns that were once bustling tourist meccas were all but shut down.\n\nThey were saddened by the deterioration of such an important American icon; so much so, they decided to do something about it. As they traveled, they photographed many of the buildings and tape recorded captions for each of their locations. They had planned to take a week to travel to their home in Los Angeles but that turned into 3 weeks. They arrived home laden with hundreds of photos and several tapes of captions. On the trip, David decided to sell the shares in his business and commit his time to developing a nonprofit corporation that would work to save Route 66.\n\nTo that end, the Knudson’s first step was to contact the gentleman who had prepared the Route 66 map set they had used to cross the country. He directed them to the National Park Service office in Santa Fe where they had prepared a study of the Route for Senators Pete Domenici (R) and Jeff Bingaman (D). Between the Knudsons, the Senators and New Mexico Congresswoman Heather Wilson (R) a Congressional Bill was drafted that would help fund the restoration of the famous highway. In 1999, the \"National Route 66 Preservation Bill\" was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The act provides $10 million in matching fund grants to individuals, corporations and communities for the purpose of preserving or restoring historic properties along Route. To this day, David Knudson sits on the grant committee.\n\nAcquiring the funds for restoration through the Bill was the first tangible step toward the renaissance. Although restoration dollars were essential to the Knudson’s plans and hopes, bringing in tourists to patronize the businesses was every bit as important. This is where David’s advertising and publicity background came into play. He launched a worldwide campaign to turn the Route into a tourist destination. To this day, it is estimated that 40% of the business the Route generates comes from countries other than the U. S.\n\nThen came the Federation’s John Steinbeck Awards evenings. The purpose of these events was threefold:\n\nThe first John Steinbeck Awards Evening was scheduled for May, 1995 in Oklahoma City. The bombing of the Murrah building on April 19 put an end to those plans. The Federation suffered significant financial loss as a result, and it was not until October 1998 that a John Steinbeck Awards Evening took place; this time in Kingman, Arizona. From that year on, the evenings were produced annually in one Route 66 community after another until the last one in San Bernardino, California in September 2005. By that time, Route 66 communities were vying to have the evenings and they would build three-day, communitywide Route 66 celebrations around them. Shortly after that last event, Mary Lou Knudson suffered a debilitating stroke and died three years later. She had been the one who managed the myriad of details involved in producing the large events.\n\nAs the popularity of Route 66 grew around the world, an increasing number of tourists began driving the road and enjoying its history and sights, however most of them were not enjoying the vintage dining and lodging establishments that were so much the essence of early roadside Americana. The majority of travelers were staying in and eating in chain establishments that were familiar to them. The Knudsons had become acquainted with many of the owners of the vintage businesses and knew that most of their facilities were at least as clean and as well run as the chains. They were also usually much less expensive.\n\nIn order to introduce the public to the family-owned, vintage enterprises, the first “Route 66 Dining & Lodging Guide” was published in 1999. It was, and still is prepared from reviews conducted by the “Adopt-A-Hundred” adopters. The Federation’s “Adopt-A-Hundred” Program was initially developed to keep an eye on possible preservation problems along the Route such as a bridge, a business or a stretch of roadbed being closed. Adopters canvassed their sections once a year watching for preservation trouble. So, the adopters were asked to review the dining and lodging businesses while they traveled their sections. The current edition is the 14th and includes over 500 mostly vintage businesses.\n\nWith the intent of making it as easy as possible for travelers to find the most popular alignments, the Federation commissioned Route 66 artist, historian and cartographer, Jerry McClanahan to produce a map guide. The product, introduced in 2005, was the 200 page, spiral bound EZ66 GUIDE For Travelers. It is now in its 3rd edition.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24547557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24547557", "title": "New Public Administration", "text": "New Public Administration\n\nNew Public Administration is an anti-positivist, anti-technical, and anti-hierarchical reaction against traditional public administration. A practiced theory in response to the ever changing needs of the public and how institutions and administrations go about solving them. Focus is on the role of government and how they can provide these services to citizens in which are a part of public interest, by means, but not limited to public policy.\n\nNew Public Administration traces its origins to the first Minnowbrook Conference held in 1968 under the patronage of Dwight Waldo. This conference brought together the top scholars in public administration and management to discuss and reflect on the state of the field and its future. The 1960s in the USA was a time of unusual social and political turbulence and upheaval. In this context, Waldo concluded that neither the study nor the practice of public administration was responding suitably to the escalating turmoil and the complications that arose from those conditions. Part of the reasoning for this Waldo argued, was the general mistrust that had become associated with public administration itself. A call to revamp the ethical obligations of the service sector was necessary in rebuilding the public's trust of government and bureaucracy in which had been plagued by corruption and the narrow self interests of others. Moving toward a more ethical public service, then, required attention to the underlying values that support public service-and public servants-in any sector.\n\nThe new public management(npm) did not offer public servants an alternative model to help them resolve emerging conflicts and tensions. Concepts of citizenship, democracy or public interest have evolved over time and they are continuing to evolve. Consequently, the role of government and the role of the public service are being transformed in ways that push beyond the constraints of the Classic model he lenses of varying perspectives can challenge, clarify, and create a history that boasts enough depth to serve as not only a history in a traditional sense but also an interactive timeline that ignites constant improvement. At its core, public service requires a vision that extends beyond narrow self-interest. Waldo sees public administration and bureaucracy as integrally bound to civilization and to our culture in two senses: the evolution of civilization itself was dependent upon public administration and related concepts are constitutive elements within out specific civilization and culture.\n\nNew Public Administration theory deals with the following issues:\n\nFirst, a ‘new’ theory should start with the ideal of democratic citizenship. The public service derives its true meaning from its mandate to serve citizens to advance the public good. This is the raison d’être of the institution, the source of motivation and pride of all those who choose to make it their life, whether for a season or for an entire career.\n\nThese are:\n\n\nNPA provides solutions for achieving these goals, popularly called 4 D's i.e. Decentralisation, Debureaucratisation, Delegation and Democratisation.\n\nThough New Public Administration brought public administration closer to political science, it was criticized as anti-theoretic and anti-management. Robert T. Golembiewski describes it as radicalism in words and status quo in skills and technologies. Further, it must be counted as only a cruel reminder of the gap in the field between aspiration and performance. Golembiewski considers it as a temporary and transitional phenomena. In other words, we can say that the solutions for achieving the goals and anti-goals were not provided by the NPA scholars explicitly. Secondly, how much one should decentralize or delegate or debureaucratize or democratize in order to achieve the goals? On this front NPA is totally silent.\n\nAs said in \"A New Synthesis of Public Administration,\" governments have always been called upon to make difficult decisions, undertake complicated initiatives and face complex problems characteristics of the period. This is not in dispute. Nonetheless, the current circumstances is to determine what can be handled in the traditional way and what must be done differently.\n\nGovernments have always been called upon to face difficult problems. Setting priorities and making choices have always been difficult. For example, eliminating a sizable deficit is “merely” a difficult problem, although it is hard to believe when one is in the middle of such a heart-wrenching exercise. This entails making choices among equally deserving public purposes and making tough decisions about what should be preserved for the future. It requires reconciling future needs with what could garner a sufficient degree of public support in the short term to move forward. Academic public administration has lagged considerably behind practicing public administration. Improved curricula and a refocusing of emphasis upon the policy dynamics of government administration will be important factors in enticing more students to study of public administration. It is more important to increase the number and improving the geographic spread of universities with public affairs programs, integrating public affairs components into the curricula of other graduate and professional programs, developing many more in-service, mid-career educational programs for public servants, and utilizing existing resources to strengthen public affairs programs.\n\nThe motives behind the promotion of New Public Administration is also in question in the case of Hong Kong. As Anthony Cheung argues, officials often employed the rhetoric of New Public Administration to roll back public expenditure and decrease welfare provision in the 1990s. Governors at that time used the excuse of administrative efficiency to curtail the power of the bureaucracy.\n\nFelix and Lloyd Nigro observe that New Public Administration has seriously jolted the traditional concepts and outlook of the discipline and enriched the subject by imparting a wider perspective by linking it closely to the society.\nThe overall focus in NPA movement seems to be to make administration to be less \"generic\" and more \"public\", less \"descriptive\" and more \"prescriptive\", less \"institution-oriented\" and more \"client-oriented\", less \"neutral\" and more \"normative\" but should be no less scientific all the same.\n"}
{"id": "673350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=673350", "title": "OLAP cube", "text": "OLAP cube\n\nIn database engineering in computing, OLAP cube is a term that typically refers to a multi-dimensional array of data.\n\n\"OLAP\" is an acronym for online analytical processing, which is a computer-based technique of analyzing data to look for insights. The term \"cube\" here refers to a multi-dimensional\ndataset, which is also sometimes called a hypercube if the number of dimensions is greater than 3.\n\nA cube can be considered a multi-dimensional generalization of a two- or three-dimensional spreadsheet. For example, a company might wish to summarize financial data by product, by time-period, and by city to compare actual and budget expenses. Product, time, city and scenario (actual and budget) are the data's dimensions.\n\n\"Cube\" is a shorthand for \"multidimensional dataset\", given that data can have an arbitrary number of \"dimensions\". The term hypercube is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three dimensions. A cube is not a \"cube\" in the strict mathematical sense, as all the sides are not necessarily equal. But this term is used widely.\n\n\"Slice\" is a term for a dimension which is held constant for all cells so that multi-dimensional information can be shown in a two-dimensional physical space of a spreadsheet or pivot table.\n\nEach cell of the cube holds a number that represents some \"measure\" of the business, such as sales, profits, expenses, budget and forecast.\n\nOLAP data is typically stored in a star schema or snowflake schema in a relational data warehouse or in a special-purpose data management system. Measures are derived from the records in the fact table and dimensions are derived from the dimension tables.\n\nThe elements of a dimension can be organized as a hierarchy, a set of parent-child relationships, typically where a parent member summarizes its children. Parent elements can further be aggregated as the children of another parent.\n\nFor example, May 2005's parent is Second Quarter 2005 which is in turn the child of Year 2005. Similarly cities are the children of regions; products roll into product groups and individual expense items into types of expenditure.\n\nConceiving data as a cube with hierarchical dimensions leads to conceptually straightforward operations to facilitate analysis. Aligning the data content with a familiar visualization enhances analyst learning and productivity. The user-initiated process of navigating by calling for page displays interactively, through the specification of slices via rotations and drill down/up is sometimes called \"slice and dice\". Common operations include slice and dice, drill down, roll up, and pivot.\n\"Slice\" is the act of picking a rectangular subset of a cube by choosing a single value for one of its dimensions, creating a new cube with one fewer dimension. The picture shows a slicing operation: The sales figures of all sales regions and all product categories of the company in the year 2005 and 2006 are \"sliced\" out of the data cube.\n\n\"Dice\": The dice operation produces a subcube by allowing the analyst to pick specific values of multiple dimensions. The picture shows a dicing operation: The new cube shows the sales figures of a limited number of product categories, the time and region dimensions cover the same range as before.\n\n\"Drill Down/Up\" allows the user to navigate among levels of data ranging from the most summarized (up) to the most detailed (down).\nThe picture shows a drill-down operation: The analyst moves from the summary category \"Outdoor-Schutzausrüstung\" to see the sales figures for the individual products.\n\"Roll-up\": A roll-up involves summarizing the data along a dimension. The summarization rule might be computing totals along a hierarchy or applying a set of formulas such as \"profit = sales - expenses\".\n\n\"Pivot\" allows an analyst to rotate the cube in space to see its various faces. For example, cities could be arranged vertically and products horizontally while viewing data for a particular quarter. Pivoting could replace products with time periods to see data across time for a single product.\n\nThe picture shows a pivoting operation: The whole cube is rotated, giving another perspective on the data.\n\nIn database theory, an OLAP cube is an abstract representation of a projection of an RDBMS relation. Given a relation of order \"N\", consider a projection that subtends \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" as the key and \"W\" as the residual attribute. Characterizing this as a function,\n\nthe attributes \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" correspond to the axes of the cube, while the \"W\" value corresponds to the data element that populates each cell of the cube.\n\nInsofar as two-dimensional output devices cannot readily characterize three dimensions, it is more practical to project \"slices\" of the data cube (we say \"project\" in the classic vector analytic sense of dimensional reduction, not in the SQL sense, although the two are conceptually similar),\n\nwhich may suppress a primary key, but still have some semantic significance, perhaps a slice of the triadic functional representation for a given \"Z\" value of interest.\n\nThe motivation behind OLAP displays harks back to the \"cross-tabbed report\" paradigm of 1980s DBMS, and to earlier contingency tables from 1904. The resulting spreadsheet-style display, where values of \"X\" populate row $1; values of \"Y\" populate column $A; and values of \"g\" : ( \"X\", \"Y\" ) → \"W\" populate the individual cells \"southeast of\" $B2, so to speak, $B2 itself included.\n\n"}

Regulatory authorities like EMA and FDA have published guidelines relating to process validation. The purpose of process validation is to ensure varied inputs lead to consistent and high quality outputs. Process validation is an ongoing process that must be frequently adapted as manufacturing feedback is gathered. End-to-end validation of production processes is essential in determining product quality because quality cannot always be determined by finished-product inspection. Process validation can be broken down into 3 steps: process design, process qualification, and continued process verification.\n\nIn this stage data from the development phase are gathered and analyzed to define the commercial manufacturing process. By understanding the commercial process a framework for quality specifications can be established and used as the foundation of a control strategy. Process design is the first of three stages of process validation. Data from the development phase is gathered and analyzed to understand end-to-end system processes. These data are used to establish benchmarks for quality and production control.\n\nDesign of experiments is used to discover possible relationships and sources of variation as quickly as possible. A cost benefit analysis should be conducted to determine if such an operation is necessary.\n\nQuality by Design is an approach to pharmaceutical manufacturing that stresses quality should be built into products rather than tested into products; that product quality should be considered at the earliest possible stage rather than at the end of the manufacturing process. Input variables are isolated in order to identify the root cause of potential quality issues and the manufacturing process is adapted accordingly.\n\nProcess Analytical Technology is used to measure critical process parameters (CPP) and critical quality attributes (CQA). PAT facilitates measurement of quantitative production variables in real time and allows access to relevant manufacturing feedback. PAT can also be used in the design process to generate a process qualification.\n\nCritical Process Parameters Operating parameters that are considered essential to maintaining product output within specified quality target guidelines.\n\nCritical Quality Attributes (CQA) are chemical, physical, biological and microbiological attributes that can be defined, measured, and continually monitored to ensure final product outputs remain within acceptable quality limits. CQA are an essential aspect of a manufacturing control strategy and should be identified in stage 1 of Process Validation: Process design. During this stage acceptable limits, baselines, and data collection and measurement protocols should be established. Data from the design process and data collected during production should be kept by the manufacturer and used to evaluated product quality and process control. Historical data can also help manufacturers better understand operational process and input variables as well as better identify true deviations from quality standards compared to false positives. Should a serious product quality issue arise, historical data would be essential in identifying the sources of errors and implementing corrective measures.\n\nIn this stage the process design is assessed to conclude if the process is able to meet determined manufacturing targets. In this stage all production processes and manufacturing equipment is proofed to confirm quality and output capabilities. Critical quality attributes are evaluated and critical process parameters taken into account to confirm product quality. Once the process qualification stage has been successfully accomplished production can begin. Process Qualification is the second phase of process validation...\n\nContinued Process Verification is the ongoing monitoring of all aspects of the production cycle. It aims to ensure that all levels of production are controlled and regulated. Deviations from prescribed output methods and final product irregularities are flagged by a process analytics database system. The FDA requires production data be recorded (FDA requirements (§ 211.180(e)). Continued process verification is stage 3 of process validation.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency defines a similar process known as Ongoing Process Verification. This alternative method of process validation is recommended by the EMA for validating processes on a continuous basis. Continuous Process Verification analyses Critical Process Parameters and Critical Quality Attributes in real time to confirm production remain within acceptable levels and meet standards set by ICH Q8, Pharmaceutical Quality Systems, and Good manufacturing practice.\n\n\n"}

The agency was established in 1997, consolidating the city's Water Department with other city functions.\n\nSPU owns two water collection facilities: one in the Cedar River watershed, which supplies 70 percent of the drinking water used by 1.3 million people in Seattle and surrounding suburbs (primarily the city south of the Lake Washington Ship Canal) and the other in the Tolt River watershed which supplies the other 30 percent (primarily the city north of the canal).\n\nFrom the city's founding through the 1880s, Seattle's water was provided by several private companies. In a July 8, 1889 election, barely a month after the Great Seattle Fire (June 6, 1889) gave a dramatic illustration of the limitations of the city's water supply, Seattle's citizens voted 1,875 to 51 to acquire and operate their own water system. In accordance with this vote, the city Water Department acquired the Lake Union and Spring Hill plants for $400,000.\n\nThis was understood from the first to be only a temporary expedient, inadequate to the expected growth of the city. Attention soon focused on the Cedar River, an idea first proposed in the 1870s; the question was how to bring that water to the city. From 1892, the responsibility for doing so fell to newly hired City Engineer Reginald H. Thomson and his assistant George F. Cotterill. Besides the technical challenges, they and a series of Seattle mayors had to keep the citizenry on board to move forward with this expensive project through the Panic of 1893.\n\nThe Klondike Gold Rush put Seattle on a sound economic footing. The 1901 completion of Cedar River Supply System No. 1 (active from February 21, 1901) gave the city a steady supply of clean water with an intake 28 miles from the city itself; this was supplemented by Cedar River Supply System No. 2 in 1909. Together, these systems gave the city a supply of more than of water a day.\n\nThe original Cedar River pipeline was made of reinforced wooden pipe \"big enough so a small boy could stand upright in it\" and carried of water a day. By 1950, three big mains carried up to of water a day.\n\nTo guard against contamination at the source, the city purchased or otherwise gained control of of land and placed it under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Sanitation. The city also established an extensive system of reservoirs within city limits. By 1919, six reservoirs had a combined capacity of . In 1950, the city owned \"about two-thirds\" of the watershed, the federal government \"about one-fourth\"; the remainder, \"around eleven square miles,\" was owned by private lumber companies.\n\nSeattle has at times contracted to provide water for entities out outside of city limits.\n\nIn recent decades, the Seattle Regional Water System has significantly improved conservation. 2008 usage was roughly equal to usage in 1960, despite roughly a 35% increase in population over that period. From 1990 to 2012 total water usage declined 29%, despite a population increase of 17%.\n\n\n\n"}

Entertainment, former majority owner of The WB. The network's name is an abbreviation derived from the first letters of the names of its two parent corporations (CBS and Warner Bros.).\n\nThe CW Television Network made its debut on September 18, 2006, after its two predecessors, UPN and The WB, respectively ceased independent operations on September 15 and 17 of that year. The CW's first two nights of programming – on September 18 and 19, 2006 – consisted of reruns and launch-related specials. The CW marked its formal launch date on September 20, 2006, with the two-hour premiere of the seventh cycle of \"America's Next Top Model\". Originally, the network's programming lineup was intended to appeal mainly to women between the ages of 18 and 34, although starting in 2011 the network increased in programming that appeals to men. As of August 2017, the CW's audience is 50% male and 50% female. The network currently runs programming seven days a week: airing Mondays through Fridays in the afternoon and Sundays through Fridays in prime time, along with a Saturday morning live-action educational programming block produced by Litton Entertainment called \"One Magnificent Morning\", which is the successor to the animation block Vortexx.\n\nIt is also available in Canada on pay television providers through stations owned-and-operated by CBS Corporation and affiliates that are located within proximity to the Canada–United States border (whose broadcasts of CW shows are subject to simultaneous substitution laws imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, if a Canadian network holds the broadcast rights); it is also available through two affiliates owned by Tribune Media that are classified in the United States as superstations – New York City affiliate WPIX and Los Angeles affiliate KTLA.\n\nAdditionally, The CW is available in Mexico through affiliates located near the Mexico–U.S. border (such as KFMB-DT2/San Diego-Tijuana, KECY-DT3 in El Centro, California, KVIA-DT2 in El Paso, and KCWT-CD with simulcasters KFXV-LD2 and KNVO-DT4 in McAllen–Brownsville, Texas) on pay television providers. In both Canada and Mexico, some CW affiliate signals originating from the U.S. are receivable over-the-air in border areas depending on the station's signal coverage.\n\nThe CW Television Network is a successor to The WB and UPN, both of which launched within one week of each other in 1995.\n\nUPN and The WB both began just as the Fox network had started to secure a foothold with American television audiences. The two networks launched to limited fanfare and generally mediocre to poor results. However, over the subsequent 11 seasons, both were able to air several series that became quite popular (such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"\", \"7th Heaven\", \"Dawson's Creek\", \"Charmed\", \"Smallville\" and \"America’s Next Top Model\"). Towards the end of their first decade on the air, The WB and UPN were in decline, unable to reach the audience share or have the effect that Fox had gained within its first decade, much less that of the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS and NBC). In the eleven years that UPN and The WB were in operation, the two networks lost a combined $2 billion. Incidentally, Chris-Craft Industries, Viacom and Time Warner officials had discussed a possible merger of UPN and The WB as early as September 1995, only eight months after their respective launches; however, discussions ultimately broke down over issues on how to combine Chris-Craft and Tribune Broadcasting's station interests in the proposal to merge the networks, since the two companies' station portfolios overlapped with one another in several major markets than facing questionable futures as separate networks.\n\nExecutives from CBS and Time Warner announced on January 24, 2006, that they would respectively shut down UPN and The WB, and combine resources to form a new broadcast network, to be known as The CW Television Network, that would – at the outset – feature programming from both of its predecessors-to-be as well as new content developed specifically for the new network. CBS chairman Leslie Moonves explained that the name of the new network was formed from the first letters of CBS and Warner Bros, joking, \"We couldn't call it the WC for obvious reasons.\" Although some executives reportedly disliked the new name, Moonves stated in March 2006 that there was \"zero chance\" the name would change, citing research claiming 48% of the target demographic were already aware of the CW name.\n\nIn May 2006, The CW announced that it would pick up a combined thirteen programs from its two predecessors to air as part of the network's inaugural fall schedule: seven series held over from The WB (\"7th Heaven\", \"Beauty and the Geek\", \"Gilmore Girls\", \"One Tree Hill\", \"Reba\", \"Smallville\" and \"Supernatural\") and six held over from UPN (\"America's Next Top Model\", \"Veronica Mars\", \"Everybody Hates Chris\", \"Girlfriends\", \"All of Us\" and \"WWE SmackDown\"). Upon the network's launch, The CW chose to use the scheduling model utilized by The WB due in part to the fact that it had a more extensive base programming schedule than UPN, allowing for a larger total of weekly programming hours for the new network to fill. (The WB carried 30 hours of programming each week because of it having a children's program block and a daytime lineup that UPN did not offer; UPN was primarily a prime time-only network with 12 weekly hours of network programming at the time of the network's shutdown.)\n\nLike both UPN and The WB, The CW targets its programming towards younger audiences. CBS and Time Warner hoped that combining their networks' schedules and affiliate lineups would strengthen The CW into a fifth \"major\" broadcast network. One week before the network's official launch, on September 11, 2006, a new, full version of the network website, www.cwtv.com, was launched; the website began to feature more in-depth information about The CW's shows.\n\nThe CW launched with a premiere special/launch party from the CBS-produced \"Entertainment Tonight\" at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California on September 18, 2006, after a repeat of the tenth-season finale of \"7th Heaven\"; the same schedule was repeated on September 19, with the sixth-season finale of \"Gilmore Girls\" airing in the second hour of prime time. The network continued to air season finales from the previous season through the remainder of the first week, except for \"America's Next Top Model\" and \"WWE SmackDown\", which respectively began their new seasons on September 20 and 22, with two-hour premieres. When \"Top Model\" made its network premiere on September 20, 2006, The CW scored a 3.4 rating/5 share (with hourly ratings of 3.1/5 and 3.6/6; The CW placed fifth overall) in the Nielsen household ratings. It scored a 2.6 rating among Adults 18–49, finishing fourth in that age demographic and beating the 2.2 rating earned by Fox on that night. The network's second week consisted of season and series premieres for all of its other series from September 25 to October 1, with the exception of \"Veronica Mars\", which debuted its third season on October 3.\n\nDespite having several of the most popular programs carried over from UPN and The WB as part of its schedule, The CW – even though it experienced some success with newer programs that launched in subsequent seasons which became modest hits – largely struggled to gain an audience foothold throughout its first five years on the air. Because of declining viewership for the network during the 2007–08 season and effects from the Writers Guild of America strike, the network announced on March 4, 2008, that it would eliminate its comedy department (dismissing executive vice president of comedy Kim Fleary, and senior vice president of comedy Steve Veisel), while also combining its drama and current programming departments into a single scripted programming unit. The corporate restructuring – which also included the elimination of certain positions, other newly opened positions being left unfilled, layoffs from the Kids' WB unit (as the block was set to be replaced by The CW4Kids on May 24), and the elimination and transfer of marketing positions at The CW Plus to the network's marketing department – resulted in the layoffs of around 25 to 30 employees.\n\nOn May 9, 2008, The CW announced that it would lease its Sunday lineup (then running from 5:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time) to production company Media Rights Capital (MRC). As Sundays have historically been a low-rated night for the network during its first two seasons on the air (due to stiff competition from CBS, ABC and Fox's strong Sunday lineups, and complicated further by NBC's acquisition of \"Sunday Night Football\" in September 2006, shortly before The CW debuted), the move allowed The CW to concentrate on its Monday through Saturday prime time schedule, while giving MRC the right to develop and schedule programs of its own choosing and reap advertising revenue generated by the lineup. The Sunday series that were scheduled – two reality series (\"4Real\" and \"In Harm's Way\") and two scripted series (romantic dramedy \"Valentine\" and drama \"Easy Money\") – performed poorly in the ratings (averaging only 1.04 million viewers), prompting The CW to scrap its agreement with MRC and program Sunday nights on its own starting on November 30, 2008. With no first-run programming available to run on Sundays as a backup, the network added reruns of \"The Drew Carey Show\" and \"Jericho\", and movies to replace the MRC-produced programs.\n\nOne of the shows carried over to the network from UPN, \"WWE Friday Night SmackDown\", ended its run on The CW after the September 26, 2008, episode due to negotiations ending between the WWE and The CW on renewing the program. Representatives for The CW later confirmed that it had chosen not to continue carrying \"SmackDown\" because the network had redefined its target audience as exclusively females 18 to 34 years old, whereas \"Smackdown\" targeted a predominately male audience – although it continued to air some shows that targeted male viewers afterward, such as \"Smallville\" and \"Supernatural\". Following \"Smackdown\"s move to MyNetworkTV that same season, the Fox-owned network (which launched the same month as The CW's debut, albeit two weeks earlier, on September 5, 2006) began beating The CW in the Friday ratings every week from that program's debut on the network, though The CW continued to beat MyNetworkTV overall.\n\nThe CW has generally struggled in the Nielsen ratings since its inception, primarily placing fifth in all statistics tabulated by Nielsen (total audience viewership and demographic ratings). On several occasions, The CW has even been outrated by Spanish language network Univision. This had led to speculation within the industry (including a May 16, 2008 article in \"The Wall Street Journal\") that CBS, Time Warner or both companies could abandon the venture if ratings did not improve. However, The CW's fortunes were buoyed in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 television seasons thanks to increased ratings among females in the 18–34 demographic and the buzz that some of its newer series (such as \"Gossip Girl\", \"90210\" and \"The Vampire Diaries\") had generated with audiences. Executives with CBS Corporation and Time Warner also emphasized their commitment to the network.\n\nOn May 5, 2009, The CW announced that it would give the five hours of network time on Sundays back to its affiliated stations that fall, effectively becoming a weeknight-only network in prime time, in addition to The CW Daytime and The CW4Kids blocks (the latter block, airing on Saturday mornings, would remain the only weekend programming supplied by the network). This, in turn, resulted in the discontinuance of the Sunday late afternoon repeat block that The CW inherited from The WB (formerly branded by that network as \"EasyView\") through its use of the predecessor network's scheduling model. Subsequently, in mid-May, 65% of The CW's affiliates, including those carrying The CW Plus, signed agreements to continue to air the replacement \"MGM Showcase\" movie package on Sundays, which was offered as a traditional syndicated film package meant for The CW's former prime time slot on that night.\n\nOn April 28, 2011, Mark Pedowitz was appointed by the network to succeed original president of entertainment Dawn Ostroff; Pedowitz assumed broader responsibilities in The CW's business operations than Ostroff had, as the network's first president. As president of entertainment, Ostroff oversaw entertainment operations while John Maatta, the network's chief operating officer, handled business affairs; both reported to a board composed of CBS and Warner Bros. executives. Maatta began reporting to Pedowitz as a result of the latter's appointment as network president. Pedowitz revealed that the core target demographic of the network would not change, though The CW would attempt to lure new viewers. Pedowitz began looking to bring comedies back to The CW after former president, Dawn Ostroff, publicly declared that the difficulty of developing comedies for its target demographic as the reason for their removal from the network following the 2008–09 season (with \"Everybody Hates Chris\", and \"The Game\" – a spin-off of \"Girlfriends\" – becoming the last comedies to be cancelled). The network also ordered more episodes of its original series and ran them consecutively through the first week of December, starting on September 12, without repeats. In July 2012, Pedowitz no longer referred to the target demographic of The CW as women 18-34, but rather that it would now be an \"18-34 adult network\".\n\nThe 2012–13 season saw the introduction of action-superhero series \"Arrow\" based on DC Comics' Green Arrow, which received favorable reviews from critics and became a hit with audiences when it premiered. As evidence of the network's refocusing toward a more inclusive audience, \"Arrow\" not only premiered to some of the highest viewership totals in the network's history (the third highest overall , behind the series premieres of \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"The Flash\"), it also gave the network its strongest performance in the demographic of males 18-34 since \"Smallville\" ended its run in May 2011. The strength of \"Arrow\", combined with the stability of \"The Vampire Diaries\" and a rejuvenated \"Supernatural\" gave The CW a much needed win for the season. However, the network's other creative swings in \"Emily Owens, M.D.\" and \"Cult\" were not successful and were canceled after one season, in addition, fan favorite, \"Gossip Girl\", ended after six seasons and once breakout hit 90210 was cancelled due to declining ratings. The remaining freshman lineup of \"Beauty & the Beast\" and \"The Carrie Diaries\" performed adequately enough for renewal. During this season, the network introduced an image campaign under the \"TV Now\" slogan, in part to emphasize the availability of CW content across television, computer and mobile platforms.\n\nThe 2013–14 season saw the network continue to build on its newfound stability with the introduction of \"The Vampire Diaries\" spin-off, \"The Originals\". Paired with \"Supernatural\", this combo led The CW to success on a new night. \"Arrow\" continued to perform strongly, however its new companion, the highly anticipated \"The Tomorrow People\" fizzled out and was canceled despite a promising start. Freshman period-piece \"Reign\" performed adequately enough to earn a renewal. Mid-season entry \"The 100\" proved to be a success, however fellow mid-season entry \"Star-Crossed\" did not fare as well and was canceled. The network finally found success with its summer programming in 2013, with the revival of the U.S. version of the improv comedy series \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\", which later became part of the network's fall-to-spring schedule.\n\nThe 2014–15 season saw the premieres of three critically acclaimed shows that also earned strong ratings: \"Arrow\" spin-off \"The Flash\", the freshman comedy-drama \"Jane the Virgin\" (loosely adapted from the Venezuelan telenovela \"Juana la Virgen\"), and freshman offbeat crime dramedy \"iZombie\" (a loose adaptation based on DC's Vertigo comic book series of the same name). \"The Flash\" surpassed \"The Vampire Dairies\" as the highest-rated premiere in the network's history and became the most watched show on the network. \"Jane the Virgin\", meanwhile, earned some of the highest critical praise of any series during the 2014–15 television season, and during its first season, became the first CW series ever to have been nominated for and win a Golden Globe Award (with lead actress Gina Rodriguez winning the Golden Globe for \"Best Actress in a Comedy or Variety Series\"). \"iZombie\", which premiered as a mid-season replacement, earned both strong ratings (at one point becoming the third highest-rated show on The CW) and critical acclaim. Overall, the network ended the 2014–15 season posting its highest average total viewership in a single television season since 2007–08 with 2.15 million viewers, a 12% increase in total viewership year-to-year; The CW also posted its highest seasonal demographic ratings among males ages 18–49 with a 0.8 share. The network's Summer 2015 schedule also saw the debut of \"Significant Mother\", the first original half-hour sitcom to air on The CW since 2009 (other scripted half-hour comedies have aired on the network since that time, consisting of imported series acquired by The CW through distribution deals with Canadian and British producers).\n\nThe 2015–16 season saw two shows that receive similar success: the freshman musical comedy-drama \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" and the \"Arrow/Flash\" spin-off \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow\". \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" became one of the most critically acclaimed shows of the season and became the second show on the network to be nominated and win a Golden Globe Award (with actress Rachel Bloom winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Variety Series); \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow\", meanwhile, earned high ratings for the network and became the most watched show on the network's Thursday night block in two years. On the other hand, \"Containment\" was cancelled following mixed reviews and falling ratings (although the series had been promoted as being a limited series).\n\nThe 2016–17 season saw mixed fortunes with CBS transplant \"Supergirl\" providing a boost to the lineup, while freshmen series \"Frequency\" and \"No Tomorrow\" failed to live up to ratings expectations and were canceled. Critically acclaimed freshman series \"Riverdale\" fared better, securing a renewal despite modest ratings. Long-running \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"Reign\" concluded their runs.\n\nThe 2017–18 season saw the success of new DC Comics entry \"Black Lightning\", but with little else as rookie entries \"Valor\" and \"Life Sentence\" were canceled after being met with dismal ratings. Soap reboot \"Dynasty\" was met with similarly dismal ratings, but was renewed thanks to lucrative off-network streaming deals struck with the show's producing studio and network co-owner, CBS. On February 14, 2018, The CW announced that it will add a 2-hour prime time block on Sunday nights beginning in Fall 2018, returning the network to Sundays for the first time since the lease to Media Rights Capital ended in 2009, as well as expanding The CW's prime time slate from 10 hours to 12. Discussions with CBS and Warner Bros. about the expansion began as early as July 2017; both gave their approval on the move that December, with the network reaching clearance deals with key affiliate partners in early 2018.\n\nOn June 12, 2018, AT&T received antitrust approval to acquire Warner Bros. parent Time Warner, which closed two days later and was renamed WarnerMedia, making AT&T a co-owner of The CW with CBS.\n\nThe CW airs its prime time programming for only two hours on Sunday through Friday evenings, compared to the three hours on Monday through Saturdays and four hours on Sunday nights programmed by the three longest-established networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC. This \"common prime\" scheduling (which was originated by Fox when it launched its prime time schedule in April 1987, and later adopted by CW predecessors The WB and UPN when they launched in January 1995) allows the option for affiliates to air either a local newscast, syndicated programming or both during the 10:00–11:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) time period. As with The WB and UPN, The CW does not run network programming on Saturday nights – even though it maintains a syndicated children's program block on Saturday mornings – allowing affiliates to run syndicated programs, sports, movies or network programs that were preempted from earlier in the week because of special programming carried by the station, in the 8:00–10:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific) time period (MyNetworkTV also does not carry any weekend prime time programming, having turned network time on Saturday evenings over to its affiliates in March 2007).\n\nThe CW is also tied with NBC (if its morning news program \"Today\" is not counted) for the fewest daytime hours programmed by any of the major broadcast networks, running only one hour of programming each weekday afternoon (compared to 4 daytime hours on CBS and three hours on ABC). The CW, unlike the \"Big Four\" broadcast networks, also does not air any national newscasts, network-supplied sports, or late-night programming.\n\nBecause of these factors, The CW's affiliates handle the responsibility of programming non-network time periods, with the majority of its stations filling those slots mainly with syndicated programming. However, some of the network's affiliates broadcast their own local news and/or sports programs (either produced by the station itself or through outsourcing agreements with an affiliate of another network). Many affiliates also carry telecasts of basketball, football and in some cases, other collegiate sporting events (such as baseball or hockey) that are produced by syndicators such as American Sports Network and Raycom Sports, while a few (mainly those owned by Tribune Broadcasting, such as former Chicago affiliate WGN-TV) carry games from local teams of major professional sports leagues such as Major League Baseball and the NBA.\n\n, The CW currently provides 20 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week, over the course of seven days. The network provides twelve hours of prime time programming to its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations on Sunday through Fridays from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Outside of prime time, an hour of daytime programming is also offered Monday through Fridays from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. in all time zones, in the form of tabloid talk show \"The Jerry Springer Show\" (though a few affiliates – such as WPIX in New York City, WPWR-TV in Chicago, KDAF in Dallas-Fort Worth, KPXJ in Shreveport and WCCB in Charlotte – carry the show earlier in the afternoon); also, a three-hour educational programming block called \"One Magnificent Morning\" (which airs as part of the CW schedule through a time-lease agreement with Litton Entertainment) airs on Saturday mornings from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. in all time zones.\n\nThe weekday daytime hour provided by the network and the Litton-produced Saturday morning block (the latter of which is subject to scheduling variances similar to the weekday hour in some markets, such as in Atlanta and San Diego) are designed to be tape delayed and are therefore recommended to air in the same time slot in all time zones, though both are broadcast one hour earlier on affiliates of The CW Plus in the Central, Mountain and Alaska Time Zones. In Guam, CW Plus affiliate KTKB-LD in Hagåtña airs the CW schedule day and date on a one-day tape delay from its initial broadcast because of the time difference between Guam and the continental United States as the island is on the west side of the International Date Line. As of 2018, \"Supernatural\" (which originally aired on The WB) is the only CW series carried over from either of the network's respective predecessors that continues to be broadcast on the network.\n\nThe CW formerly aired short segments during commercial breaks within certain episodes of its programs known as \"Content Wraps\" – a play on the network's name – in order to advertise one company's product during part or the entirety of a commercial break. The entertainment magazine series \"CW Now\" was inspired in part by the success of the Content Wraps as it was intended to be a series with product placement; the program was cancelled in 2008, after a single 23-episode season. For the 2006–07 season, The CW reached an agreement with American Eagle Outfitters to incorporate tie-ins with the company's aerie clothing line as part of the Content Wrap concept within the network's Tuesday night schedule, which included subjects in the commercials commenting on plot points in each of the shows. The agreement was cut down to regular advertising in February 2007, after a fan backlash by viewers of both shows and general criticism of the campaign.\n\nThe CW does not produce any national news content, and the majority of its affiliates do not have their own autonomous news operations. , the network currently has only four affiliates that produce their own local news programming, all of which were carry-overs from previous affiliations: WPIX in New York City and KTLA in Los Angeles started their news departments as independent stations and/or during early affiliations with other networks including DuMont; WCCB in Charlotte, North Carolina started its news operation as a Fox affiliate; and WISH-TV in Indianapolis (which became a CW affiliate on January 1, 2015) started its news operation as an ABC affiliate before affiliating with CBS in 1956. KTLA has the largest number of weekly hours devoted to local news programming of any CW affiliate with 78¾ hours of scheduled news each week.\n\nEight other CW-affiliated stations maintained in-house news operations, but have since disaffiliated from the network or discontinued in-house production:\n\nNews programming on CW affiliates – if the station carries any – is often outsourced to another major network affiliate in the market, especially if they are operated as part of a duopoly or management agreement, such as Tribune's respective CW-Fox duopolies of KWGN-TV/KDVR in Denver and KPLR-TV/KTVI in St. Louis (the Fox stations in both duopolies – KDVR and KTVI – were formerly owned by Local TV, with Tribune-owned KWGN and KPLR respectively consolidating with those stations through local marketing agreements formed as part of a wider partnership involving Local TV, which Tribune bought outright in 2013); Evansville, Indiana affiliate WTVW (which joined The CW in January 2013) and ABC affiliate WEHT (a virtual duopoly formed through Nexstar Broadcasting Group's 2011 purchase of WEHT and trade of WTVW to partner group Mission Broadcasting); and the CW-CBS O&O duopoly of KMAX-TV/KOVR in Sacramento (the former of which has produced a morning newscast, \"Good Day Sacramento\", since it was a UPN owned-and-operated station, and – despite the two becoming a duopoly in 2005 – has remained separate from a more traditional morning show on KOVR pre-\"CBS This Morning\", which produces KMAX's evening newscast).\n\nThe scheduling of news programming on The CW's affiliates often mirrors that of Fox stations, with morning newscasts (designed to compete with the national morning shows on ABC, CBS and NBC within the 7:00–9:00 a.m. timeslot; in duopolies, these are typically an extension of a sister station's morning newscast) and a prime time newscast within the 10:00–11:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific (9:00–10:00 p.m. Central/Mountain) time slot. Rarely (but more common on the few major-market CW affiliates with in-house news departments), they may also include midday and/or early evening newscasts, including the network newscast slot of 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nOn September 23, 2006, the \"Kids' WB\" children's programming block – which originated on The WB in September 1995 and continued to be produced by Warner Bros. Television – was carried over to The CW as part of its inaugural programming lineup; although the network on which it originated ceased operations the week before, the \"Kids' WB\" branding was retained for the block. On October 2, 2007, through a joint decision between corporate parents Warner Bros. Television and CBS Corporation, The CW announced that it would discontinue the \"Kids' WB\" block due to competition from cable channels aimed at the demographic (such as Cartoon Network, which carried many series shared with the block and vice versa, Nickelodeon and Disney Channel), as well as the effects of children's advertising limits, and would sell the programming rights to the network's Saturday morning block to 4Kids Entertainment (which at the time of the announcement, had produced a competing children's programming block, \"4Kids TV\", for Fox). \"Kids' WB\" ended its run on May 17, 2008 (though some CW affiliates that delayed the block to Sundays, such as Atlanta O&O WUPA, aired the block for the last time on May 18).\n\nThe following week on May 24, 4Kids took over responsibility for The CW's Saturday morning children's lineup, with the debut of a new block called \"The CW4Kids\". The block's lineup initially consisted mostly of programs carried over from \"Kids' WB\", before eventually adding 4Kids-produced shows such as \"Chaotic\" as well as new seasons of \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" and \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\". The block was rebranded into \"Toonzai\" on August 14, 2010 (though The CW4Kids name was retained as a sub-brand to fulfill branding obligations that the network had to comply with per 4Kids Entertainment's contract to lease The CW's Saturday morning timeslots); \"Toonzai\" ended its run on August 18, 2012.\n\nOn July 3, 2012, Saban Brands and Kidsco Media Ventures, affiliates of Saban Capital Group, entered into an agreement to program the five-hour Saturday morning time slot with a new action-adventure and comedy programming block for The CW. TheCW4Kids/Toonzai was replaced by \"Vortexx\" on August 25, 2012, featuring programs such as \"Power Rangers Lost Galaxy\" and \"WWE Saturday Morning Slam\", the latter of which marked the return of WWE programming to the network since \"WWE Smackdown\" moved to MyNetworkTV in 2008.\n\nOn June 5, 2014, The CW announced an agreement with Litton Entertainment to program a block of live-action series designed to comply with the FCC's educational programming guidelines. Vortexx (which was the last remaining non-educational children's block on the major U.S. broadcast networks) was replaced by \"One Magnificent Morning\" on October 4, 2014. The block features a mix of wildlife and lifestyle-themed programs, similar in vein to those featured on the Litton-produced blocks aired by ABC and CW sister network CBS (one of its initial programs, \"Expedition Wild\", was moved over to \"One Magnificent Morning\" from the ABC block; while one of the CW block's early entries, \"Rock the Park\", moved to \"Litton's Weekend Adventure\" after one season). On January 7, 2016, The CW and Litton announced a five-year renewal for the block, extending it through the 2020–21 broadcast season. Starting with the 2017–18 broadcast season, the block's running time was reduced to three hours and began airing from 8:00am to 11:00am. The CW returned the two hours of reclaimed time to the affiliates.\n\n, The CW has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 209 additional television stations encompassing 46 states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. possessions. Counting only conventional CW affiliates and over-the-air affiliates of The CW Plus, the network has an estimated combined national reach of 100% of all households in the United States (or 323,107,367 Americans with at least one television set); this makes The CW the largest U.S. broadcast network by population reach percentage. As of January 2016, four U.S. states (Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Vermont) lack a locally licensed CW affiliate, largely due to a lack of a need for a local affiliate as those states are located within the broadcast ranges of stations in nearby states. Delaware is served by Philadelphia O&O WPSG and Salisbury, Maryland affiliate WMDT-DT2, while New Hampshire and Vermont are each served by four CW stations based in surrounding states (including Boston affiliate WLVI). New Jersey is served by WPSG and New York City affiliate WPIX.\n\nAs a newer broadcast network, The CW maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Reno, Nevada (KRNS-CD) and Boise, Idaho (KYUU-LD). In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. The CW also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets and receive the network's programming via The CW Plus; the largest subchannel-only CW affiliate by market size, as of May 31, 2017, is KFMB-TV DT2 in San Diego, California.\n\nCurrently, the Sinclair Broadcast Group is the largest operator of CW stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 24 CW-affiliated stations, nine subchannel-only affiliates and one cable-only affiliate, covering 17% of all U.S. television markets; Tribune Broadcasting is the largest operator of CW stations in terms of overall market reach, owning or providing services to thirteen CW stations (including its three largest affiliates in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago), covering 28% of the U.S.\n\nOn the day of the network launch announcement, The CW immediately announced it had reached ten-year affiliation agreements with Tribune Broadcasting and CBS Television Stations. Tribune originally committed 16 stations that were previously affiliated with The WB (including its flagship broadcast stations WGN-TV in Chicago, KTLA in Los Angeles and WPIX in New York City; another committed station, KSWB-TV in San Diego, joined Fox in August 2008, and two others, WLVI-TV in Boston and WCWN in Albany, New York were respectively sold by Tribune to Sunbeam Television and Freedom Communications shortly after the network launched), while CBS committed 11 of its UPN stations (including WKBD in Detroit, WPSG in Philadelphia, KBHK-TV (now KBCW) in San Francisco and WUPA in Atlanta). These stations combined to reach 48% of all television households in the United States. Both companies also owned several UPN and WB-affiliated stations that did not join The CW in overlapping markets (such as Seattle, Philadelphia and Dallas). As part of its affiliation agreement with the network, the Tribune Company agreed to divest its ownership interest in The WB (a move it made partly to avoid shouldering shutdown costs for The WB) and did not acquire an equity stake in The CW.\n\nThe network stated that it would eventually reach 95% of all U.S. television households. In markets where separate affiliates of both UPN and The WB operated, only one station became a CW affiliate. Executives were on record as preferring the \"strongest\" stations among The WB and UPN's existing affiliates. As one example, the new network's first affiliate outside the core group of Tribune and CBS-owned stations, WJZY in Charlotte (which was later acquired by Fox Television Stations and converted into a Fox O&O in July 2013), was tied with Atlanta O&O WUPA as UPN's fifth highest-rated station. In most cases, it was obvious where the new network would affiliate; there were only a few markets (such as Philadelphia, Miami–Fort Lauderdale, Boston, Charlotte and Atlanta) where the WB and UPN affiliates were both relatively strong in terms of local overall viewership. For example, one of the earliest affiliates to be announced outside the core group, WKCF in Orlando, Florida, had not only been The WB's highest-rated affiliate for the virtual entirety of that network's run, but had also been the fourth highest-rated television station in Central Florida.\n\nNearly all of The CW's affiliates were formerly affiliated with UPN or The WB, with very few having been independent stations or affiliates of other networks prior to joining the network; a notable exception was Las Vegas affiliate KVCW, which had been a fairly successful independent before joining The CW. Although it was generally understood that The CW was a merger of UPN and The WB, the new network's creation was not structured as a merger in the legal sense. Rather, it was one new network launching at the same time that two others shut down, although it did assume certain programming content, operations and management from its predecessors. As such, The CW was not obligated by existing affiliations with The WB and UPN; it had to negotiate from scratch with individual stations. As a result, in several markets, the CW affiliation is on a local station different from either the former WB and UPN stations (for example, the CW affiliation in Las Vegas ended up on KVCW, instead of former WB affiliate KVMY or now-defunct former UPN affiliate KTUD-CA). The network has also affiliated with some digital subchannels, usually those launched by a local Big Four affiliate as a new service, in several other markets – especially if fewer than six commercial television stations existed at the time of affiliation, requiring The CW to carry its programming on a subchannel by default (for example, The CW opted to affiliate with a subchannel of WKRC-TV in Cincinnati – which has only five commercial full-power stations – instead of former WB affiliate WSTR-TV, which instead became an affiliate of MyNetworkTV).\n\nBecause of the availability of \"instant duopoly\" digital subchannels that will likely be easily available on cable and satellite, and the overall lack of a need to settle for a secondary affiliation with shows aired in problematic timeslots that would subject the timeshifted programs to lower average viewership in certain markets, both The CW and MyNetworkTV launched with far greater national coverage than that enjoyed by UPN and The WB when they both launched in January 1995. UPN, for several years, had affiliation gaps in the top 30 markets, and by 2005 managed to cover only 86% of the country. This resulted in secondary affiliations with other networks and the resulting diluted ratings when programs were shown out of their intended timeslots, or the lack of the program airing at all (a problem experienced by many fans of the \"Star Trek\" franchise with \"\" and \"\").\n\nThe announcement of The CW caused the largest single shakeup in U.S. broadcast television since the affiliation alliance between Fox and New World Communications in 1994 (as well as a separate alliance with Burnham Broadcasting that began a year later) and the subsequent launches of UPN and The WB the following year. While The CW's debut affected more markets, it likely did not cause the same degree of viewer confusion, as no affiliates of the four major networks dropped those affiliations to join The CW (some \"Big Four\" affiliations did change at this time, but for unrelated reasons). The WB and UPN were the first major television networks to shut down since the collapse of the DuMont Television Network in August 1955, although other small broadcast television networks have also ceased operations over the years.\n\nIt became clear that Fox Television Stations, which purchased several UPN-affiliated stations from that network's former co-owner Chris-Craft Industries in 2002, would be affected. Its UPN affiliates in five major markets (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Houston) did not receive affiliations with The CW, due to the agreement with Tribune, and Fox made it clear it would not even seek carriage of the network for its UPN stations in four other markets. All network logos and references were quickly removed from Fox's UPN stations. Shortly thereafter, Fox parent News Corporation (which spun off its American media and entertainment properties into 21st Century Fox as part of the company's July 2013 corporate separation) announced that it would launch MyNetworkTV, a programming service meant to fill the two nightly prime time hours that UPN would vacate on the network's Fox-owned affiliates after The CW launched. Fox also offered the service to stations owned by other broadcasting groups.\n\nIn markets where The WB and UPN were carried on separate stations, one of the two local outlets was left out in the merger; most of the stations that did not join The CW had signed affiliation agreements with MyNetworkTV instead, while others elected to become independent stations. Some stations (mainly digital subchannels, some cable channels that were formerly part of The WB 100+ Station Group, and struggling low-power stations) which did not affiliate with either network opted instead to shut down permanently.\n\nLike its predecessors UPN and by technicality, The WB (as none of Tribune Broadcasting's WB stations were considered to be O&Os since Time Warner held majority ownership of that network), The CW does not have owned-and-operated stations in any of the three largest U.S. television markets – New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. The network's largest owned-and-operated station is CBS-owned WPSG in Philadelphia, which also became UPN's largest O&O after Chris-Craft Industries (which sold most of its UPN stations, including its affiliates in New York City and Los Angeles, to Fox Television Stations in 2001) had its ownership stake in that network acquired by Viacom in March 2000 (neither UPN nor the DuMont Television Network had an O&O in Chicago at all; a similar situation arose with DuMont's O&O in Los Angeles, present-day CW affiliate KTLA – which had disaffiliated from the network in 1948 shortly after the FCC ruled that it and WDTV in Pittsburgh (now KDKA-TV, a CW corporate cousin through CBS Corporation), to be O&Os through their then-owner Paramount Pictures' voting stock interest in DuMont).\n\nBecause Tribune Broadcasting does not maintain an ownership stake in The CW, its stations in the two respective top markets (WPIX and KTLA) are actually \"affiliates\" of the network; CBS Corporation owns secondary stations – both independents – in two of the three markets, KCAL-TV in Los Angeles and WLNY-TV in the New York City market (however, while KCAL was owned by CBS at the network's launch, WLNY was not acquired by CBS until 2011; neither station carries CW programming, though, because of the network's affiliation deals with Tribune-owned stations in those markets, and in the latter case, WLNY's over-the-air signal does not serve the entire New York City market – resulting in most residents in the metropolitan area receiving the station mainly through cable or satellite – due to being licensed to the Long Island community of Riverhead, restricting its transmitter from being located more than from its city of license under FCC regulations). Unlike with The WB and UPN (the latter network's founding owners, Chris-Craft and Viacom, both had their own station groups that formed UPN's core stations at its launch), only one of The CW's co-owners – CBS Corporation – maintains ownership of the network's owned-and-operated stations (since the summer 2017 sale of WPCH-TV/Atlanta, Time Warner holds no over-the-air assets whatsoever).\n\nUnlike the other major networks, The CW distributes its programming in small and certain mid-sized markets throughout the United States (generally those ranked among the bottom 110 Nielsen media markets) through The CW Plus, a separate national feed that is carried on a mixture of full-power and low-power stations in some markets, and cable-only outlets and digital subchannel affiliations on major network stations in markets that do not have enough commercial stations to support a standalone CW affiliate (several of The CW Plus's digital subchannel outlets originally operated as cable-only affiliates at the network's launch). The service offers its own master schedule of syndicated and brokered programming acquired by the network (including some feature films and infomercials) during non-network programming hours, although some CW Plus affiliates may also run local newscasts produced by a major network affiliate.\n\nCW predecessor The WB previously had two cable-only affiliate outlets: WGN America, the national superstation feed of WGN-TV at the time, from January 1995 to October 1999 and network-operated The WB 100+ Station Group (the direct predecessor to The CW Plus), which was formed in September 1998 and had several of its cable-only outlets join The CW Plus at the CW network's launch. Not all of the network's cable-only affiliates were CW Plus outlets, WT05 in Toledo, Ohio offered its own schedule of syndicated programs during non-network hours that was programmed by its then-owner Block Communications, which also operates that market's major cable provider Buckeye CableSystem (WT05 now exists as \"CW13,\" having been converted into a digital subchannel of Gray Television-owned ABC affiliate WTVG in October 2014). Though The CW is the only network with a station group that includes cable-only outlets, it is actually one of only three networks that have had cable-only stations within its affiliate body (ABC formerly had a cable-only affiliate in Winchester, Virginia-based TV3 Winchester until Gray shut the channel down in December 2013).\n\nWhen The CW launched in September 2006, the network began branding most of its affiliates using a combination of \"CW\" or \"The CW\", and at the affiliate's choice, either the station's channel number (for example, Nashville affiliate WNAB is branded as \"CW58\" and Seattle O&O KSTW brands as \"CW11\") or the name of the city or region it serves. Examples of the latter include Philadelphia O&O WPSG (known as \"The CW Philly 57\" as an homage to its prior branding as an independent station), WLVI (known at launch as \"Boston's CW\", though it rebranded to \"CW56\" after being sold to Sunbeam Television), WUPA (known as \"CW Atlanta\" at launch, but is now known as \"CW69\"), Waco, Texas subchannel affiliate KWTX-DT2 (known as \"CW Texas\") and KVCW (branded as \"CW Las Vegas\"). Some stations also use the call sign either within the station logo, in on-air identification or both; examples include WNLO/Buffalo, New York and WWHO/Columbus, Ohio (WBNX/Cleveland formerly also did so until their affiliation was terminated in July 2018).\n\nIn Omaha, Nebraska, KXVO uses the dual brandings of \"CW15\" and \"Omaha's CW\". In Honolulu, Hawaii, KHON-DT2 was originally branded as \"Hawaii's CW 93\" (the \"93\" refers to the subchannel's cable channel position on Oceanic Time Warner Cable), before it was shortened to \"Hawaii's CW\" in September 2014. The branding once used by WKRC-DT2/Cincinnati, Ohio was \"CinCW\", a portmanteau with the common nickname for the city, \"Cincy\" (it now brands as \"The CW Cincinnati\"). With the exceptions of WXCW/Fort Myers and (to a somewhat lesser extent) XETV/San Diego, all CW affiliates not owned by Tribune usually brand themselves using a version of the network logo. Mobile, Alabama CW affiliate WBPG, then known as \"The Gulf Coast's CW\" changed its call letters to WFNA in December 2009 and used a similar approach around their new call letters, before becoming known as \"CW 55\" in September 2012 and adopting a style reflective of The CW's branding techniques once again. WISH-TV in Indianapolis, as it had during its CBS affiliation, continues to brand solely with its channel number and calls as \"WISH-TV 8\", with \"The CW\" appended where appropriate, usually only in print and radio advertising.\n\nSome Time Warner Cable subscribers around the country were unable to watch CW programming when the network debuted, as stations in several markets were not able to reach carriage deals with the provider to distribute the local affiliates. In markets like Charleston, South Carolina; El Paso, Texas; Honolulu, Hawaii; Palm Springs, California; Beaumont; Waco and Corpus Christi, Texas, where The CW is broadcast on a digital subchannel of one of the market's major network affiliates, there were unsuccessful attempts in getting Time Warner Cable to carry the subchannel affiliates (CW co-parent Time Warner had owned Time Warner Cable until it spun off the provider into a separate company in 2009).\n\nSome affiliates eventually signed carriage deals with Time Warner Cable, but not all of the CW affiliates received carriage on the provider's basic cable tiers (for example, Syracuse, New York affiliate WSTQ-LP can only be viewed on digital cable channel 266 in the Ithaca market). Currently, the largest market without a known affiliate is the Johnstown–Altoona market, whose closest CW station is CBS-owned WPCW/Pittsburgh, which is carried on TWC's Johnstown and Altoona area systems; WPCW was originally targeted to serve that area before it refocused its programming toward the Pittsburgh market in the late 1990s.\n\nOn February 2, 2007, Beaumont, Texas CBS station KFDM made its CW-affiliated subchannel available to Time Warner Cable customers in the market on channel 10. On April 20, 2007, ABC affiliate KVIA-TV in El Paso, Texas began broadcasting its CW-affiliated subchannel on Time Warner Cable channel 13. On April 21, 2007, KCWQ-LP made its broadcast debut on channel 5 on Time Warner Cable in the Palm Springs area.\n\nOne of the network's major affiliate groups, Pappas Telecasting Companies, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for thirteen of its television stations on May 10, 2008. Within the petition, Pappas specifically cited the network's low ratings and lackluster performance as one of many complications that had forced it to make the filing. Several of the stations have since been sold either in business transactions with representatives involved in Pappas's bankruptcy proceedings or via station auction processes as the company winds down operations.\n\nAlthough Pappas had originally stated that none of its stations would be affected at all by the closing, two stations owned by the company that were formerly affiliated with The CW have ceased operations. On May 29, 2008, Yakima, Washington affiliate KCWK (which served the south-central portion of that state) shut down and the station's offices were closed, leaving that area without locally based CW programming and forcing cable and satellite providers to carry Los Angeles affiliate KTLA in order to provide the network's programming to their subscribers. The situation was resolved in April 2009, when Fisher Communications announced that its CBS affiliates in the area, KIMA-TV and satellite station KEPR-TV, would carry the network through digital subchannel affiliations.\n\nSubsequently, WLGA in Columbus, Georgia lost its CW affiliation in April 2009 to a subchannel of NBC affiliate WLTZ because of the network's concerns about Pappas' financial state; WLGA ultimately ceased operations in June 2010 as it was unable to compete in the market as an independent station; it later resumed operations in August 2012, as an affiliate of WeatherNation TV (it is now an Antenna TV affiliate).\n\nMarianas Media signed on KTKB-LD in Hagåtña, Guam as a CW affiliate on April 20, 2009, becoming the U.S. territory's fifth commercial television outlet. However, competition from other stations in the island combined with financial problems at Marianas, which was running the station under a local marketing agreement with the troubled KM Communications Inc., forced the station off the air on March 31, 2011. The station resumed operations the following year.\n\nWhile Tribune Media has solid affiliation deals with The CW on several of its stations, it also maintains a strong affiliation alliance with Fox. But with new management and ownership taking over Tribune in 2008, it was apparent that the company would switch one of its CW-affiliated stations to Fox (at least those in markets without a Fox owned-and-operated station or a former O&O that was acquired by Local TV, which Tribune later acquired in 2013), adding to more questions surrounding The CW's future. In a March 2008 seminar by Tribune's then-chairman and CEO Sam Zell, it was revealed that the company's San Diego outlet KSWB-TV would switch its affiliation from The CW to Fox that August, with KSWB assuming the Fox affiliation from XETV-TV, which had been a Fox charter affiliate since that network's October 1986 inception. XETV (which is licensed to Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico under the ownership of Grupo Televisa but whose U.S. operations are programmed by Bay City Television) was not informed of Zell's deal until it was made public.\n\nAfter the news broke, XETV planned on suing to prevent the switch on the grounds that it would violate an affiliation contract that XETV had with Fox that was not set to expire until 2010. However, on July 2, 2008, XETV announced that it would join The CW on August 1 (the same day that KSWB became a Fox affiliate) and rebrand as \"San Diego 6\". Though twelve of Tribune's thirteen other CW-affiliated stations have remained with the network, all of them began to de-emphasize the network from their branding (e.g., \"CW 11\") in favor of one with a stronger local identity. On-air branding that excised the CW name began being implemented by the stations in July 2008, either on-air (in the case of KWGN-TV) or through their websites (as part of a redesign for all of the Tribune stations' websites). Some of these stations eventually began reincorporating the CW branding starting in 2011, such as KDAF/Dallas, KIAH/Houston and KRCW-TV/Portland, Oregon.\n\nTribune Company president and CEO Peter Liguori said in a May 2014 discussion at the MoffettNathanson Media & Communications Summit that he was \"not pleased with where the CW is [in regards to its ratings performance],\" stating that the network \"should not program to [young] people who don't watch [conventional] television.\" Liguori also stated that he would consider collaborating with the network in regards to improving its programming slate, possibly by incorporating programs from the company's Tribune Studios unit (a production division which launched shortly after Liguori was appointed president of Tribune in November 2013) onto the network, as well as having Tribune play a larger role in The CW's management.\n\nSpeaking at Goldman Sachs' 23rd Annual Communacopia Conference in September 2014, Les Moonves acknowledged that Tribune had been looking for more input in how the network is programmed and noted that Liguori is a former programmer (having previously served in executive roles at Fox, FX and Discovery Communications), saying that \"[Liguori] would like to participate. He has some good ideas. He's part of our team. Will there be some change in how the CW is structured going forward? I don't know.\" Moonves went on to reiterate that Tribune is \"a very important part of [CBS'] future\" (considering that Tribune had recently acquired the CBS affiliation for its Indianapolis station and then-CW affiliate WTTV, following disagreements between CBS and longtime affiliate WISH-TV, which would eventually take over the CW affiliation in January 2015, over reverse compensation demands by the network).\n\nIn an October 2014 interview with \"Broadcasting & Cable\", Liguori appeared to reverse course on his previous statements and spoke of Tribune's support of the network. Liguori said in a statement, \"We are very encouraged by the recent uptick in The CW['s] ratings and the positive critical response to the new primetime lineup. In particular, [CW CEO Mark Pedowitz] has put in place a programming strategy that will help the network appeal to a wider, more inclusive audience, which is important for our stations across the country. We were glad to support the launch of the new shows through editorial and promotional initiatives, and we look forward to more continued collaboration to build upon this momentum.\"\n\nIn January 2016, The CW and Tribune began negotiations on a new affiliation deal, as the original 10-year agreement signed at the network's inception was approaching its end. Complicating matters was the desire by The CW's parent companies, CBS and Warner Bros., to stream the network's programming as a standalone pay OTT service. The impasse in negotiations resulted in a months-long standoff between the two groups.\n\nOn May 23, 2016, The CW and Tribune announced they had come to a new affiliation agreement. As part of the deal, Tribune's Chicago flagship WGN-TV would leave the network and revert to being an independent station after nearly 21 years of being affiliated with The CW and its predecessor network, The WB. A major factor in this decision is WGN-TV's large use of local sports programming, which led to many pre-emptions of the CW while WGN-TV has had to move as many as 30 games a year to another local station in Chicago. The CW affiliation moved to WPWR-TV, a Fox Television Stations-owned MyNetworkTV station.\n\nRoberts Broadcasting filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on October 7, 2011; the company cited the loss of the UPN affiliations on its stations in St. Louis (WRBU), Columbia, South Carolina (WZRB) and Jackson, Mississippi (WRBJ-TV) when that network shut down in favor of The CW in 2006, as much of UPN's programming consisted of minority-targeted programs that Roberts felt were compatible with their stations' target audiences (though the stations have since recovered from this setback; additionally, its station in Evansville, Indiana, WAZE-TV, had instead affiliated with The WB prior to 2006, as it was owned by South Central Communications until February 2007). The company had also been hit with lawsuits from Warner Bros. Television, Twentieth Television and CBS Television Distribution over its failure to pay fees for syndicated programming; Roberts eventually settled with Twentieth but lost the Warner Bros. and CBS cases.\n\nOn March 24, 2011, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) canceled WAZE's license for Roberts' failure to construct its digital transmitter facilities. However, the station continued to broadcast via its three-station analog translator network.\n\nOn February 20, 2012, Roberts Broadcasting announced that it was exploring the possibility of selling one or all four of its television stations in order to raise enough cash to pay off its creditors. On October 22, 2012, Roberts announced that it had sold WRBJ to the Trinity Broadcasting Network; the deal was approved by a bankruptcy court on January 17, 2013, with TBN officially taking over operational control of WRBJ five months later on May 24 (The CW would return to the Jackson market on the second digital subchannel of CBS affiliate WJTV in September 2013). On January 3, 2013, the repeater network of WAZE ceased operations; later that month on January 28, independent station WTVW hurriedly joined The CW, in order to maintain the network in the Evansville area.\n\nOn December 2, 2013, Roberts filed to sell WZRB to Radiant Light Ministries, a subsidiary of Tri-State Christian Television, for $2 million. On December 4, Roberts also filed to sell WRBU to TCT for $5.5 million. However, on December 11, the United States bankruptcy court gave initial approval for a plan by Roberts's creditors to instead transfer WRBU, WZRB and the WAZE repeaters to a trust with Ion Media Networks (a creditor in Roberts's chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings) as its beneficiary, with Roberts' attorney subsequently stating that Ion would purchase the stations for $7.75 million. Roberts had earlier proposed an alternate plan that would have had only the WAZE repeaters be transferred to the trust, which would have allowed the sale of WRBU and WZRB to TCT. The CW affiliation in Columbia moved to WKTC (with MyNetworkTV, which the station had already been affiliated with, being relegated to a secondary affiliation) in March 2014, after temporarily remaining on WZRB after its conversion into an Ion Television O&O the previous month.\n\nThe CW provides video on demand access for delayed viewing of full episodes of the network's programming through various means, including via its website at CWTV.com and its mobile app for iOS and Android devices (with programs streamable over 3G and WiFi networks), a traditional VOD service – called The CW on Demand – that is available on most traditional cable and IPTV providers, and through content deals with Hulu, iTunes and Netflix.\n\nOn January 14, 2007, The CW began streaming full-length episodes of several of its programs on the CWTV.com website. The most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on The CW app and The CW on Demand the day after their original broadcast. However, due to restrictions imposed through its deal with the streaming service, streaming of the most recent episode of any CW program on Hulu is restricted until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) viewing, with day-after-air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of Hulu's subscription service. The CW previously imposed a three-day delay after an episode's original airdate before making its programs available on its website and through the Hulu subscription service (then known as Hulu Plus). However, changes implemented by the network on March 15, 2012 in an effort to reduce copyright infringement of its programming content through illegal streaming and downloading internet platforms resulted in that delay being reduced to eight hours after a program's original airing through both services. Like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks, The CW on Demand disables fast forwarding for content provided through the service.\n\nOn October 13, 2011, the network entered into digital distribution deals with streaming services Netflix and Hulu. The four-year Netflix agreement allows its customers to instantly watch more than 700 hours of previous seasons of The CW's current scripted series, while Hulu inked a five-year deal, giving the streaming site access to next-day content from four of the five major networks (with the exception of CW sister network CBS).\n\nOn October 24, 2012, The CW entered into its first video-on-demand distribution deal with a pay television provider through an agreement with Comcast that allows customers to watch the four most-recent episodes of the network's primetime shows on the cable provider's Xfinity On Demand service, along with next-day episode content. The CW On Demand, which is accessible to subscribers at no additional charge, debuted on Comcast Xfinity systems nationwide on October 25.\n\nThe CW's master feed is transmitted in 1080i high definition, with all transmission of the network's programming moving to the format in June 2012. All of the network's prime time programming has been presented in HD since March 2012 (when \"America's Next Top Model\" became the final CW program to convert to the format), with the exception of certain specials produced prior to that point (such as \"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\", a holiday special carried over to the network from The WB) and select movie presentations. The network's Saturday morning E/I block, One Magnificent Morning, is also broadcast in HD, with the final SD program, the two-season daytime talk show \"The Robert Irvine Show\" converting to the format for its second to last season in September 2017 (and in turn ending American broadcast network television's standard definition age).\n\nThe network is available in HD on most of its full-power affiliates, while availability of high definition content on subchannel-only or cable-exclusive affiliates varies by market; in some of these cases, the over-the-air signal is available only in standard definition (a widescreen feed transmitted in 480i SD is presented on some over-the-air affiliates to meet minimum requirements for presentation), with the station offering an exclusive high definition feed to cable and satellite providers. Some affiliates transmit CW programming in 720p HD due to technical considerations if the network is carried on a digital subchannel of a station affiliated with another major network or if a primary feed CW affiliate carries more than one subchannel. Since June 2012, The CW Plus feed is also transmitted in HD, and the network has asked those affiliates to carry it in high definition wherever possible.\n\nWith CBS beginning to use framing for all of their graphics on September 24, 2018, The CW is currently the last major network that continues to use 4:3 framing for all graphics.\n\nCW Seed (originally called CWD or the CW Digital Studio) is a production arm that provides original content created exclusively for digital platforms focused in the areas of animation, game shows, comedy and digital personalities. Included in the service is interactivity, feedback from viewers, and social engagement. Previously existing as a section on The CW's main website, CW Seed was spun-off to a separate website (cwseed.com) in 2014. Original web series produced by CW Seed includes \"Stupid Hype\", \"I Ship It\", \"How to Be a Vampire\", \"JoJoHead\", \"Prom Queen\", \"Husbands\", and the Arrowverse series \"Vixen\", \"\", and \"\". In addition, CW Seed hosts archive programming including shows such as \"Birds of Prey\", \"Hellcats\", \"Forever\", \"Everwood\", \"Dynasty\", \"Pushing Daisies\", \"Everybody Hates Chris\", and \"Max Headroom\".\n\n\n"}

In February 2017 Days of wonder abandoned Linux support.\n\nGameplay is identical to the board game: there are two types of cards, colored train cars representing a type of cargo (e.g., black represents coal cars), and destination cards which feature two city destinations (e.g., Chicago to Miami). Each player is dealt three destination cards, and must choose at least two of them. They are also dealt six train cards.\n\nPlayers may draw train cards, a new destination card, or claim a colored route on their turn. To claim a route, a player must pay with a combination of same-colored cards including locomotives which serve as wild cards. Once a route is claimed, no other player may claim it; some routes feature double routes which allow up to two players to claim it, but only if four or five players are playing. In two or three-player games, the double routes can only be claimed by one person. The players immediately earn points for each successful route they claim. At the end of the game, players earn the points listed on the destination card. If a player decides to pick a new destination card, he draws three cards and may choose any of the cards; however, the player \"must\" pick at least one destination.\n\nThe game ends when at least one of the players has expended their trains. Players are given bonuses for completed destinations, and penalized for unrealized destinations.

The primary mandate of these four organizations is to:\n\n\nThe primary mission of the Western Coating Societies (WCS) is to promote education activities and the interchange of ideas among its members and the public and to arrange for the collection and dissemination of information pertinent to the industries served by WCS, .including but not limited to paints, coatings, inks, adhesives, varnishes, and other related fields.\n\nIn the early 1950s, three groups known as the Golden Gate Paint and Varnish Production Club, the Los Angeles Paint and Varnish Production Club, and the Pacific Northwest Paint and Varnish Production Club collaborated to bring a national coatings symposium to the west coast, for the purpose of providing technical education and network opportunities to individuals associated with west coast paint companies that were not able to attend the coating’s conferences being held in the Midwest or on the east coast. At that time it was decided that the west coast symposium would be held on a biennial basis, rotating between the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco with the Los Angeles Club and Golden Gate Club as hosts, respectively, and that a trade show would be included, running concurrent with the symposium.\n\nThe first symposium and show was held in the spring of 1952 at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. The event was titled the \"Pacific Coast Production Clubs Symposium with Paint Materials and Equipment Show\". The second symposium and show was held in the spring of 1954 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.\n\nAfter the 1954 symposium and show, the Golden Gate, Los Angeles, and Pacific Northwest Clubs began meeting annually during the summer, in what was termed the \"Joint Executive Meeting\", to exchange ideas relative to the Clubs and discuss past and future symposiums. In the 1960s the Clubs changed their names to Golden Gate, Los Angeles, and Pacific Northwest Society for Coatings Technology, the annual summer meeting became the West Coast Societies Annual Meeting, and the Western Coatings Society for Coatings Technology (WCS) was born. The Rocky Mountain Society for Coatings Technology joined the WCS group in 1961, but unfortunately had to withdraw in 2006 due to low membership and participation within their society. The Arizona Society for Coatings Technology expressed interest in joining the WCS in 2004 and they were welcomed into the WCS in 2005.\n\nThe WCS Symposium and Show continued to be held in even years on a biennial basis, rotating between Southern California and Northern California, until 1976 when the symposium was moved to the spring of 1977 due to the Federation of Societies for Coatings Technology (FSCT) (currently the American Coatings Association, ACA) annual International Coatings Exposition (ICE) convention and paint show that was held in the fall of 1975 in Los Angeles. The WCS Symposium and Show has been held on a biennial basis on odd years ever since.\n\nDuring the winter of 1999, the Golden Gate Society moved the WCS Symposium from Northern California to Sparks, Nevada due to the exorbitant expense of holding the symposium in San Francisco. An additional change to the symposium and show was the implementation of table top exhibits instead of full booth exhibit space. The symposium and show was held in Los Angeles in 2001 and this was the last WCS symposium to take place in Los Angeles and in California. The WCS Symposium and show returned to Reno during the winter of 2003.\n\nAt the 2002 West Coast Societies Annual Meeting it was decided to change the rotating venue format of the symposium to the permanent neutral location of Las Vegas. In the fall of 2005, the WCS Symposium and Show moved to its new home city of Las Vegas, Nevada. The WCS incorporated in 2006 and currently consists of the Arizona, Golden Gate, Los Angeles, and Pacific Northwest Societies for Coatings Technology.\n\n\n"}

Most liner carriers are container shipping lines. The WSC is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and is led by Chief Executive Chief Executive John W. Butler, former general council for the WSC and former President of the Maritime Administrative Bar Association.\n\nCouncil membership includes the world's ten largest container shipping companies as well as smaller firms collectively comprising 90 percent of global container shipments.\n\nIn December 2014, it was announced that Christopher Koch, formerly the General Counsel for Sea-Land Service Incorporated and Chief of Staff for U.S.Senator John McCain and former Senator Slade Gorton would retire as President and CEO in July 2015, with Senior Vice-President and General Counsel, John Butler, assuming the position.\n\nThe Council was formed in 2000 to lobby national governments regarding container and cargo shipping regulation, generally in favour of improved maritime security coupled with deregulation of ports and transport routes. The Council also develops draft standards on vessel air emissions and pollution, improvements to seaport customs procedures and international standards for container design and handling.\n\nIn 2007, in response to continued problems with containers lost overboard during heavy seas, the WSC and the International Chamber of Shipping began work on a code of practice for container storage, including crew training on parametric rolling, safer stacking and marking of containers and the securing of above-deck cargo.\n"}
