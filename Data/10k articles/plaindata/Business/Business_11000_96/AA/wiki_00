In 1952, at age 36, he became the youngest American ambassador in history when he was appointed to be the U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador.\n\nDuke was born in New York City.\nHis father was Angier Buchanan Duke (1884–1923) and his mother was Cordelia Drexel Biddle, later Cordelia Biddle Robertson. Angier Buchanan Duke was an heir to the American Tobacco Company fortune while Cordelia Drexel Biddle was a member of the Biddle family who were prominent in business, political and cultural affairs in Philadelphia. Angier Biddle Duke's only sibling was Anthony Drexel Duke (1918–2014). After separating in 1918, Duke's parents divorced in 1921.\n\nHis paternal grandfather was Benjamin Newton Duke (1855–1929), a major benefactor of Duke University and brother of James Buchanan Duke, himself the father of Doris Duke, Angier's cousin. His maternal grandfather was Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Sr. Through his mother, he was a 2x great-grandson of banker Anthony Joseph Drexel.\n\nDuke attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He dropped out of Yale University in 1936.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Duke became skiing editor for a sports magazine and, by 1940, he enlisted as a private in the United States Army Air Forces. Upon his discharge in 1945, Duke was a major serving in North Africa and Europe. His uncle, Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr., was serving as ambassador to most of the governments-in-exile that were occupied by Germany during World War II.\n\nIn 1949, Duke joined the United States Foreign Service as an assistant in Buenos Aires and subsequently Madrid. From 1952 to 1953, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador during the Truman administration and was, aged 36, the youngest ever U.S. Ambassador up to that time.\n\nPeople thought Angie was just a rich playboy when President Truman appointed him Ambassador to El Salvador. He was 32 or 33 years old, the youngest ambassador in United States history, and the Duke name represented entrenched, giant capitalists.\n\nWith the Democratic Party out of power in 1953–1961, he left the foreign service and returned to private life. During much of this time, he served as President of the International Rescue Commission. Originally a Republican, he later became a Democrat.\n\nIn 1960, Duke accepted a call from the Kennedy administration, Kennedy was a personal friend, to serve as Chief of Protocol for the U.S. Department of State with the rank of Ambassador, holding this position until 1965. A vocal supporter of equal rights, \"he resigned from the Metropolitan Club of Washington after it refused to admit black diplomats\" in 1961. His most visible task during this term was to supervise the protocol for the world leaders who attended the November 25, 1963 funeral of John F. Kennedy.\n\nAt end of his term as Chief of Protocol, the Johnson administration asked him to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Spain, serving from 1965 to 1967, and then to Denmark, serving from 1968 to 1969. In 1969, he was awarded an honorary LL.D. degree from Duke University. Following sitting Vice-President Hubert Humphrey's defeat to Richard Nixon and the Democratic Party again out of power, he was again out of the U.S. Foreign Service. In the early 1970s, he was appointed by Mayor Abraham Beame to serve as Commissioner of the New York City Department of Civic Affairs and Public Events with a staff of 17 until he resigned in 1976 to work for Jimmy Carter's campaign for the presidency.\n\nWhen the Carter defeated Gerald Ford in the 1976 presidential election, the Democrats were again in power and in 1979, the administration brought him back again to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Morocco, a position he held until 1981 when he was succeeded by Joseph Verner Reed, Jr. following Ronald Reagan's election to President.\n\nUpon his return to the United States, the National Committee on American Foreign Policy awarded him with the inaugural Hans J. Morgenthau Memorial Award \"in recognition of his exemplary foreign policy contributions to the United States.\" From 1992 to 1995, Duke served as the elected president of the Council of American Ambassadors. He was a member of the Sons of the American Revolution. He also served as the chancellor of the Long Island University, Southampton Campus.\n\nAfter his death, his papers were archived by Duke University in North Carolina.\n\nIn 1936, he married Priscilla Avenal St. George (1919–1995). She was the daughter of George Baker Bligh St. George and Katharine St. George, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New York. Her maternal grandmother, Catherine Delano Collier, was the younger sister of Sara Delano Roosevelt, the mother of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and her great-grandfather was George Fisher Baker, the financier and philanthropist. Her father was the grandson of Robert St George, himself the son of Sir Richard Bligh St George, 2nd Baronet Before their divorce in August 1940, they were the parents of:\n\n\nFollowing their divorce, Priscilla married State Senator Allan A. Ryan, Jr. (1903–1981) in 1941. In November 1940, the 26 year old Duke married the 34 year old Margaret Screven White immediately after her divorce from J. M. Tuck. Margaret had also been married to Fitzhugh White and was the daughter of Franklin Buchanan Screven, great-granddaughter of Admiral Franklin Screven, commander of the Confederate USS \"Merrimack\", and a descendant of Thomas McKean, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThey divorced in 1952, the same year Duke married Maria-Luisa de Arana of Spain. She was the daughter of Isabella de Zurita and Dario de Arana and the granddaughter of the 10th Marquis de Campo Real, members of the Basque nobility of Bilbao. His third wife died in a plane crash in 1961.\n\n\nIn 1962, he married Robin Chandler Lynn (1923–2016), who served as the United States Ambassador to Norway during the Clinton administration. She had previously been married to Jeffrey Lynn, the actor and film producer, and was the daughter of Richard Edgar and Esther Chandler Tippett. They lived together at 740 Park Avenue in New York. Robin and Angier remained married until his death in 1995.\n\n\nDuke died at the age of 79, from being struck by a car while rollerblading.\n"}

Also referred to in articles and publications as A. L. Alexanian and Aris L. Alexanian.\n\nLittle is known of Aris's early life. He was born in Ağın, Turkey in 1901. His exact date of birth is unknown. He was orphaned at an early age with the untimely death of both his parents. He went into hiding for 6 months, in the Anatolia area of Turkey, to escape from the Armenian Genocide. He was shot and wounded during this period. Eventually he was able to escape the country. He arrived in New York City in 1920 then moved to Canada in 1921.\n\nIn 1923 Aris moved to Georgetown, Ontario to become a teacher and assistant superintendent at a school and farm for Armenian orphans. The boys were victims of the Armenian Genocide. Between 1900 and 1914 Canada took in some 1500 Armenian refugees. Then in the early 1920s thousands more came to Canada, including a group that came to be called The Georgetown Boys. The Georgetown school took in 109 boys who were educated and trained for farming. During this period Aris founded and organized the publishing of a monthly newsletter called \"Ararat\", which featured the art and writing of the orphan boys. The newsletter helped develop the English language skills of the boys. Aris was included as a character in a play set around the Georgetown orphanage. The play \"The Georgetown Boys\" was premiered at the John Elliot Theatre in Georgetown in 2008. Aris is also featured as a character in a children's book titled \"Call Me Aram\", which is also about The Georgetown Boys. More recently Aris was portrayed as a character in a musical entitled \"The Georgetown Boys: A Musical\" performed at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts In April 2009.\n\nIn January 1927 in Georgetown, Aris Alexanian married Mary Boghosian, who had recently arrived in Canada from Egypt. They lived for a time at the orphanage, before moving to Hamilton. They eventually had three sons together, Aram, Armen and Albert.\n\nAris moved to Hamilton, Ontario in 1927 where he opened an oriental rug store, called Oriental Art Galleries. His first year sales were 64 dollars. He imported handmade carpets from around the world, and eventually travelled extensively in the Middle East to buy carpets for his business. During this period he also started a rug cleaning operation.\n\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s Aris travelled extensively to the Middle East to buy carpets. Few people in the Hamilton area at the time travelled to these exotic lands, so his trips were a source of local interest. His travels were often chronicled in The Hamilton Spectator. A map in the window of his downtown Hamilton store was used to trace his journeys. Upon his return from these travels he would often lecture to local community and church groups and show photographs and films from his trips. By 1958 he claimed to have travelled 304,000 miles outside the country since the war. Aris was also an accomplished linguist and could speak six languages, which he used to his advantage for business negotiations in the more that 15 countries he typically visited during his travels.\n\nAris began to expand his carpet business in 1950, and opened a second store in Ottawa Ontario. He also expanded the rug cleaning operation in Hamilton. In 1955 the company was incorporated under the name of Alexanian and Sons Limited.\n\nAris Alexanian was involved in numerous community groups. He was a supporter of the Armenian Apostolic Church, The Ancient Landmarks of Hamilton group, and the Kiwanis Club. Aris, through his travels developed many friendships and connections around the world. He was a personal friend of Mirza Osman Ali Baig, the Pakistani High Commissioner to Canada, who visited Hamilton in May 1955, and was a guest speaker at the Hamilton Kiwanis Club.\n\nAris Alexanian died on June 27, 1961. The biography and obituary printed in the Hamilton Spectator announcing his death described Aris as \"one of Canada's leading rug importers and probably Hamilton's most widely travelled merchant\".\n\nAris through his commitment to public service has inspired a long tradition of community involvement within his family and business. Alexanian Carpet and Flooring has been a long time patron of the arts, in particular, theatre, music and opera. Albert is a member of the Ontario Arts Council, a volunteer executive with the Council for Business and the Arts in Canada and with the Canadian Association of Family Enterprises. Armen has been honoured for nearly 50 years of service with the Kiwanis Club, and has held numerous position in the organization, including President. He is also special advisor to the University of Waterloo Circle K Club. Aram was a supporter of the Armenian Church of Canada, and a founding member of St. Mary Armenian Church in Hamilton.\n\n\n"}

There is occasionally a guest host. The show has also let its guest hosts join in on the second and third hour just like its US and European counterparts. Regular contributors include Sri Jegarajah, Eunice Yoon (China), Emily Tan (Hong Kong) and Matthew Taylor (Sydney). Interviews with other analysts and C-level executives are also an essential part of the show.\n\n\"Asia Squawk Box\" debuted in February 1998 at 8.00 Singapore time in February 1998 when CNBC Asia merged with Asia Business News and it was presented by former CNBC Asia Morning Call personalities Rico Hizon (now with BBC World) and Geoff Cutmore (currently the main presenter of the show's counterpart in Europe, \"Squawk Box Europe\"). Bernard Lo and Cecilia Zecha came in to eventually replace Cutmore and Hizon respectively. In October 1998, \"Asia Squawk Box\" was extended to 90 minutes and in late 1999, the show started at 7.30 SIN time. In April 2000, \"Asia Squawk Box\" moved to 7.00 SIN time. Christine Tan assumed anchoring duties in July 2000 and on 30 October 2000, the show was extended to two hours with the last half-hour being named Squawk Plus.\n\nIn July 2001, \"Asia Squawk Box\" aired for a full three hours like its US counterpart from 7am to 10am SIN time. Around this time, Steven Engel was added to the team as a stockwatcher. In late 2002, Bettina Chua took over as anchor as Christine Tan was reassigned to the evening hours. As a result of the cancellation of \"Asia Wake Up Call\", \"ASB\" moved to the 6 to 9am SIN time timeslot.\n\nIn April 2005, Martin Soong assumed the anchoring duties for the program after Chua's departure from the network.\n\nSince 2006, the Asian version of \"Squawk Box\" has been guided editorially by Senior Producer Derrick McElheron, who also helped launch CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange\". As of 2006-10-30 (the same day the Asia network debuted a new graphics package similar to its US and European siblings), the show began using the titles in use by its US counterpart since late 2005, replacing the previous one that was used from 2004-2006.\n\nOn 2007-03-26, with McElheron at the helm, \"Asia Squawk Box\" was relaunched with a new live set, replacing the virtual set it had used since its creation, and a new co-presenter in Amanda Drury.

In the years from 1992 to 1999, Dæhlie won the Nordic World Cup six times, finishing second in 1994 and 1998. Dæhlie won a total of 29 medals in the Olympics and World Championships in the period between 1991 and 1999, making Dæhlie the most successful male cross-country skier in history.\n\nDuring his career, Dæhlie measured a VO max of 96 ml/kg/min. Dæhlie's result was achieved out of season, and physiologist Erlend Hem who was responsible for the testing stated that he would not discount the possibility of the skier passing 100 ml/kg/min at his absolute peak.\n\nIn addition to being an athletic figurehead, Dæhlie is a cultural icon in Norway. Since retiring, Dæhlie has become a successful businessman in real estate and fashion. His real estate investments have produced a fortune of more than half a billion kroner. Dæhlie has been featured in advertising campaigns, he started a brand of signature ski apparel, and he co-hosted a television show called \"Gutta på tur\". Dæhlie also invented the Salomon Nordic System Pilot Bindings.\n\nBorn in Elverum, Norway, Dæhlie later moved to Nannestad, where he settled down. Dæhlie attributes much of his success in sports to his upbringing where he was active in hunting, fishing, hiking, kayaking, football and of course, skiing from a very early age. For much of his childhood Dæhlie wanted to be a football player, but after being prompted by a coach, he tried Nordic skiing. Dæhlie did not have immediate success as a junior racer, but he consistently improved and eventually qualified for the FIS World Cup competitions.\n\nBjørn Dæhlie was first on the Norwegian skiing team for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. However, he did not participate in any races and was there to learn from more senior skiers. He later claimed these Olympics were the turning point for Norwegian skiing before their following period of success. He made his debut in the world cup in January 1989, finishing 11th on 15 km freestyle in Kavgolovo. In December the same year, he won his first world cup race. He finished first on the 15 km freestyle, the first world cup race of the season.\n\nIn the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1991 in Val di Fiemme, Dæhlie won his first World Championship gold medal. He beat skiing legend Gunde Svan on the 15 km freestyle. The medal was unexpected, since Dæhlie was young and still unknown. It was Norway's first individual gold medal in the World Championships since Oddvar Brå won gold in the same race in Oslo in 1982. Dæhlie also skied the last leg on the winning 4x10 km relay team.\n\nIn 1992, Dæhlie's period of dominance started. He won the world cup overall for the first time, a feat he would accomplish five more times in the next seven years. In Albertville Dæhlie won his first Olympic medals. He won gold in 10/15 km freestyle pursuit, 50 km freestyle and was on the winning team for the 4x10 km relay. He won a silver in 30 km classical style. Dæhlie also finished fourth on the 10 km freestyle, where his teammate Vegard Ulvang won the gold. Dæhlie completed the 4th leg of the relay, and crossed the finishing line backwards, having won by a margin of over one and a half minutes. Dæhlie and Ulvang completed a clean sweep of the cross-country skiing gold medals, each winning three golds and a silver. Dæhlie was awarded Fearnley's Olympic Prize for his performance, a prize given to the best performing Norwegian athlete in the Olympics.\n\nIn the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, Dæhlie won gold in the 10 km classical style and the 15 km freestyle pursuit. He won silver in the 30 km freestyle, where he was beaten by Thomas Alsgaard. The 4x10 km relay was a very tight race between Norway and Italy. The Italians won the gold after Silvio Fauner beat Dæhlie on the sprint on the last leg. In later years, Thomas Alsgaard took over the 4th leg on the Norwegian relay team with Dæhlie skiing the 3rd leg, since Alsgaard was the better sprinter.\n\nThe 1997 Skiing World Championships were Dæhlie's most successful World Championships. In front of the home crowd in Trondheim he won a medal in every race, taking gold in the 10 km classical race, the 10+15 km combined pursuit and the 4x10 km relay. In addition he won a silver in the 30 km freestyle and bronze in the 50 km classical. Dæhlie said the championships were like \"Lillehammer all over again\" and that \"For me, it's very special to compete in Norway\".\n\nDæhlie won three golds and one silver in his last Olympics in Nagano. He won the 10 km classical style, the 50 km freestyle and the 4x10 km skiing relay. In the 15 km freestyle pursuit, he got a silver medal having been beaten by Thomas Alsgaard on the sprint. Dæhlie won the 50 km freestyle ahead of Niklas Jonsson by only eight seconds. Both skiers collapsed on the finishing line, having given everything in pursuit of victory. Dæhlie described the race as his hardest race ever. Dæhlie also formed a lasting friendship with Phillip Boit, the Kenyan skier. Dæhlie waited for Boit on the finish line for 20 minutes following the 10 km race, saying Boit deserved encouragement. Philip went on to name one of his children Dæhlie Boit.\n\nDæhlie was planning to compete in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, but he was prevented from participating by a career-ending roller skiing accident in August 1999. The resulting back injury prevented Dæhlie from adding more medals to his collection. He retired from the sport in March 2001, having tried extensive rehabilitation and surgery to come back. His decision to retire shocked the nation of Norway, where Dæhlie was idolized for his great winning record.\n\nDæhlie's eight Olympic titles are a record for the Winter Olympics, as are his total of 12 Olympic medals (he also won four silver medals) which he amassed in three Olympics (Albertville, Lillehammer and Nagano). In addition to his achievements at the Olympics he had great success in the World Championships where he won 17 medals of which 9 were gold medals. He was particularly successful in the Trondheim 1997 World Championships, where he earned medals in all five events. Despite his unanticipated early exit from the sport, Dæhlie is considered by many to be one of the greatest Winter Olympic athletes of all time. In his illustrious career, Dæhlie never won a race at the Holmenkollen ski festival, but he was still awarded the Holmenkollen medal in 1997 (shared with Bjarte Engen Vik and Stefania Belmondo).\n\nHe also supports non-profit organisations that work for causes such as multiple sclerosis. In 2009 Dæhlie raced in the American Birkebeiner as a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis. Dæhlie competed in the classic race, which is 54 km long, finishing second in a photo finish.\n\nIn 2011, Dæhlie won the downhill event in the Kicksled World Championships in Hurdal.\nAlso in 2011, Dæhlie announced a comeback, stating his intention to participate in long distance races like Marcialonga and Vasaloppet\n\nDæhlie also participated in long-distance running in his youth, representing Ullensaker/Kisa IL. He participated in the Nordic junior match versus Denmark/Iceland, Finland and Sweden in 1987.\n\nAll results are sourced from the International Ski Federation (FIS).\n\n\nNote: Until the 1999 World Championships and the 1994 Olympics, World Championship and Olympic races were included in the World Cup scoring system.\n\n"}

For example, in a fundamental sense a stone or an arrow is capital for a caveman who can use it as a hunting instrument, while roads are capital for inhabitants of a city.\n\nAdam Smith defines capital as \"That part of men's stock which he expects to afford him revenue\". The term \"stock\" is derived from the Old English word for stump or tree trunk. It has been used to refer to all the moveable property of a farm since at least 1510.\n\nCapital goods, real capital, or capital assets are already-produced, durable goods or any non-financial asset that is used in production of goods or services.\n\nCapital is distinct from land (or non-renewable resources) in that capital can be increased by human labor. At any given moment in time, total physical capital may be referred to as the capital stock (which is not to be confused with the capital stock of a business entity).\n\nCapital is an input in the production function. Homes and personal autos are not usually defined as capital but as durable goods because they are not used in a production of saleable goods and services.\n\nIn Marxian political economy, capital is money used to buy something only in order to sell it again to realize a financial profit. For Marx capital only exists within the process of economic exchange—it is wealth that grows out of the process of circulation itself, and for Marx it formed the basis of the economic system of capitalism. In more contemporary schools of economics, this form of capital is generally referred to as \"financial capital\" and is distinguished from \"capital goods\".\n\nClassical and neoclassical economics regard capital as one of the factors of production (alongside the other factors: land and labour). All other inputs to production are called intangibles in classical economics. This includes organization, entrepreneurship, knowledge, goodwill, or management (which some characterize as talent, social capital or instructional capital).\n\nThis is what makes it a factor of production:\n\nThese distinctions of convenience have carried over to contemporary economic theory.\nThere was the further clarification that capital is a stock. As such, its value can be estimated at a point in time. By contrast, investment, as production to be added to the capital stock, is described as taking place over time (\"per year\"), thus a flow.\n\nMarxian economics distinguishes between different forms of capital:\n\nEarlier illustrations often described capital as physical items, such as tools, buildings, and vehicles that are used in the production process. Since at least the 1960s economists have increasingly focused on broader forms of capital. For example, investment in skills and education can be viewed as building up human capital or knowledge capital, and investments in intellectual property can be viewed as building up intellectual capital. These terms lead to certain questions and controversies discussed in those articles.\n\nDetailed classifications of capital that have been used in various theoretical or applied uses generally respect the following division:\n\nSeparate literatures have developed to describe both natural capital and social capital. Such terms reflect a wide consensus that nature and society both function in such a similar manner as traditional industrial infrastructural capital, that it is entirely appropriate to refer to them as different types of capital in themselves. In particular, they can be used in the production of other goods, are not used up immediately in the process of production, and can be enhanced (if not created) by human effort.\n\nThere is also a literature of intellectual capital and intellectual property law. However, this increasingly distinguishes means of capital investment, and collection of potential rewards for patent, copyright (creative or individual capital), and trademark (social trust or social capital) instruments.\n\nEconomist Henry George argued that financial instruments like stocks, bonds, mortgages, promissory notes, or other certificates for transferring wealth is not really capital. Because \"Their economic value merely represents the power of one class to appropriate the earnings of another\" and \"their increase or decrease does not affect the sum of wealth in the community\".\n\nSome thinkers, such as Werner Sombart and Max Weber, locate the concept of capital as originating in double-entry bookkeeping, which is thus a foundational innovation in capitalism, Sombart writing in \"Medieval and Modern Commercial Enterprise\" that:\n\nWithin classical economics, Adam Smith (\"Wealth of Nations\", Book II, Chapter 1) distinguished fixed capital from circulating capital. The former designated physical assets not consumed in the production of a product (e.g. machines and storage facilities), while the latter referred to physical assets consumed in the process of production (e.g. raw materials and intermediate products). For an enterprise, both were types of capital.\n\nKarl Marx adds a distinction that is often confused with David Ricardo's. In Marxian theory, variable capital refers to a capitalist's investment in labor-power, seen as the only source of surplus-value. It is called \"variable\" since the amount of value it can produce varies from the amount it consumes, \"i.e.\", it creates new value. On the other hand, constant capital refers to investment in non-human factors of production, such as plant and machinery, which Marx takes to contribute only its own replacement value to the commodities it is used to produce.\n\nInvestment or capital accumulation, in classical economic theory, is the production of increased capital. Investment requires that some goods be produced that are not immediately consumed, but instead used to produce other goods as capital goods. Investment is closely related to saving, though it is not the same. As Keynes pointed out, saving involves not spending all of one's income on current goods or services, while investment refers to spending on a specific type of goods, \"i.e.\", capital goods.\n\nAustrian School economist Eugen Boehm von Bawerk maintained that capital intensity was measured by the roundaboutness of production processes. Since capital is defined by him as being goods of higher-order, or goods used to produce consumer goods, and derived their value from them, being future goods.\n\nHuman development theory describes human capital as being composed of distinct social, imitative and creative elements:\nThis theory is the basis of triple bottom line accounting and is further developed in ecological economics, welfare economics and the various theories of green economics. All of which use a particularly abstract notion of capital in which the requirement of capital being produced like durable goods is effectively removed.\n\nThe Cambridge capital controversy was a dispute between economists at Cambridge, Massachusetts based MIT and University of Cambridge in the UK about the measurement of capital. The Cambridge, UK economists, including Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa claimed that there is no basis for aggregating the heterogeneous objects that constitute 'capital goods.'\n\nPolitical economists Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler have suggested that capital is not a productive entity, but solely financial and that capital values measure the relative power of owners over the broad social processes that bear on profits.\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics Of Capital\n"}

Depending on various district definitions, either the Civic Center or Bunker Hill also contains the Music Center and adjacent Walt Disney Concert Hall; some maps, for example, place the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in the Civic Center but the Disney Concert Hall in Bunker Hill.\n\nThe Civic Center has the distinction of containing the largest concentration of government employees in the United States outside of Washington, D.C. The reason for the high concentration is simple: Los Angeles is the most populous county in the United States and its second largest city, and houses several state and federal functions for the region.\n\nThe Civic Center is served by numerous Metro buses, most of which run to adjacent Union Station, the 101 and 110 freeways, and the Metro Red Line and Purple Line's Civic Center/Grand Park Station are also in the vicinity. OCTA, Foothill Transit, DASH shuttles, Commuter Express and other municipal bus lines also serve the area. \n\nThe Regional Connector, currently under construction, will serve this area with two stations at Second/Flower and Second/Broadway station.\n\nThe Civic Center area is part of the ongoing Grand Avenue Project, which aims to develop existing parking lots in the area for residential and commercial use as well as create a Grand Park between the Los Angeles Music Center and City Hall.\n\nIn March 2017, the Los Angeles City Council approved a new Civic Center Master Plan. It details a full build out around city hall by the year 2032, specifically the east facing front. The CCMP schedules for a full tear down of Parker Center, L.A. City Hall's \"south\" building, and the Los Angeles Mall. The CCMP is to connect City Hall with its surrounding neighborhood and Little Tokyo. \n\nThe CCMP calls for active ground-floor uses, to stimulate the pedestrian traffic that the Civic Center currently lacks.

Verwoerd survived, but was killed six years later by Dimitri Tsafendas.\n\nPratt was a wealthy businessman and farmer of British descent. He qualified as a chartered accountant at the University of Cambridge, England. He suffered from epilepsy from an early age and was a loner at school. Both of Pratt's marriages failed. There is evidence that he suffered from his first serious bout of depression in 1946 after his divorce from Mary Hatrick. His second marriage, to Patty van Heijningen, was not successful either. \n\nIn 1954, shortly after the birth of their first child, Pratt claimed to have received a message which he should convey to South Africa. He was boarded and diagnosed as suffering from “grandiose delusions of the political saviour type”. Pratt was almost constantly in psychiatric treatment. His Dutch wife feared for her safety because he threatened her. In the beginning of 1958 she left him and returned to The Hague, taking their two children with her. He followed her with a gun in his pocket but was apprehended at Amsterdam Airport. His condition worsened and he became manic. His neurologist, Dr.Chesler, urged his sister to have a \"curator bonis\" (legal guardian) appointed for him because he could no longer manage his affairs properly. He desperately tried to win his wife back. When that failed, he attempted to kidnap his little daughter during a ski holiday. As he became more desperate about his marital problems, Pratt tried to commit suicide on three different occasions. It appears that Pratt’s paranoid condition was reinforced by the escalation of the political conflict after the Sharpeville massacre.\n\nOn 9 April 1960, Pratt shot South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd twice, at point blank range, with a .22 pistol. Verwoerd, who had been opening the Union Exposition in Milner Park, Johannesburg, was rushed to hospital, and within two months had made a complete recovery. Pratt was arrested at the scene and taken to the Marshall Square police station, and then to the Forensic Medical Laboratory. He appeared for a preliminary hearing in the Johannesburg Magistrates' Court on 20 and 21 July 1960, once it was clear that the Verwoerd's injuries were not fatal.\n\nPratt claimed he had been shooting 'the epitome of apartheid'. The court accepted the medical reports submitted to it by five different psychiatrists, all of which confirmed that Pratt lacked legal capacity and could not be held criminally liable for having shot the prime minister. On 26 September 1960, he was committed to a mental hospital in Bloemfontein.\n\nOn the first of October 1961, his fifty-third birthday, and shortly before his parole was to be considered, he committed suicide.\n"}

{"id": "35879890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35879890", "title": "Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)", "text": "Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)\n\nThe Gordon Bennett Aviation Trophy was an international airplane racing trophy awarded by James Gordon Bennett Jr., the American owner and publisher of the \"New York Herald\" newspaper. The trophy is one of three Gordon Bennett awards: Bennett was also the sponsor of an automobile race and a ballooning competition.\n\nThe terms of the trophy competition were the same as those of the Schneider Trophy: each race was hosted by the nation which had won the preceding race, and the trophy would be won outright by the nation whose team won the race three times in succession. Accordingly, after Joseph Sadi-Lecointe's victory in 1920 the Trophy became the permanent possession of the Aéro-Club de France.\n\nFollowing the success of the Gordon Bennett balloon competition, which had become the most important competition for the sport, Gordon Bennett announced a competition for powered aircraft in December 1908, commissioning a trophy from André Auroc, the sculptor who had created the trophies for both the balloon and automobile competitions. Formulation of the competition rules was entrusted to the Aéro-Club de France. It was decided that each competing nation would be allowed to field a team of three competitors.\n\nThe 1909 competition was held as part of the Grande Semaine d'Aviation held at Reims in France, and consisted of 2 laps of a circuit. Like the subsequent competitions, it was not a direct race, but a time trial, with competitors taking off separately. As aircraft became faster and their engines more reliable, the distance to be covered was increased each year.\n\nThe last competition was held in 1920 in the French communes of Orléans and Étampes. Unlike those held before the First World War which were over short courses marked by pylons, the competition was held between two points apart because of the growing speed of aircraft. Joseph Sadi-Lecointe won in a time of 1 hour, 6 minutes and 17.2 seconds, while fellow French aviator Bernard de Roumanet finished second in a time of 1 hour, 39 minutes and 6.9 seconds.\n\nThe 1914 race was to have been held at Reims between 19 September and 28 September, but was cancelled due to the outbreak of the First World War. There was no contest in 1919.\n\nThe selection trial for the French team was held on the first day of the Grande Semaine d'Aviation. Hampered by gusty winds and rain which turned the grass flying-field to glutinous mud, many of the twenty entrants were unable to take off and none managed to complete the necessary two laps. Eugène Lefebvre, flying Wright biplane put up the best performance, nearly completing the course; Louis Blériot, who had managed to fly about 2.5 km in a Blériot XI put up the next-best performance. It was decided that the third place would be given on the basis of performance in the speed competition to be held that afternoon, and was taken by Hubert Latham.\n\nThe Wrights themselves had passed on an invitation to compete at Reims, though it seemed awkward since the Gordon Bennett Trophy was crowned with a large replica of a Wright Flyer. The Aero Club of America, which had sponsored the Scientific American trophy won by Curtiss a year earlier, turned to him. His aircraft was not as well developed as the Wright machines and while it was more maneuverable than the European aircraft, it was not nearly as fast. Despite this disadvantage, Curtiss won in 15 minutes and 50.4 seconds. Blériot finished second place with a time of 15 minutes and 56.2 seconds, 5.8 seconds more than Curtiss. \nThe 1910 competition was held at the Belmont Park racetrack in New York as the culminating event of a week-long aviation meet. The 5 km course marked out for the competition attracted strong criticism from the competing pilots. Alfred Leblanc, captain of the French team, described it as a death-trap because of the obstacles which would hinder any pilot trying to make an emergency landing, and a tight turn less than 30 m (100 ft) from one of the grandstands was christened \"Dead Man's Corner\" by the press. However, the race proceeded as planned.\n\nContestants were permitted to start at any time during a seven-hour period on the day of the race. Claude Grahame-White was first to take off at 8:42, flying a Blériot XI powered by a 100 hp Gnome Double Omega and completing his first lap in 3 minutes 15 seconds. He was followed by Alec Ogilvie flying a Wright Model R at 9:08 and Alfred Leblanc at 9:20. Leblanc, who was the chief pilot for the Blériot company, was flying a 100 hp Blériot XI differing slightly from Grahame-White's, with a different propeller and a reduced wingspan. Leblanc's aircraft was clearly faster: after four laps his time was 1 minute 20 seconds better than Grahame-White's and he completed his nineteenth lap after 52 minutes 49.6 seconds in the air, Grahame -White having completed the 20 lap course in 1 hour 1 minute 4.47 seconds. However half-way round the last lap Leblanc's engine stopped, either through fuel shortage or the breakage of a fuel line, and he had to make a forced landing, colliding with a telegraph pole but fortunately escaping serious injury.\n\nMeanwhile, Alec Ogilvie had been forced to land by engine problems after 13 laps after a delay of 54 minutes he took off again and eventually completed the course in a total time of 2h 26m 36.6s, good enough to gain him third place.\n\nWalter Brookins, flying the Wright \"Baby Grand\", was about to take off when Leblanc crashed, and decided to fly to the scene of the accident to see if he could help. However shortly after takeoff a connecting rod broke and his aircraft was wrecked in the subsequent forced landing. Brooking was unhurt. Hubert Latham took off at 10:59, but his attempt was plagued by engine failures, and he spent about four hours on the ground making repairs, eventually completing the course in 5h 48m 53s, an average speed of .\n\nShortly before the latest permitted takeoff time John Drexel and John Moisant, both flying Blériot IXs, started their attempts. Drexel was forced to retire after seven laps, while Moisant completed the course in 1h 57s 44.8s after landing more than once with engine problems, securing second place.\n\nThe 1911 race was held on 1 July at the Royal Aeronautical Society's flying field at Eastchurch, and attracted a crowd of around 10,000 spectators despite the comparative remoteness to the location. Both France and Britain entered three pilots with three reserves, the British entries including a Bristol Prier monoplane to be flown by Grahame Gilmour, but this was not ready in time to compete. The competition coincided with the Circuit of Europe air race, as a result of which the British pilot James Valentine withdrew: however Charles Weymann, the sole American representative chose to withdraw from the Circuit of Europe to take part in the Gordon Bennett competition.\n\nThe start of the competition was delayed by poor weather, and the first competitor Gustav Hamel, did not take off until 2:50 in the afternoon. Flying a Blériot XXIII monoplane which had been modified shortly before the race by having its wings cut down by about a metre (39 in), he misjudged his first turn and\ncrashed at high speed, astonishingly escaping without serious injury. At 3:00 Louis Chevalier, flying a Nieuport II powered by a Nieuport engine. After five laps his engine began showing signs of trouble and he was eventually forced to land after eleven laps, damaging his undercariage. He then resumed his attempt flying a replacement aircraft, but this also suffered an engine failure shortly after takeoff and he was forced to withdraw. Weymann took off at 3:45, impressing spectators by the steepness of his banked turns, shortly followed at 4:47 by Alec Ogilvie, flying the aircraft in which he had finished third the previous year, now powered by a 50 hp N.E.C engine. Last to take off were Edouard Nieuport and Alfred Leblanc. Leblanc was recovering from influenza and, probably made cautious by Hamel's crash, did not take the corners as sharply as Weymann, and Nieuport's aircraft, with a less powerful engine that Weyman's, was clearly not in serious competition. \n\nThe 1912 race was held on 9 September in Clearing, Illinois. The race was 30 laps around an elliptical course, for a total distance of . As none of the U.S. aircraft available to fly that day could exceed , and with Védrines practice flights averaging far better, a French win was expected prior to the start of the race. \n\n\n"}

He was a half-brother of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. In 1808 he graduated from the College of William & Mary.\n\nHenry Lee IV served as a speech writer for the statesman John C. Calhoun as well as Andrew Jackson. After Jackson won election to the presidency in 1828, Lee, along with Jackson and William Berkeley Lewis, helped write the inaugural address. President Jackson rewarded him with a consular appointment to Algeria; the Senate, however, refused the confirmation.\n\nIn his remaining seven years of his life, Henry Lee traveled abroad, dying in Paris, France.\n\nOn 29 March 1817 he married Anne Robinson McCarty, daughter of Daniel McCarty and Margaret Robinson. Anne and Henry had one child, Margaret. Margaret was born in autumn of 1818, and died at the age of two in a tragic accident.\n\nLee′s nickname of \"Black Horse\" — a pun on the nickname of his famous father, \"Light Horse\" Harry Lee — originated in a scandal two years after his daughter′s death. Lee began an illicit affair with his wife′s young sister, Elizabeth, who was his ward at the time. According to at least one version of the story, Elizabeth became pregnant, although there′s no record of the child having survived. \nThe McCarthy family brought suit to remove Lee as trustee of Elizabeth's inheritance and recovery of the money. Unbeknownst to the McCarthys, Lee had misappropriated a portion of the trust for upkeep of Stratford Hall Plantation, the Lee family's ancestral home for six generations. In order to conceal the misappropriation, Lee attempted unsuccessfully to marry Elizabeth off to an unscrupulous suitor. The legal fallout and resulting scandal forced Lee to sell Stratford out of the family. Elizabeth McCarty lived at Stratford for 50 years, from 1829 until her death in 1879.\n\nAnne Lee, who had become addicted to morphine in an attempt to recover from grief at the death of her daughter, fled to Tennessee. She was often a guest of future president Andrew Jackson and his wife. Henry Lee later followed, beseeching his wife for forgiveness. Andrew Jackson befriended Lee and began to assist in rehabilitating him in political and social life.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50528637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50528637", "title": "High heel policy", "text": "High heel policy\n\nA high heel policy is a regulation or law about the wearing of high heels, which may be required or forbidden in different places and circumstances.\n\nHistorically, high heels were used by aristocratic women for cosmetic reasons, to raise their height or to keep their feet and long dresses clean. The style was then subject to sumptuary laws. In more modern times, stiletto heels have been restricted when they might damage the floor surface or cause accidents.\n\nSome dress codes, however, require women to wear high heels so that they appear to be taller and more attractive. Such footwear may be painful and damage the feet, and there have been repeated protests by women workers against such policies. In 2016, a British receptionist was dismissed for not wearing high heels and she then started a petition which attracted sufficient support to be considered by the UK Parliament.\n\nIn 1430, \"chopines\" were high, at times. Venetian law then limited the height to three inches—but this regulation was widely ignored. A 17th-century law in Massachusetts announced that women would be subjected to the same treatment as witches if they lured men into marriage via the use of high-heeled shoes. In 1770, an act was introduced into the British parliament which would have applied the same penalties as witchcraft to the use of high heels and other cosmetic devices.\n\nThe pressure under a stiletto heel is greater (per unit of the very small area) than that under the feet of an elephant. Thus, as the very narrow stiletto heel became more widespread in the 1950s, the owners of many types of buildings became concerned about the effects of large numbers of such heels on their floors, especially in historic and high-traffic public buildings. Specifically, there was concern that the heels would either damage certain types of floor covering or cause minor accidents through heels getting jammed in floor-grills, the gaps in planking, or uneven surfaces. Soft outdoor ground also caused problems, affecting both the surface and the wearer. Wood flooring was the most vulnerable, but carpets, linoleum, and mosaic floors were also considered at risk of damage. Signs were frequently posted attempting to ban stiletto heels, though they were generally ineffective. A 1963 article in a US building maintenance magazine stated, \"Replacement of floors is estimated to have cost at least half a billion dollars throughout the country since the advent of the stiletto heel fashion.\"\n\nWhen stiletto heels were first sold in Africa, many of the wearers fell through the floors of their homes, not realizing that the floor timbers had been partly removed by termites. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service claimed in 1963 that \"with style changes the stiletto-heel problem has diminished\".\n\nHigh heels can represent contributory negligence by the plaintiff in American personal injury cases involving slip and fall accidents. Many high heel policies in the US are related to concerns over the potential for legal claims.\n\nSome women have challenged the expectation that women should wear high heels in formal social situations. In 2015, a group of women were turned away from a film première at the Cannes Film Festival in France for wearing flat shoes, including a woman physically unable to wear heels due to an operation on one of her feet. The women complained that this was a sexist policy which forced women into a stereotyped appearance; festival organisers later responded that there was no official policy on footwear and stated that they would remind red carpet officials of this.\n\nGuidelines on acceptable dress codes in the workplace are permitted by Canadian law in order to ensure that employees are able to complete their work safely and effectively. However the inclusion of the wearing of high heels in these guidelines has created controversy. Some workplace studies show that women in the hospitality industry who wear high heels have suffered injuries after tripping, falling or slipping. In addition, requirements for appearance which differ for male and female employees have the potential to be considered discriminatory.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, several US-based airlines required female flight attendants to wear shoes with heels. Minimum heel heights ranged from one-half inch to the two inches mandated by USAir. Flight attendants at times avoided censure by changing into more comfortable shoes during flights, since their supervisors were less likely to be present there.\n\nIn 2009, the UK Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists released a report outlining the dangers of wearing high heels for extended periods and approached unions and employers to collaborate on measures to ensure risk assessments would be completed on women's footwear, and to offer alternatives to high heels where these were deemed unhealthy.\n\nPolicies that force women to wear heels have been challenged in a number of locations. In 2001, cocktail waitresses in Las Vegas organised a \"Kiss My Foot\" campaign which was successful in getting casinos to relax their requirement to wear high heels. In 2014, waitresses at three restaurant chains in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, claimed that they were required to wear high heels at work despite complaining of pain and injury. Management responded that there was no written policy on wearing high heels. In 2015, the Israeli airline El Al introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated. The airline's workers' union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule.\n\nSimilar policies were tested again in the UK in 2016 when a temporary receptionist, Nicola Thorp, was sent home unpaid after she refused to follow the dress code at the office of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers. Outsourcing firm Portico stated that Thorp \"had signed the appearance guidelines\" but after Thorp launched an online petition—\"Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work\"—the firm changed their policy. The new guideline states that all female employees \"can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer.\" The petition gained widespread support from public figures such as Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MPs Caroline Dinenage, Margot James and Tulip Siddiq. Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; the company had already changed its terms of employment. The petition gained over 130,000 signatures, sufficient for a debate in the British parliament. This took place on 6 March 2017, when MPs decided the UK government should change the law to prevent the demand being made by employers. However, this was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was \"adequate\".\n\nIn April 2017, the Canadian province of British Columbia amended workplace legislation to prevent employers from requiring women to wear high heels at work. British Columbia premier Christy Clark stated that the government was \"changing this regulation to stop this unsafe and discriminatory practice.\"\n\nAlso in 2017, the Philippines forbid companies from mandating that female employees have to wear high heels at work.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7486677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7486677", "title": "Leaseback", "text": "Leaseback\n\nLeaseback, short for \"sale-and-leaseback,\" is a financial transaction in which one sells an asset and leases it back for the long term; therefore, one continues to be able to use the asset but no longer owns it. The transaction is generally done for fixed assets, notably real estate, as well as for durable and capital goods such as airplanes and trains. The concept can also be applied by national governments to territorial assets; prior to the Falklands War, the government of the United Kingdom proposed a leaseback arrangement whereby the Falklands Islands would be transferred to Argentina, with a 99-year leaseback period, and a similar arrangement, also for 99 years, had been in place prior to the handover of Hong Kong to mainland China. Leaseback arrangements are usually employed because they confer financing, accounting or taxation benefits.\n\nAfter purchasing an asset, the owner enters a long-term agreement by which the property is leased back to the seller at an agreed rate. One reason for a leaseback is to transfer ownership to a holding company while keeping proper track of the ongoing worth and profitability of the asset. Another reason is for the seller to raise money by offloading a valuable asset to a buyer who is presumably interested in making a long-term secured investment. Leaseback arrangements are common in the REIT industry.\n\nAccording to Robert Peston, one-time Business Editor for the BBC, one option being considered for dealing with the subprime mortgage crisis is a sale-and-leaseback of toxic assets. Peston says \"a sale-and-leaseback between the banks and the state has two supreme advantages: there's no need to value the poisonous assets; and losses on those stinky assets would be absorbed by the banks in manageable chunks over about 10 years.\"\n\nLeaseback arrangements are popular in France, the United States, United Kingdom, and throughout Australia and Asia, including, more recently, in India.\n\nLeaseback of residential property has been popular in France for more than 30 years, and there are significant tax advantages. Under the scheme, the purchaser may use the property usually between 1 and 8 weeks per year (with a maximum of 6 months per year). The French government encourages the development of leaseback schemes in touristic areas to alleviate shortages in rental accommodation. The government rebates the local VAT (which is 19.6%), when the property is purchased off plan.\n\nThe scheme works by purchasing a freehold property. You become the legal owner. The property is then leased back to the developer or a management company. Under the leaseback scheme the government also refunds to you the VAT normally charged on a new build properties (currently 19.6%).\n\nThe owner is then guaranteed a rental income throughout the period of the lease. The net return to the owner varies between developments but is typically between 4% to 6%. This compares very favourably with a typical 20 year fixed rate mortgage of around 3.75%, and variable rate mortgages which are lower. It can be seen how the rental income can be used in respect of the mortgage payments. Loans of between 75% and 85% are available depending upon circumstances. The rental yield is also index linked annually to construction costs, which means the rental income currently increases by approximately 2.5%.\n\nAs in the UK there are tax allowances in respect of mortgage payments which can be offset against income. The lease typically lasts for between 9 and 11 years, after which the management company has the option to either renew, or the property can be sold, or rented out and held privately by the owner.\n\nThe purchaser/owner can also enjoy periods of usage free of charge through the year, depending upon the terms of the lease. These terms normally allows for between 4 and 6 weeks free usage each year. The management company is responsible for the maintenance of the property including the maintenance of furnishings which are often included in the purchase price. The developer is also responsible for insuring the building and its contents. It also pays for some of the property taxes and all the utility costs.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a form of leaseback known as sale and rent back was the subject of a 2014 Supreme Court case that found many such arrangements had been perpetrated fraudulently.\n\nA \"sale/leaseback\" or \"sale and leaseback\" is a transaction in which the owner of a property sells an asset, typically real estate, and then leases it back from the buyer. In this way the transaction functions as a loan, with payments taking the form of rent. Due to the lack of financing available in today’s market, many American businesses are increasingly turning to sale-and-leasebacks to provide quick capital. For example, developers of master-planned communities will often sell the model home to a buyer before the community is sold out, leasing it back from the buyer for a period of up to two years. In some arrangements, the current lessee will give the option to buy the asset back at the end of the lease. Typically, if the original owner were to buy back the asset, it would take place at the end of the tax year, in case any party were to be audited by the IRS.\n\nThe leaseback concept has spread to other European countries, including Spain and Switzerland. Typical property available are studios, apartments, and villas. They are situated near ski areas, beach resorts, or golf courses.\n\nA sale-and-leaseback is typically a commercial real estate transaction in which one party, often a corporation, sells its corporate real estate assets to another party, such as an institutional investor, or a real estate investment trust (REIT), and then leases the property back at a rental rate and lease term that is acceptable to the new investor/landlord. The lease term and rental rate are based on the new investor/landlord's financing costs, the lessee's credit rating, and a market rate of return, based on the initial cash investment by the new investor/landlord. \n\nThe reasons and advantages for a seller/lessee are varied, but the most common are:\n\n\nThe advantages for an investor/landlord are:\n\n\nLeaseback is also commonly used in general aviation, with buyers using the scheme to let flight schools and other FBOs use their aircraft.\n\nLeaseback is very often used in commercial aviation to essentially take back the cash invested in assets. Airlines, for example, sell aircraft and engines to lessors, banks or other financial institutions who, in turn, lease the assets back to them. Tax deductions can also be realized by the airline since the asset is no longer owned but leased. Due to the high price of aircraft and engines, especially new, the cash from such a leaseback is used by airlines to improve their financial performance.\n\nThe leaseback concept has also spread to industry, mostly for industrial equipment. A company sells some of its equipment to a lessor, such as a bank or another financial institution, which leases the equipment back to the company. Thus the company is no longer the owner of the equipment but keeps the use of it. This commercial transaction allows two companies to have at their immediate disposal the cash to make investments in new business opportunities.\n\n"}

{"id": "27863892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27863892", "title": "Margin Call (film)", "text": "Margin Call (film)\n\nMargin Call is a 2011 American drama film written and directed by J. C. Chandor in his feature directorial debut. The principal story takes place over a 24-hour period at a large Wall Street investment bank during the initial stages of the financial crisis of 2007–08. In focus are the actions taken by a group of employees during the subsequent financial collapse. The ensemble cast features Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Zachary Quinto, Penn Badgley, Simon Baker, Demi Moore, and Stanley Tucci.\n\nThe film was produced by the production companies Before the Door Pictures, Benaroya Pictures, and Washington Square Films. Theatrically, it was commercially distributed by Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions. \"Margin Call\" explores capitalism, greed, and investment fraud. Following its wide release in theaters, the film garnered award nominations from the Detroit Film Critics Society, along with several separate nominations for its screenplay and direction from recognized award organizations, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The score was orchestrated by musician Nathan Larson.\n\nThe film made its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2011, and opened in theaters nationwide in the United States on October 21, 2011, grossing $5,354,039 in domestic ticket receipts. It was screened at 199 theaters during its widest release in cinemas. It earned an additional $14,150,000 in business through international release to top out at a combined $19,504,039 in gross theatrical revenue. It was a ground-breaking day-and-date release that earned more than $10,000,000 in video-on-demand sales during its initial theatrical release. Preceding its theatrical release, \"Margin Call\" was met with overwhelmingly positive critical reviews. The DVD and Blu-ray editions of the film were released in the United States on December 20, 2011.\n\nAn investment bank begins a mass layoff on the trading floor during a normal business day. Among those let go is Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), head of risk management. Dale tries to speak about his current, unfinished project, first with human resources staff and then with desk head Will Emerson (Paul Bettany), but is told that this is no longer his concern. While being escorted out of the building he meets one of his risk analysts, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), and gives him a USB stick to look at with a vague instruction to \"be careful.\"\n\nSullivan works late that night to finish Dale's project, and discovers that current volatility in the firm's portfolio of mortgage-backed securities has exceeded the historical volatility levels of the positions. Because of excessive leverage, if the firm's assets decrease by 25%, the loss will be greater than the value of the firm itself and the firm will go bankrupt. Sullivan and his colleague, junior analyst Seth Bregman (Badgley), tell Emerson about the situation. Emerson alerts floor head Sam Rogers (Spacey), who also returns to the office. They attempt to contact Dale, but the company shut off his phone and he hadn't yet returned home.\n\nThey have emergency meetings in the middle of the night with division head Jared Cohen (Baker), chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson (Moore), and other senior executives to discuss their options. Finally CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) is called in. Cohen's plan is for the firm to quickly dump all of the toxic assets in a fire sale before the market learns of their worthlessness, thereby limiting the firm's exposure, a plan favored by Tuld. Rogers protests that dumping the firm's toxic assets will spread the risk throughout the financial sector and destroy the firm's relationships with its counterparties, as well as cripple the market for the foreseeable future. He also warns Cohen that their customers will quickly learn of the firm's plans once they realize that the firm is only selling the toxic securities, but is not buying any new ones.\n\nThey finally locate Dale back at his home in Brooklyn, and Will is able to convince him to return to the office, informing him that the firm will not pay him his severance and other benefits unless he agrees to participate in their plan. Will also tells Seth he'll probably lose his job in the crisis, but will get a large severance, while explaining to him the amoral, cyclical nature of the markets. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Robertson, Cohen, and Tuld were aware of the risks in the weeks leading up to the crisis. Tuld offers Robertson up as the scapegoat, putting the blame of the crisis on her and forcing her resignation. Both Dale and Robertson are instructed to remain in the office all day and do nothing in return for an increase to their severance packages. Robertson expresses regret for not doing more to stop the crisis.\n\nBefore morning, Tuld is able to convince Rogers to go along with Cohen's plan. In a speech to his traders in preparation for the fire sale, Rogers warns them that, by participating, they are effectively ruining their reputations and ending their careers in the industry, but offers a $1.4 million dollar bonus to those able to sell 93% of their assigned securities, with further $1.3 million dollar bonuses if the entire sales floor can reach 93% as a whole. As the trading bell sounds and the markets open, Emerson and the traders immediately begin rapidly selling off their securities, and quickly arouse suspicion and anger from their buyers as the hours pass, and by closing bell the firm takes tremendous losses while dumping positions for cents on the dollar, but is able to successfully sell off all the toxic assets. After trading hours end, Cohen tells Rogers there will be another round of layoffs, but Rogers will keep his job. Angry that he was retained, Rogers confronts Tuld in the executive dining room, telling him that he wants to cash in on his options and severance pay and leave the company, but Tuld dismisses his protests, claiming that the current crisis is no different from various bear markets of the past, and that sharp gains and losses are simply part of the economic cycle. He persuades Rogers to stay at the firm for another two years, promising that there will be a lot of money to be made from the coming crisis. Cohen is seen bringing Sullivan into the dining room, and Tuld informs Rogers he is promoting Sullivan. Rogers reluctantly accepts Tuld's deal, but says it's only because he needs the money.\n\nRogers buries his dog in his ex-wife's front yard in the middle of the night, and learns from her that their son's financial firm took a big hit but survived the day's trading.\nThe screen cuts to black and the credits roll as the sound of Rogers shoveling dirt continues.\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 21, 2010, in New York City. More than 80% of the action was shot on the 42nd floor of One Penn Plaza, which had recently been vacated by a trading firm.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The film also played In Competition at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival and was nominated for the Golden Bear. The film was produced by Zachary Quinto's production company, Before the Door Pictures, by Quinto and his two producing partners and Carnegie Mellon University classmates, Neal Dodson and Corey Moosa.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics, garnering an 89% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 158 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Smart, tightly wound, and solidly acted, \"Margin Call\" turns the convoluted financial meltdown of '08 into gripping, thought-provoking drama.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"The New Yorker\" film critic David Denby said it was \"easily the best Wall Street movie ever made\". Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three and half stars out of four, and said: \"\"Margin Call\" employs an excellent cast who can make financial talk into compelling dialogue.\" A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"It is hard to believe that \"Margin Call\" is Mr. Chandor’s first feature. His formal command — his ability to imply far more than he shows or says and to orchestrate a large, complex drama out of whispers, glances, and snippets of jargon — is downright awe inspiring.\"\n\nRoger Ebert wrote: \"I think the movie is about how its characters are concerned only by the welfare of their corporations. There is no larger sense of the public good. Corporations are amoral, and exist to survive and succeed, at whatever human cost. This is what the Occupy Wall Street protesters are angry about: They are not against capitalism, but about Wall Street dishonesty and greed. [...] [The cast] reflects the enormity of what is happening: Their company and their lives are being rendered meaningless.\" A.O. Scott wrote: \"\"Margin Call\" is a thriller, moving through ambient shadows to the anxious tempo of Nathan Larson’s hushed, anxious score. It is also a horror movie, with disaster lurking like an unseen demon outside the skyscraper windows and behind the computer screens. It is also a workplace comedy of sorts. The crackling, syncopated dialogue and the plot, full of reversals and double crosses, owe an obvious debt to David Mamet’s profane fables of deal-making machismo. Hovering over all of it is the dark romance of capital: the elegance of numbers; the kinkiness of money; the deep, rotten, erotic allure of power.\"\n\nAlthough the film does not depict any real Wall Street firm, and the fictional firm is never named, the plot has similarities to some events during the 2008 financial crisis: Goldman Sachs similarly moved early to hedge and reduce its position in mortgage-backed securities, at the urging of two employees, which essentially mirrors Tuld's comment about the advantage of moving first. Lehman Brothers moved second and went bankrupt. John Tuld's name is said to be a combination of Merrill Lynch’s ex-CEO John Thain and Lehman Brothers' ex-CEO Richard Fuld .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31589179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31589179", "title": "Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts", "text": "Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts\n\nMetro Center is the original colonial settlement of Springfield, Massachusetts, located beside a bend in the Connecticut River. As of 2011, Metro Center features a majority of Western Massachusetts' most important cultural, business, and civic venues. Metro Center includes Springfield's Central Business District, its Club Quarter, its government center, its convention headquarters, and in recent years, it has become an increasingly popular residential district, especially among young professionals, empty-nesters, and creative types, with a population of approximately 7,000 (2010.)\n\nAs of 2011, Metro Center includes approximately 690 acres of land where the city was initially established, aligned north–south, following the Connecticut River, and is bounded by Route 291 to the north, Union and Howard Streets to the south, Federal Street to the east and the Connecticut River to the west, although Metro Center is physically separated from the Connecticut River by Interstate 91 – a 1958 urban renewal project that separated the city from its riverfront.\n\nMetro Center, founded in 1636 by William Pynchon and a group of pioneers, was originally called \"Agawam Plantation\". At the time of its founding, Agawam Plantation was the northernmost settlement on the Connecticut River, and belonged to the Connecticut Colony as opposed to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, to which it would later belong. Within less than a decade after its founding in 1636, differences arose between the leaders of Agawam (Springfield) and Newtown (Hartford) over how to treat the region's Native population. Springfield hoped to pursue peaceful relations with the Natives so as to better facilitate trade and communal farming, whereas Hartford – and many of Connecticut's early settlers – had fought the bloody Pequot War to claim their territory, and thus took a more skeptical view of the Native population. This difference of opinion led to Agawam (Springfield) annexing itself to Massachusetts in 1640. At that time, William Pynchon was named magistrate of the settlement, and the town's name was changed to Springfield in Pynchon's honor. (Pynchon was from Springfield, Essex.)\n\nMetro Center Springfield was founded on the Connecticut River, just north of the River's first falls unnavigable by seagoing vessels, (the Enfield Falls.) Thus, in founding Springfield, the business-minded Pynchon assured that all northern river trade and travel ran through Springfield. In early colonial days, Springfield was the dominant trading post on the Connecticut River.\n\nIn 1675, during King Philip's War. the Metacomet-led Attack on Springfield burned over 75% of Springfield, which was only Metro Center, including the saw and grist mills. Following King Philip's War, thought was given to abandoning the settlement at Springfield; however, luckily, cooler heads prevailed and the settlement remained.\n\nIn 1777, noting Springfield's location on a major U.S. river, fertile farmland, and close proximity to Boston, Albany, New York City, and Montreal, George Washington and Henry Knox founded the U.S. National Arsenal at Springfield on a tall bluff overlooking Metro Center. Subsequently, Springfield developed neighborhoods other than Metro Center.\n\nIn 1813, the green in the middle of Metro Center was officially named Court Square. Court Square had been the center of public and social life since the times when Native Americans roamed freely through Springfield's streets (pre-King Philip's War,) and continued to be so until the building of Springfield's first train station in the 1830s.\n\nThe arrival of the railroad to Springfield in the 1830s brought great wealth to the city, again, due to its location. Goods from New York, Boston, Chicago, and even as far west as San Francisco travelled through Springfield on their ways to coastal distribution centers. Springfield, rather than Hartford, or Northampton, or Greenfield, became Western New England's railroad hub, perhaps due to the presence of the Springfield Armory, but more likely due to the city's growing reputation for ingenuity, and that it served as a nearly equidistant point between Albany and Boston, Providence, and New York.\n\nMetro Center features the majority of Western Massachusetts' most important cultural institutions. For example, it features the Springfield Armory National Park, which includes a museum featuring the world's largest historic firearm collection. A block west of the Armory is the Quadrangle, which includes an extraordinary grouping of world-class and regional museums, each with a different focus. The Quadrangle features the George Walter Vincent Smith Museum, which is known worldwide for having the largest collection of Chinese cloisonné outside of China. It also features the Museum of Fine Arts, which features a particularly strong European Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection, including paintings by Monet, Degas, and Gauguin, among others. The American Collection features works by Springfielder James McNeill Whistler. The Springfield Science Museum features the first-ever American planetarium (built 1937,) Dinosaur Hall, and a live animal center. The Quadrangle's two regional museums are the Connecticut River Valley History Museum, the most extensive compilation of information on the historic valley and its people; and the new Wood Museum of Springfield History, which showcases Springfield as \"The City of Firsts\" in the context of American History.\n\nSpringfield Symphony Hall at Court Square features famously \"perfect acoustics,\" and frequent performances by the innovative Springfield Symphony Orchestra. It also features traveling performances of Broadway shows. Also, close by, the Community Music School of Springfield, located at 127 State Street, features musical programs during the day and evenings. Across the street, the MassMutual Center features arena-scale rock concerts, conventions, and is home to Springfield's professional sports team, the American Hockey League's Springfield Thunderbirds.\n\nWithin close walking distance are Rascal's, a comedy club at 1 Monarch Place, and Springfield's famous City Stage playhouse – a tiny modern playhouse that produces a range of works from philosophical modern plays, to Shakespeare, to children's entertainment. If you plan an excursion to City Stage, it is best to check ahead to see if what's showing meets your tastes.\n\nThe area surrounding Stearns Square has been Springfield' Club Quarter for over 120 years. As of 2011, Springfield's Club Quarter continues to expand, now featuring over 70 clubs, bars, restaurants, and even historic gathering places. For an example of the latter, the Duryea brothers built the first American gasoline-powered car at a still existent building on Taylor Street – one of the few buildings in the district at that time, which was not a bar or club. An 1893 model Duryea stands in a small park outside of what is today Alumni Club at 90 Worthington Street, mere feet from the historically important Duryea shop. Springfield's most popular bars and clubs are an eclectic mix, featuring Skyplex, a three-level bar and club directly on Stearns Square; Theodore's – voted America's best blues club; Oz, one of Springfield's five LGBT clubs and bars, (not counting the numerous clubs and bars that sponsor LGBT nights;) Shekago's, a martini bar featuring live jazz and piano-playing; and Fat Cat's Bar & Grill, which features punk, industrial, and other live rock bands. In Springfield's Club Quarter, many different \"scenes\" co-mingle peaceably, including hip-hop, rock, LGBT, jazz, strip clubs for both men and women, and blues.\n\nThe restaurants and clubs by the Basketball Hall of Fame also feature live music (Pizzeria Uno's, Mama Iguana's,) Las Vegas-style shows (Pazzo's,) and of course, several sports bars, such as Samuel's and Max's Tavern.\n\nEven by urban New England standards, where downtowns are frequently walkable like those in Europe, Springfield's is exceptionally so. It is composed of mixed-use residential, commercial, and institutional organizations. A majority of its buildings were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s, giving it a Victorian look; however, there are numerous skyscrapers as well. Metro Center is cut off from the Connecticut Riverfront by Interstate 91, an 8-lane highway. Across Interstate 91 sits the Basketball Hall of Fame complex, Springfield's largest tourist draw.\n\nFrom 1908 until 1971, Springfield was subject to a skyline height limit – imposed by the Massachusetts State Legislature – of 125 feet, and thus Springfield has a relatively lower skyline than comparable cities of its population and economic and cultural importance. This trait is now looked on as a positive by developers at the Urban Land Institute, who have written \"Metro Center now stands out from its peers, most of which long ago demolished the human-scale architecture that made their downtowns livable.\" During Springfield's resurgence in the new millennium, prominent architects – like Moshe Safdie, who built the $57 million, 2008 U.S. Federal Court Building; Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, who built the $47 million, 2004 Basketball Hall of Fame; and TRO Jung Brannen, who are building the $110 million, 2012 adaptive reuse of Springfield's original Technical High School – adapted to Springfield's human-scale to a create monumental buildings rather than attempting to \"achieve monumentalism through over-scaling,\" as has happened in other cities.\n\nIn 2012, Springfield's 1926 Union Station will receive a $75 million renovation (including $4 million pledged by Connecticut) to become an intermodal transportation center, with Peter Pan Bus' headquarters, PVTA's headquarters, and Greyhound all relocating to the new facility. This project will coincide with the start-up of Springfield's two new rail lines: the $1 billion, southbound Springfield Hartford New Haven rail line, which will reportedly reach speeds up to 110 mph, making it the United States' first true \"high-speed\" train; and the $80 million, northbound Knowledge Corridor Intercity Commuter Rail, which will connect Springfield with its northern neighbors along the Connecticut River (e.g. Northampton, Massachusetts) and terminate in Brattleboro, Vermont. Ultimately, this renovation of the old Montrealer line will take passengers to Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n\nWhile billions of dollars are funding Springfield's north–south rail expansion, a more modest, combined $25 million recently improved Springfield's two main thoroughfares, Main Street and State Street. Both now feature artistic crosswalks and ornate streetlights, which add to the eclectic and increasingly whimsical atmosphere of Metro Center. Unfortunately, the 2011 Greater Springfield tornado reversed much of Main Street's progress.\n\nMetro Center provides quick access to I-91 and I-291, both of which connect to I-90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike), making trips to Boston, Albany, New York City, Montreal, Hartford, Worcester, and New Haven convenient by car. This convenience, however, came at a steep price to Springfielders: hasty, poor urban planning decisions during 1958 created the now elevated I-91 viaduct along the Connecticut River, which essentially cut off Springfield from the Connecticut, the parks surrounding it, and the Basketball Hall of Fame complex, preventing foot traffic and resulting in untold losses of tourist dollars among other losses. In 2010, Boston's Urban Land Institute proposed a vision for Springfield's riverfront; however, as of 2011, Interstate 91 remains a physical barrier between Springfield, the Connecticut River, and the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nThe position of I-91 and its blockage of the Connecticut River – along with the cement covering of the Mill River – are challenges that Springfield officials say they plan on addressing in upcoming years.\n\nRecent academic papers have documented negative economic and sociological effects of I-91's placement in Springfield – it has fragmented three neighborhoods, inhibited the economic growth of Springfield's most valuable land – on the Riverfront and around the Basketball Hall of Fame – and essentially made the river inaccessible to people as a place for recreation and tourism. Recent city planning polls rate Springfield's I-91 among the worst urban planning decisions made by an American city. The highway's inhibiting effects on riverfront development were exacerbated during the 1980s and 1990s, when giant, above-grade highway parking lots were built underneath I-91, and later when earthen, grassy mounds and 20-foot limestone walls were constructed around large sections of it, blocking all but the tallest Metro Center buildings' views of the Connecticut River, and discouraging economic and social interaction between Metro Center and the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nMetro Center's housing stock was, for centuries, Springfield's most prized. As of 2011, it is fast regaining that status among people attracted to urban living without the expense – bohemians, artists, empty-nesters, and LGBT residents have constituted the first wave of Metro Center's recolonization, which began only during the new millennium. Housing stock consists of various architectural styles, from detached Victorian houses and attached red-brick row-houses in the Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District, to historic buildings adaptively re-used or renovated into condominiums, artists' lofts, and rental properties in the Apremont Triangle Historic District. Notable examples include a former 4-star Sheraton hotel, (The Kimball Towers;) a famous, Victorian high school (Classical High School Condominiums;) an architecturally significant factory (The McIntosh;) and a renovated art deco apartment building, (Pearl Street Luxury Condos.) Rental properties include the adaptive re-use of the former Milton Bradley toy factory, now called Stockbridge Court, as well as the adaptive re-use of the former YMCA building, 122 Chestnut Street. Major construction projects like the $101 million adaptive re-use of Springfield's original Technical High School for Massachusetts' Data Center; the $57 million Moshe Safdie-designed, architecturally award-winning Federal Courthouse; and Baystate Health's $300 million \"Hospital of the Future,\" have all contributed to Metro Center's resurgence.\n\nThe Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District is one of the few neighborhoods in the Knowledge Corridor that remains lined with historic, restored red-brick Victorian row houses on both sides, and shaded by tree canopies. The Mattoon Street neighborhood features some of Springfield's most prestigious residential addresses, on Mattoon Street, Salem Street, Elliot Street, and others. It also features one of renowned architect H.H. Richardson's first works in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, the current Hispanic Baptist Church. Early each Fall, the neighborhood hosts a large arts festival, \"The Mattoon Street Arts Festival.\"\n\nMetro Center features Springfield's and Western Massachusetts' most prominent civic institutions, including the Greek Revival Springfield City Hall, the Springfield School Board, the Hampden County Courthouse and Richardsonian Romanesque Juvenile Courthouse, designed by H.H. Richardson himself. Springfield's ornate, neo-classical Springfield Municipal Group, dedicated by U.S. President William Howard Taft, features a 300 ft. tall Italianate campanile that towers over Court Square. Other prominent civic buildings include \"starchitect\" Moshe Safdie's new, $57 million, architecturally award-winning Federal Courthouse on State Street, and Massachusetts' new $110 million Data Center, an adaptive re-use of Springfield's original Technical High School. The Springfield School Board recently moved into modern, $11 million renovated office space 1550 Main Street.\n\nThe City of Springfield's palatial Public Library is located in Metro Center. It features the second largest library circulation in New England (behind Boston's.) Metro Center also features three higher learning institutions: Cambridge College at Tower Square, the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Urban Design Center at Court Square, and Springfield Technical Community College, which enrolls over 6500 students.\n\nMetro Center is the central business district of Western Massachusetts, featuring numerous international, national, regional, and local businesses and headquarters. 17,000 businesspeople work in Metro Center. Businesses include the Fortune 100 MassMutual Financial, Peter Pan Bus, Hampden Bank, NuVo Bank, Merriam Webster, Liberty Mutual, Verizon, the American Hockey League, the Northeastern headquarters of TD Banknorth, Health New England, Peoples' United Bank, United Personnel staffing, numerous attorneys, architects, accountants, other professionals, and hundreds of businesses.

Regardless, if one can make it there, it affords beautiful views of the river, valley, skyline, and mountains surrounding them all.\n"}

Like other traditional engineering, software development deals with the problems of cost and reliability.\nIt is also a practice of hiring an external organization to perform some business functions in a country other than a customer’s country.\n\nOffshore software development can include following services: product design and architecture, coding and testing; develops SaaS, Internet/Intranet solutions, e-commerce, CRM, project management and other special web-services (including Web 2.0 solutions).\n\nThe leaders in offshore custom software development are Russia, India, Ukraine and China. Its business case should contain information covering five key aspects: strategic fit, options appraisal, commercial aspects, affordability and achievability.\n\nGiven the rapid growth of this sector, several companies have started to use offshore development in China, India and other countries with a lower cost per developer model. Several new Web 2.0 platforms and sites are now developed offshore while the entrepreneurs and management is located in Western countries such as US, UK and EU. The advantages mostly revolve around better cost-control over the process, which means that there is lower cash-outflow (often the biggest struggle for startups). Furthermore, the time difference when working with India and China for the Western world allows work to be done round the clock adding a competitive advantage. Notable firms that are involved in development include Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, and Satyam.\n\n"}

The principals and namesakes were John D. Rockefeller, William Rockefeller, Samuel Andrews, and Henry M. Flagler. Flagler’s step-brother Stephen V. Harkness made substantial investments, but was a silent partner and did not take an active role in running the business but he was actually the second largest stockholder next to JD Rockefeller.\n\nBy 1868, Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler was the largest petroleum refiner in the world. The partners are credited with recognizing the importance of utilizing and marketing all of the by-products of the refining process, and gaining market and pricing control through shipping rates. In a contract signed on June 4, 1868, Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler along with Cleveland's other two largest oil refiners - Clark, Payne & Company; and Westlake, Hutchins & Company - were given a 25% of the interest in the Allegheny Transportation Company in return for $1. The Allegheny Transportation Company at this time was controlled by Jay Gould. This stock was worth $62,222. Their failed South Improvement Company scheme in 1871 in secret collusion with the Pennsylvania Railroad led independent producers to revolt in western Pennsylvania in early 1872 and earned Rockefeller, the highest profile partner, much bad public opinion. \n\nHowever, the partners deployed other more successfully calculated and forceful approaches, which included buying out the competition and the formation of the various Standard Oil companies. By 1879, the Standard Oil Company did about 90 percent of the oil refining in the United States.\n\n"}

{"id": "6953277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6953277", "title": "Skid Row, Los Angeles", "text": "Skid Row, Los Angeles\n\nSkid Row is an area of Downtown Los Angeles. As of the 2000 census, the population of the district was 17,740. Skid Row was defined in a decision in \"Jones v. City of Los Angeles\" as the area east of Main Street, south of Third Street, west of Alameda Street, and north of Seventh Street. Skid Row contains one of the largest stable populations (between 5,000 and 8,000) of homeless people in the United States.\n\nThe term \"skid row\" or \"skid road\", referring to an area of a city where people live who are \"on the skids\", derives from a logging term. Loggers would transport their logs to a nearby river by sliding them down roads made from greased skids. Loggers who had accompanied the load to the bottom of the road would wait there for transportation back up the hill to the logging camp. By extension, the term began to be used for places where people with no money and nothing to do gathered, becoming the generic term for a depressed street in a city.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, a number of residential hotels opened in the area as it became home to a transient population of seasonal laborers. By the 1930s, Skid Row was home to as many as 10,000 homeless people, alcoholics, and others on the margins of society. It supported saloons, residential hotels, and social services, which drew people from the populations they served to congregate in the area.\n\nIn June 1947, LAPD chief Clemence B. Horrall ordered what he called a \"blockade raid\" of the whole Skid Row area. Over 350 people were arrested. Assistant Chief Joseph Reed, who claimed that \"at least 50 percent of all the crime in Los Angeles originates in the Skid Row area,\" stated that there had been no \"strong arm robberies\" on Skid Row as late as one week after the raid. Long time residents, however, were skeptical that the changes would last.\n\nIn 1956, the city of Los Angeles was in the midst of a program to \"rehabilitate\" Skid Row through the clearance of decaying buildings. The program was presented to property owners in the area as an economy measure. Gilbert Morris, then superintendent of building, said that at that point the provision of free social services to the approximately one square mile of Skid Row cost the city over $5 million per year as opposed to the city average of $110,000 per square mile annually. The city used administrative hearings to compel the destruction of nuisance properties at the expense of the owner. By July 1960, the clearance program was said to be 87% complete in the Skid Row area.\n\nIn the 1970s, two Catholic Workers — Catherine Morris, a former nun, and her husband, Jeff Dietrich — founded the \"Hippie Kitchen\" in the back of a van. Forty years later, in April 2014, aged 80 and 68, they remained active in their work feeding Skid Row residents.\n\nIn February 1987, LAPD chief Daryl Gates, backed by then-Mayor Tom Bradley, announced plans for another crackdown on the homeless on Skid Row. Police and firefighters conducted a number of sweeps through the area but the plan was abandoned due to opposition by advocates for the homeless.\n\nWhen Gates announced in May that the crackdown would resume, Los Angeles City Attorney (and future mayor) James K. Hahn responded that he would not prosecute people arrested in the planned sweeps. Hahn stated that he was \"not going to prosecute individuals for not having a place to stay. I simply will not prosecute people for being poor, underprivileged and unable to find a place to sleep until I'm convinced that a viable alternative to sleeping on the streets exists.\" Gates, still backed by Bradley, responded: \"As the elected city attorney of Los Angeles, Mr. Hahn has a responsibility to file prosecutable cases which are presented to him by the Los Angeles Police Department.\"\n\nA few days later, then-Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky introduced a proposal that the city stop enforcing its anti-camping laws on Skid Row until adequate housing could be found for all its residents. The council rejected Yaroslavsky's proposal, but after hearing testimony from Assistant Police Chief David Dotson describing the LAPD's intended crackdown methodology, the council passed a motion asking Gates not to enforce the anti-camping laws until adequate housing could be found for the area's residents.\n\nIn September 2005, hospitals and law enforcement agencies were discovered to be \"dumping\" homeless people on Skid Row. Then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ordered an investigation and William Bratton, LAPD chief at the time, claimed that the department was not targeting homeless people specifically, but only people who violate city ordinances. The Los Angeles City Attorney investigated more than 50 of about 150 reported cases of dumping. By early 2007, the city attorney had filed charges against only one hospital, Kaiser Permanente. Because there were no laws specifically covering the hospital's actions, it was charged, in an untested strategy, with false imprisonment. In response to the lack of legal recourse available to fight patient dumping, California state senator Gil Cedillo sponsored legislation against it in February 2007.\n\nIn 2002, newly appointed LAPD chief William Bratton announced a plan to clean up Skid Row by, among other things, aggressively enforcing an old anti-camping ordinance. Robert Lee Purrie, for instance, was cited twice for violating the ordinance in December 2002 and January 2003 and his possessions: \"blankets, clothes, cooking utensils, a hygiene kit,\" and so on, were confiscated by the police.\n\nIn April 2006, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of the ACLU in its suit against the city of Los Angeles, filed on behalf of Purrie and five other homeless people, finding that the city was in violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and sections of the California Constitution guaranteeing due process and equal protection and prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. The court stated that \"the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row.\" The court said that the anti-camping ordinance is \"one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States.\"\n\nThe ACLU sought a compromise in which the LAPD would be barred from arresting homeless people or confiscating their possession on Skid Row between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. The compromise plan, which was accepted by the city of Los Angeles, permits sleeping on the sidewalk except \"within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance\" and only between these hours.\n\nDowntown development business interests and the Central City East Association (CCEA) came out against the compromise. On September 20, 2006, Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise. On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets for the first time in months. On October 10, 2006, under pressure from the ACLU, the city tacitly agreed to the compromise by declining to appeal the court's decision.\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 17,740 people and 2,410 households residing in the neighborhood. The population density was 4,111/mi². The 2017 racial makeup of the neighborhood was 12% White, 62% African American, 1% Native American, 1% Asian, 21% Hispanic or Latino, 0.3% Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander, and 2% from other races. \n\nIn the neighborhood the population was spread out with 9.8% under the age of 18, 54.7% from 18 to 34, 39.9% from 35 to 64, and 4.6% who were 65 years of age or older.\n\nThe per capita income for the neighborhood was $14,210. About 41.8% of the population were below the poverty line.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) serves the neighborhood with Station No. 3 in the Business District, one in the West and Station No. 9 in Skid Row. Station No. 9 operates one engine, one truck, two ALS rescue ambulances, and one BLS rescue ambulance. It currently is the busiest firehouse in Los Angeles. Fire engines and ambulances serving the neighborhood have historically had \"Skid Row\" emblazoned on their sides. On June 1, 2006, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that fire officials planned to change the legend on the vehicles to read \"Central City East\". Many residents supported the change, but it was opposed by firefighters and some residents who take pride in the sense that they live in a tough area.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Health Services operates the Central Health Center in Downtown Los Angeles, serving Skid Row.\n\nServices for homeless people in Los Angeles are centralized in Skid Row. Examples include the Volunteers of America, the Union Rescue Mission, The Jonah Project, Downtown Mental Health (a branch of the Department of Mental Health), LAMP, Downtown Women's Center, The Weingart Foundation, Los Angeles Mission, Fred Jordan Mission, The Society of St. Vincent de Paul's Cardinal Manning Center, and Midnight Mission. In 2007, Union Rescue Mission opened Hope Gardens, a facility outside of Skid Row which is exclusively for women and children.\n\n\nThe site has appeared as a location in several movies, including \"The Sting\", and television shows such as \"Starsky & Hutch\", \"Baretta\", and \"Quincy ME\". The 1960 comedy horror film \"The Little Shop of Horrors\" is set in Skid Row; however, the location of the 1982 musical (and its 1986 film adaptation) was moved to New York City (although the song \"Skid Row (Downtown)\" exists in both). \n\nSkid Row was also used as a location for filming the music video for the Michael Jackson song \"Beat It\".\n\nThe heavy metal band Skid Row was named after this area.\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey mentions the area in her 2012 song Cola, in the lyric \"I wear my diamonds on Skid Row.\"\n\nElectronic artist James Ferraro's album Skid Row is conceptualized around the area.\n\n\nThe community is served primarily by 10 Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus lines:\n\nLine 16/316 — Downtown Los Angeles to Century City \"(via Fifth and Sixth streets)\"\n\nLine 18 — Koreatown to Montebello \"(via Fifth and Sixth streets)\"\n\nLine 20 — Downtown Los Angeles to Westwood \"(via Seventh Street)\"\n\nLine 51 — Compton to Wilshire/Vermont Station \"(via Seventh and San Pedro streets)\"\n\nLine 52/352 — Harbor Gateway Transit Center to Wilshire/Vermont Station \"(via Seventh Street, San Pedro Street, and Avalon Boulevard)\"\n\nLine 53 — California State University, Dominguez Hills to Downtown Los Angeles \"(via Fifth and Sixth streets)\"\n\nLine 60 — Artesia Station to Downtown Los Angeles \"(via Seventh Street)\"\n\nLine 62 — Hawaiian Gardens to Downtown Los Angeles \"(via Fifth and Sixth streets)\"\n\nMetro Rapid Line 720 — Commerce to Santa Monica \"(via Fifth and Sixth streets)\"\n\nMetro Rapid Line 760 — Artesia Station to Downtown Los Angeles \"(via Seventh Street)\"\n\n\n\n"}

The fourth of six children, he was baptised on 5 June 1835 in St James's Church, Trowbridge.\n\nOn 27 March 1855, Solomon married Mary Asher (20 August 1832 – 18 January 1870), daughter of John and Mary Asher, in Trinity Church, Trowbridge. There were five children from the marriage but only two survived infancy:\n\nHis second wife, whom he married on 15 June 1870 in Knighton Parish Church, was Mary Jane Udell (born 2 March 1849) of Wrexham. There were six children from this marriage:\n\nBy 1851 Andrews was living in Cardiff, at 17 Tredegar Street, and working as a baker and confectioner. The house was owned by George and Charlotte Asher, George being a baker and confectioner, so Solomon was presumably learning the trade.\n\nOn 24 November 1856 he leased a shop and house at 51 James Street. \n\nOn 17 December 1863 he obtained a licence to operate a horse-drawn cab from the new residential districts of Canton and Roath to Cardiff Docks. By 1865, he had eight cabs and he is thought to have been an omnibus proprietor by December 1866.\n\nHis business interests grew rapidly to include tramways, buses, draperies and collieries.\n\nHis son Francis Emile (1858–1943) joined the company and eventually became a partner, the business becoming known as \"Solomon Andrews and Son\",\n\nHe was best known for the Andrews Star Omnibus Company and the Star Omnibus Company (London) which provided horse-drawn bus services in London. His company also ran buses in:\n\n\n \nIn 1894 he purchased an area near Arthog consisting of several farms. He developed three terraces of houses, including St Mary's Terrace, Arthog Terrace, and Mawddach Crescent. \n\nMawddach Crescent was a row of properties overlooking the Mawddach estuary. The Crescent was connected to Barmouth Junction railway station by the short-lived Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway which he constructed. Andrews intended this to be the start of a purpose-built holiday resort but the surrounding land proved unsuitable for further construction. In 1941, during the Second World War, the Crescent was commandeered by the Royal Marines. It was renamed Camp Iceland and used as a training facility.\n\nSt Mary's Terrace in Arthog was also served by the Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway.\n\nAndrews purchased land here and started work by fencing off some of it. However, this provoked trouble locally as public rights of way were affected, so no development ever took place. The land was later sold to the local authority.\n\nAndrews undertook the rebuilding of 10 Bute Street (now Hayes Bridge Road) in 1871. This building was intended to be a grocery and confectionery shop and the headquarters of the Solomon Andrews and Son firm.\n\nIn the 1870s the expansion of his omnibus business led to the acquisition of new sites for depots. A freehold site was purchased at Severn Road, Canton, in 1875, and a manager's house, bus shed, stables and workshops was constructed.\n\nIn 1875, he also undertook work on a leasehold site at Glebe Street, Penarth. In 1880 he built a tram car depot at the junction of Ferry Road and Clive Street, Grangetown. This was for the Cardiff District and Penarth Harbour Tramway Company which opened in 1881. \n\nBetween 1881–83 Andrews built five houses and shops, five cottages and Windsor Hall in Holmesdale Street, and some houses in Earl Street. Andrews Terrace in Ferry Road, consisting of sixteen houses and a coffee tavern, was also constructed at around the same time.\n\nIn 1884 he constructed the Market Buildings in St Mary Street, Cardiff at a cost of some £12,000. Sadly this building was destroyed by fire in June 1885, and it had been replaced by September 1886, the new building being constructed with eight-inch-thick concrete flooring to prevent further fires.\n\nIn 1885 in James Street he began construction of Mercantile Buildings which survived until demolished in the 1970s during a road widening scheme.\n\nIn 1888 Andrews completed the Imperial Buildings on St Mary Street, Cardiff, which became known as Barry's Hotel. \n\nHe also built two streets of housing which were named Mary Street and Solomon Street (later renamed Andrews Road), and was involved in the construction of warehouses on the southern side of Penarth Road, as well as between Crawshay Lane (now Curran Road) and Trade Street. Terraced houses were built from the corner of Blaenclydach Street south-westwards along Penart Road in 1891 to designs by the architect E.W.M. Corbett. \n\nThe Atlas, or Hayes, Building was erected around 1893 and this survived until destroyed by fire in 1958. \n\nIn 1894 Andrews constructed residential property from 75 to 113 Penarth Road, and the Andrews' Buildings on Queen Street to designs by the architect Edward Webb.\n\nIn 1895 the firm started building work in Penarth. Andrews' Buildings (Penarth), erected in 1896, consisted of five shops fronting Stanwell Road, a corner shop and two shops in Windsor Terrace. In 1897 the company built Lloyds Bank on the corner of Windsor Road and Albert Road to designs by the architect Edward Webb. This was followed by the Windsor Arcade, a row of shops on Windsor Road. \n\nAround 1900 Metropole Buildings, 3–7 The Hayes, Cardiff was erected. This building was badly damaged by an air raid in the Second World War, but was reconstructed in 1959. \n\nNumbers,11, 12, and 13 Bute Street (now Hayes Bridge Road) were rebuilt in 1902 to designs by the architect Lennox Robertson. Andrews also constructed Pembroke Buildings on Pembroke Terrace in the same year, using the architect E.W.M. Corbett.\n\nIn Pwllheli, Andrews was responsible for the development of the West End holiday resort, which included a promenade, housing, roads, a recreation ground, golf course, and the West End Hotel. The stone required to build the West End was provided by a local quarry that he leased at Carreg-y-defaid. The company constructed the Pwllheli and Llanbedrog Tramway, which carried the stone and passengers.\n\nThe West End Hotel was constructed first, along with large houses numbered 1–4 The Parade. The hotel was probably completed by 1895 and the houses in 1896. The construction was mostly in concrete, with the joinery being provided by his workshops in Cardiff and delivered to Pwllheli by rail. \n\nFurther building work was undertaken in 1897 when plans for nos 5–10 The Parade were approved by the council. Nos 11–16 followed quickly afterwards and all were completed by 1899.\n\nConstruction of housing and shops in Cardiff Road was undertaken between 1897 and 1901. A power station was erected next to the Assembly Rooms behind the West End Hotel, to provide electrical power for the West End Hotel.\n\n"}

A stakeholder is any individual, group or organization that can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a programme. Stakeholder management creates positive relationships with stakeholders through the appropriate management of their expectations and agreed objectives. Stakeholder management is a process and control that must be planned and guided by underlying principles. Stakeholder management within businesses, organizations, or projects prepares a strategy using information (or intelligence) gathered during the following common processes.\n\nThe first step in your stakeholder analysis is to brainstorm who your stakeholders are. As part of this, think of all the people who are affected by your work, who have influence or power over it, or have an interest in its successful or unsuccessful conclusion. Remember that although stakeholders may be both organizations and people, ultimately you must communicate with people. Make sure that you identify the correct individual stakeholders within a stakeholder organization. \n\nSo in a nutshell, the stakeholder management comprises four steps:\n\n\nYou may now have a long list of people and organizations that are affected by your work. Some of these may have the power either to block or advance. Some may be interested in what you are doing, others may not care. Map out your stakeholders on a Power/Interest Grid, and classify them by their power over your work and by their interest in your work. There are other tools available to map out your stakeholders and how best to influence them.\n\nFor example, your boss is likely to have high power and influence over your projects and high interest. Your family may have high interest, but are unlikely to have power over it. Someone's position on the grid shows you the actions you have to take with them:\n\nYou now need to know more about your key stakeholders. You need to know how they are likely to feel about and react to your project. You also need to know how best to engage them in your project and how best to communicate with them. Key questions that can help you understand your stakeholders are:\n\n\nSource: \n\nIt is well acknowledged that any given organization will have multiple stakeholders including, but not limited to, customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and so forth. Within the field of marketing, it is believed that customers are one of the most important stakeholders for managing its long-term value, with a firm's major objective being the management of customer satisfaction.\n\nWith a clear understanding of your Stakeholders, engaging and communicating can be achieved through a variety of channels based upon who the stakeholder is.\n\n\n"}

The book has appeared on the best seller lists of \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"USA Today\", and Amazon.com. The book was first published by Bard Press on April 1, 2013.\n\nGary Keller is the co-founder and Chairman of the Board at Keller Williams Realty, which is one of the world's largest real estate companies. Jay Papasan is the Vice President of publishing at Keller Williams. Prior to the publication of \"The ONE Thing\" in 2013, the two collaborated on \"The Millionaire Real Estate\" series of books which discussed how to invest in and earn money from real estate properties. \"The ONE Thing\" is the duo's first book that is not specifically focused on real estate. Instead, it discusses the general business principle of choosing a single task to work on to theoretically maximize the efficiency of that task and the overall project.\n\nThe book discusses the benefits of prioritizing a single task, and it also provides examples of how to engage in those tasks with a singular focus. The book begins with a section entitled, \"The Lies: They Mislead and Derail Us,\" which analyzes the ways in which multitasking has erroneously been praised as a desirable trait. The authors also challenge the concept of \"work-life balance\", calling it \"[i]dealistic, but not realistic.\"\n\nThis then leads to the \"Focusing Question\" which asks \"What’s the ONE Thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?\" This second section of the book deals with productivity principles like habit-building and benchmarking. For instance, the book suggests that readers should engage in four hours of work on their \"ONE thing\" each day. The authors cite economist Vilfredo Pareto as one of the inspirations behind this philosophy. Pareto's principle suggested that 20% of the effort produces 80% of the results. According to the book, this means that engaging in the one most important task will be more likely to produce the desired results without any extraneous effort. The book also differentiates between the Big-Picture Question (\"What’s my ONE Thing?\") and the Small-Focus Question (\"What’s my ONE Thing right now?\"). The core idea is that focusing on an excessive amount of tasks will more likely lead to discord and under-performance.\n\nThe third section of the book discusses \"Extraordinary Results,\" which details how to make the above principles actionable. One of the concepts it illustrates is \"time blocking,\" which means that one should focus on only their ONE thing during a given amount of time. It also suggests that readers should schedule time to reflect, plan, and even relax. Everything else during scheduled time blocks is characterized as a distraction. Each section of the book is followed up by a \"Big Ideas\" review that gives a summary of the sections' concepts and principles.\n\n\"The ONE Thing\" garnered success both critically and commercially. It was listed as a best seller by \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"USA Today\", and Amazon.com. Hudson Booksellers listed it among their best \"Business Interest\" books of 2013. In an article for \"Entrepreneur\", Brandon Turner named \"The ONE Thing\" one of the \"5 Powerful Books That Changed the Direction of My Life.\" In a review for \"The National\", Alice Haine notes that the book \"has the necessary ingredients to boost those feeling a little overwhelmed by the pressures of work and home life.\" A review on Blogcritics states \"[t]his book will benefit management at virtually every level in an organization.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" noted that book had \"an appealing style and energy.\" It has won a total of 12 book awards and been translated into 26 languages. It was also voted one of the Top 100 Business Books of All Time on Goodreads.\n\n"}

All were originally government owned. In Victoria for instance, the State government owned Victorian Totalisator Agency Board began operating in March 1961.\n\nMost Australian TABs have been progressively privatised, beginning with Victoria in 1994.\n\nTABs in Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory and Tasmania were re-branded as UBET in 2015.\n\nThe TABs have extensive radio networks in Australia, except in Victoria and Tasmania where other parties own equivalent networks. All these networks share the National Racing Service, a continuous broadcast of thoroughbred, harness and greyhound racing. This makes up the bulk of these networks' content. Collectively, these networks own more radio licences than any other group in Australia – however, their terrestrial coverage is less than the ABC as they generally have tiny wattages.\n\nThe heir of the NSW TAB also owns a national racing subscription TV service. In New Zealand, the TAB owns a near-national free-to-air and national subscription TV service. Most New Zealanders can sit at their analogue TV with a standard aerial and watch racing.\n\nThe New Zealand TAB was replaced by the New Zealand Racing Board in 2003.\n\nRadio TAB is also used to live sports coverage (including horse racing) in parts of Australia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1001608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1001608", "title": "Variable cost", "text": "Variable cost\n\nVariable costs are costs that change in proportion to the good or service that a business produces. Variable costs are also the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also be considered normal costs. Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost. Direct costs, however, are costs that can easily be associated with a particular cost object. However, not all variable costs are direct costs. For example, variable manufacturing overhead costs are variable costs that are indirect costs, not direct costs. Variable costs are sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.\n\nDirect labor and overhead are often called conversion cost, while direct material and direct labor are often referred to as prime cost.\n\nIn marketing, it is necessary to know how costs divide between variable and fixed. This distinction is crucial in forecasting the earnings generated by various changes in unit sales and thus the financial impact of proposed marketing campaigns. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 60 percent responded that they found the \"variable and fixed costs\" metric very useful.\n\nThe level of variable cost is influenced by many factors, such as fixed cost, duration of project, uncertainty and discount rate. An analytical formula of variable cost as a function of these factors has been derived. It can be used to assess how different factors impact variable cost and total return in an investment.\n\nAssume a business produces clothing. A variable cost of this product would be the direct material, i.e., cloth, and the direct labor. If it takes one laborer 6 yards of cloth and 8 hours to make a shirt, then the cost of labor and cloth increases if two shirts are produced.\n\nThe amount of materials and labor that goes into each shirt increases in direct proportion to the number of shirts produced. In this sense, the cost \"varies\" as production varies.\n\nFor example, a firm pays for raw materials. When activity is decreased, less raw material is used, and so the spending for raw materials falls. When activity is increased, more raw material is used, and spending therefore rises. Note that the changes in expenses happen with little or no need for managerial intervention. These costs are variable costs.\n\nA company will pay for line rental and maintenance fees each period regardless of how much power gets used. And some electrical equipment (air conditioning or lighting) may be kept running even in periods of low activity. These expenses can be regarded as fixed. But beyond this, the company will use electricity to run plant and machinery as required. The busier the company, the more the plant will be run, and so the more electricity gets used. This extra spending can therefore be regarded as variable.\n\nIn retail the cost of goods is almost entirely a variable cost; this is not true of manufacturing where many fixed costs, such as depreciation, are included in the cost of goods.\n\nAlthough taxation usually varies with profit, which in turn varies with sales volume, it is not normally considered a variable cost.\n\nFor some employees, salary is paid on monthly rates, independent of how many hours the employees work. This is a fixed cost. On the other hand, the hours of hourly employees can often be varied, so this type of labour cost is a variable cost. The cost of material is a variable cost.\n"}
{"id": "46282707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46282707", "title": "Yves Bouvier", "text": "Yves Bouvier\n\nYves Bouvier (born 8 September 1963) is a Swiss businessman and art dealer best known for his role in the Bouvier Affair. He was the president of Natural Le Coultre, an international company specialized in the transportation, storage, scientific analysis, and conservation of works of art, luxurious goods and other collectibles. In September 2017, it emerged that Bouvier is under criminal investigation by Swiss authorities amid allegations that he may have evaded more than 100 million euros in taxes related to his cross-border art dealings. In February 2018, meanwhile, the Geneva Prosecutor reportedly opened a new criminal investigation into Bouvier relating to an indictment on charges of fraud.\n\nYves Bouvier is the son of Jean-Jacques Bouvier, owner of Natural Le Coultre, a 150-year-old company specialized in moving and storing goods. Yves Bouvier early developed an interest in art, and joined his father's company in the eighties.\n\nNatural Transports was formed in 1859 as a moving and furniture storage company. It later became Natural Le Coultre in 1901, when Albert-Maurice Natural joined Emile-Etienne Le Coultre to create A. Natural, Le Coultre & Cie. In 1946, Jean-Jacques Bouvier began an apprenticeship at Natural Le Coultre S.A. In 1983, the Bouvier family acquired Natural Le Coultre. In 1989, Jean-Jacques and Yves Bouvier formed Fine Art Transports Natural Le Coultre SA in Geneva. Yves Bouvier became assistant manager in 1995 and then managing director in 1997, selling the moving and furniture storage activities to a local company to focus the company on storing, moving, and preserving pieces of art. Yves Bouvier moved to Singapore in 2009 where he currently resides.\n\nIn 2005, Bouvier expanded his business model abroad by creating \"artistic hubs\" grouped into freeport facilities that offer services and rental facilities to art collectors, museums and companies, expanding into Singapore in 2010 and Luxembourg in 2014. There are plans to open a Shanghai facility in 2017.\n\nFor many years, Bouvier was known primarily as an art transporter. However, after 2010, he began to be associated with art sales, including some controversial cases involving alleged irregularities. First, in 2012 Bouvier was connected to a legal case involving a Canadian collector named Lorette Shefner. Shefner’s family claims that she was the victim of a complex fraud, whereby she was persuaded to sell a Soutine painting at a price far below market value, only to see the work later sold to the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC for a much higher price.\n\nIn a separate incident, de la Béraudière was linked to the high-profile criminal case of Wolfgang Beltracchi, a German forger convicted in 2011 of defrauding a number of collectors, including Daniel Filipacchi, of millions of dollars. Bouvier’s purported connections to Galerie Jacques de la Béraudière and his ownership of an off-shore entity called Diva Fine Arts led to Bouvier being connected to the Beltracchi case. He has denied any connection to Beltracchi and dismissed media coverage as uninformed speculation.\n\nOn 26 February 2015, Yves Bouvier was arrested in Monaco. He was accused by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev of defrauding him of hundreds of millions of dollars through the sale of 37 paintings over a ten-year period. Bouvier denied all accusations, argues that he first heard about the complaint was when he was arrested, and that the price of the paintings had been agreed by both parties.\n\nAccording to Forbes, Rybolovlev spent New Year's Eve with Sandy Heller, art adviser to hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen. Heller mentioned to Rybolovlev that Cohen had sold a Modigliani nude for $93.5 million to a \"mystery buyer\", alleging he didn’t know that the buyer was Bouvier. Rybolvlev had paid Bouvier $118 million. Rybolovlev filed for fraud and money laundering in Monaco nine days later, and persuaded Bouvier to meet him there to discuss payment details for a Mark Rothko painting, at which time he was arrested by eight policemen.\n\nOn 13 March 2015, Singapore's High Court ordered the global freezing of Bouvier’s assets, then lifted this decision 12 days later, ordering Rybolovlev to give a total of $100m guarantee of damages from his action against Bouvier, $20m in cash and an $80m guarantee on the Rothko No. 6 painting. On 21 August 2015, the Singapore Court of Appeal removed the freezing injunction, on the ground that the procedure launched by Rybolovlev amounted to an abuse of procedure. In March 2016, the High Court of Singapore dismissed Bouvier's attempt to suspend the civil suit filed in the territory against him by two companies linked to the Rybolovlev family trust, but the case was transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court, which deals specifically with cross-border commercial disputes. In May 2016, in an effort to gain a friendlier hearing, Bouvier’s lawyers filed an appeal against the High Court's ruling. Bouvier prefers to have the case heard in Switzerland. On 18 April 2017, the Singapore Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's decision, ruling that the case should be heard in Switzerland and ordering the action in Singapore to be stayed.\n\nAfter Rybolovlev had successfully obtained an injunction from Hong Kong’s High Court in July 2015, on 4 September, Bouvier had his assets in Hong Kong unfrozen. High Court recorder Jason Pow Wing-nin SC ordered the injunction against art dealer Bouvier and his Hong Kong company Mei Invest Limited to be lifted.\n\nIrregularities were found in Rybolovlev’s complaint against Bouvier: Rybolovlev, who had served eleven months in jail after his involvement in the murder of Evgeny Panteleymonov, was suspected of collusion with several senior Monegasque officials. Some believe he plotted against Bouvier with the help of Philippe Narmino, Minister of Justice, and Jean-Pierre Dreno, Prosecutor of Monaco. French newspapers Mediapart and Libération suggested that during a dinner in Gstaad, Rybolovlev, Narmino and Gérard Cohen may have discussed the details of the plot, only a few weeks before Bouvier was arrested. Additionally, HSBC has been accused of forgery and falsification of records that led to Bouvier's arrest in Monaco. Bouvier's defense has objected to Rybolovlev's lawyer, Tetiana Bersheda, serving as Rybolovlev's translator during questioning while also being the subject of a deposition as a witness in the same case.\n\nA former friend of the Rybolovlev family, Tania Rappo, was also charged alongside Bouvier, in her case with money laundering in relation to the fraud. Rappo later alleged that Tetiana Bersheda, lawyer of Rybolovlev, registered at the bar of Geneva, recorded a private conversation without authorization in order to obtain information that might help secure an indictment. However, Bersheda maintains that the recording was of a professional conversation only and, as such, permitted by Monaco law. In any event, the Monaco Justice has yet to make any decision in relation to Rappo's complaint and the charges against Rappo, based partly on the content of the conversation, remain pending. On 23 February 2016, Bersheda was also charged by Monaco court for violation of the privacy of Rappo. Dmitry Rybolovlev and his lawyer might be sentenced to up to 3 years of imprisonment. The procedure is pending.\n\nOn 14 September 2015, Bouvier was indicted on charges of concealed theft of two Picassos belonging to Catherine Hutin-Blay, step-daughter of Picasso, who claims that they were stolen from her collection. However, Bouvier demonstrated she received the amount of 8 million euros through a Liechtensteiner trust for their sales. The prosecution of Liechtenstein closed the case on 1 December 2015.\n\nIn September, Bouvier took legal action in New York against the consultant Sandy Heller, asking that he be questioned about his interactions with Rybolovlev. Bouvier wants Heller to reveal the advice he may have provided to Rybolovlev that may have unfairly implicated him in the criminal cases he currently faces in France and Monaco.\n\nA major article about the Bouvier Affair published in the New Yorker in February 2016 alleged that Bouvier was using the profits from his dealings with Rybolovlev to fund his ambitious plans for the Singapore Freeport. The article quotes a colleague of Bouvier as saying, \"...to build freeports you need to be a billionaire...Rybolovlev was the billionaire whose money was building the freeports.\" As to Bouvier's method of marking-up the price of the works he was selling, the article found that \"When a deal with the seller was in sight, Bouvier would then agree on his own price with Rybolovlev, which was often tens of millions of dollars higher,\" and provided the example of the sale of Picasso's \"Joueur de Flûte et Femme Nue\", which Bouvier sold to Rybolovlev for twenty-five million euros after having bought it the day before for just three and a half million euros.\n\nOn March 9, 2016, following the lead of European authorities, US Federal prosecutors opened an investigation into Bouvier, whom they described as \"one of the art world’s consummate insiders.\" In April 2016, Bouvier entered a new phase of his campaign to clear his name by hiring global PR group, CNC Communications & Network Consulting, part of French giant Publicis Groupe.\n\nIn November 2016, Sotheby's issued a pre-emptive suit in relation to the Salvator Mundi (Leonardo) painting, denying that it had ever been part of a scheme allegedly perpetrated by Bouvier to defraud both the sellers of the painting, and Rybolovlev. The \"New York Times\" subsequently published a major investigative report into the sale, asking whether the sellers of the Salvator Mundi \"were misled [by Sotheby's] to favor the Swiss dealer, a valued Sotheby’s client named Yves Bouvier.\"\n\nIn February 2017, it emerged in a report carried by Bloomberg that several of the works acquired by Yves Bouvier for the Rybolovlev family trust will likely be sold at substantial losses in auctions at Christie's. Rybolovlev's spokesman said at the time: \"The gulf between Christie’s estimates and the original purchase prices of the works is a further illustration of the unprecedented scale and audacity of the fraud that the plaintiffs allege was perpetrated by Mr. Bouvier.\"\n\nIn September 2017 it was reported that Swiss inland revenue blocked assets of Bouvier, as he is believed to owe CHF 165 Million in taxes \n\nIn 2004 Bouvier founded the company Art Culture Studio that organizes cultural events, restores furniture, and provides support to the Renaissance Foundation for Russian Country Homes, a non-profit organization that supports research on the restoration of cultural and historic buildings in rural areas.. He initiated and chaired the Moscow World Fine Art and the Salzburg World Fine Art Fair. In 2008, Bouvier initiated the creation of the Singapore Pinacothèque de Paris, an expansion of Pinacothèque de Paris. According to its website, \"The museum in Singapore mirrors that of France, a fine art museum known for its critically acclaimed exhibitions that celebrate transversality and the dialogue between different works of art\".\n\nBouvier was involved with the \"pôle R4\" project, an artistic \"micro-city\" on the site of a former Renault factory in Seguin Island, Paris. The project, designed by French architect Jean Nouvel, was until September 2016 managed and financed by Bouvier, and was scheduled to open in 2017. In September 2016 it was announced that Bouvier had sold his entire stake to the Emerige Group and its financial partner, Addax and Oryx Group Limited (AOG). Artnet noted that the transaction frees the project from its association from Bouvier.\n"}
