He is also known by his initials, A. J. Munby.\n\nArthur Munby was born in York. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 1851, and was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn in 1855. He worked as a civil servant in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners' office from 1858 until his retirement in 1888. His published poetry included \"Benoni\" (1852) and \"Verses New and Old\" (1865). He taught Latin at the Working Men's College for more than a decade and helped promote the Working Men's College Volunteer Corps, a response to the national call for Volunteer Rifle Corps (1859) to combat a perceived threat from Napoleon the Third. Munby penned verses of support, the \"Invicta: a Song of 1860\", for the 19th Middlesex Regiment, a regiment to which the W.M.C.V.C. was attached. In 1864, a sister Working Women's College was established; Munby was a leading spirit of, and teacher at, the new college.\n\nMunby had a lifelong fascination with working-class women, particularly those who did hard physical labour. His favourite pastime was wandering the streets of London and other industrial cities where he approached working women to ask about their lives and the details of their work, while noting their clothes and dialects. The observations were recorded in his journals.\n\nHe was an amateur artist, and his diaries contain sketches of working women. He collected hundreds of photographs of women who worked at collieries, kitchen maids, milkmaids, charwomen, acrobats and so on. His diaries and images provide historical information on the lives of working-class Victorian women. Much of his obsession is hinted at in his last book, \"Faithful Servants: being epitaphs and obituaries recording their names and services\" (1891).\n\nHis papers are housed at Trinity College, Cambridge, there is a list of his papers on the Cambridge Janus website\n\nIn 1854, while on one of his urban wanderings, Munby met Hannah Cullwick, a Shropshire-born maid-of-all-work. They formed a relationship in which Munby was the master and Cullwick the slave, with him training her in the virtues of hard work and loyalty. His scenarios included elements of ageplay and infantilism, with Cullwick holding him in her lap or carrying him.\n\nThey married secretly in 1873 but Cullwick resisted his efforts to make her into a lady and she lived with him as a domestic servant, not a wife. She played the role of a lady wife on trips to Europe. They separated in 1877, but continued to see each other until Cullwick's death in 1909. The marriage was secret from all but a few close friends; he revealed it to his brother only a few months before his own death from pneumonia.\n\n"}
{"id": "56669014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56669014", "title": "Bleisure travel", "text": "Bleisure travel\n\nBleisure travel (UK /ˈbleʒ.əʳ/ US /ˈbliː.ʒɚ/) is a portmanteau of “business” and “leisure”, and, it refers to “the activity of combining business travel with leisure time”.\n\nThe term bleisure was first published in 2009 by the Future Laboratory as part of their biannual Trend Briefing. The term was originally coined by writer and silent revolutionist, Jacob Strand, then a future forecaster working for The Future Laboratory. And co-written by journalist and futurologist Miriam Rayman.\n\nIn corporate business travel, extending a business trip for personal purposes is also known as “bizcation”\n\nThis phenomenon has been studied from 2011, from this year on, a report shows that bleisure travel has been maintaining a constant growth, accounting for 7% of all business trips.\n\nBleisure travellers can be described as “individuals who combine leisure with professional business obligations when abroad”.\n\nThe elements characterising bleisure travellers are some and different, this make difficult to draw a defined profile of these individuals. Bleisure is a widespread practice among US travellers, especially for those working in Technology, Healthcare, Public Administration sectors. A report shows that US traveller add bleisure to nearly half of the cases, precisely 52% for International trips and 42% for domestic ones. The main reasons for travelling would be conferences and conventions, team building, client meetings and presentations.\n\nBleisure travellers could be grouped according to various aspects, in particular gender, age and trip frequency.\n\nA research indicates that female business travellers would be more likely to take bleisure trips than male. In both groups 20% of travellers would take one or more bleisure trips in a year time, however women look to register higher rate: 8.5% against 6.8% of men.\n\nYounger travellers (between 20 and 25) look significantly more likely to add weekends to their business trips, measuring a rate close to 15%. This result is two or three times higher than those for 45-50 age interval. Millennials travellers deserve a special attention because they appear to be the individuals shaping the future of business travel, nearly twice likely to travel for business than Baby Boomers. This could be attributed to their flexible attitude to life, which would lead to the blurring of the line between their private and professional life. Millennials seem to work often from home or during the evening hours, to dedicate leisure on-goings to traditional work hours. A consequence of this freedom could be their willingness to extend business trips including vacation activities. In comparison with other age group, Millennials look to be more likely to take bleisure trips, compared to older travellers. However, it is not clear whether this reflects unique preferences or transitory life events.\n\nFrequent travellers taking 20 trips or more per year seem to be less than 5% likely to take a bleisure trip during the year, they would account for 8% of all bleisure trips. By contrast, one third of all bleisure trips would be taken by employees travelling once a month.\n\nIt seems evident that Millennials workers are increasingly demanding for bleisure from their work trip. Despite the state-of-the-art technology available nowadays, Millennials still prefer face-to-face meetings to get business done, therefore travel is still important for business companies.\n\nBleisure travel looks as a good opportunity to save on travel expenses, mostly for those who do not take a lot of vacation: 66% of US business traveller spend more money on leisure activities because of the money they save on travel. 60% take bleisure trips because do not have a lot of regular vacations. To decide whether to turn a business travel into bleisure or not, employee takes into consideration travelling on exciting destinations, additional costs required to extend the trip, how close the trip is to the weekend, the number of night they must stay for business, how affordable the hotel is, whether they have friends or family in the area, whether they can bring friends or family along. The general trend would indicate the addition of one or two days as the most frequent option, only 23% of bleisure travellers would extend their trips for more than three days. In many cases leisure days equal (37%) or even exceed business days (42%). The length of business trip seems to be a crucial factor when considering extending the trip in 62% of cases. In particular, when business days are more than three, bleisure travellers are not only likely to extend the trip, but also to visit different cities in the area.\n\nFor the employees:\nFor the companies:\n\nThe more likely bleisure destinations are cities offering a combination of different elements, which could allow the travellers to add leisure time to their business trip, such as sightseeing locations, sport venues and cultural events.\n\nThe difference between the origin and the destination city seems to affect bleisure rates: in the case of domestic trips, the amount of bleisure is expected to be low because the two cities should be easily accessible and share similar culture. On the other hand, long intercontinental trips would offer the chance to know realities that are different from ordinary. Researches seem to confirm this trend: bleisure trips would account for 5.2% of the domestic trips and 9.7% of the international ones. The highest bleisure rate (18.4%) appears in international trips when the origin and destination cities are located in different geographical regions.\n\nThe top bleisure cities in US are: Honolulu (above 20%), Miami, Orlando, Las Vegas (12-15%) NYC, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and Fort Lauderdale (9-12%). In Europe rates looks lower, this could be due to the shorter domestic and continental routes: Lisbon, Barcelona, Nice, Istanbul (8-11%), London, Dublin, Amsterdam, Moscow, Rome, Geneva, Paris, Madrid (6-8%).\n\nGiven that bleisure travel is a rising phenomenon, there is still no official regulation, therefore extending business trips for bleisure would have to be decided by management on a case-by-case basis. Some preventive measures could be followed in advance to avoid misunderstanding.\n"}

Legislation (below) made it a criminal offence in 1980. The practice came to symbolise the worst of variously contrived tax strategies from those times.\nIn its 1986/87 annual report, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) stated a total 6,688 companies had been involved, involving revenue of between $500 million and $1 billion.\n\nThe operation at the heart of bottom of the harbour schemes was simple. A company would be stripped of assets and accumulated profits before its tax fell due, leaving it then unable to pay.\nOnce assets were stripped, the company would be sent, metaphorically, to the \"bottom of the harbour\" by being transferred to someone of limited means and with little interest in its past activities. The company's records were often lost too. The ATO, being in the same position as other unsecured creditors in the case of an insolvent company, ended up with nothing.\n\nPromoters such as lawyers or accountants generally facilitated the transactions. The promoter would help the owners of a company first transfer the assets to a new company which was to continue the business, then the owners sold the old company to the promoter for the value of the untaxed accumulated profits, less an amount representing a fee or commission. For the owners this was the sale of a capital asset and hence untaxed (being prior to Capital Gains Tax).\n\nThe promoter would have the company pay (to the promoter) a dividend of the money it had left, then the promoter on-sold the now empty shell to someone else. The way the promoter paid the owners for undistributed profits was similar to a dividend strip operation. In any case the amount the promoter paid was a tax deduction (since the promoter would be in the business of buying and selling shares) and the dividend would be taxable income, leaving just the promoter's commission taxable, not the whole original company profit.\n\nThe \"harbour\" in the expression was usually taken as referring to Sydney Harbour (which is adjacent to the financial district), though obviously the sense is also quite general. The actual origin of the name and the practice is not clear.\n\nThe first time the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) detected a bottom of the harbour scheme was in 1973. Rod Todman, a senior investigations officer in Perth, found a scheme involving about 50 companies and selected one for investigation. By 1974, he had assembled evidence which was referred to the Deputy Crown Solicitor (DCS) in Perth for possible prosecution as a test case.\n\nThe DCS was uncertain of the prospects for the case, but in late 1974 had a Queen's Counsel opinion strongly recommending charges of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth be brought against the promoter and two other individuals. There then followed delay upon delay, duplicated investigations, ill-prepared reports by inexperienced officers, and even a DCS officer deliberately avoiding contact with the ATO.\n\nAfter five full years, in April 1979, and based on miscommunication, the Crown Solicitor in Canberra advised the ATO that the evidence was insufficient and the case was dropped. It might well have been that it was not strong enough, but that decision was not arrived at in a well-considered way. The performance of the various DCS officers was later the subject of scathing criticism, with problems arising primarily from overworked and underskilled staff, and bad management.\n\nThe abandoned case only came to light in 1982 in the Costigan Royal Commission investigating activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Commission came upon bank account transactions for millions of dollars, and the \"paper trail\", as it was called, led eventually, and among other things, to the bottom drawers of the DCS Perth.\n\nOne of those other things the commission found was that the wife of one of the senior case officers at the DCS Perth was running an escort service, and that she was a company secretary at several companies which were involved in bottom of the harbour schemes. There was no suggestion her husband improperly used his position, but the connection was close enough to be extremely embarrassing for all concerned, and the officer was dismissed.\n\nIn 1980, the \"Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980\" put an end to bottom of the harbour schemes. Under the act it became a criminal offence for any person to make a company or trust unable to pay tax debts (income tax, sales tax, etc.), or to aid or abet any person or company doing so. The act thus caught both those in the schemes and the promoters of such schemes. It made it unnecessary to go through the crime of defrauding the Commonwealth that had been so poorly handled at the Deputy Crown Solicitor above.\n\nThis act was controversial at the time, since tax avoidance was (and perhaps still is) regarded as something less than an outright crime. Tax matters might normally be addressed by closing a revenue loophole, the act instead treated bottom of the harbour schemes like frauds.\n\nThe \"Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982\" went further, allowing for the recovery of tax avoided under bottom of the harbour tax schemes between 1 January 1972 and 4 December 1980. The retrospectivity in this act was even more controversial than making the avoidance a crime.\n\nTreasurer John Howard said the normal reluctance against retrospectivity was \"tempered by the competing consideration of overall perceptions as to the equity and fairness of our taxation system and the distribution of the tax burden.\" (House, 23 September 1982). Senator Don Chipp thought the purpose noble but was strongly against retrospectivity, saying \"I do not trust politicians to legislate retrospectively. One of the few protections that the ordinary citizen has is that he knows the law.\" (Senate, 19 November 1982).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1624953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1624953", "title": "Cabotage", "text": "Cabotage\n\nCabotage () is the transport of goods or passengers between two places in the same country by a transport operator from another country. It originally applied to shipping along coastal routes, port to port, but now applies to aviation, railways, and road transport as well.\n\nCabotage rights are the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries do not permit aviation cabotage, and there are strict sanctions against it, for reasons of economic protectionism, national security, or public safety. One notable exception is the European Union, whose Member States all grant cabotage rights to each other.\n\nCabotage originally meant simply coasting trade, from the French \"caboter\", to travel by the coast. Its ultimate origin is uncertain. The air transport meaning is attested in 1933.\n\nCabotage laws apply to merchant ships in most countries that have a coastline so as to protect the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition, preserve domestically owned shipping infrastructure for national security purposes, and ensure safety in congested territorial waters.\n\nFor the history of cabotage in UK law, see Navigation Acts.\n\nIn the United States, the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (Jones Act) requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. The Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 states that no foreign vessels shall transport passengers between ports or places in the United States, either directly or by way of a foreign port.\n\nIndonesia implemented a cabotage policy in 2005 after previously allowing foreign-owned vessels to operate relatively freely within the country.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 1937) which is also known as the Cabotage Law restricts coastwise trade or the transport of passengers and goods within the country, to vessels with Philippine registry which has to secure a coastwise license from the Maritime Industry Authority. After the passage of Foreign Ships Co-Loading Act or the Republic Act No. 10668 in 2015, foreign vessels with cargo intended to be exported out the country may dock in multiple ports in the country before transiting to a foreign port.\n\nIn the EU, rights to cabotage in newly-admitted Member States (in particular, Greece, Spain and Portugal) were restricted; but this introductory provision was abandoned after criticism in the light of the Paros ferry disaster.\n\nThe Hague–Visby Rules, a convention which imposes duties on maritime carriers, apply only to \"carriage of goods by sea between ports in two different states\", and thus do not apply to cabotage shipping. However, section 1(3) of the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 declares that the Rules \"shall have effect ... where the port of shipment is a port in the United Kingdom, whether or not the carriage is between ports in two different States ...\".\n\nCabotage rights remain rare in passenger aviation. The Chicago Convention prohibits member states from granting cabotage on an exclusive basis, which has limited the availability of cabotage as a bargaining chip in bilateral aviation agreement negotiations. Cabotage is not granted under most open skies agreements.\n\nCarriers licensed under EU law are permitted to engage in cabotage in any EU member state, with some limitations. Ryanair, easyJet, Vueling, Wizz Air, and Aer Lingus have bases and operate domestic services outside their home countries.\n\nThe Closer Economic Relations agreement allows Australian air carriers to fly domestically and internationally from New Zealand and vice versa. An Australian carrier, Jetstar (a Qantas subsidiary), flies domestic routes within New Zealand. Air New Zealand offers one international destination from Australia outside New Zealand, flying between Sydney, Australia and Rarotonga of the Cook Islands. Previously, Qantas Jetconnect, Pacific Blue (a Virgin Australia subsidiary) and Ansett New Zealand were Australian-owned airlines based in New Zealand that operated domestic New Zealand services.\n\nAustralia also permits foreign-owned airlines incorporated under Australian law (such as Tiger Airways Australia and the domestic arm of Virgin Australia) to operate on domestic routes, although it prohibits such airlines from operating international routes as Australian flag carriers.\n\nChile has the most liberal cabotage rules in the world, enacted in 1979, which allow foreign airlines to operate domestic flights, conditional upon reciprocal treatment for Chilean carriers in the foreign airline's country. This unusual regime is partly due to Chile's geographical need for air service, and partly to incentivize liberalization in other countries amid the international expansion of its flag carrier LATAM Chile, which now has major operations in many other Latin American countries. Like Australia, Chile allows foreign companies to set up Chilean subsidiaries to offer domestic flights in Chile, regardless of reciprocity.\n\nBefore 1991, Lufthansa was prohibited from flying to West Berlin, so Pan Am, British Airways, and Air France operated the routes between West Germany and West Berlin. For a short time in the late 1980s, Trans World Airlines also flew between then-West Germany and West Berlin. During this time, Pan Am flew to Tegel, in Berlin, from Munich-Riem Airport (now closed) and Frankfurt. Air France flew from Düsseldorf. British Airways flew from Münster-Osnabrück, Hannover, and some other cities.\n\nIn 2003–2004, the United States Department of Transportation authorized Polynesian Airlines to provide temporary cabotage service in American Samoa after the existing US flag carrier ceased operations, one of very few instances where the US has granted cabotage rights in an emergency.\n\nIn October 2007, the United Kingdom granted Singapore carriers the right to fly domestic UK routes as part of an open skies agreement, which also allows British carriers to fly to any city from Singapore.\n\nReciprocal cabotage rights exist by treaty between New Zealand and Brunei and between the People's Republic of China and Albania.\n\nThe \"modified sixth freedom\" refers to the right to carry passengers between two points in country A through a hub in country B; for instance, a Boston-Toronto-Seattle itinerary. Such services are currently considered to constitute cabotage and are not permitted. In 2002, the United States fined Asiana Airlines for selling tickets from the mainland US to Guam and Saipan via Seoul.\n\nCertain airlines operate services within a foreign country without the right to carry local traffic. For instance, Qantas operates service between New York and Los Angeles solely for use by international connecting passengers. Such services are not generally considered to be cabotage.\n\n"}

The parish is under the authority of the Archdiocese of New York, and is the National Shrine Church of San Gennaro. Located on Baxter Street with an additional entrance on Mulberry Street, the Church of the Most Precious Blood is part of Manhattan's Little Italy neighborhood.\n\nThe parish of the Most Precious Blood was established in 1888 as a National Parish to serve the rapidly growing number of Italian immigrants in Lower Manhattan. Building of the church was begun by the Scalabrini Fathers around 1891. The Scalabrini Order built the foundation but ran out of funding. The Franciscans then took over the parish and completed the church building in 1904. \n\nDuring the Feast of San Gennaro, which is held yearly in September, a celebratory Mass is held at the church on the last Saturday of the festival. After the Mass, a statue of San Gennaro is taken from its home within the church on a procession through the streets of Little Italy. Most Precious Blood is home to several vibrant religious societies in addition to the Figli di San Gennaro, including: the Community of Sant Egidio, and the San Angelo Society. Besides the strong Italian tradition, the Vietnamese congregation has also grown in recent years. The Church is home to the Vietnamese Arts and Learning Cultural Center.\n\nThe Saint Rocco of Potenza Society was originally founded in 1889 at the now demolished St. Joachim's Church on Roosevelt Street. It then moved to St. Joseph Church on Monroe Street, but with the merger in 2015 of St. Joseph's with the Church of the Transfiguration on Mott Street, the Society is now based at the Shrine Church of the Most Precious Blood. \n\nDue to manpower shortages, in March 2014, the Franciscans withdrew from Most Precious Blood and it came under diocesan administration. In 2015, the church became part of the parish of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral. \n\nDuring the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, from 8 December 2015, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, to 20 November 2016, the Feast of Christ the King, was one of the sites of the Holy doors.\n\nThe church was designed by William Schickel & Company, who provided an Italian Franciscan style structure. The marble main and side altars are by Borgia Marble Works of New York. The interior is decorated in Neapolitan Baroque style. Donatus Buongiorno created thirty oil painting murals for the walls and ceiling. The building was renovated in 1995 by the Gargiulo Brothers Construction Company of Mount Vernon, to repair damage suffered from water leakage and general disrepair. The Church was re-consecrated by Archbishop John Cardinal O'Connor on February 7, 1997.\n"}

He has worked in Heinkel, Hermética, Malón and Simbiosis.\n\nClaudio Strunz, born in La Tablada, began his career in Heinkel, a band that would be renamed Jeriko. The band's rehearsal room was located in the Belgrano neighbourhood, which was very distant, so he created a new one at his home. El Reloj hired this rehearsal room as well. He created later a new one in Mataderos, which was hired by the thrash metal band Hermética. He played with that band during tests when the drummer Tony Scotto was absent. As a result, when Scotto left the band Strunz was selected as the new drummer. He joined the band in 1991, just in time for the recording of the LP \"Ácido Argentino\", and stayed with the band since then. Hermética received a golden record for the sales of \"Ácido Argentino\", and a second one for the 1994 CD \"Víctimas del Vaciamiento\".\n\nHermética broke up in 1994, in controversial circumstances. Bassist Ricardo Iorio created a new band, Almafuerte, with new musicians. Strunz, guitarist Antonio Romano and singer Claudio O'Connor, the remaining members of the band, created the band Malón with a new bassist, Carlos Kuadrado. The new band had a thrash metal style similar to Hermética. They recorded two studio CDs and one live CD. Strunz made a guest appearance in the song \"Ardiendo en el cielo\" of \"Tierra Violada\", the first CD of Jeriko. He was the producer of the CD, as well as with their second CD, \"Tensiones\".\n\nMalón broke up in 1998, after the departure of O'Connor. Strunz created the grunge band \"Simbiosis\", which had little success. With his previous experience, he created \"Asbury Park\", a complex of rehearsal rooms. He tried to reunite Malón with Romano and Kuadrado; O'Connor refused to join them. The band broke up again, and Strunz claimed the copyright over the name of the band, forbidding it to continue without him. The band reunited again in 2011, this time with all the original members.\n\nWith Hermética\nWith Malón \nWith Simbiosis\n"}

{"id": "47056614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47056614", "title": "Cross-border insolvency", "text": "Cross-border insolvency\n\nCross-border insolvency (sometimes called international insolvency) regulates the treatment of financially distressed debtors where such debtors have assets or creditors in more than one country. Typically, cross-border insolvency is more concerned with the insolvency of companies that operate in more than one country rather than bankruptcy of individuals. Like traditional conflict of laws rules, cross-border insolvency focuses upon three areas: choice of law rules, jurisdiction rules and enforcement of judgment rules. However, in relation to insolvency, the principal focus tends to be the recognition of foreign insolvency officials and their powers.\n\nThere are, broadly, three approaches to the administration of cross-border insolvency:\n\nThe universalist approach remains largely a holistic ideal and, for the most part, countries are divided into those with a purely territorial approach, and those that apply some form of hybrid approach.\n\nHistorically, most legal systems have developed on a territorial basis, and this is as true in relation to bankruptcy laws as other areas. However, from an early stage there have been piecemeal attempts to develop cross-border cooperation in insolvency matters. \n\nBut from a comparatively early stage common law jurisdictions recognised the desirability of ensuring that insolvency officers from different jurisdictions received the necessary support to enable the efficient administration of estates. Under English law one of the earliest recorded cases was \"Solomons v Ross\" (1764) 1 H Bl 131n. In that case a firm in the Netherlands was declared bankrupt and assignees were appointed. An English creditor had brought garnishee proceedings in England to attach certain sums owing to the Dutch firm but Bathurst J held that the bankruptcy had vested all the firm's assets (including debts owed by English debtors) in the Dutch assignees, and the English creditor had to surrender the fruits of the garnishee proceedings and prove in the Dutch bankruptcy. In \"Re African Farms\" 1906 TS 373 an English company with assets in the Transvaal Colony was in winding-up in England, and the Chief Justice of the Transvaal confirmed that the English liquidator would be recognised and that \"recognition which carries with it the active assistance of the court\", and that active assistance could include: \"A declaration, in effect, that the liquidator is entitled to deal with the Transvaal assets in the same way as if they were within the jurisdiction of the English courts, subject only to such conditions as the court may impose for the protection of local creditors, or in recognition of the requirements of our local laws.\" In \"Galbraith v Grimshaw\" [1910] AC 508 Lord Dunedin stated that there should be only one universal process of the distribution of a bankrupt's property and that, where such a process was pending elsewhere, the English courts should not let actions in its jurisdiction interfere with that process.\n\nHowever, the first significant developments in relation to cross-border insolvency regimes which were widely adopted were (1) the UNCITRAL Model Law, and (2) the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000.\n\nTwo current regimes for international insolvencies have been implemented on something wider than a regional basis: the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, and the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000. Both regimes locate the \"centre of main interest\" (or \"COMI\") of the debtor.\n\nThe United Nations Commission on International Trade Law adopted a model law relating to cross-border insolvency on 30 June 1997. At present 46 jurisdictions have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation, including a number of states with both significant economies and large volumes of cross border trade—such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, as well as leading emerging economies such as Mexico and South Africa.\n\nThe basic concept of the Model Law is to establish what the \"main proceedings\" are in relation to any international insolvency. All other proceedings are referred to as the \"non-main proceedings\". The main proceedings are commenced where the debtor has its centre of main interest, or \"COMI\". Non-main proceedings may be commenced in any place where the debtor has a commercial establishment. The Model Law does not require reciprocity between states, but focuses upon (i) ensuring that states give assistance to insolvency officials from other countries in relation to main proceedings and non-main proceedings, and (ii) eliminating preferences for local creditors over international ones.\n\nThe following countries have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation.\n\nThe EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000 was passed on 29 May 2000 and came into effect on 31 May 2002. The EC Regulation, as its name applies, operates between member states of the European Union, and focuses upon creating a framework for the commencement of proceedings and for the automatic recognition and co-operation between the different member states. Unusually for a European regulation, the EC Insolvency Regulation does not seek to harmonise insolvency laws between the different member states.\n\nLike the UNCITRAL Model Law, the EC Regulation also employs the concept of a centre of main interest (or \"COMI\"). The definition of the COMI is left to member states in their implementation of the Regulation, but paragraph (13) of the preamble states: 'The \"centre of main interests\" should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.' If the COMI of an entity is outside of the European Union then the insolvency proceedings are not subject to the Regulation. In relation to companies there is a presumption that the registered office is the COMI of the company, but this presumption can be (and often is) rebutted.\n\nThe EC Regulation does not define insolvency, but it does define insolvency proceedings as \"...collective insolvency proceedings which entail the partial or total divestment of a debtor and the appointment of a liquidator.\" Article 3 divides proceedings into main proceedings and territorial proceedings. Main proceedings are accorded extraterritorial effect throughout the European Union. One of the concerns expressed in relation to the EC Regulation is that (other than a reference to the European Court of Justice) it provides no mechanism for determining which set of proceedings are the main proceedings if two or more jurisdictions claim their proceedings are the main proceedings.\n\nIn any attempt to harmonise or facilitate cross-border administration of insolvent companies, national insolvency regimes can take widely divergent approaches on certain key points:\n\n"}
{"id": "43252497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43252497", "title": "Daniel Lalín", "text": "Daniel Lalín\n\nHéctor Daniel Lalín, generally known as Daniel Lalín, is an Argentine businessman and accountant with close ties to the ruling Kirchner family. He was the president of Racing Club, a professional sports club based in the Avellaneda district of Buenos Aires, from 1995 to 1999, and is a major figure in the Argentine oil business.\n\nBorn around 1950, Lalín was a member of Montonero, the youth wing of the Peronist left. In 1999, as head of Racing, he described himself as still being “ideologically” a member of Montonero, despite all his wealth and success.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, Lalín was Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the National University of Lomas de Zamora. He later served as treasurer of the city of Buenos Aires during the administration of Carlos Grosso (1989–92). During his term as city treasurer, Lalín and his old friend Daniel Peralta, who at the time was the director of Argentina’s central bank and a close friend of Argentinian president Néstor Kirchner, won oil exploration leases from the Kirchner government, despite not having any experience in that field required under Argentine law.\n\nPrior to his election as president of Racing Club, Lalín also pursued a “successful career in real estate and construction.”\n\nLalín was president of Racing Club, also known as Racing Club de Avellaneda or simply as Racing, from 1995 to 1999. The club was the favorite of President Néstor Kirchner. During his years at Racing Club, according to one source, Lalín became part of a social circle that included “Menemistas” Daniel Vila and José Luis Manzano and “‘K’ front men” Cristóbal López and Lázaro Báez.\n\nDuring Lalín’s tenure, Racing Club experienced a financial crisis. Some sources described him as the latest in a series of incompetent and/or corrupt presidents of Racing Club, suggesting that his purchase of several expensive top-level players precipitated the crisis. According to \"Newsweek\", the major factor in Racing Club’s financial decline was the fact that it had, under Lalín, “stopped developing young talent in favor of recruiting high-priced stars – often using peculiar financing.” \"Newsweek\" noted that Lalín himself was Racing’s biggest creditor, having “pumped $2.5 million of his own money into Racing to keep it afloat, sometimes in exchange for rights to players.”\n\nIn 1998, Lalín, a priest, and some 500 fans took part in an elaborate “exorcism” ceremony with the intention of banishing evil spirits from Racing Club. “We are uniting Roman Catholicism with Racingism,” Lalín explained. “It is an act of faith. The same faith displayed by the fans who stoically go to the stadium every Sunday.”\n\nLalín filed for bankruptcy on behalf of Racing Club on July 10, 1998. When he announced the bankruptcy, fans reacted with outrage. Some hurled stones at him, and one person threw a drum at him, causing an injury to his nose. More than 1500 fans “called for his head.” He defended the bankruptcy, calling it “the best way out.” On July 13, 1998, Judge Enrique Gorostegui officially declared Racing bankrupt. On March 4, 1999, the Court of Appeals of La Plata ordered the immediate liquidation of all of Racing’s assets. Racing, it was announced, had “ceased to exist.” On May 5, 1999, Lalín and his executive committee submitted their resignations. At the time Lalín left the club, it had $62 million in debts, 200 judgments against it, and 3 million pesos in liens. After the club went bankrupt, it was bailed out by the Kirchner government.\n\nOn October 6, 1999, prosecutor Manuel Barreiro issued arrest warrants for Lalín and former Racing presidents Osvaldo Otero and Juan De Stéfano in connection with charges of mismanagement. Lalín was taken into custody, and he and De Stéfano spent 14 days in detention in a police station in Lanús. The charges against him were dropped and he was released. In November 2000, De Stéfano claimed on a Fox Sports program that during the time he and Lalín had been in jail together, Lalín had told him that the dismissal of charges against him, Lalín, had “cost him 200 thousand dollars.” De Stéfano described Lalín’s acquittal as an example of the importance of political favors in “the city of Buenos Aires, the palace of corruption.” Otero said of Lalín that high-level “radical leaders” were “doing everything possible to save him.” De Stéfano blamed both Lalín and Otero for the bankruptcy of Racing Club, which he called “a scam, a lie, immoral, and a disgrace.” De Stéfano claimed that “the club is run by scoundrels,” and urged the judge in the case to conduct a serious investigation that would drive “the Mafia” out of Racing management.\n\nLalín himself also declared personal bankruptcy in 1998 following a request by former Racing coach Carlos Babington, to whom he owed $600,000. They had worked out a payment deal but Lalín had reneged on it. Critics claimed that he owed $8 million and accused him of fraudulent management. It was noted that he actually had “nothing to his name” and held all his assets through companies. “Fiscally he doesn’t exist,” an attorney stated.\n\nAfter leaving Racing Club, Lalín entered the oil business and became very successful in a short period.\n\nA 2001 U.S. Senate report stated that Lalín had engaged in player transactions through Mercado Abierto SA and MA – House Exchange, both subsidiaries of the Cayman Islands-based Grupo Mercado Abierto, which was owned by three Lalín associates, Miguel Iribarne, Aldo Ducler, and Hector Scasserra. The Senate report linked Group Mercado Abierto to the Juarez drug cartel and identified it as a vehicle for laundering bribes and drug-trafficking profits. When Lalín filed a lawsuit in 2004 in Uruguay against businessman Adrián Troche, on a matter involving player transactions, only to withdraw the suit shortly thereafter, a Uruguayan news source suggested that he had probably withdrawn it because he realized that he would have had to explain to the Uruguayan judiciary why his payments in the transactions in question had been made through Grupo Mercado Abierto.\n\nAlso in 2004, it was reported that there were “very strong indications” that player transfers and other activities by Lalín were tied up with money laundering in Uruguayan football. In addition, it was reported that funds paid to Lalín as part of several player transactions had not ended up in the club treasury but rather in Mercado Abierto SA and MA – House Rates accounts at the Bank of New York.\n\nOne 2004 report indicated that Lalín had engaged in business operations that enabled him to skirt hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax payments. Another report the same year stated that Lalín had “evaded nearly two million dollars in taxes.”\n\nIn 2006, it was reported that Lalín was “seeking his place in la Argentina K” – in other words, in the business circles surrounding the Kirchners. Through a holding company, Lalín Global Group, he closed a deal in that year with the Chinese firm JHP, which had subsidiaries in Libya and Kazakhstan. One source states that Lalín, via his firm Maxipetrol-Petroleros de Occidente, turned himself into “a local intermediary of the two Chinese corporations JHP International Petroleum Engineering and New Times Energy Corporation” and became “a pivot in the Chinese appropriation of [Argentinian] oil.”\n\nIn association with JHP, Lalín formed Oxipetrol, a multinational oil exploration firm, in April 2006. The plan was for the Argentinian partners to contribute familiarity with the local market, while the Chinese contributed scientific expertise. It was reported in that year that Lalín had other Chinese business contacts, and that he was serving as the regional representative of Shenzhen Our International Technology & Science, a developer of medical technology. One article described him as an “intermediary in the Kircherist ‘strategic association’ with Chinese monopolies.”\n\nAnother 2006 report identified Lalín and his friend José Luis Manzano Menem, a former Interior Minister, as “two of the leading exponents of an unexpected transformation in the energy world” on account of their large investments in oil exploration. Involved with them in these activities, it was reported, were “K businessman” Cristóbal López and Roberto Monti. (“K businessman,” “K politician,” and similar labels are Argentinian shorthand for persons with close connections to the Kirchner regime.) The four men were described as “emerging national oil bourgeoisie.” The same article stated that Lalín and media entrepreneur Daniel Vila had jointly made “inroads into the territory of ‘K governor’ Julio Cobos” (who at the time was governor of Mendoza province), together proffering a successful bid for the firm Aguas de Mendoza and an unsuccessful bid for the energy company Edemsa.\n\nA 2007 article described Oxipetrol as performing successfully. In that same year, South American Hedge Fund LLC, a subsidiary of Arizona-based Delta Mutual, Inc., paid the Kirchner administration $1.7 million for drilling rights to oil fields owned by Oxipetrol. The next year, Lalín’s friend Peralta and Peralta’s wife, Laura, bought a controlling interest in Delta, through which they sold and purchased oil leases. In 2007, Oxipetrol’s oil fields were valued at $2.7 million; two years later, New Times Group Holdings, based in Hong Kong, bought 60 percent of two of the oil fields for $270 million. In November 2012, Peralta and his wife, Laura, were found shot to death in their home in Scottsdale, Arizona. Although the deaths were ruled a murder-suicide, some individuals close to the couple suggested that their death was connected to their oil activities.\n\nIt was reported in 2008 that Lalín was still hoping to regain control of Racing. When he sought re-election to the presidency of the club, he received only about 500 votes, which he considered “a hard blow to his pride.” Lalín said in March 2013 that he was still “very involved in the politics of Racing,” that he talked frequently with “the people at Racing,” and that it was hurtful to him that some people believe he had “stolen” from Racing. In September 2013 he reiterated his desire to resume control of Racing and harshly criticized its current management.\n\n“I had a lot of luck,” Lalín stated in an interview from 2010, referring to a profit of $63 million he had earned the previous year. A 2014 report by \"Bloomberg News\" identified Lalín as one of several Kirchner intimates who had benefited from the illegal awarding of oil leases. Lalín acknowledged that he had obtained the leases through contacts. “Contacts are everything in Peronism,” he said. “Oil experience helps, but the contacts are what matters.”\n\nAs of 2008, Lalín was involved with a personal trainer named Laura.\n"}

His parents were David Dodge and Mary (Stuart) Earl. She was said to have been the daughter of a Scottish nobleman, perhaps connected with the House of Stuart, pretenders to the British throne, although this has never been confirmed. She had previously been married to William Earl who died of yellow fever fighting for the British during an attack on Havana in 1762. During the War of Independence, Mary's two children from this first marriage, William and Jesse Earl, were both killed on active service. Dodge later wrote that \"these events almost destroyed my mother's nervous system.\"\n\nFrom the age of seven to fourteen, except two months of district school in winter, Dodge was working on a farm in Hampton, Connecticut. He was a teacher at the age of nineteen, first in community schools then in private ones. He later began selling dry goods in Hartford, Connecticut. He also managed the first cotton factory built in Connecticut, near the town of Norwich. In the early 19th century he relocated to New York City.\n\nOn June 7, 1798, he married Sarah Cleveland (1780–1862), the daughter of Rev. Aaron Cleveland (1744–1815) and Abiah Hyde (c1750–1788). They had seven children including William E. Dodge and Elizabeth Clementine Stedman. He was also the great-grandfather of Grace Hoadley Dodge. Sarah Cleveland was great-aunt of Grover Cleveland 22nd and 24th President of the United States.\n\nDavid Low Dodge is credited with publishing the first pamphlets in America that expressed the futility of war. \"The Mediator's Kingdom not of this World\", was published in 1809, his second, \"War Inconsistent with the Religion of Jesus Christ\", was completed in 1812, two years before the publication of Noah Worcester's \"Solemn Review of the Custom of War\" - a work that has since overshadowed Dodge's contribution. Dodge considered forming the first peace society in 1812, but the timing was inappropriate due to the war with Great Britain. However, in August 1815 the New York Peace Society was formed with Dodge as the president. This was the first in the world - four months before Noah Worcester formed the Massachusetts Peace Society, and a year before the English Peace society was formed. In 1829 he assisted in organizing the new national society, and presided at its first annual meeting. He was a member of the board of directors, and later a life director, maintaining his connection with the society until his death.\n\nHe died on April 23, 1852 in New York City.\n\nHis great-great-great-grandsons are businesspeople Frederick R.

{"id": "14538847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14538847", "title": "Deferred Acquisition Costs", "text": "Deferred Acquisition Costs\n\nDeferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) is a term commonly used in the insurance business. It describes the practice of deferring the cost of acquiring a new customer over the duration of the insurance contract. Insurance companies face large upfront costs incurred in issuing new business, such as commissions to sales agents, underwriting, bonus interest and other acquisition expenses.\n\nDAC under U.S. GAAP, MSSB (Modified Statutory Solvency Basis) and IAS 39 are all very similar, except that\nIAS 39 only allows direct, incremental costs to be deferred rather than all acquisition costs.\n\nInsurance companies incur large expenses when acquiring new business, but to ensure that they comply with GAAP's matching principle they need to spread out these costs over the period in which revenues are earned.\n\nThe DAC is treated as an asset on the Balance Sheet and amortized over the life of the insurance contract.\n\nAccrual accounting and deferring implies timewise matching(synchronization) of income and expenses: an incurred cost is capitalized and does not become an expense until it is recognized in the financial statements of the company. In an accounting sense, it is the amortization of that cost, and not the original cost itself, that becomes the expense. Hence, certain costs which are incurred to acquire insurance contracts should not be recognized as an expense in the accounting period in which they are incurred but should be capitalized as an asset on the balance sheet and gradually amortized over the lifetime of the insurance contracts. Such costs are called Deferred Acquisition Expenses (DAE) and capitalization of DAE results in setting up of an asset called Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC).\n\nEstablishment of the DAC asset tends to reduce the policy’s first year strain and generally produces a smoother pattern of earnings.\n\nTo meet the capitalization criteria, these expenses must vary with and be primarily related to the acquisition of new business.\n\nExamples of Deferrable Acquisition Expenses:\n\nAll other expenses associated with the new business that do not vary with and are not primarily related to new policies are classified as non-deferrable acquisition expenses.\n\nDeferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) represents the “un-recovered investment” in the policies issued and are therefore capitalized as an intangible asset to match costs with related revenues. Over time the acquisition costs are recognized as an expense that reduces the DAC asset. The process of recognizing the costs in the income statement is known as amortization and refers to the DAC asset being amortized, or reduced over a number of years.\n\nThe amortization requires an amortization basis that determines how much DAC should be turned into an expense in each accounting period. The amortization basis varies by FAS classification:\n\nUnder FAS 60, assumptions are \"locked in\" at policy issue and cannot be changed. However, under FAS 97 and 120, assumptions are based on estimates that require adjusting DAC as needed. In addition, DAC amortization uses estimated gross margins as a basis and an interest rate is applied to the DAC based on investment returns. The rate at which one amortizes the DAC is referred to the k-factor.\n\nA write off of DAC or amortization of DAC may be caused by dynamical unlocking or true up. The replacement of assumptions by experience for the projections of future years is called “dynamical unlocking”. The replacement of assumed values by realized values of the past year is called “true up process”.\n\n\nAlso referred to as KDAC, the K-Factor is basically the percentage of gross profits required to provide for deferred policy acquisition costs. KDAC is:\nDAC amortization rate = [Present value of Deferrable Acquisition Expenses + Accumulated Value of DAC]/[Present value of Estimated Gross Profits(EGPs) + Accumulated value of Actual Gross Profits(AGPs)]\n\nThe K-factor can change from year to year due to:\n\n1) The true-up process (replacement of expected values by realized values, i.e. actual historical gross profits (AGP) replace prior estimates of Gross profits (EGP))\n\n2) The dynamical unlocking (replacement of assumptions by experience for the projections of future years)\n\nThe DAC is recoverable if the k-factor is less than 100%.\n\nIf there is an Unearned Revenue Liability (URL), it may even be recoverable if the K-factor is higher than 100%.\nIf the K-factor is greater than 100% and there is no URL, a portion of the DAC or the total DAC has to be written off immediately, so that the new K-factor is equal 100%.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50745280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50745280", "title": "Food prices", "text": "Food prices\n\nFood prices refer to the (averaged) price level for food in particular countries or regions or on a global scale. The food industry's contribution to the price levels and fluctuations come from the food production process, food marketing and food distribution. Source of uncontrollable price fluctuations are varying crop yield from excess supply to harvest failure and food speculation activities. It is speculated that already the global climate change could be a major factor behind rising food prices. A continuing drought in South Africa may - amongst other factors - have food inflation soar 11% until end of 2016 according to the South African Reserve Bank. To a certain extent, adverse price trends can be counteracted by food politics. When food commodities become too expensive on the world market, food security is in danger especially for developing countries. In keeping with the supply and demand-principle, global prices will on average continue to rise with the growing world population.\n\nSharp dramatic rises in the food inflation as happened during the 2007-08 world food price crisis have been more pronounced in developing countries than in the OECD and North America in particular, however.\n\nConsumer prices in the rich countries are massively influenced by the power of discount stores and constitute only a small part of the entire cost of living. In particular, Western pattern diet constituents like those that are processed by fast food chains are comparatively cheap in the Western hemisphere. Profits rely primarily on quantity (see mass production), less than high-price quality. For some product classes like dairy or meat, overproduction has twisted the price relations in a way utterly unknown in underdeveloped countries (\"butter mountain\"). The situation for poor societies is worsened by certain free trade agreements that allow easier export of food in the \"southern\" direction than vice versa. A striking example can be found in tomato exports from Italy to Ghana by virtue of the Economic Partnership Agreements where the artificially cheap vegetables play a significant role in the destruction of indigenous agriculture and a corresponding further decline in the already ailing economic power.\n\nThe Numbeo database \"allows you to see, share and compare information about food prices worldwide and gives estimation of minimum money needed for food per person per day\".\n\nThe FAO food price index is a measure of the monthly change in international prices of a market basket of food commodities. It consists of the average of five commodity group price indices, weighted with the average export shares of each of the groups for 2002-2004:\n\nThe World Bank releases the quarterly \"Food Price Watch report\" which highlights trends in domestic food prices in low- and middle-income countries, and outlines the (food) policy implications of food price fluctuations.\n\nIn the long term, prices are expected to stabilize. Farmers will grow more grain for both fuel and food and eventually bring prices down. This has already occurred with wheat, with more crops planted in the United States, Canada, and Europe in 2009. However, the Food and Agriculture Organization projects that consumers still have to deal with more expensive food until at least 2018.\n\nIt is rare for the spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once. Food prices rose 4% in the United States in 2007, the highest increase since 1990, and are expected to climb as much again in 2008. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. In China, the price of pork jumped 58% in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. However, new trade policies have made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983.\n\nFood prices are rising, wealthier Asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. Asian nations have contributed at a more rapid growth rate in the past five years to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry. In 2008, this accounted for more than 30% of production with China accounting for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry. The trend is similarly evident in industries such as soft drink and bottled water manufacturing, as well as global cocoa, chocolate, and sugar confectionery manufacturing, forecast to grow by 5.7% and 10.0% respectively during 2008 in response to soaring demand in Chinese and Southeast Asian markets.\n\nRising food prices over recent years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in Bangladesh and Mexico, and the Arab Spring.\n\nIn 2013, Overseas Development Institute researchers showed that rice has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. This was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. More fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser, diesel and labour. Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities. The researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. The research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for Western African farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.\n\n\n"}

He travelled across Spanish South America visiting Chile for the first time in 1797. It was not until 1804 that his name could be inscribed in the history of Chile. The previous year he had enlisted as a surgeon in the British raider “Blackhouse” or “Bacar” who were dedicated to looting and plundering ships and ports in the Spanish colonies in South America. During this trip, Bacar anchored in the bay of Coquimbo and then taken by assault the city which was unguarded. \n\nDuring the sack of the city Jorge Edwards entered the house of Diego de Ossandón to steal, but he found his daughter, Isabel de Ossandón, who he fell in love with immediately. He decided to desert the ship and asking for shelter in the house of Diego Ossandón. Family tradition says that when Edwards did not return to the British ship, they spent three days looking for him through all the houses in the city. Edwards hid for three days, hiding in a barrel of wine from his former shipmates. On the third day Spanish reinforcements arrived, forcing the British to retreat from the city, to continue their raids to the north. Once the Spanish authorities were aware of the presence of Edwards in La Serena, he was arrested and sent to Callao, where he was detained. \n\nOnce released he returned to La Serena in 1805 he was baptized into the Catholic faith.

His distinctly anti-Spanish feelings made him a supporter of the patriot cause during the Chilean Wars of Independence, making donations to build the fleet for the liberation of Peru, commanded by a fellow Brit, Lord Thomas Cochrane. \n\nThe Supreme Director of Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins granted Edwards Chilean citizenship papers in 1818 as a reward for his services to the Independence cause.

Management responsibilities (supervision of one or more bureaux) determine whether or not someone is an executive, not qualifications. This objective approach shows the exact number of first level executives and permits the development of a database with up-to-date information about age, seniority, gender, level and ministry.\nIn each ministry, second level positions are further classified accordingly to the responsibilities attached to their offices position, corresponding to the classification adopted by the ministry.\n\nUntil October 2002, the Senior Civil Service was meant to be an inter-ministerial homogeneous body, managed by a pool known as the \"Ruolo Unico dei Dirigenti\" (Uniform Register). The creation of this structure, under the supervision of the Prime Minister, was the backbone of the reform conducted from 1993 till 2001. It was underpinned by a database of jobs and profiles. This tool allowed the government to publish available positions in real time and to establish a labour market for managers. The new text adopted in 2002 has replaced inter-ministerial management of executives with ministerial management. However, the inter-ministerial database and the labour market for first level executives have been kept.\n\nOther public bodies, at national and local level, have their Senior Civil Services. \nToday senior civil servants are grouped into eight different contractual areas: \n\nCivil servants below executive level have a different contract with separate grading and pay arrangements.\n\nExecutives are normally recruited through competitions. There are two types of competition:\n\n\nThe executive group is increasingly targeting people from the private sector, universities and regional entities, which currently account for 10% of first level executives and 8% of second level. External candidates can only be hired for a fixed term.\n\nThe status of executives has been governed by private law since 1998. A collective bargaining agreement (drafted by ARAN, the agency representing the public employer and the executives' trade union), stipulates the management conditions required in individual contracts. In other words, a senior executive signs two contracts:\n\n\nFixed-term contracts may not exceed three years for first level executives and five years for executives. These contracts set out the remuneration terms. In 2002, the minister was given the job of setting objectives, which must be very precise, reducing the role of the contract. Achievement of the objectives is nevertheless verified every year based on management control and strategic-planning results.\n\nFirst level SEOs must be confirmed by every new government, or they lose their position.\n\nThe pay structure emphasizes workload, merit and work performance (\"pay for performance\"), while it has no regard to seniority and length of service.\n\nPay is based on:\n\nExecutives are subjected to an annual assessment based on achievement of objectives, the adequacy\nof actions implemented in compliance with ministerial directives and the information supplied by the\nmanagement-control and strategic-assessment service. Executives whose contract expires are assessed to\ndetermine whether to keep and/or to promote them.\n\nAssessment disputes are reviewed by an appeal committee.\n\nWhen an executive cannot immediately find a new position on termination of a fixed-term contract, he /she keeps part of his fixed wage (60% of the remuneration).\n\nAn executive's career does not follow a straight line. On completion of a fixed-term contract, he or she can move from a grade C position to a grade A position if assessment results are highly satisfactory. In order to encourage both internal promotion and competition, 40% of the positions of director generals may be filled by second level executives and 10% by non-government personalities.\n\nWhen the \"rotation\" obligation was formally withdrawn in the decree of October 2002 (probably because of shorter contracts), the principle of mobility was preserved. It is supported by an inter-ministerial database with real-time vacancies at every ministry. \nFive-year stints in the private sector and international organisations are also encouraged. These do not affect the executive's career.\n\nContinuing education is covered by a directive from 2001 whose purpose was to galvanise training plans, considered a primary tool for leading change at government services. Today, training must be mentioned in resumes published in the interministerial database. The purpose of this requirement is to give executives a strong incentive to get trained. In order to promote the use of management methodologies and recognition of international concerns in executive actions, executives are now entitled to work for up to five years in the private sector or in international organisations with the right to return to the executive group without loss of prerogatives.\n\nLastly, line managers can become researchers. A plan launched by the Public Administration School allows interested executives to research useful government modernisation themes under research teachers.\n\nIn February 1993, a founding legislative decree introduced contracts for officials who are now employed under general labour laws.\n\n\nWhile the decree of 1993 remains the basis for every senior management reform, three periods can be distinguished, each of which raised contractualisation to a new level:\n\na) 1993 to 1998: the \"privatisation\" recommended in the working note did not yet apply to first level executives. Their appointments and performance obligations remained the minister's responsibility. Their pay reflected standard scales. Other managers were governed by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nb) 1998 to 2002: collective bargaining agreements became applicable to first level executives. They signed fixed-term contracts under private law specifying objectives and pay. The reform created an inter-ministerial management structure. In principle, all executives should have been lumped in this pool, which the ministries could have sourced for needed profiles. In fact, the ministries remained in control, trying to keep their best executives. Mobility was boosted by the development of an inter-ministerial database with the resumes of all first level executives and a list of available positions updated in real time. The years ahead can be expected to lead gradually to the creation of a genuine labour market.\n\nc) Since October 2002: the appointment and objectives of first level executives are fixed by decree (unilateral public act). Their pay is negotiated bilaterally and laid down in a private contract signed for the term of their appointment (3 years or less). The \"ruolo unico dei dirigenti\" has made way for ministerial pools but the inter-ministerial database continues to be used. The objective remains to promote mobility.\n\nThe newly organised \"dirigenza\" became the launch pad for the modernisation of public management. The new management of senior management has made the civil service more politically neutral and, as such, has clarified the respective roles of politics and the civil service. The main purpose of the newly created dirigenza was to remedy the lack of professionalism and the political bias of the hallowed senior public service by fostering a culture of excellence within the government and promoting close relations based on shared principles combining the founding values of the civil service - integrity, neutrality and impartiality - with the more pragmatic qualities demanded from managers. This ethics of accountability remains the cornerstone of all texts adopted since 1993.\n\n\n"}

His house and grounds in Glasgow became Benmore Botanic Garden, managed by Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.\n\nDuncan was born in 1834 in Greenock. He was the son of a second-hand bookseller.\n\nIn the early 1850s, James Duncan was studying chemistry at Glasgow. He had a break and took a boat trip from Greenock to the lochs and coastlines of Argyllshire. While on Loch Long, he conceived a unique method of refining sugar. He patented his idea for sugar refining. Then between 1858 and 1861, he became a partner of the Greenock firm of 'Duncan, Bell & Scott'. In 1854, the refinery was producing up to 50,000 tons.\n\nAfter 1861, he developed a factory in Silvertown, London, at Millbank 21 Mincing Lane, called the 'Clyde Wharf Refinery'. It was the largest and most profitable sugar refinery in London. He was always refining the process and learning different applications to keep his company at the top of the industry. At the peak of the business, they were producing up to 2 thousand tons of sugar a week.\n\nIn 1878 he was elected fellow of the Society of Chemical Industry, later becoming its Vice-President. By 1879 he held the prestigious post of 'Chairman of the Sugar Refiners' Committee', and also became Vice-President of the 'Railway and Canal Traders' Union'.\n\nIn 1884, cheap German sugar arrived in the UK, which was much cheaper than UK produced sugar.\n\nIn August 1885, he published an article in the 'Sugar Cane' journal, titled 'The bounty on exportation of refined sugar from the United States'.\n\nIn 1886, the unfair foreign competition meant that he had to close his London works of Clyde Wharf.\n\nHe returned to Scotland, to manage the smaller refinery business in Greenock. After he retired, he spent time with his sister 'Mary Moubray' in Strone, and then spent the winter months in Italy.\nJames Duncan's charitable work was widely known throughout Britain. he gave 20 per cent of his annual £100,000 salary to a range of causes, making him one of the most committed philanthropists of the time.\n\nHe also built 2 churches for 2 different congregations.\n\nHe was known as a major collector of fine art and was also a lender of pictures to annual exhibitions, including the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. In 1878, he was elected Vice-President of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. He regularly contributed works to European exhibitions, including the most prestigious at the Paris Salon, and to key international exhibitions of art and industry in France and Germany in the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nHe was the first Scottish collector of an Impressionist work including purchasing in 1883, Renoir's painting 'Bay of Naples'.\nThe painting was later lent to the National Gallery of Scotland by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (who now own it), for a summer exhibition about James Duncan's collection. Duncan was also one of the most valued and important clients of the influential French picture dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, and regularly frequented the studios of Europe's most famous painters. He collected works by the likes of Raeburn and Corot, including Eugène Delacroix's masterpiece \"Death of Sardanapalus'.\n\nHe was friends with various people in different fields of work including; the chemist James \"Paraffin\" Young, who established\nthe world's first commercial oil works; the pioneering ophthalmic surgeon 'Dr Neven Gordon Cluckie', whose work led to the establishment of eye surgeries in hospitals throughout\nBritain; the celebrated preacher Charles Spurgeon; Rev. Henry Boyd (Principal of Hertford College Oxford, 1878–1922), with whom Duncan\nhad worked closely in the 1870s to improve working conditions in London's East End; and Gustave Doré, the French artist whose gallery, paintings and book illustrations proved so popular in Britain. \n“Duncan also employed his significant wealth in helping the poor in Scotland and England and improving the working conditions of his workforce, building churches and schools, providing medical care and introducing an eight-hour working day.\" noted Peter Baxter (Benmore House Curator).\n\nDuncan had also been in contact with the eminent botanist Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and with Henry Morton Stanley, the explorer and friend of David Livingstone who visited Duncan some time in the 1870s or 1880s.\n\nIn Kilmun, at Graham's Point there is a memorial to James Duncan. Which was designed by A. Macfarlane Shannon.\n\nIn 1870, James Duncan purchased Benmore House near Dunoon, Argyll. He then set about building a gallery (to showcase his large collection of fine arts. As well as a fernery and one of the largest greenhouses in Scotland.\n\nThe estates amounted up to 12,260 acres of land. He made extensive improvements to the land. On some of which he grazed \"West Highland cattle\" and blackfaced sheep. The sheep were first seen at the Paris International Exhibition of 1878. His flock of sheep gained awards at the annual exhibitions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland.\n\nHe also had over six million trees planted as part of the large landscape alterations he had designed. Including, commissioning features such as the 'Golden Gates'.Which were earlier shown at the Paris International Exhibition.\n\nFollowing the introduction of a German sugar bounty, Duncan had a massive loss of fortune and had to sell the estate in 1889.\n\nIt was acquired by the Young Family and later gifted to Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh It is now the Benmore Botanic Garden.\n\nHis art collection at Benmore was split up and sold, his paintings are now housed in some of world's greatest museums such as the Louvre, the Belvedere in Vienna, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which is home to four of Duncan's pictures.\n\n"}

He is the founder of the travel and leisure company Contiki Tours. The company is now owned by Trafalgar Tours, itself a division of The Travel Corporation\n\nAnderson was born in Wellington, New Zealand in 1938. He is married to Ali (Alison), a passenger who fell ill on one of Contiki's first tours. They have four children.\n\nAnderson's parents divorced when he was five years old; he was raised primarily by his mother although maintained a good relationship with his father, a dentist who emigrated to England when he was a child.\n\nAnderson emigrated to England in 1961, returning to New Zealand in 1979 with a wife and family. He lived in Auckland for many years and currently lives in Blenheim, Marlborough.\n\nIn the 2012 New Year Honours, Anderson was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to tourism.\n\nIn 1960 Anderson travelled to London, England where his father was living. Anderson planned his route to England to include many stopovers en route. As the president of his local Jaycees association, Anderson contacted fellow presidents in the cities that he planned and received many offers to host him. In this way, Anderson was able to defray his travel costs considerably.\n\nIn his book \"Only Two Seats Left\" Anderson describes his travels with a mixture of awe and sense of adventure. This was Anderson's first travel outside of New Zealand which at that time had a population of just over 2 million.\n\nArriving in England in 1962, Anderson set about planning a trip to see Europe however had only £25 to his name Anderson came up with the idea of advertising for 11 other young Australasians to join him on the trip. He worked out the total costs for the trip and then divided by 11, thus providing a free seat for himself.\n\nThe trip sold quickly, assisted by Anderson meeting prospective fellow travellers and exaggerating his experience of Europe. In fact, his only previous experience of Europe was an overnight trip to Paris. Shortly after having sold all the seats, Anderson was approached by two more prospective passengers. Anderson decided to take advantage of the interest and advertise a second tour to operate following the first. This second tour also sold well and sold out before the first tour departed.\n\nDespite Anderson's inexperience the tour was a success. Anderson admitted his lack of European knowledge to his customers on the first day. After that, he and the eleven others shared duties and decision making, including driving duties in the 12 seater Commer van they christened \"Tiki\" after the Maori good luck charm\n\nFor the second tour Anderson had increased the price from £100 to £115 per person. Despite this, upon arrival in Monaco Anderson found he had nearly run out of money and would be unable to complete the advertised itinerary. Anderson worked out the amount of money that he would need to express the group directly back to England and took the remaining funds to a casino where he gambled on the roulette tables. He won and was able to continue the tour without his customers finding out.\n\nThe trips which had begun as an exercise to fund his own travels around Europe became a fast-growing business; fleet and staff grew rapidly and a number of new tours were developed under the name \"Tiki Tours\", in recognition of the company's first vehicle.\n\nWhen the New Zealand Tourist Board challenged Anderson over his use of the name \"Tiki Tours\" he changed the company's name to \"Contiki\", the \"con\" coming from The \"Con\"tinent.\n\nContiki grew to include tours worldwide. During the 1980s the company began to diversify from its roots as a tour company for 18- to 35-year-olds (originally 19 to 29). Examples included building hotel resorts in Queenstown and in the Great Barrier Reef, and the purchase of Fullers Ferries.\n\nBy the mid 1980s Contiki was a global organisation headquartered in Hong Kong. Anderson was living in New Zealand and travelled frequently for directors meetings and to review the company's operations.\n\nIn the early 1980s Anderson sold down his investment in Contiki, allowing fellow directors to invest as shareholders. In 1985 Omnicorp, a company controlled by Lloyd Morrison purchased a 50% stake in the business.\n\nThe stock market crash of 1987 devalued many of Contiki's assets. This, along with the poor performance of recent acquisitions, notably Fullers Ferries, placed Anderson in financial difficulty. In 1989 he was forced to sell his remaining shares in Contiki as well as his family home to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nDuring the early 1990s Anderson was employed to sell off the assets of former Contiki empire. His wife Ali returned to full-time work to supplement their income. They briefly owned and ran a chain of stores in Auckland selling packaged sandwiches. The business was short-lived and they moved to Blenheim in the late 1990s. Along with Contours Travel, John has started tours to South America for 'baby boomers'.\n\nIn recent years Anderson has taken up public speaking as a profession and has presented his Contiki story to many businesses.\n\nIn 2010 Anderson published \"Only Two Seats Left\", an autobiography that focuses mainly on his time with Contiki from 1961 to 1989.\n\n"}

By Law, these decisions will not be biased by age, race, national origin, organizational affiliation, seniority, color, creed and sex. The term \"Merit Shop\" was coined by John Trimmer, who served from 1952 to 1976 as an officer of the Associated Builders and Contractors, an American trade association consisting primarily of non-union construction contractors. In common usage, \"merit shop\" is often synonymous with being non-union or open shop.\n\nThere are many other organizations that represent merit shop companies. For example, the Independent Electrical Contractors represents almost 3,000 open shop electrical and systems contractors in the USA, while also offering apprentice training, as recognized by the Department of Labor. Founded in 1957, the organization represents its member companies' small business and merit shop interests at the national, state, and local levels of government. \n\nOther merit shop-oriented associations include the Association of Merit Shop Craftsmen and the Merit Shop Roundtable. \nA definition provided in \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law\" (1996) defines \"merit shop\" as a noun meaning “open shop.”\n\n"}

He was the first athlete from his country to win a gold medal at what is now known as the Commonwealth Games, when he won the 100 yards final in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on 31 July 1954.\n\nMichael Agostini was born on 23 January 1935 at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. His family had interests in sports: his father played football, his mother played hockey, and all his siblings participated in football and athletics events at St. Mary's College, where they studied.\n\nAgostini participated in athletics, football, and boxing in his school days. In 1952, at Kingston, he defeated Jamaican sprinter Herb McKenley, who had won one gold and two silver medals at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. On a scholarship, Agostini enrolled at Villanova University, where he received training from Jumbo Elliott. On 23 January 1954, his 19th birthday, he set a world indoor record for over 100 yards at Washington, beating Olympic champion Lindy Remigino. The same year, he competed in the 1954 Commonwealth Games at Vancouver, Canada, and won gold in the 100 yards race (9.6). He defeated Canadian Don McFarlane (9.7) and Australian Hec Hogan (9.7), becoming the first athlete from Trinidad and Tobago to win gold at the Commonwealth Games. Hogan was then in the news for tying the world records of 100 yards (9.3) and 100 m (10.2) and was the most anticipated winner. Reports suggest that Hogan's performance was hampered after he was informed that Agostini had ironically stated in a pre-Games interview, \"Who the heck is Hogan?\" when questioned about him.\n\nIn 1955 Agostini participated in the Pan American Games held in Mexico and won a silver and a bronze in the 100 m and 200 m races, respectively. He also won silver at the 1959 Chicago Pan American Games in the 100 m, a bronze in the 200 m, and another bronze in the 4 × 100 m relay.\n\nIn the next Commonwealth Games at Cardiff in 1958, he stood third in the 100 yards run behind Keith Gardner of Jamaica and Tom Robinson of Bahamas. Agostini won another gold in the 1959 British West Indies Championships in the 100 m and a bronze in the 200 m.\n\nAgostini had also represented Trinidad and Tobago at the Men's 100 m and Men's 200 m at the 1956 Summer Olympics, ranking 6th and 4th, respectively.\n\nAgostini retired from active sports in the late 1950s. He graduated with a degree in economics from Fresno State University, California, in 1958. In the late 1950s Agostini moved to Australia and married Pamela, with whom he had two daughters and two sons. He received Australian citizenship in 1961. He coached various sprinters, including Ralph Doubell, Andrew Ratcliffe, Peter Vassella, and Jenny Lamy. He worked as a freelance journalist and as a teacher for a brief time, and also served as editor and publisher for \"Track and Field\" magazine in the mid-1960s.

Being a college undergraduate, he started off as a financial analyst at Cherkizovsky, a major Russian meat processing plant, which was subsequently reorganized into a JSC Group Cherkizovo, Russia’s largest producer of meat products.\n\nIn 2000, Babaev took over as a head of the poultry production business unit in the company’s agro-industrial complex and was managing it until 2005, when, due to the merger of the company’s agro-industrial and meat processing units, a larger facility was formed, namely CHERKIZOVO Group; Naum was appointed the company’s Strategy and Development Director.\n\nAccording to Vedomosti, the prominent Russian business daily, his achievements at the position were fully recognized with CHERKIZOVO’s IPO launch in 2006.\n\nAt the beginning of 2007, Babaev resigned to proceed on his own. Cherkizovo’s official statement marked his contribution to the Group.\n\nRusmolco was established in October 2007, when Babaev started two mega dairy farms, from the ground up in Penza Oblast about 700 km south-east of Moscow. By 2011 Rusmolco had become a major regional raw milk producer, doubling the average milk productivity in Russia at 9270 kg per cow against the average 4500 kg, according to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation.\n\n\"Babayev has thrived on importing foreign best practices to Russian farms\", said \"The Moscow Times\".\n\nAt the beginning of 2012, Rusmolco embarked on a strategic cooperation with a Singapore company Olam International, a leading agri-business, operating in 70 countries. OLAM invested $75 million in the deal, thereby attaining 75% of Rusmolco assets. The partners announced their intention to form a large-scale dairy enterprise with $400 million investment capital (the initial 20-thousand milking herd was meant to reach up to 50 thousand heads in the short run). Thus, Russia’s agriculture secured a hefty chunk of investment, labeled in the mass media as being \"unprecedented\".\n\nIn 2012, by a year-end estimation of the Institute for the Agricultural Market Studies, Rusmolco secured the fourth place among the five largest raw milk producers in the Russian Federation.\n\nIn 2011, shortly after the Olam International deal, Babaev undertook the effort to consolidate the leftover assets (namely, the turkey production plant, the PENZENSKY dairy complex as well as a veal-and-milk production facility in Penza and Tyumen regions, and 25K hectares of agricultural land. The effort had been a success, resulting in the launch of the agro-industrial holding company Damaté Group.\n\nThe Group’s priority was turkey meat production. At the time, turkey was not popular with the Russians; the average consumption per capita wobbled at 0, 8-1,0 kg, with the overall production hardly totaling 120-150 thousand tons per year.\n\nBy the end of 2016, Damaté became the largest turkey producing company in Russia. According to the Agrifood Strategies data, in 2016, the company produced 60,800 tons of turkey in carcass weight. The Damaté leadership had also been confirmed by Rosptitsesoyuz, the Russian Union of Poultry Producers.\n\nAccording to Vedomosti, \"In the 10 years' span, the entrepreneur Naum Babaev made a profound career leap, from the top-manager of a major agro-holding to the owner of the largest turkey producer in Russia\".\n\nAt the end of 2016, Damaté had been ranked among the top-25 largest meat producers in this country.\n\nIn 2012, Babaev acquired the dairy product plant Penzensky (MOLCOM), the largest processor of milk in Penza region with a cheese factory in Belinsky town.\n\nAt the end of 2013, Damaté, in partnership with food group Danone, launched a high-powered production of the premium quality milk in Tyumen region, Western Siberia. At the beginning of 2017, Tyumen delivered its first tons of milk to Danone production facilities\n\nBabaev owns Damaté on a par with the holding’s CEO Rashid Khairov. They had met in 1998, long before the Damaté endeavor. According to Vedomosti, in their current partnership, Babaev is implementing the strategic management of the firm, while Khairov is being responsible for the day-to-day management.\n\nNaum Babaev is married to Anna, a photographer; the family is raising three children, Alexander (2006), Mikhail (2009), and Elizaveta (2013).\n"}

The airline launched its first international flights in 1998, the same year that Levy became Air Tahiti Nui's first CEO. Levy helped to guide the international expansion of the airline while CEO and earned a reputation for his managerial efficiency. As CEO of Air Tahiti Nui, Levy was nominated in 2002 by Travel Agent Magazine for \"Manager of the Year\" in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nLevy was very well connected in the tourism industry, as well as in French Polynesian politics. Levy was a prominent supporter of the Tahoeraa Huiraatira Party, a pro-French political party which opposes independence for French Polynesia from France. He was replaced as CEO of the airline when the coalition of pro-independence parties led by Oscar Temaru took power in a surprise election victory. However, Levy returned to the board of directors of Air Tahiti Nui following the 2005 presidential election win of French Polynesian President Gaston Tong Sang, a pro-French candidate from the Tahoeraa Huiraatira Party. Sang asked Levy back to help revive the ailing airline, which was suffering from \"recurrent\" financial shortfalls and problems. (The Government of French Polynesia is a 61.7% shareholder in the airline.)\n\nAdditionally, Levy also served as head of the local French Polynesian post and telecommunications company, OPT.\n\nLevy's last tourism venture was the June 1, 2007, launch of easyTahiti.com , a specialist travel web site for Tahiti and other French Polynesian islands. EasyTahiti.com has been described as \"Tahiti's biggest virtual travel agency\" in a press release from Air Tahiti Nui.\n\nNelson Levy died unexpectedly of a heart attack on June 3, 2007, at his home in Tahiti, just two days after the official launch of easyTahiti.com. Levy had hosted barbecue for employees of easyTahiti.com at his home just hours before his death. His funeral took place in Papeete, Tahiti on June 6, 2007.

In some legal systems, preferential creditors take priority over all other creditors, including creditors holding security, but more commonly, the preferential creditors are only given priority over unsecured creditors. Some legal systems operate a hybrid approach; in the United Kingdom preferential creditors have priority over secured creditors whose security is in the nature of a floating charge, but creditors with fixed security take ahead of the preferential creditors generally.\n\nIn English law the concept was first introduced for personal bankruptcy in 1825 pursuant to the Bankrupts (England) Act 1825, and for companies in 1888 pursuant to the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Act 1888. Prior to that, all unsecured creditors ranked equally and without preference (\"pari passu\") in a series of statutes stretching back to the Statute of Bankrupts 1542.\n\nCreditors who are characteristically preferred creditors are:\n\nIn the United Kingdom, employees’ holiday pay/wages are classed as preferential – if they are paid via redundancy payments fund then the Department of Employment becomes a secured creditor. If there is a shortfall, in those cases where someone earns in excess of the government limit, then they can claim preferentially too. The right of the Crown as a preferential creditor was removed by the Enterprise Act 2002.\n\nCreditors, and sometimes individual assets, are also placed in classes by specific laws for specific events, such as a deposit insurance scheme triggered by a bank failure. For example, Switzerland's deposit protection has Class I (first-class), Class II (second-class) and Class III (third-class) unsecured creditors.\nfollowing are the preferential creditors:- \n1.all revenues, taxes, cesses and rates, whether payable to the Government or local authority, due to payment by the company with in 12 months before the date of commencement of winding up.\n\nIn admiralty law, many legal systems accord certain claims preferential status where a ship is subject to arrest.

{"id": "743972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=743972", "title": "Space law", "text": "Space law\n\nSpace law encompasses national and international law governing activities in outer space. International lawyers have been unable to agree on a uniform definition of the term \"outer space\", although most lawyers agree that outer space generally begins at the lowest altitude above sea level at which objects can orbit the Earth, approximately .\n\nThe inception of the field of space law began with the launch of the world's first artificial satellite by the Soviet Union in October 1957. Named \"Sputnik 1\", the satellite was launched as part of the International Geophysical Year. Since that time, space law has evolved and assumed more importance as mankind has increasingly come to use and rely on space-based resources.\n\nAt Caltech in 1942 Theodore von Kármán and other rocket scientists banded together to form Aerojet rocket company with the help of lawyer Andrew G. Haley. To toast the new corporation, Kármán said, \"Now, Andy, we will make the rockets – you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on you will have to see that we behave well in outer space...After all, we are the scientists but you are the lawyer, and you must tell us how to behave ourselves according to law and to safeguard our innocence.\" Indeed, twenty years later Haley published the fundamental textbook, \"Space Law and Government\".\n\nBeginning in 1957 with the Space Race, nations began discussing systems to ensure the peaceful use of outer space. Bilateral discussions between the United States and USSR in 1958 resulted in the presentation of issues to the UN for debate. In 1959, the UN created the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). COPUOS in turn created two subcommittees, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and the Legal Subcommittee. The COPUOS Legal Subcommittee has been a primary forum for discussion and negotiation of international agreements relating to outer space.\n\nIn 1960 the International Astronautical Congress met in Stockholm and heard several submissions including a survey of legal opinion on extraterrestrial jurisdiction by Andrew G. Haley.\n\nIn 1963 Yale University Press published \"Law and Public Order in Space\" by Myres McDougal, Harold Lasswell and Ivan Vlasic.\n\nFive international treaties have been negotiated and drafted in the COPUOS :\n\n\nThe outer space treaty is the most widely adopted treaty, with 104 parties. The rescue agreement, the liability convention and the registration convention all elaborate on provisions of the outer space treaty. UN delegates apparently intended that the moon treaty serve as a new comprehensive treaty which would supersede or supplement the outer space treaty, most notably by elaborating upon the outer space treaty's provisions regarding resource appropriation and prohibition of territorial sovereignty. The moon treaty has only 17 parties however, and many consider it to be a failed treaty due to its limited acceptance. India is the only nation that has both signed the moon treaty and declared itself interested in going to the moon. India has not ratified the treaty; an analysis of India's treaty law is required to understand how this affects India legally.\n\nIn addition, the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and Under Water (\"Partial Test Ban Treaty\") banned the testing of nuclear weapons in outer space.\n\nThe five treaties and agreements of international space law cover \"non-appropriation of outer space by any one country, arms control, the freedom of exploration, liability for damage caused by space objects, the safety and rescue of spacecraft and astronauts, the prevention of harmful interference with space activities and the environment, the notification and registration of space activities, scientific investigation and the exploitation of natural resources in outer space and the settlement of disputes.\" \n\nThe United Nations General Assembly adopted five declarations and legal principles which encourage exercising the international laws, as well as unified communication between countries. The five declarations and principles are:\n\nThe United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical and Legal Subcommittees operate on the basis of consensus, \"i.e.\" all delegations from member States must agree on any matter, be it treaty language before it can be included in the final version of a treaty or new items on Committee/Subcommittee's agendas. One reason that the U.N. space treaties lack definitions and are unclear in other respects, is that it is easier to achieve consensus when language and terms are vague. In recent years, the Legal Subcommittee has been unable to achieve consensus on discussion of a new comprehensive space agreement (the idea of which, though, was proposed just by a few member States). It is also unlikely that the Subcommittee will be able to agree to amend the Outer Space Treaty in the foreseeable future. Many space faring nations seem to believe that discussing a new space agreement or amendment of the Outer Space Treaty would be futile and time-consuming, because entrenched differences regarding resource appropriation, property rights and other issues relating to commercial activity make consensus unlikely.\n\nIn addition to the international treaties that have been negotiated at the United Nations, the nations participating in the International Space Station have entered into the 1998 Agreement among the governments of Canada, Member States of the European Space Agency, Japan, Russian Federation, and the United States concerning cooperation on the Civil International Space Station. This agreement provides, among other things, that NASA is the lead agency in coordinating the member states' contributions to and activities on the space station, and that each nation has jurisdiction over its own module(s). The agreement also provides for protection of intellectual property and procedures for criminal prosecution. This agreement may very well serve as a model for future agreements regarding international cooperation in facilities on the Moon and Mars, where the first off-world colonies and scientific/industrial bases are likely to be established.\n\nSpace law also encompasses national laws, and many countries have passed national space legislation in recent years. The Outer Space Treaty gives responsibility for regulating space activities, including both government and private sector, to the individual countries where the activity is taking place. If a national of, or an organization incorporated in one country launches a spacecraft in a different country, interpretations differ as to whether the home country or the launching country has jurisdiction.\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty also incorporates the UN Charter by reference, and requires parties to ensure that activities are conducted in accordance with other forms of international law such as customary international law (the custom and practice of states).\n\nThe advent of commercial activities like space mining, space tourism, private exploration, and the development of many commercial spaceports, is leading many countries to consider how to regulate private space activities. The challenge is to regulate these activities in a manner that does not hinder or preclude investment, while still ensuring that commercial activities comply with international law. The developing nations are concerned that the spacefaring nations will monopolize space resources. Royalties paid to developing countries is one reason the United States has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and why some oppose applying the same principles to outer space.\n\nSeveral nations have recently updated their statutory space law, among them Luxembourg in 2017, \nthe United States in 2015, \nand Japan, with the \"Basic Space Law\" in 2008.\n\nSatellites in geostationary orbit must all occupy a single ring above the equator, approximately 35,800 km into space. The requirement to space these satellites apart means that there is a limited number of orbital \"slots\" available, thus only a limited number of satellites can be placed in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries at the same longitude but differing latitudes). These disputes are addressed through the ITU allocation mechanism. Countries located at the Earth's equator have also asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory, notably in 1976, when many countries located at the Earth's equator created the Bogota Declaration, in which they asserted their legal claim to control the use of space above their territory.\n\nWhile this field of the law is still in its infancy, it is in an era of rapid change and development. Arguably the resources of space are infinite. If commercial space transportation becomes widely available, with substantially lower launch costs, then all countries will be able to directly reap the benefits of space resources. In that situation, it seems likely that consensus will be much easier to achieve with respect to commercial development and human settlement of outer space. High costs are not the only factor preventing the economic exploitation of space: it is argued that space should be considered as a pristine environment worthy of protection and conservation, and that the legal regime for space should further protect it from being used as a resource for Earth's needs. Debate is also focused on whether space should continue to be legally defined as part of the “common heritage of man,” and therefore unavailable for national claims, or whether its legal definition should be changed to allow private property in space.\n\nAs of 2013, NASA's plans to capture an asteroid by 2021 has raised questions about how space law would be applied in practice.\n\nIn 2016, the nation of Luxembourg has set out a formal legal framework which ensures that private companies engaged in mining resources in space have rights to those resources.\n\nMichael Dodge, of Long Beach, Mississippi, was the first law school graduate to receive a space law certificate in the United States. Dodge graduated from the National Center for Remote Sensing, Air and Space Law at the University of Mississippi School of Law in 2008. He is now an assistant professor in the Department of Space Studies at the University of North Dakota.\n\nThe University of Mississippi School of Law continues to be the only law school in the United States to offer a Master of Laws (LL.M.) Program in Air and Space Law.<ref>\n"}

Infringement may occur when one party, the \"infringer\", uses a trademark which is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services which the registration covers. An owner of a trademark may commence civil legal proceedings against a party which infringes its registered trademark. In the United States, the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 criminalized the intentional trade in counterfeit goods and services.\n\nIf the respective marks and products or services are entirely dissimilar, trademark infringement may still be established if the registered mark is well known pursuant to the Paris Convention. In the United States, a cause of action for use of a mark for such dissimilar services is called trademark dilution.\n\nIn some jurisdictions a party other than the owner (e.g., a licensee) may be able to pursue trademark infringement proceedings against an infringer if the owner fails to do so.\n\nCourts consider various factors in order to determine whether a trademark was infringed.\nThis last factor, consumer confusion, is the main topic of debate in most cases. \n\nWhere the respective marks or products or services are not identical, similarity will generally be assessed by reference to whether there is a likelihood of confusion that consumers will believe the products or services originated from the trademark owner.\n\nLikelihood of confusion is not necessarily measured by actual consumer confusion if two products do not directly compete against each other but are in proximate markets. Then, to determine consumer confusion, a court may apply one of various factor tests. The primary test comes from Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and is found in \"AMF, Inc v. Sleekcraft Boats\", 599 F.2d 341 (C.A.9) 1979. The Court there announced eight specific elements to measure likelihood of confusion:\n\nOther Courts have fashioned their own tests for likelihood of confusion—like those announced in \"In re E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co\"., 476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (CCPA 1973)\",\" known collectively as the \"DuPont\" factors.\n\nThe party accused of infringement may be able to defeat infringement proceedings if it can establish a valid \"exception\" (e.g., comparative advertising) or \"defence\" (e.g., laches) to infringement, or attack and cancel the underlying registration (e.g., for non-use) upon which the proceedings are based. Other defenses include genericness, functionality, abandonment, or fair use. \n\nThe ACTA trade agreement, signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to actively police for infringement.\n\nIn many countries (but not in countries like the United States, which recognizes common law trademark rights), a trademark which is \"not\" registered cannot be \"infringed\" as such, and the trademark owner cannot bring infringement proceedings. Instead, the owner may be able to commence proceedings under the common law for passing off or misrepresentation, or under legislation which prohibits unfair business practices. In some jurisdictions, infringement of trade dress may also be actionable.\n\n\n\n"}

On 6 April 2006 he was arrested as a suspected accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering. After a decision by European Court of Human Rights, he was released on a bond on 12 January 2009, dying from complications of AIDS on 2 October 2011.\n\nVasily Aleksanyan graduated from the Moscow State University and the Law School of Harvard University as a Master of Laws. In 1992 through 1994 he worked for the USA law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. In 1995–1996 he was the head of the legal department for the British Investment firm SUN Group. Since 1996 he worked as the head of the legal department for Yukos.\n\nOn 1 April 2006, amidst the legal troubles over Yukos company, his position was elevated to that of Executive Vice President. His new position was accepted by the shareholders on 4 April. His main stated goal in the new role was to streamline the corporate governance, achieving direct control over the assets of the company from the London Yukos headquarters bypassing the Moscow based offices of Yukos RM and Yukos EP. The decision was quite important for the struggling company as the Moscow-based offices bluntly refused all the supervision from London obeying orders of the government-controlled Rosneft instead. According to Aleksanyan, the lost control over the Moscow offices led to financial irregularities, including e.g. surfacing of counterfeit 10 billion ruble promissory note.\n\nOn 6 April 2006 Aleksanyan was taken into custody as a suspected accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering by Yukos. According to prosecutors, Aleksanyan was an accomplice to the embezzlement of more than 12 billion rubles. The arrest was based on the testimonies of Svetlana Bakhmina, a subordinate of Aleksanyan arrested in 2004. According to Aleksanyan, Bakhmina's testimonies were false, and were taken from her under pressure.\n\nAfter his arrest Aleksanyan started a hunger strike, insisting that his arrest without court hearings was illegal. He aborted his strike on 27 April 2006.\n\nDuring Aleksanyan's imprisonment, his health rapidly deteriorated due to HIV-related illnesses. He became almost blind and developed cancer of the liver with metastasis into the lymph nodes. He also became ill with tuberculosis.\n\nDespite the grave medical situation demanding urgent antiretroviral treatment and chemotherapy in a hospital, he was denied both. The prosecutors also ignored three injunctions by the European Court of Human Rights on 27 November 2007, on 6 December 2007 and on 20 December 2007. According to Aleksanyan, the prosecutors are demanding false evidence against other Yukos executives from him before starting his medical treatment. On 26 December Aleksanyan made public a statement asking for help from human rights advocates.\n\nEleven days into a hunger strike in his favour by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Aleksanyan was transferred from a pre-trial prison to an oncological hospital on 8 February 2008. On 20 October 2008 Simonovsky Court of Moscow approved continuing pre-trial detention of Alexanyan despite his grave illnesses (he had cancer, tuberculosis and AIDS and his spleen was surgically removed).\n\nOn 8 December 2008 Moscow City Court reversed the decision of Simonovsky Court and decided to release Alexanyan under a bond of 50 million rubles (approximately $2 million). He was to be released after the money was paid. Human rights advocates Lev Ponomaryov and Lyudmila Alexeyeva welcomed the court decision but expressed concern whether Alexanyan would be able to pay this sum of money.\n\nOn 22 December 2008 European Court of Human Rights made its decision over the \"Aleksanyan v. Russia\" case. The court found Russia in violation of four articles of European Convention on Human Rights and obliged Russia to release Alexanyan immediately without any bond.\n\nOn 12 January 2009, after a bond of 50 million rubles was paid, Aleksanyan was released. But he was repeatedly summoned to attend court hearings, where he wore a face mask and could barely stand up during the proceedings. The case against him was only dropped last year as the statute of limitations ran out.\n\nAleksanyan died at his home in Moscow on 2 October 2011, due to complications from AIDS.\n\n"}

While marketing research employs techniques like focus groups, surveys and observation to better understand consumer decision-making, virtual store research uses these standard research techniques within a simulated store setting, delivered via computer. Virtual store research uses 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional computer simulation technology to create retail contexts that are as close to the real shopping experience as possible. This allows test consumers within the virtual environment to interact with store merchandise and make purchase decisions in a way that closely resembles real in-store behavior.\n\nAdditionally, virtual store technology can help consumer packaged goods companies and retailers make daily business decisions without the need for physically changing stores and products.\n\nPrior to the emergence of virtual store technology, the only way to get in-store behavioral data was through in-person store research. In-person store research is the acknowledged gold standard for testing the impact of changes in price, planograms, product packaging, or new products on consumer behavior. A controlled store test requires a change to be made in one set of stores but not in another similar set of stores. The sales results are then compared to determine if the change was beneficial. This approach is often paired with intercept research, which requires the researcher to station data collectors in actual stores and interrupt shoppers to ask questions about their shopping experience. These types of tests take place at the time of purchase and are widely considered to yield the most accurate insights about actual consumer behavior. However, they are very expensive and time consuming, and the tests themselves are considered by many shoppers and storeowners to be highly intrusive.\n\nVirtual store research emerged as a more cost-effective alternative that could address the drawbacks of in-person store research through controlled simulations.\n\nMethodologies for simulating a shelf set in a virtual environment first emerged in the 1990s, led by academic research labs like Harvard Business School’s Marketing Simulation Lab. In 1996, Harvard Business Review published a seminal article by Professor Raymond R. Burke called “Virtual Shopping: Breakthrough in Marketing Research,” which established empirically that “laboratory data can accurately predict the brand market share and consumer price sensitivity observed in the supermarket. Those predictions were most accurate when the simulation reproduced the visual cues that consumers used to make their purchase decisions.” His data indicated that virtual store sales correlate closely with sales in actual stores (correlation scores ranged from 0.90 for beauty categories to 0.94 for cleaning products in one test).\n\nHowever, Burke was a decade early with his article. In a 2008 survey of researchers, only 3.7% of respondents reported using virtual testing techniques. The reason for the slow initial adoption of virtual store research is that these tests were still performed in remote labs, requiring consumers to come to specific locations. Early adopter Kimberly-Clark was featured on the front page of The Wall Street Journal in 2007 for its use of virtual store technology in marketing research, but mainstream market penetration remained low.\n\nFor solution vendors virtual store technologies tend to fall into one of two categories:\n\n\nIn 2002, NORM Research & Consulting, a shopper insight agency founded in Sweden, began the development of Simstore. Simstore is a technological platform and methodology for conducting virtual store research. It was developed in partnership with Arla Foods and the Stockholm School of Economics. NORM was one of the first agencies to offer a unique browser-based solution that enables the FMCG industry to easily test multiple scenarios by measuring actual shopping behaviour, using online panellists. Simstore started as an online 2D research tool and, in 2011, NORM added Simstore 3D solutions to the offer. NORM continues to challenge the market with new and innovative ways to conduct virtual store research and helps clients worldwide to get a better understanding of the complexity of shopper decision-making.\n\nAt the end of 2005, ACTIPLAY, a technology company based in France, with a history in Advergames, developed ACTISKU, one of the first online solutions to enable brands and research companies to test out new marketing concepts in a 3D virtual context using online panelists. Originally created for the Carlsberg group, the technical challenge was and remains, being able to keep the download times for panelists to a minimum while maintaining the highest levels of realism. Since then several versions have been launched, the latest including a powerful Shop Editor, allowing direct interaction with the 3D environments prior to creation of final consumer version. Comparing one 3D store environment against another helps brands understand which in-store concept work more effectively.\n\nIn 2005 FACTBOY, using ACTISKU technology, started selling online 3D virtual research and has grown knowledge and expertise with a high number of online shopper market research projects and became pioneers in this area with a serious number of project in the field. After moving to its own platform in 2007 and continuous platform improvements Factboy has today a performing platform and found a good trade off between performance and quality. FACTBOY based the on development on the 3D engine from Unity3D to ensure seamless web-player installation and content streaming in the background and provides the full production service to clients from store content collection up to data analytics.\n\nIn 2006, a new player called Red Dot Square Solutions emerged from the UK operating initially in the North American market. Red Dot's emphasis was on creating a complete virtual store fully stocked with 3-dimensional objects where shoppers could wander at will. Consumer product companies could then test multiple variables within the full virtual store environment. The company established a network of more than 60 on-site test centers to field research studies using eye tracking technology alongside virtual aisles where respondents interacted with touch screens to examine products. Red Dot Square Solutions was acquired by WPP in 2009.\n\nThe technology is continually developing as companies were eager for the realistic experience of 3D environments combined with lower costs and quicker turnaround times. As a result, in 2009, InContext Solutions developed a technology to stream data-rich, complex 3D objects over the Internet, the solution allowed consumer packaged goods companies to put their consumers in a realistic 3D in-store shopping context, yet still leverage the scalability of online research, enabling them to increase sample sizes, field studies anywhere in the world, and realize significantly faster project completion times while approximating the accuracy levels of in-person store research.\n\nIn 2012 all Factboy activities moved to the operational Team of Factboy and continues the service and solution under ShopperFact brand. ShopperFact and Factboy is managed by ShopperFact, Inc. ( a company owned by the operational, production and R&D Factboy Team) with presence in New York, Miami, Cancun, Mexico City and Germany.\n\nThe long-term promise of virtual store research remains as articulated by Burke in 1996: “One day, the virtual store may become a channel for direct, personal, and intelligent communications with the consumer, one that encompasses research, sales and service.”\n\nMarketing research\n\nVirtual store technology is generally used to answer questions regarding customer decisions within an in-store setting. This includes all of the following:\n\nIntegration with point of sale data\n\nIn 2011, InContext Solutions introduced Visualize InContext, a software tool that allows companies to view actual point-of-sales data within the virtual store environment. Through Visualize InContext, marketers and retailers can see in real time what is happening on the shelf, enabling them to tune their shelf restocking schedules and better optimize planograms for the most efficient product sell–through using actual point-of-sale data.\n\nFusion with Online Shopping\nIn 2017, Buzz 3D introduced their Buzz 3D Retail Suite, which as well as providing 3D Planogram creation, Store Planning and Virtual Store Research functions, leveraged 3D Cloud functionality to permit live access to the Virtual Store from any video-capable device. By defining products within the store individually, and making it simple and cost-effective to create from photography, retailers now have a means of selling through a Virtual Store in addition to just conducting research studies alone.\n\nAdditional applications\n\nVirtual store technologies have additional applications as visualization tools for internal marketing and product development efforts, including the following:\n\n"}
