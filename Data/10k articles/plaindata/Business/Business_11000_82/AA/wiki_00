He has been one of Hong Kong's most commercially successful film actors since the mid-1980s, performing in more than 160 films while maintaining a successful singing career at the same time. In the 1990s, Lau was branded by the media as one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Cantopop & was named as \"Fourth Tiger\" among Five Tiger Generals of TVB\n\nLau was entered into the Guinness World Records for the \"Most Awards Won by a Cantopop Male Artist\". By April 2000, he had already won an unprecedented total of 292 awards. Lau also holds numerous film acting awards, having won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor three times and the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor twice. In 2005, Lau received the \"No.1 Box office Actor 1985–2005\" award of Hong Kong, yielding a box office total of HK$1,733,275,816 for shooting 108 films in the past 20 years, and in 2007, he received the \"Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia\" award by the Nielsen Company (ACNielsen). On 25 June 2018, Lau was invited to be a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nAndy Lau was born in Tai Po, Hong Kong, a son of a fireman (劉禮). His family was considered to be wealthy as his grandfather was a landowner, but his father left with him to the slums of Diamond Hill when he was six, where the area was full of wooden houses, and was burnt down when he was eleven. As a young boy, Lau had to fetch water for his family up to eight times a day because their house was not equipped with plumbing. He graduated from a Band One secondary school, Ho Lap College in San Po Kong, Kowloon. He was named as Lau Fook-wing (劉福榮) during his academic years. He also practices Chinese calligraphy. Lau converted to Buddhism in the 1980s. He was raised in a nominally Buddhist household and is now a follower of the Lingyan Mountain Temple in Taiwan.\n\nIn 1981, Lau signed up for the artist training program offered by TVB, which is where his acting career began. The lead role which led to his initial popularity was in the 1982 TVB series \"The Emissary\". In 1983, Lau's role as \"Yang Guo\" in the TVB \"wuxia\" series, \"The Return of the Condor Heroes\" (神鵰俠侶) further increased his popularity. From then on, he would take on many of the lead roles in many TVB series.\n\nIn September 1983, TVB was looking to increase their ratings in competition with Korea and Japan for the best variety show. The station then created the show \"TVB All-star challenge\" (星光熠熠勁爭輝) featuring almost the entire line-up of the most popular actors and singers at the time. Lau, along with Tony Leung, Michael Miu, Felix Wong, and Kent Tong were branded as the \"Five Tiger Generals of TVB\" (無線五虎將) due to their popularity on the show.\n\nIn the late '80s, Lau left TVB due to contract problems. TVB wanted to bind him to an exclusive five-year contract which Lau refused to sign, so TVB blacklisted him. He then focused on his film career.\n\nIn 1981, Lau made a guest appearance in one of Susanna Kwan's music videos and caught the eye of the manager Teddy Robin. Teddy Robin then gave Lau a chance to play a small role in the movie \"Once Upon a Rainbow\". This was the first step in Lau's film acting career. He landed a role in Ann Hui's 1982 film \"Boat People\". Later in 1983 he had his first leading role in the Shaw Brothers-produced action film, \"On the Wrong Track\".\n\nOne of his early leading roles included the more serious 1988 film, \"The Truth\" (法內情). However, Lau is best known in films for his (often) recurring roles as a \"Heroic Gangster\", such as Wong Kar-wai's 1988 film \"As Tears Go By\", and Benny Chan's 1990 film \"A Moment of Romance\".\n\nThough a respectable actor, Lau was initially known more for his handsome features. Some people he has worked with have called him a matinee idol, but he has claimed to be an artist. Lau has proved his acting skills in many of his films. His first major acting prize came with \"A Fighter's Blues\", which was his first Golden Bauhinia Award for Best Actor. He would win the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor award that year for \"Running out of Time\". In 2004, he won the prestigious Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor for his performance in \"Infernal Affairs III\", the second sequel to the popular \"Infernal Affairs\". He is also known to Western audiences for starring in \"wuxia\" films such as \"House of Flying Daggers\", which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography.\n\nIn 2005, Lau received the \"No.1 Box office Actor 1985–2005\" award of Hong Kong, yielding a box office total of HKD 1,733,275,816 for shooting 108 films in the past 20 years. The aforementioned figure is as compared to the first runner-up Stephen Chow's (HKD 1,317,452,311) and second runner-up Jackie Chan's (HKD 894,090,962). \"I've never imagined that it would be as much as 1.7 billion!\" he told reporters. For his contributions, a wax figure of Lau was unveiled on 1 June, 2005 at the Madame Tussauds Hong Kong. In 2007, Lau also received the \"Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia\" award by the Nielsen Company (ACNielsen).\n\nIn 1991, Lau set up his own film production company, Teamwork Motion Pictures, which in 2002 was renamed to Focus Group Holdings Limited. His contributions in the film industry as well as his involvement in nurturing new talent in the Asian film industry led him to winning the \"Asian Filmmaker of the Year\" award in the Pusan International Film Festival in 2006. Some of the films Lau has produced include award-winning films, \"Made in Hong Kong\" and \"A Simple Life\", his 100th film, \"A Fighter's Blues\" the Chinese digital film \"Crazy Stone\", and big budget action blockbusters, \"Firestorm\" and \"Shock Wave\".\n\nLau released his first album \"Only Know that I Still Love You\" (只知道此刻愛你) under Capital Artists in 1985. This album was not a big hit, but despite having a voice not traditionally associated with popular music, Lau's hard work and perseverance resulted in him becoming one of the most successful singers in Cantopop. His singing career reached stellar status in 1990 with the release of the album entitled \"Would It Be Possible\" (可不可以), and his subsequent releases only solidified his status as a marketable singer. For that song, he would win his first 1990 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. He would then win at least one RTHK award category every year consecutively until the year 2007.\n\nFrom Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards he has won the \"Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist\" award 7 times and the \"Asia Pacific Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist\" award 15 times. He was also entered into the Guinness World Records for \"Most Awards Won by a Cantopop Male Artist\". By April 2000, he had already won an unprecedented total of 292 awards.\n\nMany of Lau's songs quickly topped the music charts not only in Hong Kong, but also in Taiwan, Mainland China, and in many different parts of Asia. Some of his most notable hits include \"The Days We Spent Together\" (一起走過的日子), \"If You Are My Legend\" (如果你是我的傳說), \"The Tide\" (潮水), \"Forget Love Potion\" (忘情水), \"True Forever\" (真永遠), \"Chinese people\" (中國人), \"Love You Forever\" (愛你一萬年), \"You Are My Woman\" (你是我的女人), and \"Secret Admiration\" (暗裡著迷). Besides singing in Cantonese and Mandarin, he has also sung in other languages such as English, Japanese, Malay, and Taiwanese Hokkien. One example of a Hokkien song was (世界第一等), and he has also performed a Cantonese cover of Joan Jett's \"I Hate Myself for Loving You\" (我恨我痴心).\n\nSince the early 1990s, Lau, along with Jacky Cheung, Aaron Kwok, and Leon Lai have been referred to by the Chinese media as the Cantopop Four Heavenly Kings.\n\nLau sang alongside Jackie Chan during a part of the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony on 24 August, 2008. In addition, Lau, who has been supporting disabled athletes in Hong Kong for more than a decade, was appointed as the Goodwill ambassador for the 2008 Summer Paralympics. He led other performers in singing and performing the song \"Everyone is No.1\" at the Beijing National Stadium just a few hours before the 2008 Paralympics opening ceremony began. He also sang the theme song \"Flying with the Dream\" with Han Hong during the Paralympics opening ceremony on 6 September 2008.\n\nAs a songwriter, Lau's only creative works are as a lyricist. Most of the songs he has written have been for himself.\n\nLau is alleged to have been featured as a non-player character (NPC) as a random pedestrian in a sandbox-style action video game called \"Prototype\". On 6 July, the Hong Kong local newspapers Headline Daily and Sing Tao Daily reported on Lau's cameo.\n\nLau was severely injured on 16 January 2017, when he was thrown off and stomped on by a horse during a commercial shoot in Thailand. The commercial was released in March, but with all horses and horse-riding scenes cut from the final version. By the end of 2017, Lau had fully recovered from his injuries.\n\nIn 1994, Lau established the \"Andy Lau Charity Foundation\" which helps people in need and promotes a wide range of youth education services. In 1999, he received the \"Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World\" award, being the third person from Hong Kong at that time to receive this distinguished honour. In 2008, Lau took a main role in putting together the Artistes 512 Fund Raising Campaign for relief toward the victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. It was one of the largest and most ambitious charity events ever assembled in the territory.\n\nLau was noted for his active involvement in charity works throughout his 30 years in showbiz and honoured as a \"Justice of Peace\" by the Hong Kong SAR government in 2008. In May 2010, he received the \"World Outstanding Chinese\" award and an \"honorary doctorate\" from the University of New Brunswick, Canada. On 14 December, 2017, Lau was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree from the Hong Kong Shue Yan University, with the citation highlighting his popularity among locals which stated: “His low-key, modest, friendly and approachable personality has endeared him to millions of fans and ordinary folks alike, who also consider him to be a ‘heartthrob’ and the ‘unofficial Chief Executive of [Hong Kong].”\n\nLau was also named in the Panama Papers leak.\n\nIn 2008, Lau married Malaysian Chinese Carol Chu after 24 years of speculation over their relationship. The couple married in Las Vegas. On 9 May, 2012, Chu gave birth to their first child, a daughter, Hanna. In January 2017, Lau was seriously injured after being thrown off and stomped by a horse during a commercial shoot in Khao Lak, an area three hours outside of Thailand’s capital city, Bangkok. However, Lau was able to make a full return to work in August 2017, stating he has recovered 95 per cent from his injuries and has fully recovered by the end of the year.\n\nIn 2018, asteroid 55381 Lautakwah, discovered by Bill Yeung at the Desert Eagle Observatory in 2001, was named for Lau. The asteroid measures approximately in diameter and is located in the outermost region of the asteroid belt, just inside the Hecuba gap. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 11 July 2018.\n\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #DAA520;\" | Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation\n\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #DAA520;\" | Hong Kong Film Awards\n\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #DAA520;\" | Ming Pao Power Academy Awards\n"}

Most State Chambers and associations have local offices to provide services in close proximity to members. \n\nCompulsory membership by Austrian federal law is automatic with obtaining the operating licence of the company and thus includes all Austrian companies in operation. The resultant membership of 517.477 active businesses as per 2017 includes diverse sectors such as trade and craft, commerce, industry, transportation, tourism, services industries, finance and insurance, but not agriculture, as this sector is served by its own Chamber.\n\nRepresentation of membership interests at all levels of government. By law governments are obliged to consult with Chambers on legislative projects and important regulation. In many laws a provision is made to involve Chambers in decision-making and administrative procedures. \nInformation and advisory service to members: Typical issues include taxation, labour law, vocational training, industry-specific legislation, industry-wide advertising and market research.\n\nTrade associations engage in negotiations with their respective sectoral countrywide union. \nEconomic Promotion and Development as well as training and consulting are mainly organised by a specialised department in each region (WIFI, Wirtschaftsfoerderungsinstitut).\n\nBusiness Support and Promotion of International Trade is provided by a specialised department at a national level (AWO - AUSSENWIRTSCHAFT ÖSTERREICH), 110 field offices around the world (Austrian Trade Commissions) plus a network of specialised experts within the State Chambers. \nPublic law (Wirtschaftskammergesetz) provides a legal foundation for the Austrian Federal Economic Chambers, supplying the legal framework for all Chambers, their co-operation, mandatory membership, and rules for setting membership fees. Although established by public law the Federal Economic Chambers are exclusively business driven.\n\nEvery 5 years entrepreneurs elect officers and representatives for the trade associations and the Chamber (amounting to a total of more than 10.000 officers) from their own ranks. In these elections free associations of entrepreneurs field their candidates to compete for the leadership of the Chambers and individual trade associations. Some of these entrepreneurial associations are affiliated with political parties while others are independent platforms. Since 1999,Dr. Christoph Leitl has been elected President of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber thrice.\nThe Austrian Federal Economic Chamber is financially self-sufficient with around 85% of expenditure covered by member contributions and a further 15% by revenues from marketable sales. This factor, combined with organisational management through democratic self-government, makes us fully independent from public authorities.\n\nIn Austria the promotion of foreign trade constitutes, by law, one major part of the activities of the Economic Chamber. The immense importance of foreign trade to Austria is reflected in the extraordinary range of services provided by AdvantageAustria.org (AWO - AUSSENWIRTSCHAFT ÖSTERREICH) with an international network of 113 Austrian Trade Offices worldwide, in most cases sections of the Austrian embassies in the respective countries.\n\nFurthermore, AdvantageAustria.org offers Austrian businesses a wide range of complementary services including: specialist services related to Austria's EU membership, information and advice. The primary aim is to help create and sustain successful sales and promotion of Austrian goods and services in international markets.\n\nAdvantageAustria.org is also responsible for the organization of trade missions and official participation in international trade fairs and provides advice and assistance to inbound buying missions.\n\nThe heads of each Austrian Trade Offices, the Austrian Trade Commissioners or Delegates, help Austrian companies to find new contacts and develop existing business. Trade Commissioners put buyers in contact with potential agents, importers and co-operation partners. They also obtain credit ratings and assist with trade name and patent registration.\n\n"}

It was released in the \"Acornsoft Education\" range and includes two business simulation games; \"Stokmark\" and \"Telemark\".\n\n\"Stokmark\" is a simulation of the stock market. Up to eight players take turns to either buy or sell shares in a choice of four companies. As well as the price, players are given the price-to-earnings ratio and dividend yield. Prices change instantly when transactions are made (usually based on the standard supply and demand principle although there is a random element). After each round a news story is displayed which affects the value of certain shares. After every four rounds, players are awarded dividends on the shares they hold and are ranked on their total current value (of both cash and shares). The object of the game is to make the largest amount of profit.\n\n\"Telemark\" is a four player game where each player has to make decisions based on the manufacturing of televisions. This includes whether to build or extend factories, spend on improving management or marketing, and setting the price. When the player enters their price, it is not displayed on the screen so other players do not know what their competitors are charging until the end of each round. The game introduces terms and reports such as market share, overheads, profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. The instruction booklet provides detailed instructions on working out the break-even point as well as blank worksheets to be filled out by the players. The winner is the player who has made the most profit after a set number of rounds or the first player to gain more than half the market share for televisions.\n\n\"Business Games\" was released in 1983 as part of Acornsoft's Education range which was aimed at schools as well as home users. As it only requires 16k RAM, it runs on the BBC Micro Model A as well as the Model B. It was also released for the Acorn Electron in 1984. The instructions recommend the games for teaching business and economic studies but the Acorn Electron version in particular was well known among home users, as it was often included with the Acornsoft software packs bundled with Electrons in 1984 and 1985.\n\nThe package was reviewed by Ken Garrett for The Micro User which was largely positive. \"Stokmark\" was described as \"a well-presented and useful introduction to some investment terms\" but also \"rather repetitive\". He claimed \"Telemark\" is \"a good game and to be properly appreciated must be played seriously\".\n"}

{"id": "221254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221254", "title": "Estoppel", "text": "Estoppel\n\nEstoppel is a judicial device in common law legal systems whereby a court may prevent, or \"estop\" a person from making assertions or from going back on his or her word; the person being sanctioned is \"estopped\". Estoppel may prevent someone from bringing a particular claim, particularly if a promise unsupported by consideration is being relied on by the other party. Legal doctrines of estoppel are based in both common law and equity. \n\nIt is also a concept in international law.\n\nThere are many different types of estoppel which can arise, but the common thread between them is that a person is restrained from asserting a particular position in law where it would be inequitable to do so. By way of illustration:\n\n\nEstoppel is an equitable doctrine. Accordingly, any person wishing to assert an estoppel must normally come to the court with \"clean hands\".\n\nThe doctrine of estoppel (which may prevent a party from asserting a right) is often confused with the doctrine of waiver (which relates to relinquishing a right once it has arisen). It also substantially overlaps with, but is distinct from, the equitable doctrine of laches.\n\nThe verb is \"estop\", which comes from Middle English \"estoppen\", itself borrowed from Old French \"estop(p)er\", \"estouper\", presumably from Vulgar Latin *\"stuppāre.\" 'to stop up with tow, caulk', from Latin \"stuppa\", 'broken flax', from Ancient Greek \"stuppe\", 'broken flax'. The noun form \"estoppel\" is based on the Old French \"estoupail,\" 'stopper, bung', a derivative of \"estouper\".\n\nWhere a court finds that a party has done something warranting a form of estoppel, that party is said to be estopped from making certain related arguments or claiming certain related rights. The defendant is estopped from presenting the related defence, or the plaintiff is estopped from making the related argument against the defendant. Lord Coke stated, \"It is called an estoppel or conclusion, because a man's own act or acceptance stoppeth or closeth up his mouth to allege or plead the truth.\"\n\nEstoppel is sometimes said to be a rule of evidence whereby a person is barred from leading evidence of a fact that has already been settled or they are otherwise precluded from asserting, but that may be an oversimplification. Firstly, although some estoppels relate to preventing a party from asserting \"facts\", others relate to preventing a party from asserting a \"right\" or a \"claim\". Secondly, under the conflict of laws in common law jurisdictions, matters of evidence are usually treated as procedural matters for the law of the local court (the \"lex fori\"), whereas it is generally accepted that an estoppel may affect substantive rights and are therefore matters to be determined by the proper law (or \"lex causae\") that governs the particular issue.\n\nThere are many different types of estoppel that can arise under common law legal systems. It has been judicially noted on more than one occasion that the link between them is often somewhat tenuous. \"Treitel on Contracts\" notes that \"unconscionability...provides the link between them\", but they nevertheless have \"separate requirements and different terrains of application\". The courts have long abandoned an attempt to create a single general underlying rationale or principle:\nThe plea of estoppel is often closely connected with the plea of waiver, the object of both being to ensure bona fides in day-to-day transactions. It is also related to the doctrines of variation and election. It is applied in many areas of contract law, including insurance, banking, and employment. In English law, the concept of legitimate expectation in the realm of administrative law and judicial review is estoppel's counterpart in public law.\n\nPromissory estoppel is often applied where there is an agreement without a consideration, or the consideration is future-based (as a promise). When applied in defense by a defendant it may be called a \"shield\", and where applied by a plaintiff it may be called a \"sword\". It is most commonly used as a shield, with some commentators stating that it can only be used as a shield, although this varies with jurisdictions.\n\nEstoppel can be understood by considering examples such as the following:\n\n\nSome types of estoppel under English, Australian, and American laws are as follows:\n\n\n\nReliance-based estoppels (at English law) include:\nBoth \"Halsbury's\" and Spencer Bower (see below) describe these three estoppels collectively as estoppels by representation. More simply, one party must say or do something and see the other party rely on what is said or done to change behavior.\n\nAll reliance-based estoppels require the victimised party to show both \"inducement\" and \"detrimental reliance\", i.e.:\n\nSimply put, promissory estoppel has four necessary elements which the plaintiff must prove:\n\nEstoppel by representation of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: the former is based on a representation of existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter is based on a promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e. it expresses an intention as to the future). A promissory estoppel operates only between parties who, at the time of the representation, were in an existing relationship, while this is not a requirement for estoppel by representation of fact.\n\nThe test for unconscionability in the English and Australian courts takes many factors into account, including the behavior, state of mind and circumstances of the parties. Generally, the following eight factors are determinative:\n\nBut in \"Cobbe v Yeoman's Row\", Lord Scott of Foscote stated the following:\n\nIn English law, estoppel by representation of fact is a term coined by Spencer Bower. This species of estoppel is also referred to as \"common law estoppel by representation\" in \"Halsbury's Laws of England\", vol 16(2), 2003 reissue.\n\nSpencer Bower defines estoppel by representation of fact as follows:\n\nA second definition comes from Sean Wilken and Theresa Villiers:\n\nA representation can be made by words or conduct. Although the representation must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care has arisen. Under English law, estoppel by representation of fact usually acts as a defence, though it may act in support of a cause of action or counterclaim.\n\nUnder English and Australian legal systems, \"estoppels in equity\" include promissory and proprietary estoppels, described below. (Contrast with estoppel by representation, which is a claim (under the English system) at law.)\n\nIn English law, \"proprietary estoppel\" is distinct from promissory estoppel. \"Proprietary estoppel\" is not a concept in American law, but a similar result is often reached under the general doctrine of promissory estoppel.\n\nTraditionally, \"proprietary estoppel\" arose in relation to rights to use the land of the owner, and possibly in connection with disputed transfers of ownership. Although proprietary estoppel was only traditionally available in disputes affecting title to real property, it has now gained limited acceptance in other areas of law. Proprietary estoppel is closely related to the doctrine of constructive trust.\n\nJ. Fry summarized the five elements for proprietary estoppel as:\n\n\nExample: A father promised a house to his son who took possession and spent a large sum of money improving the property, but the father never actually transferred the house to the son. Upon the father's death, the son claimed to be the equitable owner. The court found the testamentary trustees (as representatives of the deceased father's estate) were \"estopped\" from denying the son's proprietary interest, and ordered them to convey the land to the son.\n\nThe doctrine of \"promissory estoppel\" prevents one party from withdrawing a promise made to a second party if the latter has reasonably relied on that promise.\n\nA promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable. It is known as a bare or gratuitous promise. Thus, if a car salesman promises a potential buyer not to sell a certain car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. But should the car salesman accept from the potential buyer even one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise will be enforceable in court by the potential buyer. Estoppel extends the court's purview even to cases where there is no consideration, though it is generally not a 'sword': not a basis on which to initiate a lawsuit.\n\nThe doctrine of \"promissory estoppel\" was first developed in \"Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co\" [1877] but was lost for some time until it was resurrected by Denning J in the controversial case of \"Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd\".\n\nPromissory estoppel requires:\n\nIn general, estoppel is \"a shield not a sword\"—it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In \"High Trees\" the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent from early 1945, and could have restored the full rent at any time after the initial promise was made provided a suitable period of notice had been given. In this case, the estoppel was applied to a \"negative promise\", that is, one where a party promises not to enforce full rights.\n\nEstoppel is an equitable (as opposed to common law) construct and its application is therefore discretionary. In the case of \"D & C Builders v. Rees\" the courts refused to recognise a promise to accept a part payment of £300 on a debt of £482 on the basis that it was extracted by duress. In \"Combe v. Combe\" Denning elaborated on the equitable nature of estoppel by refusing to allow its use as a \"sword\" by an ex-wife to extract funds from the destitute husband.\n\nThe general rule is that when one party agrees to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, the debtor has given no consideration, and so the creditor is still entitled to claim the debt in its entirety. This is not the case if the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed, because the benefit to the creditor of receiving payment early can be thought of as consideration for the promise to waive the rest of the debt. This is the rule formulated in \"Pinnel's Case\", and affirmed in \"Foakes v Beer\".\n\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal in \"Collier v P & MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd\" suggests that the doctrine of promissory estoppel can now operate to mitigate the harshness of this common law rule. Moreover, Arden LJ held that allowing a creditor to renege on his promise to forebear seeking the balance of a debt in return for part payment would be, in and of itself, inequitable. Therefore, the only reliance that the promisee must demonstrate is the actual making of the part payment. This approach has been criticised as doing violence to the principle set down in Hughes and the extent to which the other members of the Court, namely Longmore LJ, agreed with it is uncertain.\n\nEquitable estoppel is the American counterpart to estoppel by representation. Its elements are summarized as:\n\nFor example, in \"Aspex Eyewear v. Clariti Eyewear\", eyeglass frame maker Aspex sued competitor Clariti for patent infringement. Aspex waited three years, without responding to a request that it list the infringed patent claims, before asserting its patent in litigation. During this period, Clariti expanded its marketing and sales of the products. The Federal Circuit found that Aspex misled Clariti to believe it would not enforce its patent, and thus estopped Aspex from proceeding with the suit.\n\nIn many jurisdictions of the United States, \"promissory estoppel\" is an alternative to consideration as a basis for enforcing a promise. It is also sometimes called \"detrimental reliance.\"\n\nThe American Law Institute in 1932 included the principle of estoppel into § 90 of the Restatement of Contracts, stating:\n\nHowever:\n\nSuppose that B goes to a store and sees a sign that the price of a radio is $10. B tells the shopkeeper that he will get the money and come back later that day to purchase it; there is no discussion of price. The shopkeeper says that when B returns, he will welcome B as a customer—unless he sells all three of his radios first. Hearing this, B goes and sells his watch for $10 (it was really worth $15, but since B wanted the money right away, he chose not to wait for the best price). When B returns, the sign says $11, and the owner tells B that he has raised the price. In equity, can you argue that the shopkeeper is estopped by conduct? B relied upon the implied representation that a radio would be sold for $10 when he returned with the money; B has sold his watch at a discount, to his detriment. (This element would be absent if B sold the watch at the market price.) But the shopkeeper did not guarantee to hold one of the radios against the possibility of B's return nor did they agree a fixed price.\n\nIn some common-law jurisdictions, a promise by the shopkeeper to hold a specific radio would create a binding contract, even if B had to go for the money. A \"promise\" to pay the owner in the future is good consideration if it is made in exchange for a promise to sell a specific radio (one from three is probably sufficiently specific): one promise in exchange for a second promise creates equal value. So the shopkeeper's actual words and knowledge are critical to deciding whether either a contract or an estoppel arises.\n\nThe drafters of the Second Restatement debated how to calculate the amount of damages flowing from a promissory estoppel, using the following example: A young man's uncle promises to give him $1,000 to buy a car. The young man buys a car for $500, but the uncle refuses to pay any money. Is the young man entitled to $1,000 (the amount promised), or merely $500 (the amount he actually lost)? The Restatement states that \"The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.\"—leaving quantification to the discretion of the court. In practice, however, a recent study of over 300 promissory estoppel cases decided under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts has found that many courts continue to enforce the promise to the full extent (i.e., $1,000 in the example above).\n\n\"Estoppel in pais\" (literally \"by act of notoriety\", or \"solemn formal act\") is the historical root of common law estoppel by representation and equitable estoppel. The terms \"Estoppel in pais\" and equitable estoppel are used interchangeably in American law.\n\n\"Estoppel by convention\" in English law (also known as \"estoppel by agreement\") occurs where two parties negotiate or operate a contract but make a mistake. If they share an assumption, belief, or understanding of the contract's interpretation or legal effect, then they are bound by it, if:\n\n\nEstoppel by convention is most commonly invoked if one party wishes to rely on pre-contract negotiation as an aid to construction of the contract.\n\nIt is debatable whether \"estoppel by convention\" is a separate estoppel doctrine, or merely a case of \"reliance-based estoppel\" (\"estoppel by representation\" would be its most frequent form), or of the rule of interpretation that, where words in a contract are ambiguous, one always interprets those words so as to give effect to the actual intentions of the parties even if that would not be the usual legal outcome (see \"Amalgamated Investment and Property Co. Ltd. v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd\" [1982] QB 84).\n\n\"Estoppel by acquiescence\" may arise when one person gives a legal warning to another based on some clearly asserted facts or legal principle, and the other does not respond within \"a reasonable period of time\". By \"acquiescing\", the other person is generally considered to have lost the legal right to assert the contrary.\n\nAs an example, suppose that Jill has been storing her car on Jack's land with no contract between them. Jack sends a registered letter to Jill's legal address, stating: \"I am no longer willing to allow your car to stay here for free. Please come get your car, or make arrangements to pay me rent for storing it. If you do not do so, within 30 days, I will consider the car abandoned and will claim ownership of it. If you need more time to make arrangements, please contact me within 30 days, and we can work something out.\" If Jill does not respond, she may be said to have \"relinquished\" her ownership of the car, and \"estoppel by acquiescence\" may prevent any court from invalidating Jack's actions of registering the car in his name and using it as his own.\n\nThe law relating to contractual estoppel (in English law) was summarised in :\n\n\"Estoppel by deed\" is a rule of evidence arising from the status of a contract signed under seal—such agreements, called deeds, are more strictly enforced than ordinary contracts and the parties are expected to take greater care to verify the contents before signing them. Hence, once signed, all statements of fact (usually found in the opening recital which sets out the reason(s) for making the deed) are conclusive evidence against the parties who are estopped from asserting otherwise.\n\n\"[O]ne who by his speech or conduct has induced another to act in a particular manner ought not be permitted to adopt an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct may not be adopted to loss or injury of another\". For example, as between two or more claimants, a party that takes multiple and inconsistent legal positions is estopped to assert its positions against another consistent and certain claim, i.e. preferential treatment for certain over uncertain claims.\n\nIssue estoppel (more commonly known as issue preclusion) prevents, in some cases, an issue that has already been litigated and decided on the merits from being re-litigated, even when the parties are different. In the world of crime, some cases have achieved notoriety, e.g. in the Birmingham Six saga, the House of Lords ruled in \"Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982)\" that \"issue estoppel\" applied. Lord Diplock said:\n\nA variant of issue estoppel also precludes a party from bringing a claim in subsequent proceedings which ought properly to have been brought as part of earlier legal proceedings.\n\nThe doctrine of promissory estoppel was adopted into Australian law in \"Legione v Hateley\". However, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful in that case because the reliance was unreasonable and the promise not unequivocal.\n\nAustralian law has now gone beyond the position espoused in the English \"High Trees\" case, to cases where there is no pre-existing legal relationship between the two parties, and promissory estoppel can be wielded as a \"sword\", not just as a \"shield\". Mason CJ and Wilson J in \"Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher\" held that if estoppel is proven, it gives rise to an equity in favour of the plaintiff, and the court will do the minimum equity that is just in the circumstances. From this case, it is also possible for the promise to come from silence or inaction.\n\nStated by Brennan J in \"Waltons Stores\": \n\nAlthough there is some debate as to whether \"unconscionability\" is an element that English courts need to take into account when considering estoppel by representation of fact, the Australian courts clearly do. This element is satisfied if one party encourages the other party to create assumptions that lead to reliance.\n\nToday, the principle of estoppel may give birth to an enforceable obligation even without a consideration under the following conditions:\n\nWhen enforcing an estoppel, Australian courts will look to the impact that enforcement will have on others, especially third parties. Relief in estoppel thus remains discretionary, and will not always be granted based on the expectation of the plaintiff.\n\nThe status of estoppel by representation of fact is less clear in Australia. Two seminal decisions purport to fuse common law and equitable estoppels into a single unified doctrine, but the New South Wales Court of Appeal continues to treat estoppel by representation at common law as distinct from equitable estoppel. This can be significant in deciding which court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue.\n\nWhilst there also exists a doctrine of proprietary estoppel, the High Court of Australia merged this doctrine with the doctrine of promissory estoppel by virtue of their similar criteria.\n\nNonetheless, authority for the doctrine of proprietary estoppel indicates that if a landlord allows a licensee to expend money on the land under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he/she will be able to remain there, and the licensee suffers a detriment in relying on that expectation, an equity arises in the licensee such as to entitle him/her to stay. Where a proprietary estoppel is found to exist, the court does not have to grant the plaintiff a proprietary interest in the land subject to the dispute. It may instead make an order that the plaintiff receive equitable compensation.\n\nSection 115 of the Indian Evidence Act defines estoppel: \"When one person has, by his declaration, act or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.\"\n\nSo, for instance, if A intentionally and falsely leads B to believe that certain land belongs to A, and thereby induces B to buy and pay for it, and only later does A acquire the land, then A is not allowed to argue to void the sale on the ground that, at the time of the sale, he had no title.\n\nThe doctrine of estoppel is based on the principle that consistency in word and action imparts certainty and honesty to human affairs. If a person makes a representation to another, on the faith of which the latter acts, to his prejudice, the former cannot recant the representation.\n\nHowever, estoppel has no application to representations made regarding the fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution of India, the source of all laws, which exists not only to benefit individuals but to secure collective rights. Thus, no one can barter away the freedoms conferred upon him by the Constitution. A concession made by him in a proceeding, whether under a mistake of law or otherwise, that he does not possess or will not enforce any particular fundamental right, cannot estop him, as enforcing estoppel would defeat the purpose of the Constitution.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43527514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43527514", "title": "Grill family", "text": "Grill family\n\nThe Grill family was one of several Swedish families having significant influence with the Swedish East India Company (SOIC). During the 17th century, 18th century and for some years into the 19th century, they owned ironworks and mills manufacturing goods for export while operating wharfs, textile companies, saw mills and other factories related to shipbuilding. Several Grills were directors of the SOIC and the Grill firm traded with the merchants in Canton (now known as Guangzhou) as members of the SOIC and privately. The Grills owned houses, manors and estates at a number of locations in Sweden.\n\nAll the noted Grills were in some way connected to the main Grill Trading House, and several other companies were established in association with the Trading House. The Grill name was kept and passed on through the generations and some of the Grills even shared the same first name.\n\nApart from the SOIC, the Grills are most noted for their contribution to the Swedish iron industry and for exports of iron during the 18th century.\n\nOriginating in Genoa, Italy, part of the family moved to Augsburg, Germany where on 29July 1571, Andreas Grill received burgher arms with their own coat of arms. from the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe name Grill comes from the Italian \"Grillo\", meaning cricket, while the family's coat of arms displays a crane holding a cricket in its beak.\n\nThe family came to Sweden with the arrival of the silversmith Anthoni Grill (I), grandson of Andreas Grill, born in Augsburg and from 1638, a burgess in Amsterdam. He was the \"Riksguardie\" (National Appraiser) for the Myntverket in 1658 to 1667, where he supervised the making of coins and made sure that measurements were standardized throughout Sweden. He was not especially good at his work and in 1663, he was demoted to handle smaller goods in gold and silver. He was succeeded at the Myntverket by his son Anthoni Grill (II), who also bought the Grill house at Stortorget in Stockholm.\n\nDuring the 18th century the family was described as members of the \"Skeppsbroadeln\" (the Skeppsbro Nobility). The name was coined during the 18th century and referred to the wealthiest merchant families in Stockholm at that time, especially those who lived by the quays along the Skeppsbron.\n\nThe family consisted of two branches —the Garphyttan branch and the Godegård branch. The Grill family is included in the \"Ointroducerad Adels Förening\" (Association of the Unintroduced Nobility), an association for Swedish citizens whose family was ennobled in a foreign country, as well as some families who were ennobled in Sweden but for some reason never introduced at the Swedish House of Nobility.\n\nA section of the Grill family tree showing some noted members.\n\nNumbers attached to some of the names do not form an official part of their name but are provided as a convenient way of referring to identically named Grills.\n\nAbraham Grill (167420 March 1725) was a Swedish merchant. Married three times, he had seven children and was the son of Anthoni (II) as well as heir to the Grill family fortune, which he increased through trade speculation. During the Great Northern War led by King Charles XII, he gave large sums of money to the state and during a time of famine he sold grains at reduced price to the needy. He was also the driving force behind the founding of a house for poor elderly widows in Stockholm on 14July 1724.\n\nIn 1716, he and his brother Carlos Grill, founded the Grill Trading House. The house traded mainly in wrought iron and became one of the leading trading houses in Stockholm during the 18th century. During its first year the company bought reclaimed land, from the Countess Elisabeth Oxenstierna, in the east part of Stockholm. The land was used to establish the Terra Nova Wharf, also known as the \"Köpmannavarvet\" (the Merchants Wharf), where a number of the ships for the SOIC were built.\n\nWhen Abraham died in 1725, his share of the Trading House went to his son Claes (I). At the death of Carlos in 1736, Claes (I) was sole owner of the company until his half-brother Johan Abraham joined him as partner. Johan Abraham continued to run the Trading House after Claes (I)'s death in 1767. In 1799, Johan Abraham died and the company went bankrupt.\n\nAbraham Grill (28 January 170728 January 1768) was the brother of Anthoni (III) and Claes (I), and half-brother to Johan Abraham. He started his career as Swedish consul in Helsingør in 1733 to 1736. During his time in Denmark he met Anna Maria Petersen, and they were married in 1735. They had thirteen children of which five died at an early age.\n\nAbraham and his family moved to Gothenburg in 1746, where he established a trading house. That year, he was also one of the directors for the SOIC during the second charter. He cooperated closely with the two other trading houses in the Grill family at that time: Carlos & Claes Grill in Stockholm and Anthony & Johannes Grill in Amsterdam. Abraham's trading house handled most of the copper exported from Gothenburg during a few years in the 1760s. The company also exported iron and tea, brought to Gothenburg by the SOIC.\n\nOne of Abraham's many children, Lorentz Grill, became his partner in the trading house in 1761. At the death of Abraham (on his birthday) in 1768, Lorentz sought out new partners and continued running the company.\n\nJohan Abraham Grill (171916 March 1799) was a Swedish merchant and politician. He was the son of Abraham (I), , and Katarina Rozelius, half-brother to Claes (I) and uncle to Jean Abraham. He married Christina Elisabeth Fischer (1731–1805). It was Johan Abraham who introduced a motto for the Grill family: \"Ärlighet warar längst\" (Honesty is the best policy.).\n\nIn 1747, Johan Abraham became partner in the Grill Trading House. Throughout his career he held a number of official positions and received several awards. In 1763, he became a board member in the \"Jernkontoret\" (The Iron Trade Association), established in 1747, it is the oldest trade association in Sweden. In 1767, he was a member of the \"Sjöförsäkringsrätten\" (The Naval Insurance Court) where he handled disputes related to shipping that could not be settled in any other way. With the third charter, he became director of the SOIC in 1770. At the same time he was an accountant and also responsible for credits and loans issued from the Swedish State to various companies.\n\nJohan Abraham was a member of the hat party and helped finance the Swedish court and the hats activity in the Riksdag 1771–72, especially in connection to King Gustav III's coup d'état on 19August 1772, whereby the king's power was solidified. The money for the coup had to be smuggled out from the Grill House in Stockholm, to the Royal castle in double bottom, wooden troughs filled with mortar.\n\nAnthoni Grill (19 April 170522 March 1783) was the twin brother to Claes (I), he was married to Alida Jacoba Hilke with whom he had four children. He lived in Amsterdam where he, and his brother Johannes, owned the Antoni Grill & Sons Trading House. In 1773, he became owner of the Garphyttan factories when the previous owner failed to repay the money he had borrowed from Anthoni (III). To be able to manage the factories, Anthoni (III), and his family, moved to Stockholm where he lived until his death in 1783.\n\nClaes Grill (19 April 17056 November 1767) was a Swedish merchant and factory owner. Claes was the son of Abraham (I) Grill and Helena Wittmark and twin brother to Anthoni Grill. Claes married his uncle's daughter, Anna Johanna (I) Grill (1720–1778), a woman famed for her beauty. They had two children, a daughter named Anna Johanna (II) 1745–1801) and Adolf Ulric.\n\nClaes started to work for his father and at the age of 17 when he was employed at Abrahams office in the Grill Trading House. After the death of Abraham (I), Claes became director of the Trading House, and ran the company together with his uncle Carlos. The name of the company was changed to \"Carlos & Claes Grill\", at that time one of the largest trading company in Sweden. After the death of Carlos in 1736, he was sole head of the firm until 1747, when his half-brother joined him as partner. Since the family had connections to the Netherlands, Claes went there in 1731 or 1732, to further his education and gain more experience with the trading business.\n\nDuring the mid 18th century, the Grill Trading House flourished both in Sweden and abroad. They were connected to hundreds of trading houses in Europe. Foremost was the export of goods to Hamburg, Amsterdam and England. The Dutch Grill company, Antoni Grill & Sons based in Amsterdam acted as a centre for payments to the Grill trading house in Stockholm. The Anglo-Swedish company run by Andrew & Charles Lindegren in London handled all the exports, shipping documents, vessel clearances, and insurance for the Grill Trading House. They also supplied Swedish ships with transit cargoes from England to the countries around the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nDuring the second charter of the SOIC between 1746 and 1766, the Grill Trading House was one of the leading companies in the East India trade. They were partners in a large linen and rigging factory as well as a glass factory in Stockholm. They leased the Stora Stads wharf in Stockholm, owned the Terra Nova wharf and had interests in the Djurgården wharf. All three wharfs built ships for both the SOIC and foreign customers.\n\nThe Grill Trading House also ran a banking business for Swedes traveling abroad. Since the company was connected to so many other trading houses, they could issue bills of exchange for travelers and diplomats to be redeemed at trading houses in other countries. Under the direction of Claes, the trading house acquired several factories and ironworks: Söderfors 1748, Österbybruk with the Dannemora mine (1750) and Iggesund (1753). The main exports from these factories were iron, copper, lumber and tar. Imports consisted of salt from Portugal, oak and hemp from the Baltic states, also wine, coffee, sugar, cheese, tobacco and textiles. Claes ran his companies in an old-fashioned, patriarchal way writing letters every week to his managers at the estates concerning everything from the running of the factories to making enquiries about individual employees. Overall, the Grills industrial companies employed more than 4,000 persons at that time.\n\nWith the building of the manor in Österbybruk, it became the hub for all the iron and mining activities of the Grill Trading House, although Claes and his family did not live there permanently. They lived in the Grill house in Stockholm until 1764, when he bought the Torstensonska Palace (now known as the Arvfurstens palats) at Gustav Adolfs torg, Stockholm. The summers were spent at Svindersvik, a country residence outside Stockholm, built by Claes in the early 1740s.\n\nClaes was an art collector and his houses were decorated with Chinese objects as well as paintings by Swedish and Dutch masters like Alexander Roslin, Gustaf Lundberg, Hans Memling and David Teniers. He owned six complete sets of porcelain tableware commissioned from Canton. , the oldest and largest of these still has 325 pieces preserved. Imported porcelain broken in transit from China or by daily household use became decorative gravel used on the garden paths at one of the Grills' estates. This example of wasting money and resources was condemned by those who opposed the activities of the SOIC. Even noted botanist Carl Linnaeus was at first an opponent. He wrote: \"A part of the silver, which withstands the wear and tear of time and which even fire cannot destroy, we exchange for fragile objects of clay, which, once dropped, cannot be mended.\"\n\nClaes was interested in natural science and contributed to different projects, such as helping Carl Linnaeus financially and with the collection of plants and animal specimens from foreign lands. In 1740, he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He gave financial support to young scientists and naturalists, lent money (without interest) to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the construction of an observatory, contributed a substantial sum of money to the Danviken Hospital and saved the Sveriges Riksbank (the central bank of Sweden) from bankruptcy in 1747 by buying banknotes at their nominal value. In 1748, he became \"preses\" or president of the Royal Academy of Sciences and was elected to the board of directors at the central bank of Sweden, a position he held until 1756. Claes was also awarded the honorary title of \"kommerseråd\" (\"trade counselor\") by King Adolf Frederick. In 1755, he was one of the initiating founders of the Factory Academy, a social network for factory owners in central Sweden.\n\nBetween 1748 and 1750, Claes was a member of the Bourgeoisie in the Riksdag of the Estates and politically involved with the Hats. He was also one of the partners in the infamous \"Växelkontoret\" (Exchange office), a private financial institution handling mainly promissory notes without the involvement of the central bank. When the Caps became the ruling party in 1765, Claes, along with his half-brother Johan Abraham and all the other members of the \"Växelkontoret\", were accused of corruption and mishandling its affairs. In 1765, Claes and Johan Abraham, were fined by the Justice deputation of the Riksdag, and in 1766, they were sentenced to pay back \"five barrels of gold\" to the \"Växelkontoret\". When the Hats regained their political power in the Riksdag the following year, the sentence was revoked, but by then Claes had died.\n\nJean Abraham Grill (21July 173612March 1792), sometimes called Johan Abraham Grill, was a Swedish merchant, supercargo and director of the SOIC as well as an ironmaster. Jean Abraham was the oldest son of merchant Abraham (II), and Anna Maria Petersen.\n\nHe journeyed to China twice, was shipwrecked the second time, and lived in Canton as well as Macao for almost ten years. He was the representative in Canton for the SOIC, buying goods for the company during the arrival of three ships, plus the shipwrecked \"Fredric Adolph\". He also had two trading companies, one together with Michael Grubb, trading with the countries close to China, and one of his own, which he used for trading tea and smuggling opium from India to China.\n\nWhen he returned to Sweden, he bought the Godegård ironworks and manor, along with several other ironworks, that he renovated and improved.\nAll his notes, correspondence, accounts, cargo lists and books are preserved in the Godegård Archive.\n\nClaes Grill (2 September 17502 August 1816) was a Swedish merchant. He was the son of Abraham Grill (II) . In 1770, he settled down in London, where he met and married Maria Hackson. They had three children.\n\nIn 1770, Claes became partner in the Anglo-Swedish company Andrew & Charles Lindegren, a London-based importer of Swedish iron. Andrew & Charles Lindegren traded with the Carlos & Claes Grill (the Grill Trading House) and was the major supplier of iron to the British East India Company. The name of the company was changed first to Lindegren & Grill, and later to Lindegren son & Grill. By that name, the company continued to serve as an agent for the East India Company in Portsmouth.\n\nClaes became Counsel General to London in 1786 to 1815, Both he and William Chalmers applied for that position, but Claes was better known in the London society, had lived longer in England and was connected to a large trading house. By the time he died in Chelsea in 1816, Claes was also partners with a merchant, Harrison, in London.\n\nJacob Grill (17341799) was a Swedish ironworks owner. He was born in Amsterdam, the son of Anthoni Grill (III). He never married and had no children.\n\nJacob moved to Sweden with his father and his brothers when his father became owner of the Garphyttan ironworks. In 1769, Jacob became the owner of the Skebo and Ortala ironworks, the Norrtälje gun factory and the Männäis blast furnace in Nykyrka, Åbo, when the previous owner was forced to sell due to financial difficulties. During his time at Skebo, Jacob built the Skebo Manor in 1767 to 1770. He was very inexperienced in how to operate the ironworks, and they gradually became the property of his lender, the Tottie & Arfwedson Trading House, and in 1782, the transfer was complete. Jacob moved to Broby, then Graneberg and finally to Nyköping where he died penniless.\n\nAdolf (Adolph) Ulric Grill (19 March 17521 October 1797) was a Swedish ironworks owner and scientific collector of animals and fossils for his cabinet of curiosities at Söderfors. He married his cousin, Anna Johanna (III) (1753–1809) in Stockholm on 7June 1778, they had one son who died at an early age. At the time of his marriage, Adolf Ulric lived in the Grill house in Stockholm. He and his wife moved to Söderfors when he inherited the ironworks and manor from his father Claes (I) in 1767.\n\nAdolf Ulric was a dedicated and hands-on owner of the ironworks at Söderfors, who supervised the operation and managed the books. Initially the factory's main products were anchors but with additions and improvements to the facilities he expanded into the production of wrought and pig iron amongst other goods. The products from the ironworks were of good quality and production peaked in 1780.\n\nLike his father, he was a natural scientist and he collected mounted animals, fossils, minerals and plants in a museum, started in 1783, at the Söderfors manor. The first specimens were collected in the vicinity of Söderfors. After two years Adolf Ulric moved on to the birds of the archipelago. He was able to use his connections through his relatives in the trading houses, to send for specimens from Greenland and China. The collections were also increased during his travels and on a journey to England in 1788, he traded a mounted moose for 60 rare birds.\n\nIn 1786, Adolf Ulric built a separate house at the manor for the zoological collection. At that time it contained 116 mounted mammals, 600 birds, 700 seashells and 39 fishes. The collection was displayed as a full size diorama, the centerpiece being a cliff with mounted lions, tigers with cubs, leopards and a number of other animals surrounding the cliff, the largest being a sirenia. The museum was the largest collection in the Nordic countries at that time, it also received some international recognition. In 1793, Adolf Ulric became a member, and \"preses\" in 1795, of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for his work with the museum. In 1828, the collection was donated to the Academy by the Grill family. As a tribute to him, the giant oarfish (\"Gymnetrus Grillii\"), was named after him.\n\nAdolf Ulric paid for the building of a church in Söderfors that was inaugurated on 30September 1792. Three years later, at a time of crop failure and famine in Söderfors, he started the construction of an English garden at the manor to provide jobs for the farmers in Söderfors and the neighboring Hedesunda \"socken\". As a result, the park, a main feature in Söderfors, is sometimes called the \"Hedesunda brödkaka\" (the Hedesunda bread biscuit). Since 1998, the park has been included in the listed buildings of Söderfors.\n\nAdolf Ulric was known as a music lover and amateur composer. Wherever he lived, he organized well attended concert nights, with musicians invited from Stockholm. In 1772, he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.\n\nThese are some of the estates and factories owned by members of the Grill family or by the Grill Trading House during the 18th and 19th century.\n\nThe Grill House at Stortorget 3 in Gamla stan, Stockholm was built during the Middle Ages and thoroughly converted in 1649. Although subsequently remodeled in 1750 and 1914, the large molded baroque gable and some of the painted joists date to the 17th century conversion. The classic lesene of the facade and some of the interior are from the mid 18th century. It acquired its name in the 17th century when the house was purchased by Anthoni Grill (II). The Grill family owned the house for more than two hundred years and , it houses the \"Stockholms Stadsmission\" (The Stockholm City Mission).\n\nThe Grill family (possibly Claes Grill (I)) started to build the Grill manor in central Uppsala after the great fire in 1766. At the time, the family owned ironworks at Söderfors and Österby in Uppland, as well as at Iggesund in Hälsingland. The estate was completed in 1770. The Grill family owned the manor until 1790. It is the only preserved town manor in Uppsala. , it houses apartments and offices for the Red cross and Save the Children.\nClaes Grill (I) bought the palace in 1764, and lived there until he died in 1767, after which it was passed on to his wife Anna Johanna (I), and later their daughter Anna Johanna (II). In 1783, it was bought by Princess Sophia Albertina and converted into a part of the Arvfurstens palats. it houses the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nBuilt by Claes Grill (I), the residence was designed by architect Carl Hårleman in the early 1740s. It is one of Sweden's oldest preserved country residences. Claes and his wife Anna Johanna (I), would live in Stockholm during the winter and spend the summers at Svindersvik. The residence was usually accessed by rowboat. The style of the residence is rococo, with many Chinese elements brought to Sweden by the SOIC. At the death of Claes (I), the estate was passed on to his daughter Anna Johanna (II). The house was sold in 1780, and passed through several owners, until it was bought by silk manufacturer K.A. Almgren in 1863. , the house is owned by the Nordic Museum.\nThe Grill's estate in Söderfors largely made up the entire town at that time along with the ironworks and the manor. The ironworks were founded in 1676 to make anchors. Claes Grill (I) bought the ironworks in 1748, and it stayed within the Grill family until 1907. The factory passed through several owners and is, since 1995, owned and operated by Scana Steel Söderfors AB, a company with production in Norway, Sweden and China.\n\nThe first manor was finished in 1700 then between 1749 and 1756 it was rebuilt by architect Carl Hårleman for Claes Grill (I). After his death, the manor passed to his son Adolf Ulric. He was an avid naturalist and during his redidence he filled it with art and specimens of mounted animals, minerals, fossils and plants. Adolph Ulric had a separate house built for his collection in 1786. He also started the construction of an English garden at Söderfors by the river Dalälven. Gustaf af Sillén completed the park, which is one of the main features in Söderfors. , the manor is a hotel and conference venue. On 20December 1985, most of the ironworks and the surrounding area of Söderfors, a total of 91 buildings, became listed buildings, making it one of the largest listed sites in Sweden.\nThe ironworks at Österbybruk were established by King Gustav I of Sweden with the help of German experts during the 16th century and specialised in making munitions. During the 17th century the factories were merged with Lövsta and Gimo, under the directions of Louis De Geer, making it the second largest ironworks in Sweden. Since De Geer recruited skilled iron workers from the Walloon Region of Belgium, these ironworks became known as the Walloon factories (\"Wallonbruken\"). The iron ore processed in Österby came from the Dannemora mine and was noted for its purity. Iron bars produced at these ironworks were stamped with a \"Double Bullet\" mark, which guaranteed high and consistent quality. Such iron became reputable in England, where it was used by the steel industry in Sheffield. In 1758, the ironworks was sold to the Grill Trading house, at that time owned by Claes (I) and Johan Abraham. The trading house was discontinued with the death of Johan Abraham in 1799, and the ironworks was sold to Anna Johanna (III), the wife of Adolf Ulric. The factory passed through several owners until it was closed in 1983.\n\nIn 1763, Claes (I) started construction of the mansion at Österbybruk. The mansion incorporated the two wings already built in the 1730s; the west wing which served as housing for one of the ironworks caretakers and the east wing containing a chapel. The mansion was not completed until 1780, due to the decline of the East India trade, accusations of financial misconduct against Claes and Johan Abraham and the banking crises in Amsterdam in 1763. , the manor is owned by the Bruno Liljefors Foundation. His studio in one of the buildings is preserved and is on occasion open to the public.\n\nThe ironworks at Iggesund is predated by a sawmill established by the Swedish state in 1572. The first ironworks were established in 1685, by the trader Isak Breant, . It included a blast furnace, a forge with a trip hammer and two finery forges. The iron ore came from Utö and the Dannemora mine. After the Russians burned Iggesund down in 1721, the ironworks was bought by the Grill Trading House. The Grills successfully ran and improved the factories during most of the 18th century. With the decline of the Trading House in 1800, the ironworks went through several owners until it was sold to the owners of Österbybruk at that time. During the 20th century the ironworks were, through several owners, transformed and diversified into a sawmill, pulp and paper industry, chemical plant, dairy and agricultural companies. , Iggesunds bruk is a part of Iggesund Paperboard.\n\nThe Grill's estates at the village of Godegård, the manor and the ironworks, dominated the community during the 18th century. Mining had been done in the area as early as in the Middle Ages, and by the early 17th century, an ironworks was already established at Godegård. The ironworks was bought by Louis De Geer in 1618. He improved and expanded the factories and recruited skilled Walloons iron workers to teach the Swedes how to use a finery forge. When he died, the ironworks and the first manor passed on to his son Jean De Geer. After a fire in 1719, the new manor was built. It was completed in 1725.\n\nSettling down in Sweden after his profitable journeys to China, Jean Abraham was looking for something to invest in. He started negotiations for the purchase of land, manor and factory at Godegård, at that time the largest ironworks in Östergötland, and bought them all in 1775. Jean Abraham continued the expansion of the ironworks and made significant restoration of the manor. He also built an English garden, designed by Fredrik Magnus Piper, with several gazebos in a Chinese style. The ironworks was closed in 1896, but the manor remained in the Grill family until 1980. It became a listed building in 1977. Jean Abraham collected all of his letters, accounts and notes in an archive at Godegård, now known as the Godegård Archive. , the archive, containing over 7,000 document, is in the Nordic Museum. It has been digitized and is available on line as result of a request from the Macau Historical Archives in 2003.\n\nThe Trehörnings blast furnace in Mariedamm was originally built by local miners in 1636. Louis De Geer bought it in 1648, and it became part of the Godegårds ironworks which was sold on to Jean Abraham in 1775. The blast furnace remained a part of the Grill's estate at Godegård until 1888, when it was sold to the Skyllbergs bruk. The blast furnace was in operation until 1889. Since 1923, it is in being cared for and renovated by the Lerbäck Heritage society. At the beginning of the 19th century, a mansion was built in Mariedamm by the Grill family. The mansion was demolished in the 1920s, only one of the wings remain.\n\nThe mining at Garphyttan was started during the Middle Ages by German miners. These were called \"garps\", a medieval Swedish word meaning \"loudmouths\" or \"braggers\". The main product was lead ore which also contained silver, but the yield from the ore was small and business faltered a number of times during the 17th century and early 18th century. It was not until the factory was bought by three Dutch merchants in 1661, that the company started to flourish again. A trip hammer, two hearths, a smithy, a saw mill, a silver refinery and housing for the workers were added. The factories and the ironworks went through several owners until 1773, when Abraham (III) acquired them all. The previous owner had borrowed money from the Anthony Grill & Sons Trading House in Amsterdam, and when he failed to repay the loan, the factories became the property of the Grills. The building of a manor at Garphyttan started during the 17th century, and several additions were made in the middle of the 18th century. The main building of the manor was destroyed during a fire in 1830, only the four wings remain.\n\nStora Nyckelviken manor was completed in 1746 by Herman Petersen, a wealthy merchant and director of the SOIC. The manor was designed in much the same style as the other manors built with the profits from the East India trade. It consists of a main building, wings, gazebos and a park. The manor was only owned by the Grill family for a short period of time. Jean Abraham Grill bought it in 1760, and sold it 20 years later. the manor is owned by the municipality of Nacka. It houses a restaurant and a conference venue.\n\nThe first ironworks in Skebo was built in the 15th century. The iron ore was mined locally in the forests surrounding the factory. The first smithy with a trip hammer at Skebo, was constructed by Hindrich Lemmens in 1626. The iron from the ironworks was mainly sold to the Norrtälje rifle factory, which made weapons used in the Thirty Years' War. During the 18th century the Skebo and Ortala (a similar mine and factory nearby) ironworks were operated jointly. They went through several owners, due to the economical entanglements and financial difficulties of the directors and investors. One of these affairs resulted in Jacob Grill obtaining Skebo and Ortala, along with three other factories in 1769, from the previous owner who could not pay his debt to Jacob. Jacob had no experience in operating an ironworks, he got into financial difficulties and had to sell the factories in 1782. The ironworks flourished during the 19th century, and began to decline after 1900, ending in bankruptcy in 1924.\n\nDuring his time at Skebo, Jacob built a manor in 1767–1770. During the 19th century the new owners filled it with art and sculptures and it became a center for the local socialite. When the ironworks folded the manor became a retirement home for elderly gentlemen, a spa, a house for seminars and workshops, and in 2010, a noted restaurant listed in the White Guide 2012. , the restaurant is closed and the manor is a temporary lodging for refugees seeking asylum in Sweden.\nThe Lövåsen lead and silver factory in Stora Skedvi was one of the first factories to be connected with the Grill family. The Swedish government handed over the administration of the factory to Anthoni Grill (I) in 1656, to be used as a laboratory and workshop by him. He had claimed that he was in possession of a secret \"matter\" that would enable him to extract much more copper, lead, silver and gold from the ore than by other conventional methods. He experimented fore some years at the laboratory, but he never improved the extraction process, and was consequently demoted from his position at the mine. , there are no visible remains of the mine or the factory.\n\nErsta is one of the many \"malmgårdarna\" (suburban manors) built in Stockholm during the 17th and 18th century. At these manors, wealthy, noble families from different parts of Sweden, could enjoy the same comforts as in their homes in the country. The manors were built in the suburbs, close to what constituted Stockholm in the 17th century and 18th century. The city has grown considerably since then, and these locations are now considered to be part of central Stockholm. Many of the buildings, the entire manor or part of them, are still in use and embedded in the modern cityscape.\n\nErsta, on the high cliffs of southern Stockholm, was probably built in the 1670s by brännvin manufacturer Oluf Håkansson. At that time the land in that area was cheap since it was close to the old gallows. When the gallows was moved further away from town to make way for a new shipyard, the Stora Stads wharf, where ships for the SOIC were built, the area around Ersta became sought after and was called \"a garden\". The mansion passed through several owners until Jean Abraham Grill bought it in 1755. In 1770, he established a crucible steel factory at Ersta with the help of Bengt Andersson Qvist, a member of the Swedish Board of Mines. Members of the Qvist family were inspectors at the Iggesund ironworks. The steel was of good quality, but nevertheless unprofitable. In 1775, Jean Abraham sold the manor and the steel factory to Qvist who ran the company until it folded with his death in 1799. , only two of the buildings at the manor remain. They are a part of the Ersta Hospital and one of them houses the Ersta museum.\n\n"}

Herlin\n\nHeikki Hugo Herlin (7 February 1901 — 21 August 1989) was a Finnish engineer, industrialist and vuorineuvos.\n\nHerlin gained experience by studying and working abroad, before he inherited his father's position as manager of the lift producer Kone Oy in 1932. He developed the company substantially and started exports already in the 1930s. After Kone had participated at delivering large number of units to Soviet Union as part of the Finnish war reparations, Herlin established fruitful business relations with the Soviet Union. Herlin had broad language skills which he utilised when he developed Kone an international company. In 1964 he gave the leadership to his son Pekka Herlin, continuing still as a board member.\n\nHerlin was member of many company boards as wells as non-profit associations. He founded the Kone Foundation which supports cultural and sociological research.\n\nHerlin's parents were engineer Harald Herlin and Minna née Westerlund. Harald Herlin was a water piping specialist and he managed plumbing company \"Oy Vesijohtoliike Ab\" until 1920. He also worked as consultant, and at the early 1920s he was assigned to reorganise electromechanical company Ab Gottfr. Strömberg Oy. Subsequently, he bought the company's lift business in 1924. The company, Kone Oy, run small-scale licensed production.\n\nHerlin studied in Helsinki Finnish Coeducational School and passed his matriculation exam in 1919. He went to study mechanical engineering in Helsinki University of Technology and graduated in 1924. During 1925–1926 Herlin worked for AG Brown Boveri & Cie in Mannheim, Germany. In 1926 he returned to Finland for a short time to work as draftsman for Gottfr. Strömberg, but left already in 1927 to continue his studies in Columbia University, United States. At the same time he worked as draughtsman for some American engineering companies. When Herlin returned to Finland in 1928, he initially worked as a designer for Kone, his father's company. During 1929–1932 Herlin worked as technical manager in Kone- ja Siltarakennus to managing separator production.\n\nIn 1932 Herlin followed his father as manager of Kone. The production in the Helsinki-located factory had grown steadily during Harald Herlin's leadership, but now the company started to develop rapid. The product quality was improved to meet an international standard and productivity was improved. Finland was in an economical upswing after the 1930s recession was overcome, and number of new buildings, equipped with Kone lifts, were constructed. Also exports started in the same time. Prior to the Winter War, the company employed 300–400 people and the annual production reached 250 lifts. Herlin became an influential representative of the Finnish engineering industry during the war years.\n\nAfter the Continuation War between Finland and Soviet Union ended to Moscow Armistice, Finland had to pay large war reparations to Soviet Union. This included a number of Kone lifts and cranes. When the war reparations were finally paid off in the early 1950s, Herlin continued the export within normal trade agreements. At the turn of the 1960s, Kone was one of the ten biggest companies of Finland employing 2 000 people.\n\nHeikki H. Herlin led Kone until 1964 after which he was followed by his son Pekka Herlin, but continued as board member until 1987.\n\nHerlin's early international experience effected on his career as Kone manager. He put focus on product development and was open-minded at extending the market area. His contribution on war reparation industry was significant; he also saw the potential of the Soviet market already in the 1940s.\n\nWhile Herlin had strong background and expertise in engineering industry, he had broad knowledge in other areas as well. He took part in organisational activities, such as Rotary Club and voluntary national defence. Herlin was founding member of the Finnish branch of the European Cultural Foundation. He also founded the Kone Foundation, that supports cultural and sociological research; one notable support project was publishing of genealogy book Genealogia Sursilliana.\n\nHeikki H. Herlin had a broad language knowledge, which he developed continuously. While he could communicate in every language which were most important for his business, he also studied exotic languages; for him it was a matter of honour to be able to give at least a vote of thanks in the local language, wherever he visited representing either his company or Finnish trade and industry delegations.\n\nHeikki H. Herlin lived in the Thorsvik Estate, which his father had bought. He met there his future wife Anna Oittinen at the turn of the 1930s; she had come there as a nurse to take care of his mother Hanna Herlin. During 1931–1936 the couple got three daughters and one son, Pekka Herlin, who inherited his father's position as Kone leader.\n\n\n"}

The officers of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service serve in an audit managerial capacity, in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department. IA&AS is responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State governments and public sector organizations, and for maintaining the accounts of State governments. Its role is somewhat similar to the US GAO and National Audit Office (United Kingdom).\n\nThe service can be divided into officers looking after accounting and audit issues pertaining to the Union government and the State governments, and those manning the department's headquarters. The state accounts and audit offices are headed by Accountants General or Principal Accountants General. They are functionally equivalent; only the designations vary. Major states have three Principal Accountants General (PAsG) or Accountants General (AsG), each heading Accounts and Entitlement (i.e., compiling state accounts, maintaining pension accounts, loan accounts, etc.), General and Social Sector Audit (GSSA) or Economic and Revenue Sector Audit (ERSA).\n\nThe equivalent officers at the Central level are Principal Directors (PDs) or Directors General (DsG). The PDs, DsG, AsG and PAsG report to Additional Deputy CAG (also called ADAI, for historical reasons) or Deputy CAG (called DAI, again for historical reasons). The Deputy CAGs are the highest-ranked officers in the service.\n\nAfter training, the Officer Trainees are posted as Assistant Accountant General Assistant Directors a Junior Grade Group A later promoted to Deputy Accountants General (DAsG) or Deputy Directors (DDs) a Senior time scale. Subsequent to their promotion, they become Senior Deputy Accountants General (Sr.DAsG) or Directors. All officers below the rank of AG/PD are also called Group Officers as they are generally in charge of a group in the office.\n\nRecruitment to the IA&AS is through the joint competitive examinations (the Union Public Service Commission) and through promotion from the subordinate cadre. Once recruited to the IA&AS, the directly recruited officers are trained mainly at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India. The training is split into two phases. Phase-1 involves giving a theoretical background to the students on concepts of Government and commercial auditing and accounting. Phase-2 gives emphasis on practical training. The training involves modules where Officer Trainees are attached to the Reserve Bank of India,TISS-Mumbai,SEBI the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, NIFM Faridabad, the Bureau of Parliamentary Studies and the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

The International Labour Organization and the World Trade Organization have been the main international bodies involved in reform labour markets. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have indirectly driven changes in labour policy by demanding structural adjustment conditions for receiving loans or grants. Conflict of laws issues arise, determined by national courts, when people work in more than one country, and supra-national bodies, particularly in the law of the European Union, has a growing body of rules regarding labour rights.\n\nInternational labour standards refer to conventions agreed upon by international actors, resulting from a series of value judgments, set forth to protect basic worker rights, enhance workers’ job security, and improve their terms of employment on a global scale. The intent of such standards, then, is to establish a worldwide minimum level of protection from inhumane labour practices through the adoption and implementation of said measures. From a theoretical standpoint, it has been maintained, on ethical grounds, that there are certain basic human rights that are universal to humankind. Thus, it is the aim of international labour standards to ensure the provision of such rights in the workplace, such as against workplace aggression, bullying, discrimination and gender inequality on the other hands for working diversity, workplace democracy and empowerment.\n\nWhile the existence of international labour standards does not necessarily imply implementation or enforcement mechanisms, most real world cases have utilised formal treaties and agreements stemming from international institutions. The primary international agency charged with developing working standards is the International Labour Organization (ILO). Established in 1919, the ILO advocates international standards as essential for the eradication of labour conditions involving \"injustice, hardship and privation\". According to the ILO, international labour standards contribute to the possibility of lasting peace, help to mitigate potentially adverse effects of international market competition and help the progress of international development.\n\nImplementation, however, is not limited to the ILO nor is it constrained to the legislative model that the ILO represents. Other alternatives include direct trade sanctions, multilateral enforcement, and voluntary standards. In addition to controversies that arise over each of these models, greater issues have also been raised concerning the debate over the need for international labour standards themselves. However, while critics have arisen, the international community has largely come to a consensus in favour of basic protection of the world’s labour force from inhumane practices.\n\nAssociated with the development of successful international labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement of labour standards. Most monitoring occurs through the ILO, but domestic agencies and other NGOs also play a role in the successful monitoring of international labour standards.\n\nSince the industrial revolution the labour movement has been concerned how economic globalisation would weaken the bargaining power of workers, as their employers could move to hire workers abroad without the protection of the labour standards at home. In the Fourth Annual International Congress in 1869, the following was resolved:\n\nThe concept of protecting workers from the perils of labour environments dates all the way back to 14th-century Europe. The first example of the modern labor rights movement, though, came in response to the brutal working conditions that accompanied the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1802, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed what is now known as the English Factory Act. The act sought to regulate the workday of apprentices by restricting work hours to 12 per day. In doing so, the English Factory Act served as a precursor to the models of international labour standards seen today. Minimal regulations similar to those found in English legislation subsequently became increasingly commonplace among 19th century industrialising nations. Early attempts at the provision of labour standards were limited in scope, though. Such conventions focused primarily on improving working conditions in relation to hours of work, women's and children's labour, and the use of hazardous materials. While it was evident that support for workers’ rights was inconsistent across international boundaries, activists originally only employed the use of moral suasion to deal with differences in labour standards. It was not until the latter parts of the 19th century that efforts were made to implement uniform standards on an international scale.\n\nIn 1919, following the end of the First World War, the agenda on international labour standards reached a new level of prominence as a result of the founding of the International Labour Organization. As mandated by Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles, the ILO was created as a branch of the League of Nations in order to address all conceivable aspects of labour rights. Preliminary efforts focused primarily on the eradication of slavery and all forms of forced labour. The agenda quickly expanded, however, to include the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, non-discrimination in employment, and the elimination of child labour. The ILO’s creation marked the first instance of multiple major international actors coming together in an attempt to reach a consensus on universal workers’ rights. Despite a lack of any formal means of coercion, the ILO then urged its 44 original member countries to adopt and ratify conventions limiting oppressive labour market practices.\n\nIn the first two years of the ILO’s existence, 22 international labour conventions were adopted. Some of the topics that the first conventions addressed were “hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, night work for women, minimum age, and night work for young persons in industry.” In 1930, the ILO adopted the first future fundamental convention: the Forced Labour Convention (No.29), which prohibited all forms of forced labour unless exempted by certain conditions.\nWith the onset of the Great Depression, the United States joined the ILO in 1934 noting that complex labour issues would require an international response. Throughout the history of the League of Nations, the ILO is the only League-affiliated organisation that the United States joined. With the backdrop of World War 2, the ILO broadened its mandate with the Declaration of Philadelphia, signed during the 26th general conference session in 1944. The Declaration of Philadelphia, which is attached to the general constitution of the ILO, foreshadows some of the ILO’s earliest future fundamental conventions including the freedom of expression and association which was adopted in 1948 as Convention 87, Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, global divisions of labour were shaped largely by the practices of colonialism. Poorer countries exported natural resources to richer countries, which then manufactured and produced specialised goods. As many colonised nations achieved independence, developing nations in the global South took on increasingly protectionist policies in attempts to build up the manufacturing sectors of their economies, thus marking a shift in the global division of labour. However, towards the latter part of the 20th century, a number of factors saw protectionist measures fall. Such factors included rising labour costs in the north, advances in transportation and communication technologies, the liberalisation of trade, and the deregulation of markets. In the midst of a changing international labour landscape, developing nations in the south took on a previously unseen domination of the labour-intensive manufacturing industry.\n\nWith the deregulation of major markets and significant increases in the volume of international trade, attempts to make manufacturing sectors more attractive to retailers saw extreme downward pressure placed on the quality of working conditions in lower income regions of the world. This gave rise to growing concerns about a global Race to the bottom, in which governments take part in the iterative loosening of labour protections in attempts to aid the international competitiveness of export-oriented industries. Fears of this nature consequently produced the notable increases in the discourse on international labour ethics that characterise the contemporary international human rights arena.\n\nThe traditional model of labour standards regulation has been, for most of history, within-country or within-jurisdiction legislation and enforcement. However, this model may not be appropriate when competitors in a product market are located in different countries or jurisdictions with dissimilar labour standards. This concern opens up the discussion for the establishment of international labour standards, which, in turn, require international regulation, particularly in the context of global trade. However, determining an effective method of implementation of international labor standards has been an area of difficulty and an area that is highly contested. The following sections outline several existing models for the regulation of international labour standards based largely on work by Richard N. Block, Karen Roberts, Cynthia Ozeki and Myron J. Roomkin in their paper titled \"Models of International Labour Standards\".\n\nThe legislative model for implementing a set of international labour standards is the best known. This model involves the enactment and enforcement of labour standards by a legislative body across a union of countries. Social policies regarding employment and labour typically fall into three areas: free movement of labour, prevention of social dumping via low labour standards, and dialogue between labour and management. This model has been adopted by the European Community, part of the European Union, and is also the model taken by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Organisations, such as these, are given the authority, through a series of procedures, to then issue directives in any of these areas of labour policy. Member states must comply with these directives; however, what compliance actually means and entails is left to the discretion of each member state.\n\nFor over 25 years, there have been links between labour standards and international trade, particularly for specific commodities. The earliest and broadest-based example of linking international labour standards with trade is found in U.S. legislation under the Trade Act of 1974, creating the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Under the GSP, the United States was allowed to grant nonreciprocal tariff preference to less developed countries, based on certain country and product eligibility criteria, in order to promote their economic growth and development. Among the country eligibility criteria is affording workers in a country certain internationally recognized rights, similar to the four core conventions established by the ILO. If a complaint or petition was filed against a GSP beneficiary, these are processed through the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Since 1988, eight countries have been suspended or terminated from the GSP program: Burma, Liberia, Maldives, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Pakistan (several products), Sudan and Syria. Four countries have been suspended but subsequently reinstated: Central African Republic, Chile, Paraguay, and Romania. Additionally, Section 2202 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 requires that the Secretary of State submit to Congress an annual report on the economic policy and trade practices of each country with which the United States has an economic or trade relationship.\n\nThe trade sanctions model in the United States, also working as an incentives approach of sorts, appears to have been successful in forcing U.S. officials to encourage countries that are the subject of complaints to address severe violations of labour standards, as defined in the legislation. This model, however, is not designed to be a broad-based guarantee of labour standards among trading partners because it is based on external complaints not the results of monitoring. While it is effective in providing procedural rights, a lower percentage of trading partners provide substantive standards, so this measure has had mixed success. Some hope that implementation in competitor developing countries along with support by complementary domestic policies would allow this model to overall, raise the global social floor.\n\nAnother example of the various methods of implementation of international labour standards is the multilateral enforcement model. The model, embodied in the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), is different from other compulsory methods in that it opposes any imposition of common standards schemes. Instead, the multilateral enforcement model requires that signatories to agreements like the NAALC make firm commitments to existing labor standard structures within their respective domestic spheres. The unique aspect of the NAALC, however, is that it does not in any way dictate policy. This includes a strong aversion to uniformly adopted standards on the international level. Rather than encouraging the inclusion of a baseline set of workers’ rights, the multilateral enforcement model merely requires that its members strive to create unbiased administrative bodies that judge whether or not appropriate measures are being taken to ensure the continued support of domestic labour standards. In this manner, the multilateral model is not international in its adoption of a common set of principles, but rather in its level of required commitment to an unspecified group of standards. In enforcing such commitments, agreements like the NAALC primarily utilize recommendations and publicity to make decision makers accountable for their actions. Multilateral enforcement models like the NAALC have experienced mixed results in terms of effectiveness due to their limited powers of influence.\n\nThe voluntary standards model makes reference to a system of implementation for labour standards based on a corporate code of conduct. Corporate codes of conduct are adopted when various organizations join together in agreement to operate under a set of socially responsible labour rules. Therefore, this model generally involves voluntary behaviour and self-regulation. An example of voluntary corporate adoption of labour standards is given by the Sullivan Principles in South Africa that were taken on by a group of U.S. companies. Additionally, U.S. apparel retailers, such as Nike, the Gap, and Liz Claiborne, have recently attempted to put in place a system of regulations to prevent their products from being produced under sweatshop conditions.\n\nFor this model to be successful, there must be incentive for compliance. The problem, however, is that in the case of labour standards, there are usually high economic incentives to disregard these standards, which are viewed as rises in production costs. For this reason, the monitoring system plays a crucial role in the success and effectiveness of such conditions. In some cases, like the aforementioned Sullivan Principles in South Africa, monitoring has demonstrated the codes’ success. In this case, investors rewarded adherence to the code, as a sign of corporate citizenship. On the other hand, consumers can also punish firms they see as socially irresponsible by means of boycotts or the individual decision to avoid purchase of certain products. The main point of these examples being: where there is strong pressure from investors and consumers to support certain standards, companies may benefit by being seen as upholding accepted morals.\n\nNow, while this is true, it is also true that where costs of complying with stringent standards are high and the sources of consumer pressure diffused, codes are likely to be ineffective. It takes the active involvement and interest of the company, in response to whatever actions have been taken, for this model to be successful. When they choose to respond to outside pressures, companies use means such as public announcements, local religious leaders, human rights activists, university professors, and labor representatives, among others, to implement compliance and a system of monitoring. Another difficulty has been that, while pressure has been effectively pressed on individual firms, it has been difficult to find agreement at an industry level, in terms of corporate codes.\n\nFinally, a variation of the voluntary standards models is one of certification, which began in October 1997 with the issuance of SA (Social Accountability) 8000 by the Council on Economic Priorities Accrediting Agency (CEPAA). SA8000 is an example of a corporate certification process for social responsibility and labor standards. This certification process has the purpose of identifying corporations that comply with certain criteria based on social accountability requirements, including criteria for child labor and worker health and safety. The resulting certification then serves the purpose of assuring customers that goods and services provided by certified firms have been produced by workers who are offered labour standards that meet at least a minimally acceptable level.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) is a specialised agency of the United Nations, consisting of 187 member countries, that deals with labour issues. Following World War I, the Treaty of Versailles contained the first constitution of a new International Labour Organization founded on the principle that \"labour is not a commodity\", and for the reason that \"peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice\". The primary role of the ILO has been to coordinate principles of international labour law by issuing Conventions, which codify labour laws on all matters. Members of the ILO can voluntarily adopt and ratify the conventions by enacting the rules in their domestic law. For instance, the first Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919 requires a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members states, although the Working Time Directive adopts its principles, subject to the individual opt-out. The present constitution of the ILO comes from the Declaration of Philadelphia 1944, and under the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work 1998 classified eight conventions as core. Together these require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions Nos 87 and 98) abolition of forced labour (29 and 105) abolition labour by children before the end of compulsory school (138 and 182) and no discrimination at work (Nos 100 and 111). Compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory from the fact of membership, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states' progress, so that publicity will put public and international pressure to reform the laws. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or perhaps less frequent basis.\n\nThe ILO, by its existence, is the recognised international vehicle for raising international labour standards issues in a worldwide forum. No other model in existence is capable of performing this role. This organisation establishes labour standards by means of both conventions and recommendations and has a tripartite governing structure – representing government, employers and workers. While ILO recommendations take more of the role of providing mere guidance to member states, the stronger form, ILO conventions, have the status of a treaty, which, in principle, is binding on the member countries that voluntarily ratify them. These represent benchmarks of strong labour standards towards which countries can strive by promulgating and enforcing national laws that comply with the conventions. It is through these means that the organisation works to enforce international labour standards.\n\nIn 1998, the ILO International Labour Conference adopted the “Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work” defining certain rights as “fundamental.” The Declaration commits member states to respect and promote these main principles, referred to as the core conventions, which are grouped into the following four categories (total of eight ILO conventions): freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. The Declaration claims these rights to be universal, applying to all people in all States – regardless of level of economic development. The International Labour Conference regards these principles as so important that all member counties are obligated to comply with them, regardless of ratification status.\n\nAlongside the fundamental conventions, the ILO has also identified four priority conventions or governance conventions. Crucial to the running of the international labour standards systems implemented by the ILO, the ILO recommends that member states ratify the following priority conventions: the Labour Inspection Convention (1947), the Labour Inspection (Agriculture) Convention (1969), the Triparte Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention (1976), and the Employment Policy Convention (1964).\n\nIssues with the ILO’s approach to implementing international labour standards come down to a question of universality amongst the conventions and member countries, with some arguing that flexibility is necessary to meet the needs of developing countries. These concerns gather around the idea that the race to expand exports or attract foreign investment can cause competition on the basis of labour costs, leading to a decline in international labour standards as governments either dismantle national laws that protect workers or weaken the enforcement of these laws. The underlying issue here is the connection between national incomes and the standards a country can feasibly support while remaining competitive. Other issues involve enforcement of these standards following ratification. The ILO provides a vehicle for investigating cases of noncompliance through representations, filed by employer or worker organisations, or complaints, lodged by another member that also ratified the convention. These are then sent to a committee that launches an investigation and report. This is followed by either acceptance of recommendations on steps the government may take to address the complaint or the request to submit the case to the International Court of Justice. Failure to comply may result in an incurred sanction from the organization. \n\nOverall, the ILO structure essentially created a system of voluntary compliance with labor standards based on ratification of the established conventions. In general the enforcement system of representation and complaints has been successful – success being measured by the fact that only one representation or complaint has reached the most severe sanction. On the other hand, due to the absence of strong sanctions, the ILO lacks a strong enough deterrent factor for countries inclined to violate the standards the ILO upholds. Further, the “flexibility” of standards allows too much leeway for adaptation based on independent circumstances, diminishing the force of the conventions.\n\nBecause the ILOs enforcement and sanction mechanisms are weak, there has been significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organization's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157-member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effective a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach have called for a \"social clause\" to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that \"the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question.\" Accordingly, it is argued that countries ought to be able to take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. Similarly it is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice depends mostly on productivity of workers. The view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, in the context of weaker bargaining power and mobility for workers, still allows for business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.\n\nWhile the debate over labour standards applied by the ILO and the WTO seeks to balance standards with free movement of capital globally, conflicts of laws (or private international law) issues arise where workers move from home to go abroad. If a worker from America performs part of her job in Brazil, China and Denmark (a \"peripatetic\" worker) or if a worker is engaged in Ecuador to work as an expatriate abroad in France, an employer may seek to characterise the contract of employment as being governed by the law of the country where labour rights are least favourable to the worker, or seek to argue that the most favourable system of labour rights does not apply. For example, in a UK labour law case, \"Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd\" Mr Ravat was from the UK but was employed in Libya by a German company that was part of the American multinational oil conglomerate, Halliburton. He was dismissed by a supervisor based in Egypt. He was told he would be hired under UK law terms and conditions, and this was arranged by a staffing department in Aberdeen. Under the UK Employment Rights Act 1996 he would have a right to unfair dismissal, but the Act left open what the territorial scope of the statute was. The UK Supreme Court held that the principle would be that for an expatriate worker, although the general rule is that they will not have UK labour law rights, there would be an exception if the worker could show a \"close connection\" to the UK, and this was established through the contractual assurances given to Mr Rabat.\n\nThis fits within the general framework in the EU. Under the EU Rome I Regulation article 8, workers will have employment rights of the country where they habitually work. But exceptionally they may have a claim in another country if they can establish a close connection to it. The Regulation emphasises that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.\n\nIt is also necessary that a court has jurisdiction to hear a claim. Under the Brussels I Regulation article 19, this requires the worker habitually works in the place where the claim is brought, or is engaged there.\n\nThe European Community (EC) is a multigovernmental legislative structure that, through the Treaty of European Union (Maastricht) in 1992, the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, and various other agreements has promoted full economic integration of its member states. While it has issued a number of directives in non-labour areas, the same cannot be said for matters concerning social policy and labour. However, some restrictions regarding health and safety have been adopted by the EC in an attempt to mitigate any inhumane practices, involving low health and safety standards, used for the sake of a competitive advantage.\n\nThe European Union, unlike most international organisations, has an extensive system of labour laws, but officially excluding (according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) matters around direct wage regulation (e.g. setting a minimum wage), fairness of dismissals (e.g. a requirement for elected workers to approve dismissals) and collective bargaining. A series of Directives regulate almost all other issues, for instance the Working Time Directive guarantees 28 days of paid holiday, the Equality Framework Directive prohibits all forms of discrimination for people performing work, and the Collective Redundancies Directive requires that proper notice is given and consultation takes place before any decisions about economic dismissals are finalised.\n\nHowever, the European Court of Justice has recently expanded upon the Treaties through its case law. As well as having legal protection for workers rights, an objective of trade unions has been to organise their members across borders in the same way that multinational corporations have organised their production globally. In order to meet the balance of power that comes from ability of businesses to dismiss workers or relocate, unions have sought to take collective action and strikes internationally. However, this kind of coordination was recently challenged in the European Union in two controversial decisions. In \"Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union\" a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden on low pay. The local Swedish Union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective agreement. Under the Posted Workers Directive, article 3 lays down minimum standards for workers being posted away from home so that workers always receive at least the minimum rights that they would have at home in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) goes on to say that this \"shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers\". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g. in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement. However, in an interpretation seen as astonishing by many, the ECJ said that only the posting state could raise standards beyond its minimum for posted workers, and any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would be an infringement of the business' freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the Rome I Regulation, which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in \"The Rosella\", the ECJ also held that a blockade by the International Transport Workers Federation against a business that was using an Estonian flag of convenience (i.e. saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under TFEU article 49. The ECJ said that it recognised the workers' \"right to strike\" in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment. The result is that the European Court of Justice's recent decisions create a significant imbalance between the international freedom of business, and that of labour, to bargain and take action to defend their interests.\n\nFor those members within the EC who favour the implementation of labour standards, there has been a push to ease the decision-making barriers to social legislation. On 7 February, 1992, the signing of the Maastricht Treaty made it easier to pass legislation on less controversial issues, such as health and safety, nondiscrimination, and consultation with workers.\n\nWhile the EC provides a structure for enacting legislation that applies across counties, the extent to which it can actually create international labour standards, even within its own confines, is limited. While these directives allow for labour concerns to be brought above the national level, the presence of philosophical differences among member states as well as constraints on state autonomy demonstrate barriers to this model. However, despite these difficulties and a complex decision-making structure designed to include consultation with the governments of all member states, the various EC policy-making institutions and the related parties have succeeded in creating cross-national legislation for labour standards under its social policy umbrella. Consequently, this model, as demonstrated by the EC, is a viable one for establishing labour standards on a cross-national basis. The difficulty lies in the duplication of this model elsewhere, due to the EC’s unique, integrated community that is the only such general multinational standard system in the world today.\n\nA crucial element to the success of international labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement. When monitoring international labor standards, agencies rely on three major types of information: information from international organisations, like the ILO, information from national agencies, and information from non-governmental organizations. Upon locating and determining the necessary data, monitoring agencies then need to process and sift through the results to analyze compliance with certain international labor standards. Finally after compliance analysis, recommendations and required adjustments are then communicated to the concerned party.\n\nOne of the major sources of data necessary for the monitoring of international labour standards is the International Labour Organization. According to Article 22 of the ILO Constitution, “each of the members agrees to make an annual report to the International Labour Office on the measures which it has taken to give effect to the provisions of Conventions to which it is a party.” Specifically, countries are mandated to prepare a report every two years for the Core Labour Standards of the ILO and every five years for all other active conventions that the country has ratified, which are submitted, to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards. For conventions that have not yet been ratified by the country, Article 19 of the ILO Constitution mandates countries to demonstrate on regular intervals steps “they have taken to give effect to any provision of certain conventions or recommendations, and to indicate any obstacles which have prevented or delayed the ratification of a particular convention.” All of the above combine to form the ILO’s regular system of supervision.\n\nThe ILO also has a special procedures type of supervisory mechanism where complaints levelled against member states and freedom of association complaints are dealt with. Under articles 24 and 26 of the ILO Constitution, different groups of people may indicate to the governing body that a certain state is not complying with an international labor standard that they have previously ratified. Within the ILO framework, the labor standard regarding the freedom to associate has also received a special priority which allows complaints to be brought up to the governing body even if the state has not ratified the conventions regarding the freedom of association.\n\nOther international organisations like the United Nations and the World Bank also monitor international labour standards. The United Nations largely relies on self-reported data from member states. These data points are used to determine whether or not member states are meeting the requirements of international treaties agreed to by the United Nations. Given that the ILO is a subset of the UN, generally, more detailed labour standards data and compliance records are located within the realm of the ILO. The World Bank incorporates the international standards set by the ILO as one of the factors behind assistance to member states.\n\nNational agencies and NGOs also monitor international labour standards. National agencies generally report on domestic compliance of international labour standards while NGOs are much more diverse in their scope.\n\nSeveral challenges, however, exist in the monitoring of international labour standards. The ILO and other international organisations generally rely on self-reporting data from countries. Some analysts have questioned the quality and neutrality of these sources of data. For example, definitions of what constitutes unemployment vary from country to country making it difficult to compare data and to judge data quality. Additionally, despite the large amount of data, there are still gaps in their coverage. Coverage is greatest in the urban environments and the formal sector. Conversely, gaps exist in the coverage of rural environments and informal sectors which can positively skew the labour statistics that countries report.\n\nChallenges also exist in the usage of data to assess compliance with various international labour standards. As interest continues to grow in the monitoring and enforcement of international labour standards, an assessment, according to the National Research Council, “requires careful analysis of what the core labor standards mean and imply, how to determine when a country is or is not in compliance, what indicators of compliance and which sources of information to use, and limitations of the sources of information.” Standardisation will be necessary to allow proper and effective monitoring of labor standards.\n\nWorkplace discrimination, overt and covert, is an example of violations of international labour standards. The ILO defines workplace discrimination as “treating people differently because of certain characteristics, such as race, colour, or sex, which results in the impairment of equality and of opportunity and treatment.” An overt example of workplace discrimination is unequal pay, especially between men and women. Though recognized as an example of workplace discrimination since 1919, the gender pay gap, often a measurement of unequal pay, is estimated to be 22.9%, which means that for every dollar earned by a man, a woman, in the same position would earn 77.1 cents. Despite the fact that the ILO proposes that there are many benefits to reducing and eliminating the gender pay gap, at the current, slow rates of gender pay reduction, the ILO estimates that “another 75 years will be needed to bridge this gap.”\n\nJob security is another arena where workplace discrimination can be found. In some developing countries, like Bangladesh, job insecurity reflects patriarchal societies that have diminished women’s options. Currently in Bangladesh, of the 1.8 million workers in garment factories, 1.5 million are women. From the perspective of the factory owners, the advantage of hiring woman is the “docility that comes with disadvantage.” Women have fewer opportunities than men when it comes to decent, respectable employment. For many of these women, if they were to lose their jobs at the garment factories, they would be forced into poverty or work in the informal sector, like prostitution.\n\nOther forms of discrimination, outside of gender discrimination, include discrimination based on race & ethnicity, age, religion, political opinions, social origins, disabilities, sexual orientations, genetics, and lifestyle. The ILO identifies all these forms of discrimination as violations of international labor standards.\n\nAccording to the ILO, child labor is “work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.” The ILO classifies work conducted by children into three categories: children in employment, child labor, and hazardous work. The ILO condemns both child labor and hazardous work with the goal of eliminating hazardous child labor by 2016. In 2012, the ILO estimated that 168 million children (11% of the world’s children) were engaged in child labour, of which, 85 million engaged in hazardous work. ILO Convention No. 5 adopted in 1919 and entered into force in 1921 was the first ILO convention regulating child labour. Specifically, the main provision of the article stated “children under the age of fourteen years shall not be employed or work in any public or private industrial undertaking.” Since its inception in 1919, several other ILO conventions had been adopted that have modified and expanded the initial 1919 convention. Today, the C138 Minimum Age Convention, 1973 and C182 Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention 1999 have replaced all the previous conventions. The Minimum Age Convention defines the minimum age children are allowed to work. Children, unless under special allowances, are not allowed to engage in hazardous work until the age of 18. The basic minimum age for child labor is 15 (14 for developing countries), and the minimum wage for light work, which may not interfere with education or vocational orientation and training, is 13 (12 for developing countries). C182 urges all governments to take immediate action to identify and eliminate the worst forms of child labour.\nThe following are defined as hazardous work according to the ILO:\n\nThe majority of UN Member States has ratified both C138 and C182. The Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (C182) has been ratified by 177 nations, while 8 countries (Cuba, Eritrea, India, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau, Somalia, Tuvalu) have yet to ratify it. The Minimum Age Convention (C138) has been ratified by 166 countries, while 19 countries have yet to ratify it. Notably, Australia, the United States, Canada, Mexico, India, and Bangladesh, are all member states that have not ratified the Minimum Age Convention (C138).\n\nOperating under the mantra that “decent work is safe work,” the ILO Programme on Safety and Health at Work and the Environment, SafeWork, has the goal of making work safer for all. According to the ILO, someone dies from a work-related accident or disease every 15 seconds. Unsafe labour practices have a long, sordid history. From the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire to the 2013 fertilizer explosion in West, Texas, industrial disasters negatively affect the lives of workers and their dependents with high associated economic costs. Since its creation in 1919, ensuring worker safety has been one of the ILO’s fundamental missions. The ILO has over its history adopted several conventions that have the goal of maximising worker safety and health. Currently, there are three fundamental conventions that are in effect: the Occupation Safety and Health Convention (C155, 1981), the Occupational Health Services Convention (C161, 1985), and the Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Convention (C187, 2006). The most recent convention has the stated aim of “promoting a preventative safety and health culture and progressively achieving a safe and healthy working environment.” One challenge that the ILO faces is the low ratification levels of the fundamental health and safety conventions. C155, C161, and C187 have been ratified by 60, 31, and 25 nations respectively. From the perspective of the ILO failing to meet the expectations delineated in the conventions are examples of international labor standards violations.\n\nIn addition to disagreements about the appropriate method of implementation for international labour standards, there are dissenting opinions concerning the validity of their existence at all. The two most common arguments raised against international labour standards are that they undermine international competitiveness and erode domestic policy.\n\nA critique of international labour standards historically raised by right-of-centre economists is that they distort market forces, thus inhibiting employment and income. According to right-wing economists, global free trade allows countries to specialise in those activities in which they have a comparative advantage and to reap mutual gains through exchange. The international competitiveness of countries with large amounts of unskilled labour depends on their ability to provide low-cost workers. Therefore, international standards would undermine any comparative advantage by increasing the cost of labour. According to the conservative argument, international labour standards leave developing nations with a diminished export economy.\n\nSupporters of international labour standards often respond by arguing that this critique only attacks a particular aspect of enforcement rather than the standards themselves. Furthermore, left-of-centre economists suggest that higher labour standards do not necessarily undermine competitiveness. Empirical evidence provided by Berik and Rodgers (2006) suggests that any costs of raising labour standards can easily be offset by incentives encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI) and exports. Following this line of argument, not only do higher labour standards improve social and political stability, thus encouraging more foreign investment, but they also provide valuable investments in human capital that can lead to efficiency gains.\n\nAnother prominent argument against international labour standards is the notion that any attempt to harmonise set benchmarks for acceptable working conditions disregards, to some extent, the current state of an individual country’s unique economic and social climates. It is suggested that rather than adopting an internationally agreed upon group of labour standards, sovereign states are better off leaving labour market regulation to domestic policy. In this way, it is argued, a country can tailor a standard such as a minimum wage to the specific situation in that area of the world rather than trying to implement an ill-fitting uniform wage. In a 1996 study, Drusilla Brown, Alan Deardorff and Robert Stern use a variety of theoretical labour models to test the effectiveness of the harmonisation of international labour standards. The study concludes that in theoretical cases, market failures that allow a breakdown in working environment conditions are most adequately remedied by labour standards. However, market failures are not uniform across countries and so it stands to reason that labour standards should not be constructed in an international way.\n\nAn example of this critique can be seen by looking at the issue of child labour practices. The case against harmonised international labour rights makes the point that the amount of child labour in a country is directly dependent on its level of economic development. Following this line of reasoning, poorer countries have a better chance at abolishing child labour through economic development rather than minimum age requirements. In fact, one study found that children 14 years and younger are not completely withdrawn from the labour force until GDP approaches $5000 per capita. Additionally, it is also argued that international consensuses that disparage child labor practices can actually reduce the likelihood of eradicating child labour altogether by weakening incentives for adult workers to support a ban.\n\n\n"}

He had a well rounded education. He moved to New Zealand in the early 1850s and settled in Auckland where he began making bricks and also took a one third interest in a steam powered flour mill in 1856. \n\nIn 1859 he made his first visit to Matamata where he met and became friends with Wiremu Tamihana, the King Maker and met King Pōtatau during a tour of the Waikato he published in 1860. His account ended with a prophecy of the Invasion of the Waikato, saying, \"\"It is unfortunate that the remedy we propose should have an aspect of selfishness. For we say to them, and justly, 'Sell three-fourths of your lands, and cease to be nomads, if you wish to save your race from extinction.' They not unnaturally decline the prescription when the fee is apparently so large. So the matter rests for the present. Time and the natural progress of events will, nevertheless, shortly either enforce the prescription and exact the fee, or consign the refractory patients to a swift and sure destruction\".\"\n\nIn Auckland he was one of a small group of highly influential business men such as John Logan Campbell, Frederick Whitaker and Thomas Morrin. They had significant influence on The Bank of New Zealand and the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company. Firth was always able to borrow finance to capitalize his many innovative schemes.\n\nFirth briefly entered Parliament for the Auckland West electorate. He was elected in 1861, and resigned on 30 April 1862. He promoted the purchase of land directly from Maori as had happened in the Wairarapa. This contravened the Treaty of Waitangi but had been a mechanism used from time to time in localized issues when Maori agreed.\n\nIn 1865 with the establishment of peace in the Waikato, Firth was able to lease land from Wiremu Tamihana of Ngati Haua, a kingitanga tribe. Tamihana, who was a Christian, had been at the core of the Kingite movement but was at heart a man of peace. A large area of land around Matamata was leased for a rental of up to five hundred pounds a year. Two years later he bought outright some of the land covered by the lease and this became the basis of his estate at Matamata. By 1865 Firth had leased 55,000 acres.\"The fern and bracken covered plains was burnt and soon sown in grassland and feed crops such as turnips\".\n\nHe built his first homestead near Peria where Tamihana had earlier established a missionary station. When Tamihana died in 1866 Firth had a monument built at the place he died with an inscription that said it was Tamihana's will that Firth stay on the Matamata land as long as he (Firth) chose. Meanwhile, his businesses in Auckland were prospering and he was able to lease a very fine house on the eastern side of Mount Eden from John Ogilvie (1839?-1871) Secretary to the Auckland Board of Commissioners (in 1871 he would purchase the house).\n\nEarly in 1870 Josiah, or Hohaia as he was known to the Māori, was contacted by Te Kooti during his flight from Te Porere through the King Country and back to the Ureweras. From his base at Tapapa, near Tirau. Te Kooti sent a message to Firth to meet him at Wiremu Tamihana's monument. Firth claimed to have inherited Wiremu Tamihana's \"mantle of patience\". Before the meeting Firth contacted Daniel Pollen the general agent for the government in Auckland. On 17 January Firth met Te Kooti. Firth told Te Kooti he had come to listen -he had no power to offer any terms. They talked for some time with Te Kooti emphasising he would not surrender but wanted to be left in peace to live at Tapapa. Firth noted that although Te Kooti was unarmed he was backed by a semi circle of heavily armed men with modern weapons in good condition. He told Firth: \"If they let me alone I will live quietly; if not I will fight.\"\n\nThe government sent word to Firth that they had nothing to say to Te Kooti apart from if he surrendered he would be given safe conduct to Auckland. This telegram crossed with one from Firth outlining Te Kooti's wishes. But Te Kooti had aroused too much fear and hatred for his offer to be accepted, and it was rejected out of hand. There was also considerable official annoyance with Josiah Firth. The Premier Willian Fox and the government agent for Hawkes Bay J.D. Ormond were irate\"with that meddlesome sweep Firth.\"The military were instructed to attack Te Kooti whether Firth was with him or not. For Te Kooti the whole meeting may have been another ruse, as shortly afterwards Chief Te Hiri from Coromandel arrived and gave Te Kooti a huge quantity of gunpowder(7kegs) and a bag of bullets 2 feet high. In fact Te Kooti had \"predicted\" he would be given the ammunition down to the exact day and time. indicating the resupply mission had been prearranged.\n\nIn 1873 Firth began a seven-year project to clear the Waihou River of snags and obstacles to navigation thus opening the upper reaches of the Thames Estuary to shipping. He was the author of \"Our Kin across the Sea\".\n\nIn 1871 Firth purchased his Auckland residence 'Clifton' which he had previously leased, and extended the building. To the rear of the wooden Gothic house he erected a large wing in the Castellated style which included a 15 metre tall tower, completed in 1873. This structure was built in unreinforced concrete, an experimental material for the period. As well a providing a vantage point with splendid views of the Waitematā Harbour the tower contained a water tank so the up-to-date indoor plumbing had good water pressure. The tower also contained a study for Firth in which he arranged a small museum of geological items and other curiosities. In 1882 at Matamata he constructed a second castellated tower, a slightly smaller version of the Mt Eden tower and likewise an extension to an earlier wooden residence. Both structures are still standing - the Matamata Tower being a tourist attraction in its own right.\n\nFirth championed the use of concrete as a building material and significantly Firth's sons would go on to found the Firth Concrete Company. Firth's two concrete structures are now some of the earliest examples of concrete construction in the country (John Logan Campbell's 1871 house 'Loganbank' in Official Bay having been demolished). As a member of the Beresford Street Congregationalist Church in Karangahape Road, Firth influenced the choice of concrete for that building as well (1875).\n\nIn 1882 Firth arranged a grand reception in the grounds of Clifton House for the Maori King, Tawhiao. Firth had played a part in the establishment of Tawhiao's father The Waikato chief Potatau Te Wherowhero as Maori King in 1858.\n\nNew Zealand agriculture went through a serious depression during the 1880s, one which hit Firth hard, and in 1889 he was declared bankrupt. Later he began to develop a trade in pumice based on its properties of insulation and fire resistance, travelling to the United States and England. He died suddenly on 11 December 1897 just as the venture was becoming successful, and was buried at St Stephen's Cemetery in the Auckland suburb of Parnell.\n"}

In the chemical processing industry, leaching has a variety of commercial applications, including separation of metal from ore using acid, and sugar from sugar beets using hot water.\n\nAnother term for this is lixiviation, or the extraction of a soluble particle from its constituent parts.\n\nIn a typical leaching operation, the solid mixture to be separated consists of particles, inert insoluble carrier A and solute B. The solvent, C, is added to the mixture to selectively dissolve B. The overflow from the stage is free of solids and consists of only solvent C and dissolved B. The underflow consists of slurry of liquid of similar composition in the liquid overflow and solid carrier A. In an ideal leaching equilibrium stage, all the solute is dissolved by the solvent; none of the carrier is dissolved. The mass ratio of the solid to liquid in the underflow is dependent on the type of equipment used and properties of the two phases.\n\nLeaching is the process by which inorganic, organic contaminants or radionuclides are released from the solid phase into the water phase under the influence of mineral dissolution, desorption, complexation processes as affected by pH, redox, dissolved organic matter and (micro)biological activity. The process itself is universal, as any material exposed to contact with water will leach components from its surface or its interior depending on the porosity of the material considered.\n\nOne such reaction is:\n\nMany biological organic and inorganic substances occur in a mixture of different components in a solid. In order to separate the desired solute constituent or remove an undesirable solute component from the solid phase, the solid is brought into contact with a liquid. The solid and liquid are in contact, and the solute or solutes can diffuse from the solid into the solvent, resulting in separation of the components originally in the solid. This separation process is called \"liquid-solid leaching\" or simply \"leaching\". Because in leaching the solute is being extracted from the solid this is also called \"extraction\". In leaching, when an undesirable component is removed from a solid with water, the process is called \"washing\".\n\nIn the biological and food processing industries, many products are separated from their original natural structure by liquid-solid leaching. An important process for example is the leaching of sugar from sugar beets with hot water. In the production of vegetable oils, organic solvents such as hexane, acetone, or ether are used to extract oil from nuts, beans, and seeds.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, many different pharmaceutical products are obtained by leaching plant roots, leaves, and stems.\n\nLeaching is extensively used in metal processing industries. The useful metal may occur in mixtures with very large amounts of undesirable constituents, and leaching is used to remove the metals as soluble salts. The use of acids is prevalent in the metal processing industry. Sulfates are normally used to remove metals from the solid phase. These processes result in harmful sulfate-rich environmental byproducts. Because acids solubilize metals, large-scale release of heavy-metal-rich acidic mine drainage (AMD) can thereby occur.\n\nAs mentioned above when leaching a solid with a liquid the desired solid goes to the liquid phase while undesired solid remains. The removal of the solid as the liquid dissolves into the particle leads to a diameter of unleached core that shrinks with time. A mathematical model can be used for this process, derived using Fick's law of diffusion taking pore diffusion as rate limiting step: \n\nSome recent work has been done to see if organic acids can be used to leach lithium and cobalt from spent batteries with some success. Experiments performed with varying temperatures and concentrations of malic acid show that the optimal conditions are 2.0 m/L of organic acid at a temperature of 90 °C. The reaction had an overall efficiency exceeding 90% with no harmful byproducts.\n\nThe same analysis with citric acid showed similar results with an optimal temperature and concentration of 90 °C and 1.5 molar solution of citric acid.\n\n"}
{"id": "2014402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014402", "title": "Lead time", "text": "Lead time\n\nA lead time is the latency between the initiation and execution of a process. For example, the lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of a new car from a manufacturer may be anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months.\n\nLead time in publishing describes the amount of time that a journalist has between receiving a writing assignment and submitting the completed piece. Depending on the publication, lead times can be anything from a couple of hours to many months/years.\n\nLead time (when referring to a disease) is the length of time between detection of a disease through screening and the moment in time where it would have normally presented with symptoms and led to a diagnosis. An example of this is seen with breast cancer population screening, where women who are asymptomatic have a positive test result with mammography, whereas the underlying disease would have taken many more years to manifest.\n\nA more conventional definition of lead time in the supply chain management realm is the time from the moment the customer places an order (the moment the supplier learns of the requirement) to the moment it is ready for delivery. In the absence of finished goods or intermediate (work in progress) inventory, it is the time it takes to actually manufacture the order without any inventory other than raw materials. The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply identifies \"total lead time\" as a combination of \"internal lead time\" (the time required for the buying organisation's internal processes to progress from identification of a need to the issue of a purchase order) and \"external lead time\" (the time required for the supplying organisation's processes, including any development required, manufacture, despatch and delivery).\n\nIn the manufacturing environment, lead time has the same definition as that of Supply Chain Management, but it includes the time required to ship the parts from the supplier. The shipping time is included because the manufacturing company needs to know when the parts will be available for material requirements planning. It is also possible for lead time to include the time it takes for a company to process and have the part ready for manufacturing once it has been received. The time it takes a company to unload a product from a truck, inspect it, and move it into storage is non-trivial. With tight manufacturing constraints or when a company is using Just In Time manufacturing it is important for supply chain to know how long their own internal processes take.\n\nLead time is made of:\n\nExample\n\nCompany A needs a part that can be manufactured in two days once Company B has received an order. It takes three days for company A to receive the part once shipped, and one additional day before the part is ready to go into manufacturing.\n\nIn more detail\n\nLead Time terminology has been defined in greater detail. The Supply Chain from customer order received to the moment the order is delivered is divided into five lead times.\n\nExample \n\nA restaurant opens up and a customer walks in. A waiter guides him to a table, gives him the menu and asks what he would like to order. The customer selects a dish and the waiter writes it in his notepad. At that moment the customer has made an order which the restaurant has accepted – Order Lead Time and Order Handling Time have begun. Now the waiter marks the order in the cash register, rips the paper from the notepad, takes it into the kitchen and puts into the order queue. The order has been handled and is waiting in the factory (kitchen) for manufacturing. As there are no other customers, the waiter decides to stand outside the kitchen, by the door, waiting for the dish to be prepared and begins calculating Manufacturing Lead Time.\n\nMeanwhile, the chef finishes what he was doing, takes the order from the queue, starts his clock as a mark for the start of Production Lead Time and begins cooking. The chef chops the vegetables, fries the meat and boils the pasta. When the dish is ready, the chef rings a bell and stops his clock. At the same time the waiter stops calculating Manufacturing Lead Time and rushes through the kitchen door to get the food while it is hot.\n\nWhen he picks it up, begins counting of Delivery Lead Time that ends when the dish is served to the customer, who can now happily say that the Order Lead Time was shorter than he had expected.\n\nWhen talking about Order Lead Time (OLT) it is important to differentiate the definitions that may exist around this concept. Although they look similar there are differences between them that help the industry to model the order behavior of their customers. The four definitions are : \n\nThe OLT will be determined by the difference between the date the customer wants the material in his facilities (wish date) and the date when they provided its order to the supplier. \nThe OLT will be determined by the difference between the date the customer agree to receive the material in their facilities (Quote date) and the date when the order is provided to the supplier.\nThe OLT will be determined by the difference between the day the provider deliver the material (Delivery date) and the date when they enter the order in the system. \nThe OLT will be determined by the difference between the date the confirmed date by the provider to deliver the material in the customer facilities (Confirmed date) and the date when they provide the order to the supplier.\n\nThe Average OLT based on Volume (OLT) is the addition of all the multiplications between the volume of product we deliver (quantity) and the OLT divided by the total quantity delivered in the period of time we are studying for that specific facility.\nformula_1 \nBy doing this the company will be able to find a relation of volume weighted between the quantities of material required for an order and the time requested to accomplish it. The volume metric could be applied to the 4 types of OLT. \nThe figure obtained from this calculation will be the average time (e.g. in days) between order placing and the requested delivery date of a specific customer under consideration of the average quantities ordered during that particular time.\n\nThe correct analysis of OLT will give the company:\n\nIn project management lead time is the time it takes to complete a task or a set of interdependent tasks. The lead of the entire project would be the overall duration of the critical path for the project.\n\nLead time is also the saved time by starting an activity before its predecessor is completed.\n\nAccording to the PMI (2008), lead is a dependency between two activities (p. 140). An example would be scheduling the start of a 2-week activity dependent with the finish of the successor activity with a lead of 2 weeks so they will finish at the same time.\n\n"}

In 1917, he moved to Detroit and was hired to edit an in-house publication for Cadillac Clearing House, later becoming an advertising director for the same institution. At Cadillac, Burnett met his advertising mentor, Theodore F. MacManus, whom Burnett called \"one of the great advertising men of all time\". MacManus ran the agency that handled Cadillac's advertising.\n\nIn 1918, Burnett married Naomi Geddes. The couple met at a small restaurant near the Cadillac offices, where Naomi worked as a cashier. They went on to have three children: Peter, Joseph and Phoebe.\n\nDuring World War I, Burnett joined the Navy for six months. However, his service was mostly spent at Great Lakes building a breakwater. After his time in the military, Burnett returned to Cadillac for a short while. It was then when a few employees at Cadillac formed the LaFayette Motors Company – triggering Burnett to move to Indianapolis to work for the new establishment. Soon after, he was offered a position at Homer McKee. He then left LaFayette and joined McKee, where Burnett said of the founder, \"(He) gave me my first feel of what I have come to regard as the \"warm sell\" as contrasted to the \"hard sell\" and \"soft sell\". This was his first agency job.\n\nAfter spending a decade at McKee's, and working through the stock market crash of 1929, Burnett left the company. In 1930, he moved to Chicago and was hired by Erwin, Wasey & Company, where he was employed for five years.\n\nIn 1935, Burnett founded the Leo Burnett Company, Inc. in a suite at the Palmer House in downtown Chicago. Soon after, the operation moved to the 18th floor of the London Guarantee Building. Today, the agency has 9,000+ employees in over 85 offices globally.\n\nIn December 1967, nearing the end of his career, Burnett delivered his famous \"When To Take My Name Off The Door\" speech at the agency's annual holiday gathering.\n\nOn June 7, 1971, Burnett went to his agency, pledging to his colleagues to cut back to working only three days per week due to some health problems. That evening, at the age of 79, he died of a heart attack at his family farm in Lake Zurich, Illinois.\n\nA private company formed in 1935 and officially running under the name of 'Leo Burnett Company, Inc.', the agency started with working capital of $50,000, eight employees and three clients. Now a part of Publicis Groupe, Leo Burnett is one of the largest agency networks with 85 offices in 69 countries and 9,000+ employees.\n\nFor the first several years, Burnett billed about $1 million annually. By 1950, billings had increased to $22 million, and by 1954 the company was at $55 million annually. By the end of the 1950s, the Leo Burnett Company was billing $100 million annually.\n\n\n\nBurnett used dramatic realism in his advertising, the Soft sell approach to build brand equity. Burnett believed in finding the \"inherent drama\" of products and presenting it in advertising through warmth, shared emotions and experiences. His advertising drew from heartland-rooted values using simple, strong and instinctive imagery that talked to people. He was also known for using \"cultural archetypes\" in his copy, by creating mythical creatures that represented American values. This is evident on such campaigns as Jolly Green Giant, Tony the Tiger, Pillsbury Doughboy and more famously the Marlboro Man. Indeed, these campaigns played on the 1950s attitudes towards masculinity that pervaded his campaigns.\n\nBurnett was known for keeping a folder in the lower left-hand corner of his desk called \"Corny Language\". He collected words, phrases, and analogies that struck him as being particularly apt in expressing an idea.\n\nIn 1947, Burnett wrote \"The Good Citizen\", a booklet concerning the duties and privileges of being a U.S. citizen. This was done as a public service for The Advertising Council and The American Heritage Foundation.\n\n\n\n"}

They operate as a family enterprise, and have a full stake in Grupo SLC, a conglomerate of agroindustrial companies, one of them being SLC Agrícola , an agricultural company and land-holding corporation with properties totalling around , which ranks the Logemann Family as the 53rd largest private landowner globally.\n\nThe family, after selling their John Deere stake in 1999, heavily invested in cotton, which placed them at the very top of global production. \n\nAll family members live in Porto Alegre, the capital of Brazil's southern-most state Rio Grande do Sul. According to \"Forbes\" in 2014, the family shares a 3 billion-dollar empire divided between 19 blood members.\n\nThe family has kept away from media attention, valuing discretion above all else.\n\nThe Logemann family began its business activities with Frederico Jorge Logemann, who founded Schneider & Logemann Cia LDTA. This company had a humble shop that repaired and manufactured agricultural tools for the village. Upon development, the company began producing their own threshers. Jorge Antonio Dahne Logemann then took control upon his father's death, and began development of automotive harvesting machines, being the first of the Southern Hemisphere to ever produce one. Mr. Jorge Logemann then founded SLC Agrícola in 1977 (now the family's main business) and in 1979 he merged SLC with John Deere for a Joint venture in Brazil. In 1987, Mr. Jorge Antonio Logemann passes away, and his two sons Eduardo and Jorge Luis took leadership of the family's businesses. In 1999, Eduardo and Jorge sell SLC & John Deere back to the John Deere group, and exit the business of tool and machine fabrication. In 2007, the family issues shares of SLC Agricola in B3 (stock exchange), which allowed SLC Agrícola to become one of the 10 most important company of Rio Grande do Sul. In 2017, the family sold one of their businesses, Ferramentas Gerias, to Grupo OVD for an undisclosed amount.\n\nFrederico Jorge Logemann, German engineer from Bremen, founds in 1927 the village of Belo Horizonte, today's Horizontina. In 1945 he and his partner Balduíno Schneider found Schneider & Logemann Cia LTDA, focused in the fabrication and maintenance of agricultural tools. Two years after, the company constructed its first thresher. Mr. Logemann passed away in 1947, after which his only son, Jorge Antonio Dahne Logemann, continued his work.\n\nZaira Logemann, who passed away in 2017, was the oldest member of the family since 1987, belonging to the second generation.

{"id": "477158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477158", "title": "Michael Lowry", "text": "Michael Lowry\n\nMichael Gerard Lowry (born 13 March 1953) is an Irish Independent politician who has served as a Teachta Dála (TD) since 1987, currently for the Tipperary constituency. He previously served as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications from 1994 to 1996 and Chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party from 1993 to 1994.\n\nLowry is a former Chairman of the Fine Gael party and was Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications between 1994 and 1996. He resigned from his ministry in some controversy. Fine Gael barred him from standing for the party again. Thereafter he ran as an Independent candidate and has maintained his seat in the Dáil ever since. The Moriarty Tribunal concluded \"beyond doubt\" that Lowry was a tax evader and had assisted businessman Denis O'Brien's Esat Digiphone consortium in acquiring a lucrative mobile phone licence in the mid-1990s, during Lowry's time as Communications Minister. O'Brien went on to become one of the richest men in Ireland.\n\nLowry initiated a defamation lawsuit against an \"Irish Independent\" journalist, Sam Smyth, over an article that Smyth had written regarding the Moriarty Tribunal as well as comments that Smyth made on a TV3 show. The lawsuit was thrown out of several courts and Lowry was ordered to pay Smyth's legal costs. More recently his relationship with Kevin Phelan has come under scrutiny, with the emergence of a recorded conversation in which Lowry claims to have made an undeclared payment of €250,000.\n\nDespite being the subject of a criminal investigation resulting from several scandals pursuing him from his time in office, he continues to be very popular in his constituency.\n\nLowry was born in County Tipperary and educated at Thurles CBS. He was elected to North Tipperary County Council in 1979. In the early 1980s he was a Gaelic Athletic Association administrator, and was the youngest-ever Chairman of the Tipperary GAA Board. He runs a commercial refrigeration business, Streamline Enterprises, that he founded in controversial circumstances in 1988. Later, as chairman of the Semple Stadium Development Committee, he was involved in raising the necessary funds for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the All-Ireland Centenary Hurling final in 1984.\n\nLowry was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD for Tipperary North at the 1987 general election and in 1993 he became Chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.\n\nIn 1994 he was appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in the Rainbow Coalition government.\n\nA succession of political scandals pursued Lowry throughout his time in office. These included allegations of irregularities relating to the granting of a mobile phone licence to Esat Telecom, which were later investigated by the Moriarty Tribunal, plans for the Dublin Light Rail System and the closure of rural post offices. The 1997 McCracken Tribunal revealed supermarket tycoon Ben Dunne had paid IR£395,000 for an extension to Lowry's home in Tipperary. The Tribunal concluded that Lowry had evaded tax.\n\nThis allegation prompted Lowry's resignation from the Cabinet in November 1996. Taoiseach John Bruton announced that Lowry would not be allowed to stand as a Fine Gael candidate at the next election, and he resigned from the party.\n\nLowry announced that he would stand as an independent candidate in the 1997 general election. He topped the poll in his constituency in that election, and did so again in the 2002 and 2007 general elections.\n\nLowry is backed by a strong local organisation in Tipperary, known informally as \"Team Lowry\".\n\nLowry was re-elected to represent Tipperary North at the 2011 general election, heading the poll on the 1st count with 14,010 votes. He was elected again, for Tipperary, at the 2016 general election. He voted for Enda Kenny as Taoiseach on 6 May 2016. Shortly after Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl confirmed the result, Lowry was seen to offer a handshake to Kenny.\n\nLowry has directorships listed with the Companies Registration Office. He has two roles with Garuda Ltd, a manufacturer of electric domestic appliances; Abbeygreen Consulting, which involves construction work and special trades; and Gdlc Business Consultants Ltd., a business and management consultancy registered in Dublin. He also has an unlimited company called Glebeland Farm, which manages his bloodstock and livestock interests.\n\nLowry had some success with horse racing as a quarter-partner in the MALM partnership, but has in recent times taken to flat-race breeding.\n\nLowry owned a horse called \"Wedding Morn\", though the price he paid for the horse is not known. The horse was covered by Coolmore's \"Danehill Dancer\", from the stable of John Magnier. He would have paid up to €75,000 to have the horse covered. Another horse, \"Probably\", was sold by Lowry, which was the progeny of Wedding Morn. Wedding Morn was delivered of three foals including Probably, and the three were sold for a total of €410,000 by Lowry between 2009 and 2011. Lowry sold Wedding Morn in 2012 for €361,849.\n\nOne of the remits of the Moriarty Tribunal, which sat from 1997 to 2011, was the investigation of payments to Lowry. In early 2007 Lowry announced that he had made a full and final settlement of all outstanding payments with the Revenue Commissioners in response to the findings concerning his tax evasion. His company Garuda had to pay €1.2 million after a Revenue audit. He also paid almost €200,000 to settle his personal taxes.\n\nIn March 2011 the second and final report from the Moriarty Tribunal found that, during his time as Communications Minister, Michael Lowry assisted businessman Denis O'Brien's consortium Esat Digiphone in acquiring a lucrative mobile phone licence in the mid-1990s which ultimately made O'Brien one of the richest men in Ireland.\n\nIt concluded \"beyond doubt\" that Lowry gave what it termed \"substantive information to Denis O'Brien, of significant value and assistance to him in securing the licence\". The Tribunal report found that Lowry, displayed \"an appreciable interest\" in the process and had \"irregular interactions with interested parties at its most sensitive stages\". It also found that one of Lowry's interventions, which cut the selection process to the advantage of Esat, was \"disgraceful\" and \"insidious\", and that he had misled the Government, his party leader John Bruton and his own civil servants to influence the selection process in Esat's favour.\n\nThe tribunal also found that Lowry sought to procure unwarranted rent increases that over a seven-year period would have benefited businessman Ben Dunne. Lowry sought to influence the outcome of an arbitration being conducted in 1995 in relation to the rent payable by the then state-owned Telecom Éireann for Marlborough House to a company owned and controlled by Dunne. The report said that the matter was \"profoundly corrupt to a degree that was nothing short of breathtaking\".\n\nThe report also summarised the cumulative payments made to Lowry, and says \"In aggregating the known payments from Denis O'Brien to Michael Lowry, it is apposite to note that, between the granting of the second GSM licence to Esat Digiphone in May 1996, and the transmission of £420,000 sterling to complete the purchase of the latter of Lowry's English properties in December 1999, O'Brien had made or facilitated payments to Lowry of £147,000 sterling, £300,000 sterling and a benefit equivalent to a payment in the form of O'Brien's support for a loan of £420,000 sterling.\"\n\nLowry had addressed the Dáil saying that if he had been trying to hide a lot of money he would have \"put it in an offshore account\", implying that no such account existed. The Tribunal found that he actually had at least four such accounts that he used for the purpose of evading tax, and had not disclosed these accounts to the previous McCracken Tribunal.\n\nLowry rejected the Moriarty report, claiming that it was flawed and that the assumptions and conclusions that Justice Moriarty arrived at were totally baseless. Nonetheless the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Bureau of Fraud were called in on 29 March 2011 to begin investigating his finances, since his €1.4 million settlement with the revenue commissioners did not grant him immunity from prosecution.\n\nOn 31 March 2011, following the Moriarty Report's publication, the Dáil passed an all-party motion calling on Lowry to voluntarily resign his seat.\n\nIn 2010 Lowry launched a defamation lawsuit against \"Irish Independent\" journalist Sam Smyth, over an article Smyth had written regarding the Moriarty Tribunal as well as comments Smyth had made on a TV3 show describing Lowry as having been \"caught with his hand in the till.\" Smyth defended the defamation claim, stating he \"did not call Michael Lowry TD a thief, but did believe he was a liar and a tax cheat\". Lowry's defamation lawsuit was thrown out in the Circuit court, and again on appeal to the High Court. High Court Justice Nicholas Kearns noted that Lowry \"did not dispute that he engaged in tax fraud\", and ordered Lowry to pay Smyth's legal costs.\n\nIt emerged in October 2012 that Lowry owned land in Wigan which he had failed to declare in his register of members' interests. Between 2001 and 2003 the 25-acre site had been owned by Liam Carroll and Vineacre Ltd, a UK property company owned by him and Lowry. Vineacre Ltd was removed from the title in 2003 and Lowry declared his Vineacre interest until the company was dissolved in 2008. The land then became Lowry's and Carroll's in their own names, but he failed to declare his interest from 2008 onwards.\n\nOn 6 November 2012 Lowry amended his declaration to the Oireachtas to include the land interest, despite claiming previously that the land was \"worthless\". An unprecedented 380 complaints were made by members of the public in relation to the scandal, partly prompted by an article written by author Elaine Byrne. According to rules, the property must be worth more than €13,000 to be declared an interest. Lowry claimed the complaints were part of an \"orchestrated campaign\" against him.\n\nAs of December 2012 the probe into Lowry's failure to declare the land interest had been transferred to the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO).\n\nIn March 2013 Northern Ireland land scout Kevin Phelan revealed that Lowry had made payments to him in 2002, of which only half had been disclosed to the Moriarty Tribunal. The \"Sunday Independent\" released a secret recording of a telephone conversation made by Phelan, in which Lowry asks for nothing to be revealed about the payment to the tribunal. This was also broadcast on \"Tonight with Vincent Browne\". In November 2015, it was announced that Lowry has launched High Court proceedings against INM in relation to the tapes.\n\nLowry availed himself of the Tax Amnesty in 1993. He made a settlement with the Revenue again in 2003. In 2007 he paid a settlement of €192,000 which was due to the emergence of secret payments to him by businessman Ben Dunne. His company Garuda Limited made a settlement of €1.1m in 2005. In 2014 he faced five charges, including knowingly completing incorrect tax returns on a number of dates between 2003 and 2007. In 2018 he was found guilty on one of the charges, relating to a €372,000 payment received in 2002 but not recorded until 2006.\n\nIn January 2015 it was revealed that he lobbied Taoiseach Enda Kenny to have his female former press adviser reappointed to a State board. Lowry passed a note to the Taoiseach in the Dáil chamber asking him to consider re-appointing Valerie O'Reilly, who runs her own successful public relations agency, to the board of the National Transport Authority (NTA). The note read \"Taoiseach, would you please consider re-appointing Valerie O'Reilly to the board of the NTA. A woman, bright, intelligent and not bad looking either!\" Her initial appointment by the previous government in March 2010 provoked charges of cronyism. The incident came just three months after Kenny and Fine Gael were engulfed in another cronyism scandal involving John McNulty and the Irish Museum of Modern Art. The then Fianna Fáil senator Averil Power expressed surprise at the tone of the note and said: \"She probably does have strong business credentials, but to be referred to in this \"Father Ted\" 'lovely girls' sort of way is every women's worst nightmare. It also shows that we need far greater transparency when it comes to State board appointments\".\n\nLowry was also revealed to have lobbied Minister for Transport Paschal Donohoe on the same matter. Donohoe told journalists at UCD that he had been \"briefly\" approached by Lowry. Lowry himself confirmed he had spoken to Donohoe in the Seanad chamber's anteroom. \"I had been following a debate on a health-related issue in the Seanad and, out of courtesy, I informed Mr Donohoe, when I met him, that I had sent a note to the Taoiseach on the reappointment\" claimed Lowry. When asked to respond to media coverage of the affair, Lowry said: \"It is a load of nonsense and, frankly, more irritating than anything else.\"\n"}

{"id": "52888220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52888220", "title": "Person-centered systems theory", "text": "Person-centered systems theory\n\nThe person-centered systems theory (German: Personzentrierte Systemtheorie) is a multi-level concept for the understanding of processes in psychotherapy, counseling, coaching and clinical psychology under consideration of the interrelation of different levels – namely body, psyche, interpersonal and social processes. The concept has been developed by the German psychologist and psychotherapist Jürgen Kriz.\n\nPerson-centered systems theory focuses on the necessity to reduce the incomprehensible complexity of (physical-chemical) stimuli by means of developing meaningful structures, patterns and rules in order to create a comprehensibly simple lifeworld. In this context, the question of stability as well as adaptive transition of the patterns is essential. Moreover, the historic perspective plays an important role because it provides the only access to an understanding of cultural patterns of explanation, metaphors, narrations as well as principles of reasoning. Here, Kriz introduces the term 'meaning attractor' (German: Sinnattraktor), which he describes as reduction of the vast possibilities of understanding and communication providing certainty and stability while limiting change, adaptation and creativity. Accordingly, it is an essential objective of person-centered systems theory to explain the effects of psychotherapy – and clinical processes in general – across various methods and schools of thought.\n\nThe systems theoretical (meta-) perspective of the person-centered systems theory refers to the systems-theoretical concepts of Gestalt psychology as well as humanistic psychotherapy (Carl Rogers' person-centered approach in particular) on the one hand and the relations to modern interdisciplinary systems theory (especially concepts of self-organization and synergetics) on the other.\n\nContrary to the common systems approach in psychotherapy – as in systemic and family therapy -, person-centered systems theory does not primarily focus on patterns of interactions and communication respectively but it takes into account the individual (the person in the sense of person-centered psychotherapy) as well as the underlying somatic processes and the cultural embedding of meaning processes. After all, central aspects like sense, mind, meaning or coherence are related to the level of personal processes – even if these are substantially affected in their biographical and historical dynamic by social processes. A social system can define and/or prescribe something as meaningful – however, experiencing it as something meaningful is an intrinsic process of that person (first person perspective).\n\nAccording to the model of synergetics, the patterns at each process level can be stable (for a given time) or show phase transitions. The former comes along with the positive aspects of predictability, familiarity and security, but the negative aspects of rigidity, solidification and non-adaptation. The latter is experienced as leaving old and inadequate patterns behind in order to reach new and better adapted ones. This has the positive aspects of novelty, creativity and uniqueness, but the negative aspects of instability, uncertainty and chaos. In the life-course of individuals, couples, families, groups and organizations, both phases of stability and of pattern transitions are necessary. Many symptoms and problems are related to over-stabilization of patterns, which have been good solutions to some requirements but are no longer adequate or functional due to the fact that the requirements have changed.\n\nThe person-centered systems theory describes the systemic effects of communication between humans (couples, families, organizations) as well as their interrelations through internal processes (perception, thinking, feeling) in its complex, non-linear interaction both bottom-up and top-down.\n\nKriz (2017) provides a comprehensive presentation and discussion of the person-centered systems theory.\n\n\n"}

In software engineering, this is known as version control. The goals of product data management include ensuring all stakeholders share a common understanding, that confusion during the execution of the processes is minimized, and that the highest standards of quality controls are maintained.\n\nProduct data management is the use of software or other tools to track and control data related to a particular product. The data tracked usually involves the technical specifications of the product, specifications for manufacture and development, and the types of materials that will be required to produce goods. The use of product data management allows a company to track the various costs associated with the creation and launch of a product. Product data management is part of product lifecycle management and configuration management, and is primarily used by engineers.\n\nWithin PDM the focus is on managing and tracking the creation, change and archive of all information related to a product. The information being stored and managed (on one or more file servers) will include engineering data such as computer-aided design (CAD) models, drawings and their associated documents.\n\nProduct data management (PDM) serves as a central knowledge repository for process and product history, and promotes integration and data exchange among all business users who interact with products — including project managers, engineers, sales people, buyers, and quality assurance teams.\n\nThe central database will also manage metadata such as owner of a file and release status of the components. The package will: control check-in and check-out of the product data to multi-user; carry out engineering change management and release control on all versions/issues of components in a product; build and manipulate the product structure bill of materials (BOM) for assemblies; and assist in configurations management of product variants.\n\nThis enables automatic reports on product costs, etc. Furthermore, PDM enables companies producing complex products to spread product data into the entire PLM launch-process. This significantly enhances the effectiveness of the launch process.\n\nProduct data management is focused on capturing and maintaining information on products and/or services through its development and useful life. Typical information managed in the PDM module include\n\n\nProduct Data Management is closely related and often used interchangeably with Product Information Management (PIM). PDM software applications are commonly used by companies involved with manufacturing and retailing. Examples of PDM software vendors include CMPRO, SOLIDWORKS, Zentail and Bintime/Gepard.\nApart from those providers, in the market exist other kind of vendors that offer PDM systems with extra functionalities such as Sales Layer.\n\nPDM stems from traditional engineering design activities that created product drawings and schematics on paper and using CAD tools to create parts lists (Bills of Material structures – BOM). The PDM and BOM data is used in enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to plan and coordinate all transactional operations of a company (sales order management, purchasing, cost accounting, logistics, etc.)\n\nPDM is a subset of a larger concept of product lifecycle management (PLM). PLM encompasses the processes needed to launch new products (NPI), manage changes to existing products (ECN/ECO) and retire products at the end of their life (EoL).\n\nHow to select a PDM system in 5 simple steps\n\n\n"}

It has grown to become the largest annual day of charitable service in the United States.\n\nAccording to the nonprofit MyGoodDeed, which founded the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance (\"9/11 Day\") in 2002, the goal of \"9/11 Day\" is \"to keep alive the spirit of unity and compassion that arose in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks in tribute to the individuals lost and injured in the attacks, and the many who rose in service in response.\" The idea of making September 11 an annual day of service was first conceived in the winter of 2001 by David Paine, a former marketing executive from New York City. In the Spring of 2002 David was joined by his friend Jay Winuk, who had lost his brother Glenn Winuk in the attacks at the World Trade Center, and together they formed the nonprofit group called One Day's Pay. In 2007, the name of the organization was officially changed to MyGoodDeed. In 2009, MyGoodDeed successfully led an effort to designate September 11 under federal law as a National Day of Service and Remembrance, which occurred as part of passage of the bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by the United States Congress, and later, by an amendment to the Patriot Day Presidential Proclamation by President Barack Obama, which formally recognized and established September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act authorized the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a federal agency, to assist the 9/11 community in building awareness of and support for \"9/11 Day\" through its national service programs. In 2011, on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, MyGoodDeed, CNCS and the Points of Light Institute/HandsOn Network joined together to organize the largest day of charitable service in U.S. history, with more than 32 million Americans participating, according to research conducted by Horizon Consumer Science on behalf of MyGoodDeed. Today, 9/11 Day continues to engage nearly 30 million Americans annually in various forms of charitable service, including volunteering, donations to charities, and simple good deeds.\n\nActivities by volunteers on this federally-recognized National Day of Service and Remembrance happen all across the nation, and include lesson plans that engage tens of thousands of students of all ages in service activities; coast-to-coast blood drives; meal packing projects; painting and refurbishing homes; food drives; reclaiming neighborhoods; helping communities prepare for disasters; and countless other activities that support and honor those lost and injured on 9/11; veterans, soldiers, military families, and rescue and recovery workers, including first responders. Among the largest projects held annually are two large-scale hunger relief projects, one in New York City and another at the National Mall in Washington, DC, which mobilize a total of more than 7,000 volunteers who together pack over two million meals for individuals at risk of hunger. In Boston, thousands join together on 9/11 at the Rose Kennedy Greenway to assemble care packages for military personnel.

It has a particular focus on offshore financial centres that behave as corporate tax havens.\nThe Tax Justice Network gathers organizations, social movements, and advocates for international tax cooperation, and against tax evasion and tax competition. TJN's goal is to achieve progressive, democratic, and socially just tax systems. It carries out campaigns from an internationalist perspective whose purpose is to develop a fiscal system that is favourable to the poor in developing and developed countries, that finances public good, and that mitigates public wrongs such as pollution and unacceptable inequality.\n\nTJN grew out thank to the process of the global social forum and the international movement of ATTAC. TJN is a multilingual, non-partisan, non-governmental, plural and diverse network. It has as members and militants’ organizations of social movements and national, regional and local civil society, as well as activists for justice in taxes, researchers, journalists, development specialists, trade unionists, and professionals of taxation, politicians and officials.\n\nCivil Society is progressively committing itself to the issues of capital flight, tax evasion and tax fraud and competition, which are generally seen as obstacles to the mobilization of national resources in developing countries. In June 2000, one of the main NGOs dedicated to development published a report titled Tax Havens: “Unlocking the hidden billions to eradicate poverty”. The creation of the Tax Justice Network was in part a consequence of the publication of that report. In the United States, the Citizens for Tax Justice Organization has undertaken a similar effort, although with a national focus. On the contrary, TJN focuses primarily on the international level.\n\nSince 2000, ATTAC, which was born in France in support of the called Tobin tax, has become a movement of international pressure that faces the problems of tax fraud, financial crime and the abuse of tax havens. In April 2005, ATTAC-Spain asked the Government not to recognize the fictitious and instrumental companies registered in tax havens before the Spanish legal system. And ATTAC-Germany played a decisive role in the creation of Tax Justice Network, whose diffusion is spreading in the Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nUntil recently, international fiscal policy was hardly a field for civil campaigns, as can be demonstrated by an example. In June 2003, the G8 meeting in Evian summoned 300,000 demonstrators in Geneva, 3,000 people registered to pressure the delegates and Geneva came to a standstill. In December 2003 the UN Committee of Fiscal Experts met in Geneva and TJN was the only civil society organization that attended and intervened in the meeting.\n\nThe main purpose is to combat the lobbying activities of accounting, business or law organizations that use considerable amounts of time and money to ensure favourable tax treatment for wealthy individuals and powerful organizations that shape their customers. \nOther functions of TJN:\n\n\n\nIt is managed by its member organizations as well as by individual militants. It ensures the visibility of member organizations in their activities and participation in the decision-making of the Network. It operates in accordance with the principles of participatory democracy, its empowerment, transparency, accountability and equal opportunities. TJN encourages and supports, when necessary, member organizations and individuals to participate in decision making. The Network supports the development of national TJN campaigns, particularly in developing countries. The activities of the Network are coordinated by an international secretariat. \nThe Network includes:\n\nIn March 2005, TJN published the results of an investigation that demonstrated $ 11.5 million of the personal wealth of wealthy individuals held in offshore financial centers. In addition, to minimize taxes or to avoid paying them, a large proportion of this wealth is managed in about 70 tax havens. If the income from this wealth patrimony will pay the taxes in the countries where these rich individuals reside or where they obtain their wealth, the additional tax collection available for the financing of public services and for investment in the whole world would be around 255,000 million of annual dollars. We emphasize that this estimate of the loss of tax revenues does not include the tax evasion of transnational corporations or the reduction of tax revenues caused by tax competition.\n\nThe Financial Secrecy Index is a biennial publication of the TJN which was started in 2009 and was last released in January 2018. It covers 112 global jurisdictions and produces a \"Secrecy Indicator\" score for each on based on 20 qualitative criteria. Releases are widely covered in the media.\n\nThe TJN has reported on the OECD Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) projects and conducted their own research that the scale of corporate taxes being avoided by multinationals is an estimated $660bn in 2012 (a quarter of US multinationals’ gross profits), which is equivalent to 0.9% of World GDP. \n\nIn July 2012, following a study into wealthy individuals with offshore accounts, the Tax Justice Network published claims regarding deposits worth at least $21 trillion (£13 trillion), potentially even $32 trillion, in secretive tax havens. As a result, governments suffer a lack of income taxes of up to $280 billion.\n\n\n"}

Maia contributed to Brazilian music within a wide variety of musical genres, including soul, funk, bossa nova, disco, romantic ballads, pop, rock, jazz, baião and MPB. He introduced the soul style on the Brazilian musical scene. Tim Maia is internationally recognised as one of the biggest icons of the Brazilian music.\n\nTim Maia recorded numerous albums and toured extensively in a long career. After his early death in 1998, his recorded oeuvre has shown enduring popularity. A theatrical retrospective of his career, the popular musical \"Vale Tudo\", was first staged in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.\n\nMaia was born in the Tijuca neighbourhood, in the southern suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. He began writing melodies while still a child, the second youngest of nineteen children. Then known as \"Tião Maia\", he wrote his earliest songs at age eight. At fourteen, as a drummer, he formed the group Os Tijucanos do Ritmo, which lasted one year. He then took guitar classes and was soon teaching other children in Tijuca. He also gave lessons to his friends Erasmo Esteves and Roberto Carlos, fellow members of the so-called Matoso Gang. Named after the street where they used to hang out, the gang also included Jorge Ben and Erasmo Carlos, among others. They liked to listen to the earliest styles of rock and roll, with both Maia and Ben being nicknamed \"Babulina\" after their enthusiastic pronunciation of Ronnie Self's song \"Bop-A-Lena\".\n\nIn 1957, Maia, Carlos, Arlênio Silva, Edson Trindade and Wellington started the vocal group The Sputniks. After a televised appearance on Carlos Imperial's \"Clube do Rock\" on TV Tupi, Imperial arranged a solo appearance for Roberto Carlos the following week. Maia got annoyed at this, leading him to insult Carlos in the following rehearsals until his bandmate left the group. After watching Carlos' concert the following week, Maia left The Sputniks, and went after Imperial for a solo appearance. Imperial eventually suggested another artistic name, Tim, which Maia accepted with reservations.\n\nIn 1959, Maia went to study in the United States, where he lived for four years. He joined a vocal harmony ensemble, The Ideals, and wrote the lyrics to \"New Love\", which was recorded as a demo with guest percussion by a young Milton Banana. (Maia also recorded the song as a soloist in 1973). The group's career was derailed in 1963 when Maia was arrested for possession of marijuana and deported back to Brazil.\n\nAfter returning, Maia had a few unsuccessful jobs and arrests in Rio. Eventually he decided to move to São Paulo to try to get help to kickstart his musical career from Carlos, who was beginning to enjoy the massive success of Jovem Guarda with Esteves. Carlos was inaccessible, but Maia started to perform in São Paulo's nightlife and in Wilson Simonal's radio program, and also had a televised appearance at TV Bandeirantes with Os Mutantes. By the end of 1967 Maia managed to send a homemade recording to Carlos, who got Maia a deal for a single at CBS and an appearance on the \"Jovem Guarda\" TV program. His first single in 1968, \"Meu País\" backed by \"Sentimento\", went unnoticed, as was another single, \"These Are the Songs\"/\"What Do You Want to Bet?\", recorded in English for RGE Discos. Maia also wrote one of Carlos' hits, \"Não Vou Ficar\". He became more visible after 1969 when he launched his \"These Are the Songs,\" which was re-recorded by Elis Regina in the next year in a duo with Maia. Maia managed a deal with Polydor/Philips and recorded the successful single \"Primavera\".\n\nIn the 1970s, Maia started to record albums and perform shows promoting his synthesis of American soul and Brazilian music with elements of samba and baião. The movement gradually took the working-class suburbs of the north side of Rio de Janeiro, exploding in 1976 with the black movement.\n\nIn 1970, Maia recorded his first full-length LP, \"Tim Maia\", which included the classics \"Azul da Cor do Mar\", \"Coroné Antônio Bento\", and \"Primavera\", and topped the charts for 24 weeks in Rio de Janeiro. His first four albums were all self-titled. Next year's \"Tim Maia\" had other hits including \"Não Quero Dinheiro (Só Quero Amar)\" and \"Preciso Aprender a Ser Só\". His fourth album, released in 1973, included \"Réu Confesso\" and \"Gostava Tanto de Você\". Angry at how the music publisher distributed the royalties, Maia opened his own, Seroma (derived from the first syllables of his first, middle and last names), to make sure he had a bigger cut of the profits.\n\nAfter his fourth album, Maia left Polydor for RCA Victor, who offered him a chance to record a double album. The instrumental parts were all ready when Maia went to his composing friend Tibério Gaspar for help with the lyrics. In his house Maia found the book \"Universo em Desencanto\" (Disenchanting Universe), revolving around the cult of Rational Culture. Maia converted to the cult, abandoned the drugs and red meat, and decided to write the lyrics for the songs about the knowledge contained in the book. RCA rejected the albums \"Tim Maia Racional, Vols. 1 & 2\" for the newly found spiritual content, but Maia bought the master tapes from them and released the albums independently through label Seroma Discos, which would split its profits with the cult. While the lead single \"Que Beleza (Imunização Racional)\" had some airplay, at the time these records were not well received, due to inadequate distribution, and the spiritual content alienating both the radios and Maia's fans. Eventually, the artist could only perform at events promoted by the Rational Culture. Eventually in 1975, Maia got fed up with the cult, destroyed the unsold records and went back to his carefree life. The \"Racional\" albums are now regarded as classics and saw re-release in 2005.\n\nFor his return in 1976, Maia signed with Polygram and recorded an album also titled \"Tim Maia\", which included the hit \"Rodésia\" (inspired by the Rhodesian Bush War), and also did a self-published album in English. In 1977 Maia signed with Som Livre, where he recorded the album \"Verão Carioca\". In 1978 Maia signed with Warner Bros. Records and incorporated the disco sound of the period in the album \"Tim Maia Disco Club\", which spawned the hits \"Sossego\" and \"Acenda o Farol\". In 1979 Maia recorded \"Reencontro\" for EMI-Odeon, but revolted at the label's estimated promotion costs which were the same as the money spent recording, Maia fought with the marketing executive, and in response EMI president fired Maia, releasing the album with no publicity to low sales.\n\nIn 1980, Maia recorded another self-titled album for Polygram. The following year, with turbulent passages through all the major labels in Brazil, Maia released again through Seroma the album \"Nuvens\", which flopped due to inefficient distribution. To earn cash for his future albums, Maia was a guest in songs by Fevers, Edu Lobo and Chico Buarque, Ivan Lins and Sandra de Sá. His collaboration with Sá, \"Vale Tudo\", later became a solo hit for Maia.\nIn 1983 he had hits with \"O Descobridor dos Sete Mares\" and \"Me Dê Motivo\", included on \"O Descobridor dos Sete Mares\" (Polygram). Another milestone of his career in the 1980s was \"Tim Maia\" (1986), which had the hit \"Do Leme ao Pontal (Tomo Guaraná, Suco de Caju, Goiabada Para Sobremesa)\".\n\nIn 1990, Maia saw Caetano Veloso's songbook and asked editor Almir Chediak to do one for his own work. Chediak was working on such an album with bossa nova classics, and Maia requested a copy, which eventually inspired him to do a self-released album of bossa nova covers, \"Tim Maia Interpreta Clássicos da Bossa Nova\". After a period of poor presence in the media, he was again on top after being mentioned by Jorge Ben Jor's \"W/Brasil\" in 1991. In the same period, Maia had another hit with his re-recording of Lulu Santos' \"Como uma Onda\" for a television advertisement – Santos in return recorded Maia's \"Descobridor dos Sete Mares.\n\nAt the same time, he withdrew from majors, recording his next albums through Vitória Régia, including \"What a Wonderful World\" (1997), where he recorded American pop/soul classics, and \"Amigos do Rei/Tim Maia e Os Cariocas\", with the famous vocal group. Obese and in bad health, in March 8, 1998 he was performing at the Municipal Theater of Niterói when he became ill. He was hospitalized and died a few days later.\n\nTim Maia had two sons: Carmelo Maia (also known as Telmo, b. 1975) with Geisa Gomes da Silva, and José Carlos da Silva Nogueira (1966–2002). He was also the surrogate father of Geisa's other son, Marcio Leonardo \"Léo\" Maia (b. 1974). Léo was registered by Tim as his son, although he knew that Léo was not his child, since he met his wife Geisa when she was already pregnant. She had been separated from her boyfriend, who refused to recognize Léo as his child. Tim and Geisa started living together but they broke up after a few arguments. When they made up, she was pregnant with Carmelo. Tim registered Carmelo and married her. When Léo Maia was 12, Tim Maia and Geisa divorced.\n\nMaia lived in the United States of America from 1959 to 1963. He first resided Tarrytown, New York, with the family of an acquaintance of Maia's father's costumer. There he learned English and did not speak much Portuguese because so few Brazilians were living in the USA at the time. In 1961, Maia moved to New York City, and in 1963 with a group of three friends decided to travel to Southern United States. With a stolen car and performing small thefts to finance the journey (which got him arrested five times), Maia and friends travelled through nine states before arriving in Florida. In Daytona Beach, Maia had his final imprisonment for marijuana possession, which earned him deportation back to Brazil.\nTim Maia became a member of the Brazilian Socialist Party (\"Partido Socialista Brasileiro – PSB\") in October 1997. He was rumoured to have joined the party in order to run for a seat in the Federal Senate for Rio de Janeiro in the 1998 general elections, but died before that. When asked by a reporter why he chose to join the then small PSB, he replied: \"Brazil is the only country where – in addition to whores cumming, pimps being jealous and drug dealers being addicted – poor people vote for the right-wing\". His phrase would become a famous aphorism on the way Brazilians face politics.\n\nHe was also known his easygoing lifestyle, and for his habit of lightheartedly missing appointments and even important gigs. Indeed, Maia had a tradition of arriving late at concerts, at times missing them altogether. He also frequently complained about the sound quality in them. Many of his missed concerts were due to what he called his \"triathlon\", consuming whiskey, cocaine and marijuana before a gig. In the end of his life, Tim Maia suffered from many health problems which included diabetes, acute hypertension, obesity and pulmonary embolism. In 1996, he had a Fournier gangrene solved through an emergency operation.\n\nAfter his death, Maia was the subject of numerous tributes by Música popular brasileira artists; two lavish commemorations in 1999 and 2000 were each released on CD and DVD. A biography, \"Vale Tudo – O Som e a Fúria de Tim Maia\", was published in 2011 by one of Maia's personal friends, Nelson Motta. Motta later worked with João Fonseca on a stage version of the book – their musical retrospective \"Tim Maia: Vale Tudo\" began a successful theatrical run in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. The film adaptation \"Tim Maia\" based on the book was released in 2014.\n\nIn 2004, Som Livre released an album of posthumous duets entitled \"Soul Tim: Duetos\". Maia's entire discography, including the never before seen third volume of \"Tim Maia Racional\", was reissued by Editora Abril in 2011. In October 2012, American record label Luaka Bop released a Maia compilation entitled \"Nobody Can Live Forever.\"\n\nIn January 2001, Guns N' Roses guitarist Robin Finck sang \"Sossego\" during the Rock in Rio III festival. In 2007, TV Globo recorded a special program about Maia, \"Por Toda a Minha Vida\", and in 2009, Globo had an episode of its show \"Som Brasil\" with Maia's songs, performed by his son Léo and Seu Jorge among other artists. TV Cultura (São Paulo's public broadcasting) released in 2012 of their \"Ensaio\" music program.\n\nMaia released his first album in 1970 and recorded frequently throughout his career. The following is a representative list drawn from his extensive catalog:\n\n"}

The collection was made publicly available for the first time in 1952 when Fehr and other collectors were invited to display historic pieces at the castle. A decade later the collection was purchased by the state and is now owned by The Department of Arts and Culture of South Africa.\n\nWilliam Fehr was born in a remote colonial outpost called Burgersdorp, a small town that linked the Cape Colony in the eastern frontier to the south of the Free State via a newly built railway. Fehr attended an Academy school in the little town. In 1901 his father Carl Fehr, who was a successful businessman in the town, moved his family back to his hometown of Wiesbaden in Germany as a result of his poor health and the looming threat of the Anglo-Boer War . In Wiesbaden, William and his two younger siblings Gordon and Bertha attended Kënigliches Real-Gymnasium Schule .\n\nBy 1912 William had taken up an apprenticeship at Edward Markus, a commerce firm in Berlin. In 1914 he became the head of the company's samples department at its London branch, a city that began refining his love for fine art .\n\nDue to World War I, Carl decided to leave Europe and relocate his family back to the Cape Colony, with William following shortly thereafter. William found employment in East London at a commerce firm called Messrs. Malcomess & Co., Ltd. .\n\nDuring the 1920s William began assembling a personal art collection from colonial era Africa dating as far back as the 15th Century . This collection included paintings, prints and drawings, a collection which would later be extended to interior décor artefacts . His most prized works were in the form of personal pictures from his time growing up. William was fascinated with the ever-expanding and evolving medium of photography, and its ability to capture ordinary life onto a glass plate . \n\nIn the early to mid 19th Century there was a lack of systematic artifacts gathering by South African cultural and heritage institutions, particularly by the South African government. By this time William was one of the foremost art collectors in South Africa. In 1952 he lent his personal collection for public exhibition to the Van Riebeeck Tercentenary Festival which was housed at the Castle of Good Hope .\nIn 1964 the South African government purchased his personal collections, which by then included oil paintings, furniture, ceramic, metal and glassware. This collection can still be seen at the Castle of Good Hope today . In 1965 he donated more of his personal artifacts to the South African government, works which were housed at Rust en Vreugd in the Cape Town City Centre .\nToday local and international researchers and artists continue to show interest in studying The William Fehr Collection as a way on interrogating a part of Africa's cultural and colonial heritage . Prints have been done of some of the pictures being house at the Castle, which can now be purchased through the Africa Media Online portal .\n\n"}

He was a third-generation member of the Rockefeller family.\n\nWinthrop Rockefeller was born in New York, to philanthropists John Davison Rockefeller Jr. (1874–1960) and Abigail Greene \"Abby\" Aldrich (1874–1948). He had one elder sister named Abby, three elder brothers John III, Nelson, and Laurance, and a younger brother named David. Nelson served as Governor of New York and Vice President of the United States.\n\nWinthrop attended Yale University (1931–34) but was ejected as a result of misbehavior before earning his degree. Prior to attending Yale, he graduated from the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut.\n\nIn early 1941, he enlisted in the Army. As a soldier of the 77th Infantry Division, he fought in World War II, advancing from Private to Lieutenant Colonel. He earned a Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Clusters and a Purple Heart for his actions aboard the troopship USS \"Henrico\", after a kamikaze attack during the invasion of Okinawa. His image appears in the Infantry Officer Hall of Fame at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nOn February 14, 1948, Winthrop married actress Jievute \"Bobo\" Paulekiute (September 6, 1916 – May 19, 2008). She was previously married to Boston Brahmin socialite John Sears Jr. The wedding took place in Florida, and at the reception, a choir sang Negro spirituals. On September 17, 1948, she gave birth to their son, Winthrop Paul \"Win\" Rockefeller.\n\nThe couple separated in 1950 and divorced in 1954. Bobo got custody of Win.\n\nOn June 11, 1956, Rockefeller wed the Seattle-born socialite Jeanette Edris (1918–1997). She had two children, Bruce and Ann Bartley, from a previous marriage. Winthrop and Jeanette had no children together and divorced shortly after he left the governorship in 1971.\n\nAs the state's First Lady, Jeanette Rockefeller took a special interest in mental health issues.\n\nRockefeller moved to central Arkansas in 1953 and established \"Winrock Enterprises\" and \"Winrock Farms\" atop Petit Jean Mountain near Morrilton in Conway County.\n\nIn 1954, Republican Pratt C. Remmel polled 37 percent of the vote in the gubernatorial general election against Democrat Orval Faubus. It was a good showing for a Republican candidate in Arkansas, compared to previous races in the 1940s and early 1950s. Twelve years later, Rockefeller would build upon Remmel's race and win the governorship for the Republican Party.\n\nIn 1955, Faubus appointed Rockefeller chairman of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission (AIDC).\n\nRockefeller initiated a number of philanthropies and projects. He financed the building of a model school at Morrilton and led efforts to establish a Fine Arts Center in the capital city of Little Rock. He also financed the construction of medical clinics in some of the state's poorest counties, in addition to making annual gifts to the state's colleges and universities. These philanthropic activities continue to this day through the \"Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation\".\n\nIn 1960, Rockefeller did not seek the governorship but instead raised funds for the Republican nominee, Henry M. Britt, a conservative lawyer from Hot Springs, the seat of Garland County. Britt lost in every county and barely polled 30 percent of the statewide vote in his loss to Faubus. In 1961, Rockefeller was named Arkansas Republican national committeeman, having succeeded Wallace Townsend, a lawyer in Little Rock who had held the position since 1928. In 1962, Rockefeller supported Willis Ricketts, another in a long line of failed Republican candidates who sought to topple Faubus. He also supported a slate of Republican legislative candidates. Soon, he quarreled with state Republican party chairman William L. Spicer of Fort Smith over the direction of the party. Spicer favored a stronger conservative approach compared to Rockefeller's moderate-to-liberal outlook.\n\nRockefeller resigned his position with the AIDC and conducted his first campaign for governor in 1964 against Faubus. His campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, but Rockefeller energized and reformed the tiny Republican Party to set the stage for the future. In 1964, Osro Cobb, a Republican former state chairman who had also served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, refused to endorse Rockefeller but openly Faubus, who subseqauently gave Cobb a temporary appointment to the Arkansas Supreme Court.\n\nIn his memoirs, Cobb recalls that Rockefeller\n\nhad used ruthless tactics to convert the fine Republican state organization into a one-man Rockefeller machine, loyal not to party but to Rockefeller personally. In rapid succession, Mr. Rockefeller captiously took over most of the functions of the state chairman and in a matter of months succeeded in taking over and exercising absolute right of dictation as to each and every important party function at the state level. Such one-man dictatorship is clearly the deadly enemy of any semblance of two-party government. ... Faithful Republican leaders who have worked tirelessly over the years have been pushed aside or replaced. ... A stranger passing through Arkansas at this time and seeing Mr. Rockefeller's advertising on billboards would not know whether Mr. Rockefeller belonged to any political party. Certainly the fact that he is the Republican nominee has not been included. The evidence simply is unanswerable that Mr. Rockefeller is working for his own personal interest to the exclusion of all other considerations, which leaves the Republican Party in Arkansas hanging precariously at the whims of one individual ... .\n\nWhen Rockefeller made his second run in the 1966 election, only 11 percent of Arkansans considered themselves Republicans. But Arkansans had tired of Faubus after six terms as governor and as head of the Democratic \"machine\". Democrats themselves seemed to be more interested in the reforms that Rockefeller offered in his campaign than \"winning another one for the party\". An odd coalition of Republicans and Democratic reform voters catapulted Rockefeller into the governor's office, as he defeated a segregationist Democratic former Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, James D. Johnson of Conway in Faulkner County, who preferred the appellation \"Justice Jim\".\n\nFormer state Republican chairman Osro Cobb reversed himself in 1966 and endorsed Rockefeller. He explains:\n\nArkansas Republicans were eager to work with Winthrop Rockefeller on another race for governor if he could be led to run as a true Republican to help build the party in the state. I liked him personally. He showed me many courtesies, and I still thought [despite feelings in 1964] that he would make a good governor and could be elected on the Republican ticket. ... He had learned a lesson. And he won his next two races for governor. ... His service contributed greatly to the enormous benefits of two-party government in Arkansas.\n\nIn a surprise, Rockefeller's running-mate for lieutenant governor, Maurice L. Britt, a decorated World War II veteran and a former professional football player, was narrowly elected to the second-ranking post over the Democrat James Pilkington of Hope, Arkansas.\n\nOther Rockefeller running-mates, such as former Democratic State Representative Jerry Thomasson of Arkadelphia, who sought the office of attorney general in 1966 and 1968, and Leona Troxell of Rose Bud in White County, who ran for state treasurer in 1968, were defeated.\n\nOnly three Republicans won election to the 100-member Arkansas House of Representatives at the time of Rockefeller's first victory: George E. Nowotny, of Fort Smith, Danny Patrick of Madison County, and Jim Sheets of Siloam Springs in Benton County. Another Republican representative, Marshall Chrisman of Ozark in Franklin County, served in the state House from 1969 to 1970.\n\nTwo Republicans ran for U.S. Representative on the Rockefeller ticket in 1966. John Paul Hammerschmidt, the outgoing party chairman, won in the northwestern Third District. Lynn Lowe, a Texarkana farmer, who later served as party chairman from 1974–1980, lost in the southern Fourth District race to the Democrat David Pryor.\n\nAt the time Winthrop became governor, his brother Nelson Rockefeller had been the governor of New York since 1959, and remained so throughout Winthrop's four years in office. They are often erroneously cited as the first two brothers to be governors at the same time, but they were actually the third case; the previous instances were Levi and Enoch Lincoln from 1827 to 1829, and John and William Bigler from 1852 to 1855. More recently, George W. and Jeb Bush were both governors from 1999 to 2000.\n\nAt the 1968 Republican National Convention, Winthrop Rockefeller received backing from members of the Arkansas delegation as a \"favorite son\" presidential candidate. He received all of his state's 18 votes; his brother Nelson, then concluding a major presidential bid against Richard M. Nixon, received 277. This was the only time in the 20th century that the names of two brothers were placed into nomination at the same time.\n\nThe Rockefeller administration enthusiastically embarked on a series of reforms but faced a hostile Democratic legislature. Rockefeller endured a number of personal attacks and a concerted whispering campaign regarding his personal life.\n\nScholars Diane Blair and Jay L. Barth continue: \"As long as Rockefeller led the Arkansas Republicans, the party had a progressive, reformist cast, and those whom Rockefeller had brought into the party continued to dominate party offices and shape presidential preferences until 1980,\" when the nomination and election of Ronald Reagan of California as president and Frank D. White as governor moved power within the state GOP \"sharply to the right.\" Ultimately the growth of the Republican Party was slower in Arkansas than in the other southern states in the post-segregation era. Blair and Barth attribute sluggish GOP development to \"tradition, [which] is important to rural people. They are looking for ways to stay with the Democratic Party; they have to be run off.\"\n\nAccording to his biographer, Cathy Kunzinger Urwin, Rockefeller's \"good-government\" reform proposals included: revision of the Arkansas State Constitution, governmental administrative reorganization, election law reform (a \"little Hatch Act\" to prohibit state employees from engaging in political activities on the job), teacher tenure, taxpayer-funded kindergarten under Amendment 53, adult and continuing education programs, rehabilitation and vocational training in the corrections system, and the recurring attempts at industrial recruitment. One of Rockefeller's most publicized \"good-government\" reforms was the ending of illegal gambling in the resort city of Hot Springs. He also made headway in streamlining state government and secured passage of a state minimum-wage law.\n\nUrwin determined that Rockefeller's negatives created public perceptions of \"his personal flaws, rather than his accomplishments or lack of them, as governor.\" Considered a weak administrator, he depended too heavily on staff, so improperly managed that the employees often failed to answer mail. He was habitually tardy to meetings. A special legislative session in May 1968 was particularly disastrous. An Oliver Quayle poll in 1968 declared that Rockefeller seemed \"strange, alien, and foreign\" to many voters. The poll maintained that many thought Rockefeller sought too much power, that he drank too much, and that he spent too little time in his office. A majority said that the wealthy Rockefeller, despite his interest in \"good government,\" could not understand the problems of common people on restricted incomes or those in the middle class with limited investment opportunities.\n\nRockefeller had a particular interest in the reform of the Arkansas prison system. Soon after his election he had received a shocking report from the Arkansas State Police on the brutal conditions within the prison system. He decried the \"lack of righteous indignation\" about the situation and created a new Department of Corrections. He appointed a new warden, academic Tom Murton, the first professional penologist that the state had ever retained in that capacity. However, he fired Murton less than a year later, when Murton's aggressive attempts to expose decades of corruption in the system subjected Arkansas to nationwide contempt.\n\nRockefeller also focused on the state's lackluster educational system and proposed funding increases for new buildings and teacher salaries when the legislature allowed.\n\nIn 1967, Rockefeller named an FBI agent, Lynn A. Davis, to head the state police with orders to halt illegal gambling in Hot Springs. After sensational raids against the mobsters, Davis was forced out as police director 128 days later when the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that he did not meet the strict 10-year residency requirement for the appointment. Democratic lawmakers refused to change the rule to allow Davis to serve. The Hot Springs raids were the No. 1 news story in Arkansas in 1967 as determined by the Associated Press.\n\nRockefeller won re-election in November 1968, having defeated Marion H. Crank, a state legislator from Foreman in Little River County, who had won the Democratic nomination in a heated fight with Virginia Morris Johnson, wife of Jim Johnson and the first woman ever to seek the office of governor of Arkansas. Newly reelected, Rockefeller proposed tax increases to fund additional reforms and his second term began on January 14, 1969. Rockefeller and the legislature dueled with competing public-relations campaigns and Rockefeller's plan ultimately collapsed in the face of public indifference.\n\nWith Rockefeller's reelection, the Republicans won a rare seat in the Arkansas State Senate with the election of Jim R. Caldwell of Rogers in northwestern Arkansas.\n\nThroughout the Rockefeller administration, the state Republican Party chairman was the attorney Odell Pollard of Searcy in White County, who once said that he and Rockefeller agreed on everything.\n\nMuch of Rockefeller's second term was spent in conflict with the opposition legislature. In 1969, he told the lawmakers that his reelection the previous November had meant that a slim majority of voters had approved of tax increases. He proposed to spend half of the new revenues sought on education, 12 percent on health and welfare, 10 percent on local government, and the remainder on state employee salaries and streamlined services. \"There are no frills in what I am proposing ... . no luxuries ... . no monuments to me as an individual ... . I implore every member of the General Assembly as I have myself: Listen to the voice of the people ... . not to the selfish interests.\"\n\nErnest Dumas, then with the since defunct \"Arkansas Gazette\" in Little Rock noted that the Rockefeller revenue package was essentially dead-on-arrival in both houses of the legislature though parts of the program were enacted piecemeal in the subsequent administration of the Democrat Dale Bumpers. Dumas describes Rockefeller as the \"most liberal governor in Arkansas history\" in light of his attempts to increase taxes to augment the size and scope of state government as well as steadfast support for civil rights and opposition to capital punishment.\n\nDuring this term Rockefeller quietly and successfully completed the integration of Arkansas schools that had been such a political bombshell only a few years before. He established the Council on Human Relations despite opposition from the legislature. Draft boards in the state boasted the highest level of racial integration of any U.S. state by the time that Rockefeller left office.\n\nIn 1970, it was disclosed that Rockefeller had maintained a list of militants for use by law enforcement to prevent potential disorders on Arkansas college and university campuses. The list drew opposition from some of his opponents, including an unsuccessful Democratic primary hopeful, state House Speaker Hayes McClerkin of Texarkana. McClerkin argued that the list may have contained the names of those who merely disagreed with Rockefeller politically.\n\nIn 1970, the Arkansas GOP under Rockefeller hired its first paid executive director, Neal Sox Johnson of Nashville in Howard County. Johnson left the position in 1973 to take a high position with the former Farmers Home Administration in Washington, D.C., and was replaced by Ken Coon, who carried the party's gubernatorial banner in 1974 against David Pryor.\n\nIn the 1970 campaign, Rockefeller expected to face Orval Faubus, who led the old-guard Democrats, but the previously unknown Dale Bumpers of Charleston in Franklin County rose to the top of the Democratic heap by promising reforms. Bumpers' charisma and \"fresh face\" were too much for an incumbent Republican to overcome. Rockefeller lost his third-term bid, but he had inadvertently propelled the Democrats to reform their own party. Maurice Britt managed the 1970 campaign, and he was replaced on the Republican ticket for lieutenant governor by Sterling R. Cockrill of Little Rock, the former Democratic House Speaker in Rockefeller's first term. Cockrill switched parties in the spring of 1970 to make the race; he was defeated by the Democrat Bob C. Riley but finished 35,000 votes ahead of Rockefeller.\n\nReflecting on his defeat, Rockefeller said:\n\nIt has been said by some that I asked for too much. Perhaps so. You tell me -- what quality of leadership would ask too little? What sort of leadership would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long has been so meager for so many? The shame upon me and my administration would have been in not struggling for something better. Today, I am not ashamed ... . The most meaningful measurement of progress is that certain things are no longer acceptable to us as a people.\n\nWith the 1970 elections, the Republicans were reduced to a single member of each legislative chamber, Preston Bynum of Siloam Springs in the House and Jim Caldwell in the Senate. Danny Patrick, elected with Rockefeller in 1966 and 1968, went down to defeat in Madison and Carroll counties at the hands of Stephen A. Smith, who at twenty-one became Arkansas' youngest-ever state legislator, a designation that Patrick himself had taken only four years earlier.\n\nAs a dramatic last act, Governor Rockefeller, a longtime death penalty opponent, commuted the sentences of every prisoner on Arkansas's Death Row and urged the governors of other states to do likewise. Thirty-three years later, in January 2003, Illinois' lame duck governor, George Ryan, would do the same, granting blanket commutations to the 167 inmates then sentenced to death in that state.\n\nBefore he left office, Rockefeller appointed a young public administrator, Jerry Climer, to the vacant post of Pulaski County clerk. Two years later, Climer ran for secretary of state. He later founded two Washington, D.C.-based \"think tanks.\" and left office on January 12, 1971.\n\nIn 1972, Rockefeller persuaded Len E. Blaylock of Perry County, his former welfare commissioner known for expertise in government administration to be the Republican gubernatorial nominee. Blaylock lost to Bumpers by an even greater margin than had Rockefeller in 1970. Rockefeller that year also supported the unsuccessful candidacy of Wayne H. Babbitt, a North Little Rock veterinarian who became the only Republican ever to challenge the reelection of U.S. Senator John L. McClellan.\n\nRockefeller hired as a $300-a-month secretary Judy Petty, who went on to serve two terms in the state legislature and to carry the Republican standard twice in races for Congress.\n\nIn September 1972, Rockefeller was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer and endured a devastating round of chemotherapy. When he returned to Arkansas the populace was shocked at the gaunt and haggard appearance of what had been a giant of a man.\n\nWinthrop Rockefeller died February 22, 1973, in Palm Springs, California, at the age of sixty. His body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Winrock Farms in Morrilton, Arkansas.\n\nThe legacy of Winthrop Rockefeller lives on in the form of numerous charities, scholarships, and the activities of the \"Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation\" and the \"Winthrop Rockefeller Charitable Trust\", including Winrock International, an international nonprofit organization based in Little Rock, Arkansas whose mission is to empower disadvantaged people, increase economic opportunity, and sustain natural resources. The Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation provides funding for projects across Arkansas to encourage economic development, education, and racial and social justice. In 1964, he founded Museum of Automobiles on Petit Jean Mountain, which after his death in 1973 was given to the Arkansas State Parks system; a non-profit organization was formed to run the museum; in March 2007, the Charitable Trust pledged $100,000 for its ongoing operations if the museum raised an equal amount by the end of that year.\n\nRockefeller's political legacy lives on in both the Republican and Democratic parties of Arkansas, both of which were forced to reform as a result of his presence on the state scene.\n\nRockefeller was the subject of the December 2, 1966, cover of \"Time\" magazine.\n\nWinthrop Rockefeller's son and only child, Win, served as Arkansas lieutenant governor, having won a special election in 1996 to succeed Mike Huckabee. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller then won two full four-year terms in 1998 and 2002. Like his father, Win Paul Rockefeller's political career was cut short by a devastating cancer.\n\nThe Winrock Shopping Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is named for Rockefeller. He developed the center in a relationship with the University of New Mexico.\n\nDuring his tenure as chairman of Colonial Williamsburg, Winthrop was a frequent visitor at the foundation's Carter's Grove Plantation eight miles away in James City County, Virginia. He is credited with helping develop a plan with Gussie Busch in the early 1970s to turn a portion of the large tract of undeveloped land between the two points into the massive Anheuser-Busch (AB) investment there, which included building a large brewery, the Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park, the Kingsmill planned resort community, and McLaws Circle, an office park. AB and related entities from that development plan now are the source of the area's largest employment base, surpassing both Colonial Williamsburg and the local military bases.\n\n1964 General Election for Governor\nOrval Faubus (D) (inc.) 57%\nWinthrop Rockefeller (R) 43%\n\n1966 Republican Primary for Governor\nWinthrop Rockefeller 98%\nGus McMillan 2%\n\n1966 General Election for Governor\nWinthrop Rockefeller (R) 54%\nJames D. \"Justice Jim\" Johnson (D) 46%\n\n1968 Republican Primary for Governor\nWinthrop Rockefeller (inc.) 95%\nSidney K.
