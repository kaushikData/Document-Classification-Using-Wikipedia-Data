It is most notable for its curving facade, banded by balconies. Its exterior is beige brick and glass. It is across from a major pedestrian and vehicle entrance into Central Park, known as the \"Merchant's Gate\". This full service building was built post-war in 1963 by Bernard Spitzer and Melvin Lipman. It was designed by Wechsler & Schimenti.

It is no longer the law in most common law jurisdictions today, yet 99-year leases continue to be common as a matter of business practice and conventional wisdom.\n\nUnder the traditional American common law doctrine, the 99-year term was not literal, but merely an arbitrary time span beyond the life expectancy of any possible lessee or lessor.\n\nWilliam Blackstone states that a lease was formerly limited to 40 years, although much longer leases (for 300 years, or 1000 years) were in use by the time of Edward III. The 40-year limit was based on the unreliable text \"The Mirror of Justices\" (book 2, chapter 27).\n\nIn the law of several US states, a 99-year lease will always be the longest possible contract for realty by statute, but many have enacted shorter terms and some allow infinite terms.\n\nDue to the influence of the ideas of Henry George at the time the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was established in the early 20th century, all land in the ACT is held under 99-year leases, the first of which will expire in 2023.\n\nThe 99-year lease concept has been more common under the civil law regimes when it comes to concessions of territory: most concessions last for 99 years.\n\n"}

He is notable for leading the Negros Revolution along with Juan Araneta, and for being the President of the short-lived Republic of Negros.\n\nLacson was the fifth son of seven children of Lucio Petronila Lacson and Clara Ledesma of Iloilo who migrated to Negros when he was still young. His early education began under private tutelage in Molo, Iloilo. He later studied commerce at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where his classmates included future general and comrade Juan Araneta, José Rizal, and other Filipinos who later figured in the Philippine Revolution.\n\nWhile a student in Manila, he had the opportunity to meet the founder of the Katipunan, Andrés Bonifacio, with whom he had a secret blood compact. He was the only Negrense who had this honor and consequently became a member of the revolutionary society.\n\nAniceto first married Rosario Araneta, a direct descendant of the Kabungsuan royal family of Mindanao, daughter of Patricio Cabunsol Araneta and Leoncia Araneta, with whom he sired eleven children. They were: \n\nWith his second wife, Magdalena Torres, he had 10 children. They were:\nManuel Distajo Lacson, Sebastian \nDistajo Lacson, Ma. Corazon Lacson Mirasol, her twin sister Ma.

Asuncion Distajo Lacson who died at age 50 on Nov. 2, 2014.\n\n\nWhen his father became bedridden, Lacson took charge of all the work in the haciendas and did much to improve the properties. As a result, through his efforts his father became one of the richest men in Negros and the Philippines. When the time came to divide his father’s properties his other brothers chose the best haciendas. He, for his part, chose the uncultivated ones. Thus, he received more land from his father than his brothers. Through hard work, he improved all the land and turned it into one of the best producing haciendas in Negros.\n\nIn the later 19th century, a Swiss businessman by the name of Luchinger decided to sell his vast properties in Matabang, Talisay, which he earlier purchased from Nicholas Loney, the biggest sugar cane producer in Negros at that time. It was offered to Aniceto Lacson, but he did not have enough ready cash. Luchinger was willing to sell it on installment but Aniceto’s father Lucio refused as the venture appeared risky. Aniceto negotiated with Luchinger to agree to sell it to him without guarantor. Knowing that Aniceto was hardworking, honest and followed through with his business commitments, Luchinger agreed.\n\nHis home in Talisay City, Negros Occidental is owned by his descendants the Claparols family.\n\nThe Spanish Governor of Negros Island, Isidro Castro, surrendered to forces under Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta at Bacolod on 6 Nov. 1898. The Cantonal Republic of Negros was established with Aniceto Lacson as its President from November 27, 1898 until March 4, 1899 when the Negros revolutionaries surrendered to the United States General James Francis Smith.

He also served as the 41st Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia from 1916 to 1919. Candler Field, the site of the present-day Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, was named after him, as is Candler Park in Atlanta.\n\nCandler was born on December 30, 1851 in Villa Rica, Georgia. His father was Samuel Charles Candler.\n\nIn 1906 he completed Atlanta's then-tallest building, the Candler Building, whose intricately detailed 17 stories still stands at Peachtree and Auburn. In 1912 the Candler Building in New York opened.\n\nCandler was elected mayor of Atlanta in 1916 (taking office in 1917) and ended his day-to-day management of the Coca-Cola Company. As mayor he balanced the city budget and coordinated rebuilding efforts after the Great Atlanta fire of 1917 destroyed 1,500 homes. In 1919 he gave most of the stock in The Coca-Cola Company to his children, who later sold it to a group of investors led by Ernest Woodruff. In 1922 he donated over of his Druid Hills holdings to the City of Atlanta for what became Candler Park.\n\nAsa Candler suffered a stroke in 1926 and died on March 12, 1929 at Wesley Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. He is buried at Westview Cemetery in southwest Atlanta.\n\nThe Candler Field Museum in Williamson, Georgia, has been established to commemorate the original \"Candler Field\" Atlanta airport.\n\nThe \"Candler Building\" on the northeast corner of East Pratt Street and Market Place in eastern downtown Baltimore, still retains his name. The brick industrial styled building faces the waterfront of the \"Basin\" (later the famed \"Inner Harbor\"), of the Baltimore Harbor on the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River. Used as a regional headquarters for the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, the structure was known for having brass door knobs engraved with \"CC\" for the company. Between the late 1930s and 1960, the building served as the national headquarters of the new Social Security Administration, authorized under the \"Social Security Act\" of 1935, under the \"New Deal\" programs of the administration of 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1960, the SSA moved to larger suburban campus in western Baltimore County at Woodlawn, off the then under-construction \"Baltimore Beltway\" of Interstate 695.\n\nBy the 2000s as the old waterfront area and municipal piers area were being redeveloped from commercial and industrial uses, the Candler Building was renovated for offices and some apartments/condos, with the nearby \"Power Plant Live!\" development of the David Cordish Company (of famed national commercial developer David S. Cordish), from the old massive streetcar coal-burning power-generating plant from 1900, across the street, into an entertainment and retail destination and district, where the former old Centre Market (also known as \"Marsh Market\" for the ancient colonial Harrison's Marsh on the site), with its three neighboring buildings for wholesale fish, produce, and dry goods, the oldest of the city's eleven municipal market houses, since the 1760s.\n\nAsa Candler was also a philanthropist, endowing numerous schools and universities as well as the Candler Hospital in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nCallan Castle, the Candler home in Inman Park, built from 1902 to 1904, still stands as a private home.\n\nHis later mansion at 1500 Ponce de Leon Avenue, Druid Hills, built in 1916 eventually became John Chrysostom Melkite Greek Catholic Church.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5224", "title": "Citizen Kane", "text": "Citizen Kane\n\nCitizen Kane is a 1941 American mystery drama film by Orson Welles, its producer, co-screenwriter, director and star. The picture was Welles's first feature film. Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the greatest film ever made, \"Citizen Kane\" was voted as such in five consecutive British Film Institute \"Sight & Sound\" polls of critics, and it topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in 1998, as well as its 2007 update. \"Citizen Kane\" is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, editing and narrative structure, which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting.\n\nThe quasi-biographical film examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnates William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, and aspects of the screenwriters' own lives. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story is told through the research of a newsreel reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: \"Rosebud\".\n\nAfter the Broadway successes of Welles's Mercury Theatre and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast \"The War of the Worlds\" on \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939. Unusually for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have final cut privilege. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the screenplay for \"Citizen Kane\", collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in 1941.\n\nWhile a critical success, \"Citizen Kane\" failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release, but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as André Bazin and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on Blu-ray on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.\n\nIn a mansion in Xanadu, a vast palatial estate in Florida, the elderly Charles Foster Kane is on his deathbed. Holding a snow globe, he utters a word, \"Rosebud\", and dies; the globe slips from his hand and smashes on the floor. A newsreel obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of \"Rosebud\".\n\nThompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He tries to approach Susan Alexander Kane, now an alcoholic who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns that Kane's childhood began in poverty in Colorado.\n\nIn 1871, after a gold mine is discovered on her property, Kane's mother Mary Kane sends Charles away to live with Thatcher so that he would be properly educated. It is also implied that Kane's father could be violent towards his son and that is another reason she wants to send him away. While Thatcher and Charles' parents discuss arrangements inside, the young Kane plays happily with a sled in the snow outside his parents' boarding-house and protests being sent to live with Thatcher. Furious at the prospect of exile from his own family to live with a man he does not know, the boy strikes Thatcher with his sled and attempts to run away.\n\nYears later, after gaining full control over his trust fund at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business and embarks on a career of yellow journalism. He takes control of the \"New York Inquirer\" and starts publishing scandalous articles that attack Thatcher's business interests. After the stock market crash in 1929, Kane is forced to sell controlling interest of his newspaper empire to Thatcher.\n\nBack in the present, Thompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls how Kane hired the best journalists available to build the \"Inquirer\"s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the Spanish–American War and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of a President of the United States.\n\nThompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a retirement home. Leland recalls how Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrates more and more over the years, and he begins an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while he is running for Governor of New York. Both his wife and his political opponent discover the affair and the public scandal ends his political career. Kane marries Susan and forces her into a humiliating operatic career for which she has neither the talent nor the ambition.\n\nBack in the present, Susan now consents to an interview with Thompson and recalls her failed opera career. Kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts suicide. After years spent dominated by Kane and living in isolation at Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan leaves him, Kane begins violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. He suddenly calms down when he sees a snow globe and says, \"Rosebud\".\n\nBack at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are being cataloged or discarded. Thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word will forever remain an enigma. As the film ends, the camera reveals that \"Rosebud\" is the trade name of the sled on which the eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado. Thought to be junk by Xanadu's staff, the sled is burned in a furnace.\n\nThe beginning of the film's ending credits state that \"Most of the principal actors in \"Citizen Kane\" are new to motion pictures. The Mercury Theatre is proud to introduce them.\" The cast is listed in the following order:\n\n\nAdditionally, Charles Bennett appears as the entertainer at the head of the chorus line in the \"Inquirer\" party sequence, and cinematographer Gregg Toland makes a cameo appearance as an interviewer depicted in part of the \"News on the March\" newsreel. Actor Alan Ladd makes a cameo appearance as a reporter smoking a pipe at the end of the film.\n\nHollywood had shown interest in Welles as early as 1936. He turned down three scripts sent to him by Warner Bros. In 1937, he declined offers from David O. Selznick, who asked him to head his film company's story department, and William Wyler, who wanted him for a supporting role in \"Wuthering Heights\". \"Although the possibility of making huge amounts of money in Hollywood greatly attracted him,\" wrote biographer Frank Brady, \"he was still totally, hopelessly, insanely in love with the theater, and it is there that he had every intention of remaining to make his mark.\"\n\nFollowing \"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast of his CBS radio series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", Welles was lured to Hollywood with a remarkable contract. RKO Pictures studio head George J. Schaefer wanted to work with Welles after the notorious broadcast, believing that Welles had a gift for attracting mass attention. RKO was also uncharacteristically profitable and was entering into a series of independent production contracts that would add more artistically prestigious films to its roster. Throughout the spring and early summer of 1939, Schaefer constantly tried to lure the reluctant Welles to Hollywood. Welles was in financial trouble after failure of his plays \"Five Kings\" and \"The Green Goddess\". At first he simply wanted to spend three months in Hollywood and earn enough money to pay his debts and fund his next theatrical season. Welles first arrived on July 20, 1939 and on his first tour, he called the movie studio \"the greatest electric train set a boy ever had\".\n\nWelles signed his contract with RKO on August 21. This legendary contract stipulated that Welles would act in, direct, produce and write two films. Mercury would get $100,000 for the first film by January 1, 1940, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000, and $125,000 for a second film by January 1, 1941, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000. The most controversial aspect of the contract was granting Welles complete artistic control of the two films so long as RKO approved both project's stories and so long as the budget did not exceed $500,000. RKO executives would not be allowed to see any footage until Welles chose to show it to them, and no cuts could be made to either film without Welles's approval. Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, select his own cast and crew, and have the right of final cut. Granting final cut privilege was unprecedented for a studio since it placed artistic considerations over financial investment. The contract was deeply resented in the film industry, and the Hollywood press took every opportunity to mock RKO and Welles. Schaefer remained a great supporter and saw the unprecedented contract as good publicity. Film scholar Robert L. Carringer wrote: \"The simple fact seems to be that Schaefer believed Welles was going to pull off something really big almost as much as Welles did himself.\"\nWelles spent the first five months of his RKO contract trying to get his first project going, without success. \"They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there,\" wrote \"The Hollywood Reporter\". It was agreed that Welles would film \"Heart of Darkness\", previously adapted for \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", which would be presented entirely through a first-person camera. After elaborate pre-production and a day of test shooting with a hand-held camera—unheard of at the time—the project never reached production because Welles was unable to trim $50,000 from its budget. Schaefer told Welles that the $500,000 budget could not be exceeded; as war loomed, revenue was declining sharply in Europe by the fall of 1939.\n\nHe then started work on the idea that became \"Citizen Kane\". Knowing the script would take time to prepare, Welles suggested to RKO that while that was being done—\"so the year wouldn't be lost\"—he make a humorous political thriller. Welles proposed \"The Smiler with a Knife\", from a novel by Cecil Day-Lewis. When that project stalled in December 1939, Welles began brainstorming other story ideas with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who had been writing Mercury radio scripts. \"Arguing, inventing, discarding, these two powerful, headstrong, dazzlingly articulate personalities thrashed toward \"Kane\"\", wrote biographer Richard Meryman.\n\nOne of the long-standing controversies about \"Citizen Kane\" has been the authorship of the screenplay. Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for Welles's CBS Radio series, \"The Campbell Playhouse\". Mankiewicz based the original outline on the life of William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.\n\nIn February 1940 Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first draft screenplay under the supervision of John Houseman, Welles's former partner in the Mercury Theatre. Welles later explained, \"I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine.\" Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, \"At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own.\"\n\nThe terms of the contract stated that Mankiewicz was to receive no credit for his work, as he was hired as a script doctor. Before he signed the contract Mankiewicz was particularly advised by his agents that all credit for his work belonged to Welles and the Mercury Theatre, the \"author and creator\". As the film neared release, however, Mankiewicz began threatening Welles to get credit for the film—including threats to place full-page ads in trade papers and to get his friend Ben Hecht to write an exposé for \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Mankiewicz also threatened to go to the Screen Writers Guild and claim full credit for writing the entire script by himself.\n\nAfter lodging a protest with the Screen Writers Guild, Mankiewicz withdrew it, then vacillated. The question was resolved in January 1941 when the studio, RKO Pictures, awarded Mankiewicz credit. The guild credit form listed Welles first, Mankiewicz second. Welles's assistant Richard Wilson said that the person who circled Mankiewicz's name in pencil, then drew an arrow that put it in first place, was Welles. The official credit reads, \"Screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles\". Mankiewicz's rancor toward Welles grew over the remaining 12 years of his life.\n\nQuestions over the authorship of the \"Citizen Kane\" screenplay were revived in 1971 by influential film critic Pauline Kael, whose controversial 50,000-word essay \"Raising Kane\" was commissioned as an introduction to the shooting script in \"The Citizen Kane Book\", published in October 1971. The book-length essay first appeared in February 1971, in two consecutive issues of \"The New Yorker\" magazine.\nIn the ensuing controversy Welles was defended by colleagues, critics, biographers and scholars, but his reputation was damaged by its charges. The essay was later discredited and Kael's own scholarship was called into question.\n\nAny question of authorship was resolved with Carringer's 1978 essay, \"The Scripts of Citizen Kane\". Carringer studied the collection of script records—\"almost a day-to-day record of the history of the scripting\"—that was then still intact at RKO. He reviewed all seven drafts and concluded that \"the full evidence reveals that Welles's contribution to the \"Citizen Kane\" script was not only substantial but definitive.\"\n\nWelles never confirmed a principal source for the character of Charles Foster Kane. Houseman wrote that Kane is a synthesis of different personalities, with Hearst's life used as the main source. Some events and details were invented, and Houseman wrote that he and Mankiewicz also \"grafted anecdotes from other giants of journalism, including Pulitzer, Northcliffe and Mank's first boss, Herbert Bayard Swope.\" Welles said, \"Mr. Hearst was quite a bit like Kane, although Kane isn't really founded on Hearst in particular. Many people sat for it, so to speak\". He specifically acknowledged that aspects of Kane were drawn from the lives of two business tycoons familiar from his youth in Chicago—Samuel Insull and Harold Fowler McCormick.\n\nThe character of Jedediah Leland was based on drama critic Ashton Stevens, George Stevens's uncle and Welles's close boyhood friend. Some detail came from Mankiewicz's own experience as a drama critic in New York.\n\nThe assumption that the character of Susan Alexander Kane was based on Marion Davies was a major reason Hearst tried to destroy \"Citizen Kane\". Welles denied that the character was based on Davies, whom he called \"an extraordinary woman—nothing like the character Dorothy Comingore played in the movie.\" He cited Insull's building of the Chicago Opera House, and McCormick's lavish promotion of the opera career of his second wife, Ganna Walska, as direct influences on the screenplay.\n\nThe character of political boss Jim W. Gettys is based on Charles F. Murphy, a leader in New York City's infamous Tammany Hall political machine.\n\nWelles credited \"Rosebud\" to Mankiewicz. Biographer Richard Meryman wrote that the symbol of Mankiewicz's own damaged childhood was a treasured bicycle, stolen while he visited the public library and not replaced by his family as punishment. He regarded it as the prototype of Charles Foster Kane's sled. In his 2015 Welles biography, Patrick McGilligan reported that Mankiewicz himself stated that the word \"Rosebud\" was taken from the name of a famous racehorse, Old Rosebud. Mankiewicz had a bet on the horse in the 1914 Kentucky Derby, which he won, and McGilligan wrote that \"Old Rosebud symbolized his lost youth, and the break with his family\". In testimony for the Lundberg suit, Mankiewicz said, \"I had undergone psycho-analysis, and Rosebud, under circumstances slightly resembling the circumstances in [\"Citizen Kane\"], played a prominent part.\" Other modern claims that the term was a nickname Hearst used for Davies' clitoris were rejected by Houseman and dismissed by Brady.\n\nThe \"News on the March\" sequence that begins the film satirizes the journalistic style of \"The March of Time\", the news documentary and dramatization series presented in movie theaters by Time Inc. From 1935 to 1938 Welles was a member of the uncredited company of actors that presented the original radio version.\n\nHouseman claimed that banker Walter P. Thatcher was loosely based on J. P. Morgan. Bernstein was named for Dr. Maurice Bernstein, appointed Welles's guardian; Sloane's portrayal was said to be based on Bernard Herrmann. Herbert Carter, editor of \"The Inquirer\", was named for actor Jack Carter.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" was a rare film in that its principal roles were played by actors new to motion pictures. Ten were billed as Mercury Actors, members of the skilled repertory company assembled by Welles for the stage and radio performances of the Mercury Theatre, an independent theater company he founded with Houseman in 1937. \"He loved to use the Mercury players,\" wrote biographer Charles Higham, \"and consequently he launched several of them on movie careers.\"\n\nThe film represents the feature film debuts of William Alland, Ray Collins, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Erskine Sanford, Everett Sloane, Paul Stewart, and Welles himself. Despite never having appeared in feature films, some of the cast members were already well known to the public. Cotten had recently become a Broadway star in the hit play \"The Philadelphia Story\" with Katharine Hepburn and Sloane was well known for his role on the radio show \"The Goldbergs\". Mercury actor George Coulouris was a star of the stage in New York and London.\n\nNot all of the cast came from the Mercury Players. Welles cast Dorothy Comingore, an actress who played supporting parts in films since 1934 using the name \"Linda Winters\", as Susan Alexander Kane. A discovery of Charlie Chaplin, Comingore was recommended to Welles by Chaplin, who then met Comingore at a party in Los Angeles and immediately cast her.\n\nWelles had met stage actress Ruth Warrick while visiting New York on a break from Hollywood and remembered her as a good fit for Emily Norton Kane, later saying that she looked the part. Warrick told Carringer that she was struck by the extraordinary resemblance between herself and Welles's mother when she saw a photograph of Beatrice Ives Welles. She characterized her own personal relationship with Welles as motherly.\n\n\"He trained us for films at the same time that he was training himself,\" recalled Agnes Moorehead. \"Orson believed in good acting, and he realized that rehearsals were needed to get the most from his actors. That was something new in Hollywood: nobody seemed interested in bringing in a group to rehearse before scenes were shot. But Orson knew it was necessary, and we rehearsed every sequence before it was shot.\"\n\nWhen \"The March of Time\" narrator Westbrook Van Voorhis asked for $25,000 to narrate the \"News on the March\" sequence, Alland demonstrated his ability to imitate Van Voorhis and Welles cast him.\n\nWelles later said that casting character actor Gino Corrado in the small part of the waiter at the El Rancho broke his heart. Corrado had appeared in many Hollywood films, often as a waiter, and Welles wanted all of the actors to be new to films.\n\nOther uncredited roles went to Thomas A. Curran as Teddy Roosevelt in the faux newsreel; Richard Baer as Hillman, a man at Madison Square Garden, and a man in the \"News on the March\" screening room; and Alan Ladd, Arthur O'Connell and Louise Currie as reporters at Xanadu.\n\nWhen Kathryn Trosper Popper died on March 6, 2016, at the age of 100 she was reported to be the last surviving actor to appear in \"Citizen Kane\". Jean Forward, a soprano who dubbed the singing voice of Susan Alexander, was the last surviving performer from the film before her death in 2016. Warrick was the last surviving member of the principal cast at the time of her death in 2005. Sonny Bupp, who played Kane's young son, was the last surviving credited cast member of \"Citizen Kane\" when he died in 2007.\n\nProduction advisor Miriam Geiger quickly compiled a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully. He then taught himself filmmaking by matching its visual vocabulary to \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", which he ordered from the Museum of Modern Art, and films by Frank Capra, René Clair, Fritz Lang, King Vidor and Jean Renoir. The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's \"Stagecoach\", which he watched 40 times. \"As it turned out, the first day I ever walked onto a set was my first day as a director,\" Welles said. \"I'd learned whatever I knew in the projection room—from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I'd run \"Stagecoach\", often with some different technician or department head from the studio, and ask questions. 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school.\"\n\nWelles's cinematographer for the film was Gregg Toland, described by Welles as \"just then, the number-one cameraman in the world.\" To Welles's astonishment, Toland visited him at his office and said, \"I want you to use me on your picture.\" He had seen some of the Mercury stage productions (including \"Caesar\") and said he wanted to work with someone who had never made a movie. RKO hired Toland on loan from Samuel Goldwyn Productions in the first week of June 1940.\n\n\"And he never tried to impress us that he was doing any miracles,\" Welles recalled. \"I was calling for things only a beginner would have been ignorant enough to think anybody could ever do, and there he was, \"doing\" them.\" Toland later explained that he wanted to work with Welles because he anticipated the first-time director's inexperience and reputation for audacious experimentation in the theater would allow the cinematographer to try new and innovative camera techniques that typical Hollywood films would never have allowed him to do. Unaware of filmmaking protocol, Welles adjusted the lights on set as he was accustomed to doing in the theater; Toland quietly re-balanced them, and was angry when one of the crew informed Welles that he was infringing on Toland's responsibilities. During the first few weeks of June, Welles had lengthy discussions about the film with Toland and art director Perry Ferguson in the morning, and in the afternoon and evening he worked with actors and revised the script.\nOn June 29, 1940—a Saturday morning when few inquisitive studio executives would be around—Welles began filming \"Citizen Kane\". After the disappointment of having \"Heart of Darkness\" cancelled, Welles followed Ferguson's suggestion and deceived RKO into believing that he was simply shooting camera tests. \"But we were shooting the \"picture\",\" Welles said, \"because we wanted to get started and be already into it before anybody knew about it.\"\n\nAt the time RKO executives were pressuring him to agree to direct a film called \"The Men from Mars\", to capitalize on \"The War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast. Welles said that he would consider making the project but wanted to make a different film first. At this time he did not inform them that he had already begun filming \"Citizen Kane.\"\n\nThe early footage was called \"Orson Welles Tests\" on all paperwork. The first \"test\" shot was the \"News on the March\" projection room scene, economically filmed in a real studio projection room in darkness that masked many actors who appeared in other roles later in the film. \"At $809 Orson did run substantially beyond the test budget of $528—to create one of the most famous scenes in movie history,\" wrote Barton Whaley.\n\nThe next scenes were the El Rancho nightclub scenes and the scene in which Susan attempts suicide. Welles later said that the nightclub set was available after another film had wrapped and that filming took 10 to 12 days to complete. For these scenes Welles had Comingore's throat sprayed with chemicals to give her voice a harsh, raspy tone. Other scenes shot in secret included those in which Thompson interviews Leland and Bernstein, which were also shot on sets built for other films.\n\nDuring production, the film was referred to as \"RKO 281\". Most of the filming took place in what is now Stage 19 on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood. There was some location filming at Balboa Park in San Diego and the San Diego Zoo.\n\nIn the end of July, RKO approved the film and Welles was allowed to officially begin shooting, despite having already been filming \"tests\" for several weeks. Welles leaked stories to newspaper reporters that the tests had been so good that there was no need to re-shoot them. The first official scene to be shot was the breakfast montage sequence between Kane and his first wife Emily. To strategically save money and appease the RKO executives who opposed him, Welles rehearsed scenes extensively before actually shooting and filmed very few takes of each shot set-up. Welles never shot master shots for any scene after Toland told him that Ford never shot them. To appease the increasingly curious press, Welles threw a cocktail party for selected reporters, promising that they could watch a scene being filmed. When the journalists arrived Welles told them they had \"just finished\" shooting for the day but still had the party. Welles told the press that he was ahead of schedule (without factoring in the month of \"test shooting\"), thus discrediting claims that after a year in Hollywood without making a film he was a failure in the film industry.\nWelles usually worked 16 to 18 hours a day on the film. He often began work at 4 a.m. since the special effects make-up used to age him for certain scenes took up to four hours to apply. Welles used this time to discuss the day's shooting with Toland and other crew members. The special contact lenses used to make Welles look elderly proved very painful, and a doctor was employed to place them into Welles's eyes. Welles had difficulty seeing clearly while wearing them, which caused him to badly cut his wrist when shooting the scene in which Kane breaks up the furniture in Susan's bedroom. While shooting the scene in which Kane shouts at Gettys on the stairs of Susan Alexander's apartment building, Welles fell ten feet; an X-ray revealed two bone chips in his ankle. The injury required him to direct the film from a wheelchair for two weeks. He eventually wore a steel brace to resume performing on camera; it is visible in the low-angle scene between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. For the final scene, a stage at the Selznick studio was equipped with a working furnace, and multiple takes were required to show the sled being put into the fire and the word \"Rosebud\" consumed. Paul Stewart recalled that on the ninth take the Culver City Fire Department arrived in full gear because the furnace had grown so hot the flue caught fire. \"Orson was delighted with the commotion\", he said.\n\nWhen \"Rosebud\" was burned, Welles choreographed the scene while he had composer Bernard Herrmann's cue playing on the set.\n\nUnlike Schaefer, many members of RKO's board of governors did not like Welles or the control that his contract gave him. However such board members as Nelson Rockefeller and NBC chief David Sarnoff were sympathetic to Welles. Throughout production Welles had problems with these executives not respecting his contract's stipulation of non-interference and several spies arrived on set to report what they saw to the executives. When the executives would sometimes arrive on set unannounced the entire cast and crew would suddenly start playing softball until they left. Before official shooting began the executives intercepted all copies of the script and delayed their delivery to Welles. They had one copy sent to their office in New York, resulting in it being leaked to press.\n\nPrincipal shooting wrapped October 24. Welles then took several weeks off of the film for a lecture tour, during which he also scouted additional locations with Toland and Ferguson. Filming resumed November 15 with some re-shoots. Toland had to leave due to a commitment to shoot Howard Hughes' \"The Outlaw\", but Toland's camera crew continued working on the film and Toland was replaced by RKO cinematographer Harry J. Wild. The final day of shooting on November 30 was Kane's death scene. Welles boasted that he only went 21 days over his official shooting schedule, without factoring in the month of \"camera tests.\" According to RKO records, the film cost $839,727. Its estimated budget had been $723,800.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" was edited by Robert Wise and assistant editor Mark Robson. Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the \"camera tests\" and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles \"had an older editor assigned to him for those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits.\" Wise and Robson began editing the film while it was still shooting and said that they \"could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out.\" Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing. The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow dissolves. The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film \"in camera\" by leaving few options of how it could be put together. Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct \"timing\" and \"rhythm\" for the whip pans and overlapping dialogue. The \"News on the March\" sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity. They used stock footage from Pathé News and the General Film Library.\n\nDuring post-production Welles and special effects artist Linwood G. Dunn experimented with an optical printer to improve certain scenes that Welles found unsatisfactory from the footage. Whereas Welles was often immediately pleased with Wise's work, he would require Dunn and post-production audio engineer James G. Stewart to re-do their work several times until he was satisfied.\n\nWelles hired Bernard Herrmann to compose the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in as few as two or three weeks after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had sufficient time to do his own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces for some of the montages, and Welles edited many of the scenes to match their length.\n\nWritten and directed by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the theatrical trailer for \"Citizen Kane\" differs from other trailers in that it did not feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-documentary piece on the film's production. Filmed at the same time as \"Citizen Kane\" itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character. The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of Everett Sloane appearing at first to be running into the camera, which turns out to be the reflection of the camera in a mirror.\n\nAt the time, it was almost unprecedented for a film trailer to not actually feature anything of the film itself; and while \"Citizen Kane\" is frequently cited as a groundbreaking, influential film, Simon Callow argues its trailer was no less original in its approach. Callow writes that it has \"great playful charm ... it is a miniature documentary, almost an introduction to the cinema ... Teasing, charming, completely original, it is a sort of conjuring trick: Without his face appearing once on the screen, Welles entirely dominates its five [sic] minutes' duration.\"\n\nFilm scholars and historians view \"Citizen Kane\" as Welles's attempt to create a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of it and combining them into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started working on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, \"Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you know something about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful.\"\n\nDavid Bordwell wrote that \"The best way to understand \"Citizen Kane\" is to stop worshiping it as a triumph of technique.\" Bordwell argues that the film did not invent any of its famous techniques such as deep focus cinematography, shots of the ceilings, chiaroscuro lighting and temporal jump-cuts, and that many of these stylistics had been used in German Expressionist films of the 1920s, such as \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\". But Bordwell asserts that the film did put them all together for the first time and perfected the medium in one single film. In a 1948 interview, D. W. Griffith said, \"I loved \"Citizen Kane\" and particularly loved the ideas he took from me.\"\n\nArguments against the film's cinematic innovations were made as early as 1946 when French historian Georges Sadoul wrote, \"The film is an encyclopedia of old techniques.\" He pointed out such examples as compositions that used both the foreground and the background in the films of Auguste and Louis Lumière, special effects used in the films of Georges Méliès, shots of the ceiling in Erich von Stroheim's \"Greed\" and newsreel montages in the films of Dziga Vertov.\n\nFrench film critic André Bazin defended the film, writing: \"In this respect, the accusation of plagiarism could very well be extended to the film's use of panchromatic film or its exploitation of the properties of gelatinous silver halide.\" Bazin disagreed with Sadoul's comparison to Lumière's cinematography since \"Citizen Kane\" used more sophisticated lenses, but acknowledged that it had similarities to such previous works as \"The 49th Parallel\" and \"The Power and the Glory\". Bazin stated that \"even if Welles did not invent the cinematic devices employed in \"Citizen Kane\", one should nevertheless credit him with the invention of their \"meaning\".\" Bazin championed the techniques in the film for its depiction of heightened reality, but Bordwell believed that the film's use of special effects contradicted some of Bazin's theories.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" eschews the traditional linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using different points of view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses with the idea of a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.\n\nThe technique of using flashbacks had been used in earlier films—most notably in \"The Power and the Glory\" (1933)—but no film was as immersed in this technique as \"Citizen Kane\". The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.\n\nAt that time films typically had an \"omniscient perspective\", which Marilyn Fabe says give the audience the \"illusion that we are looking with impunity into a world which is unaware of our gaze, Hollywood movies give us a feeling of power.\" The film begins in this fashion up until the \"News on the March\" sequence, after which we the audience see the film through the perspectives of others. The \"News on the March\" sequence gives an overview of Kane's entire life (and the film's entire story) at the beginning of the film, leaving the audience without the typical suspense of wondering how it will end. Instead the film's repetitions of events compels the audience to analyze and wonder why Kane's life happened the way that it did, under the pretext of finding out what \"Rosebud\" means. The film then returns to the omniscient perspective in the final scene, when only the audience discovers what \"Rosebud\" is.\n\nThe most innovative technical aspect of \"Citizen Kane\" is the extended use of deep focus. In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. Cinematographer Toland did this through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Toland described the achievement, made possible by the sensitivity of modern speed film, in an article for \"Theatre Arts\" magazine:\n\nNew developments in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced stage of the game but periodically one is perfected to make this a greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed \"Pan-focus\", as I have been active for two years in its development and used it for the first time in \"Citizen Kane\". Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.\n\nBoth this article and a May 1941 \"Life\" magazine article with illustrated examples helped popularize deep focus cinematography and Toland's achievements on the film.\n\nAnother unorthodox method used in the film was the way low-angle shots were used to display a point of view facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes. Breaking with studio convention, every set was built with a ceiling—many constructed of fabric that ingeniously concealed microphones. Welles felt that the camera should show what the eyes see, and that it was a bad theatrical convention to pretend there was no ceiling—\"a big lie in order to get all those terrible lights up there,\" he said. He became fascinated with the look of low angles, which made even dull interiors look interesting. One extremely low angle is used to photograph the encounter between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. A hole was dug for the camera, which required drilling into the concrete floor.\n\nWelles credited Toland on the same title card as himself and said \"It's impossible to say how much I owe to Gregg. He was superb.\" He called Toland \"the best director of photography that ever existed.\"\n\n\"Citizen Kane\"s sound was recorded by Bailey Fesler and re-recorded in post-production by audio engineer James G. Stewart, both of whom had worked in radio. Stewart said that Hollywood films never deviated from a basic pattern of how sound could be recorded or used, but with Welles \"deviation from the pattern was possible because he demanded it.\" Although the film is known for its complex soundtrack, much of the audio is heard as it was recorded by Fesler and without manipulation.\n\nWelles used techniques from radio like overlapping dialogue. The scene in which characters sing \"Oh, Mr. Kane\" was especially complicated and required mixing several soundtracks together. He also used different \"sound perspectives\" to create the illusion of distances, such as in scenes at Xanadu where characters speak to each other at far distances. Welles experimented with sound in post-production, creating audio montages, and chose to create all of the sound effects for the film instead of using RKO's library of sound effects.\n\nWelles used an aural technique from radio called the \"lightning-mix\". Welles used this technique to link complex montage sequences via a series of related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows from a child into a young man in just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps to a shot of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene. The film's sound cost $16,996, but was originally budgeted at $7,288.\n\nFilm critic and director François Truffaut wrote that \"Before \"Kane\", nobody in Hollywood knew how to set music properly in movies. \"Kane\" was the first, in fact the only, great film that uses radio techniques. ... A lot of filmmakers know enough to follow Auguste Renoir's advice to fill the eyes with images at all costs, but only Orson Welles understood that the sound track had to be filled in the same way.\" Cedric Belfrage of \"The Clipper\" wrote \"of all of the delectable flavours that linger on the palate after seeing \"Kane\", the use of sound is the strongest.\"\n\nThe make-up for \"Citizen Kane\" was created and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior member of the RKO make-up department. Seiderman's family came to the United States from Russia in 1920, escaping persecution. As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the Moscow Art Theatre, where his father was a wigmaker and make-up artist. In New York his uncle was a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union. He worked on Max Reinhardt's 1924 production of \"The Miracle\" and with the Yiddish Art Theatre, and he studied the human figure at the Art Students League of New York. After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by Max Factor and then by RKO. Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.\n\n\"Apprentices were not supposed to make up any principals, only extras, and an apprentice could not be on a set without a journeyman present,\" wrote make-up artist Dick Smith, who became friends with Seiderman in 1979. \"During his years at RKO I suspect these rules were probably overlooked often.\" By 1940 Seiderman's uncredited film work included \"Winterset\", \"Gunga Din\", \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", \"Swiss Family Robinson\" and \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\". \"Seiderman had gained a reputation as one of the most inventive and creatively precise up-and-coming makeup men in Hollywood,\" wrote biographer Frank Brady.\n\nOn an early tour of RKO, Welles met Seiderman in the small make-up lab he created for himself in an unused dressing room. \"Welles fastened on to him at once,\" wrote biographer Charles Higham. \"With his great knowledge of makeup—indeed, his obsession with it, for he hated his flat nose—Welles was fascinated ... Seiderman had an intimate knowledge of anatomy and the process of aging and was acquainted with every line, wrinkle and accretion of fat in aging men and women. Impatient with most makeup methods of his era, he used casts of his subjects in order to develop makeup methods that ensured complete naturalness of expression—a naturalness unrivaled in Hollywood.\"\n\n\"When \"Kane\" came out in script form, Orson told all of us about the picture and said that the most important aspect was the makeup,\" Seiderman recalled. \"I felt that I was being given an assignment that was unique—so I worked accordingly. And there was a lot of work to do. Straight makeups were done in the makeup department by staff, but all the trick stuff and the principal characters were my personal work; nobody else ever touched them. They could not have handled it.\"\n\nSeiderman developed a thorough plan for aging the principal characters, first making a plaster cast of the face of each of the actors who aged, except Joseph Cotten who was unavailable at that time. He made a plaster mold of Welles's body down to the hips.\n\n\"My sculptural techniques for the characters' aging were handled by adding pieces of white modeling clay, which matched the plaster, onto the surface of each bust,\" Seiderman told visual arts historian Norman Gambill. When Seiderman achieved the desired effect he cast the clay pieces in a soft plastic material that he formulated himself. These appliances were then placed onto the plaster bust and a four-piece mold was made for each phase of aging. The castings were then fully painted and paired with the appropriate wig for evaluation.\n\nBefore the actors went before the cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied directly to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically. The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound; Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out his cheeks during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, \"I am acting the part of a nice old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains.\" Seiderman replied, \"You'd be surprised at what the camera doesn't see unless we place it within its view. How about some more coffee?\"\n\nThe red ground resulted in a warmth of tone that was picked up by the sensitive panchromatic film. Over that was applied liquid greasepaint, and then finally a colorless translucent talcum. Seiderman created the effect of skin pores on Kane's face by stippling the surface with a negative cast he made from an orange peel.\n\nWelles was just as heavily made up as young Kane as he was for old Kane, and he often arrived on the set at 2:30 a.m. Application of the sculptural make-up for the oldest incarnation of the character took three-and-a-half hours. The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast and stomach. \"In the film and production photographs, you can see that Kane had a belly that overhung,\" Seiderman said. \"That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. You could see how Kane's silk shirt clung wetly to the character's body. It could not have been done any other way.\"\n\nSeiderman worked with Charles Wright on the wigs. These went over a flexible skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread. When he found the wigs too full he untied one hair at a time to alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture.\n\nSeiderman made scleral lenses for Welles, Dorothy Comingore, George Coulouris and Everett Sloane, to dull the brightness of their young eyes. The lenses took a long time to fit properly, and Seiderman began work on them before devising any of the other makeup. \"I painted them to age in phases, ending with the blood vessels and the \"Aurora Senilis\" of old age.\"\n\n\"Cotten was the only principal for whom I had not made any sculptural casts, wigs or lenses,\" Seiderman said. When Cotten's old-age scenes needed to be shot out of sequence due to Welles's injured ankle, Seiderman improvised with appliances made for Kane's make-up. A sun visor was chosen to conceal Cotten's low hairline and the lenses he wore—hastily supplied by a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist—were uncomfortable.\nSeiderman's tour de force, the breakfast montage, was shot all in one day. \"Twelve years, two years shot at each scene,\" he said. \"Please realize, by the way, that a two-year jump in age is a bit harder to accomplish visually than one of 20 years.\"\n\nAs they did with art direction, the major studios gave screen credit for make-up to only the department head. When RKO make-up department head Mel Berns refused to share credit with Seiderman, who was only an apprentice, Welles told Berns that there would be no make-up credit. Welles signed a large advertisement in the Los Angeles newspaper:\n\nTHANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO GETS SCREEN CREDIT FOR \"CITIZEN KANE\"<br>AND THANKS TO THOSE WHO DON'T<br>TO ALL THE ACTORS, THE CREW, THE OFFICE, THE MUSICIANS, EVERYBODY<br>AND PARTICULARLY TO MAURICE SEIDERMAN, THE BEST MAKE-UP MAN IN THE WORLD\n\n\"To put this event in context, remember that I was a very low man,\" Seiderman recalled. \"I wasn't even called a make-up man. I had started their laboratory and developed their plastic appliances for make-up. But my salary was $25 a week. And I had no union card.\"\n\nSeiderman told Gambill that after \"Citizen Kane\" was released, Welles was invited to a White House dinner where Frances Perkins was among the guests. Welles told her about the Russian immigrant who did the make-up for his film but could not join the union. Seiderman said the head of the union received a call from the Labor Department the next day, and in November 1941 he was a full union member.\n\nAlthough credited as an assistant, the film's art direction was done by Perry Ferguson. Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration. In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a periscope in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design was an integral part of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.\n\nIn the original script the Great Hall at Xanadu was modeled after the Great Hall in Hearst Castle and its design included a mixture of Renaissance and Gothic styles. \"The Hearstian element is brought out in the almost perverse juxtaposition of incongruous architectural styles and motifs,\" wrote Carringer. Before RKO cut the film's budget, Ferguson's designs were more elaborate and resembled the production designs of early Cecil B. DeMille films and \"Intolerance\". The budget cuts reduced Ferguson's budget by 33 percent and his work cost $58,775 total, which was below average at that time. To save costs Ferguson and Welles re-wrote scenes in Xanadu's living room and transported them to the Great Hall. A large staircase from another film was found and used at no additional cost. When asked about the limited budget, Ferguson said \"Very often—as in that much-discussed 'Xanadu' set in \"Citizen Kane\"—we can make a foreground piece, a background piece, and imaginative lighting suggest a great deal more on the screen than actually exists on the stage.\" According to the film's official budget there were 81 sets built, but Ferguson said there were between 106 and 116.\n\nStill photographs of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, were used in the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots. Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.\n\nThe film's special effects were supervised by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, the scene in which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.\n\nSome shots included rear screen projection in the background, such as Thompson's interview of Leland and some of the ocean backgrounds at Xanadu. Bordwell claims that the scene where Thatcher agrees to be Kane's guardian used rear screen projection to depict young Kane in the background, despite this scene being cited as a prime example of Toland's deep focus cinematography. A special effects camera crew from Walker's department was required for the extreme close-up shots such as Kane's lips when he says \"Rosebud\" and the shot of the typewriter typing Susan's bad review.\n\nOptical effects artist Dunn claimed that \"up to 80 percent of some reels was optically printed.\" These shots were traditionally attributed to Toland for years. The optical printer improved some of the deep focus shots. One problem with the optical printer was that it sometimes created excessive graininess, such as the optical zoom out of the snow globe. Welles decided to superimpose snow falling to mask the graininess in these shots. Toland said that he disliked the results of the optical printer, but acknowledged that \"RKO special effects expert Vernon Walker, ASC, and his staff handled their part of the production—a by no means inconsiderable assignment—with ability and fine understanding.\"\n\nAny time deep focus was impossible—as in the scene in which Kane finishes a negative review of Susan's opera while at the same time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.\n\nThe film's music was composed by Bernard Herrmann. Herrmann had composed for Welles for his Mercury Theatre radio broadcasts. Because it was Herrmann's first motion picture score, RKO wanted to pay him only a small fee, but Welles insisted he be paid at the same rate as Max Steiner.\n\nThe score established Herrmann as an important new composer of film soundtracks and eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '\"radio scoring\", musical cues typically 5–15 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response. The breakfast montage sequence begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on that theme as the passage of time leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.\n\nHerrmann realized that musicians slated to play his music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no need to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring leitmotiv played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of alto flutes.\n\nFor Susan Alexander Kane's operatic sequence, Welles suggested that Herrmann compose a witty parody of a Mary Garden vehicle, an aria from \"Salammbô\". \"Our problem was to create something that would give the audience the feeling of the quicksand into which this simple little girl, having a charming but small voice, is suddenly thrown,\" Herrmann said. Writing in the style of a 19th-century French Oriental opera, Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander. Soprano Jean Forward dubbed the vocal part for Comingore. Houseman claimed to have written the libretto, based on Jean Racine's \"Athalie\" and \"Phedre\", although some confusion remains since Lucille Fletcher remembered preparing the lyrics. Fletcher, then Herrmann's wife, wrote the libretto for his opera \"Wuthering Heights\".\n\nMusic enthusiasts consider the scene in which Susan Alexander Kane attempts to sing the famous cavatina \"Una voce poco fa\" from \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" by Gioachino Rossini with vocal coach Signor Matiste as especially memorable for depicting the horrors of learning music through mistakes.\n\nIn 1972, Herrmann said, \"I was fortunate to start my career with a film like \"Citizen Kane\", it's been a downhill run ever since!\" Welles loved Herrmann's score and told director Henry Jaglom that it was 50 percent responsible for the film's artistic success.\n\nSome incidental music came from other sources. Welles heard the tune used for the publisher's theme, \"Oh, Mr. Kane\", in Mexico. Called \"A Poco No\", the song was written by Pepe Guízar and special lyrics were written by Herman Ruby.\n\n\"In a Mizz\", a 1939 jazz song by Charlie Barnet and Haven Johnson, bookends Thompson's second interview of Susan Alexander Kane. \"I kind of based the whole scene around that song,\" Welles said. \"The music is by Nat Cole—it's his trio.\" Later—beginning with the lyrics, \"It can't be love\"—\"In a Mizz\" is performed at the Everglades picnic, framing the fight in the tent between Susan and Kane. Musicians including bandleader Cee Pee Johnson (drums), Alton Redd (vocals), Raymond Tate (trumpet), Buddy Collette (alto sax) and Buddy Banks (tenor sax) are featured.\n\nAll of the music used in the newsreel came from the RKO music library, edited at Welles's request by the newsreel department to achieve what Herrmann called \"their own crazy way of cutting\". The \"News on the March\" theme that accompanies the newsreel titles is \"Belgian March\" by Anthony Collins, from the film \"Nurse Edith Cavell\". Other examples are an excerpt from Alfred Newman's score for \"Gunga Din\" (the exploration of Xanadu), Roy Webb's theme for the film \"Reno\" (the growth of Kane's empire), and bits of Webb's score for \"Five Came Back\" (introducing Walter Parks Thatcher).\n\nOne of the editing techniques used in \"Citizen Kane\" was the use of montage to collapse time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time. Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene \"was stolen from \"The Long Christmas Dinner\" by Thornton Wilder ... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas dinner that takes you through something like 60 years of a family's life.\" The film often uses long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene in which the abandoned sled is covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.\n\nWelles was influenced by the editing theories of Sergei Eisenstein by using jarring cuts that caused \"sudden graphic or associative contrasts\", such as the cut from Kane's deathbed to the beginning of the \"News on the March\" sequence and a sudden shot of a shrieking bird at the beginning of Raymond's flashback. Although the film typically favors mise-en-scène over montage, the scene in which Kane goes to Susan Alexander's apartment after first meeting her is the only one that is primarily cut as close-ups with shots and counter shots between Kane and Susan. Fabe says that \"by using a standard Hollywood technique sparingly, [Welles] revitalizes its psychological expressiveness.\"\n\nIn her 1992 monograph for the British Film Institute, critic Laura Mulvey explored the anti-fascist themes of \"Citizen Kane\". The \"News on the March\" newsreel presents Kane keeping company with Hitler and other dictators while he smugly assures the public there will be no war. Mulvey wrote that the film reflects \"the battle between intervention and isolationism\" then being waged in the United States; the film was released six months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, while President Franklin D. Roosevelt was laboring to win public opinion for entering World War II. \"Not only was the war in Europe the burning public issue of the time,\" Mulvey wrote, \"it was of passionate personal importance to Orson Welles ... In the rhetoric of \"Citizen Kane\", the destiny of isolationism is realised in metaphor: in Kane's own fate, dying wealthy and lonely, surrounded by the detritus of European culture and history.\"\n\nJournalist Ignacio Ramonet has cited the film as an early example of mass media manipulation of public opinion and the power that media conglomerates have on influencing the democratic process. Ramonet believes that this early example of a media mogul influencing politics is outdated and that \"today Citizen Kane would be a dwarf. He owned a few papers in one country. The forces that dominate today have integrated image with text and sound and the world is their market. There are media groups with the power of a thousand Citizen Kanes.\" Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is sometimes labeled as a latter-day \"Citizen Kane\".\nTo ensure that Hearst's life's influence on \"Citizen Kane\" was a secret, Welles limited access to dailies and managed the film's publicity. A December 1940 feature story in \"Stage\" magazine compared the film's narrative to \"Faust\" and made no mention of Hearst.\n\nThe film was scheduled to premiere at RKO's flagship theater Radio City Music Hall on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score. Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941 for such magazines as \"Life\", \"Look\" and \"Redbook\". Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (and Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers Louella Parsons' arch rival) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a \"vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man\" and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography. \"Friday\" magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons. Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn't understand why she was so nice to him and that she should \"wait until the woman finds out that the picture's about her boss.\" Welles immediately denied making the statement and the editor of \"Friday\" admitted that it might be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made that remark.\nShortly after \"Friday\"s article, Hearst sent Parsons an angry letter complaining that he had learned about \"Citizen Kane\" from Hopper and not her. The incident made a fool of Parsons and compelled her to start attacking Welles and the film. Parsons demanded a private screening of the film and personally threatened Schaefer on Hearst's behalf, first with a lawsuit and then with a vague threat of consequences for everyone in Hollywood. On January 10 Parsons and two lawyers working for Hearst were given a private screening of the film. James G. Stewart was present at the screening and said that she walked out of the film. Soon after, Parsons called Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released \"Kane\". She also contacted the management of Radio City Music Hall and demanded that they not screen it. The next day, the front page headline in \"Daily Variety\" read, \"HEARST BANS RKO FROM PAPERS.\" Hearst began this ban by suppressing promotion of RKO's \"Kitty Foyle\", but in two weeks the ban was lifted for everything except \"Kane.\"\n\nWhen Schaefer did not submit to Parsons she called other studio heads and made more threats on behalf of Hearst to expose the private lives of people throughout the entire film industry. Welles was threatened with an exposé about his romance with the married actress Dolores del Rio, who wanted the affair kept secret until her divorce was finalized. In a statement to journalists Welles denied that the film was about Hearst. Hearst began preparing an injunction against the film for libel and invasion of privacy, but Welles's lawyer told him that he doubted Hearst would proceed due to the negative publicity and required testimony that an injunction would bring.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" ran a front-page story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's practice of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs that could be done by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve \"Kane\". Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe haven of the United States. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Schenck, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of Louis B. Mayer and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative. Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that \"Kane\" would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made. Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.\n\nHearing about \"Citizen Kane\" enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing, or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists libel Welles. Welles used Hearst's opposition as a pretext for previewing the film in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging. A special press screening took place in early March. Henry Luce was in attendance and reportedly wanted to buy the film from RKO for $1 million to distribute it himself. The reviews for this screening were positive. A \"Hollywood Review\" headline read, \"Mr. Genius Comes Through; 'Kane' Astonishing Picture\". The \"Motion Picture Herald\" reported about the screening and Hearst's intention to sue RKO. \"Time\" magazine wrote that \"The objection of Mr. Hearst, who founded a publishing empire on sensationalism, is ironic. For to most of the several hundred people who have seen the film at private screenings, \"Citizen Kane\" is the most sensational product of the U.S. movie industry.\" A second press screening occurred in April.\n\nWhen Schaefer rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary \"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\" lays the blame for the film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason \"Kane\" failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.\n\nHearst's attacks against Welles went beyond attempting to suppress the film. Welles said that while he was on his post-filming lecture tour a police detective approached him at a restaurant and advised him not to go back to his hotel. A 14-year-old girl had reportedly been hidden in the closet of his room, and two photographers were waiting for him to walk in. Knowing he would be jailed after the resulting publicity, Welles did not return to the hotel but waited until the train left town the following morning. \"But that wasn't Hearst,\" Welles said, \"that was a hatchet man from the local Hearst paper who thought he would advance himself by doing it.\"\n\nIn March 1941 Welles directed a Broadway version of Richard Wright's \"Native Son\" (and, for luck, used a \"Rosebud\" sled as a prop). \"Native Son\" received positive reviews, but Hearst-owned papers used the opportunity to attack Welles as a communist. The Hearst papers vociferously attacked Welles after his April 1941 radio play, \"His Honor, the Mayor\", produced for The Free Company radio series on CBS.\n\nWelles described his chance encounter with Hearst in an elevator at the Fairmont Hotel on the night \"Citizen Kane\" opened in San Francisco. Hearst and Welles's father were acquaintances, so Welles introduced himself and asked Hearst if he would like to come to the opening. Hearst did not respond. \"As he was getting off at his floor, I said, 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply\", recalled Welles. \"And Kane would have you know. That was his style—just as he finished Jed Leland's bad review of Susan as an opera singer.\"\n\nIn 1945 Hearst journalist Robert Shaw wrote that the film got \"a full tide of insensate fury\" from Hearst papers, \"then it ebbed suddenly. With one brain cell working, the chief realized that such hysterical barking by the trained seals would attract too much attention to the picture. But to this day the name of Orson Welles is on the official son-of-a-bitch list of every Hearst newspaper.\"\n\nDespite Hearst's attempts to destroy the film, since 1941 references to his life and career have usually included a reference to \"Citizen Kane\", such as the headline 'Son of Citizen Kane Dies' for the obituary of Hearst's son. In 2012 the Hearst estate agreed to screen the film at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, breaking Hearst's ban on the film.\n\nRadio City Music Hall's management refused to screen \"Citizen Kane\" for its premiere. A possible factor was Parsons's threat that \"The American Weekly\" would run a defamatory story on the grandfather of major RKO stockholder Nelson Rockefeller. Other exhibitors feared being sued for libel by Hearst and refused to show the film. In March Welles threatened the RKO board of governors with a lawsuit if they did not release the film. Schaefer stood by Welles and opposed the board of governors. When RKO still delayed the film's release Welles offered to buy the film for $1 million and the studio finally agreed to release the film on May 1.\n\nSchaefer managed to book a few theaters willing to show the film. Hearst papers refused to accept advertising. RKO's publicity advertisements for the film erroneously promoted it as a love story.\n\n\"Kane\" opened at the RKO Palace Theatre on Broadway in New York on May 1, 1941, in Chicago on May 6, and in Los Angeles on May 8. Welles said that at the Chicago premiere that he attended the theater was almost empty. It did well in cities and larger towns but fared poorly in more remote areas. RKO still had problems getting exhibitors to show the film. For example, one chain controlling more than 500 theaters got Welles's film as part of a package but refused to play it, reportedly out of fear of Hearst. Hearst's disruption of the film's release damaged its box office performance and, as a result, it lost $160,000 during its initial run. The film earned $23,878 during its first week in New York. By the ninth week it only made $7,279. Overall it lost money in New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., but made a profit in Seattle.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" received good reviews from several critics. \"New York Daily News\" critic Kate Cameron called it \"one of the most interesting and technically superior films that has ever come out of a Hollywood studio\". \"New York World-Telegram\" critic William Boehnel said that the film was \"staggering and belongs at once among the greatest screen achievements\". \"Time\" magazine wrote that \"it has found important new techniques in picture-making and story-telling.\" \"Life\" magazine's review said that \"few movies have ever come from Hollywood with such powerful narrative, such original technique, such exciting photography.\" John C. Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" called the film's style \"like fresh air\" and raved \"Something new has come to the movie world at last.\" Anthony Bower of \"The Nation\" called it \"brilliant\" and praised the cinematography and performances by Welles, Comingore and Cotten. John O'Hara's \"Newsweek\" review called it the best picture he'd ever seen and said Welles was \"the best actor in the history of acting.\" Welles called O'Hara's review \"the greatest review that anybody ever had.\"\n\nThe day following the premiere of \"Citizen Kane,\" \"The New York Times\" critic Bosley Crowther wrote that \"... it comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood.\"\n\nCount on Mr. Welles: he doesn't do things by halves. ... Upon the screen he discovered an area large enough for his expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence is that he has made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.\n\nIn the UK C. A. Lejeune of \"The Observer\" called it \"The most exciting film that has come out of Hollywood in twenty-five years\" and Dilys Powell of \"The Sunday Times\" said the film's style was made \"with the ease and boldness and resource of one who controls and is not controlled by his medium.\" Edward Tangye Lean of \"Horizon\" praised the film's technical style, calling it \"perhaps a decade ahead of its contemporaries.\"\n\nA few reviews were mixed. Otis Ferguson of \"The New Republic\" said it was \"the boldest free-hand stroke in major screen production since Griffith and Bitzer were running wild to unshackle the camera\", but also criticized its style, calling it a \"retrogression in film technique\" and stating that \"it holds no great place\" in film history. Ferguson reacted to some of the film's celebrated visual techniques by calling them \"just willful dabbling\" and \"the old shell game.\" In a rare film review, filmmaker Erich von Stroheim criticized the film's story and non-linear structure, but praised the technical style and performances, and wrote \"Whatever the truth may be about it, \"Citizen Kane\" is a great picture and will go down in screen history. More power to Welles!\"\n\nSome prominent critics wrote negative reviews. In his 1941 review for \"Sur\", Jorge Luis Borges famously called the film \"a labyrinth with no center\" and predicted that its legacy would be a film \"whose historical value is undeniable but which no one cares to see again.\" \"The Argus Weekend Magazine\" critic Erle Cox called the film \"amazing\" but thought that Welles's break with Hollywood traditions was \"overdone.\" \"Tatler\"s James Agate called it \"the well-intentioned, muddled, amateurish thing one expects from high-brows\" and \"a quite good film which tries to run the psychological essay in harness with your detective thriller, and doesn't quite succeed.\" Eileen Creelman of \"The New York Sun\" called it \"a cold picture, unemotional, a puzzle rather than a drama\". Other people who disliked the film were W. H. Auden and James Agee. After watching the film on the 29th January 1942 Kenneth Williams, then aged 15, writing in his first diary curtly described it as \"boshey rot\". Bosh meaning empty or meaningless, nonsense or foolish.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Picture. The National Board of Review voted it Best Film of 1941, and recognized Welles and Coulouris for their performances.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" received nine nominations at the 1941 Academy Awards:\n\nIt was widely believed the film would win most of its Oscar nominations, but it received only the award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), shared by Welles and Mankiewicz. \"Variety\" reported that block voting by screen extras deprived \"Citizen Kane\" of Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were likely to have been responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" was the only film made under Welles's original contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control. Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse. In July 1941, Welles reluctantly signed a new and less favorable deal with RKO under which he produced and directed \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942), produced \"Journey into Fear\" (1943), and began \"It's All True\", a film he agreed to do without payment. In the new contract Welles was an employee of the studio and lost the right to final cut, which later allowed RKO to modify and re-cut \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" over his objections. In June 1942 Schaefer resigned the presidency of RKO Pictures and Welles's contract was terminated by his successor.\n\nDuring World War II, \"Citizen Kane\" was not seen in most European countries. It was shown in France for the first time on July 10, 1946 at the Marbeuf theatre in Paris. Initially most French film critics were influenced by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946. At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that \"the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about. The film is in the past tense, whereas we all know that cinema has got to be in the present tense.\"\n\nAndré Bazin, a little-known film critic working for Sartre's \"Les Temps modernes\", was asked to give an impromptu speech about the film after a screening at the Colisée Theatre in the autumn of 1946 and changed the opinion of much of the audience. This speech led to Bazin's 1947 article \"The Technique of Citizen Kane\", which directly influenced public opinion about the film. Carringer wrote that Bazin was \"the one who did the most to enhance the film's reputation.\" Both Bazin's critique of the film and his theories about cinema itself centered around his strong belief in mise en scène. These theories were diametrically opposed to both the popular Soviet montage theory and the politically Marxist and anti-Hollywood beliefs of most French film critics at that time. Bazin believed that a film should depict reality without the filmmaker imposing their \"will\" on the spectator, which the Soviet theory supported. Bazin wrote that \"Citizen Kane\"s mise en scène created a \"new conception of filmmaking\" and that the freedom given to the audience from the deep focus shots was innovative by changing the entire concept of the cinematic image. Bazin wrote extensively about the mise en scène in the scene where Susan Alexander attempts suicide, which was one long take while other films would have used four or five shots in the scene. Bazin wrote that the film's mise en scène \"forces the spectator to participate in the meaning of the film\" and creates \"a psychological realism which brings the spectator back to the real conditions of perception.\"\n\nIn his 1950 essay \"The Evolution of the Language of Cinema\", Bazin placed \"Citizen Kane\" center stage as a work which ushered in a new period in cinema. One of the first critics to defend motion pictures as being on the same artistic level as literature or painting, Bazin often used the film as an example of cinema as an art form and wrote that \"Welles has given the cinema a theoretical restoration. He has enriched his filmic repertory with new or forgotten effects that, in today's artistic context, take on a significance we didn't know they could have.\" Bazin also compared the film to Roberto Rossellini's \"Paisà\" for having \"the same aesthetic concept of realism\" and to the films of William Wyler shot by Toland (such as \"The Little Foxes\" and \"The Best Years of Our Lives\"), all of which used deep focus cinematography that Bazin called \"a dialectical step forward in film language.\"\n\nBazin's praise of the film went beyond film theory and reflected his own philosophy towards life itself. His metaphysical interpretations about the film reflected humankind's place in the universe. Bazin believed that the film examined one person's identity and search for meaning. It portrayed the world as ambiguous and full of contradictions, whereas films up until then simply portrayed people's actions and motivations. Bazin's biographer Dudley Andrew wrote that:\n\nThe world of \"Citizen Kane\", that mysterious, dark, and infinitely deep world of space and memory where voices trail off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.\n\nBazin went on to co-found \"Cahiers du cinéma\", whose contributors (including future film directors François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard) also praised the film. The popularity of Truffaut's auteur theory helped the film's and Welles's reputation.\n\nBy 1942 \"Citizen Kane\" had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished and both the film's and Welles's reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic Richard Griffith in his overview of cinema, \"The Film Till Now\", dismissed \"Citizen Kane\" as \"... tinpot if not crackpot Freud.\"\n\nIn the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States: first, RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television, and early that year \"Citizen Kane\" started to appear on television; second, the film was re-released theatrically to coincide with Welles's return to the New York stage, where he played \"King Lear\"; and third, American film critic Andrew Sarris wrote \"Citizen Kane: The American Baroque\" for \"Film Culture\", and described it as \"the great American film\" and \"the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since \"Birth of a Nation\".\" Carringer considers Sarris's essay as the most important influence on the film's reputation in the US.\n\nDuring Expo 58, a poll of over 100 film historians named \"Kane\" one of the top ten greatest films ever made (the group gave first-place honors to \"The Battleship Potemkin\"). When a group of young film directors announced their vote for the top six, they were booed for not including the film.\n\nIn the decades since, its critical status as the greatest film ever made has grown, with numerous essays and books on it including Peter Cowie's \"The Cinema of Orson Welles\", Ronald Gottesman's \"Focus on Citizen Kane\", a collection of significant reviews and background pieces, and most notably Kael's essay, \"Raising Kane\", which promoted the value of the film to a much wider audience than it had reached before. Despite its criticism of Welles, it further popularized the notion of \"Citizen Kane\" as the great American film. The rise of art house and film society circuits also aided in the film's rediscovery. David Thomson said that the film 'grows with every year as America comes to resemble it.\"\n\nThe British magazine \"Sight & Sound\" has produced a Top Ten list surveying film critics every decade since 1952, and is regarded as one of the most respected barometers of critical taste. \"Citizen Kane\" was a runner up to the top 10 in its 1952 poll but was voted as the greatest film ever made in its 1962 poll, retaining the top spot in every subsequent poll until 2012, when \"Vertigo\" displaced it.\n\nThe film has also ranked number one in the following film \"best of\" lists: Julio Castedo's \"The 100 Best Films of the Century\", Cahiers du cinéma's 100 films pour une cinémathèque idéale, \"Kinovedcheskie Zapiski\", \"Time Out\" magazine's Top 100 Films (Centenary), \"The Village Voice\"s 100 Greatest Films, and The Royal Belgian Film Archive's Most Important and Misappreciated American Films.\n\nRoger Ebert called \"Citizen Kane\" the greatest film ever made: \"But people don't always ask about the greatest film. They ask, 'What's your favorite movie?' Again, I always answer with \"Citizen Kane\".\"\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" was an inductee of the 1989 inaugural group of 25 films that established the National Film Registry list.\n\nOn February 18, 1999, the United States Postal Service honored \"Citizen Kane\" by including it in its Celebrate the Century series. The film was honored again February 25, 2003, in a series of U.S. postage stamps marking the 75th anniversary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Art director Perry Ferguson represents the behind-the-scenes craftsmen of filmmaking in the series; he is depicted completing a sketch for \"Citizen Kane\".\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" was ranked number one in the American Film Institute's polls of film industry artists and leaders in 1998 and 2007. \"Rosebud\" was chosen as the 17th most memorable movie quotation in a 2005 AFI poll. The film's score was one of 250 nominees for the top 25 film scores in American cinema in another 2005 AFI poll.\n\nIn 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild published a list of the 75 best-edited films of all time based on a survey of its membership. \"Citizen Kane\" was listed second.\n\nThe film currently has a 100% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 77 reviews by approved critics, with an average rating of 9.4/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Orson Welles's epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall is entertaining, poignant, and inventive in its storytelling, earning its reputation as a landmark achievement in film.\"\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" has been called the most influential film of all time. Richard Corliss has asserted that Jules Dassin's 1941 film \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was the first example of its influence and the first pop culture reference to the film occurred later in 1941 when the spoof comedy \"Hellzapoppin'\" featured a \"Rosebud\" sled. The film's cinematography was almost immediately influential and in 1942 \"American Cinematographer\" wrote \"without a doubt the most immediately noticeable trend in cinematography methods during the year was the trend toward crisper definition and increased depth of field.\"\n\nThe cinematography influenced John Huston's \"The Maltese Falcon\". Cinematographer Arthur Edeson used a wider-angle lens than Toland and the film includes many long takes, low angles and shots of the ceiling, but it did not use deep focus shots on large sets to the extent that \"Citizen Kane\" did. Edeson and Toland are often credited together for revolutionizing cinematography in 1941. Toland's cinematography influenced his own work on \"The Best Years of Our Lives\". Other films influenced include \"Gaslight\", \"Mildred Pierce\" and \"Jane Eyre\". Cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa said that his use of deep focus was influenced by \"the camera work of Gregg Toland in \"Citizen Kane\"\" and not by traditional Japanese art.\n\nIts cinematography, lighting, and flashback structure influenced such film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s as \"The Killers\", \"Keeper of the Flame\", \"Caught\", \"The Great Man\" and \"This Gun for Hire\". David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson have written that \"For over a decade thereafter American films displayed exaggerated foregrounds and somber lighting, enhanced by long takes and exaggerated camera movements.\" However, by the 1960s filmmakers such as those from the French New Wave and Cinéma vérité movements favored \"flatter, more shallow images with softer focus\" and \"Citizen Kane\"s style became less fashionable. American filmmakers in the 1970s combined these two approaches by using long takes, rapid cutting, deep focus and telephoto shots all at once. Its use of long takes influenced films such as \"The Asphalt Jungle\", and its use of deep focus cinematography influenced \"Gun Crazy\", \"The Whip Hand\", \"The Devil's General\" and \"Justice Is Done\". The flashback structure in which different characters have conflicting versions of past events influenced \"La commare secca\" and \"Man of Marble\".\n\nThe film's structure influenced the biographical films \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and \"\"—which begin with the subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller \"Mr. Arkadin\". Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to \"Mr. Arkadin\", as well as the theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with \"Citizen Kane\" and including \"The Magnificent Ambersons\", \"Mr. Arkadin\" and \"Chimes at Midnight\". Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced Warren Beatty's \"Reds\". The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in \"Citizen Kane\".\n\nAkira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" is often compared to the film due to both having complicated plot structures told by multiple characters in the film. Welles said his initial idea for the film was \"Basically, the idea \"Rashomon\" used later on,\" however Kurosawa had not yet seen the film before making \"Rashomon\" in 1950. Nigel Andrews has compared the film's complex plot structure to \"Rashomon\", \"Last Year at Marienbad\", \"Memento\" and \"Magnolia\". Andrews also compares Charles Foster Kane to Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather\", Jake LaMotta in \"Raging Bull\" and Daniel Plainview in \"There Will Be Blood\" for their portrayals of \"haunted megalomaniac[s], presiding over the shards of [their] own [lives].\"\n\nThe films of Paul Thomas Anderson have been compared to it. \"Variety\" compared \"There Will Be Blood\" to the film and called it \"one that rivals \"Giant\" and \"Citizen Kane\" in our popular lore as origin stories about how we came to be the people we are.\" \"The Master\" has been called \"movieland's only spiritual sequel to \"Citizen Kane\" that doesn't shrivel under the hefty comparison\" and the film's loose depiction of L. Ron Hubbard has been compared to \"Citizen Kane\"s depiction of Hearst. \"The Social Network\" has been compared to the film for its depiction of a media mogul and by the character Erica Albright being similar to \"Rosebud\". The controversy of the Sony hacking before the release of \"The Interview\" brought comparisons of Hearst's attempt to suppress the film. The film's plot structure and some specific shots influenced Todd Haynes's \"Velvet Goldmine\". Abbas Kiarostami's \"The Traveler\" has been called \"the \"Citizen Kane\" of the Iranian children's cinema.\" The film's use of overlapping dialogue has influenced the films of Robert Altman and Carol Reed. Reed's films \"Odd Man Out\", \"The Third Man\" (in which Welles and Cotten appeared) and \"Outcast of the Islands\" were also influenced by the film's cinematography.\n\nMany directors have listed it as one of the greatest films ever made, including Woody Allen, Michael Apted, Les Blank, Kenneth Branagh, Paul Greengrass, Michel Hazanavicius, Michael Mann, Sam Mendes, Jiri Menzel, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Denys Arcand, Gillian Armstrong, John Boorman, Roger Corman, Alex Cox, Milos Forman, Norman Jewison, Richard Lester, Richard Linklater, Paul Mazursky, Ronald Neame, Sydney Pollack and Stanley Kubrick. Yasujirō Ozu said it was his favorite non-Japanese film and was impressed by its techniques. François Truffaut said that the film \"has inspired more vocations to cinema throughout the world than any other\" and recognized its influence in \"The Barefoot Contessa\", \"Les Mauvaises Rencontres\", \"Lola Montès\", and \"8 1/2\". Truffaut's \"Day for Night\" pays tribute to the film in a dream sequence depicting a childhood memory of the character played by Truffaut stealing publicity photos from the film. Numerous film directors have cited the film as influential on their own films, including Theo Angelopoulos, Luc Besson, the Coen brothers, Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, John Frankenheimer, Stephen Frears, Sergio Leone, Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, Martin Scorsese, Bryan Singer and Steven Spielberg. Ingmar Bergman disliked the film and called it \"a total bore. Above all, the performances are worthless. The amount of respect that movie has is absolutely unbelievable!\"\n\nWilliam Friedkin said that the film influenced him and called it \"a veritable quarry for filmmakers, just as Joyce's \"Ulysses\" is a quarry for writers.\" The film has also influenced other art forms. Carlos Fuentes's novel \"The Death of Artemio Cruz\" was partially inspired by the film and the rock band The White Stripes paid unauthorized tribute to the film in the song \"The Union Forever\".\n\nIn 1982, film director Steven Spielberg bought a \"Rosebud\" sled for $60,500; it was one of three balsa sleds used in the closing scenes and the only one that was not burned. After the Spielberg purchase, it was reported that retiree Arthur Bauer claimed to own another \"Rosebud\" sled. In early 1942 when Bauer was 12 he won an RKO publicity contest and selected the hardwood sled as his prize. In 1996, Bauer's estate offered the painted pine sled at auction through Christie's. Bauer's son told CBS News that his mother had once wanted to paint the sled and use it as a plant stand, but Bauer told her to \"just save it and put it in the closet.\" The sled was sold to an anonymous bidder for $233,500.\n\nWelles's Oscar for Best Original Screenplay was believed to be lost until it was rediscovered in 1994. It was withdrawn from a 2007 auction at Sotheby's when bidding failed to reach its estimate of $800,000 to $1.2 million. Owned by the charitable Dax Foundation, it was auctioned for $861,542 in 2011 to an anonymous buyer. Mankiewicz's Oscar was sold at least twice, in 1999 and again in 2012, the latest price being $588,455.\n\nIn 1989, Mankiewicz's personal copy of the \"Citizen Kane\" script was auctioned at Christie's. The leather-bound volume included the final shooting script and a carbon copy of \"American\" that bore handwritten annotations—purportedly made by Hearst's lawyers, who were said to have obtained it in the manner described by Kael in \"Raising Kane\". Estimated to bring $70,000 to $90,000, it sold for a record $231,000.\n\nIn 2007, Welles's personal copy of the last revised draft of \"Citizen Kane\" before the shooting script was sold at Sotheby's for $97,000. A second draft of the script titled \"American\", marked \"Mr. Welles' working copy\", was auctioned by Sotheby's in 2014 for $164,692. A collection of 24 pages from a working script found in Welles's personal possessions by his daughter Beatrice Welles was auctioned in 2014 for $15,000.\n\nIn 2014, a collection of approximately 235 \"Citizen Kane\" stills and production photos that had belonged to Welles was sold at auction for $7,812.\n\nThe composited camera negative of \"Citizen Kane\" was destroyed in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent prints were derived from a master positive (a fine-grain preservation element) made in the 1940s and originally intended for use in overseas distribution. Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which Paramount released for then-owner Turner Broadcasting System, which earned $1.6 million in North America.\n\nIn 1955, RKO sold the American television rights to its film library, including \"Citizen Kane\", to C&C Television Corp. In 1960, television rights to the pre-1956 RKO library were acquired by United Artists. RKO kept the non-broadcast television rights to its library.\n\nIn 1976, when home video was in its infancy, entrepreneur Snuff Garrett bought cassette rights to the RKO library for what United Press International termed \"a pittance.\" In 1978 The Nostalgia Merchant released the film through Media Home Entertainment. By 1980 the 800-title library of The Nostalgia Merchant was earning $2.3 million a year. \"Nobody wanted cassettes four years ago,\" Garrett told UPI. \"It wasn't the first time people called me crazy. It was a hobby with me which became big business.\" RKO Home Video released the film on VHS and Betamax in 1985.\n\nIn 1984, The Criterion Collection released the film as its first LaserDisc. It was made from a fine grain master positive provided by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. When told about the then-new concept of having an audio commentary on the disc, Welles was skeptical but said \"theoretically, that's good for teaching movies, so long as they don't talk nonsense.\" In 1992 Criterion released a new 50th Anniversary Edition LaserDisc. This version had an improved transfer and additional special features, including the documentary \"The Legacy of Citizen Kane\" and Welles's early short \"The Hearts of Age\".\n\nTurner Broadcasting System acquired broadcast television rights to the RKO library in 1986 and the full worldwide rights to the library in 1987. The RKO Home Video unit was reorganized into Turner Home Entertainment that year. In 1991 Turner released a 50th Anniversary Edition on VHS and as a collector's edition that includes the film, the documentary \"Reflections On Citizen Kane\", Harlan Lebo's 50th anniversary album, a poster and a copy of the original script. In 1996, Time Warner acquired Turner and Warner Home Video absorbed Turner Home Entertainment. Today, Time Warner's Warner Bros. unit has distribution rights for the film.\n\nIn 2001, Warner Home Video released a 60th Anniversary Collectors Edition DVD. The two-disc DVD included feature-length commentaries by Roger Ebert and Peter Bogdanovich, as well as a second DVD with the feature length documentary \"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\" (1999). It was simultaneously released on VHS. The DVD was criticized for being \"\"too\" bright, \"too clean\"; the dirt and grime had been cleared away, but so had a good deal of the texture, the depth, and the sense of film grain.\"\n\nIn 2003, Welles's daughter Beatrice Welles sued Turner Entertainment, claiming the Welles estate is the legal copyright holder of the film. She claimed that Welles's deal to terminate his contracts with RKO meant that Turner's copyright of the film was null and void. She also claimed that the estate of Orson Welles was owed 20% of the film's profits if her copyright claim was not upheld. In 2007 she was allowed to proceed with the lawsuit, overturning the 2004 decision in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video rights.\n\nIn 2011, it was released on Blu-ray and DVD in a 70th Anniversary Edition. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called it \"the Blu-ray release of the year.\" Supplements included everything available on the 2001 Warner Home Video release, including \"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\" DVD. A 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition added a third DVD with \"RKO 281\" (1999), an award winning TV movie about the making of the film. Its packaging extras included a hardcover book and a folio containing mini reproductions of the original souvenir program, lobby cards, and production memos and correspondence. The transfer for the US releases were scanned as 4K resolution from three different 35mm prints and rectified the quality issues of the 2001 DVD. The rest of the world continued to receive home video releasees based on the older transfer. This was partially rectified in 2016 with the release of the 75th Anniversary Edition in both the UK and US, which was a straight repackaging of the main disc from the 70th Anniversary Edition.\n\nIn the 1980s, \"Citizen Kane\" became a catalyst in the controversy over the colorization of black-and-white films. One proponent of film colorization was Ted Turner, whose Turner Entertainment Company owned the RKO library. A Turner Entertainment spokesperson initially stated that \"Citizen Kane\" would not be colorized, but in July 1988 Turner said, \"\"Citizen Kane?\" I'm thinking of colorizing it.\" In early 1989 it was reported that two companies were producing color tests for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased when filmmaker Henry Jaglom stated that shortly before his death Welles had implored him \"don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons.\"\n\nIn February 1989, Turner Entertainment President Roger Mayer announced that work to colorize the film had been stopped due to provisions in Welles's 1939 contract with RKO that \"could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate.\" Mayer added that Welles's contract was \"quite unusual\" and \"other contracts we have checked out are not like this at all.\" Turner had only colorized the final reel of the film before abandoning the project. In 1991 one minute of the colorized test footage was included in the BBC \"Arena\" documentary \"The Complete Citizen Kane\".\n\nThe colorization controversy was a factor in the passage of the National Film Preservation Act in 1988 which created the National Film Registry the following year. ABC News anchor Peter Jennings reported that \"one major reason for doing this is to require people like the broadcaster Ted Turner, who's been adding color to some movies and re-editing others for television, to put notices on those versions saying that the movies have been altered\".\n\n\nDatabase\n\nOther\n"}

{"id": "10034431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10034431", "title": "Copy testing", "text": "Copy testing\n\nCopy testing is a specialized field of marketing research that determines an advertisement’s effectiveness based on consumer responses, feedback, and behavior. Also known as pre-testing, it might address all media channels including television, print, radio, outdoor signage, internet, and social media.\n\nAutomated Copy Testing is a specialized type of digital marketing specifically related to digital advertising. This involves using software to deploy copy variations of digital advertisements to a live environment and collecting data from real users. These automated copy tests will generally use a Z-test to determine the statistical significance of results. If a specific ad variation out performs the baseline in the copy test, to a desired level of statistical significance, this new copy variation should be used by the marketer.\n\nIn 1982, a consortium of 21 leading advertising agencies — including N. W. Ayer, D’Arcy, Grey, McCann Erickson, Needham Harper & Steers, Ogilvy & Mather, J. Walter Thompson, and Young & Rubicam — released a public document laying out the PACT (Positioning Advertising Copy Testing) Principles that constitute a good copy testing system. PACT states a good copy testing system must meet the following criteria:\n\nThe predominant copy testing measure of the 1950s and 1960s, Burke's Day-After Recall (DAR) was interpreted to measure an ad’s ability to “break through” into the mind of the consumer and register a message from the brand in long-term memory (Honomichl). Once this measure was adopted by Procter and Gamble, it became a research staple (Honomichl).\n\nIn the 70s, 80s, and 90s, validation efforts found no link between recall scores and actual sales (Adams & Blair; Blair; Blair & Kuse; Blair & Rabuck; Jones; Jones & Blair; MASB; Mondello; Stewart). For example, Procter and Gamble reviewed 10 year’s worth of split-cable tests (100 total) and found no significant relationship between recall scores and sales (Young, pp. 3–30). In addition, Wharton University’s Leonard Lodish conducted an even more extensive review of test market results and also failed to find a relationship between recall and sales (Lodish pp. 125–139).\n\nThe 1970s also saw a re-examination of the “breakthrough” measure. As a result, an important distinction was made between the attention-getting power of the creative execution and how well “branded” the ad was. Thus, the separate measures of attention and branding were born (Young, p. 12).\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, after DAR was determined to be a poor predictor of sales, the research industry began to depend on a measure of persuasion as an accurate predictor of sales. This shift was led, in part, by researcher Horace Schwerin who pointed out, “the obvious truth is that a claim can be well remembered but completely unimportant to the prospective buyer of the product – the solution the marketer offers is addressed to the wrong need” (Honomichl). As with DAR, it was Procter and Gamble’s acceptance of the ARS Persuasion measure (also known as brand preference) that made it an industry standard. Recall scores were still provided in copy testing reports with the understanding that persuasion was the measure that mattered (Honomichl).\n\nHarold Ross of Mapes & Ross found that persuasion was a better predictor of sales than recall (Ross), and the predictive validity of ARS Persuasion to sales has been reported in several refereed publications (Adams & Blair; Jones & Blair; MASB; Mondello ).\n\nThe main purpose of diagnostic measures is optimization. Understanding diagnostic measures can help advertisers identify creative opportunities to improve executions (Young, p. 7).\n\nNon-verbal measures were developed in response to the belief that much of a commercial’s effects – e.g. the emotional impact – may be difficult for respondents to put into words or scale on verbal rating statements. In fact, many believe the commercial’s effects may be operating below the level of consciousness (Young, p. 7). According to researcher Chuck Young, “There is something in the lovely sounds of our favorite music that we cannot verbalize – and it moves us in ways we cannot express” (Young, p. 22).\n\nIn the 1970s, researchers sought to measure these non-verbal measures biologically by tracking brain wave activities as respondents watched commercials (Krugman). Others experimented with galvanic skin response, voice pitch analysis, and eye-tracking (Young, p. 22). These efforts were not popularly adopted, in part because of the limitations of the technology as well as the poor cost-effectiveness of what was widely perceived as academic, not actionable research.\n\nIn the early 1980s the shift in analytical perspective from thinking of a commercial as the fundamental unit of measurement to be rated in its entirety, to thinking of it as a structured flow of experience, gave rise to experimentation with moment-by-moment systems. The most popular of these was the dial-a-meter response which required respondents to turn a meter, in degrees, toward one end of a scale or another to reflect their opinion of what was on screen at that moment.\n\nMore recently, research companies have started to use psychological tests, such as the Stroop effect, to measure the emotional impact of copy. These techniques exploit the notion that viewers do not know why they react to a product, image, or ad in a certain way (or that they reacted at all) because such reactions occur outside of awareness, through changes in networks of thoughts, ideas, and images.\n\nCopy testing is utilized in an array of fields ranging from commercial development to presidential elections. In 2007, CNN employed this form of market testing throughout the primary and general election. Professor Rita Kirk and Dan Schill from Southern Methodist University worked with CNN to gauge voters reaction to debates between presidential hopefuls.

{"id": "29343691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29343691", "title": "Domestic liability dollarization", "text": "Domestic liability dollarization\n\nDomestic liability dollarization (DLD) refers to the denomination of banking system deposits and lending in a currency other than that of the country in which they are held. DLD does not refer exclusively to denomination in US dollars, as DLD encompasses accounts denominated in internationally traded \"hard\" currencies such as the British pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen, and the Euro (and some of its predecessors, particularly the Deutschmark).\n\nIn developed countries, DLD is defined as Bank for International Settlements reporting banks' local asset positions in foreign currency as a share of GDP. In emerging-market economies (EMs), a proxy measure of DLD is constructed by summing dollar deposits and bank foreign borrowing as a share of GDP. This proxy is based on the assumption that banks match their assets and liabilities by currency type and transfer exchange rate risk to debtors. In other settings, DLD is defined as the share of foreign currency deposits over total deposits.\n\nA variety of causes have been proposed for DLD, some more widely accepted than others. Causes often cited in the early literature on DLD, especially in Latin America, include high fiscal deficits, loose monetary policy and a history of inflation. In an economic environment characterized by these features, the domestic currency (often generically referred to as the peso) serves neither as a reliable medium of exchange nor a predictable store of value. The modern approach to DLD, however, emphasizes that DLD, as typically measured based on interest rate-bearing deposit dollarization, is largely a portfolio choice phenomenon related less with inflation levels than with the distribution of inflation (more precisely, of real return differentials), and relates the outcome to the volatility of inflation and the real exchange rate (and, in turn, the exchange rate policy). Despite the strong intuitive appeal of this idea, there is comparatively little empirical work on this issue. Among the work that has been done, however, Berkmen and Cavallo (2007) do not find evidence that more active intervention in foreign exchange markets (i.e., more fixing) leads to higher liability dollarization.\n\nOthers have argued that a closely managed exchange rate is an effect rather than a cause of DLD, a claim empirically supported in Berkmen and Cavallo (2007). It has additionally been proposed that DLD reflects a lack of faith in the domestic currency and ultimately in the quality of government, and that countries whose governments rank higher on various indices of quality experience lower levels of DLD than their more poorly performing counterparts.\n\nResearchers have attributed a variety of both positive and negative effects to DLD. The benefits are largely found at the household and firm levels in the short to medium term. These benefits include insurance against inflation and currency devaluation, as well as permitting long-term lending and borrowing through the use of a relatively stable currency.\n\nIn contrast, the real or potential costs of DLD exist largely at the systemic level and over the long term. When DLD is widespread, economic actors are often required to experience a currency mismatch between domestically denominated income and dollar-denominated liabilities, which represent the only available means of long-term borrowing. Currency mismatches are a particular danger for firms and sectors in non-tradable goods and services. Countries with high levels of DLD, moreover, are often afflicted as well with \"Original Sin,\" a country's inability to borrow in its own currency. While the resulting vulnerability may not be apparent in normal times, it can be revealed during turbulent times, even in the absence of a major crisis. In economies with fixed or heavily managed exchange rate regimes, for instance, an abrupt change in regime can reveal the exposure of actors who have not hedged for exchange rate risk. Internal as well as external shocks to the real exchange rate and/or real effective rate can produce similarly disruptive balance sheet effects, with economy-wide implications for liquidity. These problems can become particularly acute in an economy without an effective lender of last resort and/or one that issues only domestically denominated debt. Extensive DLD additionally impedes adjustment by means of the real exchange rate and increases the likelihood and severity of a sudden stop. Thus, \"fear of floating\" (that is not allowing the exchange rate to adjust in the face of external shocks, see: floating exchange rate) may be a consequence of DLD, as countries with unofficially dollarized economies may find a freely moving exchange rate to be too costly. Berkmen and Cavallo tested the causality between DLD and fear of floating empirically; their findings support the \"fear of floating\" argument. Countries with high liability dollarization (external, public, or financial) tend to stabilize their exchange rate. This finding is robust to various proxies for exchange rate management. For the reverse causality, on the other hand, the authors do not find evidence that more active intervention in foreign exchange markets (i.e., more fixing) leads to higher liability dollarization.\n\nOver time, economies with high levels of DLD can display the following problems: i) an unstable demand for money; ii) a high propensity to experience banking crises following a depreciation of the local currency; and iii) slow and volatile output growth without a significant increase in domestic financial system depth.\n\nPolicy interventions to reduce DLD have taken a variety of recommended and actual forms and have met with varying degrees of success. It is generally agreed that controlling inflation is necessary, as the uncertainties brought about by inflation represent perhaps the greatest single determinant of DLD. Yet reducing inflation alone is generally not considered sufficient to achieve de-dollarization, as economies with high levels of DLD may exhibit hysteresis once actors adjust their expectations and behaviors to transactions denominated in foreign currency.\n\nIn addition, low volatility of inflation relative to the volatility of RER depreciation may be needed to lead to de-dollarization. To date, only two countries, Israel in the 1980s and 1990s and Poland in the 1990s, have managed to engage in successful de-dollarization without extensive negative consequences; both countries managed this transition through combining disinflation with a strong exchange rate anchor. Moreover, in addition to a one-year mandatory hold on dollar deposits, Israel undertook a series of \"patches\" including the following: i) CPI-indexed deposits; ii) requirements that banks undertake active hedging of currency risk for non-tradable activities; iii) active development of financial derivatives markets; and iv) efforts to deepen local currency bond markets. Poland's disinflationary efforts, moreover, coincided with a very high real exchange rate. Under less favorable circumstances, or in the absence of policies designed to facilitate adjustment, forced de-dollarization has provoked extensive capital flight and/or steep declines in financial intermediation.\n\nIn recent years there has been a revival of interest in lending in domestic currency, especially in Latin America, and there is evidence that public debt has in fact become less dollarized. This revival may represent an attempt to \"lean against the wind\" in the face of expectations of currency appreciation as well as a response to the collapse of Argentina's Convertibility regime, which illustrated the macroeconomic risks of extensive DLD.\n\nA second potential channel of de-dollarization is the increasing use of domestic currency lending to the private sector as well as to sovereigns and subnational governments by international financial institutions, particularly the Inter-American Development Bank. In addition to hedging those institutions' currency risk, multilateral lending in domestic currency offers a potential solution to a first mover problem and a signal to other economic actors.\n\n\n"}

Downtown is the mass transit hub of Berkeley, with several AC Transit and UC Berkeley bus lines converging on the city's busiest BART station, as well as the location of Berkeley's civic center, high school, and Berkeley City College.\n\nThe area was formerly a settlement site of the Huichin/Chochen band of the Ohlone indigenous people. Artifacts were found in the 1950s during the digging of a basement on Kittredge Street. The site was probably associated with the proximity of Strawberry Creek which ran along what is today's Allston Way. During the days when the land was part of the vast Rancho San Antonio, a ford existed across Strawberry Creek beneath a clump of oak trees at approximately the intersection of Shattuck Avenue and Allston Way. The road or trail which crossed here connected the ranch houses of two of the Peralta brothers, Domingo and Vicente.\n\nFollowing the Mexican–American War, four Americans laid claim to four equal strips of land in what is now downtown Berkeley, bounded on the north by what is today the alignment of Addison Street, and on the south, by Dwight Way. Among these claimants was Francis K. Shattuck. Shattuck's portion lay west of what is now Shattuck Avenue. He built a house here at the site of what is today the Hotel Shattuck Plaza. The county road going to Oakland along his property was informally called \"Shattuck's road\", but the planners of the College of California dubbed the street \"Guyot\" on their plat map. That name never caught on and the street name was upgraded to \"Shattuck Avenue\". In the 1890s, Strawberry Creek was culverted through the downtown section, the oak trees were removed, and Shattuck and University Avenues were improved. Nonetheless, the area developed slowly until about the time of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, after which it developed rapidly.\n\nThe Central Pacific constructed its Berkeley Branch Railroad line connecting the area to the Oakland Pier and the transcontinental rail line in 1876, two years before the people living near the University of California and in Ocean View incorporated Berkeley. The end of the line at University Avenue was initially called the \"Terminus\" until the line was extended north, after which time it was called Berkeley Station. In the early years, downtown Berkeley was synonymous with \"Berkeley Station\", referring to the area around the railroad depot. The railroad served both passengers and freight at Berkeley Station. A telegraph office and Wells Fargo office were situated across the street from the depot.\n\nThe Key System opened up its electric train service to San Francisco from Downtown Berkeley in 1903. The Southern Pacific responded by electrifying and extending its lines in Berkeley in 1911 (East Bay Electric Lines) and moved its downtown freight operations just south of downtown to Ward Street and Shattuck. In 1941, however, SP ended its electric commuter train service. From then until April 1958, downtown Berkeley's commuter train service was solely in the hands of the Key System. Buses replaced the trains from 1958 to the present. In 1973, BART opened its own Berkeley station at Center Street and Shattuck, once again providing electric train service to San Francisco and elsewhere in the Bay Area.\n\nFor several years after the Key System's F train stopped running on Shattuck, its tracks (originally, the old SP tracks) remained in the pavement of Shattuck Avenue. Parking islands were created along the centerline of Shattuck overlapping the northbound tracks. In the early 1960s, a series of fountains were constructed which replaced some of these parking islands, extending from Center to Haste. The fountains quickly became the favorite targets of vandals who regularly put bubble bath in them. They were soon removed, just before Shattuck Avenue was torn up for the BART subway construction.\n\nIn early 2007 the Marine Recruiting Center for the northern Bay Area relocated from Alameda to downtown Berkeley in order to be closer to the University of California, Berkeley. This move was met with protests from Code Pink, prompted the city council to pass a 6-3 resolution calling the Marines \"uninvited and unwelcome intruders\", and led to United States Senator Jim DeMint attempting to pass legislation that would strip Berkeley of its $2,392,000 in federal funding.\n\nBerkeley's downtown section has been the principal commercial center of Berkeley since the railroad station was built. However, it has had to compete with the secondary commercial sections which emerged starting as early as the 19th century. Three of these in the past were West Berkeley (Ocean View), North Berkeley (Berryman's) and the Telegraph area immediately south of the University of California campus. Others which came a bit later were the Elmwood area along College near Ashby, San Pablo Avenue, South Berkeley (formerly the Lorin District) and Thousand Oaks along Solano Avenue.\n\nStarting in the 1970s it also had to compete with the emergence of major shopping centers and malls outside of Berkeley, especially El Cerrito Plaza, Hilltop Mall, and Emeryville. These resulted in the loss of several formerly prominent downtown businesses, including two large department stores; Hink's, whose building was converted to a movie theater and several smaller stores, and J. C. Penney. Contributing factors which continue to date are high commercial rents, a shortage of street parking and convenient garages, and higher consumer prices than those offered elsewhere. The latter has been a problem since the earliest days as there has always been a tendency to view the University population as a captive consumer base. The city has created an official arts district along Addison Street and passed laws restricting business hours in other neighborhoods in an attempt to increase night time activity downtown. To address the parking situation, the city is planning to install a system of digital signs to direct drivers to available parking spaces downtown.\n\nToday, Berkeley's downtown is highly eclectic, with numerous small businesses. Currently, the Berkeley City Council passed a new downtown area plan in an attempt to make the Downtown more sustainable and concentrate future development in the downtown area in conjunction with the announced plan of the University to build a hotel, conference center, and museum along Center Street. In 2009 local petition gatherers gained enough signatures to obstruct implementation of the plan, angering many residents of Berkeley, including the coalition of the Sierra Club, the Greenbelt Alliance, Berkeley Food & Housing Project and TransForm. The opponents argue that the new development calls for buildings that are too tall and have housing that is too expensive. Supporters of the downtown plan counter that the plan requires 20% affordable housing units and a denser downtown reduces carbon emissions.\n\nIn recent years, Shattuck Avenue has seen the opening of a number of new high-profile restaurants, such as Revival Bar and Kitchen.\n\nDowntown Berkeley is a part of Berkeley's District 4 and is represented by Kate Harrison. It is considered a left-leaning neighborhood in civic politics.\n\n"}

It is the main city centre and central business district of the city, Metro Vancouver, and the Lower Mainland regions. \n\nThe downtown area is generally considered to be bounded by Burrard Inlet to the north, Stanley Park and the West End to the west, False Creek to the south, and the Downtown Eastside to the east. Most sources include the full downtown peninsula (adding the West End neighbourhood and Stanley Park) as downtown Vancouver, but the City of Vancouver defines them as separate neighbourhoods.\n\nBesides the readily identifiable office towers of the financial and central business districts, Downtown Vancouver also includes residential neighbourhoods in the form of high-rise apartment and condominiums, in Yaletown and Coal Harbour. Other downtown neighbourhoods include the Granville Mall and Entertainment District, Downtown's South, Gastown, Japantown, and Chinatown.\n\nThe downtown area includes most of the remaining historic buildings and many of the larger notable buildings in the region.\n\nThere are two major sporting facilities in the downtown core, Rogers Arena (formerly GM Place) and BC Place Stadium. The NHL's Vancouver Canucks play at Rogers Arena, while the CFL's BC Lions and the MLS's Vancouver Whitecaps FC use the neighbouring BC Place Stadium. SkyTrain Stadium-Chinatown station provides easy rapid transit access to the district.\n\nThe presence of water on three sides limits access to downtown Vancouver. There are four major bridges: the Lions Gate Bridge, connecting to the North Shore municipalities and the Trans Canada Highway, the Burrard Street Bridge, Cambie Street Bridge, and Granville Street Bridge provides access to the commercial and residential areas south of False Creek.\n\nThe historic Waterfront station is the principal transit hub for the downtown core. There are six subway stations located in downtown Vancouver running on two SkyTrain lines: the Expo Line and Canada Line. The Expo Line travels from Waterfront station at the foot of the central harbor and through Dunsmuir Tunnel to the east. The Canada Line travels from Waterfront station and tunnels south under Granville Street and Davie Street, linking downtown to central Richmond and Vancouver International Airport. SeaBus is a passenger-only ferry that connects from Waterfront station to the North Shore in 10–12 minutes. The West Coast Express commuter rail system travels from Waterfront station to the eastern suburbs and exurbs. Terminals are also available near Waterfront station for float planes and helicopters.\n\nMost north-south Vancouver bus routes serve Downtown Vancouver, in addition to suburban routes from the North Shore and Burnaby. The bus rapid transit line 98 B-Line had eight stops in the downtown core, primarily along Seymour Street and Burrard Street. This service was replaced on August 17, 2009 by SkyTrain's Canada Line. The 95 B-Line started service in December 2016 in conjunction with the opening of the Evergreen Extension, connecting downtown to Simon Fraser University along Hastings Street.\n\nThere are two private passenger water taxi operators (False Creek Ferries and The Aquabus), providing service between several downtown neighbourhoods, False Creek, and Granville Island.\n\nThe city is planning to extend the downtown streetcar from its current route of Granville Island to the Main Street SkyTrain station, with future plans extending it to Chinatown and then to Stanley Park.\n\n"}

It is the oldest urban area in Winnipeg, and is home to the city's commercial core, city hall, the seat of Manitoba's provincial government, and a number of major attractions and institutions.\n\nThe City of Winnipeg's official downtown boundaries are: the Canadian Pacific Railway mainline on the north, Gomez Street and the Red River on the east, and the Assiniboine River on the south. The western boundaries are downtown are irregular, following along a number of different streets, back lanes, and across properties. Generally speaking, the western boundaries are rarely further west of Balmoral and Isabel Streets. In 2016, \"Canadian Geographic\" produced a map that generalize Winnipeg's downtown boundaries.\n\nNeighbourhoods in the downtown area include the Exchange District, Central Park, The Forks, and Chinatown. The downtown area is roughly three square kilometres. Winnipeg Square, Bell MTS Place, Portage Place, and the flagship store of the Bay are all located on the downtown section of Portage Avenue. On Main Street are Winnipeg's City Hall, Union Station, and the Manitoba Centennial Centre, which includes the Manitoba Museum, the Planetarium, the Centennial Concert Hall and the Winnipeg Railway Museum. Although over 60,000 people work downtown, only 13,470 people actually live in the Downtown area.\n\nThere are several residential projects under construction on Waterfront Drive and in the Exchange District, and the residential population of the area is projected to increase substantially in the next few years.\n\nThe \"Downtown Winnipeg Zoning By-Law\" defines the boundaries of the Downtown planning area, and several sectors within it. The downtown census area is slightly smaller, omitting a three-block extension at the north edge. There is also a significantly larger Downtown community area, used for Community Social Data Strategy for Winnipeg.\n\nThe Waterfront District is a newly emerging district located in the northeast corner of downtown Winnipeg. The area runs along the west bank of the Red River along the recently built Waterfront Drive and features Stephen Juba Park.\n\nThe Waterfront district has seen a number of residential construction projects since 2005.\n\nSunstone Boutique Hotels has an $11-million plan to build a three-storey, 67-room boutique hotel on what is now a gravel parking lot, along with a new casual-dining restaurant in the one-storey brick former Harbourmaster's building. The plans also involve construction of a public plaza area at the south end of the property.\n\nCentral Park is one of Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhoods with 13,755 people per square km according to Statistics Canada's 2001 Census. Seventy per cent of all refugees coming to Winnipeg live downtown, in and around the Central Park area. Central Park includes many different ethnicities including Arabs, Vietnamese, Chinese, Ojibway, Filipinos, and African (more than half being African).\n\nWith the increase in the African population, Central Park has been transforming in recent years. It is now the home to the 'Central Market', with more markets planned to come. Many of the markets will sell handmade fashion and imported African crafts.\n\nDuring warm Saturday nights, live entertainment fills the air, residents enjoy free Sunday movie screenings to enjoy an evening outdoors. The Knox Centre at Knox United Church presents international films in various languages - with English subtitles - every Thursday evening.\n\nThe Exchange District is a National Historic Site of Canada. Just one block north is one of Canada's most famous intersections, Portage and Main, the Exchange District comprises twenty city blocks and approximately 150 heritage buildings, and it is known for its intact turn-of-the-century collection of warehouses, financial institutions, and early terra cotta clad skyscrapers.\n\nWinnipeg's theatre district is located on the east side of the Exchange District, home to the Manitoba Theatre Centre, and Centennial Concert Hall which houses the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, and the Manitoba Opera. The west side of the Exchange is home to Cinematheque, a small movie theatre located in the Artspace building on Albert Street.\n\nThe Exchange District's Old Market Square annually hosts the Jazz Winnipeg Festival, the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, and the Manitoba Electronic Music Exhibition. Renovations to Old Market Square completed in 2012 added \"The Cube\", a new $1.5 million stage, with a skin made up of 20,000 aluminum links. The stage contains a built-in lighting system, green room and two performance levels.\n\nThe district is home to Red River College's Roblin Centre and Paterson Globalfoods Institute.\n\nBroadway-Assiniboine lies in the southern part of downtown on the north bank of the Assiniboine River. The neighbourhood is one of the more densely populated in Winnipeg, with 14,895 people per square kilometre. It features many notable landmarks such as the Hotel Fort Garry and the Manitoba Legislative Building. Broadway-Assiniboine features the \"Assiniboine Riverwalk\" and is home to many notable restaurants.\n\nThe population of Broadway-Assiniboine was 5,080 as of the 2006 Census. The most common transportation method of the people in South Portage is walking, with 41.1%, more than six and a half times higher than the overall 6.2% for Winnipeg. The average employment income for the area is just $28,818, which is lower than Winnipeg's average employment income of $33,518.\n\nThe Forks is a national historic, recreational, cultural and entertainment area site located in downtown Winnipeg where the Assiniboine and Red Rivers meet. The Forks was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1974 due to its status as a cultural landscape that had borne witness to six thousand years of human activity.\n\nSouth Portage is the group of blocks located between Portage Avenue, Main Street, Broadway and Memorial Boulevard.\n\nThe population of South Portage was 1,860 as of the 2006 Census. The most common transportation method of the people in South Portage is walking, with 34.4%, more than five times higher than the overall 6.2% for Winnipeg. The average employment income for the area is just $24,856, which is lower than Winnipeg's average employment income of $33,518.\n\nSouth Portage is the home of the main branch of the Winnipeg Public Library system, the four-storey Millennium Library. The area also boasts the Winnipeg Convention Centre which features of meeting, exhibition and banquet space. Opened in 2004, Winnipeg's MTS Centre is located just south of Portage Avenue and is home to the Winnipeg Jets. The area also features the Law Courts, cityplace mall and VJ's Drive Inn. There are numerous office buildings and hotels in this area, including some of Winnipeg's tallest buildings.\n\nWinnipeg's public transit hub is located on the Graham Avenue Transit Mall, as many bus routes converge there.\n\nFormed in 1909, the area is home to many shops and restaurants including Asian grocery stores and an herbal products store.\n\nWinnipeg's Chinatown covers northwest of City Hall and is home to about 600 people, of whom 90% are in the Chinese visible minority group. 40.5% of the area's residents speak neither English nor French (as compared to 1% of Winnipeg as a whole), while 71.1% of residents speak some variant of Chinese (including Cantonese, Mandarin and Chinese not otherwise specified).\n\nThe Winnipeg Walkway System, popularly known as the Winnipeg Skywalk, is a network of pedestrian skyways and tunnels connecting a significant portion of the city centre. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1467641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1467641", "title": "Family business", "text": "Family business\n\nA family business is a commercial organization in which decision-making is influenced by multiple generations of a family — related by blood or marriage or adoption — who has both the ability to influence the vision of the business and the willingness to use this ability to pursue distinctive goals. They are closely identified with the firm through leadership or ownership. Owner-manager entrepreneurial firms are not considered to be family businesses because they lack the multi-generational dimension and family influence that create the unique dynamics and relationships of family businesses.\n\nFamily business is the oldest and most common model of economic organization. The vast majority of businesses throughout the world—from corner shops to multinational publicly listed organizations with hundreds of thousands of employees—can be considered family businesses.\nBased on research of the Forbes 400 richest Americans, 44% of the Forbes 400 member fortunes were derived by being a member of or in association with a family business.\n\nThe economic prevalence and importance of this kind of business are often underestimated. Throughout most of the 20th century, academics and economists were intrigued by a newer, “improved” model: large publicly traded companies run in an apparently rational, bureaucratic manner by well trained “organization men.” Entrepreneurial and family firms, with their specific management models and complicated psychological processes, often fell short by comparison.\n\nPrivately owned or family-controlled enterprises are not always easy to study. In many cases, they are not subject to financial reporting requirements, and little information is made public about financial performance. Ownership may be distributed through trusts or holding companies, and family members themselves may not be fully informed about the ownership structure of their enterprise. However, as the 21st-century global economic model replaces the old industrial model, government policy makers, economists, and academics turn to entrepreneurial and family enterprises as a prime source of wealth creation and employment.\n\nIn some countries, many of the largest publicly listed firms are family-owned. A firm is said to be family-owned if a person is the controlling shareholder; that is, a person (rather than a state, corporation, management trust, or mutual fund) can garner enough shares to assure at least 20% of the voting rights and the highest percentage of voting rights in comparison to other shareholders. Some of the world's largest family-run businesses are Walmart (United States), Samsung Group (Korea) and Tata Group (India).\n\nThe \"Global Family Business Index\" comprises the largest 500 family firms around the globe. In this index—published for a first time in 2015 by Center for Family Business University of St. Gallen and EY—for a privately held firm, a firm is classified as a family firm in case a family controls more than 50% of the voting rights. For a publicly listed firm, a firm is classified as a family firm in case the family holds at least 32% of the voting rights.\n\nFamily owned businesses account for over 30% of companies with sales over $1 billion.\n\nIn a family business, two or more members within the management team are drawn from the owning family. Family businesses can have owners who are not family members. Family businesses may also be managed by individuals who are not members of the family. However, family members are often involved in the operations of their family business in some capacity and, in smaller companies, usually one or more family members are the senior officers and managers. In India, many businesses that are now public companies were once family businesses.\n\nFamily participation as managers and/or owners of a business can strengthen the company because family members are often loyal and dedicated to the family enterprise. However, family participation as managers and/or owners of a business can present unique problems because the dynamics of the family system and the dynamics of the business systems are often not in balance.\n\nThe interests of a family member may not be aligned with the interest of the business. For example, if a family member wants to be president but is not as competent as a non-family member, the personal interest of the family member and the well being of the business may be in conflict.\n\nThe interests of the entire family may not be balanced with the interests of their business. For example, if a family needs its business to distribute funds for living expenses and retirement but the business requires those to stay competitive, the interests of the entire family and the business are not aligned.\n\nFinally, the interest of one family member may not be aligned with another family member. For example, a family member who is an owner may want to sell the business to maximize their return, but a family member who is an owner and also a manager may want to keep the company because it represents their career and they want their children to have the opportunity to work in the company.\n\nThe challenge for business families is that family, ownership and business roles involve different and sometimes conflicting values, goals, and actions. For example, family members put a high priority on emotional capital—the family success that unites them through consecutive generations. Executives in the business are concerned about strategy and social capital—the reputation of their firm in the marketplace. Owners are interested in financial capital—performance in terms of wealth creation.\n\nA three-circles model is often used to show the three principal roles in a family-owned or -controlled organization: Family, Ownership and Management. This model shows how the roles may overlap.\n\nEveryone in the family (in all generations) obviously belongs to the Family circle, but some family members will never own shares in the family business, or ever work there. A family member is concerned with social capital (reputation within the community), dividends, and family unity.\n\nThe Ownership circle may include family members, investors and/or employee-owners. An owner is concerned with financial capital (business performance and dividends).\nThe Management circle typically includes non-family members who are employed by the family business. Family members may also be employees. An employee is concerned with social capital (reputation), emotional capital (career opportunities, bonuses and fair performance measures).\n\nA few people—for example, the founder or a senior family member—may hold all three roles: family member, owner and employee. These individuals are intensely connected to the family business, and concerned with any or all of the above sources of value creation.\n\nA genogram is an organization chart for the family. It is an enhanced family tree that shows not only family events like births and deaths, but also indicates the relationships (close, conflicted, cut-off, etc.) among individuals in the family. It is a useful tool for spotting relationship patterns across generations, and decrypting seemingly irrational behavior.\n\nFamily myths—sets of beliefs that are shared by the family members—can play important defensive and protective roles in families. Myths help people cope with stress and anxiety and, by prescribing ritualistic behavior patterns, will enable them to establish a common front against the outside world. They provide a rationale for the way people behave, but because much of what makes up a family myth takes place deep beneath the surface, they also conceal the true issues, problems, and conflicts. Although these family myths can turn into a blueprint for family action, they can also turn into straitjackets, reducing a family's flexibility and capacity to respond to new situations. (\"See also:\" Family nexus.)\n\nAll businesses require planning, but business families face the additional planning task of balancing family and business demands. There are five critical issues where the needs of the family and the demands of the business overlap—and require parallel planning action to ensure that business success does not create a family or business disaster.\n\nFairness is a fundamental issue in family business decision-making. Solutions that are perceived as fair by the family and business stakeholders are more likely to be accepted and supported. Fair process helps create organizational justice by engaging family members, whether as owners and employees, in a series of practical steps to address and resolve critical issues. Fair process lays a foundation for continued family participation over generations.\n\nThe challenge faced by family businesses and their stakeholders, is to recognise the issues that they face, understand how to develop strategies to address them and more importantly, to create narratives, or family stories that explain the emotional dimension of the issues to the family.\n\nThe most intractable family business issues are not the business problems the organisation faces, but the emotional issues that compound them. Many years of achievement through generations can be destroyed by the next, if the family fails to address the psychological issues they face. Applying psychodynamic concepts will help to explain behaviour and will enable the family to prepare for life cycle transitions and other issues that may arise. Family-run organisations need a new understanding and a broader perspective on the human dynamics of family firms with two complementary frameworks, psychodynamic and family systematic.\n\nWhen the family business is basically owned and operated by one person, that person usually does the necessary balancing automatically. For example, the founder may decide the business needs to build a new plant and take less money out of the business for a period so the business can accumulate cash needed to expand. In making this decision, the founder is balancing his personal interests (taking cash out) with the needs of the business (expansion).\n\nMost first generation owner/managers make the majority of the decisions. When the second generation (sibling partnership) is in control, the decision making becomes more consultative. When the larger third generation (cousin consortium) is in control, the decision making becomes more consensual, the family members often take a vote. In this manner, the decision making throughout generations becomes more rational.\n\nThe assets that are owned by the family, in most family businesses, are hard to separate from the assets\nthat belong to the business.\n\nBalancing competing interests often become difficult in three situations. The first situation is when the founder wants to change the nature of their involvement in the business. Usually the founder begins this transition by involving others to manage the business. Involving someone else to manage the company requires the founder to be more conscious and formal in balancing personal interests with the interests of the business because they can no longer do this alignment automatically—someone else is involved.\n\nThe second situation is when more than one person owns the business and no single person has the power and support of the other owners to determine collective interests. For example, if a founder intends to transfer ownership in the family business to their four children, two of whom work in the business, how do they balance these unequal differences? The four siblings need a system to do this themselves when the founder is no longer involved.\n\nThe third situation is when there are multiple owners and some or all of the owners are not in management. Given the situation above, there is a higher chance that the interests of the two off-spring not employed in the family business may be different from the interests of the two who are employed in the business. Their potential for differences does not mean that the interests cannot be aligned, it just means that there is a greater need for the four owners to have a system in place that differences can be identified and balanced.\n\nThese three scenarios can be mitigated by following the guidelines of TMP, or \"The Maria Principle\"\n\nThere appear to be two main factors affecting the development of family business and succession process: the size of the family, in relative terms the volume of business, and suitability to lead the organization, in terms of managerial ability, technical and commitment (Arieu, 2010).\nArieu proposed a model in order to classify family firms into four scenarios: political, openness, foreign management and natural succession.\n\nPotential successors who had professional experience outside the family business may decide to leave the firm to found a new one, either with or without the support of the family. Instead, successors tend to be characterized by professional experience only within the family business. The education of potential successors is a critical issue in the succession process because it affects the endowement of managerial capabilities of the firm.\n\nOne of the largest trends in family business is the number of women who are taking over their family firms. In the past, succession was reserved for the first-born son, then it moved on to any male heir. Now, women account for approx. 11-12% of all family firm leaders, an increase of close to 40% since 1996. Daughters are now considered to be one of the most underutilized resources in family businesses. To encourage the next generation of women to be valuable members of the business, potential female successors should be nurtured by assimilation into the family firm, mentoring, sharing of important tacit knowledge and having positive role models within the business.\n\nSuccessfully balancing the differing interests of family members and/or the interests of one or more family members on the one hand and the interests of the business on the other hand require the people involved to have the competencies, character and commitment to do this work.\n\nFamily-owned companies present special challenges to those who run them. They can be quirky, developing unique cultures and procedures as they grow and mature. That is fine, as long as they continue to be managed by people who are steeped in the traditions, or at least able to adapt to them.\n\nOften family members can benefit from involving more than one professional advisor, each having the particular skill set needed by the family. Some of the skill sets that might be needed include communication, conflict resolution, family systems, finance, legal, accounting, insurance, investing, leadership development, management development, and strategic planning.\n\nOwnership in a family business will also show maturity of the business. If all the shares rest with one individual, a family business is still in its infant stage, even if the revenue is strong.\n\n\n"}

This method of investing is based on the historic pricing patterns of mutual funds.\n\nBlake has attributed his participation in trading to a friend of his, who had shown him some municipal bonds and inquired for Blake's opinion. Blake noticed a trend in the numbers his colleague had showed him, and investigated further. His investigation led to the discovery that persistent trends in municipal bonds were decidedly systematic. This served as the basis of his mutual fund timing strategies. According to Barron's, Blake placed second in the U.S. Trading Championships in 1988 and first in 1989-1993.. This has been confirmed by Mr. Blake. [4] According to Andrew Selby’s posting on www.donttalkaboutyourstocks.com/market-wizard-gil-blake/ on February 26, 2013 his top five quotes from Gil Blake listed in Jack Schwager’s book Market Wizards (1992) were: Quote #1: \"I’m not a big fan of diversification. If the odds are 70 percent in your favor and you make fifty trades, it’s very difficult to have a down year.\" Quote #2: \"Whenever I take a position, I like to imagine what it would be like under the worst-case scenario. In doing so, I minimize the confusion if that situation actually develops. In my view, losses are a very important part of trading. When a loss happens, I believe in embracing it.\" Quote #3: \"The lesson for me was that if you break a discipline once, the next transgression becomes much easier. Breaking a diet provides an appropriate analogy – once you do it, it becomes much easier to make further exceptions.\" Quote #4: \"Opportunities change, strategies change, but people and psychology do not change. If trend following systems don’t work as well, something else will.

{"id": "1501312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1501312", "title": "Guarantee", "text": "Guarantee\n\nGuarantee is a legal term more comprehensive and of higher import than either warranty or \"security\". It most commonly designates a private transaction by means of which one person, to obtain some trust, confidence or credit for another, engages to be answerable for him. It may also designate a treaty through which claims, rights or possessions are secured. It is to be differentiated from the colloquial \"personal guarantee\" in that a Guarantee is a legal concept which produces an economic effect. A personal guarantee by contrast is often used to refer to a promise made by an individual which is supported by, or assured through, the word of the individual. In the same way, a guarantee produces a legal effect wherein one party affirms the promise of another (usually to pay) by promising to themselves pay if default occurs. \n\nAt law, the giver of a guarantee is called the surety or the \"guarantor\". The person to whom the guarantee is given is the creditor or the \"obligee\"; while the person whose payment or performance is secured thereby is termed \"the obligor\", \"the principal debtor\", or simply \"the principal\".\n\nSuretys have been classified as follows:\n\nGuarantee is sometimes spelt \"guarantie\" or \"guaranty\". It is from an Old French form of \"warrant\", from the Germanic word which appears in German as \"wahren\": to defend or make safe and binding.\n\nIn English law, a guarantee is a contract whereby the person (the guarantor) enters into an agreement to pay a debt, or effect the performance of some duty by a third person who is primarily liable for that payment or performance. The extent of the debt that the guarantor is liable to this debt is co-extensive to the obligation of the third-party. It is a collateral contract, which does not extinguish the original obligation for payment or performance and is secondary to the primary obligation. It is rendered null and void if the original obligation fails. Two forms of guarantee exists in England, (1) Guarantees creating a conditional payment, wherein if the principal fails, the guarantor will pay. Under this form, the guarantee is not enforceable until failure occurs. (2) A \"See-to-it\" obligation where the guarantor's obligation is to ensure that the principal will carry out the obligation. Failure of the principal to do so will automatically make the guarantor in breach of his contractual obligation, on which the creditor can sue.\n\nThe liabilities of a guarantor in law depend upon those of the principal debtor, and when the principal's obligations cease the guarantor's do too, except in certain cases where the discharge of the principal debtor is by the operation of the law. The co-extensive, secondary nature of the liability of the guarantor along with the fact that the guarantee is a contract to answer default, debt, or miscarriage; crucially differentiates the guarantee from an indemnity. If, for example, a person wrongly supposes that someone is liable to them, and a guarantee is given on that erroneous basis, the guarantee is invalid by virtue of the law of contracts, because its foundation (that another was liable) failed.\n\nNo special phraseology is necessary to form a guarantee. What distinguishes a guarantee from insurance is not any difference between the words \"insurance\" and \"guarantee\", but the substance of the contract entered into by the parties.\n\nThe statutory requisites of a guarantee are, in England, prescribed firstly by the statute of frauds, which provides in section 4 that \"no action shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another person, unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized\". This in effect means that the guarantee are not invalid but are merely unenforceable through a chose in personam. The requirement for a signature in writing was clarified in \"Elpis Maritimes Co v Marti Chartering Co Inc (the \"Maria D\") [1992] 1 AC 21\" and \"J Pereia Fernandes SA v Mehta [2006] EWHC 813 (Ch)\". In the latter, it was held that a contract was enforceable either by written agreement signed by the guarantor or his agent OR; if the guarantee was oral, a separate note or memorandum of the agreement could make the guarantee similarly enforceable. In the former, the court held it was sufficient that it was written or printed by the guarantor, a initial within an email was sufficient but a standard header name in an email was not. The court believed that the minor action was sufficient to engage the Statute as it had long been held that a single fingerprint, or \"X\" was sufficient. The Electronic Communications Act 2000 created a power to issue statutory instruments to modify legislation so as to be congruent with modern use of electronic communications. This is congruent with Article 9 of the EU Directive on Electronic Commerce 2000, this specifically allowed exceptions to the 'in writing' requirement of a guarantee. It has even been held that clicking a button to confirm personal details sufficiently discharges the Statute of Frauds requirement.\n\nThe second requisite is Lord Tenterden's Act which enacts that \"no action shall be brought whereby to charge any person upon or by reason of any representation or assurance made or given concerning or relating to the character, conduct, credit, ability, trade or dealings of any other person, to the intent or purpose that such other person may obtain credit, money or goods upon unless such representation or assurance be made in writing signed by the party to be charged therewith\". Lord Tenterden's Act, which applies to incorporated companies and to individual persons, was rendered necessary by an evasion of the statute of frauds, treating the guarantee for a debt, default or miscarriage, when not in writing as a fraudulent representation, giving rise to damages for a tort.\n\nThe statute of frauds does not invalidate a verbal guarantee, but renders it unenforceable. It may therefore be available to support a defense to an action, and money paid under it cannot be recovered. An indemnity is not a guarantee within the statute, unless it contemplates the primary liability of a third person. It need not, therefore, be in writing when it is only a promise to become liable for a debt if the person to whom the promise is made should become liable.\n\nNeither does the statute apply to the promise of a del credere agent to make no sales on behalf of his principal except to persons who are absolutely solvent, and renders the agent liable for any loss that may result from the non-fulfilment of his promise. A promise to give a guarantee is within the statute, though not one to procure a guarantee. The general principles which determine what are guarantees within the statute of frauds are: (1) the primary liability of a third person must exist or be contemplated; (2) the promise must be made to the creditor; (3) there must be no liability by the surety independent of an express promise of guarantee; (4) the main object of the parties to the guarantee must be the fulfilment of a third party's obligation; and (5) the contract entered into must not amount to a sale by the creditor to the promiser of the security for a debt or of the debt itself\n\nAs regards the kind of note or memorandum of the guarantee that will satisfy the statute of frauds, \"no special promise to be made, by any person after the passing of this act, to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person, being in writing and signed by the party to be charged, or some other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized, shall be deemed invalid to support an action, suit or other proceeding, to charge the person by whom such promise shall have been made, by reason only that the consideration for such promise does not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document.\" Any writing embodying the terms of the agreement between the parties and signed by the party to be charged is sufficient; and the idea of agreement need not be present to the mind of the person signing. It is, however, necessary that the names of the contracting parties should appear somewhere in writing; that the party to be charged, or his agent, should sign the agreement or another paper referring to it; and that, when the note or memorandum is made, a complete agreement shall exist. The memorandum need not be contemporaneous with the agreement itself.\n\nIn the United States, but not apparently elsewhere, there is a distinction between a surety and a guarantor. A surety is usually bound with the principal, at the same time and on the same consideration, while the contract of a guarantor is his own separate undertaking and the guarantor is not liable until due diligence has been exerted to compel the principal debtor to make good any default. There is no privity of contract between a surety and the principal debtor. Rather, the surety contracts with the creditor and is not jointly liable to the creditor.\n\nIn India a guarantee may be either oral or written while in Australia, Jamaica and Sri Lanka it must be in writing.\n\nIn the Irish Statute of Frauds there are provisions identical with that found in the English Statute of Frauds.\n\nAccording to various existing civil codes, a suretyship, when the underlying obligation is \"non-valuable\", is null and void unless the invalidity is the result of personal incapacity of the principal debtor In some countries, however, the mere personal incapacity of a minor to borrow suffices to eliminate the guarantee of a loan made to him The Egyptian codes sanction guarantees expressly entered into \"in view of debtor's want of legal capacity\" to contract a valid principal obligation The Portuguese code retains the surety's liability, in respect of an invalid principal obligation, until the latter has been legally rescinded\n\nAccording to several codes civil sureties are divided into conventional, legal and judicial, while the Spanish code further divides them into gratuitous and for valuable consideration.\n\nThe German code civil requires the surety's promise to be verified by writing where he has not executed the principal obligation. The Portuguese code renders a guarantee provable by all the modes established by law for the proof of the principal contract According to most civil codes civil a guarantee like any other contract can usually be made verbally in the presence of witnesses and in certain cases (where for instance considerable sums of money are involved) \"sous signature privee\" or by a judicial or notarial instrument. The French and Belgian Codes, moreover, provide that suretyship is not to be presumed but must always be expressed\n\nIn England the common-law requisites of a guarantee are the same as any other contract. The mutual assent of two or more parties, competency to contract and valuable consideration. An offer to guarantee must be accepted, either by express or implied acceptance.\n\nIf a surety's assent to a guarantee has been procured by fraud by the person to whom it is given, there is no binding contract. Fraud may consist of suppression, concealment or misrepresentation. However, only facts that are really material to the risk undertaken need be spontaneously disclosed. The competency of the parties to enter into a contract of guarantee may be affected by insanity or intoxication of the surety, if known to the creditor, or by any disability. The ordinary disabilities are those of minors.\n\nIn some guarantees the consideration is \"entire\". For example, in consideration for a lease being granted, the surety becomes answerable for the performance of the covenants of the lease. In other cases it is \"fragmentary\" or supplied from time to time, as where a guarantee is given to secure the balance of a running account at a bank, for goods supplied When the consideration is \"entire\", the guarantee runs on through the duration of the lease and is irrevocable. When the consideration is \"fragmentary\", unless the guarantee stipulates to the contrary, the surety may at any time terminate his liability under the guarantee.\n\nTotal failure of consideration or illegal consideration by the party giving a guarantee will prevent its being enforced. Though in all countries the mutual assent of two or more parties is essential to the formation of any contract, a consideration is not everywhere regarded as a necessary element. Thus in Scotland a contract may be binding without a consideration to support it.\n\nThe liability incurred by a surety under his guarantee depends upon its terms, and is not necessarily coextensive with that of the principal debtor. It is, however, obvious that the surety's obligation cannot exceed that of the principal. By many existing civil codes, however, a guarantee which imposes on the surety a greater liability than that of the principal is not invalidated but is merely reducible to that of the principal. However, in India the liability of the surety is, unless otherwise provided by contract, coextensive with that of the principal.\n\nWhere the liability of the surety is less extensive in amount than that of the principal debtor, questions have arisen in England and America as to whether the surety is liable only for part of the debt equal to the limit of his liability, or, up to such limit, for the whole debt. The surety cannot be made liable except for a loss sustained by reason of the default guaranteed against. Moreover, in the case of a joint and several guarantee by several sureties, unless all sign it none are liable thereunder. The limit of the surety's liability must be construed so as to give effect to what may fairly be inferred to have been the intention of the parties as expressed in writing. In cases of doubtful import, recourse to parol evidence is permissible, to explain, but not to contradict, the written evidence of the guarantee.\n\nAs a general rule, the surety is not liable if the principal debt cannot be enforced. It has never been actually decided in England whether this rule holds good in cases where the principal debtor is a minor and on that account is not liable to the creditor. When directors guarantee the performance by their company of a contract which is beyond their authority, and therefore not binding on the company, the directors' liability is enforceable against them personally.\n\nIt is not always easy to determine for how long liability under a guarantee endures. Sometimes a guarantee is limited to a single transaction, and is obviously intended to be security against one specific default only. On the other hand, it as often happens that it is not exhausted by one transaction on the faith of it, but extends to a series of transactions, and remains a standing security until it is revoked, either by the act of the parties or by the death of the surety. It is then termed a continuing guarantee.\n\nNo fixed rules of interpretation determine whether a guarantee is a continuing one or not, but each case must be judged on its individual merits. Frequently, in order to achieve a correct construction, it becomes necessary to examine the surrounding circumstances, which often reveal what was the subject matter which the parties contemplated when the guarantee was given, and what was the scope and object of the transaction between them. Most continuing guarantees are either ordinary business securities for advances made or goods supplied to the principal debtor or else bonds for the good behavior of persons in public or private offices or employment. With regard to the latter class of continuing guarantees, the surety's liability is, generally speaking, revoked by any change in the constitution of the persons to or for whom the guarantee is given. In England the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to vary the character of any security, for good behavior by the heads of public departments given by companies for the due performance of the duties of an office or employment in the public service.\n\nBefore the surety can be rendered liable on his guarantee, the principal debtor must have made default. When, however, this has occurred, the creditor, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, may sue the surety, without informing him of such default having taken place before proceeding against the principal debtor or resorting to securities for the debt received from the latter. In those countries where the municipal law is based on the Roman law, sureties usually possess the right (which may, however, be renounced by them) of compelling the creditor to insist on the goods, etc. (if any) of the principal debtor being first \"discussed,\" i.e., appraised and sold, and appropriated to the liquidation of the debt guaranteed before having recourse to the sureties. This right \"accords with a common sense of justice and the natural equity of mankind\". In England this right has never been fully recognized, nor does it prevail in America and Scotland.\n\nIn England, however, before any demand for payment has been made by the creditor on the surety, the latter can, as soon as the principal debtor has made default, compel the creditor, on giving him an indemnity against costs and expenses, to sue the principal debtor if the latter is solvent and able to pay. and a similar remedy is also open to the surety in America. In neither of these countries nor in Scotland can one of several sureties, when sued for the whole guaranteed debt by the creditor, compel the latter to divide his claim among the sureties, and reduce it to the share and proportion of each surety. However, this \"beneficium divisionis\", as it is called in Roman law, is recognized by many existing codes.\n\nThe usual mode in England of enforcing liability under a guarantee is by action in the High Court or a County Court. It is also permissible for the creditor to obtain redress by means of a set-off or counterclaim, in an action brought against him by the surety. On the other hand, the surety may now, in any court in which the action on the guarantee is pending, avail himself of any set-off which may exist between the principal debtor and the creditor. Moreover, if one of several sureties for the same debt is sued by the creditor or his guarantee, he can, by means of a third-party complaint, claim contribution from his co-sureties towards the common liability. Independent proof of the surety's liability under his guarantee must always be given at the trial. The creditor cannot rely on admissions made by or a judgment or award against the principal debtor.\n\nA person liable as a surety for another under a guarantee possesses rights against the person to whom the guarantee was given. As regards the surety's rights against the principal debtor, where the guarantee was made with the debtors consent but not otherwise, after he has made default, be compelled by the surety to exonerate him from liability by payment of the guaranteed debt. If the surety has paid any portion of the guaranteed debt, the surety is entitled to rank as a creditor for the amount paid and to compel repayment.\n\nIn the event of the principal debtor's bankruptcy, the surety can in England act against the bankrupt's estate, not only in respect of payments made before the bankruptcy of the principal debtor, but also, it seems, in respect of the contingent liability to pay under the guarantee. If the creditor has already acted, the surety who has paid the guaranteed debt has a right to all dividends received by the creditor from the bankrupt in respect to the guaranteed debt, and to stand in the creditor's place as to future dividends. The rights of the surety against the creditor are in England exercisable even by one who in the first instance was a principal debtor, but has since become a surety, by arrangement with his creditor.\n\nThe surety's principal right against the creditor entitles him, after payment of the guaranteed debt, to the benefit of all securities which the creditor held against the principal debtor. If the creditor has lost these securities by default or laches or rendered them otherwise unavailable, the surety is discharged pro tanto. This right, which is not in abeyance till the surety is called on to pay extends to all securities, whether satisfied or not. \"[E]very person who being surety for the debt or duty of another, or being liable with another for any debt or duty, shall pay such debt or perform such duty, shall be entitled to have assigned to him, or to a trustee for him, every judgment, specialty, or other security, which shall be held by the creditor in respect of such debt or duty, whether such judgment, specialty, or other security shall or shall not be deemed at law to have been satisfied by the payment of the debt or performance of the duty, and such person shall be entitled to stand in the place of the creditor, and to use all the remedies, and, if need be, and upon a proper indemnity, to use the name of the creditor, in any action or other proceeding at law or in equity, in order to obtain from the principal debtor, or any co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, as the case may be, indemnification for the advances made and loss sustained by the person who shall have so paid such debt or performed such duty; and such payment or performance so made by such surety shall not be pleadable in bar of any such action or other proceeding by him, provided always that no co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor shall be entitled to recover from any other co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, by the means aforesaid, more than the just proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, such last-mentioned person shall be justly liable\". The right of the surety to be subrogated on payment by him of the guaranteed debt, to all the rights of the creditor against the principal debtor is recognized in America and many other countries.\n\nA surety is entitled to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their common liability. This particular right is not the result of any contract, but is derived from a equity, on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor in the case of a surety for a surety; nor where a person becomes a surety jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt; and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of a surety, proof can be made against his estate by a co-surety for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor.\n\nThe Roman law did not recognize the right of contribution among sureties. It is, however, sanctioned by many existing codes.\n\nThe most prolific ground of discharge of a guarantor usually arises from the creditor's conduct. The governing principle is that if the creditor violates any rights which the surety possessed when he entered into the suretyship, even though the damage is only nominal, the guarantee cannot be enforced. The surety's discharge may be accomplished (1) by a variation of the terms of the contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, or of that between the creditor and the surety; (2) by the creditor taking a new security from the principal debtor in lieu of the original one; (3) by the creditor discharging the principal debtor from liability; (4) by the creditor binding himself to give time to the principal debtor for payment of the guaranteed debt; or (5) by loss of securities received by the creditor in respect of the guaranteed debt. The first four of these acts are collectively termed a novation. In general whatever extinguishes the principal obligation necessarily determines that of the surety, not only in England but elsewhere. By most civil codes the surety is discharged by conduct of the creditor inconsistent with the surety's rights, although the rule prevailing in England, Scotland, America and India which releases the surety from liability when the creditor extends without the surety's consent the time for fulfilling the principal obligation, while recognized by two existing codes civil, is rejected by the majority of them. A revocation of the contract of suretyship by act of the parties, or in certain cases by the death of the surety, may also operate to discharge the surety.\n\nThe death of a surety does not per se determine the guarantee, but, save where from its nature the guarantee is irrevocable by the surety himself, it can be revoked by express notice after his death, or by the creditor becoming receiving constructive notice of the death; except where, under the testator's will, the executor has the option of continuing the guarantee, in which case the executor should specifically withdraw the guarantee in order to terminate it. If one of a number of joint and several sureties dies, the future liability of the survivors continues, at least until it has been terminated by express notice. In such a case, however, the estate of the deceased surety would be relieved from liability. The statute of limitations may bar the right of action on guarantees subject to variation by statute in any U.S. state where the guarantee is sought to be enforced.\n\n\n"}

Before their child's first birthday, Betty died age 25.\n\nLeaving his son behind, James Ainslie traveled to New South Wales, Australia in the ship \"Admiral Cockburn\", arriving in February 1825. He was recruited by Robert Campbell in 1825 to establish a sheep station in the Limestone Plains of New South Wales. On his way from Bathurst to find an appropriate site for a sheep station, Ainslie and his convict labourers came across a terrified group of Aboriginal Australians near Booroowa. It is said that the Indigenous people had never seen sheep or white people before and believing Ainslie to be a dead spirit \"sacrificed\" a woman to him, who they had earlier \"stolen\" from down on the Yass plains. Ainslie was guided to the south-east by that woman and established Campbell's property, later named Duntroon in the area of present-day Canberra.\n\nIn 1827 the unknown woman and James Ainslie had a daughter, called Ju Nin Mingo - or Nanny. \n\nAinslie ran Campbell's sheep station for around a decade, turning his flock of sheep from Bathurst into a flock of 20,000 (after sales). It was during this time that Mount Ainslie was named after him. \n\nIn January 1835, Robert Campbell announced there had been \"irregularities and insubordination...occasioned by a [liquor] Store on a neighbouring Farm\" and made it known that he would henceforth pay no more orders drawn by Mr Ainslie. Within two months of the announcement, Ainslie was making preparations to leave Australia. He advertised in the \"Sydney Herald\" that he was about to \"quit the Colony\". \n\nLeaving behind his partner and his daughter, Ainslie sailed on the \"Edinburgh\" to Liverpool, England from Sydney, departing 16 March 1835. From Liverpool, he made his way back to the Scottish Borders.\n\nBetween 1835 and 1844 Ainslie was often in trouble with the law including for assaults and public nuisance. In 1841, court documents were prepared stating that Ainslie had \"came home to see his son with the intention of returning to the Colony... but he has not yet found it convenient to return\".\n\nOn 11 April 1844, Ainslie committed suicide in Jedburgh Castle Jail aged 60. He hanged himself while awaiting trial for a charge of assault.\n\n"}

His wife was \"RMS Titanic\" survivor Molly Brown.\n\nJ.J. was born in Waymart, Pennsylvania. His father, James Brown, was an Irish immigrant. His mother, Cecilia Palmer, was a schoolteacher. J.J's family moved to Pittston, Pennsylvania shortly after his birth. J.J's mother home-schooled him and later sent him to St. John's Academy. He left home at the age of 23, lured by the riches in the West. His first stop was a farm in Nebraska. From Nebraska he moved to the placer mines in the Dakotas. He spent two years learning the mining trade before moving to Colorado where he tried his luck in Georgetown, Aspen, and Ashcroft. He spent another two years in the Aspen and Ashcroft area before moving to Alma, Fairplay, Red Cliff, and, finally, Leadville. He studied geology, ore deposits, and mining techniques to become a better miner.\n\nJ.J. married Margaret Tobin on September 1, 1886, in Leadville's Annunciation Church. Margaret was later known as \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" when a Broadway fictionalized movie about her life titled, \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" was released in 1964. That was how Margaret's moniker \"Molly\" was acquired. Margaret Brown was one of the survivors of the RMS Titanic sinking in 1912. At the time of their marriage, J.J. was 31 and Margaret was 19. They first settled in Leadville, Colorado in a small, two-room log cabin, then later moved to a two bedroom house at 320 East Ninth Street.\n\nThe Browns had two children. Their first child, Lawrence Palmer Brown, nicknamed Larry, was born on August 30, 1887 in his maternal grandparents' four room cottage near the Mississippi River in Hannibal, Missouri. Larry married Eileen Elizabeth Horton (1890–1985) on January 1, 1911 in Kansas City, Missouri. They had two children, Lawrence Palmer \"Pat\" Brown Jr. (1911–1976) and Elizabeth \"Betty\" Brown (1913–1974). The marriage failed and Larry married Hollywood actress Mildred Gregory (1895–1956) on November 17, 1926 in Beverly Hills, California. This marriage produced no other children. Larry died on April 2, 1949. J.J. and Margaret's second child, Catherine Ellen Brown, nicknamed Helen, was born on July 22, 1889 in her parents' three bedroom house at 322 West Seventh Street in Leadville, Colorado. She married George Joseph Peter Adelheid Benziger (1877–1970) on April 7, 1913 in Chicago, Illinois. Her children were James George Benziger (1914–1995) and George Peter Joseph Adelrich Benziger (1917–1985). Her grandchildren include Bradford Benziger (born December 13, 1944), Katherine Benziger (born July 12, 1947), Vincent Benziger (born August 3, 1950), Pamela Benziger Feeley (born 1946), Alice Lynne Davy (born 1948), Helen Anne Benziger (born 1950) and Heidi Rautio (born 1952). Helen died on September 18, 1970 Jackson County Nursing Home Carbondale, Jackson County Illinois.\n\nIn 1909, after 23 years of marriage, J.J. and Molly signed a separation agreement and went their separate ways. The agreement gave Margaret a cash settlement and possession of the Victorian mansion on Pennsylvania Street in Denver's Wealthy Capital Hill neighborhood, and also the summer mansion Avoca Lodge in Southwest Denver, near Bear Creak. She also received a $700 monthly allowance (equivalent to $19,066 today) to continue her travels and philanthropic activities. Although they never reconciled, they remained connected and cared for each other throughout their lives. At the time of J.J.'s death in 1922, Margaret told newspapers, \"I've never met a finer, bigger, more worthwhile man than J.J. Brown.\"\n\nAlthough J.J. was not born into wealth, he was ambitious, smart, and charismatic. He quickly rose through the mining ranks to shift-boss and timberman. He was foreman of the Louisville Mine by the time he and Margaret met. By 1887 he was superintendent of the Louisville Mine, and in 1888 he was superintendent of the Henriette & Maid Consolidated Mining Company, at the time one of the most productive mines in the area.\n\nThe Brown family came into great wealth when J.J's engineering efforts proved instrumental in the production of a substantial gold and copper seam at the Little Jonny mine of his employers, Ibex Mining Company.\n\nJ.J., who was the superintendent of all the Ibex properties, devised a method of using baled hay and timbers to stop cave-ins. His invention paid off. When the Little Jonny mine opened, vast quantities of high-grade copper and gold were found. The grade of gold was so pure and the vein so wide that it was heralded as the world's richest gold strike. By October 29, 1893, the Little Jonny was shipping 135 tons of gold ore per day. J.J. was awarded 12,500 shares or 12.5% of stock and a seat on the board. The Ibex Company and its owners, including the Browns, became extraordinarily wealthy. In 1894, the Browns moved to Denver, Colorado, buying a $30,000 Victorian mansion in Denver's wealthy Capitol Hill neighborhood. In 1897, they built a summer mansion Avoca Lodge in Southwest Denver, near Bear Creak.\n\nOn September 5, 1922, J.J. died after suffering a series of heart attacks at a hospital in Nassau, New York, with his daughter Catherine by his side. He died without a will, and it took 5 years of fighting between Margaret and her two children to settle the estate. Due to their lavish spending, J.J. left an estate valued at only $238,000 (worth $ today). Margaret was to receive $20,000 in cash and securities, and the interest on a $100,000 trust fund set up in her name. $118,000 was divided between her two children. Her son Lawrence received a $59,000 (worth $ today) trust fund, and her daughter Catherine received a $59,000 trust fund. From that time until her death in 1932, Margaret had no contact with her two children (but Margaret's page says they were reconciled). Both J.J. and Margaret are buried in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, New York.\n"}

He graduated from Finnish Cadet School in Hamina in 1896. During his studies he served as ensign in 132nd Bender Infantry Regiment. He was later promoted lieutenant in 1907 when he was already in reserve. Stjernvall continued his studies in Polytechnic Institute in Helsinki and graduated in 1900 as Mechanical Engineer.\n\nDuring 1904–1914 Stjernvall led technical office of Siemens & Halske in Helsinki; in this period the company built the first steam turbine power plant of Finland in Tampere and connected Sveaborg to electrical grid through an undersea cable. Stjernvall represented nobility and chivalry in Diet of Finland in 1904–1905. In 1914, shortly before the First World War Stjernvall moved to Kone- ja Siltarakennus (Kone ja Silta) as Deputy Director. Due to intense arms race between the European superpowers prior the war, the company had a good order backlog from the Russian military; Kone ja Silta produced munition and other military supplies, and repaired ships of the Imperial Russian Navy. Stjernvall became company manager in 1917. In the same year Finland became independent. In 1918 Swedish People's Party of Finland asked him to join in Lauri Ingman's cabinet as Minister of Trade and Industry. Stjernvall agreed, but the cabinet turned out to be short-living, and already after few months, he was back.\n\nKone ja Silta grew strongly during Stjernvall's time. In 1923 the company started producing Abloy locks. Kone ja Silta took over Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works on 22 December 1926. The articles of association were changed uniform with Kone ja Silta in December 1927, after which both companies shared the same management.\n\nIn 1928–1929 the company turnover reached 90 million marks and made 3 million marks' profit. At the time Kone ja Silta employed 1 300 people.\n\nStjernvall was entitled vuorineuvos in 1924.\n\nStjernvall handed over his managerial post of Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering works to Robert Lavonius on 1 April 1929. At the end of the same year he submitted his resignation to Kone ja Silta for health reasons.\n\nAfter his resignation, Stjernvall continued in positions of trust in Helsingin Osakepankki (HOP). Between 1918 and 1939 Stjernvall was twice the chairman of the Board.\n\nStjernvall had no family. A street was named after him, Stjernvallintie in Kulosaari, until it was renamed Vuorineuvoksentie in 1958.\n"}

It is part of the Lagos Division. As of the preliminary 2006 Nigerian census, the LGA had a population of 209,437 in an area of 8.7 km². The LGA only covers the western half of Lagos Island; the eastern half is under the jurisdiction of the LGA of Eti-Osa.\n\nLying on Lagos Lagoon, a large protected harbour on the coast of Africa, the island was home to the Yoruba fishing village of Eko, which grew into the modern city of Lagos. The city has now spread out to cover the neighbouring islands as well as the adjoining mainland.\n\nLagos Island is connected to the mainland by three large bridges which cross Lagos Lagoon to the district of Ebute Metta. It is also linked to the neighbouring island of Ikoyi and to Victoria Island. The Lagos harbour district of Apapa faces the western side of the island. Forming the main commercial district of Lagos, Lagos Island plays host to the main government buildings, shops and offices. The Catholic and Anglican Cathedrals as well as the Central Mosque are located here.\n\nHistorically, Lagos Island (Isale Eko) was home to the Brazilian Quarter of Lagos where the majority of the slave trade returnees from Brazil settled. Many families lived on Broad Street in the Marina.\nThe poorer eastern side of the island contains the main markets and the poorer housing. The island is extremely crowded and congested and attempts have been made to build new roads out over the lagoon in order to improve traffic flows. It is the part of Lagos where the Oba (or king) of Lagos resides. It is also believed that the Eyo festival can only be held in this part of Lagos.\n\nMost Nigerian banks' head offices are located on Lagos Island.\nFirst Bank of Nigeria is one of the Nigerian banks with its head office in Marina, Lagos Island. Another bank that has its head office situated in Lagos Island is United Bank for Africa (UBA). Other medium and large-scale businesses such as real estate consultancy firms, electrical appliances manufacturers and retail stores are based in Marina, Lagos Island.\n\nLocated on Nnamdi Azikiwe Street, Idumota, formerly Victoria St, Tom Jones Memorial hall is noteworthy as the venue of the call for positive action by zikists in November 1948.

{"id": "18933632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18933632", "title": "Metadata", "text": "Metadata\n\nMetadata is \"data [information] that provides information about other data\". Many distinct types of metadata exist, among these descriptive metadata, structural metadata, administrative metadata, reference metadata and statistical metadata\n\n\nMetadata was traditionally used in the card catalogs of libraries until the 1980s, when libraries converted their catalog data to digital databases. In the 2000s, as digital formats were becoming the prevalent way of storing data and information, metadata was also used to describe digital data using metadata standards.\n\nThe first description of \"meta data\" for computer systems is purportedly noted by MIT's Center for International Studies experts David Griffel and Stuart McIntosh in 1967: \"In summary then, we have statements in an object language about subject descriptions of data and token codes for the data. We also have statements in a meta language describing the data relationships and transformations, and ought/is relations between norm and data.\" \n\nThere are different metadata standards for each different discipline (e.g., museum collections, digital audio files, websites, etc.). Describing the contents and context of data or data files increases its usefulness. For example, a web page may include metadata specifying what software language the page is written in (e.g., HTML), what tools were used to create it, what subjects the page is about, and where to find more information about the subject. This metadata can automatically improve the reader's experience and make it easier for users to find the web page online. A CD may include metadata providing information about the musicians, singers and songwriters whose work appears on the disc.\n\nA principal purpose of metadata is to help users find relevant information and discover resources. Metadata also helps to organize electronic resources, provide digital identification, and support the archiving and preservation of resources. Metadata assists users in resource discovery by \"allowing resources to be found by relevant criteria, identifying resources, bringing similar resources together, distinguishing dissimilar resources, and giving location information.\" Metadata of telecommunication activities including Internet traffic is very widely collected by various national governmental organizations. This data is used for the purposes of traffic analysis and can be used for mass surveillance.\n\nIn many countries, the metadata relating to emails, telephone calls, web pages, video traffic, IP connections and cell phone locations are routinely stored by government organizations.\n\n\nFor example, a digital image may include metadata that describes how large the picture is, the color depth, the image resolution, when the image was created, the shutter speed, and other data. A text document's metadata may contain information about how long the document is, who the author is, when the document was written, and a short summary of the document. Metadata within web pages can also contain descriptions of page content, as well as key words linked to the content. These links are often called \"Metatags\", which were used as the primary factor in determining order for a web search until the late 1990s. The reliance of metatags in web searches was decreased in the late 1990s because of \"keyword stuffing\". Metatags were being largely misused to trick search engines into thinking some websites had more relevance in the search than they really did.\n\nMetadata can be stored and managed in a database, often called a metadata registry or metadata repository. However, without context and a point of reference, it might be impossible to identify metadata just by looking at it. For example: by itself, a database containing several numbers, all 13 digits long could be the results of calculations or a list of numbers to plug into an equation - without any other context, the numbers themselves can be perceived as the data. But if given the context that this database is a log of a book collection, those 13-digit numbers may now be identified as ISBNs - information that refers to the book, but is not itself the information within the book. The term \"metadata\" was coined in 1968 by Philip Bagley, in his book \"Extension of Programming Language Concepts\" where it is clear that he uses the term in the ISO 11179 \"traditional\" sense, which is \"structural metadata\" i.e. \"data about the containers of data\"; rather than the alternative sense \"content about individual instances of data content\" or metacontent, the type of data usually found in library catalogues. Since then the fields of information management, information science, information technology, librarianship, and GIS have widely adopted the term. In these fields the word \"metadata\" is defined as \"data about data\". While this is the generally accepted definition, various disciplines have adopted their own more specific explanation and uses of the term.\n\nWhile the metadata application is manifold, covering a large variety of fields, there are specialized and well-accepted models to specify types of metadata. Bretherton & Singley (1994) distinguish between two distinct classes: structural/control metadata and guide metadata. \"Structural metadata\" describes the structure of database objects such as tables, columns, keys and indexes. \"Guide metadata\" helps humans find specific items and are usually expressed as a set of keywords in a natural language. According to Ralph Kimball metadata can be divided into 2 similar categories: technical metadata and business metadata. \"Technical metadata\" corresponds to internal metadata, and \"business metadata\" corresponds to external metadata. Kimball adds a third category, \"process metadata\". On the other hand, NISO distinguishes among three types of metadata: descriptive, structural, and administrative.\n\n\"Descriptive metadata\" is typically used for discovery and identification, as information to search and locate an object, such as title, author, subjects, keywords, publisher. \"Structural metadata\" describes how the components of an object are organized. An example of structural metadata would be how pages are ordered to form chapters of a book. Finally, \"administrative metadata\" gives information to help manage the source. Administrative metadata refers to the technical information, including file type, or when and how the file was created. Two sub-types of administrative metadata are rights management metadata and preservation metadata. \"Rights management metadata\" explains intellectual property rights, while \"preservation metadata\" contains information to preserve and save a resource.\n\nStatistical data repositories have their own requirements for metadata in order to describe not only the source and quality of the data but also what statistical processes were used to create the data, which is of particular importance to the statistical community in order to both validate and improve the process of statistical data production.\n\nAn additional type of metadata beginning to be more developed is \"accessibility metadata\". \"Accessibility metadata\" is not a new concept to libraries; however, advances in universal design have raised its profile. Projects like Cloud4All and GPII identified the lack of common terminologies and models to describe the needs and preferences of users and information that fits those needs as a major gap in providing universal access solutions.. Those types of information are accessibility metadata. Schema.org has incorporated several accessibility properties based on IMS Global Access for All Information Model Data Element Specification. The Wiki page WebSchemas/Accessibility lists several properties and their values.\n\nWhile the efforts to describe and standardize the varied accessibility needs of information seekers are beginning to become more robust their adoption into established metadata schemas has not been as developed. For example, while Dublin Core (DC)'s “audience” and MARC 21's “reading level” could be used to identify resources suitable for users with dyslexia and DC's “Format” could be used to identify resources available in braille, audio, or large print formats, there is more work to be done.\n\nMetadata (metacontent) or, more correctly, the vocabularies used to assemble metadata (metacontent) statements, is typically structured according to a standardized concept using a well-defined metadata scheme, including: metadata standards and metadata models. Tools such as controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, data dictionaries, and metadata registries can be used to apply further standardization to the metadata. Structural metadata commonality is also of paramount importance in data model development and in database design.\n\nMetadata (metacontent) syntax refers to the rules created to structure the fields or elements of metadata (metacontent). A single metadata scheme may be expressed in a number of different markup or programming languages, each of which requires a different syntax. For example, Dublin Core may be expressed in plain text, HTML, XML, and RDF.\n\nA common example of (guide) metacontent is the bibliographic classification, the subject, the Dewey Decimal class number. There is always an implied statement in any \"classification\" of some object. To classify an object as, for example, Dewey class number 514 (Topology) (i.e. books having the number 514 on their spine) the implied statement is: \"<nowiki><book><subject heading><514></nowiki>. This is a subject-predicate-object triple, or more importantly, a class-attribute-value triple. The first two elements of the triple (class, attribute) are pieces of some structural metadata having a defined semantic. The third element is a value, preferably from some controlled vocabulary, some reference (master) data. The combination of the metadata and master data elements results in a statement which is a metacontent statement i.e. \"metacontent = metadata + master data\". All of these elements can be thought of as \"vocabulary\". Both metadata and master data are vocabularies which can be assembled into metacontent statements. There are many sources of these vocabularies, both meta and master data: UML, EDIFACT, XSD, Dewey/UDC/LoC, SKOS, ISO-25964, Pantone, Linnaean Binomial Nomenclature, etc. Using controlled vocabularies for the components of metacontent statements, whether for indexing or finding, is endorsed by ISO 25964: \"If both the indexer and the searcher are guided to choose the same term for the same concept, then relevant documents will be retrieved.\" This is particularly relevant when considering search engines of the internet, such as Google. The process indexes pages then matches text strings using its complex algorithm; there is no intelligence or \"inferencing\" occurring, just the illusion thereof.\n\nMetadata schemata can be hierarchical in nature where relationships exist between metadata elements and elements are nested so that parent-child relationships exist between the elements.\nAn example of a hierarchical metadata schema is the IEEE LOM schema, in which metadata elements may belong to a parent metadata element.\nMetadata schemata can also be one-dimensional, or linear, where each element is completely discrete from other elements and classified according to one dimension only.\nAn example of a linear metadata schema is the Dublin Core schema, which is one dimensional.\nMetadata schemata are often two dimensional, or planar, where each element is completely discrete from other elements but classified according to two orthogonal dimensions.\n\nIn all cases where the metadata schemata exceed the planar depiction, some type of hypermapping is required to enable display and view of metadata according to chosen aspect and to serve special views. Hypermapping frequently applies to layering of geographical and geological information overlays.\n\nThe degree to which the data or metadata is structured is referred to as its \"granularity\". \"Granularity\" refers to how much detail is provided. Metadata with a high granularity allows for deeper, more detailed, and more structured information and enables greater level of technical manipulation. A lower level of granularity means that metadata can be created for considerably lower costs but will not provide as detailed information. The major impact of granularity is not only on creation and capture, but moreover on maintenance costs. As soon as the metadata structures become outdated, so too is the access to the referred data. Hence granularity must take into account the effort to create the metadata as well as the effort to maintain it.\n\nInternational standards apply to metadata. Much work is being accomplished in the national and international standards communities, especially ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) to reach consensus on standardizing metadata and registries. The core metadata registry standard is ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registries (MDR), the framework for the standard is described in ISO/IEC 11179-1:2004. A new edition of Part 1 is in its final stage for publication in 2015 or early 2016. It has been revised to align with the current edition of Part 3, ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013 which extends the MDR to support registration of Concept Systems.\n(see ISO/IEC 11179). This standard specifies a schema for recording both the meaning and technical structure of the data for unambiguous usage by humans and computers. ISO/IEC 11179 standard refers to metadata as information objects about data, or \"data about data\". In ISO/IEC 11179 Part-3, the information objects are data about Data Elements, Value Domains, and other reusable semantic and representational information objects that describe the meaning and technical details of a data item. This standard also prescribes the details for a metadata registry, and for registering and administering the information objects within a Metadata Registry. ISO/IEC 11179 Part 3 also has provisions for describing compound structures that are derivations of other data elements, for example through calculations, collections of one or more data elements, or other forms of derived data. While this standard describes itself originally as a \"data element\" registry, its purpose is to support describing and registering metadata content independently of any particular application, lending the descriptions to being discovered and reused by humans or computers in developing new applications, databases, or for analysis of data collected in accordance with the registered metadata content. This standard has become the general basis for other kinds of metadata registries, reusing and extending the registration and administration portion of the standard.\n\nThe Geospatial community has a tradition of specialized geospatial metadata standards, particularly building on traditions of map- and image-libraries and catalogues. Formal metadata is usually essential for geospatial data, as common text-processing approaches are not applicable.\n\nThe Dublin Core metadata terms are a set of vocabulary terms which can be used to describe resources for the purposes of discovery. The original set of 15 classic metadata terms, known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set are endorsed in the following standards documents:\n\nAlthough not a standard, Microformat (also mentioned in the section metadata on the internet below) is a web-based approach to semantic markup which seeks to re-use existing HTML/XHTML tags to convey metadata. Microformat follows XHTML and HTML standards but is not a standard in itself. One advocate of microformats, Tantek Çelik, characterized a problem with alternative approaches: \n\nMetadata may be written into a digital photo file that will identify who owns it, copyright and contact information, what brand or model of camera created the file, along with exposure information (shutter speed, f-stop, etc.) and descriptive information, such as keywords about the photo, making the file or image searchable on a computer and/or the Internet. Some metadata is created by the camera and some is input by the photographer and/or software after downloading to a computer. Most digital cameras write metadata about model number, shutter speed, etc., and some enable you to edit it; this functionality has been available on most Nikon DSLRs since the Nikon D3, on most new Canon cameras since the Canon EOS 7D, and on most Pentax DSLRs since the Pentax K-3. Metadata can be used to make organizing in post-production easier with the use of key-wording. Filters can be used to analyze a specific set of photographs and create selections on criteria like rating or capture time.\n\nPhotographic Metadata Standards are governed by organizations that develop the following standards. They include, but are not limited to:\n\nInformation on the times, origins and destinations of phone calls, electronic messages, instant messages and other modes of telecommunication, as opposed to message content, is another form of metadata. Bulk collection of this call detail record metadata by intelligence agencies has proven controversial after disclosures by Edward Snowden of the fact that certain Intelligence agencies such as the NSA had been (and perhaps still are) keeping online metadata on millions of internet user for up to a year, regardless of whether or not they [ever] were persons of interest to the agency.\n\nMetadata is particularly useful in video, where information about its contents (such as transcripts of conversations and text descriptions of its scenes) is not directly understandable by a computer, but where efficient search of the content is desirable. This is particularly useful in video applications such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition and Vehicle Recognition Identification software, wherein license plate data is saved and used to create reports and alerts. There are two sources in which video metadata is derived: (1) operational gathered metadata, that is information about the content produced, such as the type of equipment, software, date, and location; (2) human-authored metadata, to improve search engine visibility, discoverability, audience engagement, and providing advertising opportunities to video publishers. In today's society most professional video editing software has access to metadata. Avid's MetaSync and Adobe's Bridge are two prime examples of this.\n\nMetadata can be created either by automated information processing or by manual work. Elementary metadata captured by computers can include information about when an object was created, who created it, when it was last updated, file size, and file extension. In this context an \"object\" refers to any of the following:\n\n\nData virtualization has emerged in the 2000s as the new software technology to complete the virtualization \"stack\" in the enterprise. Metadata is used in data virtualization servers which are enterprise infrastructure components, alongside database and application servers. Metadata in these servers is saved as persistent repository and describe business objects in various enterprise systems and applications. Structural metadata commonality is also important to support data virtualization.\n\nStandardization and harmonization work has brought advantages to industry efforts to build metadata systems in the statistical community. Several metadata guidelines and standards such as the European Statistics Code of Practice and ISO 17369:2013 (Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange or SDMX) provide key principles for how businesses, government bodies, and other entities should manage statistical data and metadata. Entities such as Eurostat, European System of Central Banks, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have implemented these and other such standards and guidelines with the goal of improving \"efficiency when managing statistical business processes.\"\n\nMetadata has been used in various ways as a means of cataloging items in libraries in both digital and analog format. Such data helps classify, aggregate, identify, and locate a particular book, DVD, magazine or any object a library might hold in its collection. Until the 1980s, many library catalogues used 3x5 inch cards in file drawers to display a book's title, author, subject matter, and an abbreviated alpha-numeric string (call number) which indicated the physical location of the book within the library's shelves. The Dewey Decimal System employed by libraries for the classification of library materials by subject is an early example of metadata usage. Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, many libraries replaced these paper file cards with computer databases. These computer databases make it much easier and faster for users to do keyword searches. Another form of older metadata collection is the use by US Census Bureau of what is known as the \"Long Form.\" The Long Form asks questions that are used to create demographic data to find patterns of distribution. Libraries employ metadata in library catalogues, most commonly as part of an Integrated Library Management System. Metadata is obtained by cataloguing resources such as books, periodicals, DVDs, web pages or digital images. This data is stored in the integrated library management system, ILMS, using the MARC metadata standard. The purpose is to direct patrons to the physical or electronic location of items or areas they seek as well as to provide a description of the item/s in question.\n\nMore recent and specialized instances of library metadata include the establishment of digital libraries including e-print repositories and digital image libraries. While often based on library principles, the focus on non-librarian use, especially in providing metadata, means they do not follow traditional or common cataloging approaches. Given the custom nature of included materials, metadata fields are often specially created e.g. taxonomic classification fields, location fields, keywords or copyright statement. Standard file information such as file size and format are usually automatically included. Library operation has for decades been a key topic in efforts toward international standardization. Standards for metadata in digital libraries include Dublin Core, METS, MODS, DDI, DOI, URN, schema, EML, and OAI-PMH. Leading libraries in the world give hints on their metadata standards strategies.\n\nMetadata in a museum context is the information that trained cultural documentation specialists, such as archivists, librarians, museum registrars and curators, create to index, structure, describe, identify, or otherwise specify works of art, architecture, cultural objects and their images. Descriptive metadata is most commonly used in museum contexts for object identification and resource recovery purposes.\n\nMetadata is developed and applied within collecting institutions and museums in order to:\n\nMany museums and cultural heritage centers recognize that given the diversity of art works and cultural objects, no single model or standard suffices to describe and catalogue cultural works. For example, a sculpted Indigenous artifact could be classified as an artwork, an archaeological artifact, or an Indigenous heritage item. The early stages of standardization in archiving, description and cataloging within the museum community began in the late 1990s with the development of standards such as Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA), Spectrum, CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) and the CDWA Lite XML schema. These standards use HTML and XML markup languages for machine processing, publication and implementation. The Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR), originally developed for characterizing books, have also been applied to cultural objects, works of art and architecture. Standards, such as the CCO, are integrated within a Museum's Collections Management System (CMS), a database through which museums are able to manage their collections, acquisitions, loans and conservation. Scholars and professionals in the field note that the \"quickly evolving landscape of standards and technologies\" create challenges for cultural documentarians, specifically non-technically trained professionals. Most collecting institutions and museums use a relational database to categorize cultural works and their images. Relational databases and metadata work to document and describe the complex relationships amongst cultural objects and multi-faceted works of art, as well as between objects and places, people and artistic movements. Relational database structures are also beneficial within collecting institutions and museums because they allow for archivists to make a clear distinction between cultural objects and their images; an unclear distinction could lead to confusing and inaccurate searches.\n\nAn object's materiality, function and purpose, as well as the size (e.g., measurements, such as height, width, weight), storage requirements (e.g., climate-controlled environment) and focus of the museum and collection, influence the descriptive depth of the data attributed to the object by cultural documentarians. The established institutional cataloging practices, goals and expertise of cultural documentarians and database structure also influence the information ascribed to cultural objects, and the ways in which cultural objects are categorized. Additionally, museums often employ standardized commercial collection management software that prescribes and limits the ways in which archivists can describe artworks and cultural objects. As well, collecting institutions and museums use Controlled Vocabularies to describe cultural objects and artworks in their collections. Getty Vocabularies and the Library of Congress Controlled Vocabularies are reputable within the museum community and are recommended by CCO standards. Museums are encouraged to use controlled vocabularies that are contextual and relevant to their collections and enhance the functionality of their digital information systems. Controlled Vocabularies are beneficial within databases because they provide a high level of consistency, improving resource retrieval. Metadata structures, including controlled vocabularies, reflect the ontologies of the systems from which they were created. Often the processes through which cultural objects are described and categorized through metadata in museums do not reflect the perspectives of the maker communities.\n\nMetadata has been instrumental in the creation of digital information systems and archives within museums, and has made it easier for museums to publish digital content online. This has enabled audiences who might not have had access to cultural objects due to geographic or economic barriers to have access to them. In the 2000s, as more museums have adopted archival standards and created intricate databases, discussions about Linked Data between museum databases have come up in the museum, archival and library science communities. Collection Management Systems (CMS) and Digital Asset Management tools can be local or shared systems. Digital Humanities scholars note many benefits of interoperability between museum databases and collections, while also acknowledging the difficulties achieving such interoperability.\n\nProblems involving metadata in litigation in the United States are becoming widespread. Courts have looked at various questions involving metadata, including the discoverability of metadata by parties. Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have only specified rules about electronic documents, subsequent case law has elaborated on the requirement of parties to reveal metadata. In October 2009, the Arizona Supreme Court has ruled that metadata records are public record. Document metadata have proven particularly important in legal environments in which litigation has requested metadata, which can include sensitive information detrimental to a certain party in court. Using metadata removal tools to \"clean\" or redact documents can mitigate the risks of unwittingly sending sensitive data. This process partially (see data remanence) protects law firms from potentially damaging leaking of sensitive data through electronic discovery.\n\nOpinion polls have shown that 45% of Americans are \"not at all confident\" in the ability of social media sites ensure their personal data is secure and 40% say that social media sites should not be able to store any information on individuals. 76% of Americans say that they are not confident that the information advertising agencies collect on them is secure and 50% say that online advertising agencies should not be allowed to record any of their information at all.\n\nIn Australia, the need to strengthen national security has resulted in the introduction of a new metadata storage law. This new law means that both security and policing agencies will be allowed to access up to two years of an individual's metadata, with the aim of making it easier to stop any terrorist attacks and serious crimes from happening.\n\nlegislative metadata has been the subject of some discussion in law.gov forums such as workshops held by the Legal Information Institute at the Cornell Law School on March 22 and 23, 2010. The documentation for these forums are titled, \"Suggested metadata practices for legislation and regulations.\" \n\nA handful of key points have been outlined by these discussions, section headings of which are listed as follows:\n\n\nAustralian medical research pioneered the definition of metadata for applications in health care. That approach offers the first recognized attempt to adhere to international standards in medical sciences instead of defining a proprietary standard under the World Health Organization (WHO) umbrella. The medical community yet did not approve the need to follow metadata standards despite research that supported these standards.\n\nResearch studies in the fields of biomedicine and molecular biology frequently yield large quantities of data, including results of genome or meta-genome sequencing, proteomics data, and even notes or plans created during the course of research itself. Each data type involves its own variety of metadata and the processes necessary to produce these metadata. General metadata standards, such as ISA-Tab, allow researchers to create and exchange experimental metadata in consistent formats. Specific experimental approaches frequently have their own metadata standards and systems: metadata standards for mass spectrometry include mzML and SPLASH, while XML-based standard such as PDBML and SRA XML serve as standards for macromolecular structure and sequencing data, respectively.\n\nThe products of biomedical research are generally realized as peer-reviewed manuscripts and these publications are yet another source of data. Metadata for biomedical publications is often created by journal publishers and citation databases such as PubMed and Web of Science. The data contained within manuscripts or accompanying them as supplementary material is less often subject to metadata creation, though they may be submitted to biomedical databases after publication. The original authors and database curators then become responsible for metadata creation, with the assistance of automated processes. Comprehensive metadata for all experimental data is the foundation of the FAIR Guiding Principles, or the standards for ensuring research data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.\n\nA data warehouse (DW) is a repository of an organization's electronically stored data. Data warehouses are designed to manage and store the data. Data warehouses differ from business intelligence (BI) systems, because BI systems are designed to use data to create reports and analyze the information, to provide strategic guidance to management. Metadata is an important tool in how data is stored in data warehouses. The purpose of a data warehouse is to house standardized, structured, consistent, integrated, correct, \"cleaned\" and timely data, extracted from various operational systems in an organization. The extracted data are integrated in the data warehouse environment to provide an enterprise-wide perspective. Data are structured in a way to serve the reporting and analytic requirements. The design of structural metadata commonality using a data modeling method such as entity relationship model diagramming is important in any data warehouse development effort. They detail metadata on each piece of data in the data warehouse. An essential component of a data warehouse/business intelligence system is the metadata and tools to manage and retrieve the metadata. Ralph Kimball describes metadata as the DNA of the data warehouse as metadata defines the elements of the data warehouse and how they work together.\n\nKimball et al. refers to three main categories of metadata: Technical metadata, business metadata and process metadata. Technical metadata is primarily definitional, while business metadata and process metadata is primarily descriptive. The categories sometimes overlap.\n\nThe HTML format used to define web pages allows for the inclusion of a variety of types of metadata, from basic descriptive text, dates and keywords to further advanced metadata schemes such as the Dublin Core, e-GMS, and AGLS standards. Pages can also be geotagged with coordinates. Metadata may be included in the page's header or in a separate file. Microformats allow metadata to be added to on-page data in a way that regular web users do not see, but computers, web crawlers and search engines can readily access. Many search engines are cautious about using metadata in their ranking algorithms due to exploitation of metadata and the practice of search engine optimization, SEO, to improve rankings. See Meta element article for further discussion. This cautious attitude may be justified as people, according to Doctorow, are not executing care and diligence when creating their own metadata and that metadata is part of a competitive environment where the metadata is used to promote the metadata creators own purposes. Studies show that search engines respond to web pages with metadata implementations, and Google has an announcement on its site showing the meta tags that its search engine understands. Enterprise search startup Swiftype recognizes metadata as a relevance signal that webmasters can implement for their website-specific search engine, even releasing their own extension, known as Meta Tags 2.\n\nIn broadcast industry, metadata is linked to audio and video broadcast media to:\n\nThis metadata can be linked to the video media thanks to the video servers. Most major broadcast sport events like FIFA World Cup or the Olympic Games use this metadata to distribute their video content to TV stations through keywords. It is often the host broadcaster who is in charge of organizing metadata through its \"International Broadcast Centre\" and its video servers. This metadata is recorded with the images and are entered by metadata operators (\"loggers\") who associate in live metadata available in \"metadata grids\" through software (such as Multicam(LSM) or IPDirector used during the FIFA World Cup or Olympic Games).\n\nMetadata that describes geographic objects in electronic storage or format (such as datasets, maps, features, or documents with a geospatial component) has a history dating back to at least 1994 (refer MIT Library page on FGDC Metadata). This class of metadata is described more fully on the geospatial metadata article.\n\nEcological and environmental metadata is intended to document the \"who, what, when, where, why, and how\" of data collection for a particular study. This typically means which organization or institution collected the data, what type of data, which date(s) the data was collected, the rationale for the data collection, and the methodology used for the data collection. Metadata should be generated in a format commonly used by the most relevant science community, such as Darwin Core, Ecological Metadata Language, or Dublin Core. Metadata editing tools exist to facilitate metadata generation (e.g. Metavist, , Morpho). Metadata should describe provenance of the data (where they originated, as well as any transformations the data underwent) and how to give credit for (cite) the data products.\n\nWhen first released in 1982, Compact Discs only contained a Table Of Contents (TOC) with the number of tracks on the disc and their length in samples. Fourteen years later in 1996, a revision of the CD Red Book standard added CD-Text to carry additional metadata. But CD-Text was not widely adopted. Shortly thereafter, it became common for personal computers to retrieve metadata from external sources (e.g. CDDB, Gracenote) based on the TOC.\n\nDigital audio formats such as digital audio files superseded music formats such as cassette tapes and CDs in the 2000s. Digital audio files could be labelled with more information than could be contained in just the file name. That descriptive information is called the audio tag or audio metadata in general. Computer programs specializing in adding or modifying this information are called tag editors. Metadata can be used to name, describe, catalogue and indicate ownership or copyright for a digital audio file, and its presence makes it much easier to locate a specific audio file within a group, typically through use of a search engine that accesses the metadata. As different digital audio formats were developed, attempts were made to standardize a specific location within the digital files where this information could be stored.\n\nAs a result, almost all digital audio formats, including mp3, broadcast wav and AIFF files, have similar standardized locations that can be populated with metadata. The metadata for compressed and uncompressed digital music is often encoded in the ID3 tag. Common editors such as TagLib support MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MPC, Speex, WavPack TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4, and ASF file formats.\n\nWith the availability of cloud applications, which include those to add metadata to content, metadata is increasingly available over the Internet.\n\nMetadata can be stored either \"internally\", in the same file or structure as the data (this is also called \"embedded metadata\"), or \"externally\", in a separate file or field from the described data. A data repository typically stores the metadata \"detached\" from the data, but can be designed to support embedded metadata approaches. Each option has advantages and disadvantages:\n\nMetadata can be stored in either human-readable or binary form. Storing metadata in a human-readable format such as XML can be useful because users can understand and edit it without specialized tools. However, text-based formats are rarely optimized for storage capacity, communication time, or processing speed. A binary metadata format enables efficiency in all these respects, but requires special software to convert the binary information into human-readable content.\n\nEach relational database system has its own mechanisms for storing metadata. Examples of relational-database metadata include:\nIn database terminology, this set of metadata is referred to as the catalog. The SQL standard specifies a uniform means to access the catalog, called the information schema, but not all databases implement it, even if they implement other aspects of the SQL standard. For an example of database-specific metadata access methods, see Oracle metadata. Programmatic access to metadata is possible using APIs such as JDBC, or SchemaCrawler.\n\nOne of the first satirical examinations of the concept of Metadata as we understand it today is American Science Fiction author Hal Draper's short story, MS_Fnd_in_a_Lbry (1961).\nHere, the knowledge of all Mankind is condensed into an object the size of a desk drawer, however the magnitude of the metadata (e.g. catalog of catalogs of... , as well as indexes and histories) eventually leads to dire yet humorous consequence for the human race.\nThe story prefigures the modern consequences of allowing metadata to become more important than the real data it is concerned with, and the risks inherent in that eventuality as a cautionary tale.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1123386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1123386", "title": "Political consulting", "text": "Political consulting\n\nPolitical consulting is a form of consulting that consists primarily of advising and assisting political campaigns. Although the most important role of political consultants is arguably the development and production of mass media (largely television and direct mail), consultants advise campaigns on many other activities, ranging from opposition research and voter polling, to field strategy and get out the vote efforts.\n\nPresident William McKinley's closest political adviser Mark Hanna is sometimes described as the first political consultant.\n\nWhitaker and Baxter established the first true political consulting firm, Campaigns, Inc., which focused exclusively on political campaigns in California in the 1930s - 1950s. However, political consulting blossomed with the increasing use of television advertising for campaign communications in the 1960s.\n\nJoseph Napolitan was the first person to describe himself as a political consultant; The New York Times newspaper described him in a 1968 profile as \"that newest American phenomenon, the professional campaign manager\" and \"a \"pioneering campaign consultant\"\".\n\nIn recent years, political consulting has become more commonplace throughout the world and has extended its reach to campaigns at all levels of government. Many consultants work not only for campaigns, but also for parties and political action committees, while some focus on public relations and research work.\n\nPolitical consultants sometimes act as political strategists, a senior political consultant who promote the election of certain candidates or the interests of certain groups. This is achieved by planning campaign strategies, coordinating campaign staffers, and arranging events to publicize candidates or causes.\n\nPolitical consultants act as public relations specialists, salespeople and managers. By using many forms of marketing-suitable media, including advertising and press releases, the general goal of political consultants is to make voters aware of their candidates' party platform.\n\nAs political consulting has expanded worldwide, journalists have noted the influence of political consulting on candidates, voters, presidents and governments of different nations. Well-known American political consultants such as James Carville, Joseph Napolitan and David H. Sayers, have traveled to other continents, acting as consultants on several political campaigns and advising heads of state. For example, Napolitan acted as a consultant of French President Válery Giscard d’Estaing, several Venezuelan presidents, and Costa Rica’s Óscar Arias Sánchez, and Dick Morris \"has consulted for candidates in other countries of the western hemisphere, including the campaigns of Fernando de la Rua for President of Argentina, Jorge Batlle for President of Uruguay, Vicente Fox for President of Mexico, and Raphael Trotman for President of Guyana.\" Many Latin American political consultants have also led political campaigns outside of their native countries. One such example is Brazilian political consultant , who simultaneously led three winning presidential campaigns in Latin America: Danilo Medina, in the Dominican Republic; Hugo Chávez, in Venezuela; and José Eduardo dos Santos, in Angola, in the African continent. Venezuelan political strategist JJ Rendon (who lives in United States), has also been recognized internationally, having been ranked as one of the top five most prominent Latin American consultants by the U.S.-based publication \"Campaigns & Elections\" (Latin American edition) and who was the 2014 winner of The Victory Awards for his work as the lead strategist of successful presidential campaigns of Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia (including his reelection campaign in 2014), Porfirio Lobo and Juan Orlando Hernández in Honduras and Enrique Peña Nieto in Mexico, among others. has been described by the news magazine Veja as \"capable of mapping out the weaknesses of adversaries with an acupuncturist’s precision.\" While Rendon, has been described by Miami New Times as the \"Latin America's Karl Rove\".\n\nAs political consulting has become more prevalent, consultants have become subject to increasing scrutiny and involvement in spotlight scandals as journalists have devoted considerable attention to their activities. Some successful political consultants, such as James Carville and Newt Gingrich, capitalize on their consulting fame to become professional pundits. Such political consultants routinely appear on television news programs, write books and are treated as social media celebrities.\n\nSome detractors accuse political consultants of putting their own interests and images ahead of their clients. Some consultants allege that too many consultants put their own financial interests ahead of the campaigns they are hired to serve, take on too many clients, or focus too much energy on building their own reputations.\n\nReview for weasel words, if none found, delete this template.\nCritics of the political consulting industry blame consultants for what they see as problems in the American election system.\n\n\nSocial media has dramatically changed the way in which modern political campaigns are run. With younger and more tech-savvy citizens entering into the voting population, social media are the platforms on which the politicians need to establish themselves and engage with the public. In years to come, social media is anticipated to overtake traditional media in terms of importance to political campaigns. \n\nFor example, in Australia 86% of Australians access the Internet, and with a 17,048,864 voting age population (according to IDEA), around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use social media, which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year).\n\nThe American Association of Political Consultants is the major trade association for political consultants in the United States, with thousands of members. Like similar professional organizations, it propagates a code of ethics and gives out awards.\n\nThe political consulting industry's trade publication is \"Campaigns & Elections\".\n\n\n\n"}

He is the father of Crown Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, Alexandra Miller, and Pia Getty, dubbed by tabloids and high society as The Miller Sisters.\n\nMiller was born in Quincy, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, in 1933, the son of Ellis Warren Appleton Miller (1898 – c. 1986), a bookkeeper, salesperson, and descendant of several Mayflower passengers; and Sophia \"Sophie\" June Squarebriggs (1899–1998), a Canadian-born former governess. Miller's ancestry is rooted in the British North American colonial elite, and descends over time, he claims, from Henry I of England, Louis IV the Carolingian, and William, King of the Scots.\n\nMiller attended Cornell University School of Hotel Administration and graduated in 1955, with a Bachelor of Science in Hotel Administration. He was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity and the Irving Literary Society.\n\nThe concept of \"duty-free shopping\" – offering high-end concessions to travelers, free of import taxes – was in its infancy when, with Chuck Feeney, Miller founded DFS on November 7, 1960.\n\nDFS began operations in Hong Kong, where it still maintains its corporate headquarters, later expanding to Europe and other continents. DFS' first major breakthrough came in the early 1960s, when it secured the exclusive concession for duty-free sales in Hawaii and Hong Kong, allowing it to market its products to Japanese travelers. DFS eventually expanded to off-airport duty-free stores and large downtown Galleria stores, and became the world's largest travel retailer. In 1996, Feeney's interests were acquired by Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), the French luxury goods group, for $1.63 billion.\n\nMiller kept his shares and remains a significant minority shareholder (38%) in DFS alongside LVMH, which bought out Feeney's share. More recently, Miller targeted the emergence of mainland China's economic elite. To present its new merchandise, DFS has moved beyond the airport liquor store venue and into store environments, seeking to market the broadest portfolio of brand names in the travelling marketplace.\nIn 2010, the DFS Group had an estimated sales of about €2.2 billion. As of 2012, it has 150 stores in 15 Pacific states. Its downtown activities operate under the Galleriera name.\n\nMiller was named the November 2010 Personality of the Month by The Moodie Report in recognition of his advancement of the luxury goods industry's cause. That year, Duty Free Shops (DFS) celebrated its 50th anniversary at the DFS Galleria Sun Plaza store in Hong Kong, with a gala attended by 2000 guests, and featuring a performance by Wyclef Jean.\n\nIn 1973, Miller founded Search Investment Group Ltd, an international investment company of which he is CEO and chairperson. The Search investment Group Ltd is a large shareholder in Ortelius Capital Partners, which is an investment firm founded by Miller's son-in-law HRH Prince Pavlos of Greece and Mr. Peter DeSorcy. He is also principal of SAIL advisors (Search Alternative Investments Ltd), global investors in hedge funds. Along with other assets, Miller is currently ranked the 68th wealthiest person in the UK, down from 22nd in 2003.\n\nIn October 2003, Miller's monohull yacht, the Mari-Cha IV, set a new world record, becoming the first monohull ever to cross the Atlantic Ocean in under seven days. During the same crossing, the yacht also broke the 24-hour distance record, by sailing . Both he and his son-in-law Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece, son of King Constantine II of Greece were crew members.\n\nOn April 30, 2005, the Mari-Cha IV won the Rolex Transatlantic Challenge and broke the century-old record for a west-to-east transatlantic crossing established by Charlie Barr. It completed the 2,925-nautical mile passage across the North Atlantic between New York and England in a time of 9 days, 15 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds—a full 2 days, 12 hours, 6 minutes and 56 seconds faster than the record set 100 years earlier. During the record-breaking crossing, Miller pushed the Mari-Cha III beyond its limits in poor weather, and the mainsail headboard and the headboard cars on both mainsail and mizzen broke.\n\nMiller is married to Ecuadorian-born María Clara \"Chantal\" Pesantes Becerra, they have three daughters: Pia (b. 1966), Marie-Chantal (b. 1968), and Alexandra (b. 1972)\n\nHe also owns the Gunnerside Estate in Yorkshire, one of the largest sporting country estates in Britain.\n\nMiller is a trustee of the Asia Society, the Independent non-executive director and Member of the Remuneration Committee of Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd., and presidential councilor and trustee emeritus of Cornell University.\n"}

{"id": "16395607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16395607", "title": "Samuel Beníquez", "text": "Samuel Beníquez\n\nSamuel Beníquez Méndez was born on October 28, 1971, at Doctors' Center Hospital in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico. His biological mother is Antonia Beníquez Seguí. He was adopted by his maternal uncle and aunt, Félix Beníquez Quiñones and Ada Méndez Castro, on February 21, 1973.\n\nHowever, Samuel Beníquez’s biological mother, Antonia Beníquez Seguí, remained in the Beníquez–Méndez family home, taking care of her son as if she were his nanny. Beníquez Méndez grew up believing this lie and was indoctrinated in the Congregación Mita religion, which was founded in Puerto Rico and is now established in several parts of the world.\n\nBeníquez Méndez has studied music since age six and excels on instruments such as the clarinet, flute, and saxophone. He was a member of Mita Congregation’s wind band until 1995 and received a scholarship to study music at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras campus.\n\nAbout thirty years later, on May 13, 2003, Beníquez Méndez and his mother, Beníquez Seguí, filed a motion before the Court of First Instance to nullify the adoption. They largely argued that Beníquez Seguí was coerced and intimidated by the Beníquez–Méndez couple to consent to the adoption of her son. Consequently, they alleged that her consent was unlawful, which rendered the resolution issued February 21, 1973, null and void. Unlawful consent deprives the Court of jurisdiction, making the resolution issued nonexistent.\n\nThe petitioners also argued that Beníquez Méndez was raised by his mother from birth and even moved with her at the age of six to live at a residence other than that of his aunt and uncle. Furthermore, they added that the Beníquez–Méndez couple only sought to adopt the minor in order to financially profit off a child they supposedly never raised.\n\nOn September 13, 2003, the Court of First Instance overruled the petitioners’ motion with an unsubstantiated resolution. This decision was never appealed or revised, becoming final and enforceable.\n\nLater, on November 4, 2004, Beníquez Seguí and Beníquez Méndez filed a second claim regarding nullity of adoption procedures and declaration of filiation in which the petitioners alleged that Beníquez Seguí, when she was still pregnant with Beníquez Méndez, was coerced, threatened, and subjected to “mental, moral, emotional, and religious pressures” to give her consent for the Beníquez-Méndez couple to adopt her son.\n\nSeparately from what they alleged in their first motion, the petitioners also argued that the pattern of coercion and intimidation in question was because Mr. Teófilo Vargas Seín, spiritual leader of the Mita Congregation religion, was the biological father of Beníquez Méndez and that the aunt and uncle – together with other people from the congregation – orchestrated the adoption in question in order to hide that fact. In agreement with the above, they requested that the adoption under examination be ruled null and that the Demographic Registrar be ordered to register Beníquez Méndez as the biological son of Beníquez Seguí and Vargas Seín.\n\nThe legal case spent nearly 10 years in court and even reached the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, concluding in a resolution by the Supreme Court ordering that the proceedings of the case be continued and that Teófilo Vargas Seín, better known as Aarón, forcibly recognize the filiation, thus granting Samuel Beníquez Méndez the right to know his true paternal filiation.\n\nAs such, Aarón was officially summoned to appear at the Histocompatibility Institute of the Medical Sciences Campus of the University of Puerto Rico on March 11, 2013, at 8:00 a.m. to take a DNA test together with Samuel Beníquez Méndez and Antonia Beníquez Seguí.\n\nThe parties, including Samuel Beníquez Méndez, his vilified mother, Antonia Beníquez Seguí, and the lawyer who had brought the paternity suit for 10 years, Nicolás Nogueras, were summoned to the Court of San Juan to hear the reading of the DNA test on March 25, 2013, by Judge Arlene Sellés Guerrini.\n\nThe laboratory results reflected a 99.9999 percent chance that Aarón is Samuel Beníquez Méndez’s biological father. Beníquez Méndez, at the age of 41 years, celebrated that he had a father, named Aarón, and that his mother was vindicated.\n\nHowever, Teófilo Vargas Seín, the top leader of the Mita Congregation, “left” the case and to this day, has never wanted to establish a relationship of friendship, love, spirituality, or fatherhood with his biological son, Samuel.\n\nSamuel Beníquez Méndez, CEO of AVFA, got his start by working at a computer center at a very young age. Beníquez Méndez was 16 years old and still in high school when he began working as a data processor at the Government of Puerto Rico’s General Services Administration’s Computer Center, the only teenager hired at that time and on a night shift. At age 18, following the example set by his father, he began working at the Hermanos Unidos Savings and Credit Cooperative in Hato Rey, San Jose, Puerto Rico.\n\nHe held a number of positions in that line of work within the organization until he decided to work independently as an insurance and investment agent with the company Primerica Financial Services (formerly part of Citigroup), becoming a regional vice president while he attended the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, where he received his Bachelor’s in Business Administration with a Concentration in Marketing. Meanwhile, he learned a lot about insurance and investments surrounded by qualified people with extensive knowledge in the field.\n\nBeníquez Méndez had always intended to build a career and after succeeding, start his own company. He therefore founded the financial institution First Home Financial with his brother Samuel Ortiz in 1995, which has locations in several towns in Puerto Rico and the US state of Pennsylvania. He held the position of CEO of the bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the corporation. Following this, he was the CEO of successful companies such as ER Remodeling & Construction Co., Imperial Music Studio, Imperial College, Black Dot Records, BD Authors, Imperial Recording Studios, and Imperial Artists, among others, while he continued his studies at SMC University. As CEO of these companies, in addition to administration, he was also directly involved in marketing and media relations.\n\nHis exciting career in the corporate world since he was young has provided him with important experiences in administration, marketing, communications, and the responsibility of being in charge of the losses and earnings of different companies.\n\nToday, Beníquez Méndez is the CEO of AVFA Firm LLC, a leading company in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and the continental United States. The company offers public relations services, strategic communications, copywriting, media services, interactive services, and business advice to all types of companies.\n\nSince taking the reins of the company, Beníquez Méndez has worked to expand and position it for success in the 21st century, focusing on growth and new business areas. Its portfolio focuses on protecting the company from taking too many risks while maximizing its opportunities for growth.\n\nJust like how he learned when he was young, Beníquez Méndez has surrounded himself with talented and knowledgeable people. Additionally, he has simplified the organization and promotes a team approach to solving problems and determining a long-term strategic direction. Beníquez Méndez has also given employees a system of policies and values and encouraged them to live the company’s mission and vision, where professionalism and excellent service are the most important.\n\nBeníquez Méndez is the cowriter and composer (with Samuel Ortiz) of songs such as \"Histeria,\" \"Dame de ti,\" \"Inevitable,\" \"Todo fue por,\" and \"Si a ti te gusta,\" as well as another 24 sets of lyrics and musical pieces. Also in collaboration with Samuel Ortiz, he produced the albums Histeriha and Off Da’ Hook, winning the Paoli Award for Best New Artist in 2002. In 2005, the songs off his album Off Da' Hook were again distributed on the world market under the label Critique, this time on the album Viper Boyz, sharing credits with artists as big as Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, D-Roc, DJ Smurf, Kaine, Los TNT, and Ludacris.\n\nTheir achievements led to them becoming voting members of the Recording Academy and the Latin Recording Academy, and in 2012, he received a recognition reading “In acknowledgment and recognition of 10 years of membership, and for supporting the Recording Academy’s mission of improving the climate for music and the lives of all the members of our creative community.” The recognition was signed by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, George Flanigen IV, and the president/CEO, Neil Portnow.\n\nAdditionally, under the pseudonym Miguel Amadeus, he wrote the bestselling book Tu alto precio ... Mi gran valor in 2004, and in 2015, he wrote and published his most recent book, El niño versus la bestia, which was displayed on the big screens in Times Square in New York.\n\nMarch 7, 2011: For the great leadership of Samuel Beníquez, he and his firm AVFA on March 7, 2011 in Geneva, won the award for business excellence “CENTURY INTERNATIONAL QUALITY ERA AWARD”, “GOLD CATEGORY”, awarded by the corporate congress that BID (Business Initiative Directions) held annually.\n\nOn June 25, 2011: Samuel Beníquez and his firm received the award for business excellence “THE BIZZ 2011″, the recognition of “Inspirational Company” and the honorary title of “World Business Leader”.

There are two ways of getting fish and other sea life, either by buying them off sellers or by catching them yourself. Dolphin shows can also be created and serve as the star attraction of the aquarium. Staff must be hired to maintain the aquarium and also to take proper care and attention to the animals.\n\nIn a 1999 interview, Bullfrog Productions co-founder Les Edgar stated that \"Theme Aquarium\" was produced and tested in the United Kingdom, but implemented in Japan. His intention was to \"cross barriers\" between the United Kingdom and Japan, and produce a game suitable for both markets, as, due to the success of \"Theme Park\" and \"Populous\" in Japan, he thought Bullfrog were more successful than other companies in producing games that were successful there. He commented that it sold well in Japan, but would not in the United Kingdom, and that the idea of having the producers in the United Kingdom and the development team in Japan worked. In 2012, Bullfrog programmer Jonty Barnes asked fourteen ex-colleagues about the game, none of whom were familiar with it, with one describing it as \"one of those obscure titles\", although he also stated that it was known that it was intended for a Japan-only release on the PlayStation.\n\nThe game was originally intended to only be released in Japan, however Electronic Arts later developed an English version of the game.
