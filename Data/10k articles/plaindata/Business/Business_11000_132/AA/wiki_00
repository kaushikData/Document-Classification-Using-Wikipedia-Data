However Basell, and then later LyondellBasell, had its origin in a joint venture between BASF and Royal Dutch Shell.

In 2007, driven on by its then owners Access Industries and against the advice of Basell senior management, Basell acquired the privately owned US company Lyondell Chemical Company to form LyondellBasell, paying far above the market rate for the shares. The main winner was Access, who also held significant shares in Lyondell and was able to realise a massive profit by forcing Basell to overpay.

Bid managers orchestrate the creation of the solution and proposal as ‘Bid Project Managers’ ensuring compliance with customer requirements while highlighting company value proposition. The role of a bid manager often works with company board directors and C-level management (i.e. CEO, CFO) to bring and deliver strategic approaches to win bids.\n\nBid managers are responsible for the proposal of bids to existing or prospective clients for projects. A bid manager will ensure the smooth running of the bid for a project within the correct time and financial parameters, and manage the relationship with the client. Bid managers may work in conjunction with a bid director and often with specialists in the construction and built environment industries to create and manage the bid for a project.\n\nA bid manager's role varies based on the industry and how the individual company has structured their management of sales cycle. A company that depends on short (quick win) sales cycle often relies on proposal managers, where as organisations that depends on longer term, complex sales processes depends on bid managers. In addition to managing bids, bid managers work closely with company board directors and C-level management to set the strategic direction of the business by providing insight into market trends through direct exposure to critical feedback from failed bids and the evolving needs of clients.\n\nBid managers' salaries differ across the construction industry depending on the company and, moreover, the specific project. According to a survey conducted in 2010 the average salary of a bid manager in the UK construction industry, including a bonus, is £120,250 per annum. Certain projects are more financially beneficial depending on the nature of the project or sector. For example, bid managers working on private projects earn an average salary of £80,000, whilst public sector projects make a lower figure of £40,000. However, bonuses can be accumulated at a rate of at least 20%-60% of the salary. For example, a salary of £50,000 can be given and depending on performance, a 60% bonus will be given on top of the salary, bringing the total earnings to £70,000 or more.\n\nBid managers play an important role in outsourcing, where they produce and manage bids for companies structured to take on outsourcing projects from the government and industries. These bids run anywhere between three and 18 months (on average about six months), involve substantial bid budgets (as much as $5 million for very large bids over $100 million in value) and large teams of between 10 and 100 people. The bid manager ensures that all customer-specified milestones are met and all deliverables of the bid are produced as specified. A bid manager's performance is normally evaluated based on the percentage of contracts he or she wins. Bid managers typically work with teams collected together from line functions for the temporary duration of the bid project, and hence need to have strong leadership skills to manage bids successfully. Good bid managers are in strong demand in the outsourcing industry.\n"}

Zabeth is attacked and turned into a vampire.\n\nEvan convinces Andrew to work late with him. Andrew goes to the basement and is attacked by Zabeth. Meanwhile, Evan searches Max’s office, finding photos of Amanda and personnel files where each employee photograph is marked with an x, circle, or check.\n\nAndrew returns upstairs and seemingly drops dead in front of Evan.

Frank reveals that he was with Tim when they witnessed the ongoing vampire activity. The three men go to Frank’s car for weapons and discover that Frank’s vehicle was robbed.

{"id": "2320741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320741", "title": "Diplomatic correspondence", "text": "Diplomatic correspondence\n\nDiplomatic correspondence is correspondence between one state and another, usually – though not exclusively – of a formal character. It follows several widely observed customs and style in composition, substance, presentation, and delivery and can generally be categorized into letters and notes.\n\nLetters are correspondence between heads of state, typically used for the appointment and recall of ambassadors; for the announcement of the death of a sovereign or an accession to the throne; or for expressions of congratulations or condolence. \n\nLetters between two monarchs of equal rank will typically begin with the salutation \"Sir My Brother\" (or \"Madame My Sister\", in the case of a female monarch) and close with the valediction \"Your Good Brother\" (or Sister, in the case of a female monarch). In the case where one monarch is of inferior rank to the other (for instance, if the Grand Duke of Luxembourg were to correspond to the Queen of the United Kingdom), the inferior monarch will use the salutation \"Sire\" (or \"Madame\"), while the superior monarch may refer to the other as \"Cousin\" instead of \"Brother\". If either the sender or the recipient is the head-of-state of a republic, letters may begin with the salutation \"My Great and Good Friend\" and close with the valediction \"Your Good Friend\"; beneath the signature line will be inscribed \"To Our Great and Good Friend [Name and Title of Recipient]\".\n\nA letter of credence (\"lettres de créance\") is the instrument by which a head of state appoints (\"accredits\") ambassadors to foreign countries. Also known as credentials, the letter closes with a phrase \"asking that credit may be given to all that the ambassador may say in the name of his sovereign or Government.\" The credentials are presented personally to the receiving country's head of state or viceroy in a formal ceremony. Letters of credence are worded carefully, as the sending or acceptance of a letter implies diplomatic recognition of the other government. Letters of credence date to the thirteenth century.\n\nA letter of recall is formal correspondence from one head-of-state notifying a second head-of-state that he or she is recalling his state's ambassador.\n\nIn cases where an envoy is entrusted with unusually extensive tasks that would not be covered by an ordinary permanent legation (such as the negotiation of a special treaty or convention, or representation at a diplomatic congress), an envoy may be given full powers (\"pleins pouvoirs\") \"in letters patent signed by the head of the State\" designing \"either limited or unlimited full powers, according to the requirements of the case.\"\n\nAccording to \"Satow's Diplomatic Practice\", the bestowal of full powers traces its history to the Roman \"plena potestas\"; its purpose was to be able to dispense, as far as possible, with the long delays needed in earlier times for referring problems back to higher authority. Their use at the present day is a formal recognition of the necessity of absolute confidence in the authority and standing of the negotiator.\n\nA \"note verbale\" is the most formal form of note and is so-named as it originally represented a formal record of information delivered orally. Notes verbale are written in the third person and printed on official letterhead; they are typically sealed with an embosser or, in some cases, a stamp. All notes verbale begin with a formal salutation, typically:\n\nNotes verbales will also close with a formal valediction, typically:\n\nNotes verbales composed by the British Foreign Office are written on blue paper.\n\nA collective note is a letter delivered from multiple states to a single recipient state. It is always written in the third person. The collective note has been a rarely used form of diplomatic communication due to the difficulty in obtaining agreements among multiple states to the exact wording of a letter.\n\nAn identic note is a letter delivered from a single state to multiple recipient states. Examples include the identic note sent by Thomas Jefferson regarding action against the Barbary Pirates and that from the United States to China and the Soviet Union in 1929. In it, the United States called on the other two powers to resolve their differences over the Eastern China Railway peacefully.\n\nA \"bout de papier\" (speaking note) may be presented by a visiting official when meeting with an official from another state at the conclusion of the meeting. Prepared in advance, it contains a short summary of the main points addressed by the visiting official during the meeting and, firstly, serves as a memory aid for the visiting official when speaking. It, secondly, removes ambiguity about the subject of the meeting occasioned by verbal miscues by the visiting official. Bouts de papier are always presented without credit or attribution so as to preserve the confidentiality of the meeting in case the document is later disclosed.\n\nA \"démarche\" (non-paper) is considered less formal than the already informal bout de papier. Officially described as \"a request or intercession with a foreign official\" it is a written request that is presented without attribution from the composing state and is, therefore, delivered in-person.\n\nSimilar to a démarche, an \"aide-mémoire\" is a proposed agreement or negotiating text circulated informally among multiple states for discussion without committing the originating delegation's country to the contents. It has no identified source, title, or attribution and no standing in the relationship involved.\n\nStandard diplomatic protocol varies from country to country, but generally requires clear yet concise translation between both parties.\n\nThe earliest forms of diplomatic correspondence were, out of necessity, written in Latin, Latin being a common language among states of a linguistically diverse Europe. By the early 1800s French had firmly supplanted Latin as the language of diplomacy; on one occasion, in 1817, the British attempted to correspond with the Austrian Imperial Court in English, prompting Klemens von Metternich to threaten retaliatory correspondence in German. In modern times, French has largely been replaced by English as a diplomatic lingua franca in correspondence between two states that do not share a common tongue.\n\nStates may sometimes reject diplomatic correspondence addressed to them by returning the original copy to the sending state. This is done as a rebuff of the contents of the correspondence and is typically reserved for cases where the receiving state feels the language used by the sending state is rude, or the subject matter represents an inappropriate intercession into the receiving state's internal affairs.\n\n"}

She was also an active member of the Cook Islands Voyaging Society. In 1995, Reid served as the only female crew member on board the Te Au O Tonga, which sailed to Raiatea, Tahiti, Nuku Hiva and Hawaii during a three and a half month voyage. In 2002, she completed a second sailing voyage aboard the \"Te Moana Nui O Kiva\" from her home in Rarotonga to Tahiti, Huahine, Raiatea, Tahaa, Bora Bora and Mitiaro.\n\nAdditionally, Reid was a member five separate Cook Islands environmental agencies and served as a judge for the country. She is credited with the reintroduction of the raui system to the Cook Islands, a traditional system forbidding access to or use of a resource, such as to a fishing lagoon or shellfish, for a certain period of time. The system is traditionally used to preserve scarce food resources and also encourages the protection of the environment.\n\nIn April 2011, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tom Marsters announced Reid's appointment as High Commissioner of the Cook Islands to New Zealand, based in Wellington. She was to take office in July 2011, succeeding Mike Mitchell.\n\nDorice Reid collapsed while attending a tourism conference in Auckland, and died at Auckland Hospital at 1 AM on 16 June 2011, aged 67. A resident of Kauare, Rarotonga, she was survived by two nieces and a nephew.\n\n"}

Within a few years, membership grew to include chapters in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.\nIn 1996, YEO helped create the World Entrepreneurs’ Organization (WEO), which served as an alumni organization for YEO members who, after the age of 40, wanted to continue their involvement in an entrepreneurial membership organization. In 2005, YEO and WEO merged to form the Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) as it is known today.\n\nVerne Harnish is the founder of the Young Entrepreneurs’ Organization and recruited 22 entrepreneurs as founding board members to initially fund the start-up of the organization. Kevin Harrigton, of Shark Tank fame, was one of the founding board members.\n\nThe Entrepreneurs' Organization runs two additional programs: the EO Global Student Entrepreneur Awards and the EO Accelerator Program.\n\nThe EO Global Student Entrepreneur Awards (GSEA) is an awards program for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who own and operate a business. EO GSEA operates as an international series of competitions for student entrepreneurs who are attending a recognized high school, college or university, who own a for-profit business, are principally responsible for its operation and have been generating revenue for a minimum of six consecutive months.\n\nThe Global Entrepreneur Indicator (GEI) began in 2010 as a semi-annual survey of the membership of the Entrepreneurs’ Organization. The Global Entrepreneur Indicator surveys a globally representative sample of entrepreneurs to predict economic trends in a number of areas, including job creation, profits and debt loads, economic forecasting, and the business environment. \nIn 2012, the GEI found that approximately 60% of businesses experienced a net profit, while 59% increased their employee headcount.\n"}

His ancestor had migrated to Norway from Hannover in the second half of the eighteenth century. In February 1854 he married Ingeborg Wallem (1830–1902), a sister of Fredrik Meltzer Wallem.\n\nGade began working in his father's manufacture business \"F. G. Gade\" around the age of Confirmation, and took over the company in 1849. As he did not acquire burghership until 1853, the company was run by his first cousin Herman Baars in the first phase. The company eventually went well, and in 1877 Gade retired from business, buying the farm Øvre Fantoft in Fana. He developed the surrounding area, and even bought a stave church which stood at Fortun in Sogn og Fjordane, had it moved and re-erected it as Fantoft stave church. This church burned down in 1993 under gloomy circumstances. Gade also took much of the initiative to found the Nesttun–Os Railway, and was an important shareholder.\n\nFrom 1880 to 1896 Gade was the American consul for all of Western Norway, including the coast up to Vardø in the north. He also served on Bergen city council from 1880 to 1895, being a member of the movement which would become the Liberal Party. He successfully stood for election in 1882, and served one term in the Parliament of Norway, from 1883 to 1885. When Johan Sverdrup became Prime Minister in 1884, Gade was a candidate for a government minister position, but declined the offer. He wanted to back out of national politics, and only served as a deputy representative during the term 1886–1888.\n\nGade also founded two insurance companies, Vesta in 1880 and Hygea in 1884 (often branded as the same company, \"Vesta-Hygea\"), and was a board member of both companies until his death.

He is a member of the Colorado Party.\n\nCartes owns about two dozen businesses in his Grupo Cartes conglomerate including tobacco, soft drinks, meat production, and banking. He was president of Club Libertad football club from 2001 until 2012, and had been the president of the national team department of the Paraguayan Football Association during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\nCartes' father was the owner of a Cessna aircraft franchise holding company and the young Horacio studied aviation mechanics in the United States. At the age of 19, he started a currency exchange business which grew into the Banco Amambay. Over the following years, Cartes bought or helped establish 25 companies including Tabesa, the country's biggest cigarette manufacturer, and a major fruit juice bottling company.\n\nIn 1986, Cartes spent 60 days in jail during a currency fraud investigation. He was accused of making millions of dollars on a central bank loan obtained at a preferential exchange rate and then moving it through his money exchange business before buying farm equipment in the U.S. The case was eventually dropped.\n\nCartes was imprisoned on charges of currency fraud for seven months in 1989. He was eventually cleared by a court.\n\nIn 2000, the anti-drug police seized a plane carrying cocaine and marijuana on his ranch. He claimed that the plane had made an emergency landing, that he had no involvement with the drug trade and that he opposed the legalization of narcotics.\n\nCartes' name appears in the Offshore leaks files in connection with a Cook Islands financial entity linked to Cartes' Paraguayan bank Banco Amambay. A classified WikiLeaks cable from 2010 mentioned Cartes as the focus of a money laundering investigation by the DEA.\n\nUntil 2008 Cartes was uninvolved in politics and he was not registered as a voter. He joined the center-right Colorado Party in 2009 and said he wanted to counter the swing to the left in Latin American politics. He became known as an efficient politician uncompromised by his party's past support of the military dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner who ruled until 1989.\n\nIn regards to allegation of his connections to the drug trade, as well as being targeted by the DEA, he said during his presidential campaign: \"I wouldn't want to be president if I had ties to drug traffickers. Go to the courts and check. There's nothing, not a single charge against me.\"\n\nCartes was the Colorado candidate in the 2013 presidential election. The BBC suggested that his convincing points during his campaign were the promises to raise private capital to upgrade the country's infrastructure, to modernise its public enterprises, to attract international investments, and to create jobs. On 21 April 2013, he was elected President of Paraguay with 45.80% of the vote. When he took office on 15 August, it marked only the second time in the country's 202 years of independence that a ruling party peacefully surrendered power to the opposition.\n\nIn regards to the impeachment of Fernando Lugo and the hostile reception the country was given in the aftermath by Latin American leaders, Cartes said that the country should not withdraw from Mercosur due to its economic benefits of free trade: \"Paraguay in no way should abandon Mercosur...we have to hold on tight while they bash us a little bit and keep low and don’t play to being giants or annoyed. Mercosur is a common market like is Europe and with our neighbours we also have many coincidences. [In a globalised world] all countries are interconnected and it is out of the questions trying to isolate Paraguay from other countries. The OAS has already began to understand our politics, that we’re a sovereign country, all was done according to the book and the Constitution.\" Upon being sworn in he said: \"I'm not in politics to make a career of it or become wealthier. I'm in politics to serve my people, make the future better for new generations and build up our identity as a free, independent and sovereign people.\" His inauguration was attended by fellow conservative South American, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera who said: \"I want to say to President Horacio Cartes that we are very expectant about his future achievements. The slogan of his campaign was 'new directions,' and every country needs new directions and to be confronted with new challenges...the challenge of integration in our Latin America is still a pending challenge and the experience of the Pacific Alliance was a great experience which has been very fruitful.\" Other leaders at his inauguration were Argentina's Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Peru's Ollanta Humala, Brazil's Dilma Rousseff, Uruguay's José Mujica and Taiwan's Ma Ying-jeou.\n\nCartes said of his cabinet that the future ministers have the \"enormous responsibility\" of honouring those who voted for them and gave them a governing mandate. \"It will be the beginning of a story that us Paraguayans want, a government for all, an inclusive government, our great obligation is with the citizens...we need all the Paraguayans to help us, to orientate us.\" The majority of them have an overwhelmingly technical profile:\nOn May 21, 2018, the Paraguayan embassy moved to Jerusalem, becoming the third country in the world to recognize the city as the diplomatic capital of Israel. However, Cartes's successor Mario Abdo Benítez reversed the decision on September 5, 2018.\n\nOn 22 April 2018, Cartes was elected to a full Senate seat, which he ran for in hopes of extending his political influence past his presidency. New Senators would be sworn in on 30 June 2018, six weeks before Cartes's presidential term was scheduled to end, thus the need for Cartes to leave office before the expiration of his term, as the constitution states officials can not hold two offices concurrently. Consequently, on 28 May 2018, Cartes offered his resignation as President, which would have to be agreed to by Congress. Legislators were opposed to Cartes resigning and taking up the seat, stating it was unconsitutional. Opposition leaders were successful in blocking Cartes's resignation by boycotting the vote and not allowing a quorum to be present to vote on the resignation. Cartes withdrew his bid to resign and be sworn in as a senator on 26 June 2018 after not receiving enough political support to carry through his plans.\n\nLeading to the 2013 presidential election, Cartes made controversial statements on the LGBT community, comparing it to \"monkeys\". He also said he would \"shoot myself in the bollocks\" if he were to discover a son who wanted to marry another man.\n\nOn 10 August 2018, when asked by a journalist about his response to a series of citizen protests on Yacyretá Dam deals and congressmen with pending criminal cases, Cartes responded \"Rubber bullets\". Cartes later apologized for the remark, stating, \"I want to express my apologies to the young people for the published expressions. I always encouraged them to express themselves and my goal is the peace of all Paraguayans\".\n\n"}

{"id": "31675294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31675294", "title": "Lean higher education", "text": "Lean higher education\n\nLean Higher Education (LHE) refers to the adaptation of lean thinking to higher education, typically with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. Lean, originally developed at the Toyota Motor Corporation, is a management philosophy that emphasizes \"respect for people\" and \"continuous improvement\" as core tenets. Lean encourages employees at all organizational levels to re-imagine services from a customer's point of view, removing process steps that do not add value and emphasizing steps that add the most value. While the concept of \"customers\" and \"products\" is controversial in higher education settings, there are certainly diverse stakeholders who are interested in the success of colleges and universities, the most common of which are students, faculty, administrators, potential employers and various levels of government.\n\nLean in higher education has been applied both to administrative and academic services. Balzer (2010) described such initiatives within university settings, including the critical factors for success and ways to measure progress. He noted that LHE can be effective to respond to higher education's heightened expectations, reducing expenses in an era of rising costs, meeting demands of public accountability, and leveraging institutional resources to fulfill the educational, scholarship, and outreach missions of higher education. A comprehensive literature review examining Lean's impact on higher education has been published. The authors reported that Lean has a significant and measurable impact when used to improve academic and administrative operations. Such improvements are effective at the department/unit level or throughout an entire institution. However, the authors noted that implementing Lean is a serious undertaking that is most impactful if it involves long-term, strategic planning.\n\nThough the application of Lean management in higher education is more prevalent in administrative processes (e.g., admissions, registration, HR, and procurement) it also has been applied to academic processes (e.g., course design and teaching, improving degree programs, student feedback, and handling of assignments) in an increasing number of cases.\n\nPioneering academic institutions who have implemented Lean include: Cardiff University (Wales), Edinburgh Napier University (Scotland), Michigan Technological University (USA), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (USA), University of Aberdeen (Scotland), University of Central Oklahoma (USA), University of St. Andrews (Scotland), Winona State University (USA) and others. A group of universities in the U.K. have formed LeanHEHub . In Scotland, the Scottish Higher Education Improvement Network (SHEIN) is a collaborative network of HE professionals working within the area of continuous improvement. SHEIN exists to encourage the sharing of resources and best practice, online and face-to-face.\n\nOf great importance in the application of Lean management in any organization is the recognition and daily practice of the Lean principles: \"Continuous Improvement\" and \"Respect for People.\" The \"Respect for People\" principle is challenging for management to implement, because most managers have risen to their level of responsibility based on their superior \"fire-fighting\" skills. With Lean, managers are coaches who guide their employees through a problem solving process. The employee learns how to ask themselves the questions that enable them to solve problems on their own, with the same or better quality that the manager would have achieved. Problems occur when managers cannot relinquish control, resulting in zero-sum (win-lose) outcomes for people and inferior results. In other words, one party gains at another party's expense, and the losers are much less willing to participate in continuous improvement. This outcome impedes teamwork and information flows, and discourages daily efforts by administration, faculty, and staff to improve processes. In order to function properly, Lean management must be understood and practiced in a plus-sum (win-win) manner. The \"Respect for People\" principle is required in order to sustain continuous improvement .\n\nThe origins of Lean practices date from late 19th- and early 20th-century industrial engineering. Lean practices have evolved over the decades since then to become much easier for non-specialists to understand and use. It is now common for people with backgrounds and interests far from industrial engineering to become highly competent Lean management practitioners. Therefore, the Lean management system has the benefit that everyone in an organization can apply the practices without the need for specialists.\n\nSeminal work in the application of Lean to academic processes was done by Prof. M.L. \"Bob\" Emiliani when he was at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the early 2000s and is described in two papers: M.L. \"Bob\" Emiliani (2004) \"Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices,\" and M.L. \"Bob\" Emiliani (2005) \"Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs,\". The former paper describes what individual faculty can do to improve their courses and delivery using Lean principles and practices. The latter paper describes what teams of faculty, staff, administrators, students, alumni, and employers can do to improve their courses using kaizen (literal translation: \"change for the better\"). Prof. Emiliani also produced a Kaizen Team Leader's Manual for improving academic courses and programs based on his work.\n\nThe use of Lean practices in academic processes are described in two papers written by Prof. Emiliani cited above (Refs. 2,3), and in the book \"Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes\".\n\nLean in HE follows the same principles and practices of Lean management as applied in service, manufacturing, or government sectors. Lean management readily takes into account the unique governance structures of higher education institutions. Lean management is responsive to the needs of multiple stakeholders in a non-zero-sum fashion and is therefore well-suited for the governance and ongoing improvement of HEIs.\n\nThe business of teaching in, or the back office administration of, Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) is similar to Lean management practiced in other service sectors because teaching and administration consist of repeatable transactional processes, in whole or part. Guidance for Lean implementation in HE administration, and, to a lesser extent in teaching, is presented in the book \"Lean Higher Education, Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes\".\n\nThe impact of Lean in HE (namely in academic activities), have been studied and found to be potentially beneficial. The benefits include lead-time reduction, increase in throughput, lower cost, increased student satisfaction scores, etc. Reports analyzing Lean in higher education indicate that Lean principles are being successfully applied.\n\nThe principal criticisms of Lean management are well known, relatively few in number, and have been constant over time. Workers may view Lean management as undesirable if it is incorrectly implemented, because it could make them work harder, they might have less time to spend with customers, and, ultimately, they could lose their jobs. These criticisms, which will surely be voiced by faculty and staff in HE, are predictable and the result of zero-sum (win-lose) application of Lean management by senior managers.\n\nSupporters of Lean might assert that Lean management can be conducted in a non-zero-sum (win-win) manner—the criticism is simply a result of misapplication of the central concepts.\n\n\n"}

As of 2006, the company has the world's largest electronic database for legal and public-records related information.\n\nCurrently a division of RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier), LexisNexis was first a product of the Mead Data Central company.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch publishing company Reed Elsevier has owned LexisNexis and its predecessor company since 1994. At its inception in 1970, the database was named LEXIS by Mead Data Central (MDC), a subsidiary of the Mead Corporation. It was a continuation of an experiment organized by the Ohio State Bar in 1967.\n\nOn April 2, 1973, LEXIS launched publicly, offering full-text search in all Ohio and New York cases. In 1980, LEXIS completed its hand-keyed electronic archive of all U.S. federal and state cases. The NEXIS service, added that same year, gave journalists a searchable database of news articles. LexisNexis' world headquarters is located in New York City, United States. In 1989, MDC acquired the Michie Company, a legal publisher, from Macmillan.\n\nWhen Toyota launched the Lexus line of luxury vehicles in 1987, Mead Data Central sued for trademark infringement on the grounds that consumers of upscale products (such as lawyers) would confuse \"Lexus\" with \"Lexis\". A market research survey asked consumers to identify the spoken word \"Lexis\". Survey results showed that a nominal number of people thought of the computerized legal search system; a similarly small number thought of Toyota's luxury car division. A judge ruled against Toyota, and the company appealed the decision. Mead lost on appeal in 1989 when the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit held that there was little chance of consumer confusion. Today, the two companies have an amicable business relationship, and in 2002 implemented a joint promotion called \"Win a Lexus on Lexis!\"\n\nIn December 1994, Mead sold the LexisNexis system to Reed Elsevier for $1.5 billion. The U.S. state of Illinois subsequently audited Mead's income tax returns and charged Mead an additional $4 million in income tax and penalties for the sale of LexisNexis; Mead paid the tax under protest, then sued for a refund in an Illinois state court. On April 15, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with Mead that the Illinois courts had incorrectly applied the Court's precedents on whether Illinois could constitutionally apply its income tax to Mead, an out-of-state, Ohio-based corporation. The Court reversed and remanded so that the lower courts could apply the correct test and determine whether Mead and Lexis were a \"unitary\" business.\n\nIn 2000, LexisNexis purchased RiskWise, a St. Cloud, Minnesota company. Also in 2000, the company acquired the American legal publisher Matthew Bender from Times Mirror. In 2002 it acquired a Canadian research database company, Quicklaw. In 2002, LexisNexis acquired the Ohio legal publisher Anderson Publishing. In 2004, Reed Elsevier Group, parent company of LexisNexis, purchased Seisint, Inc, from founder Michael Brauser of Boca Raton, Florida. Seisint housed and operated the Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX).\n\nOn March 9, 2005, LexisNexis announced the possible theft of personal information of some Seisint users. It was originally estimated that 32,000 users were affected, but that number greatly increased to over 310,000. Affected persons were provided with free fraud insurance and credit bureau reports for a year. However, no reports of identity theft or fraud were discovered to have stemmed from the security breach.\n\nIn February 2008, Reed Elsevier purchased data aggregator ChoicePoint (previous NYSE ticker symbol CPS) in a cash deal for US$3.6 billion. The company was rebranded as LexisNexis Risk Solutions.\n\nIn November 2014, LexisNexis Risk Solutions bought Health Market Science (HMS), a supplier of high quality data about US healthcare professionals.\n\nLexisNexis services are delivered via two websites that require separate paid subscriptions.\n\nAccording to a company news release, LexisNexis hosts over 30 terabytes of content on its 11 mainframes (supported by over 300 midrange UNIX servers and nearly 1,000 Windows NT servers) at its main datacenter in Miamisburg, Ohio. The Lexis database contains current United States statutes and laws and a large volume of published case opinions dating from the 1770s to the present, as well as publicly available unpublished case opinions from 1980 onward. In 2000, Lexis began building a library of briefs and motions. In addition to this, Lexis also has libraries of statutes, case judgments and opinions for jurisdictions such as France, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, South Africa and the United Kingdom as well as databases of law review and legal journal articles for countries for which materials are available.\n\nPreviously, LexisNexis had a stripped-down free version (known as LexisOne) but this has been discontinued\nand replaced by Lexis Communities, which provides news and blogs across a variety of legal areas.\n\nTime Matters is a LexisNexis-branded software offering. Lexis for Microsoft Office is a LexisNexis-branded software offering.\n\nIn France, the UK and Australia, LexisNexis publishes books, magazines and journals, both in hard copy and online. Titles include \"Taxation Magazine\" and \"Lawyers Weekly\".\n\nThe organization that eventually became LexisNexis UK was founded in 1818 by Henry Butterworth (1786–1860) . He was a pupil at King Henry VIII School, Coventry. After leaving Coventry he was apprenticed to and, for some time, worked for his uncle Joseph Butterworth, the great law bookseller of Fleet Street. In 1818, however, disagreement between them as to the terms of partnership made Henry set up on his own account at the corner of Middle Temple Gate (7 Fleet Street), where he became the well-known Queen's Law Bookseller.\n\nButterworths was acquired by International Publishing Corporation in 1965; IPC was acquired by the Reed Group in 1970. Heinemann Professional Publishing was merged with Butterworths Scientific in 1990 to form Butterworth-Heinemann. The Butterworths publishing business is now owned and operated in the UK by Reed Elsevier (UK) Ltd, a company in the Reed Elsevier Group. Publications continue to be produced by RELX (UK) Ltd using the \"LexisNexis\", \"Butterworths\" and \"Tolley\" trade marks. Such publications include \"Halsbury's Laws of England\" and the \"All England Law Reports\", amongst others.\n\nThe Butterworths name is also used to publish works in many countries such as Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nLexisNexis also produces a range of software, services and products which are designed to support the practice of the legal profession. For example, case management systems, customer relationship management systems (\"CRMs\"), practice management systems, electronic disclosure systems, background checking and identity verification products.\n\nPursuant to instructions from Chinese authorities, in 2017 LexisNexis withdrew Nexis and LexisNexis Academic from China.\n\nInterAction is a customer relationship management system designed specifically for professional services firms such as accountancy and legal firms.\n\nBusiness Insight Solutions offers news and business content and market intelligence tools. It is a global provider of news and business information and market intelligence tools for professionals in risk management, corporate, political, media, and academic markets.\n\nIn 2013, LexisNexis, together with Reed Elsevier Properties SA, acquired publishing brands and businesses of Sheshunoff and A.S. Pratt from Thompson Media Group.\n\nSheshunoff Information Services, A.S. Pratt, & Alex Information (collectively, SIS), founded in 1972, is a print and electronic publishing company that provides information to financial and legal professionals in the banking industry, as well as online training and tools for financial institutions. SIS was founded in 1971 by Alex and Gabrielle Sheshunoff. The company became recognized for providing guidance and analysis to the banking industry. In 1988 Thompson Media, a division of Thompson Reuters, acquired the company. Separately, the Sheshunoffs began publishing Alex Information products.\n\nIn 1995 SIS acquired A.S. Pratt & Sons. Established in 1933, \"Pratt's Letter\" is believed to be the second oldest continuously published newsletter in the country behind \"Kiplinger's Washington Letter\", which began publication in 1923. A.S. Pratt is a provider of regulatory law and compliance work tools for the financial services industry.\n\nGabrielle Sheshunoff returned in 2004 to unite the AlexInformation, Sheshunoff, and A.S. Pratt brands before it was sold to Thompson in 2008.\n\n\n\n"}

The quantity produced by the incumbent firm to act as a deterrent to entry is usually larger than would be optimal for a monopolist, but might still produce higher economic profits than would be earned under perfect competition.\n\nThe problem with limit pricing as strategic behavior is that once the entrant has entered the market, the quantity used as a threat to deter entry is no longer the incumbent firm's best response. This means that for limit pricing to be an effective deterrent to entry, the threat must in some way be made credible. A way to achieve this is for the incumbent firm to constrain itself to produce a certain quantity whether entry occurs or not. An example of this would be if the firm signed a union contract to employ a certain (high) level of labor for a long period of time. Another example is to build excess production capacity as a commitment device.\n\nIt is important to note that due to the often ambiguous nature of cost in production, it may be relatively easy for a firm to avoid legal difficulties when undertaking such action. Due to this ambiguous nature, limit pricing may well be a commonly used strategy even in modern economies. However, it is often very hard to regulate, since limit pricing is often synonymous with a market monopoly. When a monopoly exists, it becomes very difficult to compare alternative prices with other, similar firms to confirm claims that limit pricing may be occurring.\n\nIn a simple case, suppose industry demand for good X at market price P is given by:\n\nSuppose there are two potential producers of good X, Firm A, and Firm B.

The profit-maximizing monopoly price charged by Firm A is then:\n\nSince Firm B will never sell below its marginal cost, as long as formula_6, Firm B will not enter the market when Firm A charges formula_7. That is, the market for good X is an effective monopoly if:\n\nSuppose, on the contrary, that:\n\nIn this case, if Firm A charges formula_7, Firm B has an incentive to enter the market, since it can sell a positive quantity of good X at a price above its marginal cost, and therefore make positive profits. In order to prevent Firm B from having an incentive to enter the market, Firm A must set its price no greater than formula_3. To maximize its profits subject to this constraint, Firm A sets price formula_12 (the limit price).\n\n"}

{"id": "36156441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36156441", "title": "Logic-based therapy", "text": "Logic-based therapy\n\nLogic-based therapy (LBT) is a proposed modality of philosophical counseling developed by philosopher Elliot D. Cohen beginning in the mid-1980s. It is a philosophical variant of rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), which was developed by psychologist Albert Ellis. However, there have been no independent, controlled studies to measure its therapeutic value or advantages over classical REBT.\n\nAccording to the theory of LBT, people decide to make themselves upset emotionally and behaviorally by deducing self-defeating emotional and behavioral conclusions from irrational premises. LBT retains the theoretical base of the cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, insofar as it contends emotional and behavioral problems to be rooted in malignant and maladaptive thought processes and patterns. LBT considers itself not only a type of philosophical counseling, but a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. At the same time, LBT remains firmly planted in philosophy by way of the use of formal logic, informal logic, phenomenological intentionality, and philosophical antidotes in conceptualizing and treating mental disorders and psychosocial difficulties.\n\nIn contrast to classical REBT, LBT recasts REBT's A-B-C model of psychological disturbance into syllogistic logic. According to classical REBT, there are three psychological points: Point A (Activating event), Point B (Belief system), and Point C (behavioral and emotional Consequence). Ellis argued that the Activating event itself does not cause people to be upset (C); they require also a set of Beliefs that, in conjunction with the event, causes a self-defeating behavioral and emotional Consequence. For example, it is not just having recently been divorced (Point A) that causes a depression (point C), but also the belief that this event is awful and the worst thing that could have happened. Thus, according to Ellis, by finding the particular Activating event and Belief, one can find out what is causing one's depression (C). Clients can then work on changing their Belief system and their behavior to overcome the depression.\n\nLBT translates the A-B-C model of psychological disturbance into a form of deductive logic, in particular, syllogistic logic. According to its logic-based approach, the causal model Ellis advanced is not accurate. The depression is not caused by events that occur inside (Point B) and outside (Point A) one's subjective world. Instead, one decides to feel depressed by deducing a conclusion from a set of premises. For example, one may depress oneself by setting up this syllogism:\n\n\nA syllogism is a deductive form of reasoning having two premises and a conclusion. The idea that the reasoning behind our emotions and behavior can be so ordered in terms of a syllogism was in fact an insight of Aristotle, who called this kind of syllogism a \"practical syllogism.\" The distinctive feature of this type of deductive reasoning is that the conclusion prescribes something. That is, it evaluates or rates the thing in question instead of merely describing it. For example, in concluding that something is terrible, a person is negatively rating it, and therefore will act or tend to act and feel negatively toward it. In fact, Aristotle went so far as to claim that the conclusion of a practical syllogism was always an action.\n\nAccording to LBT, by syllogizing one's behavioral and emotional reasoning in terms of the practical syllogism, one is in a better position to find one's irrational premises, refute them, and replace the unsound reasoning with sound \"antidotal\" reasoning. For example, the first premise in the above syllogism is irrational because one is exaggerating just how bad the divorce is (thinking of it as though it were on the level of a catastrophic disease or natural disaster).\n\nLBT also accepts the phenomenological thesis that every mental state, including emotions, has a so-called \"intentional object\" or \"object of the mind.\" That is, there is always an object to which a mental state refers or is about. Thus, if one is depressed, then one is depressed \"about\" something. This intentional object is represented in the descriptive minor premise of the emotional reasoning, for example, the premise \"I was divorced\" in the aforementioned syllogism. In addition, the syllogisms comprising emotional reasoning always rate the emotional object or some aspect of it. For example, in the aforementioned syllogism, one rates one's divorce as being \"terrible\". This rating element is represented in the consequent (then clause) of the major premise of the syllogism, as in the premise \"If I was divorced, then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\" Accordingly, the syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be constructed by first finding the intentional object (O) of one's emotion; and second, by finding the rating (R) of the emotion. As such, the valid, hypothetical structure of a syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be symbolized as follows:\n\n\nFurther, according to LBT, all emotions can be uniquely identified by their specific object (O) and rating (R) elements. For example, the O of anger is always an action; and the rating is a strong negative evaluation of the action itself or the individual performing the action. In depression, the O is an event or state of affairs; and the R is a strong negative rating of the said event or state of affairs, on the basis of which one strongly negatively rates one's own existence. Thus, one may rate one's divorce as terrible, on the basis of which one gives one's own existence a strongly negatively evaluation.\n\nLBT permits clients to trace their inferences to higher order premises that might be at the root of an emotional and behavioral disturbance. For example, by questioning why having been divorced is so bad, another higher level syllogism can be uncovered:\n\n\nEven higher order premises at the root of the behavioral and emotional disturbance can be uncovered, for example, by asking why being divorced makes one a worthless loser. For example, this higher order syllogism might be uncovered:\n\n\nIn this way, the depression can be traced back to a demand for perfection from which a person is deducing their own worthlessness, from which they are in turn deducing the horribleness of what happened.\n\nIn contrast to classical REBT, LBT identifies positive virtues that can be used to guide a person in overcoming his or her irrational beliefs. According to LBT, all basic irrational beliefs (\"cardinal fallacies\") identified by REBT theorists and philosophers are related to \"transcendent virtues\" that can overcome them. The following chart displays each such irrational belief and its respective trumping virtue:\n\nLBT thereby includes a \"positive psychology\" in addition to the classical REBT emphasis on refuting irrational beliefs. As a philosophical counseling approach, LBT also applies philosophical antidotes derived from the philosophies of antiquity to help clients strive toward their transcendent virtues. For example, the Kantian categorical imperative that says to \"treat oneself and others as ends in themselves and not as mere means\" can be used as an antidote to damnation of self or others, and thus as a sort of recipe to attaining the transcendent virtue of respect for self and others. Similarly, Frederich Nietzsche's theory about human suffering, which says that suffering can make one stronger and nobler, can be used as an antidote to catastrophic thinking (\"Awfulizing\") about personal loss, thereby building courage in confronting the loss and using it to create new positive meanings and values in one's existence.\n\nLBT also emphasizes willpower in changing and redirecting beliefs and actions. While it makes no commitment to the existence of free will in any metaphysical sense, it recognizes the practical value of building \"willpower muscle\" as a means to overcoming cognitive dissonance and working towards one's transcendent virtues. LBT emphasizes and promotes the power one has to change the way in which an event or situation is interpreted by altering one's thought patterns.\n\nWhile LBT is a form of philosophical counseling, since it addresses client's emotional problems and provides systematic ways of resolving them it can also be considered a form of psychotherapy. More specifically, because its focus on the client's cognitions and behaviors in relation to emotional functioning and relationship with REBT it is also a type of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). However, LBT differentiates itself from some other forms of CBT by emphasizing how premises about emotions are deduced and inferred from experiences in the world: LBT suggests that all emotional responses have a logical structure to them. The fact that emotions contain logical structures which can be subject to investigation and revision was also supported in the philosopher Robert C. Solomon's cognitivist theory of emotions.\nLBT further differs from other forms of psychotherapy. For example, psychoanalytic or psychodynamic traditions will look for the underlying causes of emotional problems. These approaches will explore the client's early relationships with significant others (e.g., parental figures) and their effect on current relationships and resultant emotional and behavioral disturbances. Interpretation is utilized to provide the client with insights into their psychic organization. In contrast (but like other types of CBT), LBT does not place any particular emphasis on past relationships or the causes of problems and is even less concerned with interpretation. Instead, LBT remains philosophical insofar as it examines reasoning and logical structures created by client. The emphasis is not on the \"why\" of a problem, but on the \"how\"; that is, how the person deduces their emotional position and ways in which to alter it for more adaptive thinking and functioning.\n\nLBT's emphasis on the \"willpower muscle\" suggests the ability of agency and choice in regard to therapeutic change. Based upon the rejection of a deterministic causative framework in favor of a nondeterministic perspective, LBT maintains compatibility with existentialism and existential psychotherapy. This position of choice is central to existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre's thinking on human freedom and responsibility, which is one of existential psychotherapist Irvin Yalom's \"existential givens\". Here, clients are encouraged to confront their inherent freedom by way of choosing how to interpret situations. As philosopher Martin Heidegger and others have suggested, clients can become a \"master over moods\" by taking responsibility for their moods and emotions and subsequently revising them. Furthermore, this can lead to different ways of thinking about and experiencing the world with the accompanied creation of new meanings in life.\n\nLBT emphasizes the client's used of deductive logic in their emotional reasoning, which places focus on the cognitive aspect of emotion. As such, it ignores the importance of physiological states and bodily sensations to emotional life, and might be an overly cognitive approach and a way to \"control\" emotions. However, LBT contends that it is the entire experience that contributes to the person's emotional reasoning. This includes the experienced event, any thoughts or beliefs related to the event as well as physiological reactions.\n\nWith a LBT counselor's knowledge of deductive logic, a power differential may be created between the counselor and the client. This could result in the client seeking the \"correct\" way of deducing premises and develop an overreliance on the LBT counselor. However, the goal is to create more flexible and open ways of interpreting the world and extinguish \"absolutist\" thinking or unrealistic expectations as a result of a collaborative therapeutic relationship. However, understanding and changing one's inferences and logical structures requires a certain level of intellectual ability, and consequently, may limit the application.\n\nAlthough an activating event, such as a divorce or loss of a job, objectively is not on the same level as a catastrophic event, rushing to the conclusion that it is irrational for the client to think that way is potentially invalidating the intensity of the client's subjective emotional experience. Regardless, empathic understanding and the building of therapeutic rapport is an important component to all psychotherapies and counseling methods and is no less important in LBT.\n\nWhile LBT may be conceptually sound and have firm theoretical roots, much of psychotherapy and counseling research emphasizes the importance of evidence-based practice, that is, interventions and therapeutic approaches that have scientific evidence for their efficacy. Given this, to establish LBT's efficacy and effectiveness empirical validation must occur through psychotherapy research methodology if it is to be considered valid by the psychotherapeutic or counseling communities. Although no such evidence is available, anecdotal evidence for LBT's effectiveness as well as its close relationship with CBT presents it as a possible therapeutic modality.\n\n\n"}

A manager has an incentive to invest the firm's resources in assets whose value is higher under him than under the best alternative manager, even when such investments are not value-maximizing.\n\nWhen managers hold little equity and shareholders are too dispersed to take action against non-value maximization behavior, insiders may deploy corporate actions to obtain personal benefits, such as shirking and perquisite consumption. When ownership and control is divided within a company, agency costs arise. However agency costs decline if the ownership within the company increases as managers are responsible for a larger cost of these shares. On the other hand, given ownership to a manager within a company may translate into greater voting power which makes the manager's workplace more secure. Hence, they gain protection against takeover threats and the current managerial market.\n\nThere are a variety of entrenchment practices that managers may employ, such as poison pills, super majority amendments, anti-takeover devices, or the so-called golden parachutes.\n\nThere are associations between managerial entrenchment and capital structure decisions which mostly result on the fact that CEOs are reluctant to go into debt when funding an investment. The capital structure is the way that the company chooses to fund its own operations and growth. Debt comes in the form of bond issues or long-term notes payable, while equity is classified as common stock, preferred stock or retained earnings.\n\nMany models suggest that the manager keeps the leverage level according to where the firm mostly maximizes its value. The efficient choice of debt (optimal for shareholders) generally differs from the entrenchment choice (optimal for managers whose objective is to maximize tenure).\n\nCross-sectional studies suggest that there is low leverage on firms where the CEO has characteristics associated with entrenchment. A characteristic would be if the CEO has years of experience in the same company. Low leverage was also persistent in companies which had no pressure or strong discipline over their CEOs. Events like the involuntary departure of the CEO and the arrival of a new large stockholder would gradually increase the levels of leverage comparing to before the events were to occur. Leverage also increases after CEOs are subjected to greater performance incentives in the form of increased inventories of stock options.\n\nMoreover, during takeover threats, managers tend to increase debt in order to increase the firm's value, making it more difficult for the takeover to occur. However, this does not necessarily mean that the manager's job is secure. In a sample of target firms that levered up the most, 37 percent of the managers lost their jobs within a year of the failed takeover attempt.\n\nAccording to the above research, there are three possible actions managers could take to entrench themselves in association with the gearing ratio:\n\nCorporate governance essentially involves balancing the interests of the many stakeholders in a company - these include its shareholders, employees, management, customers, suppliers, financiers, government and the community. A stronger corporate governance is associated with a higher firm valuation and corporate governance mechanisms can be classified into a number of categories such as regulatory mechanisms, disclosures, shareholder rights, ownership structures, and board monitoring.\n\nHowever through management entrenchment, ownership structure (one of the corporate governance mechanisms) changes in that way which benefits the managers. We already know from the above information that managers have a greater voting power while they are entrenched. A study carried out by Mock et al. on the relationship between manager ownership and firm's value found that as manager ownership increases, the firm's value increases as well, however not in the case where the manager is entrenched. The convergence-of-interest hypothesis suggests that a firm's market valuation should rise as its management owns an increasingly large portion of the firm. On the other hand, the entrenchment hypothesis suggests that as management increases its ownership, the incentive to maximize value declines as market discipline becomes less effective against a larger shareholding manager.\n\nHence the entrenchment effect will dominate the incentive effect only for medium concentrated levels of management ownership.\n\nCredit unions have a different approach towards management entrenchment and corporate governance. Since credit unions lack principal-agent governance between shareholders and other members, managers already enjoy benefits and job entrenchments that are not based on their performance. Given the theoretical predictions of Fudenberg and Tirole (1995) and the empirical research by Kanagaretnam, Lobo and Mathieu (2003) we predict that credit union managers with higher comparative levels of salary and perquisites (and limited outside opportunities) will aggressively engage in accounting manipulations when job security is threatened.\n\nBut to what extent are these managers willing to manipulate when capital requirements of credit unions are not met?\n\nTriggering regulations to meet capital requirements for a credit union is very costly, but censuring accounting arbitrage is very costly at the same time. However, some argue the expected costs of regulatory violation are larger than the reputation costs of censure from capital management.\n\nTherefore, managers have three good reasons to involve and censure their accounting manipulations:\nNowadays, there are several articles and essays on how to accomplish a proper entrenched management exercise without hurting shareholders, yet not abuse them–for example–when a board of directives is given the power to take corporate decisions in certain matters, where the corporation will be protected against hostile takeovers. Nonetheless, this form of corporate governance may cause distinct reaction on shares prices, which is why entrenchment management is not an easy concept to accomplish. Along with corporate governance, entrenchment management requires a lot of research and good management from the corporate market.\n\nIn practice, entrenched CEOs tend to get higher salary than non-entrenched CEOs. A survey has been conducted. which results suggest that entrenched CEO give higher salaries to their workers compared to non-entrenched CEOs. Because cash flow rights ownership by the CEO and better corporate governance are found to mitigate such behaviour, we interpret the higher pay as evidence of agency problems between shareholders and managers affecting workers' pay.\n\nIn a very real sense, unions and managers compete to offer benefits to employees. Since entrenched CEO pay their workers high salaries, the CEO-worker relationship improves, making workers less likely to unionize. Often workers perceive managers' benefits to be more beneficial for them than unions. This leads us to the conclusion that entrenched CEOs have the characteristic of being very competitive when it comes to work loyalty.\n"}

He collected and published ancient hymns and folk songs which is his finest contribution to the preservation of Nepalese cultural heritage. \n\nTuladhar was born to a merchant family at Asan Kamalachhi, Kathmandu. His father was Ratna Das and mother Laxmi Shobha Tuladhar. When he was 16 years old, he was married to Dhan Maya, the daughter of Dharma Sundar Tuladhar of Dhalasikwa, Kathmandu.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1921, the burden of running the household fell on him, and he went to Lhasa, Tibet to take over the family shop. It wasn't very successful, so he returned to Kathmandu. Later, he moved to Kalimpong and then Sikkim in India and engaged in various businesses. He returned to Nepal after a few years.\n\nIn 1931, Tuladhar and a group of other liberal-minded people including poet Yogbir Singh Kansakar started a movement to reform traditional religious customs. They were arrested and publicly flogged for their activities by the Rana regime. They were then brought before the prime minister and released after a warning \"not to indulge in such mischievous activities again\".\n\nIn 1934, Tuladhar teamed up with his nephew poet Chittadhar Hridaya and opened a bicycle shop named Mandas Chittadhar. It gradually transformed into a book store as both uncle and nephew were keen readers. Access to education and books was difficult at the time, and their book store became a hub for students and writers. Subsequently, Tuladhar established two publishing firms named Mandas Sugatdas and Himalaya Pioneer Publication to promote writers and expand the country's corpus of books.\n\nTuladhar's other interest was Nepal Bhasa poetry, and he spent 48 years collecting hymns, folk songs and sacred texts in an effort to preserve Nepal's literary, cultural and musical heritage. He toured the Kathmandu Valley and gathered thousands of Hindu and Buddhist hymns in Nepal Bhasa and 275 Sanskrit songs, becoming an authority on old songs. He has published a number of anthologies that have proved valuable for researchers.\n\nA major achievement of this quest was his discovery of the original manuscript of the play \"Mahasattva\" (महासत्व) written by King Rajendra Bikram Shah in 1831. The play is based on a Buddhist story.\n\nIn 1997, Tuladhar's son Sugatdas set up the Mandas Buddha Bodhigyana Foundation with the aim of continuing his work of publishing and preserving Buddhist books. The foundation also operates the Bodhigyana Library which opened in 1999.\n"}

This could include sales teams, employees, vendors, partners, affiliates or anyone else the marketer determines needs the access. In general these platforms are tasked with the following features:\nOver time, most supply chains can grow cumbersome and unwieldy as new partners, new products and new technologies are added, resulting in increased cost, decreased service levels and an overall loss of control. Some of the world’s largest consulting firms estimate that up to 60% of marketing costs are related to non-product ancillary areas (distribution, people, freight, storage, obsolescence, technology, inventory management, etc.).\n\nCompanies have tackled cost reduction from a \"largest spend first\" philosophy. As a result, some very substantial cost savings opportunities are often overlooked, such as indirect materials and supplies – those products and services that are not a core or direct part of the company’s finished product.\n\nBy taking a complete marketing supply chain approach, identifying inefficiencies and developing best business practices, companies can improve their marketing supply chain process. Outsourcing the process can help manage total marketing supply chain cost, and can provide an opportunity for measurement in marketing, one of the major challenges in the profession.\n"}

Stroke and Wiggers pointed out that a global financial and economic crisis will come, because of its systemic dependencies on a few rating agencies. After the breakout of the crisis Alan Greenspan agreed to this opinion in 2007. At least the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report confirmed this point of view in 2011.\n\nIn 1998, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corporation announced a merger, valued at 38 billion, resulting in a change in company name to \"DaimlerChrysler AG\". The merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Wiggers' concept of a platform strategy like the VW Group, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were too low. As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes's 3.2L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.\n\nChrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion in 2006. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008..

{"id": "2632136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2632136", "title": "Online counseling", "text": "Online counseling\n\nOnline counseling is the provision of professional mental health counseling services through the Internet. Services are typically offered via email, real-time chat, and video conferencing. Some clients use online counseling in conjunction with traditional psychotherapy, or nutritional counseling, and a growing number of clients are using online counseling as a replacement for office visits.\n\nWhile some form of tele-psychology has been available for over 35 years, the advent of internet video chat systems and the increasing penetration of broadband has resulted in a growing movement towards online therapy. Many of the methods used to facilitate online therapy sessions include a multimedia access platform such as TalkSpace, BetterHelp, and 7 Cups Online Therapy. Both of which enable users to receive initial treatment and therapy in a safe and discreet manner. Clients are using videoconferencing, live chat and email with professional psychologists in place of or in addition to face-to-face meetings.\n\nSince the beginning of the internet in 1972, several creative people perceived the potential of the internet for the therapeutic communication. In 1972, computers from Stanford and UCLA simulated a psychotherapy session that was considered the very beginning of online counseling. At the time the internet went public, this launch went hand in hand with the development of the first self-help groups on the internet who were, in that time, very popular. In 1995, Martha Ainsworth had a couple of psychological complaints where she wanted to get rid of it, so she began searching for a competent therapist. Because her travel requirements made it difficult for her to consult a face-to-face therapist, she searched for an effective alternative online, but only found a dozen webpages that offered online treatment for psychological complaints. Afterwards, Martha Ainsworth wanted to reach the general public with her experiences and founded a sort of clearinghouse for mental health websites, named Metanoia. This database seemed to be a very efficient store-room and by the year 2000, this clearinghouse contained over 250 websites of private practices, and more than 700 online clinics where a therapist could be contacted.\n\nAccording to metanoia.org, the first service to offer online mental healthcare was \"Ask Uncle Ezra\", created by staff of Cornell University in 1986 for students. By mid-1995 several fee-based online services offering mental health advice had appeared.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2002, a group of trained volunteer crisis counselors called \"Samaritans\", began providing suicide prevention services via email.\n\nA growing body of research into online counseling has established the efficacy of online therapy with treatment outcomes at least equal to traditional in-office settings. The number of missed appointments is much less than with in-person therapy.\n\nOnline counseling is also filling the unmet need for clients located in areas traditionally under-served by traditional counselors. Rural residents and expats along with under-served minorities often have an easier time finding a suitable therapist online than in their local communities. \n\nOnline counseling has also been shown to be effective for clients who may have difficulty reaching appointments during normal business hours. Additionally, research is demonstrating that online counseling may be useful for disabled and rural people that traditionally under-utilize clinical services.\n\nStudies have shown the efficacy of online therapy despite the controversy of cost. Online Platforms such as TalkSpace, BetterHelp, and 7 Cups Online, offer case by case specific therapy methods including \"groups\" as well as one on one sessions. Such methods of online therapy can be sustainable means of getting therapy to the right people and at their own location. One of the key aspects of online therapy is that it can be done at the convenience of the user as well as in a place which the user deems safe and is able to follow through with the therapy.\n\nResearch from G.S. Stofle and J. suggests that online counseling would benefit people functioning at a moderately high level. Severe situations, such as suicidal ideation or a psychotic episode, might be better served by traditional face-to-face methods, although further research may prove otherwise.\n\nCohen and Kerr conducted a study on the effectiveness of online therapy for treatment of anxiety disorders in students and found that there was no difference in the level of change for the two modes as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.\n\nAs the main goal of counseling is to alleviate the distress, anxiety or concerns experienced by a client when he or she enters therapy, online counseling has strong efficacy under that definition. Client satisfaction surveys tend to demonstrate a high level of client satisfaction with online counseling, while the providers sometimes demonstrate lower satisfaction with distance methods.\n\nNutrition counseling specific to conditions is available by many consultants online using Skype or another face-to-face program. This is especially effective for people with a busy work schedule, and others who can't make it to an office regularly. Online consulting for imbalances in blood lipid levels, blood sugar regulation, and other health conditions make it easier to manage when using nutritional approaches.\n\nThere is a split within the counseling field on the validity of online counseling. Some practitioners have suggested that online counseling cannot be considered quality psychotherapy.\n\n"}

Panapasa Balekana co-wrote the anthem's lyrics with his wife while he composed the accompanying music.\n\nThe anthem was adopted by the country upon its independence in 1978 following a government competition.\n\nBalekana was originally from Kandavu, Fiji. He moved to the Solomon Islands in 1953 to work as a mechanic for the government, which was under British colonial administration at the time. He was unmarried when he first moved to the Solomon Islands. He eventually married a Fijian woman, Matila Balekana and resided in the Solomon Islands for most of his adult life. The couple had two children, a son and a daughter.\n\nBalekana \"fell in love\" with the Solomon Islands and decided to stay in the country rather than return to Fiji. On many occasions, Balekana publicly called the Solomon Islands \"my home\".\n\nBalekana and his family joined the Wesley United Church in Honiara. He remained heavily involved with the congregation, serving as a church pastor and choirmaster.\n\nIn the run-up to independence on 7 July 1978, the government of the Solomon Islands decided that it needed a national anthem for the occasion. The government announced on the radio that it would accept submissions from the general public for a new anthem.\n\nPanapasa Balekana and his wife, Matila Balekana, decided to jointly enter the competition as a team. The couple agreed that the new anthem should be in the form of a prayer, asking God to support and guide the new island nation.\n\nBalekana claimed in interviews to have received his inspiration for the anthem in a dream. After he woke up from the dream, Balekana and his wife immediately began writing words and lyrics, as well as composing the tune. Panapasa and Matila Balekana co-wrote the lyrics for the anthem, while Panapasa Balekana composed the accompanying music. The couple credited prayer and God for their success in creating the anthem, noting how well the song came together.\n\nOnce the lyrics and music had been composed, Panapasa and Matila Balekana received help recording the prospective anthem from the Wesley United Church choir at the couple's own congregation. The choir sang the song for the first time, which was recorded on tape and submitted to competition officials.\n\nThe Balekanas' submission, \"God Save Our Solomon Islands\", won the competition, and became the national anthem of the Solomon Islands. It was sung on the country's first independence day, 7 July 1978. Balekana was overjoyed and explained the importance of the anthem and its meaning, \"Solomon Islands national anthem was written in a form of prayer asking God for safe keeping and protection of our new nation. By the power and grace of God, we may receive joy, peace, progress and prosperity, if only we can be able to work together in harmony. These may be the foundation of building our nation, as we can be rest assured that we will reach our destination- stands forever more.\"\n\nPanapasa Balekana retired from his work as a government mechanic in 1988. Following his retirement he became the manager and director of a Solomon Islander soft drink company, Szetu Enterprise.\n\nIn 2000, Panapasa was asked by police to leave the country with his family for his own safety due to the ethnic unrest sweeping the Solomon Islands at the time. Panapasa refused to seek refuge from the violence abroad explaining his loyalty to his adopted country, \"I refused and told them that this is my home and should anything happen, this is where I'm supposed to die, this is the place – my home.\"\n\nPanapasa continued to work as the Wesley United Church choir director until he became too weak in his later years. His son took over the position.\n\nPanapasa Balekana died on 22 January 2009, at his home in Henderson, Solomon Islands, which is located east of the capital city of Honiara. He was 79 years old. He was survived by his wife, daughter, son and five grandchildren.\n\nBalekana was given a state funeral by the Solomon Islands. Balekana's body was laid in state in the main chamber of the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands in the morning of 26 January 2009. VIPs were allowed to lay wreaths in honour of Balekana at the Parliament.\n\nDiginitaries attending the viewing and funeral included the Governor-General of the Solomon Islands Nathaniel Waena. Governor-General Waena and Lady Waena led the viewing procession. Other leading officials at the viewing, by order of precedence, included Prime Minister Dr. Derek Sikua and his wife, Doris Sikua; Speaker to Parliament Sir Peter Kenilorea his wife, Lady Kenilorea; the Chief Justice Sir Albert Palmer; and the Deputy Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Fred Fono and his wife. Several former Governors-General, cabinet members, opposition leaders, members of parliament, the diplomatic corps, and the Mayor of Honiara Andrew Mua also attended the state viewing and funeral.\n\nA procession, which included members of the general public, went from Parliemant to the Wesley United Church in Honiara for the funeral in the afternoon. The national anthem, \"God Save Our Solomon Islands\", was performed during the funeral service in Balekana's honour.\n\nA police escort brought Balekana's body from the church to the cemetery at Number 3, near the Honiara High School, for burial. Wreaths were laid by the public before the casket was lowered into the gravesite.\n\n"}

He is the founder of , a Germany-based manufacturer of outdoor furniture with distribution in more than 80 countries. An outdoor enthusiast, Dekeyser is also the founder of DEDON ISLAND, a luxury resort in the Philippines.\n\nDekeyser was born in Leuven, Belgium, the eldest son of entrepreneurs who divorced when he was young. Raised in Belgium, Austria and Germany, he recalls his childhood as \"chaotic\", leaving him with a deep-seated longing for harmony. A self-described rebel and school truant, he turned to football as a source of discipline and self-esteem. At 14, he won a talent contest, earning himself a place at the New York soccer camp of his idol, the Brazilian striker Pelé, whom he credits with encouraging him to \"follow your dreams\". At the age of 15, having attended nine different schools, Dekeyser stood up in English class and announced that he was dropping out to become a professional footballer.\n\nIn 1980, at the age of 16, Dekeyser joined the Junior A-League team 1. FC Kaiserslautern as goalkeeper, staying with them until 1982, when he was called up for military service in Belgium. On his release, in 1984, he joined Royal Union Saint-Gilloise in Belgium's second division. In 1986, on the recommendation of the FC Bayern Munich goalkeeper Jean-Marie Pfaff, Dekeyser was brought in as a replacement for the team's reserve keeper, who was sidelined with a long-term injury. A year later he was transferred to another Bundesliga team, 1. FC Nürnberg, where he continued to serve as reserve goalkeeper.\n\nAfter a season at Belgium's first-division KRC Genk, Dekeyser transferred in 1989 to TSV 1860 München, where he served as starting goalkeeper. In his sixteenth appearance for the team, he was seriously injured by an elbow blow to the face and spent several weeks in hospital. While in hospital, he learned from the newspapers that he had been replaced as goalkeeper. Despite his anger at the manner of his dismissal, Dekeyser was persuaded to make a three-game comeback for 1860 Munich when the replacement goalkeeper himself was injured. He describes these as the \"best three games of my career\". Although numerous offers from first and second division teams followed, he retired from professional football at the end of the 1990–1991 season.\n\nDekeyser founded his first company, DEDON, while recovering from a facial injury in hospital. He readily admits that he had no business plan or clear idea of what DEDON would do or sell. His motivation was \"to have fun working with family and friends\", which he has since described as a motto of the company. DEDON's first products were hand-painted skis, 80 pairs of which were sold, 50 of them later returned. It was only after a stint selling raffia giraffes imported from Madagascar that the company changed its focus to outdoor furniture.\n\nIn the late 1980s Dekeyser first began to develop his idea of an \"outdoor living room\", furnished with the attention to comfort, quality and aesthetics usually reserved for indoor living rooms. Following his retirement from professional soccer, he worked closely with his uncle, an engineer and expert at plastics extrusion, to create a durable, weather-resistant synthetic fiber (known today as DEDON Fiber) with a natural look and feel. Unsure of how to take his idea of the \"outdoor living room\" further, however, he put it on hold.\n\nThen during a visit to the Cologne furniture fair in 1991, Dekeyser met a furniture manufacturer from Cebu, a Philippine island known for the craftsmanship of its weavers. The manufacturer agreed to help him produce woven rattan furniture using DEDON Fiber. Soon thereafter Dekeyser moved his family to Cebu where he spent six months developing DEDON's first woven products. Upon returning to Germany he and his wife, Ann-Kathrin, purchased an old farm on Lüneburg Heath, close to Hamburg Harbor, where DEDON furniture would then be shipped from the Philippines.\n\nIn its first decade the company, which consisted of a small group of family and friends sharing business duties and chores on the farm, grew slowly. A converted chicken coop served as Dekeyser's office. Furniture deliveries were stored in the barn. In 2000 DEDON opened its own production facility on Cebu so as to better control the design and quality of its furniture. This, along with the adoption of powder-coated aluminum frames, the introduction of more contemporary designs, and the development of innovative marketing campaigns, helped DEDON to grow rapidly. Over the next five years, sales increased by more than 1,300 percent. Within eight years, the Cebu staff expanded from seven to 3,600 employees.\n\nIn 2004 Dekeyser moved the company headquarters to the outskirts of Lüneburg. The headquarters, which included a facility for the production of DEDON Fiber, received media attention in Germany for their relaxed, family-like atmosphere and the many perks employees enjoyed, including billiards, yoga, sauna, gym and a chef. Berlin's \"Der Tagesspiegel\" daily newspaper dubbed Dekeyser's emphasis on employee satisfaction, both in Germany and the Philippines, \"The Bobby Principle\".\n\nIn 2006 Dekeyser sold a 49 percent stake in DEDON to a US-based private equity firm but soon regretted the sale. The \"friendly atmosphere\" of the company was being replaced by a focus on \"money and numbers,\" he later explained. With the financial help of investor Daniel Borer, a Swiss physician, who assumed a minority interest in DEDON in 2009, Dekeyser was able to pay back the bank loans the private equity company had left behind.\n\nAfter the buyback, Dekeyser took steps to restore DEDON's atmosphere and values. He also sought to revitalize the brand's communication, releasing photography campaigns, short films and a limited-edition book all shot by American fashion photographer Bruce Weber, whom Dekeyser has described as \"very much on our wavelength\". Other communications initiatives included the launch of the DEDON Tour du Monde catalog shoot, described as an ongoing, around-the-world journey to discover \"unique places and moments under the open skies\". By spring 2012 the Tour du Monde included stops in Kenya, India, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, the Seychelles, New York City, Megève in France and the Philippine island of Siargao.\n\nDekeyser established relationships with several new designers after the buyback, most notably with Philippe Starck, who launched \"Play\", his first collection for DEDON, at the 2010 Milan Furniture Fair. In a promotional video made at the time, Starck is quoted as saying \"Everybody loves Bobby\". Other designers associated with Dekeyser include Jean-Marie Massaud and Stephen Burks, the latter of whom appeared in a video with Dekeyser to promote the launch of his \"Dala\" collection for DEDON at the 2012 Milan Furniture Fair.\n\nIn 2010, less than a year after Dekeyser's return, DEDON opened a wholly owned US subsidiary, DEDON USA, followed by the launch of DEDON's first US showroom, located in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. A Los Angeles showroom was opened in early 2012. Due to DEDON's growing activities in the US, Dekeyser spent an increasing amount of time in New York City.\n\nIn the spring of 2012 the company opened DEDON ISLAND, a luxury resort with a \"barefoot state of mind\" on the Philippine island of Siargao.\n\nAfter stepping back from operations in 2014, Dekeyser sold his remaining stake in DEDON in December 2016.\n\nIn 2009 Dekeyser co-founded the \"Dekeyser&Friends\" Foundation, which is based in Geneva and with a stated purpose \"to inspire young people to follow their dreams and bring about change in the world\". Since its inception, the foundation has brought young people aged 18 to 28 together for encounters with mentors, or 'friends', such as German Olympic double gold medalist skier Markus Wasmeier and Turkish traditional dance troupe leader Mustafa Erdoğan.\n\nOne initiative of the foundation was the Hamburg-based \"D&F Academy\", described as a \"platform where knowledgeable and inspiring personalities can pass on their experience to young people from around the world in hands-on learning projects\".

He was the son of Philip Lehman (1861–1947), son of Emanuel Lehman, cofounder of Lehman Brothers investment bank, and Carrie Lauer (1865–1937).\n\nHe graduated from Hotchkiss School in 1908 and was a 1913 graduate of Yale University and member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter). When his father retired in 1925, \"Bobbie\" Lehman assumed the leadership role of the family-owned business. He took over the bank during a time when Lehman Brothers, like its competitors Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, was essentially a one-office firm.\n\nWhile sound financial principles were essential, Robert Lehman was often quoted as saying that he \"bet on people.\" One of those people he believed in was Juan Trippe who would build Pan American World Airways into an industry powerhouse. Robert Lehman understood that to maximize Lehman Brothers' growth he needed additional investor capital. While still maintaining voting control, he was the first to invite non-family members to become partners. He understood too that the right partners could expand the company's opportunities through interlocking directorships. As such, he sold an interest in Lehman Brothers to John D. Hertz who had sold his Yellow Cab Company and The Hertz Corporation for a fortune and who sat on the board of directors of General Motors. Under Robert Lehman, the bank concentrated on rapidly developing consumer industries with financing deals arranged in retailing, airlines, and the entertainment business notably with the Keith-Albee-Orpheum theatre group 1928 deal that sold the majority of its stock to Joseph P. Kennedy which led to the creation of RKO motion picture studios. And, when Lehman put together start-up financing for Paramount Pictures, John D. Hertz would be their connection on Paramount's board.\n\nRobert Lehman guided his company through the perils of the stock-market crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression of the 1930s. Post-war, he grew the company substantially, expanding to Paris, France to meet the financial needs of his clients with international operations. In the process, he made himself one of the wealthiest people in the United States.\n\nA lover of horses and a polo enthusiast, Robert Lehman played on a polo team with W. Averell Harriman, Jock Whitney and Tommy Hitchcock, Jr.. He was also a thoroughbred racehorse owner and breeder who had five horses compete in the Kentucky Derby. His horses, most trained by Ralph G. Kercheval, won numerous important stakes races including the Correction Handicap and the Long Island Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack, and the Bernard Baruch Handicap at Saratoga Race Course.\n\nFor six decades he built upon an art collection begun by his father in 1911 and devoted a great deal of time and energy as a long-time member of the Board of Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and finally becoming the first chairman of the board at the Metropolitan in the 1960s. The importance of his collection became such that in 1957, nearly three hundred works were used for a solo exhibit at the Louvre Museum's Musée de l'Orangerie in the Tuileries Gardens in Paris. At that time, his was the only private American collection to be given that honor. In 1968 he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Yale University for having \"enhanced the civic life, the culture, and the artistic development of our civilization.\"\n\nAfter his death in 1969, the Robert Lehman Foundation donated close to 3,000 works of art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Housed in the Robert Lehman Wing, which opened to the public in 1975, the museum has called it \"one of the most extraordinary private art collections ever assembled in the United States\". To this day, his Foundation remains active, operating the Robert Lehman Art Lecture Fund and sponsoring exhibitions in museums, both around the U.S. and worldwide. Other philanthropic activities include support for PBS television programming. The Robert Lehman Art Center at Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts, is named in his honor.\n\nRobert's first marriage—to Ruth S. (née Lamar) Rumsey (born 1902) in May 1929 in Montreal, Canada—ended in a divorce about 1931. Previous to her marriage to Robert, Ruth Lamar had been married to John Williams \"Jack\" Rumsey (1877-1960), who was owner of the Embassy Club (a nightclub in NYC) and president of the American Play Company (an old established literary agency located at 532 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan).\n\nRobert's second marriage, which occurred on June 25, 1934 in Washington, D. C., was to Ruth \"Kitty\" (Leavitt) Meeker (1904–1984), daughter of William Homer Leavitt and Ruth Bryan Owen, and granddaughter of United States Secretary of State, William Jennings Bryan. Robert and Ruth Meeker had one son, cinematographer and director, Robert \"Robin\" Owen Lehman Jr. Meeker had three daughters from her first marriage to William Painter Meeker (1902–1983) whom she divorced in 1933: Ruth Meeker, Helen Meeker, and Kathrine Meeker. Robert and Ruth Meeker's marriage also ended in divorce in 1951.\n\nRobert's third marriage—to Lee \"Elena\" (Anz) Lynn (1919-2006)—occurred on July 10, 1952 in New York.\n\nHe died August 9, 1969 and is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.\n\n"}

There he developed and sold an add-on memory board for the Apple II computer. Later, Creative began creating customized PCs adapted for the Chinese language, including enhanced audio capabilities that allowed the devices to produce speech and melodies. The success of this audio interface led to the development of the stand-alone sound card Sound Blaster. It was among the first dedicated audio processing cards widely available to general consumers. Creative dominated the PC audio market until the 2000s, when OEM PCs began to be built with integrated sound boards in the motherboard. Sound Blaster then found itself reduced to a niche product.\n\nSim Wong Hoo has won accolades from industry and government for his innovations.

{"id": "2751096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2751096", "title": "Unstructured data", "text": "Unstructured data\n\nUnstructured data (or unstructured information) is information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in fielded form in databases or annotated (semantically tagged) in documents.\n\nIn 1998, Merrill Lynch cited a rule of thumb that somewhere around 80-90% of all potentially usable business information may originate in unstructured form. This rule of thumb is not based on primary or any quantitative research, but nonetheless is accepted by some. Other sources have reported similar or higher percentages of unstructured data.\n\nIDC and EMC project that data will grow to 40 zettabytes by 2020, resulting in a 50-fold growth from the beginning of 2010. More recently, IDC and Seagate predict that the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes by 2025 and majority of that will be unstructured.The Computer World magazine states that unstructured information might account for more than 70%–80% of all data in organizations.\n\nThe earliest research into business intelligence focused in on unstructured textual data, rather than numerical data. As early as 1958, computer science researchers like H.P. Luhn were particularly concerned with the extraction and classification of unstructured text. However, only since the turn of the century has the technology caught up with the research interest. In 2004, the SAS Institute developed the SAS Text Miner, which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce a hyper-dimensional textual space into smaller dimensions for significantly more efficient machine-analysis. The mathematical and technological advances sparked by machine textual analysis prompted a number of businesses to research applications, leading to the development of fields like sentiment analysis, voice of the customer mining, and call center optimization. The emergence of Big Data in the late 2000s led to a heightened interest in the applications of unstructured data analytics in contemporary fields such as predictive analytics and root cause analysis.\n\nThe term is imprecise for several reasons:\n\nTechniques such as data mining, natural language processing (NLP), and text analytics provide different methods to find patterns in, or otherwise interpret, this information. Common techniques for structuring text usually involve manual tagging with metadata or part-of-speech tagging for further text mining-based structuring. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) standard provided a common framework for processing this information to extract meaning and create structured data about the information.\n\nSoftware that creates machine-processable structure can utilize the linguistic, auditory, and visual structure that exist in all forms of human communication. Algorithms can infer this inherent structure from text, for instance, by examining word morphology, sentence syntax, and other small- and large-scale patterns. Unstructured information can then be enriched and tagged to address ambiguities and relevancy-based techniques then used to facilitate search and discovery. Examples of \"unstructured data\" may include books, journals, documents, metadata, health records, audio, video, analog data, images, files, and unstructured text such as the body of an e-mail message, Web page, or word-processor document. While the main content being conveyed does not have a defined structure, it generally comes packaged in objects (e.g. in files or documents, …) that themselves have structure and are thus a mix of structured and unstructured data, but collectively this is still referred to as \"unstructured data\". For example, an HTML web page is tagged, but HTML mark-up typically serves solely for rendering. It does not capture the meaning or function of tagged elements in ways that support automated processing of the information content of the page. XHTML tagging does allow machine processing of elements, although it typically does not capture or convey the semantic meaning of tagged terms.\n\nSince unstructured data commonly occurs in electronic documents, the use of a content or document management system which can categorize entire documents is often preferred over data transfer and manipulation from within the documents. Document management thus provides the means to convey structure onto document collections.\n\nSearch engines have become popular tools for indexing and searching through such data, especially text.\n\nSpecific computational workflows have been developed to impose structure upon the unstructured data contained within text documents. These workflows are generally designed to handle sets of thousands or even millions of documents, or far more than manual approaches to annotation may permit. Several of these approaches are based upon the concept of online analytical processing, or OLAP, and may be supported by data models such as text cubes. Once document metadata is available through a data model, generating summaries of subsets of documents (i.e., cells within a text cube) may be performed with phrase-based approaches.\n\nBiomedical research generates one major source of unstructured data as researchers often publish their findings in scholarly journals. Though the language in these documents is challenging to derive structural elements from (e.g., due to the complicated technical vocabulary contained within and the domain knowledge required to fully contextualize observations), the results of these activities may yield links between technical and medical studies and clues regarding new disease therapies. Recent efforts to enforce structure upon biomedical documents include self-organizing map approaches for identifying topics among documents, general-purpose unsupervised algorithms, and an application of the CaseOLAP workflow to determine associations between protein names and cardiovascular disease topics in the literature. CaseOLAP defines phrase-category relationships in an accurate (identifies relationships), consistent (highly reproducible), and efficient manner. This platform offers enhanced accessibility and empowers the biomedical community with phrase-mining tools for widespread biomedical research applications.\n\n\n\n"}
