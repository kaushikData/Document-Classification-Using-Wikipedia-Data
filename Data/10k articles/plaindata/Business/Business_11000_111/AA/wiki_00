Meyerhoff (1895–1986) was an advertising agency executive and entrepreneur. He was born in Chicago, Illinois.\nMeyerhoff founded his own agency, Arthur Meyerhoff Associates, in 1932 after persuading the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company that he could arrange for newspapers to place advertisements for Wrigley chewing gum on their comic pages. He then got the newspapers to agree to the idea.\n\nDuring World War II, Philip K. Wrigley was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club. Wrigley decided to found the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players. He approached other Major League team owners, but the idea was not well received. Then, four non-Major League cities were selected that were in close proximity to the AAGPBL headquarters in Chicago and close to each other: Rockford of Illinois, South Bend of Indiana and Racine and Kenosha of Wisconsin. Meyerhoff was given the responsibility of coordinating operations with city officials and civic leaders in the communities, as well as a projected budget was developed. In 1943 the league made an auspicious debut, but after the 1944 season Wrigley sold the AAGPBL to Meyerhoff.\n\nIt was under Meyerhoff management that expansion to six teams, as well as the publicity campaign of the AAGPBL reached its peak. He re-organized the league so that each franchise would be governed through a League Board of Directors with representatives from each franchise. Each club now had a voice in the adoption of rules and regulations and the direction of the sport. All assets were turned over to the new directors and Wrigley was no longer involved with the league. The AAGPBL excelled in attendance and performing during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans.\n\nMeyerhoff also organized several companies outside his advertising agency to develop new products. One company he owned developed \"PAM\", a substitute for fats or oils that can be sprayed on pots and pans. In the mid-1950s, when Meyerhoff was looking for a side business, he advertised for ideas and heard from two chemists who had developed something like a cooking spray. First, Meyerhoff had the formula perfected so it could be sprayed; then he campaigned for grocers to shelve \"PAM\" in the baking aisle with the flours, not the aerosol section next to insecticides and hair spray. The name PAM is an initialism for \"Product of Arthur Meyerhoff.\"\n\nIn the 1960s Meyerhoff wrote his book \"The Strategy of Persuasion\", which reflects his point of views that the United States Information Agency should get out of the news business and into the business of selling democracy abroad. He sold his agency in 1979. \nMeyerhoff died on August 29, 1986 at his home in Rancho Santa Fe, California, at the age of 91.\n"}

{"id": "37179317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37179317", "title": "Business Intelligence Markup Language", "text": "Business Intelligence Markup Language\n\nBusiness Intelligence Markup Language (Biml) is a domain-specific XML dialect for defining business intelligence (BI) assets. Biml authored BI assets can currently be used by the BIDS Helper add-on for Microsoft SQL Server Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) and the Varigence Mist (now called BimlStudio) integrated development environment; both tools translate Biml metadata into SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) assets for the Microsoft SQL Server platform. However, emitters can be created to compile Biml for any desired BI platform.\n\nWhile Biml’s declarative design is sufficient to author BI assets, BimlScript extends the language by enabling authors to embed C# or VB.NET code within Biml, similar to how ASP.NET includes .NET code within static HTML markup. BimlScript is used to merge changes into existing Biml assets, automatically generate Biml code, and apply changes across multiple Biml files during compilation.\n\nBiml is an XML dialect that specifies all aspects of a BI solution, including relational models, data transformation packages, multi-dimensional models, and tabular models.\n\nUnlike other BI solutions, Biml has a \"write once, target any platform\" philosophy. This enables Biml users to switch their target platform without needing to change their code. Currently, Biml targets SQL Server versions 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012 and 2014, emitting SSIS packages and SSAS cubes.\n\nBecause Biml is XML, it can leverage the vast ecosystem of tools for XML based languages. This also makes it human readable/writeable, so it is easier to edit by hand than the SSIS/SSAS files it generates.\n\nIn late 2009, Biml was extended with BimlScript. BimlScript allows C# or VB.NET code nuggets to be embedded directly within Biml. BimlScript's goal is to automate repetitive work in reusable scripts. Additionally, it's been used to automate package generation and build reusable patterns for BI tasks. BimlScript is also used to take metadata from various sources (relational database structure, relational data, flat files, annotations, etc...) and automatically generate Biml code from it.\n\nMist is an IDE for authoring Biml code and building BI assets. Mist leverages visual design capabilities and debugging features to simultaneously edit entire business intelligence models, including relational tables, SSIS packages, and cubes. Mist also incorporates modern programming IDE features, including text editors with syntax highlighting, Intelliprompt and quick-info displays, source control integration, and multi-monitor support.\n\nAs Biml’s popularity has grown, key portions of the Biml engine, including dynamic package generation, have been contributed to the BIDS Helper open source project hosted on CodePlex.\n\nBimlScript.com is a community website for developing and sharing Biml solutions to BI problems, and contributing Biml content to share with others. Along with tutorials, walkthroughs, and videos, the site provides an online Biml editor.\n\nBiml files are compiled to produce BI assets for a chosen platform. Currently, it’s possible to generate assets for Microsoft’s SSIS, SSAS, and SQL Server platforms, for the 2005, 2008 (R2), 2012 and 2014 releases. Other platforms may be targeted in the future.\n\nBiml has a syntax that’s common to all XML languages. Tags begin and end with < and >, respectively. Furthermore, tags can have attributes and nested elements.\n\nBiml documents begin with a common declaration\nBiml has a well-defined set of root types, indicating the various kinds of BI assets that can be created\n\n\nThis is an example of the AdventureWorks DimCurrency table, authored in Biml\n\nAll BimlScript tags begin and end with <# and #> delimiters, respectively. Special types of BimlScript tags use augmented versions of these delimiters, to indicate specific usages.\n\nA Biml file, with BimlScript, begins with at least one directive. Directives provide instructions to the Biml engine, regarding how to process the BimlScript and generate its Biml. Directives are single tags that begin with <#@. Each directive begins with a single term, followed by attributes that supply required values.\n\nThe two most common directives are template and import.\n\nThis directive indicates that the file's BimlScript uses the C# programming language.\nThis directive specifies .NET namespaces that should be imported for the file. It is functionally equivalent to the C# using statement or VB.NET Imports statement.\nWhen authoring BimlScript, additional delimiters may be used. These delimiters match the behavior of T4 template delimiters.\n\nThis BimlScript example imports a database's assets via a connection, declared in a separate file, named \"AdventureWorksLT\". Each schema and table from the imported database is then embedded directly within the Schemas and Tables collections, respectively.\nThis example shows how developers can use Biml and BimlScript to:\n\n"}

This concept includes the following key elements: \n\nTypical disasters that business continuity covers include fires, floods, accidents caused by key people, server crashes or virus infections, insolvency of key suppliers, negative media campaigns and market upheavals (ex. stock market crashes). The locations of these disasters and the company real estates may be independent.\n\nThe management of business continuity falls largely within the sphere of quality management and risk management, with some cross-over into related fields such as governance, information security and compliance. Risk management is an important tool for business continuity as it provides a structured way to identify the sources of business disruption and assess their probability and harm. It is expected that all business functions, operations, supplies, systems, relationships, etc. that are critically important to achieve the organization's operational objectives are analyzed and included in the business continuity plan. Business Impact Analysis is the generally accepted risk management term for the process of determining the relative importance or criticality of those elements, and in turn drives the priorities, planning, preparations and other business continuity management activities.\n\nIf there is no business continuity plan implemented and the organization in question is facing a rather severe threat or disruption that may lead to bankruptcy, the implementation and outcome, if not too late, may strengthen the organization's survival and its continuity of business activities.\n\nOne important way to achieve business continuity is the use of international standards, program development, and supporting policies. These standards ensure that proven methods and concepts for business continuity are used. As with many quality management standards though, the primary task of identifying relevant potential disasters, making plans for evacuation, buying spare machines and servers, performing backups and bringing them off-site, assigning responsibility, performing drills, educating employees and being vigilant cannot be replaced by adherence to standards. As such, commitment by management to see business continuity as an important topic and assign people to work on it, remains the most important step in establishing business continuity.\n\nSeveral business continuity standards have been published by various standards bodies:\n\n\nOngoing management-level process to ensure that necessary steps are regularly taken to identify probable accidents, disasters, emergencies, and/or threats. It also involves (1) assessment of the probable effect of such events, (2) development of recovery strategies and plans, and (3) maintenance of their readiness through personnel training and plan testing. See also business impact analysis\n\nPolicies are those things mandated by the management of an organization that will always be performed according to a preset design plan, and supporting all business functions within an organization.\n\nThe entire concept of business continuity is based on the identification of all business functions within an organization, and then assigning a level of importance to each business function. A business impact analysis is the primary tool for gathering this information and assigning criticality, recovery point objectives, and recovery time objectives, and is therefore part of the basic foundation of business continuity.\n\nThe BIA can be used to identify extent and timescale of the impact on different levels of an organization. For instance it can examine the effect of disruption on operational, functional and strategic activities of an organization.\nNot only the current activities but the effect of disruption on major business changes, introducing new product or services for example, can be determined by BIA.\n\nMost standards require that a business impact analysis should be reviewed at defined intervals appropriate for each organization and whenever any of the following occur:\n\nIn large information technology environments, personnel turnover is inevitable and must be planned as part of business continuity. The solution to the problems associated with turnover, is complete and up-to- date documentation. This ensures that new personnel will have the information they need to quickly become knowledgeable and productive with respect to the business functions they are tasked to support. This also implies that business function related documentation is largely generated (rather than written) from existing systems and managed in an automated manner.\n\nRegulations require that changes to business functions be documented and tracked for auditing purposes and is designated as \"change control\". This brings a level of stability to the business functions by requiring the support personnel to document and coordinate proposed changes to the underlying systems. As this process becomes more and more automated, the emphasis will be less upon personnel control, and more upon regulatory compliance.\n\nOne of the most costly and time-consuming aspects of information technology management is dealing with auditors. One of the goals of business continuity is data center automation, which includes audit management. All modern business functions should be designed with the concept of automatically generating the requisite audit compliance information and documentation as part of conducting day-to-day business. This dramatically reduces the time and cost associated with manually producing this information.\n\nThe interface between management and information technology is the Service level agreement (SLA). This provides a written contract stipulating the expectations of management with regard to the availability of a necessary business function, and the deliverables that information technology provides in support of that business function.\n\nAnother component of business continuity is communications in times of duress. Members of the disaster recovery team must be able to communicate effectively among themselves as well as with managers, directors, customers, partners, and even with the media. In order to avoid some of the potential problems associated with disrupted communication channels, the business continuity plan should include a lead manager who will be in charge of all communications in that area, the cooperation of executives and public relations people, and scheduled exercises to put the plan into practice.\n\nThe following is a list of logical entities within an information technology environment which aid business continuity:\n\nPlanning, prevention, and preparation are a key part of any business continuity management system and have direct read across from civil contingencies planning. The activity begins with understanding the business to identify potential risks and threats to critical business activities both internally and from the external environment. It is also advisable to examine the resilience of suppliers.\n\nThe components of the business continuity methodology required for manifestation into a documented plan include:\n\nSet of documents, instructions, and procedures which enable a business to respond to accidents, disasters, emergencies, and/or threats without any stoppage or hindrance in its key operations. Also called business resumption plan, disaster recovery plan, or recovery plan.\n\nShould also include: purpose, scope, objectives and assumptions that were used to develop the plan. Key accountabilities including authority to invoke, instructions subsequent to invocations, and a detailed communications plan must be included in the plan to ensure efficient resumption of operations.\n\nTask of identifying, developing, acquiring, documenting, and testing procedures and resources that will ensure continuity of a firm's key operations in the event of an accident, disaster, emergency, and/or threat. It involves (1) risk mitigation planning (reducing possibility of the occurrence of adverse events), and (2) business recovery planning (ensuring continued operation in the aftermath of a disaster).\n\nGuidelines are those things which are recommended to be performed according to a preset design plan. However depending upon the needs and requirements of the target business function, these items may or may not be performed, or may be altered during implementation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2379425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2379425", "title": "Capitalism (video game)", "text": "Capitalism (video game)\n\nCapitalism is a business simulation video game first published in 1995 by Interactive Magic, developed by Enlight for the Macintosh and MS-DOS and designed by Trevor Chan. Other similar business simulation games include \"Industry Giant, Entrepreneur\" and \"The Corporate Machine.\" \"Capitalism\" may be the first successful business simulation game.\n\nThe aim of \"Capitalism\" is to become the most profitable business in the world while competing in several different markets against a number of different corporations. The player must run a business as the chief executive officer while preventing the business from going bankrupt or being bought out by a competitor.\n\nA more advanced version was developed and released as \"Capitalism Plus\" on January 1, 1996, featuring world maps, more products and enhanced management capabilities which was published by Brøderbund. A sequel was released entitled \"Capitalism II\" in 2001. An expanded version of \"Capitalism II\", called \"Capitalism Lab\", was released December 14, 2012.\n\n\"Capitalism\" is a simulation game which can be played in two different ways. The player may start their own business or play a scenario with a pre-made business with a set goal. In a new game, the player begins with a maximum of $200,000,000 initial capital. Each store can be stocked with up to four different items. As a real world model it is necessary to take into account land cost, overhead, demand for the products, and competition. The player can build several types of firms including department stores, factories, research and development centers, farms, mines, oil wells, and logging camps.\n\nThe most common business model to pursue in \"Capitalism\" is retail by running a chain of department stores. However, the player can venture into any market segment they want including manufacturing, which includes another set of considerations such as suppliers and raw material shortages. Manufacturing begins with building a factory and planning the internal operation layout of the structure. Purchasing, manufacturing, sales and advertising can all be used in factories.\n\nThe player can also choose to run research and development (R&D) operations as either their sole business or alongside running other operations such as department stores and factories. R&D ultimately improves the player's product quality by increasing \"technology gain\". R&D for any product can last from 6 months to 10 years in the game, with the technology gain being higher when the R&D duration is increased. New products can also be produced using R&D.\n\n\"Capitalism\" includes seventeen scenarios with pre-made situations and businesses and a certain goal. The scenarios are generally more difficult to succeed in that competitors often have the starting advantage. Each scenario has a different goal and different environment and competitor situation. For example, the \"Alternative Challenge\" scenario restricts the market to two cities while in \"\"D\" for Diversification\" the player must manage a profitable broad-based corporation and manage a large number of firms at the same time.\n\nSome of the scenarios require the player to dominate a particular market in terms of market share. For example, \"Food Dominance\" sets a goal of dominating the food industry within 50 years while earning an annual operating profit of no less than $20 million. In \"Fortress of the Beverage King\", the player must dethrone the Beverage King 'James Zandman' as the dominator of the beverage industry within 50 years.\n\nMost scenario games disable the stock market option in an attempt to make the player focus on completing the scenario goals. The initial capital given in each scenario depends on the difficulty of the goals set. Each time a player successfully completes a scenario within the time limit set and with all goals reached, they will receive a bonus score and be added to the 'Hall of Fame' list.\n\n\"Capitalism\" includes many different features designed to reduce effort and save time in basic gameplay. From the main menu, players can use 'Quick Start' to choose from eight instructional games to learn about retailing, market analysis, farming, manufacturing, branding and advertising, research and development, raw material production and the stock market. These lessons are included in the game to introduce a new player to the concepts and basic gameplay.\n\nAnother feature of \"Capitalism\" is the layout plan library, which can store layout plans for all types of buildings available in the game. It enables the player to save previously used layout plans into a library as a record and then apply them to buildings to save time rather than creating new layout plans. Layout plans can be replaced, added, deleted or sorted.\n\nA more advanced version of the original \"Capitalism\" was developed and released as \"Capitalism Plus\" on Jan 1, 1996 and published by Brøderbund for Windows 95 only. It added world maps, more products and enhanced management capabilities to the game in addition to improved SVGA graphics, more markets to dominate and random events including riots, disease and technology breakthroughs. With \"Capitalism Plus\", a map and scenario editor program was also added enabling players to configure products, industries, goals and other items. Capitalism Plus is compatible with Windows XP and Windows Vista.\n\n\"Capitalism\" and its \"Capitalism Plus\" SKU together sold 150,000 copies by 2000.\n\nShortly after the release of \"Capitalism\" in 1995, a review in \"Next Generation\" commented, \"The game is complex, but don't let the novel-sized manual fool you. It may be daunting at first, but this is one of those sims that you'll play for hours without even noticing.\" The reviewer scored it four out of five stars. \"Capitalism\" also made appearances on The Discovery Channel, and CNBC-TV Cable.\n\nIn 1996, Harvard University and Stanford University began using \"Capitalism\" for educational purposes. Professor Tom Kosnik said, \"Capitalism is a world-class, hands-on learning experience I've used at Stanford School of Engineering and Harvard Business School. Gamers not only learn the subtleties of growing an entrepreneurial business but also learn about leadership and team building necessary in any business situation.\" \n\nOn October 21, 1996, \"BusinessWeek\" reviewed \"Capitalism\", saying:\nIn 2000, \"Computer Gaming World\" named \"Capitalism\" among the fifteen most difficult games ever, saying: \"[\"Capitalism\" is] so complicated it should come with a free MBA in every box.\" The magazine has also praised the game as highly enjoyable and addictive.\n\n\"PC Gamer\" nominated \"Capitalism\" as the best simulation of 1995, although it lost to \"Apache\".\n\n\n"}

At the close of the war, he returned to Philadelphia to practice law.\n\nIn May 1861, following the outbreak of the American Civil War and President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms, he was appointed a Lieutenant Colonel in the Pennsylvania Reserves, rising in May to the rank of Colonel in command of the 42nd Pennsylvania Volunteers Infantry (13th Reserves), also known as the 1st Pennsylvania Rifles. In October of that year he was elected to the Thirty-seventh United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Edward J. Morris. He was tendered a commission as a brigadier general, but declined it, and then resigned from the army in February 1862.\n\nAfter the war, he became one of the proprietors and editor-in-chief of the \"Philadelphia Age\", and retained that position for the remainder of his life. His literary work was confined mainly to editorial contributions to the columns of this journal. His only separate publication was \"The Case of Major André\", a carefully prepared essay read before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, which vindicated the action of George Washington. The immediate occasion was a passage in Lord Mahon's \"History of England\" that denounced the execution of André as the greatest blot upon Washington's record. By an authority so high as the \"London Critic\", this essay was subsequently pronounced a fair refutation of Lord Mahon's charge.\n\n\n"}

A University of Western Ontario graduate and Advisory Board member, Cohon is also known for his work in the early 2000s in international development and London community building and for the last decade deeply involved in the nighttime entertainment business in Moscow and recently in London.\n\nCohon was born at Michael Reese Hospital in the South Side of Chicago, the eldest of two children of Susan Silver Cohon (Born 1938), a philanthropist and George Cohon (Born 1937), a former lawyer and Founder of McDonald's in Canada and Russia. His grandparents on both sides emigrated from Ukraine, Russia, Lithuania and Latvia.\n\nCohon moved with his parents and younger brother Mark to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1968 when he was five years old. He attended Upper Canada College where he excelled in rugby and also took up the saxophone which he plays to this day. Cohon went on to graduate from the economics and music faculty from The University of Western Ontario where he was heavily involved in student politics, was the Business Editor of the University newspaper, worked at the campus radio station and started a TV station on campus - playing in a band, throughout. Cohon also created the first Annual Western Charity Ball (1984) with Alan Thicke that continues to this day, raising millions of dollars for local London and Canadian charities.\n\nCohon got the travel bug in 1985 and has worked and traveled to 97 countries but calls London home and has lived there since 1999. As well as spending 15 years in Canada, Cohon has also spent 12 in the USA, five years in Russia, two years in Sweden, two years in Norway and three months each in India, South Africa, Chile and Venezuela.\n\nPost university, Cohon became one of the first Canadian venturers for the UK charity Operation Raleigh and participated in Operation 5C in 1985 to Southern Chile. He helped to build a school in Puerto Montt and completed a road survey on horseback for the extension of the Pan American Highway (which has now been built).\n\nHe came out of the jungle in May 1986, saw a Coca-Cola sign on a hut and went on to work for the company for 14 years. Cohon quickly grew through the ranks within Coca-Cola USA from 1986-1991. He was given the Miami territory and he started selling Coca-Cola to mom and pop restaurants from a banana-coloured station wagon and after two years had become one of the top salesmen in the country. Cohon was soon promoted to the company's headquarters in Atlanta and went on to train hundreds of Coca-Cola salespeople across the United States.\n\nTwo months after the opening of the Soviet Union's first McDonald's restaurant in Moscow in early 1991, his future mentor Donald Keough, President and CEO of the Coca-Cola Company worldwide, appointed Cohon as the company's first employee in the Soviet Union. He spent six months living in the communist party hotel Octoberskya 2 in Moscow where he learned to speak fluent Russian, worked at the local Soviet beverage factory, rode trucks, and traveled to every metro station in the city, convincing the leadership of Coca-Cola to invest in Russia. From age 27 to 31 he launched the brand to the Russians and led the construction of Coca-Cola's first factory in the former Soviet Union. Cohon and his friends and family were hosted by President Gorbachev at his 30th birthday party. He was often followed by the KGB and went public on Russian radio with tapes after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Just prior to the first Soviet Coca-Cola plant opening, a rocket-propelled hand grenade was launched at his office early one morning in October 1993, luckily causing little damage.\n\nCohon was eventually promoted to European Division Marketing Director and moved to Oslo, running the marketing for 15 countries in Northern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He then moved to Atlanta for four years where he was responsible for Brand Coca-Cola worldwide, including its activation at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games.\n\nAfter his extended tenure, he chose to jump off the traditional corporate career path and spend three years as Director of Learning Strategy for the Coca-Cola European Group. His personal coach was Peter Senge, famous author of The Fifth Discipline. He helped the senior Coca-Cola European leadership team create shared vision around the changing beverage landscape and started to move the organisation to a more responsible corporate agenda.\n\nCohon moved to London in 1999 and was promoted to be Deputy Division President of The Northwest Europe Division.\n\nCohon was nominated to the Class of 1999 Global Leaders for Tomorrow at the World Economic Forum. It was in the midst of the anti-globalisation movement and after attending Davos and hearing former American President Clinton speak about the need to evolve capitalism to make it more equitable for all, he decided to leave The Coca-Cola Company and left a substantial amount of stock options on the table to pursue a more purposeful life and career.\n\nHe went on to work for Klaus Schwab, Founder of the World Economic Forum for six months, deeply engaging in the world of international organisations, understanding the world of Global NGOs and pushing the corporate social responsibility agenda. Perceiving the challenge of making a personal impact on global issues, in 2001 he founded Globalegacy and focused his efforts on making an impact in London's urban communities.\n\nAfter teaching at the London Business School for a summer, he hired 10 students and began to craft a vision for Globalegacy. Cohon focused his efforts on East London and quickly moved into an office container near Bromley-By-Bow. He worked closely with local government authorities the LDA, Bromley-by-Bow Centre and Leaside Regeneration to begin to craft a local development strategy that worked for all prior to the awarding of the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nCohon then decided to take his expertise back internationally. He teamed up with world-renowned city development expert Jeb Brugmann and global business guru, CK Prahalad, author of \"Fortune at The Bottom of the Pyramid\" to own and lead an international development strategic advisory firm. Together they helped create and support two thriving businesses for people in poverty. One started with BP, now called First Energy, is a leading provider of clean energy stoves for businesses and kitchens throughout India. The other, RML, was an early stage tech company incubated with Reuters that went on to become an award-winning technology company providing Agri Decision Support Solution for farmers throughout India.\n\nIn 1993, Cohon received an Honorary Doctorate of Economics from Moscow International University. In 2000, the World Economic Forum named him \"A Global Leader for Tomorrow.\" He was awarded the 2003 Young Alumni Award from the University of Western Ontario and now sits on their Global Advisory Board. Cohon is an active supporter of London's soon-to-be-built Garden Bridge project. As well, he gives time to many local charities in London. \nCohon was one of the first sponsors of London's Ethical Fashion Forum's RE Fashion in 2008.\n\nHe is also Chairman of Worn Again since 2007, a technology innovation company in development of a circular textile to textile recycling technology and working closely with H & M.\n\nCohon decided to combine his international business experience and his love of Russia to delve into another business: entertainment. Partnering with Guy Laliberte, owner of the world's largest live entertainment company, Cohon brought Cirque du Soleil to Russia, acting as Vice Chairman of Cirque du Soleil Russia. Since 2009 he has helped transform the live entertainment business across the country, bringing 11 highly acclaimed international shows to 14 Russian cities which have been seen by 2.3 million people. Cohon spearheaded over 120 million USD investment into the sector and has worked with 40 local Russian and International partners. He also led the implementation of Russia's first electronic ticketing system that provides security, best pricing and freedom of choice to millions of Russians. Cohon's Russian partner is currently finalising plans to build a $50 million USD theatre to house future Cirque du Soleil shows in Moscow.\n\nThroughout this time, Cohon has built a close global network of artists, directors, producers, musicians, stage designers and actors. He has been very engaged in the emerging immersive theatre segment in London and Moscow and continues to actively support the development of these new underground concepts to expand entertainment and nightlife.\n\nCohon lives on a barge called Ocean on the River Thames with his teenage son and daughter. Cohon was divorced in 2010 from Dr. Jeanette Sundberg-Cohon after an 18-year relationship.\n\nCohon is an avid international traveller. He does not own a car and travels throughout London by foot, boat, bike and public transport.\n"}

The position works closely with a chief financial officer (CFO) or treasurer. A Director of Development is chiefly responsible for bringing in revenue streams to a non-profit (grants, donations, special events), and a CFO is responsible for the fiscal management of the organization. A CFO is rarely assigned to write grant narratives, but may oversee the budget section of a grant application or a fiscal report for a grant. Some larger organizations (especially those that have large government grants) have a grants manager as well as a grant writer/Director of Development. A Grants Manager assists the CFO with grant reports and/or grant related accounting. A development director is usually remunerated for his or her work, and in best practices for nonprofit organizations, development directors earn salaries. Commissions are still considered unethical by professional organizations such as the Grant Professionals Association (GPA) and the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), but the practice of commission based remuneration is growing, particularly in the current economy.\n\nThe role of a development director is to develop and implement a strategic plan to raise vital funds for their organization in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.The development director's primary responsibility, however, is to oversee fundraising, rather than to actually raise money. This person may write grants, research foundations and corporations, and oversee or implement other fundraising strategies, but she or he works mostly behind the scenes, establishing a structure for effective fundraising. The development director may also be responsible for additional financial responsibilities, including developing business plans or strategic plans in collaboration with the board for the future of the organization. The development director is usually accountable to the Executive Director, Chief Operating Officer, or CFO. The board often offers suggestions and ideas about how to increase the fundraising, including contacts, and the development director chooses how to implement these ideas to maximize inflow while keeping outflow at a minimum and keeping donors happy. A strong board often has a development/fundraising committee, makes personal donations to the non-profit, and assists with annual campaigns.\n\nThe development director has an outreach role in the organization and often fulfills a public affairs role in addition to office-based work. Development directors motivate and satisfy donors, board members, staff and even the press. Many Directors of Development assist with communications such a non-profits annual report, development and communications section of website, newsletters, and donor databases.\n\nThe structure of a Development Department varies greatly. A Director of Development may or may not have staff reporting to him/her, depending on the size of the organization. Some large non-profits have a development team including a Grant Writer, donor database specialist, Grants Manager, Special Events Coordinator, Communications staff, and Planning Giving staff. In some cases, an Executive Director serves as the lead grant writer of an organization. Some non-profits hire development staff on a part-time or consultant basis, instead of full-time.\n\nMedian pay for Development Directors in the U.S. is in the neighborhood of $62,000 annually. Total cash compensation ranges from $40,000 to $100,000; the final number includes potential for approximately $10,000 each from bonuses and profit sharing in exceptional cases. While geography and years of experience impact pay for this group, the organization is the most influential factor. Earnings for this group are mostly affected by the particular organization, followed by the particular city and tenure.\n\nAs the title suggests, the development director is concerned with the growth of the organization. This includes staff, membership, budget, company assets, and all other company resources, to help make the best use of them and maximize the organization's profitability and profile.\n\n\nhttp://www.raise-funds.com/1999/a-development-director-needs-more-than-a-smile-and-a-shoeshine-but-its-a-good-start/\n"}

Created by Doris Duke herself, the aerial view confirms they were larger than the New York Botanical Garden's Haupt Conservatory, and were open to the public from 1964. They were closed by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation on or before May 25, 2008 and dismantled.\n\nDuke Gardens were part of the Duke Farms estate built by James Buchanan Duke, founder of the American Tobacco Company and benefactor of Duke University. Duke Farms is located on U.S. Route 206, south of the Somerville Circle, in Hillsborough Township in Somerset County, New Jersey, United States. The Gardens were designed and installed by Doris Duke herself, therefore several alternative names are used: The Doris Duke Indoor Display Gardens at Duke Farms, Duke Farms Indoor Display Gardens, The Doris Duke International Display Gardens, The Duke Gardens Foundation. Officially, the Gardens were The Duke Gardens Foundation, Inc, a 501(c)(3) Private Operating Foundation established 1960.\n\nMiss Duke developed these exotic display gardens in honor of her beloved father James Buchanan Duke, Inspired by DuPont's Longwood Gardens, each of the eleven Duke Display Gardens is a full-scale re-creation of a garden theme, country or period. Display construction began in 1958. Miss Duke both designed the displays and labored on their installation, sometimes working 16-hour days. In 1960 she donated of her estate, including the greenhouses, to the Duke Gardens Foundation, Inc.\n\nThe Duke Farms website stated that \"Doris Duke had long been personally involved in the construction, repair and remodeling of her properties, and she was directly involved in the physical design of the Indoor Display Gardens. Although she lacked specific botanical knowledge, she had a clear vision of the spaces and features she wanted to create. According to the New York Post, she designed all but one of the gardens, incorporating her interests in color, design and fragrance.\" (Following the closure, this text is no longer present on the website ).\n\nDoris Duke continued her involvement with her gardens throughout her life, bringing designers with her to modify them during the summer season when they were closed to tourists. In the 1970s she added extensive night-lighting, and introduced public tours of the gardens at night. A rediscovered image of the \"stunning nightlighting of the French Gardens\" was used as one centerpiece of social protest against the closure.\n\nDuke Gardens formed four sides of a quadrangle, and took at least one hour to view. The entry fell on the side formed by a Conservatory designed by Horace Trumbauer and constructed 1909-17. The other three sides were formed by greenhouses in styles that are still manufactured. The greenhouse over the English Garden was installed in the 1990s.\n\nDuke Gardens were visited in the following sequence:\n\n\nIn March 2008 Duke Farms announced \"an expansive and bold new vision for the property, in which it will refocus its programs and operations to become an environmental showcase and learning center. The first major change will be the conclusion in May 2008 of tours of the 11 indoor display gardens\".\n\nAlthough the Duke Farms website states that \"The Indoor Display Gardens reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of Doris Duke, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding\", representatives of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (DDCF) more recently stated that the Gardens are \"perpetuating the Duke family history of personal passions and conspicuous consumption.\"\n\"The jewel-like gardens will remain open until May 25, after which they will be dismantled. According to DDCF sources, the day of the display gardens is past. They consume an inordinate share of financial and staff resources, they would require a very expensive modernization, and they no longer reflect the vision of Duke Farm’s future. A video record has been made for archival purposes.\"\n\nThe current garden tours are closing partly to use the building as a staging area for plants, while the other conservatory building is emptied and renovated, officials said. As for the plants there, [Executive Director Tim] Taylor said some may be used in the new gardens, though the concept will be different. \"It will not be replicated in terms of the gardens of the nations. We'll put a different spin on them, and come up with a logical connecting story of native horticulture to exotic horticulture,\" he said. Leftover plants will be donated to other botanical and display gardens, Taylor said. \"We're not destroying anything.\"\n\nIn April 2008, opposition to the closure and dismantling of the Display Gardens started to emerge. Open letters appeared in the local press. A website, www.SaveDukeGardens.org was established, allowing protest emails to the Trustees. A usergroup to display images of the Gardens, \"Save Duke Gardens\" was formed on the photography web service flickr.com . The ongoing web campaign has received local and metropolitan coverage, and resulted in hundreds of letters to the eleven DDCF Trustees behind the decision: Joan E. Spero, (President), Nannerl O. Keohane (Chair), John J. Mack (Vice Chair), Harry Demopoulos, Anthony Fauci, James F. Gill, Anne Hawley, Peter A. Nadosy, William H. Schlesinger, John H.T. Wilson and John E. Zuccotti.\n\nThe Duke Gardens Foundation, Inc, established in 1959 and now part of Duke Farms Foundation, must \"maintain a horticultural and botanical establishment for the purpose of scientific experimentation and public education and enjoyment\". With closure of Duke Gardens, the Duke Farms Foundation created new indoor and outdoor display gardens as part of Duke Farms. Indoor gardens are presented in the renovated Lord & Burnham conservatory (c.1900), now known as the Orchid Range . Duke Farms opened to the public on May 19, 2012.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50155350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50155350", "title": "Elizabeth H. Berger Plaza", "text": "Elizabeth H. Berger Plaza\n\nElizabeth H. Berger Plaza is a public park formed in the triangular junction of Trinity Place, Greenwich Street and Edgar Street. It faces the Manhattan approach to the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. Formerly known as the Edgar street Greenstreet, this park honors civic advocate Elizabeth H. Berger (1960-2013). In her role as president of the Downtown Alliance, she advocated for the fusion of two traffic triangles at this location into an expanded park. The park is located in a former neighborhood known as Little Syria, a bustling immigrant community displaced by the construction of the tunnel in 1953.\n\nAt the north side of this park is Edgar Street, reputedly the shortest street in Manhattan. Its gentle downward slope, also visible in the surrounding east/west streets, is the vestige of a ridge or bluff that ran parallel with the shoreline and crested at about Broadway, where Trinity Church is sited. It was a narrow street in its early days, no more than eighteen feet wide, called ‘Tuyn Paat’ or ‘Garden Alley’ in the Dutch period (1624 -1664). When the British took control of the colony in 1664, the street name was changed with characteristic indifference to Tin Pot Alley. \n\nThe City acquired the street in 1795, at which time its current name was affixed. Edgar likely refers to the family of William Edgar (1736-1820), a merchant from Detroit who came to New York circa 1780 and established a successful shipping business, with links to India and China. For a time, the street served as a thoroughfare or driveway leading to the Edgar family household located nearby. Until the western shoreline was filled in, this street ran to or very near the water’s edge.\n\nThe line of Greenwich Street was the approximate original coastline of Manhattan Island. In 1787, the Common Council, acted on a pre-war proposal to expand the shoreline sixty feet into the Hudson River. Then began the construction of Greenwich Street, which soon hosted a row of Federal-style townhouses. Washington Street followed in approximately 1808 and West Street by 1830. The drop in grade from Broadway to Greenwich Street abruptly evens out where the landfill begins. In October 2013, members of the Washington Street Historical Society, including Americans of Lebanese and Syrian descent, dedicated bench plaques inscribed with the names and quotes of individuals and groups that represent Arab-American culture. Edgar Street Plaza was renamed after Berger on December 16, 2013. With sculptural junipers along the benches, a small piazza surrounds a central planting area with oak leaf hydrangeas, viburnums and river birch trees, shielding park goers from traffic in an expanded green space.\n"}

Barstow\n\nGeorge Eames Barstow (1849–1924), described as a \"capitalist and irrigation pioneer,\" was a Texas land developer and a member of both the Providence, Rhode Island, common council (four years) and the city's school board (fourteen years), as well as the State Assembly from 1894 to 1896. He was known as \"the father of irrigation in the Southwest.\"\n\nBarstow began his business career at the age of seventeen and eventually \"founded, financed or organized\" five worsted and paper mills in Rhode Island.\n\nHe then turned his attention to the Pecos Valley in Texas, where the Pioneer Canal Company was chartered on September 30, 1889, with Barstow as treasurer. He later served as president of a successor company, the Pecos Valley Land and Irrigation Company.\n\nIn 1891 Barstow and other land developers formed a project to promote a town on the Texas and Pacific Railway in western Ward County, Texas. By 1895 the town had taken on the name of Barstow, and Barstow himself moved there from New York City in 1904. He took part in organizing other irrigation and drainage systems through the West.\n\nBarstow, a Republican, wrote pamphlets on varied subjects, including immigration, cooperatives, China-Japan relations and Americanism.\n\nIn 1908–09 Barstow was the president of the National Irrigation Congress, the leading organization interested in water projects in the West, and he was in charge of the annual convention in 1909 in Spokane, Washington. A \"Los Angeles Times\" reporter wrote about the impending congress that Barstow \"has been a prime mover in inducing the federal government to build the systems that will make fertile over 3,000,000 acres of land which once was a desert.\" In an interview, Barstow predicted that isolated farmhouses would become \"a thing of the past\" and that farmers would commute from their homes to farms via fast horses or automobiles or interurban streetcars. He added:\n\nThe government is laying out towns every five miles. . . . The farms will be small, ten to forty acres, and the farming intensive. Under these circumstances, the farmers will live in towns of 1500 to 2000 people, enjoying all the benefits of urban life — schools, churches and social life. . . . A tide from the city to the country has already set in. Many college graduates have chosen farming on irrigated tracts for their life work.\n\nIn his opening speech at the Spokane congress, Barstow urged the government to find work for (overseas) immigrants \"out West,\" to provide them with transportation and to lend them money to establish homes. He asked:\n\nShall I, who have always been broadly conservative, be regarded as preaching paternalism or as socialistic in my purpose when suggesting that the duty of the National Government may be found in providing under proper safeguard a fund which may be used to make loans of suitable amount to enable this thrifty and frugal class of people to locate their homes . . . ?\n\nBarstow was head of the National Immigration Commission in 1912, and he sent a message to the first convention of the American Immigration and Distribution League in New York City in April of that year \"stating that 65 per cent. of the immigrants who came to the country were farm laborers, and that the United States Government ought to establish an Immigrant Land Loan Fund, which would advance small sums to immigrants who settled on Western lands.\"\n\n\nBarstow was born on November 19, 1849, in Providence, the son of Amos Chafee, a manufacturer, banker and one of the most prominent men in the city, and Emeline (Mumford) Eames. Young George was educated at a public school and at Mowry and Goff's Classical School in that city. He was married to Clara Drew Symonds on October 19, 1871. They had nine children — Caroline Hartwell, George Eames Jr., Herbert Symonds, Helen Louise, Harold Carleton, Marguerite, Putnam, Donald and a ninth child, John P. or Paris (the sources differ). Barstow, who attended a Congregational church in Providence and a Methodist church in Texas, died on April 30, 1924, in Barstow and was buried in the Barstow Cemetery.\n"}

Topical areas within the interest of the group include: the foreign exchange market, international capital markets, international financial institutions, central banks and their supervision of financial services and markets, and macroeconomic issues such as product and labor markets.\n\nThe group is noted for its advocacy of changes in global clearing and settlement.\n\nThe Group of Thirty was founded in 1978 by Geoffrey Bell at the initiative of the Rockefeller Foundation, which also provided initial funding for the body. Its first chairman was Johannes Witteveen, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund. The G30's current Chairman is Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Its current Chairman of the Board of Trustees is Jacob Frenkel, and Paul Volcker is Chairman Emeritus.\n\nThe Bellagio Group, formed by Austrian economist Fritz Machlup, was the immediate predecessor to the Group of Thirty. It first met in 1963, to investigate international currency problems, particularly the balance of payments crisis which America faced throughout the early 1960s.\n\nIn June 2011, the group released a report that examines the most recent developments in the 2008 financial crisis, including the causes, the responses and the future outlook for the United States and other markets.\n\nIn January 2018, the European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly requested that ECB President Mario Draghi resign from the group because his membership in the organization could be interpreted as undue influence.\n\nThe group consists of thirty members and includes the heads of major private banks and central banks, as well as members from academia and international institutions. Current members of the group include current and former heads of the central banks of Argentina, Brazil, Great Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as two chairmen of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, two presidents of the European Central Bank, a chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, two chairmen of the Bank for International Settlements, two chief economists of the International Monetary Fund, a chief economist of the World Bank, and the former President of Mexico.

He would later be supervised by Colonel Ken Barnes, the father of English international footballer John Barnes. Burrell described Barnes as \"a great military leader\". It was Barnes who charged Burrell with looking after the JDF football team after Burrell shown Barnes a local newspaper headline \"Boy's Town drill soldiers\".

{"id": "5057750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5057750", "title": "Hotel Astor (New York City)", "text": "Hotel Astor (New York City)\n\nHotel Astor was a hotel located in the Times Square area of Manhattan, New York City, in operation from 1904 through 1967. The former site of the hotel, the block bounded by Broadway, Astor Plaza, West 44th Street, and West 45th Street, is now occupied by the high-rise 54-story office tower One Astor Plaza.\n\nWith its elaborately decorated public rooms and its roof garden, the Astor Hotel was perceived as the successor to the Astor family's Waldorf-Astoria on 34th Street. William C. Muschenheim and his brother, Frederick A. Muschenheim conceived plans for the grand hotel in 1900. The area was then known as Longacre Square and stood beyond the fringe of metropolitan life, the center of New York's carriage-building trade. The Muschenheim brothers became the proprietors for absentee landlord William Waldorf Astor, from whom they leased the land. The hotel opened on September 9, 1904.\n\nThe Hotel Astor was built in two stages, in 1905 and 1909–1910, by the same architects in the same style. Upon completion, the structure occupied an entire city block at a reported total cost of $7 million. Architects Clinton & Russell had designed a number of Astor commissions; here they developed a very Parisian \"Beaux Arts\" style completed with green-copper mansard roof. Its eleven stories contained 1000 guest rooms, with two more levels underground for its extensive \"backstage\" functions, such as the wine cellar.\n\nThe Astor was an important element in the growth of Times Square and its character as an entertainment center. In 1904, \"New York Times\" publisher Adolph S. Ochs moved his newspaper's operations to a new tower on 42nd Street in the middle of Longacre Square, and Ochs persuaded Mayor George B. McClellan, Jr. to build a subway station there and rename it Times Square. The Theater District would soon occupy magnificent new auditoriums along Forty-second Street, and electric lighting transformed this strip of Broadway into the \"Great White Way\".\n\nHotel Astor's success triggered the construction of the nearby Knickerbocker Hotel by other members of the Astor family two years later, although that property became commercial office space within a few years. The Astor set the pattern for \"a new species of popular hotels that soon clustered around Times Square, vast amusement palaces that catered to crowds with scenographic interiors that mirrored the theatricality of the Great White Way.\"\n\nWithin its restrained exterior, the Astor featured a long list of elaborately themed ballrooms and exotic restaurants: the Old New York lobby, the American Indian Grill Room decorated with artifacts collected with the help of the American Museum of Natural History, a Flemish smoking room, a Pompeiian billiard room, the Hunt Room decorated in sixteenth century German Renaissance style, and many other features.\n\nThe Large Ballroom (or Banquet Hall), on the ninth floor, opened with a dinner that was part of the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. Measuring , the Banquet Hall was decorated in the Rococo style of Louis XV and featured a high-groined arch ceiling in ivory white and old gold, supported by grouped caryatids. A gallery spanned the south and west sides, affording a fine view of the room, which could accommodate 500 diners.\n\nThe smaller ballroom, seating 250, was decorated in the neoclassical Louis XVI manner and could be joined with the larger ballroom. Still another adjoining room, \"The College Hall\", could also open to the ballroom so that the combined rooms could seat up 1,100 persons. The Palm Garden, or \"L'Orangerie\", located in the rear of the first floor lobby, was intended to represent an Italian garden. Its ceiling, painted to represent a Mediterranean sky, was partly concealed by feigned vine-covered pergolas. Blue lighting, hanging lamps draped in vines, swaying fern baskets, and scenic pictures of the out-of-doors further enhanced the perception.\n\nThe rooftop garden, with bandstand and observatory, was one of a number constructed in the city between 1880 and Prohibition, among them the American Theater on Eighth Avenue, the garden atop Stanford White's 1890 Madison Square Garden, and the Paradise Roof Garden opened by Oscar Hammerstein I in 1900. In later years, the noted landscape architect Takeo Shiota redesigned the roof's North Garden on a Japanese theme.\n\nArtwork in the original lobby included four murals by William de Leftwich Dodge depicting \"Ancient and Modern New York\", and a statue of the \"Three Graces\" by sculptor Isidore Konti, a likeness of the American model Audrey Munson.\n\nAs a popular meeting place and New York City landmark, the Astor had a place in popular culture for decades, from the extended double entendre song \"She Had to Go and Lose It at the Astor\", to its appearance in the 1945 film \"The Clock\", which provides a good view of the wartime-era lobby (although reconstructed in Hollywood). Among many other musicians, the swing era bandleader Tommy Dorsey appeared regularly on the rooftop bandstand, and it was there that Frank Sinatra made early New York appearances with Dorsey's band from 1940 to 1942. Another regular, in the 1950's, was Carmen Cavallaro and his orchestra, advertised on the marquee under the banner \"On the Astor Roof\".\n\nIn 1947, stuntman John Ciampa scaled the exterior of the hotel as part of a publicity ploy for the Sunbrock Rodeo and Thrill Circus. A 1947 post card, Hotel Astor claimed \"1000 rooms, 1000 baths\" and as \"The Crossroads of the World\"\n\nBeginning in the 1910s, the Astor Bar acquired a reputation as a gay meeting place. During World War II, the Astor Bar was one of three American hotel bars \"world famous for their wartime ambience\", alongside the Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco, and the men's bar at the Los Angeles Biltmore. Unlike the flamboyant late-night scenes at the automats, gay patrons at the Astor Bar were welcomed, allotted an entire side of the oval bar, and expected to be discreet (by the standards of the time). Thus \"the Astor maintained its public reputation as an eminently respectable Times Square rendezvous, while its reputation as a gay rendezvous and pickup bar assumed legendary proportions.\" The bar was further immortalized in Cole Porter's song \"Well, Did You Evah!\", which includes the line, \"Have you heard that Mimsie Starr / Just got pinched in the Astor Bar?\"\nThe ribald tune \"She Had to Go and Lose It at the Astor\" explored a similar theme.\n\nThe hotel was completely renovated in 1935, and again in 1949. It was sold to real estate entrepreneur William Zeckendorf on September 1, 1954. However he sold it again just two weeks later, on September 15, 1954, to Sheraton Hotels, who renamed it the Sheraton-Astor. Zeckendorf repurchased the hotel in December 1957, regaining control of it in March 1958 and returning it to its original name. During this period, the hotel was managed by Prince Serge Obolensky. As an indirect result of Zeckendorf's 1965 bankruptcy, the Astor was sold for $10.5 million in 1966. It closed and was demolished in 1967 by Sam Minskoff & Sons. The site is now occupied by a 54-story skyscraper designed by Der Scutt of Ely J. Kahn & Jacobs and completed in 1972.\n\n\n"}

Gallagher is best remembered for leading extensive explorations in the Beaufort Sea in the late 1970s.\n\nJack Gallagher was born in Winnipeg on 16 July 1916. In 1933 he graduated from St. John's High School. In the fall of 1933 Gallagher entered the University of Manitoba, studying engineering. Fearful about his prospects of getting a job in construction during the Great Depression, he later transferred to studying geology. During the summer of 1936, Gallagher worked for the Geological Survey of Canada in northern Manitoba. This first encounter with the north would inspire his return there later in his career.\n\nUpon graduating in 1937, Gallagher hitched a ride to Washington State and got a job selling Caterpillar tractors. After a year, Gallagher moved to California where he got a job as a scout with the Shell Oil Company. Despite not having experience in oil and gas, the company was interested in his field experience in the North. In January 1939 Shell sent Gallagher to Egypt. When the Second World War began in September of that year, Shell ceased its Egyptian operations and moved to the Dutch East Indies. Instead of transferring to the new location, Gallagher left Shell and began to work for the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, who remained in the region. At one point, Gallagher worked for the British Eighth Army searching for water wells. During his time in the east Gallagher also lectured on geology at the Cairo University.\n\nIn the early 1940s Standard transferred Gallagher to South America, where he spent time in Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. His South American stay led to many interesting experiences, including being granted a meeting with president Jorge Ubico to ask permission to search for oil in the north of the country. On another occasion, while in the passenger seat of a truck on a trip through the Andes, Gallagher's driver fainted from the altitude. Gallagher managed to steer the truck into a rock wall, preventing it from going off the cliff. Suffering from back pain, it was ten days before he was able to see a doctor, who concluded he was only experiencing muscle spasms. A year later in New York City, an X-Ray revealed three fractured vertebrae. Gallagher would have back pain the rest of his life. The pressure from giving a hand shake would often cause him pain, and to help the problem he would often use a two-hand clasp when meeting people.\n\nIn 1948 Standard sent Gallagher to Harvard University for a year to study management. Upon finishing at Harvard, Standard informed Gallagher that they wanted him to work as their head geologist in the Far East. Wanting to return to Canada, Gallagher instead took a job with Standard's Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil, in Calgary.\n\nIn 1950 Gallagher was approached by Jim McCrea of Dome Mines, an Toronto company that had been in existence since 1910. Wanting to expand their operations to include oil, the company formed Dome Exploration (Western), wanting Gallagher to head the new operation. Throughout the 1950s Dome remained a relatively small company. Gallagher worked primarily on his own and had an office in the Alberta Block at 805 1st Street South West with his secretary Ethel Cairns. In 1951 Dome became public, selling a half-million shares, and in 1958 it changed its name to Dome Petroleum and moved into the new Dome Building at 706 8th Avenue South West. Having become fascinated with the Canadian North during the summer of 1936, Gallagher remained interested in the potential for northern oil and gas exploration. In 1959 Gallagher first filed for land position in the north, and in September 1961 Dome became the first company to drill in the Canadian Arctic. In 1974 Gallagher was contacted by then Minister of Northern Affairs, Jean Chrétien, to ask if Dome would be interested in exploration in the Beaufort Sea. Dome's first season of exploration in the Beaufort was in 1976. By the early 1980s, Dome had built a fleet of around 40 vessels. Although Dome invested a great deal of money in Arctic exploration, it never made a major discovery.\n\nBy the early 1980s Gallagher, although still Chief Executive, had relinquished some power to younger members of the company. In May 1981 Dome set out to acquire the Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company, which at the time was controlled by the American company Conoco. Gallagher had opposed this move, although he ultimately allowed it to take place. That June, Dome took a U.S.$1.68 billion loan from the Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. In the fall Toronto-Dominion requested that part of the loan be repaid, at which time it was revealed that Dome did not have the money. This revelation threw the Canadian banking system into a state of chaos for the next year before a rescue package for Dome was developed in the fall of 1982. On 8 April 1983, Gallagher stepped down as the head of Dome. In his 33 years of running the company, he had turned a one-man operation into the third-largest private company in Canada, at the time.\n\nGallagher was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1983. After leaving Dome, he dedicated his time largely to political causes, helping to found the Reform Party of Canada. Gallagher was known for his affable personality and famous smile, being given the nickname \"Smilin' Jack.\" In August 1949 he married Kathleen Stewart, who was originally from Red Deer, Alberta. They, along with their three sons, lived in a house located at 4315 Britannia Drive in Calgary's mid-century Britannia neighbourhood. The house remains largely original today and has been featured in local architectural tours. Gallagher's personal papers are held at the Glenbow Museum as the \"Jack Gallagher fonds\".\n\n"}

{"id": "4693243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4693243", "title": "Listing and approval use and compliance", "text": "Listing and approval use and compliance\n\nListing and approval use and compliance is the activity of adhering to specific testing requirements designed to establish minimum performance for the installation or use of safety-related products and materials in conformance with an \"active\" certification listing or \"approval\" that has been issued by an organization that is accredited both for testing and product certification, such as those issued by Underwriters Laboratories, NTA Inc, FM Global, American Nuclear Insurers, or the Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik (DIBt). In concept, if a product, such as a fire door, fire extinguisher, or toaster, is used in the intended manner, the component or system will perform as described in the listing and/or \"approval\". The listing or test is often cited by a regulation, such as a building code or a fire code, and becomes enforcable through adopted codes or regulations. This concept is known as \"bounding\" in the nuclear industry. Products whose use is not mandated by any building codes or fire codes often lack a consensus test method. Unless there is a test standard in existence to prove the functionality and reliability of such a product, there can be no certification listing. Many authorities are charged to review and approve results from qualified testing agencies, when for the purpose intended, the evidence shows compliance for a material, product or construction method that provides equivalent strength, quality, fire resistance, durability and safety when evaluated through general engineering practices.\n\nNational, governmental accreditors, such as Germany's Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik or Canada's SCC (Standards Council of Canada) can \"accredit\" laboratories, meaning that such laboratories must conform to national standards and rules of conduct in the discharge of their duties. Compliance is routinely tested by the accreditor through inspections, where random client files are audited to see that the laboratory followed all appropriate procedures. Accreditors can accredit laboratories for testing, as well as for product certification. In product certification regimes, the laboratory or the accreditor (as in the case of Germany) become involved in witnessing the production of test materials, get copies of process standards, including chemical formulas and all details necessary to manufacture a product. Once the test product is made, it is shipped \"under seal\" to the laboratory for incorporation in the test. Certification listings or approvals that follow a successful test are subject to the maintenance of continuous factory auditing to make sure that what was tested is identical to that which was made, or documented proof that the products made continue to meet quality control standards set out as a function of the approvals process.\n\nTesting by organizations or laboratories who hold no national accreditation for testing purposes are not subject to mandatory governmental audits of compliance with applicable requirements. Even an organisation that is nationally accredited for testing purposes may not necessarily issue test reports that provide assurance that commercial products tested by it are the same as what is being sold or used by the public.\n\nSafety related products undergo product certification to enable their use by the public. The value of testing by organizations without accreditation for product certification is based on faith in the organisation or its ethics, or culpability. In countries in which a national authority is a present (e.g., the United States), the listings provided by large well established third-party testing and certification companies are accepted as the societal standard. In such cases, the link to the building code is through regional standards, such as the Uniform Building Code, or the Standard Building Code.\n\nManufacturers of products routinely test their own products and competitors' products for their own purposes, as it makes good fiscal sense to test in one's own lab before incurring the costs of a third party facility.\n\nProduct certification involves testing a product to a test standard that is accepted in the region in which the product will be sold. For instance, in the case of a firestop, Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada ULC-S115 is the test method that must be used by a laboratory whose tests are to be accepted in Canada. ULC is nationally accredited in Canada to write standards, test products and to certify products.\n\nBecause Canada uses the accreditation model of a national accrediting authority, if an organisation tests a firestop in or for use in Canada, in accordance with the correct standard (ULC-S115), but is not accredited by the SCC, the test results cannot be used to in any approvals of field installations on Canadian construction sites. If, on the other hand, the test laboratory is also accredited for product certification, then before the test takes place, a follow-up or certification agreement is anticipated between the certifier and the submitter of the test who desires a rating or a listing. An inspector from the certifying organisation witnesses the manufacture of the product or products to be tested, and checks the manufacturing procedures against the process standard that is in place and by then on file with the certifying organisation. The process standard includes all information necessary to manufacture the product or products, including equipment descriptions, tolerances, chemical formulas and purchasing specifications for ingredients or components. The manufactured goods are sealed by the inspector and then shipped to the laboratory, where the contents are used to build the test specimen in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nCheating in testing may include substitution of materials and components by the manufacturer, or additional measures to assure the product passes the test.\n\nAfter testing, the testing laboratory issues a test report to the manufacturer, who is not obliged to share it with anyone.\n\nIf the product passes the testing required for certification, the items in the test that passed are given a certification listing, which describes the product(s) that were tested, the application, and maximum and minimum tolerances for all components. Certification listings are short versions and interpretations of the test results.\n\nA certification listing indicates that the test has been properly conducted, the tested systems passed, and that a follow-up agreement is in effect between the manufacturer or submitter and the certifier. This means that in addition to the original inspection where the test materials were produced, the certifier makes inspections of the manufacturing facility to ensure that what is being manufactured and sold is still the same as what was originally tested.\n\nIn the event that irregularities are discovered on the part of the manufacturer - substitutions of cheaper ingredients or components, deliberate irregularities, or an ingredient or component of a tested system which is no longer be available has been substituted - the listing can be de-activated and the manufacturer asked to remove all logos of the certifier from product literature, promotional materials, packaging, etc.\n\nOrganisations accredited for testing and certification of safety-related items typically operate in large facilities where many test submitters work to build test specimens and then go to test. Confidentiality is of importance to most submitters as well as the laboratories. Some manufacturers are extremely reluctant to share their proprietary process standards with any third parties.\n\nIn Germany's system, formulas and process standards are shared with the governmental accreditor: DIBt . DIBt uses the laboratories to audit the factories, but the audits are restricted to quality control tests of the finished products - not their chemical compositions or exact process standards. In North America, manufacturers are obliged to share their process standards with the laboratories, as there is no national accreditor that issues \"approvals\". This has resulted in the use of \"fingerprinting\" procedures, where manufacturers will permit their laboratory inspectors to conduct infrared spectroanalysis and other QC tests, in place of the process standards.\n\nNorth American laboratories are usually private sector companies, though some of them are non-profit organisations, such as Underwriters Laboratories. There have been migrations of private sector laboratory engineers to manufacturers. Concerns over the sharing of confidential proprietary information are mitigated through confidentiality agreements.\n\nFire protection products used in the construction of buildings, ships and offshore facilities are required to conform with the certification listings or approvals. The field installation will comply with code requirements if it is configured within the maximum and minimum tolerances in the listings and approvals. For example, if a drywall assembly has a listing of a 2 hour fire-resistance rating, and all the provisions of the listing were kept in the field, including materials, spacing, workmanship, etc., the 2 hour wall required by the building's designer is likely to withstand a 2 hour fire.\n\nA case of the lack of mandatory bounding in US and Canadian nuclear power plant construction was the Thermo-Lag scandal, which was exposed by whistleblower Gerald W. Brown. The disclosure of the inadequacy of fire testing employed in the circuit integrity product led to widespread and costly remedial work for licensees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\n\n\n"}

He is also the elder brother of the former president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai.\n\nIn October 2010, the \"Washington Post\" reported that Karzai could soon be indicted for tax evasion in the U.S., by the Internal Revenue Service though he is aware of the investigation, telling the newspaper: \"I'm giving any charges\", and insisting his only interest is \"rebuilding Afghanistan.\" To date, no charges have been brought against Karzai.\n\nIn 2011, investigative reporters reported that Karzai was under review by a U.S. grand jury for alleged racketeering, extortion and tax evasion. He reportedly hired a Washington, D.C.-based criminal defense attorney as a result of the grand jury investigation.\n\nIn 2013, Karzai, who has resided in Afghanistan since 2002, renounced his American citizenship to assume a bigger role in Afghan politics.

MCM has 429 employees worldwide with satellite offices in New York, London, Zurich, Hong Kong and Washington, D.C.. MCM maintains six offshore funds and domestic equivalents of its largest funds. As of the end 2010, its fund's values were valued at: Moore Global Investments and Remington combined; $8.2 billion, Moore Macro Managers; $4.3 billion; Moore Emerging Markets; $1.5 billion. The remaining three funds each in possession of between $81 million and $324 million.\n\nMCM is characterized as a global macro investor, utilizing macroeconomic themes, cash, futures and derivatives in its portfolios. Bacon, its founder, participates in most of the global markets, basing his moves on his evaluation of the future trends of inflation, economic growth, central bank policy and national politics. He then determines what themes and investments to play based on data from his strategists and researchers.\n\nMoore Capital Management MCM was founded by Bacon in 1989, who launched Moore Global Investments in 1990 using the $25,000 he inherited from his mother and named the company using his middle name.\n\nMCM's first investor was Antoine Bernheim, president of Dome Capital Management, who in 1990 accounted for $1.5 million of MCM's initial $1.8 million in assets and redeemed his investment in 2009.\n\nMCM launched the Moore Macro Managers Fund in 1993 and is led by 14 manager teams. From 1993 until 2009, the Macro Managers fund held the name, Moore Global Fixed Income Fund. Until 2002, Bacon himself was very much involved in the management of the fund but later it became a macro fund and the name was revised accordingly. Between 2002 through 2005, its assets under management grew to $4 billion from $1.8 billion. The fund has not had any down years and has compounded at 15 percent annually through 2010.

{"id": "25508182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25508182", "title": "Nigerian Civil Service", "text": "Nigerian Civil Service\n\nThe Nigerian Civil Service consists of employees in Nigerian government agencies other than the military and police. \nMost employees are career civil servants in the Nigerian ministries, progressing based on qualifications and seniority. Recently the head of the service has been introducing measures to make the ministries more efficient and responsive to the public.\n\nThe word civil is derived from an old french word \"civil\" which means \"relating to law\" and directly from Latin word \"civilis\" which means \"relating to citizen\". while the word service is derived from an old french word \"servise\" which means \"aids\".\nThe Nigerian Civil Service has its origins in organizations established by the British in colonial times.\nNigeria gained full independence in October 1960 under a constitution that provided for a parliamentary government and a substantial measure of self-government for the country's three regions.\nSince then, various panels have studied and made recommendations for reforming of the Civil Service, including the Margan Commission of 1963, the Adebo Commission of 1971 and the Udoji Commission of 1972-74.\nA major change occurred with the adoption in 1979 of a constitution modeled on that of the United States. \nThe Dotun Philips Panel of 1985 attempted to reform to the Civil Service. The 1988 Civil Service Reorganization Decree promulgated by General Ibrahim Babangida had a major impact on the structure and efficiency of the Civil Service.\nThe later report of the Ayida Panel made recommendations to reverse some of the past innovations and to return to the more efficient Civil Service of earlier years.\nThe Civil Service has been undergoing gradual and systematic reforms and restructuring since May 29, 1999 after decades of military rule.\nHowever, the civil service is still considered stagnant and inefficient, and the attempts made in the past by panels have had little effect.\n\nIn August 2009 the Head of the Civil Service, Stephen Osagiede Oronsaye, proposed reforms where permanent secretaries and directors would spend a maximum of eight years in office. The reform, approved by President Umaru Yar'Adua, would result in massive retirement of Permanent Secretaries and Directors, many of whom are from the North.\nStephen Oronsaye has said that his goal is for the Nigerian civil service to be among the best organized and managed in the world.\nOronsaye retired in November 2010 at the statutory age of 60 and was succeeded by Oladapo Afolabi.\n\nThe civil service is mainly organized around the federal ministries, headed by a minister appointed by the President of Nigeria, who must include at least one member of each of the 36 states in his cabinet. The President's appointments are confirmed by the Senate of Nigeria. There are less than 36 ministries. In some cases a Federal minister is responsible for more than one ministry(e.g. Environment and Housing may be combined)and a minister may be assisted by one or more ministers of State.\nEach ministry also has a Permanent Secretary, who is a senior civil servant.\nThe ministries are responsible for various[parastatals(government-owned corporations) such as universities (Education), National Broadcasting Commission, Information and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.\nOther parastatals are the responsibility of the Office of the Presidency, such as the Independent National Electoral Commission, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Federal Civil Service Commission.\nThe service has six additional units which provide services to all departments on the Civil Service:\n\nA sense of the relative expenditure on the different areas is given by the table below, which shows the 2008 budget for Federal ministries, departments and agencies.\n\nNote: As of January 2008, one Naira was worth about 0.0057 Euros, or 0.0084 US Dollars.\n\nPermanent secretaries head the civil service departments. In August 2009, Stephen Oronsaye announced a major reshuffle where almost half of the permanent secretaries were assigned to new departments. \nA partial list of the new line-up as of December 2009 follows:\n\nOn November 10, 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari summoned all the permanent secretaries to the Presidential Villa in Aso Rock and sacked all 17 of them; their terminations in force with immediate effect.\n\ntheophilus erebho, unn, PALG\n\n"}

The law also restricted economic activities of foreign firms to certain areas and obliged the firms to add Nigerians as partners. Up to 1,130 companies were affected, some companies transferred equity through private placement while others listed on the stock exchange. A total of 81 companies listed shares on the stock exchange worth a total value of 210 million naira while majority offered the shares through private placement.\n\nThe decree was repealed in 1995 with the promulgation of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Act.\n\nPrior to the end of colonial rule in 1960, Nigerian businessmen had been agitating for protection of indigenous capital from foreign competition, while a clamour to reduce expatriate quota resulted in Nigerianisation in many institutions. Following decolonization, aspirations of economic independence and self-determination became pronounced and began to earn broad base support. An indigenisation policy championed by bureaucrats and Nigerian businessmen was pursued within the Federal Government's National Development Plan for 1970–74. In February 1972, the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree was promulgated to be effective in April 1974. The new legislation was planned to give Nigerians more access to surplus income of businesses, shift foreign investment to highly technical areas and promote indigenous businesses.\n\nThe military administration was more amenable to make the changes than their previous democratic counterpart partly because of their increasing distrust of foreign capital, an aftermath of their experience in relying on foreign governments and multinational corporations during the Nigerian Civil War and the lack of prompt response of oil companies to make payments exclusively to the Federal Government.\n\nNEPC decree of 1972 was a legislation to effect changes in the ownership structure of light industries such as retail and small scale businesses. Industries were divided into two divisions called schedule 1 and schedule 2. Along with the decree was the establishment of the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Board to manage the implementation of the new law. Following the spirit of the new law, the government acquired interest in major expatriate led banks within the country including First Bank of Nigeria and Union Bank of Nigeria and mandated a compulsory percentage of loans be made to Nigerians. The government also acquired interest in the insurance and oil and gas sectors. A new bank, the Nigerian bank of Commerce and Industry came into existence to facilitate loans to Nigerians for the purpose of investing in foreign owned firms. \n\nPrior to 1977, criticism of the existing law led to a couple of amendments but the most significant was in 1977. Critics had felt the changes created a new bourgeois that purchased majority of the shares. In addition, while 950 business were affected under the 1972 decree some had requested exemptions and not all were compliant by April 1974. Some affected enterprises were alleged to have conspired with some Nigerians who will come in as a silent partner or front as chairman of the board of directors but the firm will be managed by line personnel expatriates in the backroom. The new amendment of 1977 limited the number of companies an individual could gain majority control and empowered the enterprises promotion board with the ability to seal the offices of non compliant firms.. Businesses where divided into three schedules. Under schedule one, ownership of businesses shall be 100% indigenous. Business activities under this schedule were related to the retail and service sector, advertising, bakeries, commercial transportation and estate agencies. Under schedule two, ownership will be 60% owned by Nigerian. Under the amendment additional sectors were added to schedule 2, this included banking, insurance, food processing, petrochemicals and iron and steel.\n"}

He hosts \"Late Night Live\", an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) program on Radio National four nights a week. He also writes a weekly column for \"The Weekend Australian\".\n\nAdams has had careers in advertising and film production and has served on many non-profit boards including Greenpeace Australia, Ausflag, Care Australia, Film Victoria, National Museum of Australia, both the Adelaide and Brisbane festivals of ideas, the Montsalvat Arts Society and the Don Dunstan Foundation.\n\nAdams has been appointed both a member and subsequently an officer of the Order of Australia; and he has received numerous awards including five honorary doctorates from Australian universities; Republican of the Year 2005; the Senior ANZAC Fellowship; the Australian Humanist of the Year, the Golden Lion at Cannes; the Longford Award; a Walkley Award; and the Henry Lawson Australian Arts Award. In 1997 the International Astronomical Union named a minor planet orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter after him. A National Trust poll elected him one of Australia's 100 national living treasures.\n\nAdams was born in Maryborough, Victoria, the only child of Congregational Church minister, the Reverend Charles Adams. His childhood was anything but idyllic and his parents separated when he was young. Interviewed in 2006, Adams said that:My first memories were my mother... absolutely dependent on the begging bowl – that little round dish with a piece of cloth at the bottom where parishioners would put a couple of bob. When dad went off to the war, I was taken up by my grandparents... and lived on a dirt-poor farm... I lived in penury for the first 10, 15 years of my life. ... Mother dumped [my father] in favour of a rather sleazy businessman ... a sociopath who tried to murder me ... I spent my latter part of my childhood trying to protect my mother from this psycho.Of his education he has said: \"I was forced to leave school before completing my secondary education and the only job I could get was working in advertising.\"\n\nAdams joined the Australian Communist Party at age 16, whilst employed in advertising, but left at age 19. He has often compared dogmatic belief in communism to dogmatic belief in Roman Catholicism.\n\nAdams began his advertising career with Foote Cone & Belding and, later, with Brian Monahan and Lyle Dayman, became a partner in the agency Monahan Dayman Adams. They took that company to a successful public listing and Adams became a millionaire in the process. He developed successful campaigns such as \"Life. Be in it.\", \"Slip, Slop, Slap\", \"Break down the Barriers\", \"Guess whose mum's got a Whirlpool\" and \"Watch the big men fly for a Herbert Adams Pie\", working with talent such as Fred Schepisi, Alex Stitt, Peter Best, Robyn Archer and Mimmo Cozzolino. Adams left the advertising industry in the 1980s. Monahan Dayman Adams purchased the successful Sydney agency MoJo in 1987 and carried on as MojoMDA. Its lineage can today be traced to Publicis Mojo, an Australian subsidiary of the French multinational advertising and communications company holding Publicis Groupe.\n\nHe wrote regular columns for \"The Age\" and \"The Bulletin\". He currently writes a weekly column for \"The Australian\".\n\nAdams played a key role in the revival of the Australian film industry during the 1970s. He was the author of a 1969 report which led to legislation by Prime Minister John Gorton in 1970 for an Australian Film and Television Development Corporation (later the Australian Film Commission) and the Experimental Film Fund.\n\nTogether with Barry Jones, Adams was a motivating force behind the Australian Film Television and Radio School which was established under the Whitlam government. Adams played a key role in the development of the South Australian Film Corporation, which was created in 1972 and became a model for similar bodies in other Australian states; and in the establishment of the Australia Council and the Australian Film Development Corporation, later known as the Australian Film Commission, the Film Finance Corporation Australia, and Screen Australia. As head of delegation to the Cannes Film Festival, Adams signed Australia's first co-production agreements with France and the UK. He was Chairman of the Australian Film Institute, the Film and Television Board of the Australia Council, the Australian Film Commission, and Film Australia. He helped establish the Australian Caption Service, which provides services for hearing-impaired television viewers – and the Travelling Film Festival to take quality films into rural areas.\n\nIn the 1960s Adams co-wrote, co-produced and co-directed (as well as serving as cinematographer for) his first feature film \"\" (1969); the first feature to win the AFI Award, and the first Australian film to win the Grand Prix at an international festival.\n\nAdams produced or co-produced other features including the critically panned but hugely popular film adaptation of Barry Humphries' \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie\", directed by Bruce Beresford, which became the most successful Australian film ever made up to that time. Other films include \"The Naked Bunyip\", \"Don's Party\", \"The Getting of Wisdom\", \"Lonely Hearts\", \"We of the Never Never\", \"Grendel Grendel Grendel\", \"Fighting Back\", \"Hearts and Minds\" and \"Abra Cadabra\".\n\nAdams initially presented a late-night program on Sydney commercial radio station 2UE during the late 1980s and early 1990s before succeeding Virginia Bell in 1991 at ABC Radio National's \"Late Night Live\", a magazinestyle program that broadcasts analysis of current events to Australian and international politics, science, philosophy and culture. \"Late Night Live\" is broadcast across Australia on ABC Radio National, as well as on Radio Australia and the Internet. The program is broadcast live from 22:00 AEST/ADST and is repeated the following day at 16:00 AEST/ADST. A serious discussion of world issues, the program is tempered with Adams' gentle and ironic humour. Regular contributors include Bruce Shapiro and Beatrix Campbell.\n\nAt times, Adams refers tongue-in-cheek to his listeners as \"the listener\" or \"Gladys\", as though he had only one listener; he also refers to listeners collectively as \"Gladdies\". In more recent years, Adams has begun introducing the show saying \"Good evening Gladdies and Poddies\", in reference to the show's growing podcast listener base.\n\nThe current theme music is a short extract from Elena Kats-Chernin's \"Wild Swans Concert Suite\", performed by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra with soprano Jane Sheldon, chosen in 2010. From 2007 to 2010, the theme music was Kats-Chernin's \"Russian Rag\", which Adams humorously refers to as \"The Waltz of the Wombat\". The previous music was Bach's Concerto for oboe, violin and orchestra in C minor, BWV 1060: III. \"Allegro\".\n\nAdams was the foundation chairman of the Commission for the Future, established by the Hawke government to build bridges between science and the community. In 1988 the Commission won a major United Nations award for educating Australia on the issue of greenhouse and climate change. He chaired the National Australia Day Council; whose principal task was to choose the Australian of the Year.\n\nHe also chaired the Advisory Board for the Centre of the Mind at the University of Sydney and the Australia National University and has been a board member of Greenpeace Australia, CARE Australia, the National Museum of Australia, The Australian Centre for Social Innovation, the Adelaide Festival of Ideas and Brisbane's Ideas Festival. He was co-founder of the Australian Skeptics.\n\nAdams is the author or editor of more than 20 books, including \"The Unspeakable Adams\", \"Adams Versus God\", \"The Penguin Book of Australian Jokes\", \"Retreat from Tolerance\", \"Talkback and A Billion Voices\", \"Adams Ark\", and, with Lee Burton, \"Emperors of the Air\".\n\nRobert Manne has described Adams as \"the emblematic figurehead of the pro-Labor left intelligentsia\". Adams had a close relationship with every Labor leader from Gough Whitlam to Kevin Rudd, advising on public relations, advertising and policy issues. However, on 19 July 2006, he was reported as saying of the Labor Party:They hate me. I think Kim Beazley is a serious error. I think the party's been going downhill federally ever since Keating left ... The Labor Party's hardly worth feeding federally.In 2010, Adams resigned from the Labor Party after Rudd was defeated as the Leader of the Labor Party at the 2010 Labor leadership spill.\n\nIn 1995 Adams argued against Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, saying that a better response to expressions of racial hatred was \"public debate, not legal censure\".\n\nAdams' life and extracurricular activities have made him a source of interest to fans and foes of all persuasions for many years.

Over time, with the changes in social work being more psychotherapy-oriented, rehabilitation counselors take on more and more community engagement work, especially as it relates to special populations. Some rehabilitation counselors focus solely on community engagement through vocational services, others in various states qualify as both a certified rehabilitation counselor (CRC) and a licensed professional counselor (LPC), enabling them to focus on psychotherapy.\n\nHistorically, rehabilitation counselors primarily served working-age adults with disabilities. Today, the need for rehabilitation counseling services extends to persons of all age groups who have disabilities. Rehabilitation counselors also may provide general and specialized counseling to people with disabilities in public human service programs and private practice settings.\n\nInitially, rehabilitation professionals were recruited from a variety of human service disciplines, including public health nursing, social work, and school counseling. Although educational programs began to appear in the 1940s, it was not until the availability of federal funding for rehabilitation counseling programs in 1954 that the profession began to grow and establish its own identity.\n\nThough no specific undergraduate degree is required, the majority of rehabilitation counseling graduate students have undergraduate degrees in rehabilitation services, psychology, sociology, or other human services-related fields. As a master's degree is required at a minimum, rehabilitation counselors are trained at the graduate level, with most earning a master's degree, and a few continuing on to the Doctoral level. The Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE) accredits qualifying institutions, though not all programs meet accreditation requirements, prohibiting some graduates from professional certification/licensure. Rehabilitation counselors are trained in the following areas:\n\nAccredited rehabilitation counselor education programs typically provide 60 credit hours of academic and field-based clinical training. Clinical training consists of at least a semester of practicum and a minimum of 600 hours of supervised internship experience. Clinical field experiences are available in a variety of community, state, federal, and private rehabilitation-related programs.\n\nThe Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC) grants certification to counselors who meet educational requirements and have passed an examination indicating that they possess the competency and skill to become a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor, (CRC in the United States; CCRC in Canada). A Master's degree is required to obtain certification. Certification as a rehabilitation counselor is not mandated by any state or federal laws, however eligibility to sit for the certification exam is mandated by federal law for those wishing to work for state/federal vocational rehabilitation systems. Some states have Licensed Rehabilitation Counselors (LRC), which places LRCs at the same level as other licensed social service professionals. In other states the CRC qualifies the rehabilitation counselor to obtain the Licensure as a Professional Counselor (LPC). Certification is highly desirable to many employers.\n\nCommunity service to a culturally and ethnically diverse population, professional functions, critical thinking, advocacy, applied research activities, and ethical standards are integrated throughout rehabilitation counselor preparation and development. Though rehabilitation counselors are adept at understanding medical issues surrounding the disability (as proven by certification/licensure), they are trained in the social model of disability, which identifies systemic barriers, negative attitudes and exclusion by society (purposely or inadvertently) that mean society is the main contributory factor in disabling people. Rehabilitation Counselors are often advocates in the community for people with disabilities outside of the workplace, with most doing some form of community engagement. As a good portion of counselors have disabilities themselves, the counseling process often emphasizes self-advocacy skills. Rehabilitation counselors can be found in the leadership of many prominent organizations that support human rights and civil rights for people with disabilities such as American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities, National Black Deaf Advocates, etc.\n\n\nIn the United States, many rehabilitation counselors work in a variety of arenas. The predominant placement of rehabilitation counselors are state rehabilitation programs as Vocational Counselors, social service agencies as Administrators, and at the collegiate level as Disability Counselors/Specialists:\n\nThe predominant need for rehabilitation counselors is within federal/state funded vocational rehabilitation programs. While the Veterans Benefits Administration has its own vocational rehabilitation program, the rest of Federal/State Vocational Rehabilitation Programs are funded and regulated by the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), a division of the U.S Department of Education. Although policies vary from state to state, rehabilitation counselors who work in the federal/state systems typically must hold a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling, special education or a related field, and are required to be certified or be eligible to sit for the certification examination. People accepting employment in the federal/state Vocational Rehabilitation programs do so with the agreement they will meet these qualifications by a specified date to maintain employment.\n\nRehabilitation Counselors can work in the non-profit/corporate sector in various ways. Though the majority start as counselors, specializing in career counseling, most rehabilitation counselors that work in the non-profit arena rise to the administration level, either in supervising staff or directing programs for people with disabilities. Others supervise staff that work in case management programs that serve people with disabilities. Some rehabilitation counselors work with Independent Living Centers, doing community engagement, advocacy, outside referrals, and social service provision for people with disabilities. Entrepreneurial rehabilitation counselors also work as consultants, establishing their own private service agencies. Counselors in working with corporations focus on community relations or corporate service, serving as liaisons between companies and charities or service programs.\n\nBy law all community colleges, colleges and universities are required to make reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. To satisfy this requirement most collegial settings have a Disability Resources Center, a Special Needs Coordinator or a similar office. Staff are responsible for coordinating services that \"may\" include but are not limited to: advocacy/liaison, computer access, counseling (academic, personal, vocational), equipment loan, information/referral services, in-service awareness programs, notetakers, on campus orientation and mobility training for visually impaired students, priority registration assistance, readers, scribes, shuttle (on-campus), sign language interpreters, test proctoring/testing accommodations, and tutors.\n\nSome adaptive technological accommodations \"may\" include but are not limited to: Adaptive computer technology (including voice activated and speech output), Assistive listening devices, Films/videotapes about disabilities, Kurzweil personal reader, Large print software,Print enlargers (CCTV), Raised-line drawing kit, Tactile map of campus, Talking calculators, Tape recorders/APH Talking Book Machine, TDD for hearing impaired, Wheelchair, Wheelchair access maps.\n\nStudents who have documentation proving their disability status and the staff are trained to access or have knowledge of the necessary services according to the students' unique need. As the college level is different from the primary school system, the same services that a student may have received within a special education program in high school may not be required at the collegiate level. A wide variety of students with disabilities can be served, some examples are individuals with: learning disabilities, sensorial disabilities (hearing loss, vision loss, etc.), physical disabilities (cerebral palsy, etc.) and psychological disabilities.\n\nForensic rehabilitation counselors can work as consultants, serving as witnesses and advocates in the legal profession. Forensic rehab counselors serve as legal advisors with specialized information on disability in the areas of higher education access, Social Security, marital dissolution, personal injury, and Worker’s Compensation. \n\nAccording to a survey of 1,220 Certified Rehabilitation Counselors(CRC) conducted by the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CORE), CRCs working within a forensic/expert witness job function have the highest annual salary ($93,000) of all job functions analyzed. Furthermore, when average salaries were analyzed by primary work setting, CRCs working within business or industry have the highest annual salary ($78,000) of all settings listed, which is $30,000 more than CRCs working in state/federal rehabilitation agencies. High annual salaries in the forensic area may be a key attraction for CRCs seeking to transition from the public sector. Academic programs require a graduate degree from an accredited rehabilitation counseling program, and enable the student to: learn about the role that counselors provide within the legal system; gain expertise in the ethical standards expected of expert witnesses; learn about the processes followed within legal cases when testifying on one’s expert opinion; gain an understanding of the business aspects of a forensic counselor’s work that breed success in this area of specialization.\n\nAs of 2010 there were 129,800 working in the field. Jobs for rehabilitation counselors are expected to grow by 28 percent, which is much faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nThere are several professional organizations Rehabilitation Counselors and other rehabilitation professionals belong to, including the American Rehabilitation Counseling Association, National Rehabilitation Counseling Association, and American Rehabilitation Action Network. Though there is no nationwide union or lobbying organization supporting rehabilitation counselors (such as is the case with social workers, or psychologists), the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC) does a lot of work in organizing rehabilitation counselors that pursue the professional advancement of the young field.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "615976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=615976", "title": "Residual value", "text": "Residual value\n\nResidual value is one of the constituents of a leasing calculus or operation. It describes the future value of a good in terms of absolute value in monetary terms and it is sometimes abbreviated into a percentage of the initial price when the item was new.\n\nExample: A car is sold at a list price of $20,000 today. After a usage of 36 months and 50,000 miles its value is contractually defined as $10,000 or 50%. The credited amount, on which the interest is applied, thus is $20,000 present value minus $10,000 future value.\n\nResidual values are contractually dealt with either in terms of closed contracts or open contracts.\n\nIn accounting, residual value is another name for salvage value, the remaining value of an asset after it has been fully depreciated.\n\nThe residual value derives its calculation from a base price, calculated after depreciation.\n\nResidual values are calculated using a number of factors, generally a vehicles market value for the term and mileage required is the start point for the calculation, followed by seasonality, monthly adjustment, lifecycle and disposal performance. The leasing company setting the residual values (RVs) will use their own historical information to insert the adjustment factors within the calculation to set the end value being the residual value.\n\nIn accounting, the residual value could be defined as an estimated amount that an entity can obtain when disposing of an asset after its useful life has ended. When doing this the estimated costs of disposing of the asset should be deducted.\n\nThe formula to calculate the residual value can be seen with the next example as follows:\n\nA company owns a machine which was bought for €20,000. This machine has a useful life of five years which has just ended. The company knows that if it sells the machine now it will be able to recover 10% of the price of acquisition.\n\nTherefore, the residual value would be:\n\nformula_1\n"}

He was a co-founder and leader of the Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT) and was mainly responsible for developing the party's progressive and reformist economic and social platform. After the party's electoral victory, he served as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Commerce in Thaksin Shinawatra's government. Following the coup d'état in 2006, the junta chose him as an economic envoy, advocating the royally-endorsed \"self-sufficiency\" economic agenda.\n\nAfter another military coup in 2014, he served as the junta's advisor on foreign economic relations. Since September 2014 he has been a full member of the so-called National Council for Peace and Order.\n\nSomkid was born in Bangkok and grew up in a large, but modest Thai Chinese (Teochew) family, one of 10 children. His great-great grandfather immigrated from China during the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (early 19th century). Despite being born and raised in Thailand, Somkid still speaks Thai with a strong Chinese accent. One of his older brothers, Som Jatusripitak later became president of Siam City Bank and Commerce Minister in Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's government.\n\nHis wife, Anurachanee Jatusripitak, teaches at Chulalongkorn University. They have three children.\n\nSomkid went to Triam Udom Suksa School and graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Economics, Thammasat University in 1972. Later, he completed an MBA in Finance from the Graduate School of Business Administration (NIDA Business School), National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA) and a Ph.D. in marketing from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.\n\nAfter graduating, he joined a teaching position and became Associate Professor in Marketing at the Graduate School of Business Administration (NIDA Business School). He also served as an Associate Dean at NIDA Business School. Somkid's thinking was greatly influenced by Michael Porter's \"Competitiveness of Nations\". He focused much of his academic research on the development of national and business competitiveness. Along with his mentor Philip Kotler, he was a strong supporter of the concept of Nation Branding. In 1997, Somkid co-authored \"The Marketing of Nations: A Strategic Approach to Building National Wealth\" with Philip Kotler. The book outlined how countries could improve their competitiveness through marketing and appropriate policies to support it. Somkid's book, \"Borisat Prathet Thai\" (\"Thailand Inc: Concepts and Strategy\"), stressed how Thailand should use marketing to improve its competitiveness.\n\nSomkid was a co-founder of the Manager Media Group, along with Sondhi Limthongkul. He played a role in the establishment of the Phatra Research Institute. He became a Director of the Saha Pattanapibul Group, a major Thai consumer goods conglomerate. He was appointed to become Advisor of the Stock Exchange of Thailand, Director of PTTEP, and Director of the Petroleum Authority of Thailand.\n\nSomkid became secretary to Foreign Minister Thaksin Shinawatra under Banharn Silpa-Archa's government (1995–96).\n\nSomkid became secretary to Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya under Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's government (1996–97).\n\nSomkid was one of the co-founders of the Thai Rak Thai party in 1998, along with party leader Thaksin Shinawatra. His senior stature in the party was apparent from his no. 3 position in the TRT's 2001 election party list, behind Thaksin Shinawatra and Purachai Piemsomboon.\n\nSomkid has been called \"the man behind \"Thaksinomics\"\", and was the mastermind of the populist policies that helped propel the Thai Rak Thai party to a landslide election victory in 2001. The TRT \"won by embracing\npopulism on a grand scale,\" said the Far Eastern Economic Review. Somkid's chief policy innovations included the universal healthcare program, 1 million THB development funds for each of Thailand's 70,000 villages, a 3-year loan freeze for farmers, fast-track privatization of state enterprises, and a national asset management corporation (AMC) to buy up the $20 billion in bad debt carried by Thai banks.\n\nSomkid also pioneered the TRT party's rural small and medium enterprise (SME) policy. Noting that agriculture remains the most important economic sector, employing 60-70% of the Thai population, the economic challenge was to develop the agricultural sector and link it with the modern sector. This became one of the founding principles of the Thaksin government's popular One Tambon One Product (OTOP) program.\n\nAt the time, \"The Nation\" newspaper exclaimed that these policies \"amount to a revolution in Thai public policy\".\n\nFrom the TRT's landslide election win of 2001, Somkid was a core member of Thakin's economic inner cabinet - starting off as Finance Minister and then becoming Commerce Minister.\n\nIn his term as Finance Minister (February 2001 to February 2003), Somkid\n\nIn his term as Commerce Minister (August 2005 to September 2006), Somkid\n\nDuring the anti-Thaksin demonstrations of 2005-2006, Thaksin noted that Somkid was one of four individuals who might succeed him as Prime Minister if he stepped down.\n\nIn March 2006, during the height of the anti-Thaksin protests, Somkid underwent balloon angioplasty surgery to relieve a blood clot in an artery near his heart.\n\nAfter Thaksin Shinawatra's announcement that he would not accept the Premiership from Parliament after the April 2006 elections, Somkid was widely seen as a potential replacement. In a poll of businessmen, 57% said Somkid was the most suitable candidate for new premier. The next highest TRT politician was Bhokin Bhalakula, who received only 12%. Soon later, a broad coalition of TRT factions, including Wang Nam Yom (130 MPs), Rim Nam (15 MPs), Lamtakong (7 MPs), Wang Phya Nag (10 MPs), Chon Buri (7 MPs) and the Central provinces (10 MPs) decided to push for Somkid Jatusripitak as the next prime minister.\n\nThe Thai military staged a successful coup against the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006. At the time, Somkid was in Paris, attending the Thai-France Cultural Exhibition with Princess Sirindhorn and Foreign Minister Kantathi Supamongkhon. On 21 September 2006 arrived back to Bangkok. Unlike several other senior members of Thaksin's Cabinet, he was not arrested by the junta. Somkid kept a low profile, until on 2 October 2006 he resigned from the Thai Rak Thai Party, along with Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nHe continued to lead a low profile, until in February 2007, he was appointed head of a government committee charged with \"preaching\" King Bhumibol's self-sufficient economy policy. The appointment provoked great controversy, as critics claimed that the populist economics czar had no role promoting self-sufficiency. Somkid appointment was supported by General Saprang Kalyanamitr, a powerful member of the junta, and Sondhi Limthongkul of the People's Alliance for Democracy, a long-time colleague of Somkid's. Somkid later decided to resign from the committee, which was then dissolved. Somkid's long-time rival, Finance Minister Pridiyathorn Devakula volunteered to help perform the committee's role, and denied any role in Somkid's resignation.\n\nIn early May 2007, a group of former elected senators said they were ready to support Somkid in forming a new political party, the so-called Dharma Thippatai group. Among those included Suraporn Danaitangtrakoon, Anek Laothamatas (former leader of the Mahachon Party), and former Thai Rak Thai members Suranand Vejjajiva and Pimol Srivikorn. On 26 June 2007, they founded Ruam Jai Thai. However, on 30 May 2007 the Constitutional Tribunal had produced a verdict, barring all 111 former executive members of Thai Rak Thai Party, including Somkid, from holding political office for five years.\n\nIn 2012, Somkid founded the \"Thailand Future Study Institute\", a think tank which is sponsored by major Thai business corporations and seeks to provide research and consulting to public bodies and private sector.\n\nAfter the 22 May 2014 coup d'état, the junta—which calls itself National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO)—appointed Somkid member of its \"advisory board\" in charge of foreign economic relations, especially with Asian countries China and Japan. On 16 September Somkid—as one of two civilians— was appointed as a member of the NCPO.\n\n"}

The aerodrome is located northeast of Northampton and was originally opened in 1928 on the edge of Sywell village.\n\nThe aerodrome caters for private flying, flight training and corporate flights. There is one fixed-wing flying school, one microlight school and a helicopter school. The 1930s Art Deco hotel has bar and restaurant facilities. Aviation related industries and businesses are also located at the aerodrome.\n\nNorthampton (Sywell) Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P496) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Sywell Aerodrome Limited).\n\nA viewing area is provided for aircraft spotters.\n\nThe aerodrome opened in 1928 and during the Second World War the aerodrome as RAF Sywell, was used as a training facility (Tiger Moths) and later an important centre for the repair of Wellington bombers and extensive sheds from this time still remain on the site. Among World War II pilots who underwent training at Sywell were Pierre Clostermann and Paddy Finucane, who soloed here.\n\nMany aerial shots for the film \"Battle of Britain\" were taken over the airport and nearby area.\n\nSince 1999, the aerodrome sought planning permission for a hard runway, which was intended to allow operations to continue over the winter, when the grass runways often become waterlogged. The organisations STARE (Stop The Aerodrome Runway Expansion) and CPRE (Campaign to Protect Rural England) campaigned against this change, arguing that it would lead to more and larger aircraft flying over the area and disturb its \"rural tranquility\".\nPermission was granted for the runway on 22 November 2007 by the Department for Transport, and though campaigners vowed to fight the decision they were unsuccessful and construction of the runway began in 2008. It opened during summer 2009 and enabled safe operations during the winter of 2009/2010 and onwards. In February 2010, the final inspection of the newly completed all-weather hard runway was carried out by the CAA who confirmed that it could be licensed for use.\nSywell has three all-grass operational runways and a fourth all-weather concrete runway. The aerodrome's operational hours are 0900-1700 during winter and 0800-1700 during summer. The aerodrome offers an Aerodrome Flight Information Service to pilots.\n\nThe aerodrome also houses the Sywell Aviation Museum dedicated to telling the wartime history of the site and the airmen that used it.\n\nBrooklands Flying Club was based at Sywell, with a fleet of four Aero AT-3 aircraft and a Cessna 172. The club offered training for a Private Pilot's Licence (PPL), night rating and IMC rating.\n\nThe club opened in 2005 under the same name of the previous company that had been located on the airfield.\nThe flying school closed down at the end of 2013. The club has since reopened as 2Excel Training, operated in partnership with 2Excel Aviation, owners of The Blades aerobatics team, who are also based at the airfield.\n\nOther flight training organisations on the airfield include:\n\nThe Blades aerobatic display team are based at Sywell, where their five Extra EA-300 aircraft are hangared. They perform aerobatic displays at major events around the country, in Europe, and in the Middle East. The team is the only one fully licensed by the CAA to carry paying 'passengers' in aerobatic displays, out of Sywell, or at many other locations.\n\nThe aerodrome now hosts a bi-annual charity airshow in aid of the local Air Ambulance where there are many classic aircraft flying and on display such as the Catalina, Mustang, North American Harvards.\n\nThe Light Aircraft Association (LAA - formerly the Popular Flying Association), is the UK's body for amateur aircraft construction, and recreational and sport flying. It used to hold its annual rally at Cranfield Airport, and then at Kemble Airport. In 2006, the LAA lost so much money through poor attendances resulting from poor weather that in 2007 and 2008, much smaller (and cheaper) \"regional rallies\" were held. These were unpopular and in September 2009 a revived (if cut-down) LAA Rally was held at Sywell. This proved successful, and as further well-attended rallies took place at Sywell since, the long-term future of the LAA Rally seems secure.\n\nMusic in Flight is an airshow held at Sywell, in which an orchestra plays classical music to accompany flying aircraft, hot air balloons, the Red Devils parachute display team and a fireworks display.\n\nAn industrial area in the complex accommodates firms, agencies and other commercial businesses.\n\n"}
