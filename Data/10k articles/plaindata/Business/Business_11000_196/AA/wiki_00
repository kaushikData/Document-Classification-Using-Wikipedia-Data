He was one of the \"moderates\" on the five-members Junta of National Reconstruction that the Sandinistas claimed would rule Nicaragua following the overthrow of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. However, Robelo found that the real power lay with the FSLN National Directorate.\n\nAfter resigning from the Junta on April 22, 1981, Robelo went into exile in 1982. He brought his MDN into Edén Pastora's rebel Democratic Revolutionary Alliance. Later, he split with Pastora, and joined the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) with Arturo Cruz, and Adolfo Calero of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force. After UNO's collapse, he joined the directorate of the new Contra umbrella group, the Nicaraguan Resistance.\n\nDuring the political turmoil, Robelo's first marriage, to Indiana Cardenal Caldera, ended in divorce. They had four children: Indiana Margarita, Luis Alfonso (who died at a year and a half old), Eliza, and Alejandra. He remarried a Costa Rican.\n\nFollowing the Esquipulas accord, President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica announced in January 1988 that Contra leaders could no longer live in his country. With his pregnant wife opposing a move from Costa Rica, he resigned from the directorate in early February.\n\nThe post-Sandinista government of Violeta Chamorro appointed Robelo to be ambassador to Costa Rica.

He then headed the Nicaraguan Development Institute, long active in the development of independent agricultural and small business cooperatives. Following the assassination of La Prensa editor Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, Robelo cofounded the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement, a social-democratic political party of businessmen, industrialists, and professionals opposed to the Somoza regime. A leader and main spokesman for FAO working openly against the Somoza regime, he was arrested and publicly labeled a \"subversive\" by Somoza. After the revolution Robelo was one of the five members of the original 1979 post-Somoza junta. Resigned in April 1980 because of the Marxist tendencies in the FSLN-dominated government and the growing Cuban influence in the country. Became President of the Democratic Coordinating Board. Harassed by the FSLN after his resignation from the junta and detained by the Sandinistas when he sought to travel abroad in 1982, he was finally forced into exile later that year, and his property was confiscated. In 1982, he joined with Edén Pastora and others in founding the ARDE, seeking to achieve the original democratic goals of the revolution. Robelo was elected to the Nicaraguan Resistance Directorate in May 1987. Resigned from the RN Directorate in January 1988.\n\nHe is a member of the Latino fraternity Phi Iota Alpha.

Lucien Fortabat was named Director of Azul's important French language school and later Director of the \"Banco Comercial\", which enabled his son, Alfredo, to attend the Sorbonne. The elder Fortabat died in 1921, however, and upon Alfredo's return in 1924, local cement kiln owners encouraged him to invest in the growing industry.\n\nThe 1926 discovery of large limestone deposits at the San Jacinto Estancia inherited from his father led Fortabat to open a cement factory in the nearby pampas hamlet of Loma Negra (south of Olavarría); the choice of location prompted him to christen the company \"Loma Negra\" (\"Black Mound\"). The cement plant was built in 1927, and Fortabat protected his venture in its early years partly by buying voting shares in competitors' boards.\n\nFortabat, whose marriage to Magdalena Corti Maderna ended in divorce, met a young Buenos Aires heiress, Amalia Lacroze, during a 1941 Teatro Colón function, and the two began a relationship. Planning to wed, they were impeded by Argentina's then-conservative nuptial laws, which precluded separated couples from remarrying. The marriage, which ultimately took place in neighboring Uruguay, became recognized in Argentina following a reform signed into law by President Juan Perón, in 1951. Mrs. Fortabat's gregariousness and knowledge of four foreign languages helped create a close business partnership as well as marriage, though it later suffered from a number of publicly reported infidelities.\n\nLoma Negra grew alongside the Argentine economy; by the early 1950s, the company produced 500,000 tons of cement annually and accounted for 70% of the cement sold to the Ministry of Public Works, for instance (his prominence as a building materials supplier during the Perón years triggered investigations against Loma Negra following the populist leader's 1955 overthrow, though charges were later dropped). New facilities in the Andes-range cities of San Juan and Zapala, opened during the 1960s, made Loma Negra the leader in cement and concrete production nationally. \n\nThe industrialist invested generously in employee housing and in 1930, established a largely self-contained community adjacent the cement works (\"Villa Alfredo Fortabat\"). The proprietor of 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres) of prime pampas land in his later years, he established the charitable Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat Foundation, in 1971.\n\nAlfredo Fortabat died in Buenos Aires on January 19, 1976, upon which his widow became the President and nearly sole owner of Loma Negra.\n"}

He received minimal education and upon the death of his father embarked on a career as an itinerant peddler, trekking across India and Australia before settling in East Africa.\n\nIn 1895, A.M. Jeevanjee of Karachi — as he was called at the time, was awarded the contract to supply the Imperial British East Africa Company with labour as they built the Kenya-Uganda Railway. He imported his workforce from the Gujarat region of British India. The first group to arrive had a total of 350 men and the number grew for the next six years to reach a total of 31,895. Most of the workforce were Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims who worked as skilled labourers, artisans, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, tailors, motor mechanics and electrical fitters.\n\nThe construction of the railway proved hugely profitable for Jevanjee and his newly set office in Mombasa ventured into other business interests in the region. His firm undertook contracts to build various government offices, railway stations and post offices all along the Mombasa-Kisumu railway. He further played a large role in the growth of Nairobi, supplying much capital to develop the town's infrastructure.\n\nWhen construction of the Kenya-Uganda Railway reached lake Victoria, Jeevanjee began taking an active role in political life, and launched the African Standard which was a weekly newspaper. He had hired an editor-reporter, W.H. Tiller whose work was to oversee the operations of the newspaper. In 1905, he sold the newspaper to two British businessmen who renamed it to East African Standard. Later in 1910 the paper became a daily newspaper and it moved its headquarters to Nairobi which was a fast developing commercial center.\n\nIn 1905, he was the first non-white appointed to represent the interests of the Indians in the Legislative Council (Legco) which was established that same year. He also established the East African Indian National Congress.\n\nHe started building the Jeevanjee Gardens in 1904 which he later donated to the people of Nairobi in 1906 as a place to relax. These gardens became the subject in the news headlines in 1991 where some leaders in authority were purporting to turn it into a commercial plot. There had been a proposed construction of a Multi-storey car park which was against the wish of Jeevanjee. The youngest remaining daughter of Jeevanjee, the late Shirin Najmudean moved to Nairobi to stop the planned development on the piece of land.\n\n\n"}

After brother Louis immigrated to America and earned enough money, he sent for Gaston and Arthur to join him. Once there, Arthur worked as an automotive mechanic and joined his brothers in auto racing. In 1911, he competed in the inaugural Indianapolis 500 but had to drop out after 30 laps when his Buick developed mechanical problems.\n\nIn 1916, the year after older brother Louis left the Chevrolet car company that he had co-founded, Arthur Chevrolet became a partner with Louis and Gaston in the new Frontenac Motor Corporation.\n\nDriving a Frontenac, Arthur qualified for the Indianapolis 500 again in 1916, but was forced out after 35 laps when the car developed ignition magneto problems. His driving career ended during practice rounds for the 1920 Indianapolis 500 when he was severely injured in a crash. Brother Gaston won that year's race in a Frontenac, but Gaston was killed in a California race a few months later.\n\nIn 1928, Arthur filed with the US Patent Office for an 'Overhead Valve Engine'. Patent #1,744,526 was awarded on January 21, 1930.\n\nIn 1929 Arthur and Louis Chevrolet left the auto business altogether to form the Chevrolet Brothers Aircraft Company with a new engine of their design (Chevrolair). The business was unsuccessful and was eventually taken over by investors. Arthur and Louis returned to automobiles, becoming pioneer leaders in the development of sprint type race cars. In 1990 Arthur and his brother were inducted to the inaugural class of the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum.\n\nIn 1942 Arthur Chevrolet retired to Slidell, Louisiana. Suffering from depression, he committed suicide by hanging in 1946, only nine days shy of his 62nd birthday.\n\nArthur Chevrolet has long been thought to be interred next to his brothers in the Holy Cross and Saint Joseph Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana. A headstone was placed at the grave in 2011 to memorialize his life by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chevrolet Motor Company. The \"St. Tammany News\" (which ceased operations in early 2013) revealed in a series of articles in late August 2012 that Arthur was not buried in Holy Cross and St. Joseph Cemetery as previously believed but is most likely in a lost and unmarked grave in Our Lady of Lourdes Cemetery in the city where he died, Slidell, Louisiana. The grave thought to be that of Arthur Chevrolet for many years is in fact his son, Arthur Chevrolet Jr. who died at 23 years old in November 1931, 15 years prior to Arthur Sr. death. The actual location of Arthur Chevrolet, Sr. grave is yet to be known as of this date.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39611286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39611286", "title": "Criminal syndicalism", "text": "Criminal syndicalism\n\nCriminal syndicalism has been defined as a doctrine of criminal acts for political, industrial, and social change. These criminal acts include advocation of crime, sabotage, violence, and other unlawful methods of terrorism. Criminal syndicalism laws were enacted to oppose economic radicalism.\n\nIdaho legislation defines it as, “the doctrine which advocates crime, sabotage, violence, or other unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform”.\n\nKey terms in criminal syndicalism statutes had vague definitions.\n\nCriminal syndicalism became a matter of public attention during and after the World War I period, and has been used to stymie the efforts of radical labor movements.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the public was hostile towards leftist ideologies and deemed social radicalism un-American. Government officials on the state and federal level ordered arrests, imprisonments and killings of people who challenged industrial capitalism or made militant demands under the pre-existing economic structure.\n\nBy the year 1933, over 700 convictions of criminal syndicalism were made. Organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union believe laws on criminal syndicalism were aimed to punish doctrines or memberships in unions.\n\nCriminal Syndicalism laws were enacted to combat the efforts of radical labor unions. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) is one such union in particular. Defining the labor efforts as criminal allowed for the government to stop the Wobblies' activities and the labor problem of World War I and post World War I altogether. Senator W.G. Walker of Idaho, the nation’s first state to enact a criminal syndicalism law, introduced the criminal syndicalism legislation to the Senate with an anti-IWW speech.\n\nThe IWW’s confrontational rhetoric factored into public concerns. The organization used “sabotages” and military tactics in its invocation of social change. The public assumed the IWW promoted violence and destruction of properties even though the IWW did not share these intentions. The IWW’s later attempts at reducing enforcement efforts through distancing itself from this doctrine were unsuccessful.\n\nThe IWW’s opposition to United States’ involvement in World War I was in contrast of public sentiment, leading to an unfavorable public opinion towards the organization.\n\nPatriotic societies alleged that German gold financed IWW operations, and that the organization received support from hostile nations.\n\nThe red scare exacerbated public distrust and fear against all radical leftist organizations, including the IWW. Strikes (involving over 4 million workers) across the nation increased negative sentiments against these organizations.\nVarious bombings and bombing plots attributed to radical leftists caused the public to view radical leftist organizations as threats to state security.\nWhile repressions against the IWW through government actions and vigilantism were rampant, the public continued to perceive efforts to suppress the organization as insufficient.\n\nThe defense by the IWW's General Defense Committee in the case of Fiske v. Kansas resulted in a critically important 1924 Supreme Court ruling which led to the decline of criminal syndicalism laws as a factor in legislative anti-union initiatives.\n\nState government legislation has been made to address criminal syndicalism according to their own definitions. States enacted criminal laws, the first of which was enacted in Idaho in 1917, or sedition law (operating basically in the same way as criminal syndicalism laws).\n\nDuring World War I and post-World War I, more than half the states passed these anti-radical statutes, most of which still remain in effect today.\n\nBy 1935, there were a number of 33 states with remaining criminal syndicalism laws or sedition laws. Between the years 1918 and 1919 Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, and fourteen other states passed criminal syndicalism laws and between 1917 and 1923 thirteen states enacted sedition laws. Those states without Criminal Syndicalism laws or sedition laws during this period are noted to have had some similar already existing statutes against incitement and rebellion.\n\nThe degree of the consequences range from state to state. Criminal Syndicalism laws called for maximum fines of $10,000 and a maximum 25-year prison sentence. Prosecutions under Criminal syndicalism laws ensued. The California Criminal Syndicalism Act of 1919 alone, only five years after its enactment, was responsible for over 500 arrests and 164 convictions.\n\nThis act was upheld by the United States Supreme Court on May 16, 1927 in the \"Whitney v. California\" case. The power of law against criminal syndicalism began to falter by the 1930s as the courts began to overturn convictions as either being no true threat to the US or by declaring the laws to be too vague or broad. One such example was the court's overturning of the conviction of Dirk DeJonge due to protesting the police brutality in the longshoreman’s strike, as violating Oregon's criminal syndicalism law.\n\nOn February 19, 1917, the criminal syndicalism bill was introduced into the Idaho state legislature.\n\nBusinesses which stood to lose the most at the hands of the IWW, including lumber and mining interests, lobbied for the statute’s enactment. In March 1917, the Idaho state government enacted the statute. The Idaho criminal syndicalism bill served as a prototype for many other similar bills passed in various state legislatures in the following four years.\n\nInitially, the rhetoric behind criminal syndicalism laws appealed strictly to business interests. After the United States entered the World War I, then Governor of Idaho Moses Alexander instilled nationalist rhetoric into the public discourse of the law while referring to the IWW’s opposition against United States’ participation in the war.\n\nIn 1925, the Idaho legislature enacted a bill which outlawed non-violent attempts of sabotage; \"work done in an improper manner, slack work, waste of property, and loitering at work\" became illegal acts. Organized labor opposed the amendment because the expanded definition of sabotage might be applied against recognized trade union practices.\n\nSeveral Supreme Court rulings later limited the applicability of criminal syndicalism laws in Idaho, and criminal syndicalism laws in Idaho became a dead issue.\n\nCriminal syndicalism in California was defined as \"any doctrine or precept advocating . . . the commission of crime, sabotage . . . or unlawful acts of force and violence . . . as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial ownership or control, or effecting any political change.” \nKnowingly associating oneself with a group which advocates, teaches, or aids and abed criminal syndicalism could also lead to criminal liability under the California statute.\n\nViolators could be punished by up to fourteen years in jail.\n\nThe bill’s enactment came after a series of events undermining IWW’s public image.\n\nOn July 22, 1916, a bomb exploded in the Preparedness Day parade in San Francisco. It led to the arrests of Warren K Billings and Thomas Mooney – both of whom were associated with militant labor movement – and two others. The San Francisco public responded with an uproar.\n\nFresno and Riverside agricultural strikes took place in 1917, months preceding the California criminal syndicalism bill’s first introduction.\n\nThe first attempt of inducting the criminal syndicalism bill into the California law took place in 1917. The bill was a copy of the Idaho statute. Legislators found the term “sabotage” in the bill ambiguous and did not pass the bill.\n\nIn the same year, the federal government increased crackdowns against IWW on suspicion of the organization’s financial ties with foreign hostiles. The Department of Justice conducted raids on IWW headquarters across the country, including bases in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Fresno.\n\nIn addition to the protests, IWW was accused of sabotaging Fresno famers by burning hay stacks and covering raisins with dirt. The Department of Justice opened its Fresno branch in response. California State Federation of Labor also issued a condemnation of IWW. These events coincided with the bombing of the governor’s residence at Sacramento, which led to arrests of IWW members. The press began to pose a negative attitude towards IWW.\n\nFrom 1917-19, tension between capital and labor grew. Strikes and IWW activities in key wartime industries increased. The California public invoked a patriotic sentiment and saw IWW as an enemy.\n\nIn January 1919, Senator William Kehoe made the second introduction of the criminal syndicalism bill in California. The introduction came five days after the trial of the Governor’s residence bombing, possibly to drown out opposition to the bill.\n\nGovernor William Stephens recommended measures to check IWW propaganda in the bill. Legislators included his proposed amendment in the final bill.\n\nThe proposed bill would outlaw labor organization which conduct strikes or boycotts with the intent of changing industrial ownership and control or causing any political change.\n\nRepresentatives of organized labor, while supportive of the bill’s intent to reduce IWW influences, believed the bill could be used to imprison labor leaders should strikes or boycotts be used in industrial disputes. Labor leaders proposed an amendment which defined the punishable offense more definitely. The amendment failed to pass.\n\nGovernor Stephens signed the bill containing his proposed clause into law on April 30, 1919.\n\nThe defense by the IWW's General Defense Committee in the case of Fiske v. Kansas resulted in a critically important 1924 Supreme Court ruling which led to the decline of criminal syndicalism laws as a factor in legislative anti-union initiatives.\n\nIn 1924, Kansas' state criminal syndicalism law was challenged by a Supreme Court ruling in the case of Fiske v. Kansas, which would become critically important in the future of legal battles over freedom of speech, and which was an early case supported by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ruling overturned the conviction of Harold B. Fiske, an organizer affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World's Agricultural Workers Industrial Union.\n\nThe states who still have criminal syndicalism statutes in 2013 are:\n\nMoreover, \n\nSome argued that criminal syndicalism laws violated the United States Constitution.\n\nIn \"Whitney v. California\", 274 U.S. 357 (1927), the Supreme Court held that California's law suppressing speech advocating criminal acts against the state did not violate the right to freedom of speech as enumerated in the First Amendment, since it encouraged a bad tendency in listeners.\n\nHowever, that holding \"Whitney\" was overturned in \"Brandenburg v.

{"id": "3218783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3218783", "title": "Drug development", "text": "Drug development\n\nDrug development is the process of bringing a new pharmaceutical drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery. It includes pre-clinical research on microorganisms and animals, filing for regulatory status, such as via the United States Food and Drug Administration for an investigational new drug to initiate clinical trials on humans, and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval with a new drug application to market the drug.\n\nBroadly, the process of drug development can be divided into pre-clinical and clinical work.\n\nNew chemical entities (NCEs, also known as new molecular entities or NMEs) are compounds that emerge from the process of drug discovery. These have promising activity against a particular biological target that is important in disease. However, little is known about the safety, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of this NCE in humans. It is the function of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"first-in-man\" [FIM] or First Human Dose [FHD]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the physicochemical properties of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a medicinal chemist producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and ton scale. They further examine the product for suitability to package as capsules, tablets, aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or intravenous formulations. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as \"chemistry, manufacturing, and control\" (CMC).\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the regulatory requirements of drug licensing authorities. These generally constitute a number of tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans. It is a legal requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new drug is to be delivered through the skin). Increasingly, these tests are made using \"in vitro\" methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.\n\nThe information is gathered from this pre-clinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the FDA), as an Investigational New Drug application or IND. If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase.\n\nClinical trials involve three or four steps:\n\nThe process of defining characteristics of the drug does not stop once an NCE begins human clinical trials. In addition to the tests required to move a novel drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others). They must also test the compound for its potential to cause cancer (carcinogenicity testing).\n\nIf a compound emerges from these tests with an acceptable toxicity and safety profile, and the company can further show it has the desired effect in clinical trials, then the NCE portfolio of evidence can be submitted for marketing approval in the various countries where the manufacturer plans to sell it. In the United States, this process is called a \"new drug application\" or NDA.\n\nMost NCEs fail during drug development, either because they have unacceptable toxicity or because they simply do not have the intended effect on the targeted disease as shown in clinical trials.\n\nA trend toward the collection of biomarker and genetic information from clinical trial participants, and increasing investment by companies in this area, led by 2018 to fully half of all drug trials collecting this information, the prevalence reaching above 80% among oncology trials.\n\nThe full cost of bringing a new drug (i.e., new chemical entity) to market – from discovery through clinical trials to approval – is complex and controversial. Typically, companies spend tens to hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars. One element of the complexity is that the much-publicized final numbers often not only include the out-of-pocket expenses for conducting a series of Phase I-III clinical trials, but also the \"capital costs\" of the long period (10 or more years) during which the company must cover out-of-pocket costs for preclinical drug discovery. Additionally, companies often do not report whether a given figure includes the capitalized cost or comprises only out-of-pocket expenses, or both.\n\nAnother element of complexity is that all estimates are based on confidential information controlled by drug companies, released by them voluntarily, leading to inability to verify costs. The numbers are controversial, as drug companies use them to justify the prices of their drugs and various advocates for lower drug prices have challenged them. The controversy is not only between \"high\" and \"low\", but also the high numbers may vary considerably for the manifold factors in drug development.\n\nOne study assessed both capitalized and out-of-pocket costs for bringing a single new drug to market as about US$1.8 billion and $870 million, respectively.\n\nIn an analysis of the drug development costs for 98 companies over a decade, the average cost per drug developed and approved by a single-drug company was $350 million. But for companies that approved between eight and 13 drugs over 10 years, the cost per drug went as high as $5.5 billion, due mainly to geographic expansion for marketing and ongoing costs for Phase IV trials and continuous monitoring for safety.\n\nAlternatives to conventional drug development have the objective for universities, governments and pharmaceutical industry to collaborate and optimize resources.\n\nThe nature of a drug development project is characterised by high attrition rates, large capital expenditures, and long timelines. This makes the valuation of such projects and companies a challenging task. Not all valuation methods can cope with these particularities. The most commonly used valuation methods are risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV), decision trees, real options, or comparables.\n\nThe most important value drivers are the cost of capital or discount rate that is used, phase attributes such as duration, success rates, and costs, and the forecasted sales, including cost of goods and marketing and sales expenses. Less objective aspects like quality of the management or novelty of the technology should be reflected in the cash flows estimation.\n\nCandidates for a new drug to treat a disease might, theoretically, include from 5,000 to 10,000 chemical compounds. On average about 250 of these show sufficient promise for further evaluation using laboratory tests, mice and other test animals. Typically, about ten of these qualify for tests on humans. A study conducted by the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development covering the 1980s and 1990s found that only 21.5 percent of drugs that started Phase I trials were eventually approved for marketing. In the time period of 2006 to 2015, the success rate was 9.6%. The high failure rates associated with pharmaceutical development are referred to as the \"attrition rate\" problem. Careful decision making during drug development is essential to avoid costly failures. In many cases, intelligent programme and clinical trial design can prevent false negative results. Well-designed, dose-finding studies and comparisons against both a placebo and a gold-standard treatment arm play a major role in achieving reliable data.\n\nNovel initiatives include partnering between governmental organizations and industry. The world's largest such initiative is the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), and examples of major national initiatives are Top Institute Pharma in the Netherlands and Biopeople in Denmark. In 2004, the FDA created the “Critical Path Initiative” to guide the new drug development process.\n\n\n"}

He is the founder of Erber KG, later known as Biomin GmbH; the animal health and nutrition company specializes in feed additives and premixes. It continues to be family-owned and operated.\n\nErich Erber was born on April 30, 1953 in Sankt Pölten, the capital of the state of Lower Austria, and was raised on a small farm in the Mostviertel region. \n\nHe studied agriculture at the Francisco Josephinum Secondary College and Research Institute, obtaining the equivalent of a high school diploma in 1975. \n\nFrom 1976-1978, Erich Erber worked as an Operations assistant at Kettaneh Pt Ltd, located in Accra, Ghana. He was involved in the production of construction materials. At the same time, he acquired expertise in the field of international trade while majoring in export sales at the Vienna University of Economics and Business from 1978-1980. Concurrently, he began to study macroeconomics at the University of Vienna (without obtaining a degree). From 1980 - 1982, he was the Head of Sales at Chemagrar, a subsidiary of Werfft Chemie, which specializes in feed additives for the Central European compound feed industry. \n\nHe received his MBA, with a focus on strategic marketing, from the University of Hull in Singapore.\n\nIn 1983, Erich Erber and Margarete Erber founded Biomin GmbH together in Pottenbrunn, Lower Austria. The company’s first products were developed in a former slaughterhouse. \nIt continues to be family-owned and operated.\n\nBiomin GmbH acquired Interpremix, a company with its own tank mixer and the product Antitox Plus, in 1985. Following extensive research, the product was developed further under the name Mycofix and subsequently became a global benchmark product. \n\nOne year later, it was exported to Asia for the first time. In 1988, Biomin GmbH concluded a research agreement with the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Its goal was to continue to improve Antitox Plus’s effectiveness in deactivating a wide variety of mycotoxins. \n\nIn 1992, Erich Erber founded Biomin’s first subsidiary with a local partner in Kuala Lumpur. In later years, additional subsidiaries were created abroad: examples include the first Biomin production site in Vietnam in 1995 and regional headquarters which opened in Singapore and the U.S. in 1997. In 1996, Erber AG was also founded as an unlisted public company; it was a holding company for the two group members at the time as well as for all future organizations. \n\nBy creating an interdisciplinary in-house research team, Erich Erber established another forward-thinking milestone. Research and development have been part of Biomin’s key cornerstones ever since. \n\nThe next step on his path to success took place when he acquired Romer Labs Missouri in 1999. In doing so, he was able to develop a business segment that was completely new: diagnostics in the field of feed and food safety. Romer Labs thus became the second division of Erber Group.\n\nIn 2004, Erich Erber created the Biomin World Nutrition Forum, with the goal of actively involving customers and promoting trust in the organization. Scientists, customers and managers come together to exchange ideas regarding current developments. \nIt takes place once every two years, with approximately 800 participants (event organizers, keynote speakers, etc.). \n\nIn 2005, Mr. Erber took additional steps to ensure the group’s development by opening the first Biomin Center of Applied Animal Nutrition. \n\nErber Group’s third and fourth divisions joined in 2007:\nSanphar, a Brazilian company specializing in animal health, and EFB. EFB, together with the subsidiary Bio-ferm, focuses on innovative biotechnological pesticides and their research, international registration and marketing. \n\nThe construction of a state-of-the-art yeast fermentation facility in Brazil has been the group’s largest investment thus far; it became operational in 2010. This site makes direct shipments to regional markets possible. \n\nErber Group sees itself as an organization of experts and is the global market leader in mycotoxin risk management, its original core business. \n\nThe high-performance research and development within the group provides a basis for the development of customer-oriented and innovative solutions. This is made possible, in particular, by cooperating with renowned universities and research centers on various projects. \n\nErber Group is now one of the global leaders in the field of food and feed safety. Headquartered in Getzersdorf, Lower Austria, it specializes in natural feed additives, feed and food analyses as well as plant protection. In the 2017 financial year, it generated sales revenues of over 325 million Euros. Erber Group consists of Biomin, Romer Labs, Sanphar and EFB. Including its sales partners, it is represented in over 120 countries. Erber Group’s annual growth can be attributed to two important success factors: the group’s international orientation and its internal research and development. \n\nToday, Erich Erber is the main stockholder and chairman of the Erber AG advisory board. The Erber family owns all of the companies' stocks; they are not traded on any stock market.\n\nIn 2012, Erich Erber was awarded the title of “honorary consul” for his long-term cooperation with BOKU, the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna. \n\nErnst & Young designated him as “Entrepreneur Of The Year” in 2014; in 2015 he received the “Expat of the Year Award” from the Foreign Trade Organization (AWO) of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (WKO) . Furthermore, in 2015 he received an honorary PhD from Kasetsart University in Bangkok. \n\nOn June 21, 2016, Erich Erber was awarded the “Silver Commanders’ Cross for Recognition of Services on Behalf of the State of Lower Austria” by the Governor of Lower Austria, Erwin Pröll, during a ceremony in the Lower Austrian Parliament. In doing so, the state of Lower Austria recognizes Mr. Erber’s contributions and achievements as the founder and co-owner of Erber AG, which has been his raison d'être for more than 30 years. \n\nIn July 2017, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EBD) appointed him as the “Economic Ambassador of Singapore” for medium-sized companies. \n\n"}

The process relies on aligning the correct method to the correct scenario\".\n\nFocused improvement was developed as a working part of the Theory of Constraints management philosophy by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his 1984 book titled \"The Goal\", that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals. Unlike other popular performance improvement methods, such as TQM or reengineering, F.I. focuses on solving real life problems and not on increasing the costs and distractions for the management's attention.\n\nNo general agreement has been reached about the characteristics of F.I. or TQM but to some extent we can observe similar traits in implementations of these processes.\n\n\nThese two philosophies have the same main goal but they go about achieving it two different ways. The Fi delivers short term results that can be translated into long term success if the process is repeated correctly without allowing it to lose momentum. The TQM has at its base client satisfaction but it only yields long term results. When choosing one of these two processes management has to take into account what are the company needs.\n\nProducts that are based on embedded computer systems has seen a rapid increase.

The working principle of the five thinking processes is represented by the users ability to answer the following questions:\nIf all questions have an answer then the Focused improvement can be applied with relative ease\n\n\"Focused improvement includes all activities that maximize the overall effectiveness of equipment, processes, and plants through uncompromising elimination of losses* and improvement of performance.\"\n\nThe objective of Focused Improvement is to assure that the equipment maintains a peak performance all the time.\n\n\"The fact is machines do virtually 100 percent of the product manufacturing work.

The better our machines run, the more productive our shop floor, and the more successful our business.\"\n\nThe driving concept behind Focused Improvement is bringing your losses as close to zero as possible.\n\n\"Maximizing equipment effectiveness requires the complete elimination of failures, defects, and other negative phenomena – in other words, the wastes and losses incurred in equipment operation.\"\n"}

The institute was established on July 1, 1961 to regulate the profession of accountancy in Pakistan. It is a statutory autonomous body established under the Chartered Accountants Ordinance 1961. With the significant growth in the profession, the CA Ordinance and Bye-Laws were revised in 1983.\n\nIn view of globalization of the accountancy profession, the Institute is in the process of updating the Ordinance and Bye-Laws once again.\n\nThe course of ICAP involves a blend of theoretical education and practical training which run concurrently for a period of 3.5 years and equips a student with knowledge, ability, skills and other qualities required of a professional accountant.\n\nThe head office of the institute is in Clifton, Karachi where it has its own premises. The institute also has regional offices at Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, Multan, Gujranwala, Sukkur, Quetta, Mirpur (AJK), Faisalabad and Hyderabad.\n\nIn Indian subcontinent there were a few British firms of accountants, but they were so busy that their services were not available to the general public. The public companies used to appoint a European auditor for safeguarding the interests of the European shareholders, and an Indian auditor with the objectives of safeguarding the interests of the Indian shareholders. The audit of financial statements were conducted under the Companies Act 1850.\n\nThen the Companies Act of 1885 was passed. Regulations 83–94 of Table A contained in the First Schedule provided for the audit of accounts of the companies adopting that table and for the appointment, remuneration and duties of the auditors. In those times, it was not necessary for an auditor to be a qualified accountant. Companies used to employ lawyers as their auditors.\n\nOn 1 April 1914, the Companies Act, 1913 was passed and it was necessitated that every auditor of a public limited company must be a certified auditor by the government. The provincial governments were empowered to grant auditors' certificates but, at the same time, the central government also reserved the right to recognise members of certain professional bodies as qualified auditors without obtaining Auditor's Certificate from the government. Consequently, the members of the English, Scottish and Irish Institutes of Chartered Accountants and the English Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors were recognised as qualified auditors.\n\nAt that time there was no provision of any kind for the training and examination of the accountants. Government of Bombay was the first provincial government to take a constructive step in the direction of organising the profession. In 1918, it instituted the Government Diploma in Accountancy called GDA and made regulations for the examination and training of those who wanted to obtain that Diploma and certificate to practise.\n\nAn Accountancy Board was set up by the Government and was attached to the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics, Bombay. This functioned till 1932. The Board was required to register apprenticeships and conduct the required examinations. The successful candidates were granted the GDA Diploma and they could practise if they had previously received training as apprentices with a practising accountant. The Accountancy Board was also required to advise the Government on all matters relating to accountancy and the Government.\n\nIn 1932, the Government framed rules under Section 144 of the companies Act, 1913, called Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1932. The objectives of the rules, broadly, were to register apprenticeships, to conduct examinations, and to control and regulate the profession of auditing. The accountancy profession was then being supervised and controlled by the Ministry of Commerce of the Central Government. With a view to helping the Government in discharging the necessary responsibilities in respect of the accountancy profession, Indian Accountancy Board was established. The Board consisted of officials and practising accountants nominated by the Government. Later, in 1939, appointment of a majority of the members on the Board was made on the elective principle. The Board was only an advisory body. The Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1932, required the passing of two examinations – Registered Accountants first and final. It further laid down the tenure of the prescribed training which was required to be completed during the period of apprenticeship. Provisions meant to regulate and control the profession were also contained therein.\n\nAfter independence, Pakistan adopted the Auditors' Certificates Rules 1932 with certain amendments in 1950, and thus the auditing profession was administered under the Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1950. The Rules of 1950 were generally based on the old rules with some amendments incorporated therein. A person who passed the Registered Accountants first and final examinations and who satisfied the Ministry of Commerce, Central Government of Pakistan that he had completed the prescribed practical training could have his name placed on the register maintained by the said Ministry and was entitled to use the designation 'Registered Accountant' (RA). The Companies Act, 1913, as adapted by Pakistan allowed only a Registered Accountant to act as the auditor of a public limited company, although his services could also be utilised for the audit of private companies, partnership, etc.\n\nIn 1952, the Registered Accountants formed a private body known as 'Pakistan Institute of Accountants' with the object of looking after their own interest and taking up with the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan, matters affecting the accountancy profession.\n\nIn June 1959 the Department of Accountancy was established in the Ministry of Commerce with a Controller of Accountancy to deal with the profession instead of a Section Officer.\n\nDuring this period, an advisory body called the 'Council of Accountancy' was set up under Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1950 and recommended the establishment of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Pakistan. The Government accepted the recommendations and the Department of Accountancy assisted by the officials of the Institute and a number of its members prepared the Draft Ordinance to be passed.\n\nThe Chartered Accountants Ordinance, 1961, received the assent of the President of Pakistan, Field Marshal General Ayub Khan on March 3, 1961 and was published in Part 1 of the Extraordinary Gazette of Pakistan on March 10, 1961. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan came into being on July 1, 1961. A draft of the Chartered Accountants Bye-Laws was also prepared and published for inviting public comments. The amended version called the Chartered Accountants Bye-Laws, 1961 was published in the Part 1 of the Extraordinary Gazette of Pakistan on July 1, 1961 and was enforced as on that date. As of that date the Department of Accountancy and the Pakistan Institute of Accountants having served a very useful purpose for a long time were finally liquidated.\n\nThe Chartered Accountants Bye-Laws provided for the formation of regional committees to look after the interests of their members. The members are divided into two classes – namely, Associate Chartered Accountants (ACA) and Fellow Chartered Accountants (FCA).\n\nIn December 1984, the Companies Act, 1913 was replaced by the Companies Ordinance, 1984 with an order by the President of Pakistan General Zia-ul-haq. With this Ordinance, it was also necessitated for the manufacturing concern to prepare and maintain cost accounting records and to arrange\ncost audit on annual basis by a Chartered Accountant or a Cost and Management Accountant. It also lays down the requirements for the preparation of financial statements of unlisted companies. For listed companies the above Ordinance also made mandatory the National Accounting Standards (NAS) and other standards to be strictly followed while preparing financial statements.\n\nKeeping in view the convergence, undergone by the major economies of the world such as United States of America, China and Canada, of the International Financial Reporting Standards with respective local GAAP, the demand for IFRS specialists is increasing. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) has introduced a diploma in IFRS to prepare the candidates to avail such opportunities.\n\nPast Presidents till present are as follow;\nThe member statistics till 2010 are as follows;\nFive year Statistical Data of Members\n\nThe Institute provides students the login tab on its website. The Institute committed to regulate the education, training and examination of its students in order to ensure that a newly qualified Chartered Accountant can continue to be confidently regarded as:\n\n\nFrom 1994 a Pre-entry Proficiency Test (PPT) was introduced to determine the suitability of candidates before being registered as Trainee Students/Full Time Students. PPT was mandatory for all entrants except those who were exempt from PPT but later when new policy was introduced in 2014, it was completely excluded from the course.\n\nThe publications of the Institute are:\n\nThe Pakistan Accountant is the professional flagship publication of the Institute. It is intended to serve as a forum for disseminating information on auditing and accounting practices, business and finance, and topics of current national and international interest.\n\nThe Newsletter is designed to provide a heads-up on important Institute events and activities. The Pakistan Accountant and the Newsletter have received a makeover this past year to boost the Institute’s professional image, and to serve as a channel for staying in touch with our most valuable assets – our members and students.\n\nThrough the Members Information & Education Series (MIES) the Institute hopes to promote the integration of best practices and sound judgment among members.\n\nThese publications form the body of literature that fosters the Institute’s policy of promoting education and research.\n\nThe ICAP is a member of International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA) and South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA). ICAP was awarded associate membership by Chartered Accountants Worldwide (CAW), making it the second professional body to be admitted to the organisation since its launch in February 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46245834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46245834", "title": "John Beveridge (mayor)", "text": "John Beveridge (mayor)\n\nJohn Beveridge, JP (8 August 184815 March 1916) was a New South Wales businessman, sportsman and local government politician, who served as an Alderman (1886–1891) and Mayor of Redfern (1891).\n\nBeveridge was born 8 August 1848 in the town of Windsor, Colony of New South Wales. He was the son of John Beveridge, a baker and confectioner, and Jane Greig, who as assisted migrants had emigrated from Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, to Sydney on 16 January 1839. At the age of 19, Beveridge entered the mercantile firm of \"George Griffiths and Co.\" in 1867. On 8 August 1871 he was married to Priscilla Wright, the Anglo-Irish daughter of teacher and later principal of the Fort Street Training School John Wright (1822–1887), at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, by the Rev. Robert Lewers. Beveridge and his wife Priscilla had seven children: John Stuart (1872–1874), Percy (1875–1947), Mabel (1878–1955), Harry (1882–1943), Violet (1886–1975), Cecil (1888–1946) and Roy Stuart (1893–1916). In 1880 he was made a partner in the firm, and on the retirement of Griffiths became the owner, which specialised in \"wholesale grocery and general merchandise\" from its premises on the corner of Bridge and Young streets, Sydney.\n\nA prominent member of the flourishing business community in Sydney and Redfern, Beveridge became involved as a member of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce and as a director of the Mortgage, Guarantee and Mercantile Finance Corporation of New South Wales, the Sydney Real Estate Bank and the Australian Traders' Fire Insurance Company. Beveridge also became a member of the Redfern Branch of the Free Trade Association. A keen sportsman, Beveridge was a member of the Cricket Union (vice-president in 1889) and was instrumental in the development of the Surry United Cricket Club, being captain from 1879 (now the Surry Hills Cricket Club).\n\nBeveridge eventually stood for office as a free trader and became an alderman unopposed on Redfern Municipal Council for Belmore Ward on 20 September 1886, filling a vacancy created by the departure of Alderman Francis Augustus Wright, and was re-elected in February 1888. In September 1888 he presided over a meeting at Redfern Town Hall to support the ultimately-unsuccessful candidacy of free trader John Martin for a by-election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Redfern; the meeting was attended by Sir Henry Parkes who also spoke in support.\n\nBeveridge strongly aligned himself with the politics of Parkes and later stood for the seat of Redfern himself as a Free Trade candidate at the 1889 colonial election, but was unsuccessful, missing out by a margin of over 100 votes, despite the overall success of the Free Trade movement at that election, with Parkes forming government. Even so, on 12 June 1890 he was appointed to the Redfern Sub-District Public School Board by the Governor Lord Carrington, on the advice of Free Trader Minister for Public Instruction, Joseph Carruthers.\n\nOn 12 February 1891 Beveridge was elected to be mayor of the council and was instrumental in making Redfern the first suburb in Sydney to have electricity and electric street lighting, which occurred when the Council voted unanimously in 1891, following the recommendations of the improvements committee, to build its own power station in Turner Street to power the suburb. Beveridge then proposed and passed through council a loan of £50,000 for the purpose. This movement by the council was later affirmed and protected by the Parliament of New South Wales when it passed the \"Borough of Redfern Electric Lighting Act 1895\".\n\nHowever, by May 1891 Beveridge had resigned as mayor and an alderman for Redfern prior to his candidacy for the 1891 election. His vacancy in Belmore Ward was subsequently filled by William Poole. Beveridge stood again as a Free Trade candidate for Redfern, reaffirming his support for the Free Trade vision for Australian Federation and noting that overall wages in New South Wales were higher compared to Victoria and taxation was lower owing to the Free Trade system in NSW, a system \"that is best for the commercial interests of the colony.\" Beveridge was however again unsuccessful at the June election which saw the Free Traders lose out to the Labor Party and the Protectionists.\n\nFollowing this defeat, Beveridge returned to business, taking up a high-ranking position in the Sydney office of the New York Life Insurance Company. On 25 November 1891, Beveridge sold his merchandise business, \"George Griffiths and Co.\" to David Cohen and Company. Beveridge nevertheless retained his keen interest in the Free Trade movement and in politics generally, including presiding over the election committee for John Neild's unsuccessful bid for the seat of Woollahra at the 1894 election (he lost to Adrian Knox, standing as an 'Independent Free Trade' candidate). George Reid's Free traders were successful at that election and Beveridge, in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald, noted: \"the vote of last Tuesday must inspire every thinking man in the community with the idea that the people are ripe for the establishment of a progressive policy, and I believe Mr Reid is the man for the hour.\"\n\nBy 1896, Beveridge had opened his own retail business in the rural and mining town of Lithgow and involved himself in various community activities, including in cricket. Reporting on his attendance at a Lithgow reception for Premier Reid in May 1896, the \"Windsor and Richmond Gazette\" noted: \"no doubt, ere long Mr. [Beveridge] will take a leading part in matters connected with the welfare of the town, for he is too good a man to be allowed to stay long in clover. His ability is already recognised in his new home, and a matter of a few months will decide whether he enters the Municipal arena or not. If he does, Lithgow will be the gainer.\" In early 1896 Beveridge nominated to take up a vacancy on Lithgow Ward on Lithgow Municipal Council, but received only 6 votes. The next year he stood again for Lithgow Ward but lost by one vote. Beveridge became heavily involved in local cricket circles, donating the \"Beveridge Cup\" for district matches, and becoming President of the Lithgow District Cricket Association in 1899; the patron of the association that year was prominent local politician Joseph Cook.\n\nA supporter of Australian Federation, Beveridge was nominated to attend the People's Federal Convention at Bathurst in November 1896, which had convened to discuss the 1891 draft Constitution being proposed for the Commonwealth of Australia. The most important recommendation made by the convention was that the Senate should be directly-elected. In December 1897, Beveridge established the Lithgow Land, Building, and Investment Company and became a company director. As a longstanding Justice of the Peace, on 23 January 1899 Beveridge was appointed by Governor Lord Hampden, on the recommendation of Minister for Justice Charles Lee, as Coroner for Lithgow and for the colony at large.\n\nBy 1901, Beveridge had moved again to the Riverina town of Hay, and opened his own general merchandise store, \"Beveridge & Co.\", in the town. It was not long before Beveridge again returned to Cricketing circles, gaining much respect in the Hay Cricket Association, later serving as vice-president, and rising to be President of the Hay Chamber of Commerce in 1901. In February 1901, Beveridge was elected as Honorary Secretary at the inaugural meeting of the Hay Free Trade Association and later assisting in the campaign of Free Trade candidate James Ashton for the seat of Riverina at the first federal election a month later.\nIn May 1902 Beveridge departed Hay for a visit to London for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.\n\nAfter moving back to Sydney with his family, in later years he served as the general manager of the Merchants' and Traders' Employment Bureau, which his brother Peter had purchased in July 1908. The Bureau's offices were sited within the New York Mutual Life Building at 14 Martin Place, Sydney. Beveridge moved with his family to a new residence, \"Violet\" in Balfour Road, Kensington, but in later years his health suffered greatly owing to \"acute heart trouble\", which led to his death aged 67 on 15 March 1916. His youngest son Lance sergeant Roy Stuart Beveridge (20th Battalion) was later killed in action following the Battle of Flers in France on 12 November 1916. His eldest son Percy Beveridge became a notable cricketer in New Zealand, while his son Cecil became an actor and theatre director and, also of the 20th Battalion, was injured during the Battle of Pozières in 1916. He is interred with his wife (d. 1929) and his third son, Harry (d. 1943, who was a branch manager for the Commonwealth Bank) at Waverley Cemetery.\n"}

Vergara is a billionaire \nwith a net worth of approximately $1.5 billion. He is the founder of Grupo Omnilife, one of the top 200 corporations in Mexico. \nIn addition to its health products business, Grupo Omnilife owns the football clubs Club Deportivo Guadalajara and Chivas Hefei, including a fleet of private jets and real estate.\n\nVergara has also produced internationally recognized films such as \"The Assassination of Richard Nixon\" and the Oscar-nominated \"Y tu mamá también\" through the production company, Producciones Anhelo.\n\nBorn in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Vergara once sold tacos on Mexican streets. Back in the 1980s Vergara sold condominiums and timeshares in Manzanillo, Mexico, where he met and began working with John Peterson.\n\nWhen Peterson became a Herbalife salesperson, he recruited Vergara and together they began selling Herbalife products in Mexico. Since Herbalife had not received Mexican government approval to sell their products, Peterson and Vergara had to smuggle the products into the country. After six months of smuggling the products into Mexico, Herbalife took notice and began the process of getting government approval. Vergara was asked to help get the Herbalife products approved by the Mexican government and was instrumental in helping Herbalife's founder, Mark Hughes deal with the Mexican Government. This gave Vergara insight into how a multi-level company profits and expands into other countries. Vergara was partners with Roger Daley, Jim Fobair and Charlie Ragus. With already the 51% of the company, Vergara acquired the rest of Omnitrition at the end of the deal with his U.S. partners and took the whole control of Omnitrition de Mexico. Since its foundation in 1991, the privately owned corporation has grown from one company, Omnilife de Mexico, to comprise nineteen companies. Today, approximately 5.2 million people distribute Omnilife products in 22 countries, while the company has reached annual sales of nearly $4.2 billion.\n\nVergara has been the director of Omnilife de Mexico since 1991.\n\nIn 1999 Vergara met film director Alfonso Cuarón while seeking out filmmakers for his corporate movies. Cuarón, however, was more interested in filming \"Y tu mamá también\", and gave Vergara the screenplay. A known lover of films, Vergara read it and right away proposed that they begin production. In the process they established a production company Producciones Anhelo that would go on to co-produce Guillermo del Toro's \"El Espinazo Del Diablo\" (\"The Devil's Backbone\"), along with Pedro Almodóvar's El Deseo and del Toro's Tequila Gang. Anhelo also produced Sebastián Cordero's \"Crónicas\".\n\nIn 2002, \"Variety\" named Vergara one of its Ten Producers to Watch. For the 2004 edition of the Guadalajara Film Festival, Vergara created the JVC Award for Best Director, which was given to Fernando Eimbcke for his feature debut Temporada de patos.\n\nVergara gained ownership of the football team Club Deportivo Guadalajara (popularly known as \"Chivas\") in 2002. Shortly after he took ownership in Mexico, while attending the 2004 U.S. Major League Soccer All-Star Game, he announced intentions to expand Chivas to MLS.\n\nVergara and MLS inaugurated Chivas USA in 2004, and the team played its first official season in 2005 with StubHub Center in the Los Angeles area as its home stadium. Chivas USA was initially successful; in its first five seasons of operation, the team recorded four straight MLS playoff appearances. Both performance and attendance declined sharply after 2009. In August 2012, Vergara and his former wife became sole owners of the club, buying out former partners Antonio and Lorenzo Cué.\n\nOn 20 February 2014, Major League Soccer purchased Chivas USA from Vergara. They announced plans to sell to a buyer dedicated to keeping the club in Los Angeles, as well as a plan to rebrand the club. The team, no longer affiliated with Vergara, has the working name Los Angeles Football Club, and began MLS play in 2018.\n\nVergara has six children: Yelena Vergara Zatarain, Amaury Vergara Zatarian, Kenya Vergara Zatarain, Uma Vergara Lerdo de Tejada, Valentina Vergara and Mariaignacia Vergara.\n\nJorge Vergara divorced Angélica Fuentes Téllez in 21 September 2015.

Kenneth Hopper), a Scots engineer and now a US citizen, has made a lifelong study of different national manufacturing cultures. His studies of the origins of America's factory management culture and its influence on Japanese factory management and elsewhere after World War II have received international recognition. He is the author of numerous academic and professional articles on manufacturing and management.\n\nHe is married to Claire White Hopper, a former bank executive, and lives in Hackettstown, New Jersey. His brother, William Hopper, is an investment banker, based in London. Kenneth Hopper was born Glasgow, Scotland (May 1926).\n\nKenneth Hopper is the son of an eminent Scottish professor of chemistry who had been raised on a small farm in Northern Ireland and educated in a one-room schoolhouse through secondary school. The father's talent, however, earned him a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Science in Dublin. Professor Hopper, being Irish, was not allowed to serve in the Army during World War I, so he found employment as a graduate foreman with British Dyestuffs ( later the Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd.). The nitroglycerine section, where he worked, was known as \"the land of the one-legged stools,\" as plant operators could not be allowed to doze off allowing a vat of new highly explosive liquid to overheat and explode. His father, in addition to his duties at the Royal Technical College, was co-author of a respected text on organic chemistry which is still being used. Professor Hopper also headed the Scottish section for the Society of Chemical Industry. Kenneth recalls many discussions about the chemical industry around the family table, particularly the issues raised about his father's opinion that the Haber labs in Germany were much superior to any British installation. This question of the superior efficacy of various nations' manufactures was thus an early perception of Kenneth Hopper's.\n\nHopper attended \"public\" schools in Glasgow, graduating in 1942. During college, he worked one summer as a \"production chaser\" in the Cathcart Pump works and another in G & J Weir—a young man with a wheelbarrow fetching parts from remote departments, as he describes it. This also gave him the opportunity to visit many areas of the works and observe first-hand the practical problems of major manufacturers. He matriculated at Glasgow University, the premiere British training ground for technology. Upon graduation in 1946, he earned First Class Honours in Mechanical Engineering, Glasgow University.\n\nPending graduation, he had enlisted in the British Army's Signal Corps Officer Training Corps, but when he reported for duty in 1946, he was \"demobbed\" along with other World War II servicemen. However, this brief contact with the world of radio electronics stimulated an interest in that field that flowed naturally into his later studies of the Civil Communications Section seminars. These post-war seminars were designed by the American occupation for Japanese electronics manufacturers, as there was a considerable need to keep the Japanese population informed of America's postwar reconstruction efforts there. Mr Hopper also observed that innovations such as radar, penicillin, and the jet engine came from English inventors, but each of these was turned to another nation, often America, for manufacturing. This was blatantly obvious during the war when fleets of merchant vessels had to be employed to bring parts back to Great Britain that could have been made on the island kingdom, a tragic story of submarine warfare that Hopper heard from P&G's principle fitter. Radar's refinement from a non-directional to a directional scanning device, for instance, came from the Bell Laboratories of Summit, New Jersey, USA. So, Mr. Hopper entered the manufacturing phase of his career with a keen awareness of the need for understanding how industries evolved innovative practices.\n\nMr. Hopper served a graduate apprenticeship at Metropolitan-Vickers from 1946 to 1948, in Manchester, England, then worked for Procter & Gamble (UK) from 1948 to 1957. There he was engineer in charge on the start-up of P&G's Manchester high pressure hydrolysis unit for making soap and on the start-up of P&G's first Standard Tower Unit for making synthetic detergents outside the US.\nMore to the point, as a P&G engineer he was responsible for applying P&G's long-established Just-in-Time Production Control Method. In 1957, as Head of Mechanical Methods and Planning, he led the first introduction of P&G's advanced participative industrial management methods outside the US. On a 1957 visit to the US Hopper met Prof. Peter Drucker, who stimulated his interest in the work of the Civil Communications Section during the American Occupation of Japan.\n\nMr. Hopper expanded on those accomplishments at P&G, and from 1957 to 1962, was a consultant with Associated Industrial Consultants (AIC). He helped Irish manufacturers and the Irish Government reorganise to meet Common Market competition in the early years of the Celtic Miracle.\n• From 1961 to 1962 he represented the Irish Hosiery Manufacturers on the Committee on Industrial Organization (CIO) and was joint author of the CIO 1962 Report on the Irish Hosiery industry.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1963, he was a member of AIC's Division of Industrial and Human Relations, working with manufacturers in the UK. Mr Hopper returned to general consulting with Belgian and French industry in 1964–65. He worked with both the funeral and wine businesses on the continent.\n\nA grant from the Foundation for Management Education allowed Hopper to carry out research on college graduate foremen at the Harvard Business School from 1965 to 1966, some of which was published by the University of Michigan. Entering consulting practice in the US, he provided seminars for Industrial Education International in the US, Canada and the UK and continued publishing articles on the strategy of placing college graduates in strategic manufacturing positions as foremen to get \"on the ground\" experience . This practice was still rare outside of American industry in the Sixties, and with the rise of a certain business school curriculum that promoted financial management over most other skills, it became rarer even in US industry in subsequent decades. His seminal article, \"Can the US Stay Competitive?\" raised his profile among industrialists for a time.\nFrom 1970 onwards. However, illness restricted Mr. Hopper from active consulting but allowed him to pursue research into comparative factory management from his base in New Jersey, and he developed a considerable collection of primary and secondary documents as background for a major publication. This research effort revived the interest of some academic scholars (such as Myron Tribus, emeritus Dean of the Tuck Business School at Dartmouth) in lesser known members of the US Occupation team which sparked the Japanese Miracle after World War II:\n\n• Frank A. Polkinghorn\n• Charles W. Protzman\n• Homer M. Sarasohn\n• Joseph M. Juran and, of course,\n• W. Edwards Deming\n\nIn 1979, with his health much improved, Hopper took his studies to the Japanese, making a five-week tour of Japanese industry, sponsored by Mr. Bunzaemon Inoue, former chairman of the Sumitomo Group. He subsequently publishing several articles about his findings. He continued to publish occasionally while working with his brother, William Hopper, on a major book, \"The Puritan Gift.\" Hopper, Kenneth and William Hopper, The Puritan Gift. NY: I.B. Tauris/Macmillan, 2007. He also developed an interest in American colonial history and lectured on various subjects at Waterloo Village, a restored canal museum (now defunct) in western New Jersey. Kenneth also provided a background seminar on sailing ships for NBC news announcers, John Chancellor and David Brinkley, during the 1975 New York Bi-Centennial Tall Ships festival.\n\nIn 1994, the brothers organised and contributed to a major seminar on the work of MacArthur’s Civil Communications Section at the Japanese Embassy, London, chaired by Lord Howe, former British Foreign Secretary and attended by manufacturing, governmental and financial leaders from the European Union as well as Asian and East European nations.\n\nBook Reviews: Among the many very positive reviews of The Puritan Gift we note that The London Financial Times called the Hoppers' book \"one of the most important business books of the past decade” Stefan Stern, The Financial Times, 22 December 2009 and The Harvard Business Review reviewed it as “This astonishing book about American managerial culture … 'I’ve never read a business book that packed so much information, history, and insight into one compact volume.” Harvard Business Review, January 2010.

Washington was born on his family's Cedar Lawn plantation near Charles Town, Virginia (present-day West Virginia) and was the eldest of 13 children. He practiced law, then served as a second lieutenant in the Virginia Volunteers during the Mexican–American War. During his service in the war, Washington reportedly wore the sword of his great-granduncle George Washington.\n\nFollowing the Mexican–American War, Washington traveled to California in 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush and authored the novel, \"A Tale to be Told Some Fifty Years Hence\". Washington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, where he remained for a few years and fought as a Border Ruffian during the Bleeding Kansas confrontations over slavery along the border between Kansas Territory and Missouri. While under the command of Captain Henry Clay Pate, Washington was present at the June 1856 Free-Stater attack known as Battle of Black Jack, where he sustained minor injuries. Washington died by drowning after falling overboard from a steamboat on the Missouri River in September 1856. His family's descendants claim Washington was murdered by Jayhawkers.\n\nWashington was a great-grandson of Samuel Washington, a great-grandnephew of first President of the United States George Washington, a great-grandson of Robert Rutherford, a United States House Representative from Virginia, and a nephew of Henry Bedinger III, also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nLawrence Berry Washington was born on November 26, 1811, at \"Cedar Lawn\" plantation near Charles Town in Jefferson County, Virginia (present-day West Virginia) and was the eldest son of John Thornton Augustine Washington and his wife Elizabeth Conrad Bedinger Washington.\n\nThrough his father, Washington was a grandson of Thornton Augustine Washington, a great-grandson of Samuel Washington, and a great-grandnephew of first President of the United States George Washington. Through his mother, he was a great-grandson of Robert Rutherford, a United States House Representative from Virginia, and a nephew of Henry Bedinger III, also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives who later served as Chargé d'Affaires and Minister to Denmark for President Franklin Pierce. Washington was raised in a large family at Cedar Lawn, where he had four brothers and eight sisters:\n\nBecause of his large number of siblings, Washington's inheritance from his father in 1841 was not sizable, and he and his brothers pursued a number of business opportunities to build their personal wealth. Washington studied jurisprudence, and was operating a law practice in Charles Town by November 1844. He advertised himself in the \"Spirit of Jefferson\" newspaper as an agent for landowners in the Virginia Military District in Ohio and offered his services for the legal defense and tax payments for those lands. By August 1845, he and his brother Benjamin Franklin Washington were engaged in a real estate venture, selling lots of along the Kanawha River in Mason County.\n\nWashington subsequently served as a second lieutenant in the Virginia Volunteers during the Mexican–American War. At the onset of the war, Washington enrolled in the Jefferson County company (Company K), Second Battalion, of the Virginia Regiment in the United States Army on December 6, 1846. Two and a half weeks later he was selected by a committee of prominent citizens in Charles Town on December 24, 1846, to serve in the company as a second lieutenant.\n\nWashington and his company departed Charles Town on January 4, 1847, and they reached the Brazos River in Texas by March 12. According to the \"Richmond Enquirer\", Washington wore the sword of his great-granduncle George Washington while serving in Mexico. Of the sword carried by Washington, the \"Richmond Enquirer\" stated, \"this precious relic will in itself be potent enough to rally every member of the Virginia regiment to the noblest and most generous deeds.\"\n\nIn July 1847, the \"Charlestown Free Press\" in Charles Town published a letter from Washington in which he praised then General Zachary Taylor as a potential Whig candidate for President. Washington remarked that Taylor was \"a firm and true Whig\" and that when he looked at Taylor, he remarked to himself \"there is the President of the United States that is to be.\"\n\nWhile at Fort Monroe in Hampton, Virginia, after the company's return east, Washington drafted a letter dated May 7, 1848, to United States Secretary of War William L. Marcy offering to raise a company of troops to fight Mexican armed forces in Oregon or elsewhere on the condition that he be granted a captaincy.\n\nFollowing his service in the Mexican–American War, Washington joined the Charles Town Mining Company and traveled to California in 1849 as a Forty-niner in the California Gold Rush with his brother Benjamin Franklin Washington; however, there are no existing records of Washington finding gold during his pursuit. While in California, Washington authored the novel, \"A Tale to be Told Some Fifty Years Hence\", which was published in 1853.\n\nWashington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, where he remained for a few years and fought as a Border Ruffian during the Bleeding Kansas confrontations over slavery along the border between Kansas Territory and Missouri. While in Missouri, Washington wrote poetry and contributed to local newspapers. He returned to Virginia later in the 1850s. While in Virginia, Washington again applied for a military office in March 1855 under an expansion in the Regular Army after Congress added two new regiments to protect the large additional territory obtained from Mexico. By December 1855, Washington was in Kanawha County where he established a joint stock company to promote emigration to Kansas. He returned to Missouri in 1856, where he continued to serve as a Border Ruffian.\n\nWashington served as a Border Ruffian in a company under the command of Captain Henry Clay Pate. On June 2, 1856, Washington and his company were attacked at their encampment near Baldwin City, Kansas by anti-slavery Free-Stater forces under the leadership of abolitionist John Brown. Upon seeing that the Free-Staters' reinforcements were nearby, Captain Pate instructed Washington to send for reinforcements of their own. Washington departed during the early stages of the engagement to send for reinforcements, and sustained slight wounds. Pate surrendered to Brown and his men, and Brown took 25 of the Border Ruffians as prisoners. The attack came to be known as the Battle of Black Jack or the Black Jack Point Affray.\n\nWashington died by drowning after falling overboard from a steamboat on the Missouri River near Rocheport in Boone County, Missouri, on the night of September 21, 1856. Washington family descendants claim that Washington was murdered by Kansas Jayhawkers because of his pro-slavery Southern sympathies and possibly in retaliation for his participation in the Bleeding Kansas conflicts as a Border Ruffian. In remarking of Washington's death, the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" stated that the incident \"gave Kansas the name of 'Bloody'\".\n\nWashington was a lifelong bachelor, and he died without issue. His younger brother, John Thornton Augustine Washington, memorialized Washington by naming his fifth child Lawrence Berry Washington; he was born in San Antonio, Texas, on July 12, 1869.\n\nAccording to a May 1908 article in \"The Scrap Book\" entitled \"If Washington Had Been Crowned\" and later in a February 1951 article in \"Life\" entitled \"If Washington Had Become King: A Carpenter or an Engineer Might Now Rule the U.S.,\" Lawrence Berry Washington would have succeeded his father, John Thornton Augustine Washington, as \"king\" of the United States had his great-granduncle, George Washington, accepted the position of monarch rather than that of president. Throughout the course of 1908 and 1909, the theoretical Washington family royal succession was further publicized in the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\", \"Pittsburgh Daily Post\", \"The Oregon Daily Journal\", and \"The Wichita Daily Eagle\".\n\nFollowing the laws of male preference primogeniture succession recognized by the Kingdom of Great Britain at the time of American independence, Lawrence Berry Washington would have been the lawful heir apparent to his father, who was the eldest son of Thornton Augustine Washington, who in turn was the eldest son of Samuel Washington, George Washington's eldest full brother. A theoretical \"King Lawrence I of the United States\" would have had a reign spanning from his father's death in 1841 until his own death in 1856. Following his death, the American crown would have passed to his next eldest brother, Daniel Bedinger Washington.\n\n"}

Many gases can be put into a liquid state at normal atmospheric pressure by simple cooling; a few, such as carbon dioxide, require pressurization as well. Liquefaction is used for analyzing the fundamental properties of gas molecules (intermolecular forces), for storage of gases, for example: LPG, and in refrigeration and air conditioning. There the gas is liquefied in the \"condenser\", where the heat of vaporization is released, and evaporated in the \"evaporator,\" where the heat of vaporization is absorbed. Ammonia was the first such refrigerant, and is still in widespread use in industrial refrigeration, but it has largely been replaced by compounds derived from petroleum and halogens in residential and commercial applications. \n\nLiquid oxygen is provided to hospitals for conversion to gas for patients with breathing problems, and liquid nitrogen is used in the medical field for cryosurgery, and by inseminators to freeze semen. Liquefied chlorine is transported for eventual solution in water, after which it is used for water purification, sanitation of industrial waste, sewage and swimming pools, bleaching of pulp and textiles and manufacture of carbon tetrachloride, glycol and numerous other organic compounds as well as phosgene gas.\n\nLiquefaction of helium (He) with the precooled Hampson–Linde cycle led to a Nobel Prize for Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1913. At ambient pressure the boiling point of liquefied helium is . Below 2.17 K liquid He becomes a superfluid (Nobel Prize 1978, Pyotr Kapitsa) and shows characteristic properties such as heat conduction through second sound, zero viscosity and the fountain effect among others.\n\nThe liquefaction of gases is a complicated process that uses various compressions and expansions to achieve high pressures and very low temperatures, using, for example, turboexpanders. \n\nThe liquefaction of air is used to obtain nitrogen, oxygen, and argon and other atmospheric noble gases by separating the air components by fractional distillation in a cryogenic air separation unit.\n\nAir is liquefied by the Linde process, in which air is alternately compressed, cooled, and expanded, each expansion results in a considerable reduction in temperature. With the lower temperature the molecules move more slowly and occupy less space, so the air changes phase to become liquid.\n\nAir can also be liquefied by Claude's process in which the gas is allowed to expand isentropically twice in two chambers. While expanding, the gas has to do work as it is led through an expansion turbine. The gas is not yet liquid, since that would destroy the turbine. Commercial air liquefication plants bypass this problem by expanding the air at supercritical pressures. Final liquefaction takes place by isenthalpic expansion in a thermal expansion valve.\n\n"}

The salience of the case comes from the fact that Justice Hardie Boys held the directors of a building company personally liable for damage caused by defective foundations. The case has been described in the Court of Appeal as one that, \"certainly provides some authority for the view that the directors of a building company with actual control of particular building operations owe a duty of care, associated with that control.\"\n\nBetween 1976 and 1977 Douglas Homes Ltd built four flats in a residential subdivision in Waimairi County, Canterbury over the top of an old shingle pit. Before construction, \"the directors had been advised by an engineer on the work necessary for the laying of foundations for two flats. One of the directors did not ensure that the engineer’s advice was adhered to in the construction of the foundations of one flat. The other director specifically took charge of the works on the other, and failed to ensure the engineer’s advice was followed.\"\n\nHardie Boys J reasoned that the directors of Douglas Homes Ltd could be held liable for their negligence as, \"The principle of limited liability protects shareholders and not directors, and a director is as responsible for his own torts as any other servant or agent.\"\n\nHardie Boys J held that in establishing whether a director owed a duty of care the test was to be that established in \"Anns v Merton London Borough Council\" [1978] AC 728 and that a duty of care was founded upon the control a director exercised over the operations of a company.\n\nThe ratio has not yet been overturned and as such remains a precedent for holding directors liable for defects in construction that was under their control. In 2006 in \"Dicks v Hobson Swan Construction Limited (in liquidation),\" Justice Baragwanath applied the ratio of the case to hold a director personally liable for a leaky building constructed by his company. In a 2010 appeal from the Weathertight Homes Tribunal Justice Wylie noted the correct approach to searching for directorial liability lay through the test articulated in \"Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd\";\n"}

{"id": "1817091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1817091", "title": "Petrodollar recycling", "text": "Petrodollar recycling\n\nPetrodollar recycling is the international spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports (\"petrodollars\"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of hundreds of billions of US dollars per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. \n\nThe term petrodollar was coined in the early 1970s during the oil crisis, and the first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).\n\nIn August 2018, Venezuela declared that it would price its oil in Euros, Yuan and other currencies.\n\nEspecially during the years 1974–1981 and 2005–2014, oil exporters amassed large surpluses of \"petrodollars\" from historically expensive oil. (The word has been credited alternately to Egyptian-American economist Ibrahim Oweiss and to former US Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson, both in 1973.) These petrodollar surpluses could be described as net US dollar-equivalents earned from the export of petroleum, in excess of the internal development needs of the exporting nations. The surpluses could not be efficiently invested in their own economies, due to small populations or being at early stages of industrialization; but the surpluses could be usefully invested in other nations, or spent on imports such as consumer products, construction supplies, and military equipment. Alternatively, global economic growth would have suffered if that money was withdrawn from the world economy, while the oil-exporting nations needed to be able to invest profitably to raise their long-term standards of living.\n\nWhile petrodollar recycling reduced the short-term recessionary impact of the 1973 oil crisis, it caused problems especially for oil-importing countries that were paying much higher prices for oil, and incurring long-term debts. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that the foreign debts of 100 oil-importing developing countries increased by 150% between 1973 and 1977, complicated further by a worldwide shift to floating exchange rates. Johan Witteveen, the Managing Director of the IMF, said in 1974: \"The international monetary system is facing its most difficult period since the 1930s.\" The IMF administered a new lending program during 1974–1976 called the Oil Facility. Funded by oil-exporting nations and other lenders, it was available to nations suffering from acute problems with their balance of trade due to the rise in oil prices, notably including Italy and the UK as well as dozens of developing countries.\n\nFrom 1974 through 1981, the total current account surplus for all members of OPEC amounted to US$450 billion, without scaling-up for the subsequent decades of inflation. Ninety percent of this surplus was accumulated by the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf and Libya, with Iran also accumulating significant oil surpluses through 1978 before suffering the hardships of revolution, war and sanctions.\n\nLarge volumes of Arab petrodollars were invested directly in US Treasury securities and in other financial markets of the major industrial economies, often directed discreetly by government entities now known as sovereign wealth funds. Many billions of petrodollars were also invested through the major commercial banks of the US and Europe. In fact, the process contributed to the growth of the Eurodollar market as a less-regulated rival to US monetary markets. As the recessionary condition of the world economy made investment in corporations less attractive, bankers and well-financed governments lent much of the money directly to the governments of developing countries, especially in Latin America such as Brazil and Argentina as well as other major developing nations like Turkey. The 1973 oil crisis had created a vast dollar shortage in these countries; however, they still needed to finance their imports of oil and machinery. In early 1977, when Turkey stopped heating its prime minister's office, opposition leader Suleyman Demirel famously described the shortage as: \"Turkey is in need of 70 cents.\" As political journalist William Greider summarized the situation: \"Banks collected the deposits of revenue-rich OPEC governments and lent the money to developing nations so they could avoid bankruptcy.\" In subsequent decades, many of these developing nations found their accumulated debts to be unpayably large, concluding that it was a form of neocolonialism from which debt relief was the only escape.\n\nIn the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, financial decision-makers were able to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced than they did in the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were much better contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.\n\nThanks to the historic oil price increases of 2003–2008, OPEC revenues approximated an unprecedented US$1 trillion per year in 2008 and 2011–2014. Beyond the OPEC countries, substantial surpluses also accrued to Russia and Norway, and sovereign wealth funds worldwide amassed US$7 trillion by 2014–2015. Some oil exporters were unable to reap the full benefits, as the national economies of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela all suffered from multi-year political obstacles associated with what economists call the \"resource curse\". Most of the other large exporters accumulated enough financial reserves to cushion the shock when oil prices and petrodollar surpluses fell sharply again from an oil supply glut in 2014–2017.\n\nOil-exporting countries have used part of their petrodollar surpluses to fund foreign aid programs, as a prominent example of so-called \"checkbook diplomacy\" or \"petro-Islam\". The Kuwait Fund was an early leader since 1961, and certain Arab nations became some of the largest donors in the years since 1974, including through the IMF and the OPEC Fund for International Development. Oil exporters have also aided poorer nations indirectly through the personal remittances sent home by tens of millions of foreign workers in the Middle East, although their working conditions are generally harsh. Even more controversially, several oil exporters have been major financial supporters of armed groups challenging the governments of other countries.\n\nHigh-priced oil allowed the USSR to support the struggling economies of the Soviet bloc during the 1974–1981 petrodollar surge, and the loss of income during the 1980s oil glut contributed to the bloc's collapse in 1989. During the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, OPEC member Venezuela played a similar role supporting Cuba and other regional allies, before the 2014–2017 oil downturn brought Venezuela to its own economic crisis.\n\nThese images illustrate the diversity of major petrodollar recycling activities, in roughly chronological order:\n"}

This primarily consisted of breaking-up the state-owned railway company Ferrocarriles Argentinos (FA) and allowing the former lines to be operated by private companies instead of the state. This policy was met with widespread criticism and proved catastrophic for the Argentine railways whose service worsened significantly in the years that followed, with entire lines closing and infrastructure deteriorating beyond repair. Privatisation was ultimately reversed in 2015 with the creation of Nuevos Ferrocarriles Argentinos.\n\nSince railway nationalisation in 1948, during the presidency of Juan Perón, the network had been operated by the state-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos (FA) which comprised the six relatively independent divisions, Sarmiento, Mitre, Urquiza, San Martín, Belgrano and Roca.\n\nBy the time that President Carlos Menem's administration took over the Government in 1989 FA had a serious economic deficit, with no investment projected and a high amount of social charges owed to the state. The amount of freight services had considerably decreased between 1970 and 1990, going from 13,500 million of tons to 7,500 millions twenty years after (almost a 55%). The infrastructure and rolling stock were seriously deteriorated, with the exception of central network. Most part of locomotives and coaches had become obsolete therefore the costs of mainteanance had also increased. The aim was to reduce FA's deficit previous to a major restructuring of the company.\n\nWith the railway network's chronic deficit having risen to USD 355 million per year (about USD 1 million per day), the National Congress adopted Law 23,696 (named \"Ley de Reforma del Estado\") that began the privatisation process in 1989.\n\nThe Law allowed president Menem to declare a state of emergency over any state-owned company with the objective to proceed to a privatisation or closure of that company. In November 1989, Menem pronounced his famous threat to any railworkers contemplating strike action: \"Ramal que para, ramal que cierra\" (\"A line that goes on strike is a line that will be shut\").\n\nAlthough FA supported the idea of operating the freight line competing with private companies, the Ministry of Public Works (assisted by the World Bank) excluded FA from the activity, allowing only private concessionaires to operate the lines. In 1990 a program of restructuring was signed by FA, the Ministry and the World Bank. That agreement was the first official document to suggest the possibility to exclude FA from the opearation of public transport.\n\nThe government granted concessions for a term of 30 years, extensible to 10 years else. It was also established that investments made by private operators became property of the state when the contract of concession finished. The concessionaire only kept the rolling stock or other goods acquired during the term of concession.\n\nFor freight transport, the government established zones of interest according to traffic. The first section was Rosario–Bahía Blanca with a traffic estimated in 2,000,000 tones carried by year along its 5,300-km length. The second section was the Urquiza Railway with 1,200,000 ton per year along 2,700-km length. The third section was Mitre Railway with 2,500,000 tons (also considering the possibility of passenger services) in its 4,800-km length. The San Martín Railway was included as the fourth section, with 4,700-km length\n\nMost part of Roca Railway was granted in concession to Ferrosur Roca, property of Loma Negra, the largest cement producer of Argentina. The San Martín was granted to Buenos Aires al Pacífico S.A. while Sarmiento was granted to Ferroexpreso Pampeano (owned by Techint), Urquiza to Ferrocarril Mesopotámico and Mitre to Nuevo Central Argentino.\n\nOnly the Belgrano Railway freight service remained under the control of the state due to lack of interest from private inversors. Nevertheless, the railway would be granted to Belgrano Cargas S.A., a consortium established by railway union \"Unión Ferroviaria\" in 1999. That same year, Brazilian company América Latina Logística (ALL) took over the Urquiza and San Martín lines replacing Ferrocarril Mesopotámico and BAP respectively.\n\nFreight services were granted in concession as follows:\n\nNotes:\n\nIn March 1991 the government separated the urban passenger rail services and metro operating within the city of Buenos Aires from the rest of the rail network, and to this end created the holding company Ferrocarriles Metropolitanos S.A. (FEMESA) whilst the freight concessionaires were expected to make a profit, it was recognized that the operation of these services would require public subsidy. Concessions were granted to the bidder who would require the lowest subsidy. Four companies bid successfully for the seven lines originally operated by the six divisions of Ferrocarriles Argentinos, together with the Subte, as shown below:\n\nNotes:\n\nThe concessions were mainly for 10 years, with an optional 10-year extension, except for the Metro and the Línea Urquiza which were for an initial term of 20 years. As in the case of the freight concessions, the government maintained ownership of the assets, whilst the concessionaires undertook to operate their services as described in their original bid. Maximum fares were set by the government but were subject to automatic increases according to service quality and the prevailing rate of inflation. Financial penalties would be levied if agreed levels of service were not achieved.\n\nIn spite of these companies receiving large government subsidies, the services operated by Metropolitano deteriorated to a point where the concession for the operation of Línea San Martín was revoked in 2004 and concessions for the operation of the other two lines by the company were revoked in 2007. All three lines were subsecquently operated by transitional private consortium UGOFE.\n\nTrenes de Buenos Aires operated the Mitre and Sarmiento lines until concession was revoked after the Once rail disaster on February 22, 2012, at Once Station, Buenos Aires, in which 51 people died and at least 703 people were injured, TBA was placed under federal intervention on February 28; its concessions to operate the Mitre and Sarmiento lines were ultimately revoked on May 24. After the cancellation of the contact, both lines were taken over by transitional consortium Unidad de Gestión Operativa Mitre Sarmiento (UGOMS).\n\nWhen UGOFE and UGOMS were dissolved, Corredores Ferroviarios (a company part of Grupo Roggio, which also owns Metrovías, a company that operates the Buenos Aires Subte and Urquiza line since 1994) and Argentren took over the Mitre / San Martín and Belgrano Sur / Roca lines, respectively. The company operated both lines until the government rescinded the agreement with the company in March 2015.\n\nApart from Corredores Ferroviarios, other private company, Argentren S.A., was granted concession to operate the Roca and Belgrano Sur lines. The contract was also revoked by the government in March 2015.\n\nOn 20 May 1992 the government announced that all inter-city passenger services, other than Buenos Aires to Mar del Plata, would be discontinued on January 1, 1993, unless provincial authorities either agreed to assume responsibility for them or selected a private concessionaire to operate them on their behalf.\n\nProvincial governments that took over the services to avoid closures were: \n\nOn the other hand, \"La Trochita\" was never privatised and closed in 1992 due to the lack of interest of private investors. Nevertheless, the line would be later reopened, being currently operated by Governments of Río Negro and Chubut provinces together.\n\nLong-distance and tourist services granted to private companies are listed below:\n\nNotes:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "974071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=974071", "title": "Ryōichi Sasakawa", "text": "Ryōichi Sasakawa\n\nIn the 1930s, during the Sino-Japanese War, Sasakawa rose to prominence by using wealth gained in rice speculation to build a voluntary flying squad within Japan for the purpose of providing trained pilots in case of a national emergency. He also built an air defense field, donating it to the army. Once Japan began to coordinate its air power in 1941, Sasakawa dissolved his voluntary flying group and gave all of its facilities and aircraft to the nation. In addition, he used the various mining interests that he had accumulated to support the army in a more concrete fashion. Sasaka was more interested in supporting the war effort than making a profit, with one biographer noting that \"his family records show ... that his mining ventures were not as profitable in wartime as they could have been\".\nIn addition, the 1930s saw Sasakawa take the helm of the Kokusui Taishu-to, or Patriotic People's Party (PPP). This small organization was one of the many right-wing groups that sprang up in Japan in the lead-up to World War II. It was in this connection that he first met Yoshio Kodama, who was at that time a member. In 1935, Sasakawa and twelve other leading members of the PPP were arrested and held for three years on suspicion of having ordered the blackmail of several leading companies, such as Takashimaya, the Hankyu Railway, and Tokyo Life Insurance. Though he was eventually acquitted, the jail time and the subsequent appeals process took a total of 6 years, leading up the opening year of World War II. In the end, the prosecution itself revealed that the charges against him had been based more on perception of the PPP as \"dangerous\", than on actual evidence of blackmail.\n\nSasakawa's trials ended in August 1941. In December that year, World War II broke out in the Pacific, and in April 1942, Sasakawa won a seat in the Japanese Diet, taking one of only 85 out of 466 seats that were captured by non-government-backed candidates. The reason that such candidates were so few was that it was wartime, and those in power were doing all they could to control policy while maintaining a mask of parliamentary democracy. Sasakawa joined the Diet nearly a half year after the war began, as a member of the \"opposition\".\n\nIn the Diet, he stood against the government's suppression of the freedom of speech and its pressure for the conformity of all parliamentarians. However, his efforts in this vein were largely unsuccessful, and he spent much of the war outside of the Diet, touring Manchuria and China, visiting prisons around the country, and cheering those on the home front. He advocated war extension. During the war he flew a squadron bomber to Rome and met Mussolini.\n\nAt the end of the war, Sasakawa entered the occupation-run Sugamo prison. While until a short time before his arrest, there was little possibility of his detainment, much less as a Class A war crimes suspect, from October to November, 1945, he launched a campaign of twenty or so speeches in Osaka, decrying victor's justice and demanding to be taken as a prisoner so that he could help defend Japan in the Tokyo war crimes trials. He was \"motivated by a desire to speak out in defense of the emperor and in the interests of Japan at the Tokyo Trials\".\n\nThe US summary for his arrest, dated December 4, 1945 reads as follows:\nWhile in prison, Sasakawa was able to establish connections with many of the men who had led Japan during the war, and who would go on to reassume these roles after their release. He also came into further contact with Yoshio Kodama, though the exact nature of their prison relationship does not seem to have been as positive as it had been when they were both members of the PPP. (In prison, Kodama pursued a policy of collaborating with his captors, naming names and making questionable statements that put other prisoners at a disadvantage. As part of this policy, he asked that his testimony about Sasakawa be kept secret, and it would appear that Sasakawa never found out about it.)\n\nOn December 23, 1948, Hideki Tōjō and six other Class A war criminals were hanged. The next day, all Class A suspects who had not been indicted were released (aside from the seven who were executed, eighteen were given very long or life sentences.) Sasakawa and Kodama were among those who were released. There is much speculation surrounding Sasakawa's release. While some suggest that there was simply not enough evidence to indict him of Class A war crimes, others believe it was due to a lack of resources available to carry out trials of all suspected war criminals. The two men subsequently chose different paths in life, but maintained their friendship until the death of Kodama in 1984.\n\nSasakawa became deeply involved in the post-war reconstruction; though he never again entered politics, he used his considerable influence to bolster business and political parties. The most effective of his post-war activities was the creation of a gambling industry that is still in existence today. Along with his friends Syngman Rhee, the Korean dictator, and Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese nationalist leader, he founded the World Anti-Communist League. Among other coups, the league claims to have played a part in the 1966 overthrow of Indonesia's President Sukarno. Sasakawa stated once: \"I am the world's richest fascist.\"\n\nSasakawa supported Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon in his anti-communist activities.\n\nRyōichi Sasakawa helped form the World Union of Karate-do Organizations in 1970, also serving as its president.\n\nSasakawa died July 18, 1995. He had three sons: Masatada, Takashi and Yohei.\n\nIn 1951 – after extensive bribery of parliamenticians on his behalf – the Japanese Diet passed the Motorboat Racing Law – an invention of Sasakawa's. Under this law, motorboat races are held at 24 locations around the nation for the purpose of both bolstering the local economies and providing the revenue needed to support 1) the reconstruction of Japan's maritime industry, and 2) welfare projects around the country. In later years, international projects were also added. The law established that the distribution of the monies to support projects was to be performed by the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, a body that eventually came to be known as the Nippon Foundation. Sasakawa became the foundation's chairman. Public and governmental focus on the issue drove Sasakawa to take pains to make the system as clear as possible.\n\nKyōtei, a form of boat racing, is one of the sports for which gambling is officially allowed in Japan, established as a means to help with restoring the nation's shipbuilding industry. It was largely responsible for Japan's meteoric rise to become one of the world's maritime leaders by the 1960s. The system is regulated by the department of transport, and many of the foundations Sasakawa later created through grants by The Nippon Foundation were led by previous employees of the department of transport. The system of farming out former government employees to businesses and foundations has long been common, legal practice in Japan, though one that Sasakawa himself viewed with suspicion.\n\nUnder Sasakawa's leadership, The Nippon Foundation made charitable contributions both in Japan and around the world, working with the United Nations on maritime law and with the World Health Organization, donating over $70m to fight leprosy.\n\nThe group also founded or funded a number of other organizations, such as the United States-Japan Foundation; The Sasakawa Peace Foundation; the Sasakawa Africa Association, an expansion of Norman Borlaug's Green Revolution to Africa; and the University of Houston's Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture (SICSA).\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was created by the Saudi Government on 10 April 2000, as part of measures geared towards formalizing the process of economic liberalization. The government body awards investment licensing online and reports to the president of the Supreme Economic Council. SAGIA’s headquarters are located in Riyadh, with three other business centers located in Saudi Arabia: Medina, Dammam and Jeddah. In order to facilitate investment, a larger network of business centers has been announced.\n\nPrior to 2000, Saudi Arabia had failed to attract significant foreign investments in its telecommunications, transportation, and power industries despite being the largest market in the Gulf. Foreign investors were deterred by several factors including incomplete economic data, restrictive visa policies for workers, and an extremely conservative cultural environment.\n\nSince 2016, the SAGIA holds a central position in the deployment of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.\n\nIntending to liberalize the nation's trade and investment programs, diversify the economy, and join the World Trade Organization, the Saudi Arabian Council of Ministers initiated the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) in April 2000. Under the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 2 dated April 9, 2000, the Authority was created as a vehicle for investment in Saudi Arabia, with the purpose of sustaining economic growth and addressing investment affairs nationwide, including foreign investment.\n\nThe objective of SAGIA’s “10 x 10” program, which ran from 2005 to 2010, was to place Saudi Arabia among the world’s top ten competitive investment destinations by 2010. SAGIA created the National Competitiveness Center (NCC) to compare the performance of Saudi Arabia’s investment opportunities to more than 300 indicators of global competitiveness, assessed in such publications as the World Bank’s \"Doing Business\" report, the World Economic Forum’s \"Global Competitiveness Report\", and the IMD’s \"World Competitiveness Yearbook\". According to the World Bank \"Doing Business\" report, Saudi Arabia rose from number 67 in 2005 to number 16 in 2009.\n\nLaunched in 2006, the Economic Cities program was designed to drive toward greater competitiveness, job creation, and economic diversification.\n\nIn developing economic cities, over a thousand of the world’s free zones were surveyed. The sixty deemed most successful were studied to determine key success factors. The objectives of the Economic Cities were to promote regional development, achieve economic diversification, create jobs, and enhance competitiveness in Saudi Arabia. Four new cities were identified and thus developed: King Abdullah Economic City, Jazan Economic City, Prince Abdulaziz Bin Mousaed Economic City, and the Knowledge Economic City, Medina.\n\nIn October 2011, Pfizer signed an agreement with SAGIA to set up its first manufacturing plant in King Abdullah Economic City. In June 2016, SAGIA gave Pfizer 100% foreign ownership of its legal entity in Saudi Arabia. In August 2017, SAGIA announced allowing 100 percent foreign ownership in the engineering business, after consultations.\n\nThe SAGIA is responsible for three main functions: making improvements to increase the Kingdom's competitiveness as an investment destination; building upon the quality of service and value proposition offered to investors; and offering new investment opportunities to attract businesses and investors alike, to help advance Saudi Arabia's economic diversification agenda. Since its creation in 2000, SAGIA also addresses internal obstacles such as women's rights in the workplace to tackle issues related to the investment climate.\n\nSAGIA acts as provider of all investment-related services in the Kingdom: Advisory services, business match-making, liaison and coordination across government departments, instant online licenses. In 2009 the Kingdom was listed as 8th largest in the worldwide ranking of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) recipients.\n\nThe SAGIA organizes the Global Competitiveness Forum is an annual program of activities held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Authority’s board of directors comprises 14 directors from the Saudi private and public sectors. Prince Saud Bin Khalid Al-Faisal has been deputy governor of SAGIA since December 2010. Governors of SAGIA served four-year terms, as follows:\n\n\n"}

As of 2013 he was considered to be one of Indonesia's wealthiest individuals with a net worth of US$ 2.3 billion. After starting as a supplier of equipment and materials for the state-owned oil firm Pertamina, Tanoto moved into the forest industry in 1973. Tanoto's business interests are represented by the Royal Golden Eagle (RGE) group of companies (previously known as Raja Garuda Mas).\n\nBorn in Medan, North Sumatra province, on Christmas Day 1949, Tanoto is the oldest of seven boys. His father was an immigrant from Putian city in China's Fujian province. In 1966, Tanoto's education was abruptly interrupted after Chinese schools were shut down by then-President Suharto's new regime. He was prohibited from attending national schools due to his parents' Chinese citizenship.\n\nWhen his father suffered a stroke, Tanoto was left to run the family business. He gradually moved beyond basic trading to winning contracts in building gas pipelines for multinationals. During the 1972 oil crisis that increased prices dramatically, Tanoto took advantage of clients rapidly expanding their operations. With this injection of capital, Tanoto turned his attention to another business in 1973, noticing that Indonesia exported raw logs for conversion into plywood in countries like Japan or Taiwan, before importing the finished plywood back to Indonesia at great cost.\n\nTanoto recognized an opportunity to develop his own plywood mill in Indonesia. However, he required a permit to do so. Under the Suharto regime, permits were sought from politicians who often served as army generals. Tanoto was forced to work with a general who gave his blessing and was quickly convinced of the mill's potential after seeing the completed factory, with Tanoto citing the potential value-add to Indonesia's economy and the creation of new jobs. The plant began operations in 1975 after being inaugurated by Suharto. Slowly, from the plywood business, his company branched out into palm oil as well as pulp and paper.\n\nTanoto is a self-educated entrepreneur but regretted his interrupted education. He learned English word-for-word using a Chinese-English dictionary and finally attended business school in Jakarta in the mid-1970s. He also undertook further studies at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France.\n\nIn 1997, Tanoto elected to settle in Singapore with his family, establishing his company's headquarters there.\n\nThree of his children are active within RGE and its businesses. His son, Anderson, is an RGE director. His eldest daughter Imelda is a member of the RGE executive committee while his younger daughter Belinda dedicates most of her time to the family's philanthropic arm, Tanoto Foundation. All four of Tanoto's children are also trustee members at Tanoto Foundation.\n\nTanoto's business interests are represented by the Royal Golden Eagle (RGE), a global resource-based group of companies with manufacturing operations in Indonesia, China, Brazil, Canada and Europe, and sales offices worldwide. Since Sukanto Tanoto started his entrepreneurial journey in 1967, the business has grown considerably, with a workforce of over 60,000 people and its assets exceeding US$18 billion. The business has five key operational areas: pulp and paper (Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings or APRIL, Asia Symbol), agro-industry (Asian Agri), specialty cellulose (Bracell Limited) and viscose fibre (Sateri) and energy resources development (Pacific Oil & Gas). APRIL has been involved in conservation controversies related to the use of native Sumatran growth forests, which led to the company withdrawing from the Forest Stewardship Council in April 2010. In September 2011, Fuji Xerox ceased selling paper manufactured by APRIL. The company has denied the claims, stating it has a commitment to implement practices that mitigate climate change and promote sustainability. Furthermore, in June 2015, APRIL pledged to eliminate deforestation from its entire supply chain. The announcement was well received by both Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nIn early 2016, Tanoto announced an update of the RGE groupwide business principles - to do what is good for community, country, climate and company. In 2017, marking his 50th year as an entrepreneur, Sukanto Tanoto introduced 'Customer' as the fifth C.\n\nTanoto and his wife, Tinah Bingei Tanoto, began their philanthropic work in 1981 in Indonesia with the opening of a kindergarten in Besitang. They formally established the Tanoto Foundation in 2001. Its numerous educational initiatives have included the funding of teacher training and the provision of over 700 scholarships a year. The Foundation also delivers basic amenities such as clean water and sanitation, as well as healthcare. Through the provision of access to productive assets, startup capital, technical skills and links to markets, it helps to empower families and deliver sustainable livelihood.\n\nTanoto recognized the importance of establishing strong corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs in the Riau province. Through Riau Andalan Pulp & Paper (RAPP), Tanoto built schools and established farming systems that teach villagers an alternative cultivation to slash-and-burn techniques, as well making regular sustainability reports to NGOs, such as the World Wildlife Fund after the organization expressed concerns over the conservation of forests in Riau.\n\nThe reach of Tanoto Foundation's activities now extends to China, Hong Kong and Singapore and the US. It has provided more than 20,000 scholarships, built several schools and educational facilities that produced 27,000 graduates, developed 60,000 hectares of community livelihood plantations and created more than 1,800 jobs in local communities through Small-and-Medium-size Enterprise (SME) programs.\n\nSukanto Tanoto also awards professorship awards. In 2007, the award valued at US$130,000 was granted to two Indonesian academic scientists for their efforts to enable socially-responsible technological research programs. He also funds a support professorship in metabolism and endocrinology at the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore and is a regular donor to Carnegie Mellon, where his contributions fund the \"Tanoto Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering\" position. Three other professorship awards in the area of oncology, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases were also awarded in year 2016, 2013, 2014 respectively. The Foundation has also supported disaster relief efforts across Asia.\n\nTanoto donated the building of the INSEAD library in Singapore in 2005, which was renamed \"Tanoto Library\" in 2005. He was the first donor to the construction of the Beijing National Stadium in 2006. He also donated to the building of the Beijing National Aquatics Center.\n\nTanoto Foundation and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania launched the Tanoto Initiative in July 2013. It is a multi-component program to promote studies and research on ASEAS, with a focus on Indonesia. The Wharton faculty works closely with selected Indonesian universities to offer research grants, academic courses, exchange programs and scholarships aimed at deepening thought leadership and business education in the ASEAN region.\n\nTanoto donated 30 million yuan for the construction of a public library in Rizhao, Shandong, China in 2010. He later donated 200,000 children's books to a public library in June 2016.\n\nIn Dec 2015, Tanoto launched the Tanoto Forestry Information Center at the Bogor Agricultural University. The Center supports the development of forestry science in Indonesia.\n\nIn Feb 2016, it was announced Tanoto Foundation would collaborate with the United Nations Development Programme to support work with the Riau provincial governments in implementing sustainable development goals at provincial and district levels.\n\nIn March 2016, Tanoto Foundation donated 100 million yuan to fund and develop training programs under the One Belt, One Road framework for 10 years. The training program involved collaborations with Tsinghua University, Fudan University and Huaqiao University.\n\nIn September 2017, Tanoto Foundation renewed its donation to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)'s Tanoto Centre for Asian Family Business and Entrepreneurship Studies.\n\n\n"}

He was popularly known as CK Tang. Tang has been credited for leading the way for the retail market in Singapore and establishing Orchard Road as a premier retail district in Singapore.\n\nA Teochew, Tang was born at the turn of the 20th century in Shantou, China to a Presbyterian pastor. He emigrated to the British colony of Singapore in 1923.\n\nIn Singapore, Tang began as a door-to-door salesman peddling hand-made Swatow lace, embroidery and linen products. With a hired rickshaw, Tang carried his goods in a pair of tin trunks which remained in his possession as a reminder of his humble beginnings. Tang later became known as the \"Tin Trunk Man\" and the \"Curio King\" for his rags to riches legacy.\n\nIn 1932, Tang was able to embark on a larger venture, having accumulated sufficient funds through hard work. He established a department store in 1932 with an initial capital of S$3,000. Tang set up his first shop on the first floor of a building on River Valley Road, selling craft products from China.\n\nSubsequently in 1940, Tang financed the construction of a new building at the corner of Jalan Mohamed Sultan and River Valley Road to house a new department store. He called the new edifice \"Gainurn Building\", a variation of his father's name Tang Gan Urn. The department store sold a vast array of merchandise. By the 1950s, CK Tang had opened several more branches.\n\nIn 1958, Tang bought a 1,351-square metre piece of land at the corner of Orchard Road and Scotts Road at a cost of S$10,000 to further his vision of expanding his business. Although the site faced the Tai San Ting Cemetery, he felt that it had commercial value as many British housewives in the Tanglin area could stop by on their way to the city. The decision was made against the advice of fellow businessmen who thought Orchard Road was unfashionable then. Years later, when the Singapore Government designated and developed Orchard Road as a prime shopping and tourist district, the price of land soared from S$3 per m² to S$6,000 per m².\n\nWith the acquired land plot, Tang constructed the landmark C.K. Tang Department Store (now rebranded as Tangs) at 310 Orchard Road at a cost of S$50,000. The building's green-tiled roof and facade was modelled after the Imperial Palace of the Forbidden City in Beijing. In 1960, Tang voluntarily closed the store due to problems with the trade unions, but Tangs was re-opened the following year. In 1975, Tang's company was publicly listed. \nIn the late 1970s, Tang expanded his business again when he decided to develop the neighbouring property lots which he had bought years before. In 1982, the building on Orchard Road was demolished to make way for the new Tang complex, comprising the 33-storey deluxe Dynasty Hotel (now the Singapore Marriott Hotel) and the Tangs shopping complex (now Tang Plaza). The shopping complex consists of five floors of retail space covering more than 15,000 m², marketed under the slogan \"All The Best Under One Roof\".\n\nIn 1991, Tangs opened its first overseas branch in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Tang also collaborated with Malaysia's Mayang Sari Bhd to develop real estate, hotels and commercial properties in Kuala Lumpur. He also assisted the Dairy Farm International Holdings in its retail business in Malaysia.\n\nUntil 1996, Tangs was the only major shopping centre in Singapore to not operate on Sundays, in deference to Tang's Christian faith. Tang instituted the policy so that his family and Christian staff could attend church on Sundays. As a staunch Christian, Tang spoke of honesty and hard work as his guiding principles.\n\nTang's distinctive management philosophy was the focus on people, both customers and staff. Emphasis was given to quality of the staff, reasonable pricing and warm service. Tang believed in investing in his staff, as his frontline staff would be the ones who would be in direct contact with the customers and he believed that the image of the store depended on them. As a result, Tang reserved a substantial annual budget for staff training, which included tailored programs for sales staff, supervisors and management. Supervisors and managers were expected to undergo a minimum 100 hours of training. Tang also made an effort to get in touch with his staff at all levels, in order understand his customers' expectations on product and service quality. Despite the company's poor financial results in certain years, Tangs retained its reputation for good service and reliability.\n\nTang retired in 1987, handing the reins of corporate leadership to the second of his three sons, Tang Wee Sung. Tang retained the post of company president and was rarely out of touch with company business, personally checking the company's accounts and meeting suppliers.\n\nBesides CK Tang, Tang Choon Keng was also known as Tang Un Tien. \n\nIn 1960, Tang was kidnapped by four armed thugs, but was freed unharmed within 84 hours after the family reportedly paid S$150,000 in ransom.\n\nTang's first wife died in 1980; he subsequently remarried. Tang had eight children. On 3 September 2000, Tang died peacefully at home with his family around him at 98 years old.\n\nTang died on 3 September 2000 in Singapore.\n\n\n"}

The station's broadcast license is held by\nCiticasters Licenses, Inc., a subsidiary of iHeartMedia, Inc.. The station airs a radio format that mixes syndicated talk shows, sports and paid brokered programming. WHNZ is one of the eight stations in the Tampa Bay radio market owned by iHeartMedia.\n\nThe station's studios are located on West Gandy Boulevard in South Tampa. The transmitter site is off Memorial Highway in Town 'n' Country, Florida, co-located with sister station 970 AM WFLA. By day, WHNZ broadcasts at 25,000 watts. But at night, to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 1250, WHNZ reduces power to 5,900 watts. The station uses a directional antenna at all times.\n\nWeekday mornings begin with \"This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal\". In afternoon drive time, WHNZ carries the \"Todd Schnitt Show.\" Schnitt for many years was a host on co-owned 970 WFLA in Tampa. His syndicated show airs in Tampa Bay on WHNZ live at 3pm and it is replayed on WFLA at 6pm. At night, WHNZ carries Fox Sports Radio. Brokered programs on money, business and health are heard in middays, evenings and weekends. CBS Radio News begins most daytime hours.\n\nWHNZ is the successor of two radio stations, co-owned WDAE, one of Florida's oldest radio stations, going on the air May 15, 1922 and spending most of its history at AM 1250. And it also has history on AM 570 in Pinellas Park, which was WHNZ's original dial position and carried some of the same business and financial shows that are heard on today's WHNZ.\n\nOn October 24, 1991, what was then WPLP was bought by Paxson Communications, the company founded by multi-millionaire Bud Paxson after he had sold the Home Shopping Network. Unlike today's WHNZ, Paxson put a full-time business and financial station on AM 570, changing the call sign to WHNZ. Those call letters refer to \"Wins Radio,\" meaning that it will help you win in the business world. In 1998, Clear Channel Stations, the previous name of iHeartMedia, bought AM 570. It also bought AM 620 from Cox Communications, after Cox had moved what was WSUN and its Adult Standards format to co-owned AM 910 in nearby Plant City, Florida, in anticipation of a sale. Once Clear Channel owned all three frequencies, 570, 620 and 1250, it was able to execute a three-way frequency swap.\n\nOn New Year's Day, 2000, WDAE's sports format and call sign moved to AM 620. WHNZ's business format and call sign moved to AM 1250. And Clear Channel put a news/talk format on AM 570, giving it the call sign WTBN, which stood for Tampa Bay News. The following year, Salem Communications took over AM 570, installing a Christian radio format, heard currently on WTBN.\n\nWHNZ was the flagship station of the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team from 2005 to 2008, now heard on WDAE. , WHNZ airs select sporting events moved from WDAE or WFLA due to schedule conflicts. Beginning on May 19th, 2018, WHNZ will be the radio home of the Tampa Bay Rowdies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43933588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43933588", "title": "Walter O'Brien", "text": "Walter O'Brien\n\nWalter O'Brien (born 24 February 1975) is an Irish businessman and information technologist. He was also the executive producer and loose inspiration of the television series \"Scorpion\". He is known for various self-reported claims including a childhood IQ of 197 which have been scrutinized.\n\nWalter O'Brien was born to Maurice and Anne O'Brien in 1975 in Clonroche, County Wexford, Ireland. The second of five children, he grew up on a farm. He attended St. Patrick's National School in Clonroche until his family moved to Rosshaven, when he was 13 years old. There he attended St. Mary's Christian Brothers School, Enniscorthy.\n\nO'Brien has stated he scored a 197 on an IQ test administered by one of his teachers in primary school but did not keep the paperwork.\n\nTechdirt and \"The Irish Times\" said that O'Brien's 197 IQ score from childhood does not mean his intelligence exceeds that of other adults because scoring is scaled based on age. Mike Masnick noted that of all the \"top IQ\" lists available online, each one is different and none contains O'Brien's name. Susan Karlin questioned why, since O'Brien uses his childhood IQ score as part of his self-marketing, he did not retake the test through Mensa so that it could be confirmed.\n\nAfter completing his Leaving Certificate at St Kieran's College in Kilkenny, O'Brien attended the University of Sussex where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science and artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to the \"New Ross Standard\", a local paper in O'Brien's home county, his interest in computers began when his primary school started offering a computer course. O'Brien's father gave him livestock as payment for doing chores on the farm, which he sold in order to purchase an Amstrad personal computer at age nine, around 1984.\n\nOther sources indicate that his interest began when he was 12, when parents bought him a computer.\n\nO'Brien has stated that when he was thirteen years old (), he hacked into NASA under the pseudonym \"Scorpion\". \"The Irish Daily Mail\" reported that the incident was unconfirmed.\n\nIn an interview with \"Silicon Republic\", an Irish technology news website, O'Brien claimed that the NSA, through Interpol, appeared at his home following the hack. He told the agents he would help show them vulnerabilities in their network in exchange for not getting into trouble. According to O'Brien, he had an extradition document ready in his backpack, but he could not provide more details on the deal that was made due to non-disclosure agreements.\n\nFrench tabloid \"Telestar\" reported that there is no record of the alleged NASA hack. \"Techdirt\" pointed out that the United States Department of Homeland Security -- which CBS showed surrounding O'Brien's family's home in the television show -- did not exist at the time of the alleged hack.\n\nO'Brien was a member of the Irish team that participated in the 1993 International Olympiad in Informatics computer coding competition. The university from which he graduated shows his team finished the 1993 Olympiad in 90th place out of 250.\n\nO'Brien allegedly founded Scorpion Computer Services at age 13 in 1988. \"The Irish Times\" reported he brought the business with him in the late 1990s, after graduating from college and moving to the United States. The \"New Ross Standard\" wrote that Scorpion Computer Services started as an IT tutoring service that expanded into security and risk management, and \"The Irish Times\" also described Scorpion Computer Services as an artificial-intelligence company. In 2014, O'Brien described his company as a think tank for \"high IQ individuals\". In 2018, Jane's reported that the U.S. Army was using Scorpion's artificial intelligence tool, ScenGen, on its unmanned aerial systems.\n\nO'Brien is Chief Scientist at Langford & Carmichael, a veteran-run business consultancy. O'Brien created ConciergeUp.com, a service of Scorpion Computer Services marketed as a think tank of geniuses that execute \"funded wishes\".\n\nA month after the bombing at the 2013 Boston Marathon, Fox 11 LA-KTTV (Los Angeles) reported that O'Brien's company, Scorpion Computer Services, Inc., developed video-analysis software similar to that used by the FBI to catch the bombers. \"Techdirt\" said that this was one of many \"bogus\" claims about O'Brien by CBS.\nAsher Langton, a security intelligence engineer, said O'Brien offered conflicting narratives of his contributions to catching the bombers and that the use of facial recognition software in the manner reported was implausible. O'Brien said he was bound by non-disclosure agreements.\n\nAccording to O'Brien, in an effort to promote his company Scorpion Computer Services, Inc. and its service Concierge Up, he came up with the idea to create a television show. O'Brien contacted Scooter Braun who shopped the idea to CBS. In September 2014, CBS premiered the first season of the drama series, \"Scorpion\", based on O'Brien's alleged life experiences. He serves as an executive producer for the series, and regularly contributes to story development. For his part in story development O'Brien consults with series writers on technical aspects of the plot, including how he would solve problems presented in the show's scripts. The technical aspects of the plot, however, were a reason for the National Science Teachers Association to advise teachers to use the show as an example of incorrect or exaggerated science in 2015. O'Brien also consults with Elyes Gabel, the actor who plays the fictional Walter O'Brien. In an interview with CBS News to promote the second season, Gabel said about O'Brien that \"he's out saving the world or talking to, you know, princes of Liechtenstein. So every now and again, I get the chance to talk to him and he'll call me up. And sometimes we talk about the show. Sometimes we talk about characters.\"\n\nThe first season attracted more than 26 million viewers. CBS ordered a full season of \"Scorpion\" in October 2014 and renewed it for a second season in 2015. The show was renewed again for a third season in 2016, with a fourth seasoned confirmed for 2017. In March 2017, CBS renewed Scorpion for season 4. The first episode of this new season premiered on September 25, 2017. The show was cancelled after four seasons in May 2018.\n\nIn 2014, CNET, Techdirt, and \"Fast Company\" evaluated CBS' claims about O'Brien's accomplishments, widely reported in the media, following questions to \"Fast Company\". \"The Irish Times\" said that \"it is impossible to substantiate some claims.\" In a follow-up interview with Susan Karlin of \"Fast Company magazine\", O'Brien answered some of Karlin's questions but said that he was bound by non-disclosure agreements.\n\nKarlin wrote that some community edited business directories showed O'Brien's company was much smaller than the 2,600 employees and $1.3 billion in revenues stated in Karlin's original article. For example, in 2014 an anonymous editor on Credibility.com recorded Scorpion Computer Services as having 1 employee with annual revenue of $66,000. Karlin points out that community edited business directories data may be unreliable, and O'Brien stated that most of the company consists of independent contractors who work remotely.\n\nIn a News.com.au interview of Elyes Gabel, the actor who plays the fictional O'Brien in the TV show, the reporter Andrew Fenton says: \"But even Elyes Gabel, who plays O'Brien in the show, admits he has some concerns over the veracity of the story. He says that to find the character he had to push those doubts to one side and just accept O'Brien's story as gospel.\" \"That meant everything that he was saying I believe rather than kind of questioning,\" he says. \"That becomes a very dangerous, treacherous area if you don't really fully commit or believe in what somebody is saying. So once I got rid of that, the balance became: 'How do I make this guy? How do I create vulnerability in a character?\"\n\nFenton goes on to say:\n\nO'Brien has lived in Los Angeles, California since 2001 when he was issued an E11 visa to immigrate to the United States. This type of visa is set aside for people with \"extraordinary abilities\" and/or who can be considered a national asset.\n\nIn 2015, \"Kilkenny People\" reported that O'Brien received a mayoral certificate from the mayor of Kilkenny for his contribution and dedication to the Irish community in Los Angeles. O'Brien helped fund the start-up cost of Kilkenny Taxi Watch which \"Kilkenny People\" reported as having prevented 45 suicides through July 2015. By April 2016, Taxi Watch stated on their Facebook page that the number of lives saved had reached 100.\n\nO'Brien has spoken at numerous events, including delivering the keynote at the MENSA 2016 annual gathering event in San Diego, and the Houston Innovation Conference and Showcase.\n\nIn 2017, O'Brien was honored with Humanitarian Lifetime Achievement award.\n\n"}
