Their plans were first drawn in 1963 by the Rockefeller family's architect, Wallace Harrison, of the architectural firm Harrison and Abramovitz. Their letters correspond to their height. 1251 Avenue of the Americas is the \"X\" Building as it is the tallest at 750 ft (229 m) and 54 stories, and was the first completed, in 1971. The \"Y\" is 1221 Avenue of the Americas, which was the second tower completed (1973) and is the second in height (674 ft and 51 stories). The \"Z\" Building, the shortest and the youngest, is 1211 Avenue of the Americas with 45 stories (592 ft). \n\nThe building is the former headquarters of McGraw-Hill Financial, from which it derived its former name. Other tenants include Sirius XM Satellite Radio, whose headquarters and broadcast facility are in the building.\n\nThe sunken courtyard of this building contains a large metal triangle designed by Athelstan Spilhaus and fabricated by Tyler Elevator Products, arranged so the Sun aligns with its sides at solstices and equinoxes. When built, the southwestern corner held a display of scale models of planets in the Solar System. A mosaic map of the Earth survives in the northwestern corner.\n\nAfter entering an express elevator at approximately 11:00 p.m. (EDT) Friday on October 15, 1999, Nicholas White, an employee of the building, who was going down to take a cigarette break, became trapped after a brief power dip caused the elevator to stop between the 13th and 14th floors. Though he signaled an alarm and there was surveillance video inside the elevator cab, White was not rescued until approximately 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, October 17, nearly 41 hours later, after security guards spotted him in the surveillance cameras.\n\nThe buildings are featured in the opening credits of \"Saturday Night Live\", seen from below looking up in the street from a car.

According to Cowan their lifestyles were a great help in their subsequent careers: \"We each had to have a car. We were able to drive in fields, off road, and of course through all the twisty roads around here where there was practically no traffic in those days. That definitely refined our driving skills. We had advantages that other drivers didn't.\"\n\nBoth men were active in the Berwick and District Motor Club during the 1950s, but while Clark gravitated to open-wheeled racing, Cowan ventured off-road, and took part in the 1960 RAC Rally, eventually finishing 43rd of over 200 starters in a Sunbeam Rapier. Impressed by his success, his father bought him a newer, more powerful Rapier as a replacement, and behind the wheel of his new vehicle, he won the 1962 Scottish Rally, an achievement he later declared to be his \"Most Important Moment\". He returned the following year to successfully defend his title, and as a result the Rootes Group invited him to become their 'works' driver.\n\nOnce established as a professional driver, Cowan had many notable successes with both Rootes and subsequently Mitsubishi, for whom he signed in 1972. Aside from his two Scottish Rally titles, he won the first two London-Sydney Marathons in 1968 and 1977, five consecutive Southern Cross Rallies (1972–76), the 1977 Rallye Bandama Côte d'Ivoire, and the world's longest rally, the 20,000-mile South American Marathon in 1978. He was also competitive in the Safari Rally where he recorded a top four finish four times in five years, and latterly the Paris-Dakar Rally where his best result was second overall in 1985. He retired as a driver in 1990.\n\nFor his achievements in 1977, he was awarded the British Guild of Motoring Writers' \"Driver of the Year\" Award, the \"Jim Clark Memorial Trophy\" for \"outstanding achievement by a Scottish driver\", and the British Racing Drivers' Club's \"John Cobb Trophy\" for a British driver of outstanding success.\n\nIn 1983, Mitsubishi Motors asked him to establish a European base for their motorsport activities, and so he founded Andrew Cowan Motorsports (ACMS). Based in Rugby, Warwickshire, it would evolve into Mitsubishi Ralliart Europe, and his cars took Tommi Makinen to four consecutive WRC Drivers' titles (1996 to 1999), as well as winning Mitsubishi their only manufacturers' crown in 1998.\n\nIn 2003, Mitsubishi Motors officially took over the business and renamed it Mitsubishi Motorsport, although Cowan remained as \"Sporting Advisor\" for the next two years until his retirement aged 69.\n\nIn September 2008, Cowan took part in the \"Colin McRae Forest Stages Rally\", a round of the Scottish Rally Championship. He was one of a number of former rally drivers to take part in the event in memory of McRae, who died in 2007.\n\n"}

It is located on a point on the northern bank of the Brisbane River. The triangular shaped area is bounded by the Brisbane River to the east, south and west. The point, known at its tip as Gardens Point, slopes upward to the north-west where the city is bounded by parkland and the inner city suburb of Spring Hill to the north. The CBD is bounded to the north-east by the suburb of Fortitude Valley. To the west the CBD is bounded by Petrie Terrace, which in 2010 was reinstated as a suburb (after being made a locality of Brisbane City in the 1970s).\n\nThe Brisbane central business district is an area of densely concentrated skyscrapers and other buildings, interspersed by several parks such as Roma Street Parklands, City Botanic Gardens and Wickham Park. It occupies an area of 1.367 km². The City is laid out according to a grid pattern surveyed during the city's early colonial days, a feature typical of most Australian street patterns. As a general rule, the streets aligned northwest-south east are named after male members of the House of Hanover, while the northeast-south west aligned streets are named after female members. Queen Street was the central roadway, that was turned into a pedestrian mall. It forms the pivotal axis for the grid of roads within the district.\n\nThe Brisbane central business district was built on a spur of the Taylor Range with the highest spot in the suburb being Wickham Terrace. North Quay is an area in the CBD that was a landing point during the first European exploration of the Brisbane River.\n\nPetrie Bight is a reach of the Brisbane River (), which gives its name to the small pocket of land centred on the area under the Story Bridge's northern point, around the Brisbane River to Admiralty Towers II. The location was originally known as Petrie Gardens and was an early settlement farm, one of two that provided food for the colony. The site was named after Andrew Petrie and has been the base for water police and in earlier times wharves. The location of Customs House and the preference for wharves was due to site being directly downstream from the central business district.\n\nThe Brisbane City Library opened in 1965, moving into Brisbane Square in 2006.\n\nUp until 1964, a Brisbane City Council regulation limited building heights to . Some of the first skyscrapers built in the CBD include the SGIO building (now Suncorp Plaza) in 1970 and AMP Place in 1977.\n\nIn the last few decades the number of apartment buildings that have been constructed has increased substantially.\nBrisbane is home to several of Australia's tallest buildings. Brisbane's tallest buildings are Skytower at 270 metres, One William Street at 260 metres, Soleil at 243 metres, Aurora Tower at 207 metres, Riparian Plaza at 200 metres, One One One Eagle Street at 195 metres, and Infinity at 249 metres, which was completed in 2014.\n\nThe Brisbane CBD is one of the major business hubs in Australia. The City contains many tall office buildings occupied by organisations, businesses and all three levels of government that have emerged into a number of precincts. The areas around the Queen Street Mall and Adelaide Street is primarily a retail precinct. A legal precinct exists around the various court buildings located around the intersections of George Street and Adelaide and Ann Streets.\n\nThe government precinct is an area centred on the Executive Building that includes many Queensland Government offices. 111 George Street, Mineral House, and Education House are also located here.\n\nThe Brisbane CBD has only one third the number of premium hotel rooms that either Sydney or Melbourne's central business districts have.\n\nThe city is serviced by a number of schools in the surrounding suburbs including the Petrie Terrace State School in Paddington and The Albert Park Flexi School in Petrie Terrace.\n\nLike most other Australian capital cities, Brisbane has experienced dramatic rises in rental prices for residential and office space before the global financial crisis. At the beginning of 2008, the Brisbane central business district contained 1.7 million square metres of office space.\nHigh demand in the office market had pushed vacancy rates in the Brisbane CBD to 0.7% by January 2008, the lowest in Australia. Premium grade office space was even less vacant with an occupancy rate of 99.9%. By the end of 2009 the situation had reversed. In mid 2013 the market for office space had declined to its worst position in two decades with a vacancy rate of just under 13%.\n\nIn the CBD there many attractions; Queensland's Parliament House, the Queensland University of Technology Gardens Point Campus and the Brisbane City Hall. The Queens Gardens, Post Office Square, King George Square and the City Botanic Gardens are open public spaces located here.\n\nThe Brisbane City Council operates a public library in Brisbane Square at 266 George Street.\n\nBrisbane has many heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nIn the 2016 Census, there were 9,460 people in Brisbane City. 32.2% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were China 8.9%, South Korea 8.3%, England 3.7%, Taiwan 3.2% and Brazil 2.8%. 43.7% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 12.3%, Korean 7.7%, Cantonese 3.6%, Spanish 2.9% and Portuguese 2.7%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 43.0% and Catholic 16.8%.\n\nBy road, four road bridges connect the CBD with the southern bank of the Brisbane River: the Captain Cook Bridge, the Victoria Bridge, the William Jolly Bridge and the Go Between Bridge. The Story Bridge connects Fortitude Valley with Kangaroo Point and provides access to the city from the southern bank. The Captain Cook Bridge connects the Pacific Motorway, south of the river, with the Riverside Expressway which runs along the south western edge of the city. Heading under and bypassing the CBD is the Clem Jones Tunnel.\n\nBy bicycle and foot, the Goodwill Bridge allows cross river access to South Bank. The Kurilpa Bridge allows cross river accrss from North Quay to South Brisbane. Cyclists and pedestrians may also cross while using the Victoria, William Jolly, Go Between and Story road bridges.\n\nThe Brisbane central business district is the central hub for all public transport services in Brisbane. Bus services are centred on the Queen Street bus station and King George Square busway station. Suburban train services pass through Central railway station, and Roma Street railway station. Roma Street also serves as the terminus for long distance and country services. The central business district is served by various city ferries. Brisbane's CityCat high speed ferry service, popular with tourists and commuters, operates services along the Brisbane River between the University of Queensland and Northshore Hamilton, stopping at several CBD wharves.\n\nThe Brisbane Riverwalk, a pedestrian and cyclist pathway adjoins the central business district along the river bank.\n\nThe Brisbane CBD has featured in a number of films, including:\n\n\n"}

In these mines, children come in contact with minerals, oil and machinery exhaust. In 1997, The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions claimed that child labour was prospering in the diamond industry in Western India, where the majority of the world's diamonds are cut and polished while workers are often paid only a fraction of 1% of the value of the stones they cut. \nIt is argued that economic growth in Western India in the 1980s-90s was associated with an increase in the number of child workers who do simple, repetitive manual tasks that do not require long years of training or experience in low-paying hazardous working conditions that involve drudgery, foreclose the option of school education for most of them.\n\nThere are organizations and people who try to create a public awareness about the issue, including Janine Roberts, The Anti-Slavery Society, Survival International, IndianNGO, Child Labour News Service (CLNS) managed by the Global March Against Child Labor, and IHS Child Slave Labor News.\n\nIn 1997, the International Labour Organization published a report titled \"Child Labour in the Diamond Industry\" claiming that child labour is highly prevalent in the Indian diamond industry. Child labourers constitute nearly 3% of the total workforce and the percentage of child labourers is as high as 25% in the diamond industry of Surat. The ICFTU further claimed that child labour was prospering in the diamond industry in western India, where the majority of the world's diamonds are cut and polished. Workers are often paid only a fraction of 1% of the value of the stones they cut. \n\nPravin Nanavati, a Surat-based diamond businessman argued that, since high cost diamonds could easily be lost or broken while cutting or polishing, employing a child labourer would mean risking \"lakhs of rupees.\" Some western countries have called for a boycott against the diamond industry for establishing a monopoly in the sector. Mohan Dhabuwala, secretary of The South Gujarat Diamond Workers Association, argued that while child labour is highly prevalent in the construction and hotel industries, there are few child labourers in the diamond industry of Surat, less than 1% according to their surveys, mainly because of stern punishments and penalties for violation of child labour laws.\n\nIn 1998, Madhura Swaminathan from the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research argued that economic growth in western India had been associated with an increase in the number of child workers over the previous 15 years and that children worked at simple repetitive manual tasks in low-paying hazardous jobs, foreclosing the option of school education.\n\nIn 2005, an India-based management consultancy firm, A. F. Ferguson & Co., commissioned a study titled \"Child Labour from the Gem and Jewellery Industry\" \"to spread awareness about child labour among the people connected with the industry\". They studied 663 manufacturing units at 21 different locations in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, as an initiative of the Gem & Jewelry Export Promotion Council. On 12 February, the study was presented at a seminar held by the GJEPC and the Surat Diamond Association, in Surat, India. The report argued that the use of child labour in India’s diamond processing industry has been reduced from 0.55% in 1998 to 0.31% in 2005, \"while for the synthetic stone industry it is estimated to be two-thirds less\".\n\nGJEPC chairman Bakul Mehta claimed that, \"some 500 diamond factory owners took an oath in the city of Palanpur, Gujarat, (home town of leading Gujarati diamond merchants) not to employ children in their factories. Similarly, in Surat, 200 factory owners took the oath,\" and that GJEPC \"remain committed to eradicating child labour from the Indian diamond industry”. He argued that \"...the gem and jewelry industry cannot even think of employing children, not only for moral reasons, but that a child could be injured while polishing or cutting the diamonds.\"\n\nOn 28 August 2003, BBC news reported that during the 10-year civil war in Sierra Leone children were used as combatants and child labourers in the diamond mines of Koidu in the north-eastern district of Kono. Children aged between 5 and 16 were used in hard labour, for ten hours a day, \"digging in soil and gravel, before sifting with a pan for gemstones and shifting heavy mud believed to contain diamonds.\" In collaboration with World Vision and Aim Sierra Leone, the Ministry of Gender and Children's Affairs registered 1,200 child miners to get them out of the mines.\n\nOn 26 June 2009, Human Rights Watch published a 62-page report titled \"Diamonds in the Rough. Human Rights Abuses in the Marange Diamond Fields of Zimbabwe\", based on its researchers' \"more than 100 one-on-one interviews with witnesses, local miners, police officers, soldiers, local community leaders, victims and relatives, medical staff, human rights lawyers, and activists in Harare, Mutare, and Marange district in eastern Zimbabwe\", conducted in February 2009. \n\nAccording to the report, \"following the discovery of diamonds in Marange in June 2006, the police and army have used brutal force to control access to the diamond fields and to take over unlicensed diamond mining and trading. Some income from the fields has been funnelled to high-level party members of ZANU-PF, which is now part of a power-sharing government that urgently needs revenue as the country faces a dire economic crisis.\" According to the report, some children work up to eleven hours per day with no pay, and by the estimate of a local lawyer, up to 300 children continue to work for soldiers in the Marange diamond fields.\n\nIn December 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a \"List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor\" that mentioned Angola, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as part of the 74 countries with significant incidence of child labor and forced labor as far as the diamond industry is concerned.\n\nChild Slave Labor News argued that it is reported that in the late 1980s, about 11% and in 1994, 16% of the workforce was underage in diamond industry. \"Currently there are over 171 million children that work in hazardous work sites such as factories and mines.\"\n\nCSLN further argued the diamond mines are dangerous work sites, \"open pits of heavy minerals, oil, machinery exhaust, and any other rubbish seeps into\". It is reported that diamond miners are exposed health risks and hazards, including malaria, dysentery, cholera and sexual diseases. In addition to those diseases, child labourers who are subjected to working in poor conditions including overcrowding, abuse, long work hours and cheap pay in diamond mines suffer from eye strain, headaches, malnutrition, and respiratory problems. While they are paid for how many diamonds they can polish or cut per day. The ordinary amount of money a worker will get for polishing the uppermost section of a diamond is two rupees, which is below eight US cents, while workers who make smaller diamonds, might be paid 15 to 20 US dollars per week. Child slaves in Surat sleep in their workplace or in a small hovel instead of a home. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions has claimed that child labour was prospering in the diamond industry in Western India, where the majority of the world's diamonds are cut and polished while workers are often paid only a fraction of 1% of the value of the stones they cut in 1997.\n\nChild workers are used as slaves since business owners exploit them as cheap employment to raise more profit and diamond industry is \"an infamous venue of exploitation towards youth workers\" like mines and sweatshops in South Africa or India while the diamond is overpriced and funded for wars. The majority of the third world country families are poor therefore rely on their children’s income to survive. Additionally since most children do not have the opportunity to gain an education from their local school system, working at a sweatshop is their only option in life. In other instances, employers pays the family in advance and in turn, the child works to pay off the debt, which is called bonding, yet bonded children cannot pay their family’s debt because of interest. With the increase in owed money, bonded children are forced into a life of servitude which will pass onto their descendants.\n\nOn the other hand, Civil wars usually shut down all government services. Countries like Sierra Leone, which depend on diamonds for much of its economic activity, not only face disruption in production (which reduces the supply), but also a thriving black market in conflict diamonds, which drives down the price for what diamonds are produced.\n\nWhen the mines are located on the land indigenous people including children, they had to be moved to a different area in order to construct a mine to collect gems. In Botswana, a long dispute has existed between the interests of the mining company, De Beers, and the relocation of the Bushman tribe from the land in order to explore diamond resources. The Bushmen have been facing threats from government policies since at least 1980, when the diamond resources were discovered. A campaign is being fought in an attempt to bring an end to what Survival International considers to be a \"genocide\" of a tribe that has been living in those lands for tens of thousands of years. On the grounds that their hunting and gathering has become \"obsolete\" and their presence is no longer compatible with \"preserving wildlife resources\", they were persecuted by the government in order to make them leave the reserve. To get rid of them, they have had their water supplies cut off, they have been taxed, fined, beaten and tortured. Several international supermodels, including Iman, Lily Cole and Erin O'Connor, who were previously involved with advertising for the companies' diamonds, have backed down after realizing the consequences raised by this scandal, and now support the campaign.\n\nOn 4 July 2005 American rap star Kanye West, released a song titled Diamonds from Sierra Leone as the lead single of his second studio album, \"Late Registration\", containing a repeated sample of the theme song for the 1971 James Bond film, \"Diamonds Are Forever\" as performed by Shirley Bassey. The song is revealing the hard life of child workers in Sierra Leone, like other West African nations who since 1991 having been forced to mine conflict diamonds and die in civil wars financed by them: \"Good Morning! This ain't Vietnam. Still, people lose hands, legs, arms for real/Little was known of Sierra Leone, and how it connect to the diamonds we own...\". The music video was directed by Hype Williams and shot entirely in black-and-white in Prague, featuring visuals of young African children toiling away in mines under the careful watch of their wardens with juxtaposed with scenes of wealthy Westerners shopping in boutiques and trying on jewellery.\n\nThe song peaked at number forty-three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, was moderately successful on the iTunes music service, and peaked in the eight spot on the UK Top 40. It won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Song at the 48th Grammy Awards.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The center of downtown is the intersection of 9th and Broadway. The city Christmas tree is located here as well.\n\nDowntown Tacoma's mid-century downturn was exacerbated by the opening of the Tacoma Mall on May 16, 1968. Many of the anchor retail stores left the downtown to relocate to the mall.\n\nFollowing the exodus of retailers to the Tacoma Mall in the late 1960s, city leadership attempted to make downtown more appealing to shoppers by building two large parking garages and by closing off to traffic two blocks of Broadway Street between South 9th and South 11th Streets. The Broadway Mall was less successful than hoped and the street was re-opened to traffic during the 1980s.\n\nLater revitalization efforts were centered around the renovation of Union Station in 1990, which became Tacoma's federal courthouse, coupled with the opening of University of Washington Tacoma. The University of Washington rejected a greenfield site for its new South Puget Sound campus and, instead, decided to restore six historic warehouses in a dilapidated district on the edge of downtown Tacoma. Today, the area is a thriving museum and university district. Retail and restaurants have returned and downtown is undergoing a renaissance. The addition of the Museum of Glass, Tacoma Art Museum, and the Washington State History Museum added much life to the area.\n\nThe Tacoma City Council passed the Local Improvement District for St. Helens Street in April 2006 which was designed to improve areas which have been neglected. The LID is expected to start in 2008. Also central to the revitalization effort has been the city's adoption of the tax exemption for new residential units in multifamily dwellings, primarily apartments and condominiums. Starting in 2002, downtown Tacoma began seeing an increase in the number of residential units being built or renovated downtown.

John Cooke, was a noted Egyptologist and co-founder of \"The Freeman\", a Baptist weekly newspaper.\n\nIn 1863 Ebenezer Cooke was sent out to the colony of South Australia by the English and Australian Copper Company as accountant for their smelting works in St. Vincent Street, Port Adelaide. He took on role of superintendent then (on the death of general manager James Hamilton in 1871) was officially appointed to that position, which he held until \"headhunted\" by the Public Service in 1882. He was replaced by Frederick Ireland who, like Cooke, was promoted from the post of Accountant.\n\nOn 1 March 1875 he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as member for Flinders, encompassing northern towns such as Port Augusta and Port Pirie with colleagues Patrick Boyce Coglin and John Williams. In 1878 he was re-elected for the same district, with William Ranson Mortlock taking the place of Williams. In 1881 Cooke was once more successful, his fellow-members being Mortlock and A. Tennant.\nOn 31 July 1879 he was appointed chairman of the Royal Commission on Finance, which ran for nearly three years. The Commission's final report, dated 2 May 1882, recommended the creation of an Audit Office with two Commissioners of Audit. These recommendations were accepted with Cooke and Alfred Heath appointed to the top jobs.

It deals with the professional responsibilities of mathematicians whose work influences decisions with major consequences, such as in law, finance, the military, and environmental science.\n\nMathematicians in industrial, scientific, military and intelligence roles crucially influence decisions with large consequences. For example, complex calculations were needed for the success of the Manhattan Project, while the overextended use of the Gaussian copula formula to price derivatives before the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 has been called \"the formula that killed Wall Street\", and the theory of global warming depends on the reliability of mathematical models of climate. For the same reason as in medical ethics and engineering ethics, the high impact of the consequences of decisions imposes serious ethical obligations on practitioners to consider the rights and wrongs of their advice and decisions.\n\nThese illustrate the major consequences of numerical mistakes and hence the need for ethical care.\n\nMathematicians in professional roles in finance and similar work have a particular responsibility to ensure they use the best methods and data to reach the right answer, as the prestige of mathematics is high and others rely on mathematical results which they cannot fully understand. Other ethical issues are shared with information economy professionals in general, such as duty of care, confidentiality of information, whistleblowing, and avoiding conflict of interest.\n\nMuch of mathematics as used in applications involves the drawing of conclusions from quantitative data. It is recognised that there are many difficulties in reaching and communicating such conclusions accurately, honestly and with due regard to the uncertainties that remain. It is easy for a statistician to mislead clients whose understanding of data and inference is less developed, so statisticians have professional responsibilities to act fairly.\n\nThe American Mathematical Society publishes a code of ethical guidelines for mathematical researchers. The responsibilities of researchers include being knowledgeable in the field, avoiding plagiarism and giving credit, to publish without unreasonable delay, and to correct errors. The European Mathematical Society Ethics Committee also publishes a code of practice relating to the publication, editing and refereeing of research.\n\nIt has been argued that as pure mathematical research is relatively harmless, it raises few urgent ethical issues. However, that raises the question of whether and why pure mathematics is ethically worth doing, given that it consumes the lives of many highly intelligent people who could be making more immediately useful contributions.\n\nCourses in the ethics of mathematics remain rare. The University of New South Wales taught a compulsory course on Professional Issues and Ethics in Mathematics in its mathematics degrees from 1998 to 2012.\n\n\n"}

He is the founder of the hair products company Black Like Me He is famous in South Africa for his life story: growing up and struggling against poverty and the Apartheid government to open his own hair business, which became the biggest hair brand in South Africa, making him a millionaire. He publicly backed Mmusi Maimane in the Democratic Alliance leadership race. He also wrote the book \"Black Like You\" which is his autobiography. Philosophically, he is a libertarian and \"capitalist crusader\" whose highest value is \"individual freedom.\"\n\nOn August 22, 2016, Mashaba was elected Mayor of Johannesburg by the first sitting of council following countrywide local government elections.\n\nMashaba was brought up in near-poverty in GaRamotse in Hammanskraal, Gauteng, by his sisters while his absent domestic-worker mother worked to provide for the family.\n\nHis older brother dropped out of school at 15, going from one unsubstantial job to another. Mashaba realised that an education would be crucial for him to break out of the cycle of poverty. He graduated from high school, but did not complete his tertiary education.\n\nFrom a young age he was a strategic thinker - he bought a car without having a license and drove out of the dealership without ever having learned to drive. He drove himself from one selling job to another, in the process confirming for himself that he was a natural salesman with an unswerving instinct for business. He started selling \"SuperKurl\" African hair-care products and became their number-one earner. He soon realised that these products excited him and that he wasn't content to be just an employee. (Reference: Book titled \"South Africa's Greatest Entrepreneurs\", compiled by Moky Makura, article written by Isabella Morris)\n\nHis company, \"Black Like Me\", was launched on Valentine’s Day in 1985 with a loan from his friend, businessman Walter Dube.\n\nMashaba is also a music lover. After five years of secret lessons, he revealed himself as a pianist.\n\nFrom 2012 until May 2014, Mashaba served as chairman of the Free Market Foundation (FMF). He stepped down from his position when he joined the Democratic Alliance as an \"ordinary card-carrying member\", citing the need for the Foundation to remain politically impartial.\n\nMashaba announced in December 2015 that he would accept a nomination to stand as a Democratic Alliance mayoral candidate for the City of Johannesburg in the 2016 local government elections. The other possible DA candidate was Rabelani Dagada.\n\nIn the municipal election on August 3, 2016, the ruling party, The African National Congress, lost their majority in Johannesburg, taking only 44.12% of the vote with the Democratic alliance taking 38.33%. The Democratic Alliance entered into conversations with the Economic Freedom Fighters to form a coalition. Whilst the EFF declined the offer, they agreed that they would vote for Mashaba as the Mayor for Johannesburg, despite misgivings.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, Mashaba was sworn in as a Johannesburg City Councillor. Later that day, he was sworn in as the Mayor of Johannesburg, the first non-ANC Johannesburg mayor since 1994.\n\nMashaba has characterised the ANC's post-Apartheid labour laws as \"draconian\".\n\nHe led a Constitutional Court challenge by the FMF, arguing that Section 32 of the Labour Relations Act is unconstitutional. The FMF argued that the bargaining council process reduces competition, as smaller businesses may not be able to afford the higher wages agreed on between larger businesses and unions, contributing further to South Africa's unemployment rate.\n\n"}

He is the beneficiary of numerous discretionary trust assets said by the US Government to originate from payments out of the Malaysian 1MDB fund. He gained notoriety as a \"tabloid party boy\" in New York City. Low has been associated with numerous dubious high value transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, luxury real estate and art, as well as philanthropy.\n\nLow grew up in George Town, on Penang Island. His grandfather Low Meng Tak was a businessman born in Guangdong in China. Meng Tak had interests in iron-ore mining and liquor distilleries in Thailand in the 1960s and 1970s, and in real estate in Thailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Jho Low's father Tan Sri Larry Low Hock Peng founded investment holding company MWE Holdings.\n\nLow was the youngest of three children. He attended Chung Ling High School and The International School of Penang (Uplands) before being sent to the elite Harrow School in London. In London, he developed a \"close relationship\" with Riza Aziz, the stepson of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. He then enrolled in the undergraduate program of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School, where he continued to develop connections with Malaysians as well as Kuwaiti and Jordanian interests and began managing money for his friends and family.\n\nLow can speak Malay, English, Cantonese, Hokkien and Teochew.\n\nAlthough earlier in his career, Low had often claimed to be investing and making purchases on behalf of other investors or \"friends\", in 2015 Low suggested that his family had considerable independent means. While a 2015 New York Times article suggested that his family was of \"somewhat deflated affluence,\" a 2014 Wall Street Journal profile had called him a \"scion.\"\n\nLow's first major deal was the Kuwait Finance House's 2006 purchase for US$87 million of a luxury high-rise apartment building in Kuala Lumpur. According to the New York Times, \"[b]y 2007, [Low] had formed an investment group that included a Malaysian prince, a Kuwaiti sheikh and a friend from the United Arab Emirates who went on to become ambassador to the United States and Mexico.\" By 2010, the family had consolidated its fortune into Jynwel Capital, of which Low and older brother Szen Low were the principal stewards.\n\nAs steward of Jynwel, Low cultivated relationships with some of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, including Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Development Co and the Kuwait Investment Authority. Jynwel is connected with deals including the acquisition of New York's Park Lane Hotel for US$660 million in 2013 with The Witkoff Group and Mubadala; the takeover of Coastal Energy in 2014 for US$2.2 billion; and the buyout of EMI's music publishing business in 2012 for US$2.2 billion with the Blackstone Group, Sony Corporation and Mubadala. Low was the architect for Jynwel Capital's unsuccessful US$2.2 billion bid to buy Reebok from Adidas AG in October 2014.\n\nLow advises Aziz in the management of Red Granite Pictures, a Hollywood production company responsible for films such as \"Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Dumb and Dumber To\". Recovery of the rights in both movies were the subject of actions for recovery by the US Government in 2013 and 2016, respectively, as procured from the alleged proceeds of misappropriation of funds.\n\nNajib Razak gained the post of Malaysian Prime Minister in 2009. Soon, he became president of the board of advisers for 1MDB, the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund. Although Low never received an official position, he admits that he occasionally \"consulted\" with 1MDB, and was involved in a number of transactions connecting his own interests with those of 1MDB. \n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" has reported that a $33.5 million condominium in Manhattan was owned by a shell company under control of Low's family trust, and then was transferred to a shell company controlled by Razak's stepson. Another \"home in Beverly Hills known as the pyramid house for a gold pyramid in its garden\" was owned by a shell company controlled by the Low family trust, and was transferred to Razak's stepson by simply transferring control of the shell company to him.\n\nIn October 2016, Interpol published a red notice at Singapore's request to locate Jho Low in an investigation related to 1MDB fund flows within its jurisdiction.\n\nAfter the Malaysian general election in 2018, Malaysia renewed investigations into the 1MDB scandal and issued arrest warrants against Low and former SRC International director, Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil.\n\nAccording to South China Morning Post reports, Jho Low is still involved in affairs of his Hong Kong companies. He signed documents for private equity firm Jynwel Capital and non-profit group Jynwel Charitable Foundation in July 2018, even though he is on the run from Malaysian authorities looking to arrest him in connection with the 1MDB scandal. He has repeatedly tried to arrange for an immunity deal, but the Malaysian government has consistently refused him.\n\nLow allegedly purchased a US$325,000 (over RM1 million) white Ferrari as a wedding gift for Kim Kardashian in 2011. The Department of Justice (DoJ) had reportedly also gone after the other famous celebrities who had received gifts from Low, among the list are Leonardo DiCaprio, who has since returned the Picasso and Basquiat paintings; and Miranda Kerr who returned diamond jewellery in the market value of US$8 million.\n\nIn June 2017, the US Government, in civil proceedings brought against certain assets in the Central District of California, sought return of US$540 million worth of assets derived from an alleged $4.5 billion misappropriation from the Malaysian 1MDB wealth fund. On 1 November 2018, Low and two ex-Goldman Sachs bankers were charged by the US Department of Justice with money laundering in connection with the alleged 1MDB misappropriation.\n\nConsistent with his personal connections to the Razak family, Low supported the Prime Minister during the 2013 elections. He organised a free pro-government concert in his home state of Penang, featuring American musicians Busta Rhymes and Ludacris and was criticised as unfair electioneering by the local, opposition government.\n\nLow is romantically linked to socialite Paris Hilton, Taiwanese singer Elva Hsiao and supermodel Miranda Kerr. Low gained early notoriety by spending extravagant sums in New York and Las Vegas parties, as well as a luxurious MYR 5.5 million boyfriend proposal to Hsiao.\n\nLow's philanthropy began after a reported cancer scare in 2012. He then founded Jynwel Foundation to honour the Low family tradition, started by his grandfather, of financing schools, hospitals and community centres in his hometown. Low's grandfather died from cancer in 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Jynwel Foundation committed US$50 million over 12 years to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the hospital where Jho Low spent six months recovering from his infection and cancer scare. The funds were to begin a pilot program using IBM's Watson question answering computer system as a clinical decision support system in cancer. The plan was to acquire, analyse and organise vast amounts of data to help physicians determine the most promising treatments for cancer patients.\n\nLow, on behalf of the Jynwel Foundation, underwrote Alicia Keys' Keep A Child Alive's annual flagship fundraiser event in New York City from 2012 to 2015. He donated $250,000 to the organisation in 2013 to expand its HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nLow committed US$25 million over 15 years to the humanitarian news service IRIN on behalf of the Jynwel Foundation in November 2014, a step intended to fill a funding gap after the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs withdrew support in 2014.\n"}

His parents were William Brockenbrough and Judith Robinson White Brockenbrough. His sister was Judith White Brockenbrough McGuire, who wrote \"Diary of a Southern Refugee, During the War, By a Lady of Virginia\". He was a first cousin of William Henry Brockenbrough.\n\nHe attended the College of William and Mary and the University of Virginia before he studied at the Winchester Law School under Henry St. George Tucker. Others studying with Tucker at that time included William L. Goggin and Henry A. Wise. Brockenbrough was born in Hanover County, Virginia and served briefly as Commonwealth's Attorney for Hanover County.\n\nIn 1837, he published two volumes of reports, containing the decisions of John Marshall's federal circuit court opinions. He was also the editor of the \"Lexington Valley Star\" in Rockbridge County, Virginia.\n\nBrockenbrough established the Lexington Law School in 1849. His law students included John J. Davis, John Goode and Robert Murphy Mayo. In his introductory address to the first class of incoming students, Brockenbrough offered this advice:\nSooner or later the occasion will arise when you will appear before the dread tribunal of the public. Let us suppose that the time for the trial of your strength has now arrived. You are called to participate in the management of a cause which excites a profound public interest. A natural curiosity is felt to hear the maiden speech of the young lawyer! People have scarcely yet learned to look upon you as a man. Little is therefore expected of you, but you have had time for preparation, and you have used it well. You have anticipated every possible phase which the case can assume, and you are ready with your authorities to sustain all your positions. The eager crowd closes around you. They listen with surprised delight at the display of your learning and ingenuity, now enraptured with your splendid bursts of indignant eloquence, now melted into pity by some master stroke of touching pathos. With what a greedy ear they drink in those \"words that burn, those thoughts that breathe!\" You sit down overpowered by your own emotion. An audible murmer of approbation runs through that delighted throng! The cause is ended, the victory is won! Clients now pour in upon you, who before had none. You have made a great impression. Your reputation is now established on a firm basis, and the voice of hissing envy shall not retard your onward march. My friends, this is no fancy sketch. We are told by Mr. Butler in his \"Reminiscences,\" that a celebrated English lawyer of the last century had said, that so sudden was his rise at the Bar, that he never knew the difference between having no income at all, and one of £3,000 sterling a year. A single great speech had established his reputation on an imperishable foundation. Who shall say that a like brilliant destiny may not be reserved for some of you, in the unwritten history of the future?\nIn 1852, Brockenbrough was elected to the board of trustees of what is now Washington & Lee University (then Washington College), which had previously honored him with a Doctor of Laws degree in 1851. As Rector from 1865–1872, he was the one to approach Robert E. Lee with the trustees' proposal to make Lee president of the College.\n\nBrockenbrough was nominated by James K. Polk on December 23, 1845, to the seat vacated by Isaac S. Pennybacker on the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 14, 1846, and received commission the same day. He was also a professor of law at Lexington Law School, Lexington, Virginia, from 1849 to 1861.\n\nAlong with John Tyler, William C. Rives, James Seddon, and George W. Summers, Brockenbrough represented Virginia at the peace conference of 1861. When the War began, Brockenbrough resigned from his judicial position. Abraham Lincoln nominated John Jay Jackson, Jr., to replace Brockenbrough in the Western District in 1861. During the War, Judge Brockenbrough served as the Confederate district judge for Western Virginia, and was a member of the Congress of the Confederate States.\n\nAfter the War, he returned to teaching law. In 1866, Robert E. Lee, as president of Washington College, invited Judge Brockenbrough to join his Lexington Law School with Washington College, and continue to teach as Professor of Law and Equity. In 1868, Brockenbrough was a member of a five-man committee in Lexington which called for \"a White Man's party, based on the single principal [sic] that the white man alone has the right to vote.\" In 1870, John Randolph Tucker, son of Henry St. George Tucker, was hired to teach law along with Brockenbrough. Brockenbrough resigned in 1873, in a dispute over salary. He died four years later in Lexington, at the age of seventy.\n\n"}

It is issued by the King Committee on Corporate Governance. Three reports were issued in 1994 (King I), 2002 (King II), and 2009 (King III) and a fourth revision (King IV) in 2016. The Institute of Directors in Southern Africa (IoDSA) owns the copyright of the King Report on Corporate Governance and the King Code of Corporate Governance. Compliance with the King Reports is a requirement for companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The King Report on Corporate Governance has been cited as \"the most effective summary of the best international practices in corporate governance\".\n\nIn July 1993 the Institute of Directors in South Africa asked retired Supreme Court of South Africa judge Mervyn E. King to chair a committee on corporate governance. He viewed this as an opportunity to educate the newly democratic South African public on the working of a free economy. The committee's report was to be the first report of its kind in South Africa.\n\nCommittee members included Phillip Armstrong, Nigel Payne, and Richard Wilkinson.\n\nUnlike other corporate governance codes such as Sarbanes-Oxley, the code is non-legislative and is based on principles and practices. It also espouses an apply or explain approach, unique to the Netherlands until King and now also found in the 2010 Combined Code from the United Kingdom.\n\nThe philosophy of the code consists of the three key elements of leadership, sustainability and good corporate citizenship. It views good governance as essentially being effective, ethical leadership. King believes that leaders should direct the company to achieve sustainable economic, social and environmental performance. It views sustainability as the primary moral and economic imperative of this century; the code's view on corporate citizenship flows from a company's standing as a juristic person under the South African constitution and should operate in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn 1994 the first King report on corporate governance (King 1) was published, the first corporate governance code for South Africa. It established recommended standards of conduct for boards and directors of listed companies, banks, and certain state-owned enterprises. It included not only financial and regulatory aspects, but also advocated an integrated approach that involved all stakeholders.\n\nIt was applicable to all companies listed on the main board of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, large public entities as defined by the Public Entities Act of South Africa; banks, financial and insurance companies as defined by the Financial Services Acts of South Africa; and large unlisted companies. It defined \"large\" as companies with shareholder equity over R50 million, but encouraged all companies to adopt the code.\n\nThe key principles from the first King report covered: \n\nIn 2002, when the Earth Summit was held in Johannesburg, King pushed for a revision of the report (King II), including new sections on sustainability, the role of the corporate board, and risk management. This revised code of governance was applicable from March 2002.\nIn addition to those types of organizations listed in King I, it was applicable to departments of State or national, provincial or local government administration falling under the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Act, and public institution or functionary exercising a power or performing a function in terms of the constitution, or exercising a public power or performing a public function in terms of any legislation, excluding courts or judicial officers. As before, it encourages all companies to adopt the applicable principles from the code.\n\nThe key principles from the second King report covered the following areas:\n\nAs before, the code is not enforced through legislation. However, it co-exists with a number of laws that apply to companies and directors including the Companies Act. In addition further enforcement takes place by regulations such as the JSE Securities Exchange Listings Requirements.\n\nIn an interview with Mervin King, he considered the King II report was wrong to include sustainability as a separate chapter, leading companies to report on it separately from other factors. In the next version, the 2009 King III report, governance, strategy and sustainability were integrated. The report recommends that organisations produce an integrated report in place of an annual financial report and a separate sustainability report and that companies create sustainability reports according to the Global Reporting Initiative's Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.\n\nIn contrast to the earlier versions, King III is applicable to all entities, public, private and non-profit. King encourages all entities to adopt the King III principles and explain how these have been applied or are not applicable. The code of governance was applicable from March 2010.\n\nThe report incorporated a number of global emerging governance trends:\n\nIt also incorporated a number of new principles to address elements not previously included in the King reports:\n\nAgain, the code of corporate governance is not enforced through legislation. However, due to evolutions in South African law many of the principles put forward in King II are now embodied as law in the Companies Act of South Africa of 2008. In addition to the Companies Act, there are additional applicable statutes that encapsulate some of the principles of King III such as the Public Finance Management Act and the Promotion of Access to Information Act.\n\n\n\"There have been significant corporate governance and regulatory developments, locally and internationally, since King III was issued in 2009 which need to be taken into account. The other consideration is that whilst listed companies are generally applying King III, non-profit organisations, private companies and entities in the public sector have experienced challenges in interpreting and adapting King III to their particular circumstances. The enhancement will aim to make King IV more accessible to all types of entities across sectors.\"\n\nKing IV was published on 1 November 2016. Providing for a 2-year period in respect of the drafting process and another year grace period to allow organisations to implement, King IV will probably become effective from middle 2017.\n\nThe Institute of Directors in Southern Africa (IoDSA) is the custodian of the King reports and the holder of their copyrights. Ansie Ramalho from the IoDSA, with the assistance of Parmi Natesan and Julie Dixon, leads the project management of the redrafting process and serves as the editor of the various drafts. The King Committee governs the drafting process and will ultimately approve of the King IV Report.\n"}

He is credited for inventing the \"knuckleboom\" hydraulic loader, an invention that propelled the Prentice loader to 51% of the worldwide market.\n\nHeikkinen was born the third child in a family of ten in Brantwood, WI. He graduated from Tripoli High School in 1935, married his wife Norma in 1941, worked in Milwaukee, WI for the Koehring Company, and returned to Price County in 1945 where he made the town of Prentice his home.  Heikkinen had four children with his wife Norma. He died on Friday, Sept. 10, 1999.\n\nIn 1959, after running Heikkinen Machine Shop with his brothers for over a decade, Heikkinen incorporated Prentice Hydraulics. With Prentice Hydraulics, Heikkinen excelled due to selling his knuckleboom loader, a revolutionary design for pulpwood loaders that allowed a single operator to load a truck through a design that featured essentially a “yo-yo” and “claw” versus manually wrapping logs with a cable or worse, loading the logs by hand. The company began with 35 employees and grew to 340 employees and $9 million in sales prior to its sale to Omark Industries in 1967.\n\nIn 1970, Heikkinen founded Multitek North America, LLC which focused primarily on machines to process firewood, conveyors, wheel-crusher and attachments for skid steers. Multitek was in the Heikkinen family (first owned and operated by Leo and then by his three sons) until 2006 when it was sold to a Wisconsin-based investment group. Doug Kamps became the first President of Multitek North America, LLC under the new owners.\n\nHeikkinen was heavily involved in community projects around Prentice, WI. His donations included a community center, community park and pond, high school athletic fields, lights and equipment, a house for the town’s first doctor, land for the village’s first dental office. He also built and donated the Village of Prentice Municipal Golf Course and the Village of Prentice Airport.

In October 1814, Lt. Col.

Bache was court-martialed and was dismissed from U.S. military service. The military court decided not to punish Bache further because the court believed Bache's closing arguments...that he acted in good faith based upon Governor Snyder's orders, his motives were pure, and that trust was placed in him by his soldiers and the soldiers' parents who allowed their sons to volunteer only under the command of trusted state militia officers.

It is a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, which is a New York state public-benefit corporation.\n\nThe Lower Manhattan Development Corporation was formed in November 2001 by then-Governor George Pataki and then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The LMDC is a joint State-City corporation governed by a 16-member Board of Directors, half appointed by the Governor of New York and half by the Mayor of New York. As a result, Pataki and Giuliani appointees dominate the LMDC. Its original chairman was John C. Whitehead, a former Deputy Secretary of State and head of Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn February 2003, the LMDC chose Daniel Libeskind's master plan for the reconstruction of the World Trade Center complex. The organization also sponsored the international design competition for the World Trade Center Memorial, which resulted in Michael Arad and Peter Walker's \"Reflecting Absence\" being chosen as the winning design in January 2004.\n\nHaving distributed its funds, the LMDC in July 2006 announced plans to dissolve and transfer its responsibilities to other existing agencies and foundations, including the W.T.C. Memorial Foundation, and the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center.\n\nLMDC does not own the World Trade Center site and this has created some problems in its dealings with Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Larry Silverstein, who has a lease to the site.\n\nThe LMDC was funded through the disbursement of Community Development Block Grants-amounting to $2.783 billion—approved by the federal government in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and resultant destruction of much of lower Manhattan's economic and structural base. It was not listed in the New York State Authorities Budget Office's 2018 annual report, and so it may be dissolved or it may have chosen not to report for 2017.\n\nTwo members of the LMDC's board have asserted that up to $45 million allocated to the LMDC from a \"community enhancement\" fund in May 2005 has not been directly accounted for, and that up to $15 million from that stipend might have been spent in areas other than those it had been explicitly stipulated for.\n\nFormer Attorney General Democrat Eliot Spitzer became governor in 2007, rethought his condemnation, and announced a \"reinvigorated LMDC\" that would continue the revitalization of Lower Manhattan. Mayor Bloomberg welcomed the Governor's renewed interest at the time. However, in September 2008, Mayor Bloomberg condemned the LMDC as a contributor to a slower progress in rebuilding and he demanded dissolution of the LMDC.\n\nThe LMDC obtained a patent for one of its 9/11 Memorial endeavors in 2005. \"Engraving for a National Memorial\", U.S. Patent D506,860, designed by Michael Anthony Stahl of Huntsville, AL. was registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on June 28, 2005.\n\n\n"}

He later described his father Abram Abramowitz, a journeyman bootmaker, shopkeeper, and house agent, as a 'philosophical anarchist'. \n\nAbrams received a scholarship to attend The Latymer School, then read economics at the London School of Economics. He went on to complete a PhD in early modern English economic history under the supervision of R. H. Tawney in 1929.\n\nBetween 1931-1933 Abrams was a research fellow at the progressive Brookings Institution in Washington, DC. In 1933 he joined the research department of the London Press Exchange, one of Britain's leading advertising agencies. Here Abrams began developing his pioneering work in social investigation, market research, and opinion polling by conducting large-scale statistical surveys into consumer behaviour. His national newspaper readership surveys, which included over 20,000 participants between 1934-38, were landmarks in survey research and were credited with establishing the widespread use of the ABC1 system of social classification in Britain. Abrams's contacts with other social scientists working abroad during this period led to his work retrieving refugees from Nazi Europe (in 1939 helping Sigmund Freud make his final move to England).\n\nDuring World War Two Abrams was employed first in the BBC Overseas Research Department, then at the Psychological Warfare Board, where he carried out government surveys into working-class diets under rationing and the impact of bombing on civilian morale, and also commissioned covert psychological analysis into the mind of Adolf Hitler. His studies of food consumption during the war contributed to the establishment of the National Food Survey in 1940.\n\nAbrams returned to the London Press Exchange in 1946 to direct its research department as an independent subsidiary consultancy, Research Services Ltd. By the early 1960s the company employed over ninety members of staff and produced surveys for 300 clients a year, including academic as well as commercial, political, and public sector organisations. Research Services Ltd. was commissioned to undertake social surveys prior to the building of Peterlee new town and the establishment of The Sun newspaper. Abrams, along with contemporary pollsters such as Henry Durant of the British Institute of Public Opinion, gained a reputation as an expert authority on market research and mass communication techniques in Britain, and published widely in academic journals as well as newspapers and the popular press. Two of his most influential market research reports coined the phrase 'teenage consumer', drawing attention to the new significance of a rapidly expanding youth market for products and advertising. Abrams was one of the founding members of the Market Research Society and an advisor of the Consumers' Association. Research Services Ltd. (later known as RSL) was one of the founder companies of Ipsos MORI.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s Abrams became closely connected with the Labour Party and carried out many of their private opinion polls, first with the modernisers in the party aligned with Hugh Gaitskell and then Harold Wilson, for whom he worked on the development of Labour's publicity campaign for the 1964 general election.\n\nAbrams left his chairmanship of Research Services Limited in 1970 to become Director of the Survey Research Unit at the Social Science Research Council, under Michael Young. Between 1971 and 1975 he worked on the 'Quality of Life in Britain' surveys, which included the innovative use of 'subjective social indicators' to track perceptions of social change. Between 1976-1985, Abrams was Research Director at the Age Concern Institute of Gerontology, King's College London, where he undertook studies of living standards among people aged 65 and over. He was also Vice-President of the Policy Studies Institute between 1978-1994.\n\n\n"}

However, he decided to return home to help with his ailing father’s West Auckland-based family wine business.\n\nAfter a family disagreement over the direction of the wine company, he decided to go into business for himself to form Calypso Beverage Company Ltd in 1987. This business evolved to Independent Liquor.\n\nThe business success relied upon alternative marketing strategies to combat the larger players in the NZ alcohol industry. Part of these tactics was to incent their retail customers, helping them with increased margins the big companies wouldn’t provide.\n\nIndependent Liquor would quickly rise to the 3rd largest liquor distributor in New Zealand and had a 65% share of the market for RTD’s in 2005.

He is also the author of \"Ablyazov against Nazarbayev\".\n\nAblyazov is alleged to have embezzled $6 billion from BTA Bank while serving as chairman. From July 2013 to December 2016, Ablyazov was detained by French authorities, as Russia sought Ablyazov's extradition from France, but Ablyazov argued that extradition would place him at risk of ill-treatment and an unfair trial. Human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as many members of the European Parliament, wrote in opposition to extradition of Ablyazov. In 2015, a French court in Lyon issued an extradition order. However, in December 2016, France's highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, canceled the extradition order, on the ground that Russia had a political motive in making the extradition request. Ablyazov was released from the Fleury-Mérogis Prison. \nLatvian MEP Iveta Grigule-Pēterse warned European Union NGOs and advocacy groups to scrutinize the source of the funds or donations received, citing Ablyazov's use of allegedly embezzled BTA Bank funds to underwrite PR campaigns to minimize Ablyazov's fraud and to present Ablysov as a political dissident. \n\nIn 1986, Ablyazov graduated from the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. There he earned a degree in theoretical physics. After graduation, he worked as a junior researcher at the Kazakh National University.\n\nIn 1987, Ablyazov married Alma Shalabayeva.\n\nIn 1990, Ablyazov was enrolled in postgraduate studies in the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute. For that reason, he was fired from his role as a junior researcher at the Kazakh National University.\n\nAblyazov started working during the fall of the Soviet Union and the start of Kazakhstan's Independence. His first job was the buying and selling of computers and copying machines. In 1991, Ablyazov registered his first company and called it \"Madina,\" which is the name of his first daughter.\n\nIn 1992, Ablyazov started his business by supplying all the regions of Kazakhstan with products such as salt, sugar, flower, matches, tea, chocolate, and medicine. In order to run this business, Ablyazov established Astana Holding in Kazakhstan, a multi-sector private holding company, which established and consisted of: Astana-Sugar, Astana-Food, Aral-Salt, The Shymkent Pasta Factory, Astana-Medical Service, Astana-Motors, Astana-Interotel, Astana-Bank, Trade House Zhanna (furniture).\n\nIn 1997, Ablyazov was appointed as head of the state-owned Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating Company. KEGOC was a company close to buncruptcy at the time of his appointment as its head. In one year, he managed to make the state-owned company profitable.\n\nIn 1998, as head of KEGOC, Ablyazov was named Minister for Energy, Industry, and Trade.\n\nAblyazov has been described by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) as “part of a younger generation” that Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, “hoped to harness as he pushed his resource-rich nation into the 21st century.” Yet after a few years, “Ablyazov and the others had broken ranks, citing disenchantment with endemic corruption in Nazarbayev's inner circle.”\n\nIn 1998, together with a consortium of Kazakh investors, Ablyazov acquired a loan to buy the shares in Bank Turan Alem in a privatization auction for $72 million. He later paid back the loan. The bank later came to be known as BTA Bank.\n\nAblyazov served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of BTA Bank from 2005 to 2009. During Ablyazov's leadership, BTA Bank reported dynamic growth, and became one of the most promising banks in the CIS. By 2008, BTA Bank had grown to become the leader in the emerging markets, the fourth-largest bank among the CIS countries, and one of the three fastest-growing banks in the world. In 2007, \"Euromoney\" magazine named BTA Bank the best bank in Central Asia and in 2008 BTA Bank received the Global Finance award.\n\nAt the same time, between 2006 and 2008, Mukhtar Ablyazov had been pressured by the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to transfer 50% of shares of BTA Bank to the state. Ablyazov refused to transfer the bank's assets into the control of Nazarbayev, and, as a result, in February 2009, the bank was nationalised under the pretext of the need to save the banking sector from bankruptcy.\n\nIn 2008, BTA Bank was the largest commercial financial institution in Kazakhstan, with internal reserves allowing for cooperation with foreign and domestic owners of the shares. At the same time, BTA Bank was the largest creditor of the Kazakh economy – the bank owned about 30% of all the loans granted to legal entities. The control over BTA Bank has been illegally adopted by the National Welfare Fund ‘Samruk-Kazyna’, a holding company owned entirely by the state, despite the healthy condition of the bank. Timur Kulibayev, Nazarbayev’s son-in-law, was the president of this fund.\n\nIn 2010 a US bankruptcy judge granted BTA Bank Chapter 15 protection while it worked to restructure $11.6 billion owed to foreign creditors as a result of loans made while Ablyazov was chairman.\n\nIn September 2009, Kazakhstan's sovereign wealth fund, Samruk-Kazyna, injected significant funds into BTA in an effort to keep the bank solvent, effectively becoming its majority shareholder. Shortly before Samruk-Kazyna's intervention Ablyazov fled Kazakhstan to London.\n\nWhile Chairman of BTA Bank, Ablyazov is alleged to have embezzled or misappropriated up to $6 billion into shell companies and offshore bank accounts. Ablyazov's case is one of the largest financial fraud cases in history. Ablyazov stated that BTA Bank assets were concealed to guard against forced nationalization. Judge Sir Nigel John Martin Teare said that Ablyazov had committed a “fraud on an epic scale” through use of offshore holding companies.\n\nINTERPOL issued a Red Notice arrest warrant for Ablyazov, which was basis for his arrest by French authorities in 2013. Interpol said Ablyazov was wanted in Russia on separate charges for \"large scale fraud,” money laundering and document forgery. Interpol withdrew the red notice in July 2017.\n\n24 March 2009 BTA Bank launched legal proceedings against Ablyazov in the UK High Court shortly after his arrival in London.\n\nAblyazov was the subject of seven legal claims in the English High Court totalling $3.7 billion (£2.26 billion).\n\nThe first decision that Ablyazov lost in the UK courts was passed down by William Blair, brother of Tony Blair. Shortly after, Tony Blair was hired by Nazarbayev to be an economic advisor. Tony Blair was paid a multi-million dollar salary.\n\nIn October 2010, Ablyazov lost a legal fight to prevent his assets from being subject to a receivership order. The ruling came after Justice Teare stated that Ablyazov “cannot be trusted” not to dissipate his assets prior to trial.\n\nAblyazov argued, in his defense, that the takeover of BTA Bank by Samruk-Kazyna in February 2009 was “the culmination of the campaign by President Nazarbayev and his allies to wrest ownership and control of [BTA] from [Ablyazov].”\n\nIn a May 2011 letter, Ablyazov accused Nazarbaev and his advisor Bulat Utemuratov of being the real owners of a 48.73% share in Kazzinc, a firm that Glencore International was planning to buy at the time. Ablyazov wrote that “in 2005-2009, when Mr. Utemuratov was blackmailing me on behalf of” Nazarbaev, demanding a share in BTA Bank, “he asked me to transfer the stocks to the companies that control KazZink now.” Ablyazov said that he had testified to this effect in a London court. Ablyazov was granted asylum in the UK in July 2011, a recognition that he would face political persecution if sent back to Kazakhstan. \nKazakhstan's request for his extradition was ignored. According to the Daily Telegraph, the Kazakh government threatened to punish British firms by awarding lucrative contracts to China if the UK granted Ablyazov asylum.\n\nIn early 2012, Kazakh authorities sought to impliciate Ablyazov in an alleged terror plot. One report suggested that an “obvious reason for trying to nail Ablyazov” was that “unlike other political figures in exile, he has a presence inside Kazakhstan through his links to an opposition group and local media outlets.” The accusation was, according to this report, “designed to tarnish his reputation – and that of his associates, too – in the eyes of the international community,” as well as to provide “a useful distraction from the embarrassment which the government suffered after violence in the western town of Janaozen in December [2011], in which its police force is accused of opening fire on protesters, killing 14 and injuring over 100.” The report said that “authorities seem dead set on eliminating Ablyazov’s capacity to exert any influence in Kazakstan (sic).”\n\nIn November 2012, a U.K. court ordered Mukhtar Ablyazov to pay £1.02 bln ($1.63 bln) plus interest. The court also ordered \"new post-judgment asset-freezing orders be made against Mr. Ablyazov in an unlimited sum and new asset-freezing orders in relation to certain other defendants.\"\n\nThe High Court made judgment upon Ilyas Khrapunov to pay damages of US$500m (US$424,110,000 + interest of US$75,851,783.01) for conspiring with Ablyazov to move assets in breach of the freezing order.\n\nMukhtar Ablyazov was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2017. An appeals court upheld the indictment for criminal conspiracy, embezzlement and money laundering.\n\nCity of Almaty, Kazahkstan v. Mukhtar Ablyazov was filed on July 9, 2015 in the Southern District of New York federal court with Judge Alison Julie Nathan presiding. Court documents show that the Plaintiffs are seeking to depose Ablyazov in New York, the UK, Spain or France, and that Ablyazov has not yet produced documents in discovery effectively stonewalling the court.\n\nA 2015 suit to recover embezzled funds was filed in the Southern District of New York listing Ablyazov, Viktor Khrapunov, Joseph Chetrit and The Chetrit Group as defendants. The suit alleged that the Chetrit Group helped Ablyazov and Khrapunov hide $40 million in two condo conversion projects. The Chetrit Group went on to settle with the Plaintiffs (the city of Almaty and BTA Bank) and became witnesses for the prosecution.\n\nWhile Ablyazov was BTA Chairman, the bank partnered on investment projects in Georgia with the Silk Road Group, a company with a history of alleged financial fraud and money laundering. During Ablyazov's chairmanship, and at the time of alleged financial mismanagement, BTA Bank loans were made to Silk Road Group projects or Silk Road Group owned-companies. In 2014 Silk Road Group collaborated with former BTA Bank executive Yerkin Tatishev and Ablyazov business partner to repay outstanding BTA Bank loans. He and the Silk Road Group co-owned a Georgian bank creating a conflict of interest. The SilK Road Group was revealed to be a client of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specialized in offshore corporate structuring, accounting for purpose of sanction and tax evasion, and subject of the Panama Papers. The Silk Road Group entered an agreement with the Trump Organization to license the Trump brand for two luxury developments in Batumi and Tbilisi, Georgia. The deal was cancelled when Trump became president to avoid a conflict of interest. The Silk Road Group received loans from BTA Bank while Ablyazov was bank chairman, and Trump Organization involvement with SRG may be subject of Robert Mueller investigation into collusion with the Russian government and the Trump campaign.\n\nThe man convicted of manslaughter for accidentally shooting banker Yerzhan Tatishev on a hunting trip in 2004 said in a 2017 television documentary that he was in fact hired by Ablyazov to kill Tatishev. Tatishev was Ablyazov's BTA Bank partner and shareholder. The Kazakh Prosecutor General indicted Ablyazov on 17 August 2018 for the murder of former BTA Bank Chairman Erzhan Tatishev.\n\nIn November 2001, Ablyazov and other colleagues, including fellow disenchanted proteges of Nazarbaev, co-founded the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DCK), an opposition political movement that challenged the Nazarbayev regime. The DCK included a combination of existing politicians and major businessmen and called for the decentralisation of political power, a strong legislature, and an independent judiciary to balance the power concentrated in the executive branch. This opposition initiative, according to RFE/RL, “quickly drew the wrath of the regime.”\n\nIn July 2002, as one of the main leaders of the DCK, Ablyazov was convicted of “abusing official powers as a minister” and sentenced to six years in prison. Also sent to prison were his fellow would-be reformers and former Nazarbaev proteges Galymzhan Zhakiyanov and Altynbek Sarsenbaev.\n\nIn response to pressure from the international community, including Amnesty International and the European Parliament, he was released in May 2003 after only serving ten months, on the condition that he renounce politics.\n\nAblyazov moved to Moscow in 2003 to rebuild his business ties and in 2005 became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of BTA Bank.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Ablyazov reportedly spent “millions of dollars funding opposition groups and independent media.” RFE/RL has quoted Yevgeny Zhovtis, head of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law, as saying that “Nazarbaev to a certain extent felt betrayed” by Ablyazov and the others, given that “he thinks that he provided them the space to become wealthy, to become well-known, to make a career in state service or in business, and they challenged him. When he pardoned Ablyazov in 2003 and allowed him to return to business in exchange for a promise not to be involved in politics and then found out that he was again involved in politics, of course Nazarbaev felt betrayed twice.”\n\nWhile living in Russia and Kazakhstan, Ablyazov was the target of assassination attempts and an effort was made to kidnap his son from school.\n\nShortly thereafter, Kazakhstan's sovereign wealth fund, Samruk-Kazyna, injected significant funds into BTA in an effort to keep the bank solvent, effectively becoming its majority shareholder.\n\nIt has been argued that BTA Bank “threatened to dominate the other Kazakh banks – banks that Nazarbayev controlled” and that the bank's forced nationalization in 2009 was part of an effort by Nazarbayev “to dispose of Ablyazov.”\n\nFollowing the issuing of the Kazakh warrant, Ablyazov left Kazakhstan for London. This made him, according to RFE/RL, one of “dozens of former high-ranking Kazakh officials who have fled abroad after falling out of favor.”\n\nDuring his time in London, Ablyazov told \"The Standard\" that he was an “innocent...victim of persecution” by Nazarbaev and was “in fear of his life from his country's secret police, the KNB.”\nClaiming to be innocent of all charges, he “employed tight security to protect him from murder attempts” while living in London. Once, while he was being driven in London, a car “rammed his vehicle repeatedly.”\n\nWhile in Britain, Ablyazov maintained close ties to opposition media in Kazakhstan. RFE/RL has noted that in 2011, the broadcaster K+ and the newspapers Vzglyad and Golos Respubliki, along with other private Kazakh media with ties to Ablyazov, “gave full-scale coverage to the bloody police crackdown on striking oil workers in the western city of Zhanaozen.” Not long after, Kazakh courts ordered these media outlets closed, along with the opposition Algha party, headed by Avladimir Kozlov, an Ablyazov ally, who was sentenced to a long prison term. The Nazarbaev regime reportedly considered Ablyazov to be implicated in these media outlets' critical coverage of the regime.\n\nAlso during his time in Britain, Ablyazov was the main source of funding for Aksara, an independent theater company whose productions challenge the Nazarbaev regime and seek to provide an alternative to the state-subsidized theater, which toes the government line.\n\nIn 2012, a British judge ordered Ablyazov imprisoned for purportedly lying in court about his financial assets. Shortly thereafter, Ablyazov left Britain. It was charged that he exited the country in order to avoid imprisonment. His lawyers, however, said that he left because he had received a death threat. The lawyers further maintained that Ablyazov “did not embezzle the $6 billion claimed by the Kazakh government, but restructured the bank's holdings in order to protect them from precisely the kind of government takeover that took place in 2009.”\n\nSince his departure from Britain, it has been unclear where Ablyazov is living, although he was widely believed to have gone to France.\n\nAccording to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), the explanation for this action was that Nazarbaev was taking them as “political hostages.” Ablyazov’s oldest daughter, Madina, told RFE/RL that Nazarbaev wants to get his hands on Ablyazov. “Not as a hostage. Probably, the minute they have him, they will just kill him. They want to kill him, because my father is the biggest opponent for the president.” Ablyazov's lawyer, Riccardo Olivo, rejected the claim that Ablyazov's wife and child had false papers, saying that both of them had “valid Kazakh passports and EU residency permits issued by Latvia.”\n\nOlivio also charged that their rapid deportation from Italy “raised suspicions that Italian and Kazakh authorities had colluded on the deal.” A lawyer close to the Ablyazov family said: “A person could get arrested committing a violent crime in broad daylight and get better due process than they did.” Italy's Justice Ministry claims to have been unaware of the arrests and deportation until after the fact; Emma Bonino, the Italian Foreign Minister, has called the operation “abnormal.” Ablyazov, for his part, accused Nazarbaev of “kidnapping” his wife and child and of employing “outright terrorist tactics.”\n\nThe Italian media blamed the Interior Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, Angelino Alfano simultaneously, for the illegal deportation. He is also a member of the centre-right party ‘The People of Freedom’ headed by Silvio Berlusconi, known for his friendly relations with the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev.\n\nThe president of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano, expressed his stark criticism of the deportation of Alma Shalabayeva. He noted that the decision to deport her was made without necessary verification or thorough examination of the situation by the Italian bodies: “For any country, it is unacceptable to give in to the pressure and interference of foreign diplomacy, which resulted in the hasty expulsion of a mother and child from Italy on the basis of distorted information. I also believe that we need to fully guarantee fundamental rights of persons, regardless of the status which they have in our country”.\n\nOn 24 December 2013, a representative of the Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a change in the restriction of liberty measure for Alma Shalabayeva and the withdrawal of her prohibition from leaving Almaty. Shalabayeva and her daughter, Alua received their passports and left Kazakhstan.\n\nOn 18 April 2014, the Italian authorities granted Ablyazov’s wife and daughter refugee status. Alma and Alua received a 5-year renewable permit of stay. The decision on the award of refugee status was made by the Territorial Commission in Rome for Recognition of International Protection, under Article 1 of the Geneva Convention.\n\nFrom July 2013 to December 2016, Ablyazov was detained by French authorities, as Russia sought Ablyazov's extradition from France, but Ablyazov argued that extradition would place him at risk of ill-treatment and an unfair trial. Human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as many members of the European Parliament, wrote in opposition to extradition of Ablyazov. In 2015, a French court in Lyon issued an extradition order. However, in December 2016, France's highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, canceled the extradition order, on the ground that Russia had a political motive in making the extradition request. Ablyazov was released from the Fleury-Merogis prison.\n\nDuring his time in London, Ablyazov was described as not fitting “the Western stereotype of the fabulously wealthy businessman from the old Soviet Union. No bling, no yachts, no trophy wife and no ostentatious cars, he cuts a modest figure, favouring Marks and Spencer suits.”\nHowever, a High Court judge held Ablyazov in contempt and imposed three prison sentences for failing to disclose assets including a nine bedroom mansion in London's \"Billionaire's Row\" and a 100-acre estate in Windsor Great Park. He rented a 15,000 square foot mansion on Bishop's Avenue in London.\n"}

The Conservatory was designed by Lord & Burnham, for a fee of $100,000. The glasshouse, then consisting of nine display rooms, was completed in August 1893, one year after construction began. On December 7, 1893, the Phipps Conservatory was opened to the public, displaying many plants from the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\nSometime after 1910, the first of the Aquatic Gardens was built. A second pool would be installed in 1939.\n\nIn 1970, the Conservatory was declared a Historic Landmark by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation. In 1976, the Phipps Conservatory was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1993, the Phipps Conservatory, which had been run by the City of Pittsburgh since 1893, became a privately managed, while city owned, non-profit organization.\n\nIn October 2003, Phipps announced an expansion project. The first phase, a green engineered Welcome Center topped by a neo-Victorian dome, was designed by IKM Incorporated, and completed in 2005. The Production Greenhouses and a Tropical Forest Conservatory were completed in 2006.\n\nThe Tropical Forest conservatory has a different theme every three years, beginning with the country of Thailand. In addition to a \"Research Forest Station\" and a \"Healer's Hut\" (designed to educate visitors about various cultural topics), there are two waterfalls, several bridges, a stream, and a wide variety of plants from bamboo, orchids and frangipani to plants of economic, cultural, and horticultural value to the people of Thailand. The second theme is \"Headwaters of the Amazon,\" which opened in early 2009. \nIn 2007, Phipps teamed with glass artist Dale Chihuly and his Tacoma-based team of glass blowers. They worked together to create a marriage of hand-blown glass and living plants. Following the closing of the exhibit in February, the conservatory retained four prominent pieces (the Welcome Center chandelier, the hanging gold star in the Desert Room, the celadon and purple gilded Fiori in the Tropical Fruit and Spice Room and the bronze, apricot and chartreuse Ikebana in the Palm Court) and subsequently purchased 26 smaller pieces for its permanent collection including six multicolored Macchia (wavy, shell-like bowls), thirteen amber Cattails and seven Paintbrushes, all of which are installed in the Palm Court. The total Chihuly collection is valued at $1.2 million.\n\nIn 2009, Phipps teamed with another glass artist Hans Godo Frabel to create another stunning exhibit titled \"Gardens and Glass.\" Unlike the Chihuly pieces, Frabel's work is more realistic, although still whimsical at times. Highlights of this exhibit include Longfellows, intricate glass orchid and lotus plants and various clowns (balancing on either glass playing cards or colored glass balls.) This collaboration was on display until January 2010.\n\nThe Palm Court is the first room visitors see after entering the Conservatory through the main entrance. The Victorian-inspired room contains many species of palm trees. The room contains the original dated plaque from the Conservatory's opening as well as numerous glass installations by Dale Chihuly. To accommodate the palm trees, the Palm Court has a high glass peak.\n\nThe original wood and annealed glass in the Palm Court had deteriorated to a point for the need of emergency stabilization in 2008. Renovations began in 1992 and included replacing the upper wood and glass vent sash with aluminum and safety glass, and replacing the vertical wood and glass components with new replicated aluminum extrusions and safety glass glazing to match the original specifications exactly.\n\nThe Serpentine Room is located west of the Palm Court, connecting it to the Fern Room. The exhibits in the room change with the season for different shows and special exhibits. The room is named for its curved brick-walled pathway. Plants are lined along either side of the pathway, as well as suspended from the peaked ceiling.\n\nThe room was originally known as the Border Garden, which was redesigned as the present-day Serpentine Room during an 18-month period of extensive renovations starting in 1978.\n\nThe Fern Room is located in the west wing at the intersection of the Serpentine Room, the Orchid Room, and the Stove Room. The room contains many ferns, as well as cycads and other ground plants on which ferns commonly grow. The dominant species in the room are representative of the Triassic, during which ferns and cycads were common as flowering plants would not evolve until millennia later. Some species include Munch's cycad, Eastern Cape cycad, Zululand cycad, Queen sago, Staghorn fern, Australian tree fern, Tasmanian tree fern, tongue fern, bear's paw fern, and rabbit foot's fern.\n\nThe Orchid Room is located in the north part of the west wing. The room contains many orchids. This includes the miniature orchids and the Barbara Tisherman Slipper Orchid Collection, curated in collaboration with the Orchid Society of Western Pennsylvania. Also on display is the unique Phalaenopsis Frank Sarris orchid, named for the founder of Sarris Candies, a trustee and benefactor of the Conservatory.\n\nThe room originated with a donation of 800 rare orchids in 1931 from Charles D. Armstrong, owner of the Armstrong Cork Company. The orchids were then valued at $50,000.\n\nThe Stove Room is located in the south part of the west wing. From spring to fall, the room contains many butterflies and the exhibit is known as the Butterfly Forest. The plants in the room are representative of the deep tropics, and the room is maintained at a temperature of during the day and during the night.\n\nThe South Conservatory is located south of the Palm Court. The room houses seasonal flower shows. Since 1999, during fall and winter months, the room transforms into the Garden Railroad exhibit, in which miniature trains wind among a variety of small plants.\n\nOriginally called the Economic Room, the South Conservatory was built between 1896 and 1897 as a gift from Henry Phipps. It was then remodelled in the 1930s, during which time the room was partitioned to separate the Gallery and Tropical Fruit and Spice rooms.\n\nThe Tropical Fruit and Spice Room is located west of the South Conservatory. The room contains tropical and sub-tropical fruits, nuts, and spices such as citrus fruits, bananas, allspice, papayas, cinnamon and coffee. The marble basin in the center of the room features a Dale Chihuly glass sculpture in purple and celadon.\n\nThe Tropical Forest Conservatory, located south of the South Conservatory, is the largest indoor display area of the conservatory.\n\nThe Tropical Forest Conservatory opened on December 6, 2006. The Tropical Forest Conservatory has several interesting features, which make it extremely energy-efficient. It has \"earth tubes\" running underground to help cool the tropical forest and a solid oxide fuel cell, which efficiently produces 5 kW of electricity from natural gas. In addition, there are computer-controlled shades that block excess sunlight from entering the structure and also help to insulate it at night. The roof is also computer-controlled and many of the glass panes can be opened.\n\nThe Gallery Room is located east of the South Conservatory. The room contains didactic displays for children, such as the imaginary farmer's market, where children can play and learn about healthy food.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the room was known as the Modern Room, and featured contemporary room and garden scenes.\n\nThe Sunken Garden is located east of the Palm Court, connecting it to the Victoria Room. The room is furnished with fountains, hanging baskets, and sunken beds. The plants in the room vary with season. The room has changed several times over the decades. It has been known, at different times, the Cascade Garden featuring a modern cascading waterfall; the Charleston Garden featuring an antebellum-themed display with a Southern mansion façade; and, more recently, a Japanese-style garden.\n\nThe Desert Room is located south of the Sunken Garden. The room contains plant life that thrive in a desert climate, such as cacti and other succulent plants. A glass chandelier named Desert Gold Star by Dale Chihuly can also be found in the room. Some species include the Joshua tree, saguaro, palo verde, fire barrels, cape aloe, tortoise shell plant, bushman poison bulb, African tree grape, sunrise tequila agave, and shaving brush tree.\n\nThe Desert Room opened in 1902 as the Cacti House. When it first opened, guests could only look at the display garden over a terrace. In the late 1930s, the room was redesigned so that visitors could walk through it.\n\nThe Victoria Room is located in the east wing, connecting the Broderie Room, the East Room, and the Sunken Garden. The room features a large central pond containing an interactive fountain.\n\nThe Broderie Room, also known as the \"\" which translates to \"flowerbed of embroidery\", is located in the south part of the east wing. The garden is modelled after the formal gardens of French chateaux during the reign of Louis XIV, and is a popular setting for wedding ceremonies and photo shoots. The room opened in 1939 and was originally called the Cloister Garden. In 1966, the room was redesigned as the present-day Broderie Room.\n\nThe East Room is located in the north part of the east wing. The room contains streams and waterfalls. The displays change with season.\n\nThe Rooftop Edible Garden is located between the Desert Room and the Tropical Forest Conservatory. It contains several edible vegetables and fruits. The outdoor demonstration space produces fresh produce for the cafeteria in the Welcome Center and serves as a site of hands-on learning for children's camps and youth programs.\n\nThe Japanese Courtyard Garden is located between the Desert Room and the Gallery Room. It contains a Japanese garden and several bonsai. The Garden was installed in 1991 and was designed by Hoichi Kurisu.\n\nThe Children's Discovery Garden is located between the Stove Room and the Tropical Spices room. The Garden contains areas designed to attract birds, butterflies, and bees. It also includes a bog garden, a sensory garden, and various outdoor spaces to entertain and educate children.\n\nThe Outdoor Garden is located to the northwest of the main building complex. The garden contains many smaller gardens and plant collections, including an herb garden, a medicinal garden, perennials, ferns and dwarf conifers.\n\nThe original hardscape was constructed by Works Progress Administration in 1935 and persists to this day. The garden was originally known as the Perennial Garden, which was transformed into the Outdoor Garden in 1986.\n\nThe Botany Hall, across from Panther Hollow Bridge, features a small garden containing walkways, curved benches, and a fountain. The Botany Hall was funded, in 1901, by Henry Phipps to be used by local teachers looking to enhance class trips to the glasshouse. It was renovated in the late 1990s and continues to serve as a site for many educational programs and events.\n\nThe Aquatic garden is located on the east side of the Conservatory outside of the Victoria Room. During the summer, the two pools are filled with tropical water plants and floating flora. One of the pools features a statue of Neptune, the Roman god of the sea, which was presented to Phipps shortly after our glasshouse opened in 1893. The northern pool was constructed sometime between 1910 and 1915, and the southern one was added in 1939.\nThe Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL) is a building on the Conservatory grounds, located south of the Tropical Forest Conservatory, that is designed to be environmentally sustainable. Opened in December 2012, the building produces all of its own energy and treats and reuses all water captured on site. The exhibits in the building include informational signs, an interactive kiosk, and art exhibits. The building also contains a classroom for children.\n\nThe CSL has received a Platinum LEED certification along with fulfilling the Living Building Challenge for net-zero energy, Additionally, the CSL is the first and only building to receive Four Stars Sustainable SITES Initiative certification for landscaping projects. These honors and certifications make the CSL one of the 'greenest' buildings in the world.\n\n\nVideo\n"}

It also represents its members internationally, and to Government, regional bodies and local authorities in the UK.\n\nA number of universities active in wind energy in the 1970s met under umbrella of the ITDG Wind Panel (Intermediate Technology Development Group). The BWEA was formed from the ITDG Wind Panel along with other interested parties and representatives from industry, to promote wind power in the United Kingdom. The inaugural meeting of the BWEA took place on 17 November 1978 at the Rutherford Laboratory with Peter Musgrove of Reading University as chairman.\n\nIn 2004 the British Wind Energy Association expanded its remit to include wave and tidal energy, and to use the Association's experience to guide these technologies along the same path to commercialisation. In December 2009, to reflect this expansion in the industries it represented, members resolved to adopt the new name of RenewableUK.\n\nIn 2008 the then BWEA was found by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to have overstated the carbon dioxide emissions displaced by wind generation. The BWEA and its members had claimed a value of 860 grams per kilowatt hour but the ASA found this was exaggerated by 100% and ordered the BWEA to reduce the figure to 430 grams.\n\nThe members of RenewableUK are represented in Wales by RenewableUK Cymru, the Cardiff-based branch of the organisation.

{"id": "626115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=626115", "title": "Resource Conservation and Recovery Act", "text": "Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\n\nThe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), enacted in 1976, is the principal federal law in the United States governing the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste.\n\nCongress enacted RCRA to address the increasing problems the nation faced from its growing volume of municipal and industrial waste. RCRA amended the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965. It set national goals for:\nIt is now most widely known for the regulations promulgated under RCRA that set standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published waste management regulations, which are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations at parts 239 through 282. Regulations regarding management of hazardous waste begin in part 260. As noted below, most states have enacted laws and created regulations that are at least as stringent as the federal regulations. Furthermore, the RCRA statute authorizes states to carry out many of the functions of the federal law through their own hazardous waste programs (as well as their state laws) if such programs have been approved by the EPA.\n\n\n\nArguably the most notable provisions of the RCRA statute are included in Subtitle C, which directs EPA to establish controls on the management of hazardous wastes from their point of generation, through their transportation and treatment, storage and/or disposal. Because RCRA requires controls on hazardous waste generators (i.e., sites that generate hazardous waste), transporters, and treatment, storage and disposal facilities (i.e., facilities that ultimately treat/dispose of or recycle the hazardous waste), the overall regulatory framework has become known as the \"cradle to grave\" system. The program imposes stringent recordkeeping and reporting requirements on generators, transporters, and operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities handling hazardous waste.\n\nNon-hazardous solid wastes include certain hazardous wastes which are exempted from the Subtitle C regulations, such as hazardous wastes from households and from conditionally exempt small quantity generators. Oil and gas exploration and production wastes, such as drill cuttings, produced water, and drilling fluids are categorized as \"special wastes\" and are also exempt from Subtitle C. Subtitle D also includes garbage (e.g., food containers, coffee grounds), non-recycled household appliances, residue from incinerated automobile tires, refuse such as metal scrap, construction materials, and sludge from industrial and municipal waste water facilities and drinking water treatment plants.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe operation of underground storage tanks (USTs) became subject to the RCRA regulatory program with enactment of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA). At that time there were about 2.1 million tanks subject to federal regulation, and the EPA program led to closure and removal of most substandard tanks. As of 2009 there were approximately 600,000 active USTs at 223,000 sites subject to federal regulation.\n\nThe federal UST regulations cover tanks storing petroleum or listed hazardous substances, and define the types of tanks permitted. EPA established a tank notification system to track UST status. UST regulatory programs are principally administered by state and U.S. territorial agencies.\n\nThe regulations set standards for:\n\nThe Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) required owners and operators of USTs to ensure corrective action is completed when a tank is in need of repair, or removal, when it is necessary to protect human health and the environment. It is also recommended that above-ground storage tanks are used whenever possible.\n\nRCRA Subtitle J regulated medical waste in four states (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island) and Puerto Rico, and expired on March 22, 1991. (\"See\" Medical Waste Tracking Act.) If determined to be hazardous, medical waste is currently regulated by RCRA Subtitle C for hazardous wastes.\n\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as \"Superfund,\" was enacted in 1980 to address the problem of remediating abandoned hazardous waste sites, by establishing legal liability, as well as a trust fund for cleanup activities. In general CERCLA applies to contaminated sites, while RCRA's focus is on controlling the ongoing generation and management of particular waste streams. RCRA, like CERCLA, has provisions to require cleanup of contaminated sites that occurred in the past.\n\nIn 1984 Congress expanded the scope of RCRA with the enactment of Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA). The amendments strengthened the law by covering small quantity generators of hazardous waste and establishing requirements for hazardous waste incinerators, and the closing of substandard landfills.\n\nIn 1986, SARA addressed cleanup of leaking USTs and other leaking waste storage facilities. The amendments established a trust fund to pay for the cleanup of leaking UST sites where responsible parties cannot be identified. \n\nThe Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996 allowed some flexibility in the procedures for land disposal of certain wastes. For example, a waste is not subject to land disposal restrictions if it is sent to an industrial wastewater treatment facility, a municipal sewage treatment plant, or is treated in a \"zero discharge\" facility.\n\nThe bill Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of 2013 (H.R. 2279; 113th Congress), which made it to the House floor in January 2014, would amend this law \"to remove a requirement that the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review and revise regulations declared under such Act at least every three years.\"\n\nTreatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) manage hazardous waste under RCRA Subtitle C and generally must have a permit in order to operate. While most facilities have RCRA permits, some continue to operate under what is called \"interim status.\" Interim status requirements appear in 40 CFR Part 265.\n\nThe permitting requirements for TSDFs appear in 40 CFR Parts 264 and 270. TSDFs manage (treat, store, or dispose) hazardous waste in units that may include: container storage areas, tanks, surface impoundments, waste piles, land treatment units, landfills, incinerators, containment buildings, and/or drip pads. The unit-specific permitting and operational requirements are described in further detail in 40 CFR Part 264, Subparts J through DD.\n\n\n"}

The Committee issued 54 SAPs before it became the Auditing Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) and began issuing Statements on Auditing Standards.Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1 summarized and superseded the 54 SAPs.\n\nThe history of the Statements on Auditing Procedures began in 1917 when the American Institute of Accountants (the predecessor organization for the AICPA) was asked by the Federal Trade Commission to prepare a \"memorandum on balance-sheet audits.\" The resulting document was published in the April 1917 issue of the Federal Reserve Bulletin and reissued in 1918 as a pamphlet. In 1929 the pamphlet was again revised. A third revision was done in 1936. \n\nThe Institute determined that, rather than reissuing the 1936 pamphlet, it would, through the Committee on Auditing Procedure, issue Statements on Auditing Procedure that modified and superseded parts of the 1936 pamphlet. The SAPs were \"designed to guide the auditor in those areas of specific situations encountered in practice in which he must exercise judgment, situations outside the realm of textbooks, whose function is inherently to describe procedures in general.\" By 1948, the 1936 pamphlet was considered so out-of-date that it was withdrawn from publication. \n\nIn 1951, the first 24 \"Statements on Auditing Procedure\" were codified The \"Codification\" also contains a summary history of the process of standardizing auditing practice up to 1951 (see pp. 5–8). \n\nIn 1954, the Committee on Auditing Procedure finished work on the booklet \"Generally Accepted Auditing Standards: Their Significance and Scope.\" This publication responded to the Securities and Exchange Commission's recommendation that the auditor's report make a representation as to compliance with generally accepted auditing standards.\n\nStatement on Procedure no. 33 again codified previous Committee on Auditing Procedure publications, including the 1951 \"Codification\", The 1954 \"Generally Accepted Auditing Standards,\" and \"Statements on Auditing Procedure\" 25-32.\n\nThe final publication of the Committee on Auditing procedure, \"Codification of Auditing Standards and Procedures 1,\" superseded SAPs 33-54.
