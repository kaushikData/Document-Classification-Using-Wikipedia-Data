He was also an important figure in the revival of Theravada Buddhism in the country when it was being suppressed by the state.\n\nBhaju Ratna was born in Kathmandu, the third of four sons of father Kulbir Singh and mother Nanibeti Kansakar. His ancestral home was located at Kel Tol, a business and ceremonial neighborhood in central Kathmandu. Its most important landmark is the temple of Jana Baha Dyah, which is known in Sanskrit as Aryavalokitesvara (Sacred Avalokiteśvara). Bhaju Ratna never went to school, and taught himself to read and write. \n\nThe Kansakars were engaged in the hereditary occupation of making bronze, brass and copper household utensils. Bhaju Ratna started out as a worker at a relative's workshop in Darjeeling, India in 1898. Returning to Kathmandu in 1903, Bhaju Ratna got married to Gyan Maya Tamrakar. He went back to his job in Darjeeling shortly after.\n\nAfter a few years in Darjeeling, Bhaju Ratna decided to set up a cloth shop in Kathmandu with his savings, and went to Mumbai to procure stock. Around 1905, he opened a cloth shop at Kel Tol. The business prospered, but in 1918, a massive fire destroyed the entire stock of textiles and yarn, and Bhaju Ratna was ruined. About the same time, his wife died leaving behind four children. \n\nBhaju Ratna remarried and moved to Kalimpong, India in 1921 to start afresh as a seller of household utensils for export to Tibet. Kalimpong was then the start of the caravan route to Lhasa. As business grew, he brought over craftsmen from Kathmandu and established his own workshop.\n\nBhaju Ratna habitually wore a white cap, and Tibetan traders would often refer to him as Syamukapu, which means \"white cap\" in Tibetan. It would become the name of the business house he subsequently established in Kalimpong and Tibet.\n\nBhaju Ratna diversified into forwarding Lhasa-bound cargo for Lhasa Newar merchants based in the Tibetan capital. Later, he also procured the merchandise for them on commission basis, and dispatched them to Lhasa by mule caravan. By 1930, he had opened his own establishment in Tibet at Phari, which lies on the trade route to Lhasa. \n\nSince most of the merchandise shipped to Lhasa were obtained in Kolkata, he set up an office there too in 1937, and sent his eldest son Maniharsha Jyoti Kansakar to work there. In 1939, he set up a business house in Lhasa.\n\nBhaju Ratna's extensive trading enterprises grew into the Jyoti Group which was founded in the 1940s by Maniharsha Jyoti (1917-1992). It is involved in trading, manufacturing, travel, steel, pharmaceuticals and insurance. Bhaju Ratna's grandson Padma Jyoti is the chairman of the Jyoti Group.\n\nBhaju Ratna became one of the most important supporters of the movement to revive Theravada Buddhism at a time when it faced official disapproval at great personal risk. In 1926, following the banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal by the Rana regime, he took care of them when they arrived in Kalimpong. During the second expulsion in 1944 too, he housed and fed the monks for years. Bhaju Ratna's generosity earned him the name \"hero of charity\". He has also been featured in the course of study in Buddhism as an eminent lay person.\n\nBhaju Ratna died at his home in Kathmandu aged 74.\n\n"}

After several years of financial difficulties, the company ceased operation in 1999 and its assets were sold.\n\nIts flagship store, corporate office and warehouse complex occupied two blocks in downtown Detroit for almost 80 years. The store was a direct competitor of the J. L. Hudson Company and the Ernst Kern Company until Kern's closed in 1959. Crowley's and Hudson's were both noted for their lavish annual Christmas displays. Faced with a decline in retail traffic in downtown Detroit, Crowley's closed its downtown location in July 1977. The firm operated a store in Detroit's New Center area that remained open until the chain's demise in 1999.\n\nOn March 11, 1995, the chain acquired Steinbach in the northeast US. When Crowley's ceased operation in 1999, several of its locations were purchased by discount chain Value City. Three in the Detroit area were rebranded \"Crowley's Value City\" and remained part of the Value City chain until it also ceased operating in 2008.\n\nIn 1909, Joseph J. Crowley, his brothers William and Daniel, and William L. Milner joined to save the Detroit-based store of Pardridge & Blackwell that was struggling financially. Joseph Crowley previously worked as a credit manager for the Detroit wholesale firm of Burnham Stoepel and had great experience reorganizing struggling ventures. He and his brothers opened the Crowley Brothers Wholesale Dry Goods Company in 1902. William Milner was a regular customer of the Crowley Brothers through his W.L. Milner Department Store of Toledo, Ohio.\n\nPardridge & Blackwell formed in 1901 and was on the edge of insolvency due to poor management and the recession of 1907. The opportunity to assume control of the retailer came when an executive of the Central Savings Bank of Detroit, one of the store's creditors, approached Joseph Crowley. Crowley agreed on the condition that his two brothers and Milner join him and Crowley, Milner and Company was born.\n\nImmediately after the incorporation of Crowley, Milner and Co., its owners envisioned the store as one of the highest quality retail operations in Detroit. At the turn of the twentieth century, Detroit was regarded as one of the most affluent cities in the United States, and Crowley, Milner & Co. helped to uphold this image. The owners stocked the store with luxurious clothing and gifts imported from Europe and opened a full-service restaurant and grocery store. Within ten years, the Crowley, Milner & Co. expanded its building and was the largest department store in Michigan. \n\nThe Pardridge & Blackwell Building occupied the western half of the block bounded by Farmer Street, Gratiot Avenue, Library and Monroe Streets. It contained six floors with large triple windows on the second through fourth floors divided by piers faced with white glazed brick and terra cotta. The piers formed arches above the windows of the fifth floor with windows on the sixth floor spaced between the corbels supporting the elaborate cornice above. Two large illuminated signs proclaiming \"\"P.& B.\" inside a heart graced the northwest and southwest corners of the roof. Crowley, Milner expanded the building by removing the cornice to add a seventh and eighth floor and expanding east to Library Street. In 1920, they then constructed an eleven-story \"home store\" on the site of the Goldberg Brothers store east of Library Street. Initially, the annex was connected to the main building by a tunnel. In 1923, the city of Detroit granted permission to connect the two structures above ground and an elaborate five-story bridge opened in 1925. The entrances on Farmer, Gratiot and Monroe were framed by large arches and the windows above the doors on the second floor were topped by a large pediment. One notable feature of the department store was wooden escalators which remained until the structure was demolished in 1977.\n\nThe company stumbled slightly when Milner was killed in 1923 while traveling to his store in Toledo. The company lost its president and merchandising expert and his 42 percent interest in the corporation was sold by his heirs. Without Milner, the store eventually came to be known as Crowley's, but the company retained its full name until 1999. Joseph Crowley succeeded his friend and partner as president, but the loss of full control by the tight-knit group affected the company for many years.\n\nLike many retailers, the Great Depression impacted Crowley's deeply. Sales plummeted from $39 million in 1928 to only $10 million in 1929. Joseph Crowley died in 1937 and his widow repurchased the shares of the company sold by William Milner's heirs to give the Crowleys majority ownership in the corporation. Daniel J. Crowley, Joseph's son, became president and helped the company chart a course to recovery.\n\nThe company began its transformation from a single store to a chain in 1959 when Crowley's expanded to the Detroit suburbs by opening its first store in the Westborn Shopping Center in Dearborn. This was followed by a store in the Grand River/Greenfield shopping area in northwest Detroit in 1960 and identical stores in the Livonia and Macomb Malls in 1964. However, this expansion was at the expense of the downtown store. By 1960, the store consolidated enough to allow the Veteran's Administration to lease the lower six-floors of the annex building for $147,000 per year.\n\nIn 1972, the firm purchased the Demery's chain which consisted of a store at Woodward and Milwaukee in the New Center neighborhood, and in the suburbs of Birmingham and Farmington Hills. The New Center store later moved into the New Center One Building.\n\nThe Lakeside Mall store in Sterling Heights opened in 1975 followed in 1980 by stores at Universal Mall in Warren and Arborland Center in Ann Arbor. The Tel-Twelve Mall unit opened in 1985. In 1986, stores opened in Westland and at Courtland Center in Burton, the latter approximately one hour north of Detroit.\n\nThe downtown store closed in 1977 due to declining sales. This was followed by closure of the office and warehouse building in 1978 and the Ann Arbor store in 1983 when the Arborland Center was converted to a discount center. Offices moved to a building on Lafayette Boulevard at the western edge of the downtown business district and remained there until the company's liquidation. The Grand River-Greenfield store was only , but continuously performed well in sales. It was located in several storefronts along Grand River Avenue and in 1987 the landlord wanted to redivide the building to lure new businesses. It offered Crowley's a portion of the renovated structure but the store declined.\n\nIn 1985, members of the Crowley family, who still owned more than 51 percent of the company stock agreed to sell the store to Oakland Holding Company.\n\nIn 1990, Crowley's opened a new prototype men's store adjacent to its Farmington store which immediately was successful. The store-within-a-store concept focused on men's businesswear and was immediately expanded to other branches.\n\nThis was an attempt to lure customers back from newcomers to the Detroit market such as MainStreet, a unit of Federated Department Stores which later became Kohl's, and Mervyns. Crowley's changed its product line to feature more upmarket with lines by Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren aimed at the Hudson's or Lord & Taylor shopper. This move alienated many traditional customers as Crowley's was seen as a more mid-market store with locations in Detroit's older suburbs.\n\nThe prototype men's clothing store proved to be a successful move. Sales were strong, and the company discussed plans to introduce more similar stores in the future. This store within a store had its own entrance and focused on men's suits and accessories; similar to the Men's Wearhouse. The young men's and sportswear was in the located in the main store. Also, Crowley's instituted a \"Frequent Buyer\" program at all of its stores, as a method of encouraging customer loyalty. The program kept track of each customer's monthly purchase amounts, and then the stores issued gift certificates based on each person's sales figures.\n\nDespite the initial success of the Frequent Buyers program and the new store format, annual sales dropped almost $10 million from 1991 to 1992.\n\nIn March 1991, Crowley, Milner & Co. announced it was seeking a merger partner that was large enough to help the company expand. It was management's opinion that long-term growth for the Crowley's chain would come through acquisition of some type, with the most likely scenario being an acquisition by another party.\n\nIn late 1992, the company opened a store carrying only women's clothing in Lansing, based on the concept of its men's store in Farmington. The store was unsuccessful and analysts were split on the reasons. Some felt it was due to the location or layout while others cited the unfamiliarity of the Crowley's brand in the Lansing market.\n\nIn 1993, the company obtained a revolving line of credit from Schottenstein Stores, which provided Crowley, Milner & Co. with the ability to resume payments to its creditors. It then implemented other changes which included a new computer software system to manage personnel, closing the Westland store and eliminating the Frequent Buyers program.\n\nThe result was that sales increased in 1994 and the company announced its first profitable quarter in almost five years. Management continued to rebuild financial stability by obtaining a new working capital loan from Congress Financial Corporation to replace the agreement with Schottenstein Stores Corp. Management also announced a two-for-one common stock split, introduced its own credit card and the new slogan \"Detroit's Own Department Store\".\n\nSales in 1995 rose to $109.9 million. On November 21 of that year, Crowley's purchased the Steinbach chain with 24 stores in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Vermont from the Schottenstein family. The company planned to sell approximately 10 of the stores and continue operation of the others. It ultimately retained 16 stores.\n\nIn 1996, Crowley's proposed a new store for Novi's Main Street development but this fell through by 1999, as did a 1998 takeover of local women's fashion chain Winkelman's. It did expand into the Winkelman's store at Tel-Twelve Mall and opened a separate Men's store in that mall.\n\nOn June 1, 1997, Crowley's opened its enlarged store in the atrium of the New Center One Building. The expansion was in space previously occupied by Winkelman's and a bookstore which became children's and home stores separate from men's and women's clothing. This was not their largest location, but was the most profitable store by square footage. At the same time it hearlded the success of the New Center store, Crowley's announced a costly lesson from its purchase of Steinbach in the form of a $4 million loss during the first quarter of 1997. This was up from $1.3 million for the first quarter of 1996.\n\nThe losses proved too great and in 1997, the company began to downsize in the hope of remaining viable. Crowley's lost the lease on the Birmingham store it acquired as part of the Demrey's merger when the landlord announced it would redevelop the site into a retail-entertainment complex.[15]\n\nLosses which were $5.2 million for the first half of 1998 could not be offset with renovation delays in reopening its largest location, the Macomb Mall store in time for critical back to school sales. On January 4, 1999, Shottenstein Stores and Value City took control of Crowley's in a stock swap transaction. Two weeks later, trading of the company's stock was suspended.[16] On February 8, 1999, Crowley's filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws and announced it would liquidate the remaining nine Crowley's and 16 Steinbach's stores and sell eight additional locations to Value City.[9][17]\n\nThe Livonia Mall, Universal Mall, Macomb Mall and Westborn Mall stores were sold to discounter Value City who operated the three as Crowley's Value City.[13] The Westborn Mall location was resold and demolished to construct a Kroger.[14] Another mall-based location at Lakeside Mall in Sterling Heights was sold to Target Corporation to create an expansion to the Hudson's store. Four Steinbach stores in New Jersey (Ocean Township, Paramus, Manalapan, Egg Harbor Township) were also sold to Value City.\n\n"}

In 2005, the company was sold to Novartis.\n\nIn 2003, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for being \"an inspiring example of how one can positively influence the lives of many\".\n\nBuckley was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1921 and adopted by William Buckley, who had founded Buckley's Company in 1920; one year prior to Francis' adoption. Buckley graduated from the University of Toronto in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in commerce and finance. Shortly after graduating from college Buckley enlisted in the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm as a carrier-based fighter pilot and served in World War II during his time with the Royal Navy Fleet. He started his career in the family business as a traveling door to door salesman for three years.\n\nAfter Buckley had served his family business as a salesman, he took a position in the Management department. Frank Buckley was more interested in broadcast media, finance, and administration type of business while William was first and foremost a salesman; this dynamic element between the father-son combo proved to be an extremely and immensely effective tandem. William K. Buckley died in 1978. Frank Buckley assumed his adoptive father's position in the family business as the president.\n\nIn the mid-1980s Buckley became the spokesman for Buckley's. He first came on the scene as the spokesman when the company implemented the satirically honest ad campaign that owned up to Buckley's \"awful taste\". This campaign was featured on many television and radio commercials. Because of Buckley's time and success as the company's spokesman on the many featured commercials, he became a recognizable public figure.\n\nSince Buckley was a small boy, he always sustained an interest in the pharmaceutical industry. Buckley served as the Proprietary Association of Canada's president—which as since been changed to the Non-Prescription Drug Manufacturers Association of Canada—and remained a member until his death. Buckley was always very active throughout his life and involved with many community service organizations. He died on February 1, 2016 in Toronto at the age of 94.\n\n"}

Big established enterprises like Cisco, Novell, Sun Microsystems etc., no longer manufacture all the hardware required in the market, instead they ‘license’ or ‘certify’ small hardware players operating out from countries like Taiwan or China.\n\nTo obtain certification, the hardware or software has to conform to a set of protocols and quality standards that are put in place by the original creator of technology. Usually the certification process is done by a “Certification partner”. Certification partners are selected by the original creators of the technology and these partners are given the authority to do the testing and certification process. After a product is found to be compatible, it is labelled as xxx certified where xxx is the name of the original creator of the technology. Vendors use a “label” on the products to advertise the fact of compatibility with the said technology.\n\nThe process of certification ensures that the products made by different manufacturers are standardized and are compatible with each other as indicated in hardware or software platform.\n\nThird-party certification is undertaken by an independent body.

He was educated at Shrewsbury School, St John's College, Cambridge, and the Institute of Education, University of London. In 1937 he became a language master at Bradford Grammar School, and later at Beckenham and Penge County School for Boys. In 1940 he married Hetty, daughter of Eardley Vine, of Beaconsfield. They had three children, Janet, Brian and the philosopher Jonathan.\n\nIn the Second World War Rée was registered in 1940 as a conscientious objector conditional upon working in the National Fire Service, but in 1941 re-registered for military service and was called up into the army. He later volunteered for the Special Operations Executive, receiving a captaincy in the Intelligence Corps and the codename \"César\". In April 1943 he was parachuted into France and joined the Acrobat Network around Montbéliard. Later he became active in the Stockbroker Network around Belfort.\n\nRée spoke against RAF bombing in France, arguing that it was turning French public opinion against the Allies. He suggested that SOE agents could organise effective sabotage of factories on the ground. He organised the destruction of the Peugeot factory at Sochaux by convincing the local director, who was already resisting, to co-operate with SOE. The local director's sabotage was more efficient, and he managed to share tactical information on the Wehrmacht projects they had had to become involved in (especially the [V-1]). On 5 November 1943 Rée organised a decoy attack on compressors and transformers at Sochaux to transfer the blame. Therefore, the RAF did not bomb the factory.\n\nThe Germans tried to capture Rée, who escaped a Feldgendarmerie group after being shot four times and, according to his own account, had to swim across a river and crawl through a forest. He managed to reach Switzerland and still keep some contact with his organisation. In May 1944 he was replaced by an American officer, E.F. Floege, and returned to Britain. He starred in the film \"Now it Can be Told\" (aka \"School for Danger\"), produced by the RAF Film Unit, which told the story of SOE's activities in France.\n\nIn 1951, Rée became headmaster of Watford Grammar School for Boys. He appeared occasionally on the BBC Television \"Brains Trust\" programme. In 1962 he became the first professor of education at the University of York.\n\nRée wrote a biography of the educator and inventor of Village Colleges, Henry Morris : \"Educator Extraordinary: The Life and Achievements of Henry Morris\" (Longman, 1973) and produced a compilation of Morris' talks and articles, \"The Henry Morris Collection\" (Cambridge University Press, 1984). He also wrote The Three Peaks of Yorkshire a walking guide. He died in 1991.\n\n\n"}

He wanted his son to continue his business but Jindřich found a position of a clerk at the firm of Eduard Lokesch and Son in Prague. This company made buttons and cufflinks. As Waldes had a good knowledge of languages he became Lokesch’s business agent and travelled the world on behalf of the firm.\nIn 1902 together with an engineer Hynek Puc (1856–1938) Waldes left Lokesch and founded his own company Waldes a spol. A year later Puc invented a special machine that inserted a small spring into concealed dress fasteners, the main product of the new firm. The new machine supplemented labour of ten skilled workers. With the increased production Puc kept inventing more machines to support the manufacture of pins, safety pins, needles and buttons. The world-renowned Waldes trademark, Miss KIN, came about in 1912 when Waldes on his ocean trip met Elizabeth Coyne who playfully put one fastener in her eye. František Kupka painted her portrait in oils and Vojtěch Preissig from it designed the firm’s trademark. The other trade names used were Koh-i-noor and Otello.\n\nWaldes Koh-i-noor headquarters were located in Prague suburbs of Vršovice. Soon the company grew to a large concern with branch factories in Warsaw, Dresden, Vienna, Paris, Barcelona and New York City.\n\nOn 1 September 1939 Waldes was imprisoned by Gestapo after the Third Reich occupation of Czechoslovakia and kept in concentration camps Dachau and Buchenwald, arriving in Dachau on September 10, 1939 and transferred to Buchenwald on September 26 of the same year. In 1941 his family, who were sent to USA by Waldes before the war (he decided to remain in Prague as a Czech patriot) paid the Nazi authorities 8 million Czech crowns (about 1 Million Reichsmarks or $250,000 US) ransom. In Buchenwald he suffered a diabetic attack, and was in the prison hospital from 11 April 1940 until his release on 2 June 1941. The Gestapo then transported Waldes by plane to Lisbon, Portugal, where he boarded a United States-bound ship. However, Waldes did not survive the journey to the USA and died under suspicious circumstances on the ship which stopped at Havana, Cuba in May 1941.\n\n\"He [Waldes] arrived on a Portuguese ship in Cuba. In the moment that he stepped onto solid ground, he broke down and died.\"\n\nAccording to witness testimony during a case in the US in the late 1950s, Waldes actually died in a hospital in Havana. He was cremated at a memorial attended by several hundred people on 15 July 1941 at Fresh Pond, Maspeth, in New York.\n\nWaldes was also a passionate art collector of contemporary Czech art. In 1918 in Prague he founded Waldes Museum for his collection of buttons which had over 70 thousand items. The collection was transferred after the Second World War to Museum of Decorative Arts (Uměleckoprůmyslové museum) in Prague. Apart from buttons he collected works of Czech painters especially František Kupka’s paintings. They became friends in 1919 and remained so until 1938. Waldes supported Kupka throughout his career by buying his canvases. Part of Jindřich Waldes’ collection held by the National Gallery in Prague had been returned to his descendants living in the United States.\n\nIn 2007 the Prague City Court rendered the decision to return fifty percent of the Czech Koh-i-Noor holdings to the Waldes family heirs. However, in 2010 the Constitutional Court in Brno reversed the decision, stating that the Beneš decrees of 1945 handed the property to the Czech state, not the Communist seizures in 1948.\n\n\n\n"}

A wealthy landowner, Page donated land and funds for the first brick Bruton Parish Church. Col. Page was a prime force behind the small community gaining the site of the new College of William & Mary, founded in 1693, as well as a chief proponent of the village being designated the colony's capital in 1698.\n\nThese events resulted in the renaming of Middle Plantation as Williamsburg in 1699, perhaps most well known as the birthplace of democratic governmental principals among the patriots before and during the American Revolution. In the early 21st century, Colonel Page's tiny Middle Plantation is the modern home of the restored colonial city now known as Colonial Williamsburg, one of the most popular tourism destinations in the world.\n\nAccording to the Genealogy of the Page Family in Virginia, published in 1883, \"John Page, son of Thomas Page (b. 1597), of Sudbury, County Middlesex, England, seventh son of Richard Page, second son of John Page (b. 1528), first of Henry Page (b. 1500), of Wembley, County Middlesex, England, all of the Parish of Harrow, was born at Sudbury in A.D. 1627. He immigrated to America about 1650 at about 23 years of age, and became the progenitor of the Page-family in Virginia.\" John Page's niece Mary Whaley (daughter of his brother Matthew and wife of James Whaley of Bruton Parish, York County, Virginia) is buried in the churchyard.\nJohn Page became a merchant, and emigrated to the Virginia colony; his sister Elizabeth (wife of Edward Digges) and brother Matthew also emigrated to Virginia. In about 1656, John Page married Alice Lukin, (1625–1698) perhaps the daughter of Edward Lukin, a Virginia Company shareholder. The Pages originally lived in the New Towne section at Jamestown.\n\nThe Pages settled in York County in 1655. In 1662, the Pages had a large brick cross-plan house built in nearby Middle Plantation. A wealthy landowner, Page owned 330 acres (1.3 km²) in Middle Plantation, including much of what is now Duke of Gloucester Street, Nicholson Street, and part of Francis Street in the restored area of Colonial Williamsburg. In 1672, Page patented 3600 acres (15 km²) in New Kent County which became Mehixton Plantation. He donated land and £20 for the first brick Bruton Parish Church which was completed in 1683, and was located immediately adjacent to the site of the present larger restored structure. In 1683, he came into possession of a tract of land which originally belonged to his brother Matthew in James City County known as Neck of Land. It is also known that he owned property at Jamestown in New Towne section. \n\nJohn Page was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses starting in 1665. He played a pivotal role in supporting the efforts of Reverend Doctor James Blair in the founding of the College of William & Mary in 1693, which was located at Middle Plantation. Beginning in 1677, he is believed to have been an early advocate for moving the capitol to Middle Plantation, which eventually occurred in 1699, seven years after his death. (Middle Plantation was renamed Williamsburg in honor of King William III shortly thereafter).\n\nColonel John Page and his wife Alice Lukin Page are buried at Bruton Parish Church in Williamsburg, Virginia. Their tombstone, originally located within the church graveyard, was later moved to the church vestibule. It reads: \"Here lieth in hope of a joyfull resurrection the Body of Colonel JOHN PAGE of Bruton Parish, Esquire. One of their Majesties Council in the Dominion of Virginia. Who departed this life the 23 of January in the year of our Lord 1691/2 Aged 65\" The tombstone carries the arms of Page impaling those of Lukin.\n\nThe Page family was one of the First Families of Virginia, which later included Mann Page III, his brother U.S. Congressman and Virginia Governor John Page, and later descendants such as U.S. Ambassador to Italy Thomas Nelson Page, and Virginian Railway builder William Nelson Page.\n\nColonel and Mrs. John Page named their eldest son Francis, and he also built a substantial brick home at Middle Plantation. (Present-day Francis Street in Williamsburg is said to be named for him). Another son, Matthew Page, was born in Virginia in 1659 and became a planter. He was one of the original board of trustees of the College of William and Mary, a member of the Governor's Council, and was active in public affairs. He died on January 9, 1703.\n\nTheir grandson, Mann Page I (1691–1730) (son of Matthew Page), also became a planter and wealthy landholder in Virginia, owning nearly 70,000 acres (280 km²) in Frederick County, Prince William County, and Spotsylvania County among other locations. In 1725, Mann Page I began the construction of Rosewell Plantation, the Page mansion on the banks of the York River in Gloucester County. Mann Page I's wife Judith Carter was the daughter of Robert Carter I. Mann Page I son John Page married Jane Byrd, a granddaughter of Colonel William Byrd I. One of John Page's great-grandsons was Confederate General Richard Lucian Page.\n\nMary Page, the daughter of Col. John Page, married Walter Chiles Jr., son of Col. Walter Chiles of the Virginia Governor's Council. In his will of March 5, 1687, Col. John Page mentions his grandson John Chiles, as well as his \"grandsonne John Tyler, sonne of my grand-daughter Elizabeth Tyler.\" Elizabeth Chiles had married Henry Tyler of Middle Plantation, and thus became the ancestress of President John Tyler.\n\nBecause of the propensity of First Families of Virginia (FFV) to marry within their narrow social ranks for many generations, John Page is counted as a progenitor of many other FFV families. These include the families of Byrd, Chiles, Dilliard, Tyler, Pendleton, Burwell, Nelson, Randolph, Carter, Harrison, Waller and others.\n\nSeveral sites of the Page family in Virginia and West Virginia have historical and archaeological significance. \n\nThe Royal African Company's agent in Virginia in the 1670's, the Colonel was heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade, not only trading and profiting on the chattel slave trade of human beings (agents received a seven-percent commission on sales), but also enslaving numerous people on his various properties as well.\n\n\n\n"}

Such a seller is a special case in contract law. Ordinarily, a seller whose buyer breaches a contract and refuses to purchase the goods can recover from the breaching buyer only the difference between the contract price and the price for which the seller ultimately sells the goods to another buyer (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).\n\nIn the case of a lost volume seller, the seller goes on to sell the goods to someone else, usually for the same price. Under the usual measure of damages, such a seller would have no damages (the contract price less the sale price to the other customer is zero) and the breaching buyer would have no liability.\n\nThe objective of the law of contracts with respect to damages is to put the aggrieved party in as good a position as the aggrieved party would have been in if the breaching party had fully performed.

The lost volume seller would have had the profit from two sales if the first buyer had performed instead of the profit from only one sale as a result of the first buyer’s breach. In such a case, certain law (including Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States) permits the aggrieved seller to recover the lost profit that the seller would have made had the buyer not breached (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).\n\nLost volume sellers tend to be those whose capacity to sell or to produce or acquire the subject goods is sufficiently large to meet the demands of all customers who seek to buy those goods. The term generally arises in the context of a breach of contract action in which the selling party seeks to recover against a breaching buyer who repudiates his or her promise to buy. For a lost volume seller, the failure to make one sale (i.e., due to the buyer's breach) reduces the seller's profits by the amount of profit that would accrue from that sale.\n\nFor example, suppose a T-shirt maker has 100 T-shirts. If a customer agrees to buy a shirt from the seller and then breaches that agreement (i.e. refuses to take delivery and pay), the seller will likely be able sell the shirt at the same price to the next customer who walks in. Such a seller has no damages by the usual measure (i.e., there is no difference between the contract price with the breaching buyer and the price paid by the buyer who subsequently bought the T-shirt).\n\nHowever, if that seller has the ability to sell a shirt to any customer that walks in, then the customer who breaches the agreement to buy has prevented the seller from earning profit that the seller would have earned had the agreement been honored. The initial buyer’s breach has caused the seller to receive the profit from only one sale (the sale to the second buyer) instead of the profit from two sales (the sale to the second buyer plus the sale for which the breaching buyer contracted).\n\nAccordingly, the T-shirt seller can recover from the breaching buyer the profit that the seller would have made on the sale of the T-shirt for which the breaching buyer contracted.\n\n"}

{"id": "2820412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2820412", "title": "Office of Technology Assessment", "text": "Office of Technology Assessment\n\nThe Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was an office of the United States Congress from 1972 to 1995. OTA's purpose was to provide Congressional members and committees with objective and authoritative analysis of the complex scientific and technical issues of the late 20th century, i.e. technology assessment. It was a leader in practicing and encouraging delivery of public services in innovative and inexpensive ways, including early involvement in the distribution of government documents through electronic publishing. Its model was widely copied around the world.\n\nPrinceton University hosts The OTA Legacy site, which holds \"the complete collection of OTA publications along with additional materials that illuminate the history and impact of the agency\". On July 23, 2008 the Federation of American Scientists launched a similar archive that includes interviews and additional documents about OTA.\n\nCongress established the Office of Technology Assessment with the Technology Assessment Act of 1972. It was governed by a twelve-member board, comprising six members of Congress from each party — half from the Senate and half from the House of Representatives. During its twenty-four-year life it produced about 750 studies on a wide range of topics, including acid rain, health care, global climate change, and polygraphs.\n\nCriticism of the agency was fueled by \"Fat City\", a 1980 book by Donald Lambro that was regarded favorably by the Reagan administration; it called OTA an \"unnecessary agency\" that duplicated government work done elsewhere. OTA was abolished (technically \"de-funded\") in the \"Contract with America\" period of Newt Gingrich's Republican ascendancy in Congress.\n\nWhen the 104th Congress withdrew funding for OTA, it had a full-time staff of 143 people and an annual budget of $21.9 million. The Office of Technology Assessment closed on September 29, 1995. The move was criticized at the time, including by Republican representative Amo Houghton, who commented at the time of OTA’s defunding that \"we are cutting off one of the most important arms of Congress when we cut off unbiased knowledge about science and technology\".\n\nCritics of the closure saw it as an example of politics overriding science, and a variety of scientists have called for the agency's reinstatement.\n\nWhile the OTA was closed down, the idea of technology assessment survived, in particular in Europe. The European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network coordinates members of technology assessment units working for various European governments. The US Government Accountability Office has meanwhile established a TA unit, taking on former duties of the OTA.\n\nWhile campaigning in the 2008 US presidential election, Hillary Clinton pledged to work to restore the OTA if elected President. On April 29, 2009, House of Representatives member Rush Holt of New Jersey wrote an op-ed piece articulating the argument for restoring the OTA.\n\nIn April 2010 The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars released a report entitled \"Reinventing Technology Assessment\" that emphasized citizen engagement and called for performing the functions of the OTA by creating a nationwide network of non-partisan policy research organizations, universities, and science museums: the Expert & Citizen Assessment of Science & Technology (ECAST) network. ECAST would conduct both expert and participatory technology assessments for Congress and other clients. The author of the report was Dr. Richard Sclove of the Loka Institute. The report states that the drive to modernize OTA was initiated by Darlene Cavalier, a popular citizen science advocate and author of the Science Cheerleader blog. Cavalier outlined the idea of the citizen network in a guest blog post for Discover Magazine's The Intersection. She introduced the concept in an article in Science Progress in July 2008.\n\n\n"}

Furthermore, a complex COM-interface and a user-node with predefined template are available so that user can self-integrate extern programs for ease of use. The insertion of any system to an arbitrary process chain is very easy using the graphical workflow editor. Collaborating different simulation model classes is possible as networks, finite-element-method, multi-body-system, material test bench etc.\n\nData mining is the process of extracting hidden patterns from data. Data mining identifies trends within data that go beyond simple data analysis. Through the use of sophisticated algorithms, non-statistician users have the opportunity to identify key attributes of processes and target opportunities. Data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool to transform this data into information. It is commonly used in a wide range of applications such as manufacturing, marketing, fraud detection and scientific discovery etc.\n\nLocal Sensitivity as correlation coefficients and partial derivatives can only used, if the correlation between input and output is linear. If the correlation is nonlinear, the global sensitivity analysis has to be used based on the variance-relationship between input- and output-distribution as Sobol index. With sensitivity analysis, the system complexity can be reduced and the cause-and-effect chain can be explained.\n\nThe variability, uncertainty, tolerance and error of the technical systems play an important part by the product design process. These cause by manufacturing inaccuracy, process uncertainty, environment influences, abrasion and human factors etc. They are characterized by a stochastic distribution. The deterministic simulation cannot predict the real system behaviors due to the input variability and uncertainty, because one model calculation shows only one point in the design space. Probabilistic simulation has to be performed. Thereby, the output distributions will be calculated from input distributions based on the deterministic simulation model by any simulation system. The realistic system behaviors can be derivate from these output distributions.\n\nThe variability of parameters causes often a failure of the system. Reliability analysis (Failure mode and effects analysis) investigates the boundary violation of output due to input variability. The failure mechanisms of components are known in the specification for the product development. They are identified by measurement, field data collection, material data, customer-specifications etc. In the simulation, the satisfaction of all product specifications is defined as constraints of the simulation results. The system reliability is given, if all constraints scatter insight the defined boundaries. Although a nominal parameter simulation shows that all values of the constraints are located in reliable boundaries, the system reliability however cannot be warranted due to input variability. A part of the constraints variability, which violates the defined boundaries, is called the failure probability of the solution. Reliability analysis computes the failure probability of the single components and also of the total system at a given time point.\n\nMeta-modeling or Surrogate model is a process to win the mathematical relationship between design parameters and product characteristics. For each point in the parameter space, there is a corresponding point of the design space. Many model calculations should be performed to show the relationship between input and output systematically (Full Factorial Design). For a high computing effort of the product model, it is practically infeasible. Adaptive response surface methodology can be used to solve this problem. \n\nPredicting fatigue (material) has been one of the most important problems in design engineering for reliability and quality. They have several practical uses: rapid design optimization during development phase of a product and predicting field use limits as well as failure analysis of product returned from the field or failed in qualification test. Fatigue analysis focus on the thermal and mechanical failure mechanism. Most fatigue failure can be attributed to thermo-mechanical stresses caused by differences in the coefficient of thermal and mechanical expansion. The fatigue failures will occur when the component experiences cyclic stresses and strains that produce permanent damage. \n\nIn development process of technical products, there are frequently design problems with many evaluation goals or criteria as low cost, high quality, low noise etc. Design parameters have to be found to minimize all criteria. In contrast to a single optimization, there is another order structure between parameter and criteria spaces at a multi-objective Optimization. Criteria conflict each other. Trying to minimize a criterion, other criteria may be maximized. There is not only one solution, but also a Pareto optimal solution frontier. Multi-objective optimization finds all Pareto solutions automatically with a single run. The multiple decision making support tool is also available to select one best suitable solution from them.\n\nVariability, uncertainty and tolerance have to be considered for design process of technical systems to assure the highly required quality and reliability. They are uncontrollable, unpredictable and cause the uncertainty satisfaction of the required product specifications. The design goal is assuring of the specified product functionalities in spite of unavoidable variability and uncertainty. The approach solving this problem is robust design of the product parameters in the early design process (Robust Parameter Design (RPD)). Thereby, optimal product parameters should be found. Within, the system behavior is robust and insensitive in spite of unavoidable variability. E.g. the consistent variability and uncertainty leads only to the smallest variability of the product characteristics. So, the required product specifications will be always satisfied.\n\n"}

They function as temporary statutes pending ratification by the Parliament; failing ratification they function as mere executive regulations.\n\n\"Ordonnances\" should not be confused with \"décrets\" issued by the prime minister (an order-in-council) or president, or with ministerial orders (\"arrêtés\"); these are issued either in matters where the Constitution allows primary legislation from the Council or as secondary legislation implementing a statute.\n\nIn the French justice system, the word can also refer to a summary ruling made by a single judge for simple cases.\n\nArticle 34 of the Constitution of France restricts certain legal matters to primary legislation to be enacted by Parliament. All other areas of law fall within the domain of delegated legislation in the form of orders-in-council (OIC) issued by the Prime Minister or ministerial orders issued by individual cabinet ministers.\n\nOrders-in-council and other delegated legislation issued in areas reserved for primary legislation are illegal, unless they are specifically authorized by statute. Such orders define implementation measures and details left out by the originating statute.\n\nFor various reasons explained below, the Executive may sometimes want to pass primary legislation in a field reserved by statute. The \"ordonnances\" are the constitutional means to do so.\n\nDelegated legislation can be repealed through litigation before the Council of State (acting in their role of legislative review) if they violate general legal principles or constitutional rights, whereas primary legislation may be ruled unconstitutional only through judicial review before the Constitutional Council. Statutes are thus relatively more solid.\n\nThe decisions made by the French President under art. 16 of the French Constitution, enabling him to take emergency measures in times where the existence of the Republic is at stake (a form of reserve powers) are not called \"ordonnances\", but simply \"décisions\".\n\nThe introductory sentence of an \"ordonnance\", as published in the Journal Officiel de la République Française, is: \"The President of the Republic [...], after hearing the Council of State, after hearing the Council of Ministers, orders:\". The word \"ordonnance\" comes from the same root as \"ordonner\" \"to order\".\n\nIn the French Fifth Republic, most \"ordonnances\" operate pursuant to article 38 of the French Constitution.\n\nThe Council of Ministers first introduces a bill before Parliament authorizing it to issue \"ordonnances\" to implement its program. The bill specifies a limited period of time, as well as a topic for the proposed \"ordonnances\". If the bill passes in Parliament, the French Cabinet can issue \"ordonnances\" on the given legal matter within the specified time period. The Executive must consult the Council of State on every \"ordonnance\"; the advice of the Council is compulsory but nonbinding.\n\nAn \"ordonnance\" must be signed by the French President, the Prime Minister and relevant ministers. This proved in 1986 to be a source of tension, during a period of cohabitation when President François Mitterrand and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac were of opposite political opinions, and the President refused to sign \"ordonnances\" requested by the Prime Minister, forcing him to go through the normal parliamentary procedure; it was however controversial at the time whether he had the right to refuse to sign them.\n\nBefore the time period has elapsed, the Cabinet must introduce before Parliament a bill of ratification for the \"ordonnances\", otherwise these lapse at the end of the period. Until Parliament has voted the ratification bill, the \"ordonnances\", similar to executive orders, can be challenged before the Council of State.\n\nIf they are ratified, they become like ordinary statutes. There is, however, no obligation that they should be ratified, in which case they are mere regulations; in fact, between 1960 and 1990, out of 158 \"ordonnances\", only about 30 were ratified. This can happen because even though the ratification bill has been brought before Parliament, it is not necessarily scheduled for examination and vote. If Parliament votes down the ratification bill, it does not go into effect.\n\nThe Constitutional Council and the Council of State have admitted that ratification, in addition to explicit means (vote on the ratification bill, or ratification amendment added to another bill), could also be performed \"implicitly\", when Parliament refers to an \"ordonnance\" as though it were a statute. However, implicit ratification was prohibited by a 2008 constitutional amendment.\n\nIt has occasionally happened that the Executive did not make use of the authorization that they had requested and obtained.\n\nIt is of particular importance that budget bills should be voted in a timely manner, since they authorize taxes and spending. For this reason, the Government can adopt the budget by \"ordonnances\" if Parliament has not been able to agree on it within 70 days after the proposal of the budget (Constitution, article 47). The same applies for social security budget bills, but with a 50-day period (Constitution, article 47-1).\n\nNeither of these procedures has ever been used.\n\nArticle 74-1 of the Constitution allows the Government to extend legislation applicable to Metropolitan France to overseas territories by \"ordonnances\". These \"ordonnances\" lapse if they have not been ratified within 18 months by Parliament.\n\nThe use of \"ordonnances\" is not controversial when used for technical, uncontroversial texts (such as the ordinances that converted all sums in French Francs to Euros in the various laws in force in France). \"Ordonnances\" are also used to adopt and adapt European Directives into French law in order to avoid delayed adoption of a Directive, which often happens and is criticized by the EU Commission and exposes France to fines.\n\n\"Ordonnances\" are also used to codify law into codes, in order to rearrange them for the sake of clarity without substantially modifying them. Such usage has however been criticized for the legal risks that it poses if the ratification act is never voted.\n\nThe use of \"ordonnances\" for controversial laws is generally criticized by the opposition as anti-democratic, and demeaning to Parliament (Guillaume, 2005), in much the same way as the use of article 49-3 to force a bill to be voted.\n\n\"Ordonnances\" have been extensively used as a form of rule by decree in periods where the government operated without a working Parliament: Vichy France, where the executive had dismissed Parliament and other democratic structures, the Provisional Government of the French Republic, until it could establish a legislature, and in the last days of the French Fourth Republic and the early days of the French Fifth Republic, until the new constitution had come into force and legislative elections had been held (article 92 of the Constitution, now repealed).\n\nCertain legal texts enacted by the King in the medieval and \"ancien régime\" eras were called \"ordonnances\", the best known of which today is the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts.\n\n\nThe main reference is article 38 of the Constitution of France.\n\n"}

Founded in 1972, SCI-Arc was initially regarded as - both institutionally and artistically - more avant-garde than traditional architecture schools based in the United States. The school consists of approximately 500 students and 80 faculty members, some of whom are practicing architects. It is based in the quarter-mile long () former Santa Fe Freight Depot in the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, and offers a variety of community events such as outreach programs, free exhibitions, and public lectures.\n\nSCI-Arc offers undergraduate, B.Arch, and graduate degree programs, M.Arch 1 and M.Arch 2 accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). SCI-Arc is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).\n\nSCI-Arc EDGE, the Center for Advanced Studies in Architecture offers four postgraduate degree programs: M.S. Architectural Technologies, M.A. Fiction and Entertainment, M.S. Design of Cities, and M.S. Theory and Pedagogy.\n\nIn addition to its undergraduate and graduate programs, SCI-Arc offers two summer programs: a four-week program for high school students, Design Immersion Days; and a four-week intensive, introductory program that explores design through experimental architecture, Making+Meaning.\n\nSCI-Arc was founded in 1972 in Santa Monica by a group of faculty and students from Department of Architecture at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, who wanted to approach the subject from a more experimental perspective than traditional schools offered. Originally called the New School, SCI-Arc was based on the concept of a \"college without walls\" and it remains one of the few independent architecture schools in the world. Initially, instead of academic hierarchies the School favored a horizontal relationship between professors and students, who took responsibility for their own course of study. Ray Kappe, who had founded the Pomona department, became the new school's first director, served in that position until 1987, and was awarded the AIA/ACSA Topaz Medal for excellence in architecture education in 1990.\n\nKappe was succeeded as director by Michael Rotondi, one of SCI-Arc's founding students. Neil Denari became director in 1997; Eric Owen Moss served as director from 2002–2015; Hernan Diaz Alonso was appointed Director and Chief Executive Officer effective Sept 1, 2015. Diaz Alonso has been a faculty member at SCI-Arc since 2001. He is known for championing the school's push toward a digital future and, prior to his appointment as Director, has served as the school's Graduate Programs Chair since 2010. Although SCI-Arc was once unaccredited and its finances unstable—Moss joked, \"We used to be considered one step ahead of the IRS, one step ahead of creditors\"—the school is now fully accredited, and its finances improved to the point that SCI-Arc was able to pay $23.1 million to buy its campus building in 2011. \"The main thing is to figure out a way for SCI-Arc to keep growing without losing its character and pedigree,\" Diaz Alonso said in an interview following his appointment as Director.\n\nThe open nature of SCI-Arc's program is reflected in the series of industrial buildings that have housed the school, where students are encouraged to design and construct their own studio environments, and occasionally full-scale projects. The school has been based in three locations – the first (1972-1992) a small industrial building in Santa Monica and later moved into the second, a much larger (architecturally unique concrete post & beam) industrial building (1992-2000) in Marina del Rey. In 2001, it moved to its current home, the 60,000-square-foot 1907 Santa Fe Freight Depot designed by Harrison Albright on the eastern edge of Downtown Los Angeles. When SCI-Arc arrived, the building was a stripped-down concrete shell. Today the building is on the National Register of Historic Places and the school has become an anchor for the city's Arts District. The school conducts design projects that engage with under-served members of the community. To these ends, SCI-Arc has been awarded a $400,000 grant by ArtPlace to develop two on-campus public performance/lecture spaces, as well as development for a third public venue in the surrounding arts district. Across the street, \"One Santa Fe,\" a 438-unit apartment complex designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture (MMA) opened in 2014.\n\nSCI-Arc attracts students from nearby and throughout the world in pursuit of the educational programs that the school offers. Most students have already completed some college level work; some already hold professional architectural degrees. SCI-Arc is serious about educating and challenging its students—but does it so in an unconventional atmosphere. It is not uncommon to see a student using his or her skateboard to get from one end of the building to the other, or to be working on a model with his or her dog napping nearby. Students actively engage in preparing the SCI-Arc Gallery exhibitions, help fellow graduating students in setting up their models for thesis presentations, and contribute to workshops that result in projects throughout the school, such as the graduation pavilion and other unique structures. Students have access to their SCI-Arc studio spaces 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nSCI-Arc offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), including a five-year Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) program, a 3-year Master of Architecture (M.Arch 1) open to applicants who hold a bachelor's degree or equivalent in any field of study, and a 2-year Master of Architecture (M.Arch 2) open to applicants with a prior undergraduate degree in architecture.\n\nIn the fall and spring terms, design studios, seminars and workshops led by SCI-Arc faculty and visiting instructors offer students a multitude of choices and perspectives. During the summer term, some courses are also open to upper-level students from other architecture programs and to the public. Summer at SCI-Arc features two intro to architecture programs open to the public: Design Immersion Days, a four-week intense design and architecture workshop for high school students, and MAKING+MEANING, a four-week foundation program in architecture that introduces the principles of architecture in a hands-on exploration of spatial experimentation, design methodologies and the creative process.\n\nIn addition to its undergraduate and graduate programs, SCI-Arc offers four one-year postgraduate programs in fields including architectural technologies, entertainment and fiction, design of cities, and theory and pedagogy.\n\nSCI-Arc's undergraduate and graduate programs culminate in two public events in which students present their thesis projects to renowned critics from around the world, including Peter Cook, Greg Lynn, and Pritzker Prize recipient Thom Mayne. \"SCI-Arc has long been one of this country’s best experimental labs in which designers speculate about the future of the human-made environment, and its thesis projects are its calling cards.\"\n\nGeneral rankings place SCI-Arc at #12 in undergraduate and #27 in graduate programs overall.\n\nMaking + Meaning is a four-week summer program at the Southern California Institute of Architecture that introduces the principles of architecture in a hands-on exploration of spatial experimentation, design methodologies and the creative processes.\n\nDuring this intensive program, students survey and challenge the discipline's boundaries by drawing, making and constructing. Methodologies range from material experimentation to compositional strategies; from imagination to inhabitation.\n\nMaking + Meaning students meet leading thinkers in architecture, engage in open dialogue, delve into the city of Los Angeles' wealth of experimental architecture and produce a portfolio of work crystallizing their explorations in the program.\n\nThe program derives its strength from the diverse backgrounds of its students. From those gauging their interest and curiosity in architecture, to those beginning an architectural degree, Making + Meaning is a platform for individual learning in a collective environment; an introduction to the discipline of architecture and a welcome to SCI-Arc's culture and community.\n\nSCI-Arc's public programs invite the community into the school to foster debate and understanding of architecture's capacity to transform the world. A recent program and exhibition, \"LA in Wien/Wien in LA,\" investigated the architecture of Los Angeles and Vienna and their respective influences on one another in over the last century. It brought together six esteemed international architects—Hitoshi Abe, Peter Cook, Eric Owen Moss, Thom Mayne, Peter Noever, and Wolf Prix of Coop Himmelb(l)au—to share their perspectives and experiences in a discussion led by Anthony Vidler. The full scope of SCI-Arc public programs includes lectures, exhibitions, faculty talks and other opportunities for interaction between the school and the community.\n\nEach semester's lecture series produces an eclectic selection of speakers from multiple disciplines, including architects, artists, film-makers, engineers, theoreticians, and performers. Speakers are selected by a forum of students, faculty, alumni, and administrators and the lectures are free and open to the public. Lectures are followed by a dinner in honor of the speaker, allowing students and faculty to interact more personally with the invited speaker. SCI-Arc lectures are broadcast for live viewing on the internet.\n\nSCI-Arc's Robot House, initiated by faculty members Peter Testa and Devyn Weiser, builds upon the school's strengths to create a next generation platform for experimentation and speculation on the future of architecture.\n\nSituated conceptually and physically between studio and shop, academy and industry, the lab focuses on multi-robot cooperation and collaboration using six state-of-the-art Staübli robotic systems. The Robot House offers a new design interface extending beyond a production facility. It creates unprecedented emulation, simulation and animation environments in which computational geometry, material agency and fabrication logistics merge. The introduction of video, vision and sensing technologies with the lab's robotic systems support feedback and exchanges between matter, data and form.\n\nProjects explore additive free-form fabrication tied to advanced composite materials. The robots themselves, relatively small in size and dexterity, support a reconfigurable 3D workspace with a wide range of applications including on-site construction.\n\n"}

One of the main premises of the book is that although people are often keen to blame themselves when objects appear to malfunction, it is not the fault of the user but rather the lack of intuitive guidance that should be present in the design.\n\nThe book was published in 1988 with the title The Psychology of Everyday Things. Norman said his academic peers liked that title, but believed the new title better conveyed the content of the book and better attracted interested readers. It is often referred to by the initialisms POET and DOET.\n\nNorman uses case studies to describe the psychology behind what he deems good and bad design, and proposes design principles. The book spans several disciplines including behavioral psychology, ergonomics, and design practice.\n\nA major update of the book, The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition, was published in 2013.\n\nIn the book, Norman introduced the term \"affordance\" as it applied to design, adding a perceptual dimension to James J. Gibson's concept of the same name. Examples of affordances are flat plates on doors meant to be pushed, small finger-size push-buttons, and long and rounded bars we intuitively use as handles. As Norman used the term, the plate or button \"affords\" pushing, while the bar or handle affords pulling. Norman discussed door handles at length.\n\nHe also popularized the term \"user-centered design\", which he had previously referred to in \"User Centered System Design\" in 1986. He used the term to describe design based on the needs of the user, leaving aside what he deemed secondary issues like aesthetics. User-centered design involves \"simplifying the structure of tasks\", \"making things visible\", \"getting the mapping right\", \"exploiting the powers of constraint\", \"designing for error\", \"explaining affordances\" and seven stages of action. He goes to great lengths to define and explain these terms in detail, giving examples following and going against the advice given and pointing out the consequences.\n\nOther topics of the book include:\n\n\nAfter a group of industrial designers felt affronted after reading an early draft, Norman rewrote the book to make it more sympathetic to the profession.\n\n"}

{"id": "244284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244284", "title": "Trinity Church (Manhattan)", "text": "Trinity Church (Manhattan)\n\nTrinity Church is a historic parish church in the Episcopal Diocese of New York located near the intersection of Wall Street and Broadway in the lower Manhattan section of New York City, New York. Known for both its location and endowment, Trinity is a traditional high church, with an active parish centered around the Episcopal Church and the worldwide Anglican Communion in missionary, outreach, and fellowship.\n\nThe Trinity Church has been significant to New York City's history for over 300 years. In 1696, Governor Benjamin Fletcher approved the purchase of land in Lower Manhattan by the Church of England community for construction of a new church. The parish received its charter from King William III on May 6, 1697. Its land grant specified an annual rent of 60 bushels of wheat. The first rector was William Vesey (for whom nearby Vesey Street is named), a protege of Increase Mather, who served for 49 years until his death in 1746.\n\nThe first Trinity Church building, a modest rectangular structure with a gambrel roof and small porch, was constructed in 1698, on Wall Street, facing the Hudson River. The land on which it was built was formerly a formal garden and then a burial ground. It was built because in 1696, members of the Church of England (Anglicans) protested to obtain a \"charter granting the church legal status\" in New York City. According to historical records, Captain William Kidd lent the runner and tackle from his ship for hoisting the stones.\n\nAnne, Queen of Great Britain, increased the parish's land holdings to in 1705. Later, in 1709, William Huddleston founded Trinity School as the Charity School of the church, and classes were originally held in the steeple of the church. In 1754, King's College (now Columbia University) was chartered by King George II of Great Britain, and instruction began with eight students in a school building near the church.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America, following the departure of General George Washington and the Continental Army shortly after Battle of Long Island and subsequent local defeats. Under British occupation clergy were required to be Loyalists, while the parishioners included some members of the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress, as well as the First and Second Continental Congresses.\n\nThe church was destroyed in the Great New York City Fire of 1776, which started in the Fighting Cocks Tavern, destroying nearly 400 to 500 buildings and houses, and leaving thousands of New Yorkers homeless. Six days later, most of the city's volunteer firemen followed General Washington north. Rev. Charles Inglis served throughout the war and then to Nova Scotia on evacuation with the whole congregation of Trinity Church.\n\nThe Rev. Samuel Provoost was appointed Rector of Trinity (1784–1800) in 1784, and the New York State Legislature ratified the charter of Trinity Church, deleting the provision that asserted its loyalty to the King of England. Whig patriots were appointed as vestrymen. In 1787, Provoost was consecrated as the first Bishop of the newly formed Diocese of New York. Following his 1789 inauguration at Federal Hall, George Washington attended Thanksgiving service, presided over by Bishop Provoost, at St. Paul's Chapel, a chapel of the Parish of Trinity Church. He continued to attend services there until the second Trinity Church was finished in 1790. St. Paul's Chapel is currently part of the Parish of Trinity Church and is the oldest public building in continuous use in New York City.\n\nConstruction on the second Trinity Church building began in 1788; it was consecrated in 1790. St. Paul's Chapel was used while the second Trinity Church was being built.\n\nThe second Trinity Church was built facing Wall Street; it was 200 feet tall, and longer and wider than its predecessor. Building a bigger church was beneficial because the population of New York City was expanding. The church was torn down after being weakened by severe snows during the winter of 1838–39.\n\nThe second Trinity Church was politically significant because President Washington and members of his government often worshiped there. Additional notable parishioners included John Jay and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nThe third and current Trinity Church began construction in 1839 and was finished in 1846. When the Episcopal Bishop of New York consecrated Trinity Church on Ascension Day (May 1) 1846, its soaring Gothic Revival spire, surmounted by a gilded cross, dominated the skyline of lower Manhattan. Trinity was a welcoming beacon for ships sailing into New York Harbor.\n\nIn 1843, Trinity Church's expanding parish was divided due to the burgeoning cityscape and to better serve the needs of its parishioners. The newly formed parish would build Grace Church, to the north on Broadway at 10th street, while the original parish would re-build Trinity Church, the structure that stands today. Both Grace and Trinity Churches were completed and consecrated in 1846.\n\nTrinity Church held the title of tallest building in the United States until 1869, when it was surpassed by St. Michael's Church, Old Town, Chicago. At the time of its completion, Trinity's spire and cross comprised the highest point in New York, until it was surpassed in 1883 by the stone tower of the Brooklyn Bridge, and in 1890 by the New York World Building.\n\nIn 1876–1877 a reredos and altar were erected in memory of William Backhouse Astor, Sr., to the designs of architect Frederick Clarke Withers.\n\nArchitectural historians consider the third and present Trinity Church building, built in 1846 and designed by architect Richard Upjohn, the first and finest example of Gothic Revival architecture. In 1976 the United States Department of the Interior designated Trinity Church a National Historic Landmark because of its architectural significance and its place within the history of New York City.\n\nOn July 9, 1976, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Trinity Church. Vestrymen presented the Queen with a symbolic \"back rent\" of 279 peppercorns.\n\nSince 1993, Trinity Church has hosted the graduation ceremonies of the High School of Economics and Finance. The school is located on Trinity Place, a few blocks away from the church. Guided tours of the church are offered daily at 2 p.m.\n\nDuring the September 11 attacks, people took refuge inside the church from the massive debris cloud produced by the first World Trade Center tower collapse. Some of the chapel pew's paint was rubbed off from the people taking refuge. The pews were later replaced, but one still exists at the back of the chapel for remembrance of the events on 9/11. Falling wreckage knocked over a giant sycamore tree that had stood for nearly a century in the churchyard of St. Paul's Chapel, part of Trinity Church's parish, located several blocks north of Trinity Church. Sculptor Steve Tobin used its roots as the base for a bronze sculpture titled \"Trinity Root\", which stood in front of the church at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway until December 2015 when it was moved by the church to its conference center in Connecticut. The move was controversial as it damaged the sculpture, which was later repaired, and the artist has objected to its eviction.\n\nTrinity is located near Zuccotti Park, the location of the Occupy Wall Street protest. It offered both moral and practical support to the demonstrators but balked when church-owned land adjoining Juan Pablo Duarte Square was demanded for an encampment. For withholding this property the church hierarchy were criticized by others within the Anglican movement, most notably Archbishop Desmond Tutu. On December 17, 2011, occupiers, accompanied by a few clergy, attempted to occupy the land (known as LentSpace), which is surrounded by a chain-link fence. After demonstrating in Duarte Park and marching on the streets surrounding the park, occupiers climbed over and under the fence. Police responded by arresting about 50 demonstrators, including at least three Episcopal clergymen and a Roman Catholic nun.\n\nThere are three burial grounds closely associated with Trinity Church:\n\nThe tower of Trinity Church currently contains 23 bells, the heaviest of which weighs 27 U.S. hundredweight (1225 kg).\n\nEight of these bells were cast for the tower of the second church building and were hung for ringing in the English change ringing style. Three more bells were added later. In 1946 these bells were adapted for swing chiming and sounded by electric motors.\n\nA project to install a new ring of 12 additional change ringing bells was initially proposed in 2001 but put on hold in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, which took place three blocks north of the church. This project came to fruition in 2006, thanks to funding from the Dill Faulkes Educational Trust. These new bells form the first ring of 12 change-ringing bells ever installed in a church in the United States. The installation work was carried out by Taylors, Eayre and Smith of Loughborough, England, in September 2006.\n\nIn late 2006, the ringing of the bells for bell practice and tuning caused much concern to local residents, some of whose windows and residences are less than 100 feet at eye level from the bell tower. The church then built a plywood deck right over the bells and placed shutters on the inside of the bell chamber's lancet windows. With the shutters and the plywood deck closed, the sound of the bells outside the tower is minimal. The shutters, and hatches in the plywood deck, are opened for public ringing.\n\nPublic ringing takes place before and after 11:15 a.m. Sunday service and on special occasions, such as 9/11 commemorations, weddings, and ticker-tape parades. Details of the individual bells can be found at Dove's Guide for Church Bellringers.\n\nTrinity Church has three sets of impressive bronze doors, donated by William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor in memory of his father, John Jacob Astor III. Conceived by Richard Morris Hunt, they date from 1893 and were produced by Karl Bitter (east door), J. Massey Rhind (south door), and Charles Henry Niehaus (north door). The north and east doors each consists of six panels from Church history or the Bible, and the south door depicts the history of New York in its six panels.\n\nTrinity Church, as an Episcopal parish in the Anglican Communion, offers a full schedule of Daily Prayer and Eucharist services throughout the week, and based on the Book of Common Prayer; it is also available for special occasions, such as weddings and baptisms. In addition to daily worship, Trinity Church provides Christian fellowship and outreach to the community.\n\nSunday\n\nMonday–Friday\n\nThursday\n\nTrinity Church has a rich music program with an annual budget of $2.5 million as of 2011. \"Concerts at One\" has been providing live professional classical and contemporary music for the Wall Street community since 1969, and the church has several organized choirs, featured Sunday mornings on WQXR 105.9 FM in New York City. Trinity presents world-class music programs both in New York City and around the world via high definition video streaming.\n\nThe mainstay of Trinity's music program is The Choir of Trinity Wall Street, a professional ensemble that leads liturgical music at Trinity Church and St. Paul's Chapel, presents new-music concerts in New York City, produces recordings, and performs in international tours. The Choir is often joined by the Trinity Baroque Orchestra, Trinity's ensemble of period instrumentalists, and NOVUS NY, Trinity's contemporary music orchestra.\n\nTrinity is also home to a Youth Chorus, Youth Orchestra, Family Choir, Downtown Voices, change bell ringers, and a wide variety of arts programming through Congregational Arts. Visiting choirs from around the world perform at Trinity weekly. The entire music program is under the leadership of Julian Wachner, Director of Music and the Arts, a renowned conductor, composer, and keyboard artist.\n\nBeginning in the 1780s, the church's claim on 62 acres of Queen Anne's 1705 grant was contested in the courts by descendants of a 17th-century Dutchwoman, Anneke Jans Bogardus, who, it was claimed, held original title to that property. The basis of the lawsuits was that only five of Bogardus' six heirs had conveyed the land to the English crown in 1671. Numerous times over the course of six decades, the claimants asserted themselves in court, losing each time. The attempt was even revived in the 20th century. In 1959, the Internal Revenue Service sued over the compensation of the church's property manager, but the church prevailed in \"Stanton v. United States\".\n\nDisclosure resulting from a lawsuit filed by a parishioner revealed total assets of about $2 billion as of 2011. Although Trinity Church has sold off much of the land that was part of the royal grant from Queen Anne, it is still one of the largest landowners in New York City with 14 acres of Manhattan real estate including 5.5 million square feet of commercial space in Hudson Square. The parish's annual revenue from its real estate holdings was $158 million in 2011 with net income of $38 million, making it perhaps one of the richest individual parishes in the world.\n\nThe institution also owns the Trinity Court Building property, where it formerly housed its offices and preschool.

He was the third son of Virginia Agnelli (born Donna Virginia Bourbon del Monte) and of Edoardo Agnelli, and the youngest brother of Gianni Agnelli.\n\nHe served as a CEO of Italian carmaker Fiat from 1970 to 1976 and, on the death of his brother Gianni, was briefly chairman of the FIAT Group, 2003–2004, until his own death, aged 69, the following year. He was also chairman and of Juventus, the football team long-associated with FIAT and the Agnelli family, and was for a time the president of the Italian Football Association. \nHe was a senator of the Italian Republic, from 1976 to 1979. In 2015, he was posthumously inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.\n\nAgnelli was chairman of FIAT-controlled Juventus Football Club between 1956–61 and was honorary chairman from 1970–2004.\n\nAgnelli was chairman of Fiat France 1965–80, chief executive officer of Fiat SpA 1970–76 and vice-president 1976–93. He was chairman of Fiat Auto 1980–90 and a member of International Advisory Board 1993–2004.\n\nThough he was a senior executive in the family company, Fiat, he was sidelined from taking a leadership role by his brother Gianni until the latter's death in 2003. Only then did he take over as chairman of the whole Fiat Group, 2003–2004. The Group controlled several Italian newspapers and publishers in addition to the FIAT car-firms and Juventus.\n\nUmberto was in the process of restoring Fiat's fortunes, following a period in which the company's balance sheet, market share and share value had all been in decline, when he suddenly died of lung cancer after barely 18 months in control. Despite this, \"Forbes\" magazine estimated he was the world's 68th richest man with an approximate net worth of US$5.5 billion. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.\n\nAgnelli was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, the youngest of seven children. His life was beset by an unusual amount of tragedy and bereavement. His father Edoardo Agnelli perished in an air crash when he was one year old, and his mother Virginia died in a car accident ten years later when he was just 11 years old.\nIn 1959 Agnelli married the heiress \"Donna\" Antonella Bechi Piaggio, from the well-known business-family of Piaggio. They had three sons but their first, twin boys, died shortly after birth. The third son, Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, grew up to be the head of the maternal family-firm Piaggio, and was being groomed to succeed at Fiat, but died of cancer at the age of 33 in 1997. \n\nUmberto and Antonella Agnelli later divorced, and in 1974 Umberto married \"Donna\" Allegra Caracciolo di Castagneto. Allegra is the first cousin of Umberto's sister in law Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto, the wife of his brother Giovanni (Gianni). The ladies come from the old Neapolitan noble family that has, among other, the titles of nobility of Prince of Castagneto and Duke of Melito.\n\nUmberto and Allegra had two children: Andrea (born 1975) and Anna (born 1977). Andrea later followed in his father's footsteps by becoming chairman of Juventus, in 2010.\n\n\n"}

He created Viaden Media, a software development company, and after its sale he founded the investment company VP Capital. Prokopenya is one of the initiators and developers of the Belarusian Decree on Development of Digital Economy.\n\nViktor Prokopenya was born in Minsk, in the former Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in 1983. He was born into a family of scientists: his father received a doctorate in Physical and Mathematical Sciences, worked at the Belarusian State University and later at the Belarusian National Technical University, while his mother was a mathematician. He studied in schools No. 2 and No. 130, where he graduated with distinction. He received a: bachelor's degree in law from the Belarusian State University, bachelor's degree in information technology from the European Humanities University and a degree in software development from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. He has also graduated from the Minsk IPM Business School (gaining a master's degree in Business Administration), before continuing his higher education abroad at Full Sail University (gaining a master's degree in Internet Marketing), executive MBA courses at Stanford Graduate School of Business (Strategic Marketing) and Northeastern University in Boston (gaining a master's degree in finance). In 2017 he completed his doctorate in business administration at the SBS Swiss Business School.\n\nAt the age of 16 Prokopenya took on the responsibility of caring for his family, when his father, who had started a business in the 1990s, died in a car accident. In the 2000s, Prokopenya focused on IT consulting and running Viaden Media, the IT company that he founded. In 2006, he reoriented Viaden to develop their own IT products.\n\nIn 2009 the company launched a mobile applications department, headed by Yuri Gurski. The company developed numerous top-rated applications including \"All-in Fitness\", which sustained top ranking positions on the AppStore Healthcare & Fitness category in 40 countries for several months. Viaden achieved in excess of 200 million mobile application installations. By 2011 the company was the largest mobile phone software developer in the post-Soviet region. Prokopenya ran the company until 2011 when he sold it, for €95 million, to Teddy Sagi, an Israeli entrepreneur and founder of Playtech software company. Later Viaden Media was divided into two companies: Sport.com (the largest developer of fitness applications, and owner of sites sport.com and yoga.com) and the Skywind Group (which specialises in mobile and social games).\n\nIn 2012, Prokopenya founded his investment company, VP Capital, which has a focus on the technology sector. Later this year he started the fintech company exp(capital), which develops solutions for banks and brokers in order to construct algorithms for high frequency market making. The company is located in the Belarus High Technologies Park, and was ranked the best employer of the year in 2014. The mobile applications department of exp(capital) was acquired by the British company IG Holdings for an undisclosed sum.\n\nProkopenya also established VP Capital's Real Estate company in 2012 and acquired a number of key commercial real estate assets in the center of Minsk—by 2017, the company became the largest private owner of real estate of its kind in Minsk.\n\nIn December 2016, together with the Larnabel Ventures Fund, owned by Gutseriev family, Prokopenya announced his intention to invest over $100 million in artificial intelligence startup businesses. In February 2017 the partners announced five investment agreements, in which they have invested equally:\n\nIn the summer of 2017 it was announced that VP Capital planned to buy Paritetbank, and that the $50 million deal had been approved by the authorities. Alexander Timoshenko, the press secretary of the National Bank of Belarus, noted that the Belarusian regulator welcomes the Belarusian investor coming in to the banking sector, taking into account his good reputation and experience in the information technologies sector.\nIn an interview to Tut.By, Viktor Prokopenya claimed that bank acquisition is direct and important development of his experience in IT and fintech. Later, presidential edict approving the sale of Paritetbank was abolished. However, his company claimed that their focus is fintech of capital.com which develops mobile applications in sphere of finances. VP Capital also attempted to acquire Sberbank's banking business in Ukraine, but later withdrew the deal in order to focus on other projects.\n\nIn March 2017 Viktor Prokopenya proposed development of legislation for the use of autonomous cars, cryptocurrency and the development of initiatives designed to stimulate the IT industry in Belarus. On 22 December 2017, President Alexander Lukashenko signed into law the Decree on the Development of a Digital Economy.\n\nViktor Prokopenya became the top taxpayer of Belarus for the years 2016 and 2017, consecutively.\n\nViktor Prokopenya initiated legislation changes that were aimed to: introduce special tax remunerations until 2049 for IT sector, remove bureaucracy and regulate distributed ledger technologies. The regulation was called “Decree 8” was approved and went into force on 28 March 2018. Decree 8 initiative was criticized by Belarussian economist Serge Chaly, who pinpointed a number of bubbles in distributed ledger technology space.\n\nHe also argued, that it doesn't help the broader economy when IT industry receives special tax regime. As a result of decree 8 regulations IT sector grew 40% in 2018 contributing to 25% of Belarussian GDP growth in 2018. However, Denis Filazarovich on Kastrychnicki economichny forum said that he doesn't see how this growth can continue at this rate. Prokopenya argued, that providing improved fiscal incentives will make IT grow, not at the expense of Belarussian economy, but due to increasing Belarussian IT sector share in international markets. Arguing that Belarus will get more export proceeds and that the whole economy will be grow due to a multiplier effect. Viktor Martinovich argued that regulating IT under different rules compared to the rest of economy is not a sustainable practice, and that it is necessary to make structural changes in both the economy and government to develop Belarus as a whole.\n\nViktor Prokopenya invited S.Chaly to publicly discuss the new legislation concerning the regulation of the IT industry and cryptocurrencies. Sergei Chaly initially agreed but later changed his mind”.\n\nIn June 2018, Viktor Prokopenya commented the opening of the restaurant nearby Kurapaty. According to him, the restaurant should be closed, not by the state, but by the owner, and all socially responsible Belarusians should boycott all restaurants owned by the owner.\n\nOn November 5, 2018, at the International Economic Forum (IEF) Prokopenya supported the idea of a moratorium relating to the death penalty in Belarus. He argued that this is good for society and that this would reduce the cost of interest payouts on the state debt of Belarus. Prokopenya said that Belarus pays around 5% a year interest on debt obligations and that this is high for Belarus, which has debt less than 30% of its GDP. Critics argued that these calculations are inaccurate and that there is no connection between abolishing the death penalty in Belarus and reducing the country's debt burden. Some critics agreed that a moratorium on the death penalty will improve relations between Belarus and the European Union, and that this could affect the rating of the Belarusian Eurobonds and possibly rendering new debt cheaper.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, Viktor Prokopenya was detained by Belarusian state authorities and was suspected in unregistered business activity, earning profits to the sum of $650,000. Deutsche Welle, and Belarusian IT experts alleged that the detainment of Viktor Prokopenya could potentially cause hundreds of million of dollars in damages to Belarus. The IT business community came to the defense of Prokopenya Viktor Prokopenya was released on bail. In February 2016, all allegations against him were dropped after authorities failed to uncover any violations.\nThe story of the investigation gained widespread media coverage in Belarus. At the end of 2017, Prokopenya's legal advisors approached various Belarusian media channels, including BelaPAN, BelTA, European Radio for Belarus, Narodnaja Volya, Nasha Niva, Onliner.by, Tut.By, requesting the removal or correction of old news stories which contained incorrect information. Many outlets corrected the publications or deleted them, and this provoked discussions concerning journalism ethics.\n\nThe Belarusian media has repeatedly included Prokopenya in the rankings of notable Belarusian entrepreneurs. In the list of the 200 most successful and influential businessmen of Belarus, published by the Internet newspaper Ezednevnik, Prokopenya was awarded the 184th place in 2011, the 47th in 2013, the 45th in 2016, the 23rd in 2017, and the 12th in 2018. In the list of 25 most influential businessmen of Belarus from 1992 till 2017, also published by Ezhednevnik, he received 13th place. Viktor Prokopenya has been named Belarus's \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" three times.\n\nProkopenya has 4 million followers on Instagram making him the most followed instagrammer in Belarus, and the third most followed enterpeneur influencer with in the UK.\n\nProkopenya is married and has two sons. He lives and works in London. His hobbies include photography, hockey, snowboarding, diving, cycling and reading.\n\n"}

After his confirmation, he began to learn printing, but was later apprenticed to a marble chipper. While taking classes at the Copenhagen Technical College, his drawings attracted the attention of G.F. Hetsch, who advised him to take up porcelain painting. After completing his courses, he was given a position at the Royal Porcelain Factory, which he held from 1862 to 1867. \n\nBeginning in 1861, he also attended classes at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts; passing his final exam in 1866. He began to have showings at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition and, in 1869, was awarded the . \n\nFor several years, he worked to perfect a method to improve the reproduction of drawings by printing press. In 1872, he received a patent for his processes and set up a workshop for what he called the \"Heliotype\" (a process similar to hectography). Later, he also produced phototypes. In 1880, he joined with the photographer, , to create \"Pacht & Crones Illustrationsetablissement\". Crone left the company in 1885 and was replaced by the drawing teacher, . That same year, Pacht started the \"Skandinavisk Panoptikon\", a combination wax museum and cabinet of curiosities.\n\nIn 1887, he opened a factory that produced intaglio ink and paint tubes. In 1890, the company went public as an aktieselskab called the \"Danske Bogtrykkeres Farvefabrik\", but he continued as General Manager. In 1896, he presented the first moving pictures in Denmark in a wooden structure called the \"Panorama\" at the square in front of Copenhagen's city hall. His building and equipment were lost to a suspicious fire, but he soon re-established his shows (renamed the \"Kineoptikon\") at his Panoptikon.\nHis activities made him a wealthy man, but also ensured that his output as a painter was rather small. Just before his death in 1912, he and his second wife, Oline, created the \"Vilhelm Pachts Kunstnerboligs Legat\" (Artist-Dwelling Legacy), which turned his mansion, \"Pachts Bo\", into housing for indigent artists.\n\n"}
