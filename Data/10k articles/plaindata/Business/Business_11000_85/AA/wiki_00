{"id": "4746507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4746507", "title": "Business process mapping", "text": "Business process mapping\n\nBusiness process mapping refers to activities involved in defining what a business entity does, who is responsible, to what standard a business process should be completed, and how the success of a business process can be determined.\n\nThe main purpose behind business process mapping is to assist organizations in becoming more effective. A clear and detailed business process map or diagram allows outside firms to come in and look at whether or not improvements can be made to the current process.\n\nBusiness process mapping takes a specific objective and helps to measure and compare that objective alongside the entire organization's objectives to make sure that all processes are aligned with the company's values and capabilities.\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization or ISO 9001 : 2015 encourages a process approach to quality management. It is important to understand how each process relates to other processes within the organization and how those interactions impact Quality Management.\n\nThe first structured method for documenting process flow, the flow process chart, was introduced by Frank Gilbreth to members of ASME in 1921 as the presentation “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”. Gilbreth's tools were quickly integrated into industrial engineering curricula. In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, Allan H. Mogensen began training business people by using these tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in Lake Placid, New York. A 1944 graduate of Mogensen's class, Art Spinanger, took the tools back to Procter and Gamble where he developed their work simplification program called the Deliberate Methods Change Program. Another 1944 graduate, Ben S. Graham, Director of Formcraft Engineering at Standard Register Industrial, adapted the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart to display multiple documents and their relationships. In 1947, ASME adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth's original work as the ASME Standard for Process Charts.\n\nBusiness process mapping, also known as process charts, has become much more prevalent and understood in the business world in recent years. Process maps can be used in every section of life or business.\nThe Major Steps of Process Improvement using Process Mapping \n\nProcess mapping is capable of supporting several important business goals:\n\n\nProcess mapping has overlapped with software development incorporating tools that can attach metadata to activities, drivers and triggers to provide some automation of software process coding.\n\nQuality improvement practitioners have noted that various graphical descriptions of processes can be useful. These include: detailed flow-charts, work flow diagrams and value stream maps. Each map is helpful depending on the process questions and theories being considered. In these situations process map implies the use of process flow and the current understanding of the causal structure.\n\nSix Sigma practitioners use the term Business Process Architecture to describe the mapping of business processes as series of cross-functional flowcharts. Under this school of thought, each flowchart is of a certain level (between 0 and 4) based on the amount of detail the flowchart contains. A level 0 flowchart represents the least amount of detail, and usually contains one or two steps. A level 4 flowchart represents the most amount of detail, and can include hundreds of steps. At this level every task, however minor, is represented.\n\nFlowchart is a primary type of business process mapping. It consists of some symbols such as arrows, circles, diamonds, boxes, ovals, or rectangles. The type of Flowchart just described is sometimes referred to as a \"detailed\" flowchart because it includes in detail, the inputs, activities, decision points, and outputs of any process.\n\nThe example is Proposed Patient Appointment Procedure. It starts with \"preparation of appointment book\" followed by a decision whether the appointment is shore or fleet. If the appointment is fleet, inform patient they can call 1500 to make own appointments for next few days, if the appointment is shore, confirm 24 hours prior to appointment. Next confirm that the patient confirmed. If a patient did not call, the appointment is canceled, otherwise the patient is given a confirmation number. Finally confirm that the patient showed for the appointment. If not, a standby patient is placed in the appointment slot, the appointment book is marked \"Failure\" and a failure report is submitted from front desk to fleet liaison. If a patient showed for appointment, put \"Patient showed\" in appointment book.\n\nAn easy example to follow is making breakfast:\n\nWe must first understand that making breakfast is a process. The ingredients are the inputs and the final breakfast ready to be served is the output. This graph shows the breakdown of each process vertically and horizontally. For instance, cooking ingredients is broken down into all of the different tasks that need to be done: cook bacon, cook eggs, toast bread, and fry potatoes. These tasks are then broken down further below. In order to cook eggs, one must first heat the pan, pour the mixture, stir mixture, add pepper, and remove eggs. This is a prime example of how process mapping can be used in any situation/process in order to understand all of the different parts so that we can complete the process with a better understanding for more efficiency.\nAlthough this is just a simple example, many aspects of business, including supply chain, operations, marketing, finance, and accounting, use similar process mapping activities to improve efficiency.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17063370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17063370", "title": "Business war games", "text": "Business war games\n\nBusiness war gaming (Corporate war gaming) or business wargaming is an adaptation of the art of simulating moves and counter-moves in a commercial setting. Unlike military war games, or fantasy war games which can be set hundreds of years in the past, business war games are usually set in the present and are a relatively recent development, but they are growing rapidly.\n\nThe rationale for running a business war game is that it is a tool of particular value when the competitive environment is undergoing a process of change, as it allows decision makers to consider proactively how different players can react to the change, and to each other. The benefit of teams role playing competitors and developing more robust strategies is especially notable, and can be inferred from a quote such as the one below from Richard Clark, CEO of Merck and Co., who in an interview to USA Today said: \"I am a strong believer in if you’re going to develop a vision or a strategic plan for the future of a company that you have to engage the organization in doing that…it can’t be just the CEO or top 10 executives sitting in a sterile conference room.\"\".\n\nAt the Paul Merage School Of Business at University of California, Irvine the final exam for the competitive intelligence class is a war game in which the students role play various companies to try to win in the marketplace. Each year student teams have developed strategies - some of which have actually happened in the market place indicating that a war game is a very powerful predictive tool for businesss when planned properly.\n\nCurrently there are three schools of thought about business war game, depending on the underlying philosophy of their creators: \"Business is War\" war games, \"Business is a Game\" war games, and \"Business is Business\" war games. The three types have accordingly, different strengths and weaknesses, and are useful for different applications throughout business.\n\nSometimes abbreviated as 'BIW' war games, 'Business is War' games are a direct adaptation from the military war games, and envision competitors as the \"enemy\" and the goal as \"victory\" in a market \"battle\". These games are based on mathematical modeling of contestable markets, including chaos theory, random variable generation (Monte Carlo simulations), and econometric modeling of demand and supply conditions. Participants’ generated moves are fed into computer program which generates optimal solutions in the mathematical space. Not surprisingly these games come with a high price tag, and are advocated by large consulting firms which tend to work with the US military establishment.\n\n'BIG' war games regard business transactions as a game between participants with potentially conflicting goals. BIG advocates apply game theory, a branch of mathematics to business situations with the goal of finding an equilibrium, or \"stable\" solution (so called Nash equilibrium) whereby no one can further improve on the outcome. The solution can be computed over a large space of all possible (hypothetical) moves of the players. A leading proponent of this type of war games is Niall Fraser, a game theorist and the founder of a consultancy called Open Options. A variant on BIG is computer simulations’ games using simultaneous equations to solve for demand and supply equilibrium (not a game theory solution). Participants input numerical values for decisions on a wide range of business investments (in production, sales force, advertising, etc.), and receive a computer output of the equilibrium results.\n\nAlso referred to as 'BIB' regard business as neither a war nor a game. The goals and tactics of war are incompatible with business goals; competitors do not aim to defeat each other but to satisfy customers’ preferences better than others. Government precludes total victories and cooperation is as prevalent as competition. Similarly, BIB criticizes \"Business is Game\" thinking on the ground that hypothetical or generic moves are irrelevant or trivial, stable solutions are not a substitute for specific, real life practical and innovative strategies for management, and computer/mathematical simulations do not approach the complexity of competitive dynamics in real markets. Instead, BIB advocates using state-of-the-art competitor analysis techniques and real life competitive intelligence to generate an in-depth profiling of competitors through role playing. The goal of BIB is predicting most likely moves by most significant competitors or other third parties (customers, regulators) so that strategy can be pressure–tested in the most realistic setting. The creator of BIB games is Benjamin Gilad. A variation combines BIB war gaming with computer simulations. This approach, used by Mark Chussil, founder of Advanced Competitive Strategies, uses simulations to estimate the likely outcomes from moves made by a business, its competitors, and other relevant actors, across multiple scenarios. This approach allows for both competitive dynamics and quantitative analysis, at the cost of additional time to set up the war game.\n\nIn contrast to the often larger “Business is War”, “Business is a Game” and “Business is Business” war games, which all primarily deal with market level issues, Negotiation War Games are smaller in scope and only deal with business related negotiations. Even though the US military have long referred to the practice of ”War Gaming a negotiation”, the term ”Negotiation War Game” was first coined by Soren Malmborg in 2010.\n\nA \"NWG\" is a Business War Game conducted at negotiation level. I.e. A structured framework for conducting a preparatory Negotiation Simulation on a specific, upcoming negotiation.\n\nA Negotiation War Game is most often divided into three steps:\n1/ Gather Intelligence\n2/ Simulate Upcoming Negotiation\n3/ Debrief and calibrate negotiation strategy.\n\nBy adding Competitive Intelligence to the simulation, Negotiation War Gaming differentiates itself from normal mock negotiations and other training exercises. The act of gathering and including Competitive Intelligence on the forthcoming negotiation and its parties, lets participants in the Negotiation War Game gain an in-depth understanding of the negotiation itself and the negotiation parties.\n\nThe purpose of doing a Negotiation War Game is threefold; \n1/ Predicting your opponents' next move \n2/ Revealing opportunities, threats and issues \n3/ Developing and testing a calibrated negotiation strategy. \n\nEven though software applications can play an important role in the facilitation of a Role-Play Negotiation War Game, the method is inherently focused on role-play simulation. War Games can be used to prepare for virtually all two or three party negotiations. By gathering Competitive Intelligence on the actual negotiation (as well as the individuals involved) an accurate simulation can be created. A client’s employees will then become involved in the actual War Game by acting partly as the company itself, partly as the other negotiating party. Through a series of structured simulations, a tailor-made strategy can then be developed and calibrated.\n\nRole-Play Negotiation War Games are especially effective when preparing for Sales- and Procurement negotiations. Through more than 30 years of business usage and scientific research, the method has been shown to generate significantly better negotiation outcomes compared to other popular methods. (Please see Application section below for references).In 2010, 64,7% of young US Sales-Managers Role-Played their upcoming negotiations, making \"Pure Role-Play\" Negotiation War Gaming one of the most used negotiation preparation techniques in North America. \nA leading proponent and provider of these types of War Games is Outcome Simulations ApS led by Soren Malmborg. As of 2013, Outcome's Negotiation War Gaming method is taught in MBA courses on negotiation at Columbia Business School and NYU Stern School of Business.\n\nGiven the high budget requirements and long preparations time, BIW games are more appropriate for big companies' big decisions and large budgets, such as corporate games, involving top executives with considerable staff and consultant support. Corporate games are played over major portfolio decisions such as diversification and/or divestiture moves of the parent company (i.e., which acquisitions to go for, which business to get rid of), and over longer term horizons. BIW games are less appropriate for business units, or \"business\" strategy decisions, as their high price tag and extensive time required from top executives are no match for small scale games with more tailored application and flexible format. To fully understand the difference between corporate games played over corporate strategy (portfolio management) and business games played over business strategy (competitive strategy), read Michael Porter’s articles.\n\nGame theory and computer simulation games are appropriate for planning and decision support in industries in relatively stable state, known distributions of outcomes, and predictable competitors, as they are best suited for finding equilibrium solutions among a relatively large set of known variables (payoffs and moves). On the other hand, BIG games are handicapped in rapidly changing industries, markets where surprise moves by new players is a possibility, situations requiring innovative and creative approaches, and in decisions calling for specific practical ideas rather than more generic moves (such as raise, stay or lower prices by x%). Decision makers looking at war gaming should also be minded of game theory’s own lack of empirical support, as people seem to irrationally follow behaviors that do not result in their best outcome.\n\nBusiness war games employing role-playing and competitor analytical techniques are most beneficial in business strategy at the business unit, market, brands, product and project levels. BIB games have been applied with great success to new product launches, offensive and defensive moves against specific competitors (whose response is analyzed using the advanced competitor analysis techniques), in organizational development’s (training the next generation executive cadre) \"competitive landscape\" games, and in brand revival and new market entry situations. According to participants, BIB games provide touch reality-based challenge to strategies and plans that helps companies cope with uncertainty. They are less useful in conglomerate strategy as they apply to business strategy and not across unrelated industries. BIB are also more culture sensitive, and should be applied with caution in cultures where honest discussion of blindspots is less than appreciated. The methodological superiority of BIB games over other techniques received strong empirical support from a meta study on the effectivenes of predictions of competitive outcomes using \"role playing\".\n\n\"Pure Role-Play\" Negotiation War Games have shown to generate significantly better predictions of negotiation outcomes compared to other popular methods. \"Pure Role-Play\" Negotiation War Games have also been shown to ensure significantly lower prices in procurement negotiations, and greater writedowns in auditor vs. client negotiations concerning obsolete inventory. \"Pure Role-Play\" War Games have been used extensively in business negotiations. \"Pure Role-Play\" War Games are furthermore often used in politics. Negotiation War Gaming was used to prepare President Ronald Reagan for his negotiations with Gorbachev in Reykevik and Geneva in 1985 and 1986. Presidential candidate John Kerry used a Negotiation War Game to prepare for his first TV-duel with George W. Bush in 2002. Both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney used the method prior to the 2012 presidential TV-duels. The NTC (National Training Center, Fort Irwin. Ca.) recommend that all U.S. and Canadian Army officers be trained in the method before deployment.\n\nBoard games can be used for business war games. In this case, they are war games for civilians applied with a marketing warfare analogy to a market situation. In this case, these authors talk about creative competitive intelligence.\n\nTo some, the war metaphor implicit in \"business war game\" is an accurate or useful depiction of business and competitive strategy. Others find the war metaphor potentially counterproductive. Some companies play up the war metaphor simply to encourage out-of-the-box thinking while others downplay it with terms such as \"strategy game.\"\n"}

This central polygon, as the name implies, serves as the main economic and business center of the city. The neighborhoods within the bounds of Downtown are granted higher-desinty zoning by the \"Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional\". Some of the most affluent neighborhoods of Santo Domingo are located within the downtown even as growth has overflowed to other locations outside the area. Piantini, Naco, & Paraiso all experience high levels of urbanization and better than average quality of life. The area is mostly composed of mixed-development zoning having most of the commercial zoning on the main avenues while having mostly residential zoning in the inner streets.\n\nSome of the most important avenues of the city are located in the Polígono Central including \"Wiston Churchill\" avenue with very high banking and commercial activity, and \"Abraham Lincoln\" avenue serving as the main thoroughfare of the city-center. Since the late 1990s a general trend of vertical growth has been experienced throughout the area creating complications of traffic and lack of appropriate infrastructure to handle the higher density levels. Most of Downtown Santo Domingo does not have the adequate infrastructure to handle high-density office and residential buildings and until the late 1990s it was mostly composed of large family homes and low-rise buildings. Rapid urbanization has led to solutions like the new Santo Domingo Metro and the creation of two express urban corridors to the north and south of Downtown.\n\nThis is a list of the neighborhoods located within the boundaries of Downtown Santo Domingo.\n\nClub Paraiso and Club Naco each located in their respective neighborhoods are private members-only clubs that offer sporting facilities and activities on a daily basis. Club Naco being one of the most prestigious clubs in Santo Domingo. Also within central Santo Domingo is the Centro Olimpico JPD. There is not that many green space in Downtown Santo Domingo and it lacks city parks or private green space with the exception of those above.\n\nCentro Olimpico Juan Pablo Duarte is the main sport center of the city of Santo Domingo and occupies roughly the eastern fourth of the Polígono Central. Limited by Kennedy, Gomez, and 27 de Febrero avenues it serves as a multi-sport facility in which the 2003 Pan American Games and the 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games were hosted. Popular events like the Festival Presidente de la Musica Latina and concerts by The Jonas Brothers, The Killers, Maroon 5, La Ley, Shakira, Tiësto, and many other music artists have taken place in the Estadio Olimpico Felix Sanchez in the COJPD.\n\nPublic transportation is handled by the Santo Domingo Metro and the OMSA bus system\n\nDowntown Santo Domingo is currently served by line 1 of the Santo Domingo Metro on the intersections of Maximo Gomez with DR-1 and DR-3. Currently on construction is line 2 of the system which will have stops along Expreso John F Kennedy and avenues Wiston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, Lope de Vega, & Ortega & Gasset. In the near future, the construction of line 3 of the metro system along Expreso 27 de Febrero (DR-3) will enclose Downtown Santo Domingo with full mass transportation access.\n\nDowntown Santo Domingo is currently served by the bus service provided by the \"Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses\" which provides bus service along the John F Kennedy & 27 de Febrero corridors (west/east), and along the Maximo Gomez, Wiston Churchill and Tiradente avenues (north/south). The service is plagued by the lack of funding by the government therefore it is infrequent.\n\nPrivate transportation is by far currently the most popular form of transportation in Downtown Santo Domingo and as a consequence the city streets are plagued with traffic congestion. With the completion of Corredor Duarte(2010) and line 2(2012) of the Santo Domingo Metro a relieve to the current chaos could be accomplished\n\nWiston Churchill is a North-south avenue that runs through the western boundary of Downtown Santo Domingo. It borders to the west the neighborhoods of Paraiso, Yolanda Morales, and Piantini and borders to the east the middle-class neighborhood Ensanche Julieta and Evarito Morales. Wiston Churchill avenue is host to the largest concentration of commercial malls and banks in the city including \"Multicentro La Sirena/Super Pola\", \"Mall at the Acropolis\", \"Blue Mall\", \"Supermercado Bravo\" and locations of \"Scotiabank\", \"Citibank\", \"Banreservas\", \"Banco del Progreso\" and a significant amount of international fast food chains.\n\nAbraham Lincoln avenue is North-South avenue in the core of Downtown Santo Domingo. It serves as the major thoroughfare of the center and services the neighborhoods of Piantini, Naco, Yolanda Morales, Paraiso, and Seralles. A major avenue for business and offices and a variety of Shopping plazas are also located in the avenue. Lope De Vega avenue starts out in Abraham Lincoln avenue and splits off in a Northeast direction towards John F Kennedy avenue\n\nMaximo Gomez part of DR-13 is the eastern border of Downtown Santo Domingo.\n\nA short section of DR-1 named Expreso John F Kennedy runs through the north of Downtown Santo Domingo. It is composed of a series of elevated express viaduct which run above the intersection of Wiston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, Lope De Vega, Tiradentes, and Ortega & Gasset avenues. An underpass under Maximo Gomez completes John F Kennedy as an urban corridor. To the west of Downtown Santo Domingo the corridor become highway Juan Pablo Duarte and to the east it becomes Expreso Quinto Centenario.\n\n\n"}

He faced a Conscientious Objector Tribunal, refusing to seek favourable treatment by declaring himself a Quaker. He was, however, permitted to join the FAU, with whom he worked until 1947. His service included a period of war relief work in China.\n\nWhen he returned, he trained as an accountant and joined the family firm, Jacob's Biscuits, in 1949.

As a rule, there are many categories and prizes. Hundreds of companies, mostly startups, participate as candidates.\n\nAs of 2016, major fintech awards ceremonies are held in India, Australia, Canada, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, South Africa, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States. Two ceremonies are not national but continental: the African FinTech Awards and Conference, and the European Fintech Awards.\n\nThe first \"African FinTech Awards and Conference\" will be held within the Finance Indaba Africa conference and expo in Johannesburg in October 2016. It will gather Africa's leading FinTech entrepreneurs, bankers, investors and advisors.\n\nThe 1st \"Annual Australian FinTech Awards\" will be held on 23 June 2016. The awards will be given in thirteen categories. The project, product, research paper, campaign, or activity that is entered must have been created, developed or released in the 18 months before the awards to be a valid entry.\n\nFounded by Glen Frost, the founder of FinTech Summit, and sponsored by Ashurst, the awards celebrate the achievements of the people and businesses comprising the fintech sector. \n\nThe Canadian FinTech Awards were created in 2014 by the Digital Finance Institute, a prominent global think tank for FinTech created in 2013, that has helped build the Canadian FinTech ecosystem. The first Canadian FinTech Awards were held on October 19 2015, in Toronto as part of the Digital Finance Institute's Annual National Conference in Toronto.\n\nThe \"European FinTech Awards\" is an organization that aims to disrupt traditional financial intuitions by providing a platform for fintech entrepreneurs to collaborate with one another. Like the Dutch and African awards, the European awards are the result of an initiative of Alex van Groningen BV, a Dutch financial publisher.\n\nThe awards start with the \"European FinTech 100\", a selection of innovative companies with ground-breaking ideas and technologies. The wide batch is chosen by the vote of more than 55,000 fintech enthusiasts from all over Europe (as of 2016). Then a panel of fintech experts reduces the selection to one hundred companies. The one hundred, in turn, are the pool from which the finalists are chosen. The finalists have the opportunity to pitch during the conference.\n\nThe first European FinTech Awards & Conference was held in Amsterdam on 14 April 2016. 413 companies from 34 European countries were nominated. 30% of all nominees were from United Kingdom.\n\nBehaviosec was the winner of the award for the Best European FinTech Company 2016. Winners in the 9 sub-categories were: Monese (Challenger Banks), Funding Circle (Alternative Finance), Ebury (Payments), Wikifolio (PFM), Everledger (Blockchain), Kreditech (Financial Inclusion), Knip (InsurTech), Backbase (Innovative Banking Software), and Behaviosec (Risk, Intelligence & Security).\n\nFinTech Awards is an event organized by the India FinTech Forum along with several startup accelerators. The winners are decided by a panel of industry stalwarts. The event focuses on actual working product demonstrations to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe \"Italian Fintech Awards\" originated from the Grand Prix for Italian startups, held in 2014. The Grand Prix and the Fintech Awards, both organized by CheBanca!, have been geared towards the best Italian fintech startups. The 2016 edition had a call for submission till 31 March. 12 finalists were chosen among the candidates.\n\nThe winner is awarded 25,000 euros, personalized workshops with startup coaches, and a visit to a startup bootcamp in London.

A 40-member jury gave awards in seven categories. The awards were attended by some 400 national and international fintech investors, companies, experts and executives.\n\nIn 2015, Adyen was the overall winner, receiving the award for a lasting breakthrough in the current payment industry. The winners in particular categories were: AcceptEmail (Payments), Five degrees (Banking IT), Bux (Personal Finance), Bitonic (Bitcoin), Sparkholder (Intelligence & Analytics), Symbid (SME).\n\nThe call for submissions for the first \"Swiss Fintech Award\" was published in October 2015. Any company founded by a Swiss citizen or headquartered in Switzerland could participate. A jury of 16 experts chose the top ten enterprises that would be trained in boot camps. The second round was a speed dating event with the jury and award sponsors in early February 2016. The three finalists pitched their ideas at the financial and economic forum \"Fintech 2016\" on 31 March 2016. The winner won a cash prize and a stay at the Accenture Fintech Innovation Lab in London.\n\nThe \"UK Fintech Awards\" ceremony was held in London on 13 April 2016. Sponsored by Bobsguide, the awards recognized achievements across the global financial technology industry.\n\nIn the United States, there are two major award ceremonies.\n\nThe \"Benzinga Fintech Awards\" (\"BZ Awards\") take place in New York. Their purpose is to \"showcase the companies with the most impressive technology, who are paving the future in financial services and capital markets.\" There are 18 awards.

{"id": "1536154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1536154", "title": "Frasch process", "text": "Frasch process\n\nThe Frasch process is a method to extract sulfur from underground deposits. It is the only industrial method of recovering sulfur from elemental deposits. Most of the world's sulfur was obtained this way until the late 20th century, when sulfur recovered from petroleum and gas sources became more commonplace (see Claus process).\n\nIn the Frasch process, superheated water is pumped into the sulfur deposit; the sulfur melts and is extracted. The Frasch process is able to produce high purity sulfur.\n\nThe Frasch sulfur process works best on either salt domes or bedded evaporite deposits, where sulfur is found in permeable rock layers trapped in between impermeable layers. Bacterial alteration of anhydrite or gypsum, in the presence of hydrocarbons, produces limestone and hydrogen sulfide in the sulfur cycle. The hydrogen sulfide then oxidizes into sulfur, from percolating water, or through the action of anaerobic, sulfur-reducing bacteria \n\nIn 1867, miners discovered sulfur in the caprock of a salt dome in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, but it was beneath quicksand, which prevented mining. In 1894 the German-born American chemist, Herman Frasch (1852–1914), devised his Frasch method of sulfur removal using pipes to bypass the quicksand. The process proved successful, on December 24, 1894, when the first molten sulfur was brought to the surface. The Union Sulphur Company was incorporated in 1896 to utilize the process. However, the high cost of fuel needed to heat the water made the process uneconomic until the 1901 discovery of the Spindletop oil field in Texas provided cheap fuel oil to the region. The Frasch process began economic production at Sulphur Mines, Louisiana in 1903.\n\nWhen Frasch's patent expired, the process was widely applied to similar salt-dome sulfur deposits along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The second Frasch-process mine opened in 1912 in Brazoria County, Texas. The Gulf Coast came to dominate world sulfur production in the early and middle 20th century. However, starting in the 1970s, byproduct sulfur recovery from oil and natural gas lowered the price of sulfur and drove many Frasch-process mines out of business. The last United States Frasch sulfur mine closed in 2000. A Frasch mine in Iraq closed in 2003 due to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Frasch process is still used to work sulfur deposits in Mexico and Poland.\n\nIn the Frasch process, three concentric tubes are introduced into the sulfur deposit. Superheated water (165 °C, 2.5-3 MPa) is injected into the deposit via the outermost tube. Sulfur (m.p. 115 °C) melts and flows into the middle tube. Water pressure alone is unable to force the sulfur into the surface due to the molten sulfur's greater density, so hot air is introduced via the innermost tube to froth the sulfur, making it less dense, and pushing it to the surface.\n\nThe sulfur obtained can be very pure (99.7 - 99.8%). In this form, it is light yellow in color. If contaminated by organic compounds, it can be dark-colored; further purification is not economic, and usually unnecessary. Using this method, the United States produced 3.89 million tons of sulfur in 1989, and Mexico produced 1.02 million tons of sulfur in 1991.\nThe Frasch process can be used for deposits 50–800 meters deep. 3-38 cubic meters of superheated water are required to produce every tonne of sulfur, and the associated energy cost is significant. A working demonstration model of the Frasch process suitable for the classroom has been described.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23681908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23681908", "title": "Galápagos syndrome", "text": "Galápagos syndrome\n\nThe term \"Galápagos syndrome\" has been used as a metaphor outside the field of business jargon. The term \"Galápagosization\", referring to the process of the isolation of Japanese \"Galápagos-thinking\", links this process to the Japanese island mentality.\n\nThe term \"Galápagos syndrome\" was originally coined to refer to Japanese 3G mobile phones, which had developed a large number of specialized features that were widely adopted in the Japanese market, but were unsuccessful abroad. Whilst the original usage of the term was to describe highly advanced phones that were incompatible outside of Japanese networks, as the mobile phone industry underwent drastic changes globally, the term was used to emphasize the associated anxiety about how the development of Japanese mobile phones and those in the worldwide economy went along different paths. A derived term is , blending with , used to refer to Japanese feature phones, by contrast with newer smart phones.\n\nAcross Japan, the majority of the 190,000 ATMs do not accept bank and credit cards that have been issued outside of the country. Currently, only about 20,000 post offices and convenience stores allow retrieving cash using non-Japanese bank cards. Due to pressure from the Japanese government concerning this issue, by 2020 the number of ATMs that accept cards issued outside Japan is estimated to increase from 48,000 to 80,000. Despite increasing numbers of international tourists in Japan, the country still attracts relatively few tourists according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, which ranked Japan 27th in the list of most visited countries 2013.\n\nIn 2004 the wallet phone was introduced in Japan as a means to allow mobile payment alongside numerous other applications. In some ways the wallet phone can be seen as a predecessor of mobile payment tools that were later released on the global market such as Apple Pay or Google Wallet. The complete integration of multiple tools served to make the classical wallet redundant as the phone allows all types of payments, having train tickets or other everyday needs to be organized on the phone. In many ways the Japanese contactless infrastructure has been and is superior as compared to the current state in rest of the world.\n\nKei Cars (\"light cars\") are small four-wheeled vehicles/cars that have an engine of less than 660cc and enjoy preferential treatment in the form of tax advantages and lower insurance cost. Originally the Japanese government encouraged the use of those \"light cars\". This category of cars features a number of different car types including sport cars, minivans and commercial vehicles. However, Kei cars are not seen as profitable in export markets and therefore are only part of the Japanese automobile market. Despite no significant global success, major Japanese car manufacturers such as Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu and Honda still produce models belonging into the Kei car category. Since the Kei car has a significant portion of Japanese car market, Japanese auto makers cannot ignore them. Although the regulatory differences between Kei cars and 1L cars are quite small, the tax benefit of Kei cars is considerable. Until the tax reform in 2013, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate was a quarter of that of 1L cars (¥7200 to ¥29500). This significantly lower tax rate gathered much criticism from European and US auto makers, and as such the EU, the US and Toyota do not make Kei cars. In 2013, the Japanese government revised the vehicle tax law. The new vehicle tax law became effective in 2015. With new vehicle tax law, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate is about 36% of that of 1L cars (¥10800 to ¥29500).\n\nThere are many associated issues with the inability to compete on the international export market. In order to revive the parts of the Japanese economy that have suffered from the \"Galápagosization\", affected businesses had to find the reasons responsible for the development.\n\nThe Galápagosization of Japan continues. According to a survey released today, a shocking two-thirds of the country’s white-collar workers said they didn’t want to work abroad ... ever.\n\nFurthermore, this has led a number of Japanese companies to adapt their business strategies. Hiroshi Mikitani, CEO of e-commerce company Rakuten, sees the exclusive use of Japanese in workplaces at the centre of the problem. Following his belief that \"a language will open your eyes to the 'global', and you will break free from this conventional wisdom of a pure Japan\", the co-founder and CEO of Rakuten made English the main language to be spoken in the company. Dr. Gerhard Fasol, the only European member of Euro Technology Japan's \"Galapagos study group\", stated that another reason for the non-success of some innovative Japanese products is Europe's conservative standpoint when it comes to certain standards. In the belief that it will improve international competitiveness Tadashi Yanai, the founder and president of Fast Retailing, has decided to change the way the firm works against classical Japanese business methods. A shift of the production of some textiles out of Japan to Southeast Asia was a move to the low-wage-labour market, that aimed to enable to price compete on the international textile market. Another factor which McKinsey & Company points out is the need for Japanese companies to adapt to stronger competition when entering global markets. This should be done by accepting to think in \"new and unfamiliar ways about organization, marketing, and strategy\", whilst the traditional practices that helped the companies to become a big player in the Japanese market shall be discontinued. Despite the fact that companies have started to address the issue, which \"could\" have a link to the total value of exports increasing over the past five years, there are concerns about the future Galápagosization of Japan.\n\nWith the aging and shrinking Japanese population, the fact that fewer and fewer students study abroad to acquire a more internationally oriented university education is reason for concerns over the future of the Japanese economy. Furthermore, there is a conception that the younger generation could enhance the Galápagos effect due to a lack of interest in international education and work placements. Kiyoshi Takeuchi, sociology professor at the Sophia university, describes the young generation to have less \"ambition and motivation\" as a result from the fear that a wrong move could have negative effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kessler also played tennis for the Netherlands in the 1906 Olympics in Athens, losing his first match to future Olympic champion Max Decugis. \n\nKessler was born in a very wealthy family from The Hague, the second son of six children. His father Jean Baptiste August Kessler (1853–1900) was the first director of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Petroleum Maatschappij (\"Royal Dutch Petroleum Company\"), now named Royal Dutch Shell. Guus studied engineering at Delft University.\n\nBoth Guus and his older brother Geldolph Adriaan Kessler were considered the \"crown princes\" of the Royal Dutch, but after their father died unexpectedly they had to work under their father's domineering successor, Henri Deterding. Dolf eventually left, at the urging of his fiance, and helped create and lead the Dutch steel company Hoogovens. Guus, by contrast, seemed to get along better with Deterding. \"The brothers were also strong willed but only Guus, the younger son, succeeded in controlling his emotions and avoiding coming into conflict with Deterding, in order to reach his ultimate goal,\" wrote Joost Junker and Jan Luiten van Zandem in their history of the company. The two brothers, as leading figures in two major Dutch business concerns, at one point formed a joint venture between the Hoogovens and Royal Dutch Shell to combat a threat to the oil business by IG Farben. Guus, who became a director of Royal Dutch in 1923, was instrumental in leading Shell into the petroleum-based chemicals business. \n\nGuus was the \"obvious candidate\" to lead Royal Dutch Shell after Deterding was forced out in 1936, but instead he was passed over in favor of a compromise choice. \"It must have been a huge disappointment to Kessler to see his life's ambition thwarted with fulfillment so near.\" He eventually achieved his dream and became director-general of Royal Dutch Shell in the years 1947-1949, retiring at age 60. For the next 12 years, he served as president-commissioner of the company. \n\nGuus and his first wife, Anna Francoise \"Ans\" Kessler-Stoop (1889–1983), had five daughters and one son. In 1932, they commissioned the noted French Fauvist Raoul Dufy to paint a portrait of the family on their horses, a work that now hangs in the Tate Collection in London. Ans was a noted collector of modern art, advised by her uncle C. Frank Stoop, and donated to the Tate Collection a substantial portfolio that included works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani and Edgar Degas. She purchased a Vincent van Gogh painting on paper in 1930 and it was sold at auction for 8.8 million British pounds in 1997 by a family trust. \n\nThe marriage of Guus and Ans ended in divorce. He married Thalia \"Lia\" de Kempenaer (1917–2000) in 1948.\n\n\n"}

Thus, an act is illegal without extrinsic proof of any surrounding circumstances such as lack of \"scienter\" (knowledge) or other defenses.

Al-Kharafi studied Business Administration at the Manchester Trade Faculty in Kuwait and was director of M. A. Kharafi & Sons before being elected to the National Assembly in 1975. He affiliated with the liberal deputies and was regarded as a pro-government liberal. However, Al-Kharafi has broken with the royal family on occasion. He criticized the ruling Al-Sabah family, and in July 2006 vigorously denounced the Israeli attacks on Lebanon saying that the war would \"turn us all into terrorists\".\n\nAl-Kharafi's family is wealthy. His brother Nasser was listed by Forbes as one of the richest people in the world. His sister, Faiza, was rector of Kuwait University. The University of Tirana on 7 October 2011 gave him an \"Honoris Causa\" title.\n\nJassem Al-Kharafi was born in Kuwait City in 1940, the son of Mohammed Abdul Mohsen Al-Kharafi, the founder of M. A.

A transcript of the interview was published in Alrai daily, which included Al-Kharafi's comment that too many reshuffles necessitate \"a review and an evaluation of what measures should be taken.\" Al-Kharafi said the reshuffle should not have been put off for the whole summer and that it indicated a \"policy of patching\" up problems, rather than solving them.\n\nIn response, Prime Minister Nasser issued a statement about Al-Kharafi to the state-owned Kuwait News Agency, which was splashed on the front pages of daily newspapers. In the statement, PM Nasser said that Al-Kharafi was overstepping in bounds in trying to influence cabinet selections: \"I have no doubt that ... the speaker realizes that his attempts to interfere in forming the Cabinet and affecting its decisions is overstretching his constitutional mandate.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth marked the first such public tensions between a speaker and a prime minister.\n\nOn July 13, 2008, Al-Kharafi publicly accused the West of provoking Iran on the nuclear issue.

I believe that a matter this sensitive needs dialogue not escalation, and it shouldn't be dealt with as if Iran were one of America's states.\" \n\nOn July 1, 2008, Al-Kharafi criticized the assembly's human rights committee for holding a meeting with US embassy officials without asking permission from the speaker in accordance with protocol rules. Khorafi blamed the US embassy for committing a \"procedural mistake\" by accepting an invitation by phone, insisting that \"the embassy should have told the committee that such meetings could not be arranged through this way and should have followed the right diplomatic procedures.\"\n\nThe meeting occurred on June 30, 2008, to discuss the latest US State Department report that accorded Kuwait a tier three status on trafficking in people for its treatment of domestic helpers and foreign workers. Later, the head of the committee, Waleed Al-Tabtabai, said the meeting was held on the basis of a request by the embassy and that the committee has not \"overstepped the authorities of the speaker or the foreign ministry,\" adding that the committee had received similar requests in the past.\n\nThe US embassy officials were reported to have refused to discuss the US decision to freeze the assets of the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society.\n\nAl-Kharafi was elected Speaker of the National Assembly in 1999. He was reelected as Speaker in all elections after until deciding that he would not stand for reelection in the 2012 National Assembly elections. This was due to Al-Kharafi wanting to focus on the family business after the death of his brother Nasser Al-Kharafi. Ahmed Al-Sadoun succeeded him as Speaker of the National Assembly.\n\nHe had an estimated net worth of US$1.25 billion.\n\n"}

His great grandfather was William E. Dodge, co-founder of Phelps Dodge & Co. His grandfather was Brigadier-General Charles Cleveland Dodge, who fought in the American Civil War. His parents, Charles Stuart Dodge and Flora Bigelow (daughter of John Bigelow) divorced in 1902. Flora, who had custody of their two children, John and his sister Lucie, remarried to Lionel George William Guest, a cousin of Winston Churchill, and moved to live in Montreal, Canada. \nHis education included Fay School and St. Mark's School, Southborough, Massachusetts and then McGill University in Canada.\n\nIt was through Churchill, who then was First Lord of the Admiralty, that Dodge became commissioned into the Royal Naval Division, arriving in England in August 1914. He became a naturalized British Citizen in 1915.\n\nDodge served in the 7th (Hood) Battalion of the Royal Naval Division first at Antwerp, then at Gallipoli. \nTogether with Bernard Freyberg and two other officers, Dodge decided where Rupert Brooke was to be buried, and dug the grave on Skyros, immediately before the Gallipoli assault.\n\nWhile serving as a lieutenant he was wounded at Gallipoli, and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross during this campaign. His award was published in the \"London Gazette\" on 8 November 1915.\n\nTransferring to the British Army in April 1916 with the rank of captain, to the 10th Battalion Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment (the recently raised 'Battersea Battalion), with whom he served on the Western Front, taking part in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. He was promoted to major on 22 Feb 1918, was wounded on more than one occasion, and ended the war as an acting lieutenant-colonel commanding the 16th Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment fighting in France and was further decorated with the Distinguished Service Order, this being gazetted on 3 June 1919.\n\nHe was demobilised on 18 December 1920, retaining the rank of major.\n\nDodge's American cousin, Braxton Bigelow, had also joined the British army to fight in World War I. He was killed in Flanders in 1917.\n\nHe made several expeditions through these years, including visits to China and Burma, however on a visit in 1921 to the Caucasus he was arrested by the Russian secret police as a suspected spy. After about two months of dreadful discomfort and narrowly avoiding execution, he was expelled from Russia with an order never to return there again. After this he changed his political view from socialist to conservative.\n\nHe served on London County Council as member for Mile End (East London) from 1925–31. He failed in his bids to get into Parliament for the Mile End parliamentary constituency in the 1924 and 1929 general elections. As part of his campaign for the London County Council election in 1926, Dodge engaged in a boxing exhibition match against a local professional and sustained a black eye. He became a member of the London Stock Exchange and took up the directorship of a New York bank.\n\nJohnnie married divorcee Minerva Sherman (née Arrington) (1902–1980) in New York about 1929. She was born in North Carolina; her great grandparents included Governor Tod Robinson Caldwell and General William Thomas Ward. They had two sons, David born 1930 and Lionel (known as Tony) in 1934, both born in England.\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, Dodge re-enlisted into the British Army, taking up the rank of major, serving with the Middlesex Regiment attached to the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division.\n\nWhile awaiting action during the 'phoney war' stage, Johnnie secured adoption as prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for Gillingham for the next general election which was postponed by hostilities.\n\nWhen the division surrendered at Saint-Valery-en-Caux in June 1940, Dodge attempted to evade capture, and swam out to sea in an attempt to board some ships he could see on the horizon. However the ships moved off before he could reach them, so he returned to land, covering approximately seven miles, before coming ashore. He was then captured by the Germans and became a Prisoner of War.\n\nDodge, with many other POWs from the Allied defeat in France, was forced to march towards Germany. During the march his bare feet became badly cut, and eventually he was put on a barge with other Army prisoners for transport to Germany. While on the River Scheldt he jumped overboard, but was handed over to a Luftwaffe officer by a frightened Dutch civilian. As he had become a captive of the Luftwaffe, he, with all Air Force POWs, was sent to the Dulag Luft reception and transit camp at Oberursel.\n\nAt Dulag Luft he met the Senior British Officer, Wing Commander Harry Day, who with the agreement of the Camp Kommandant, Major Rumpel, was made part of the permanent British staff of the camp. Rumpel arranged for the records to show that he had been transferred to the Royal Air Force, and from then on, he remained with the RAF POWs.\n\nEscape always appealed to Dodge's mind, and here he was with good company. In addition to Day, also at the camp were the escape-obsessed Jimmy Buckley and Roger Bushell.\n\nIt was from here that Dodge made his second escape attempt. A tunnel had been constructed by the permanent British staff, and in June 1941, Dodge, together with Day, Bushell and 14 others made their bid for freedom. None were successful, and all were recaptured. Dodge, and his travelling companion, were recaptured two days later walking along the autobahn a few miles south of Frankfurt. He was given a short period in solitary confinement before being transferred to Stalag Luft I at Barth, with all the other recaptured escapers.\n\nDodge became good friends with Harry Day who had taken over the role of Senior British Officer, and he helped Day with the running of the camp and with escape matters.\nHe was transferred to Stalag Luft III at Sagan in April 1942.\n\nHere Dodge again acted as deputy to Day. In November 1942, he was transferred again, this time to Oflag XXI-B at Schubin in occupied Poland. En route to that camp, he escaped from the train, but was immediately seen, shot at and quickly recaptured.\n\nHere Dodge escaped with 34 others (including Harry Day) through a tunnel on 5 March 1943. Again recaptured and after spending time in solitary, he was returned to Stalag Luft III in April 1943.\n\nDodge became involved with the organisation of what became known as The Great Escape. Partly due to his large size, he did not help build the tunnels, but instead helped create diversions such as choir singing to help disguise the noise of the digging.\n\nDodge was given a place in tunnel 'Harry' and escaped at approximately 0100 on 25 March 1944 as part of The Great Escape. He travelled with Flight Lieutenant James Wernham RCAF towards Czechoslovakia. They were caught during the afternoon of the same day at Hirschberg main railway station.\nTaken to the Kriminalpolizei at Hirschberg they met other recaptured escapers, including Bertram 'Jimmy' James.\n\nDodge was the first to be removed from Hirschberg, and was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he was later joined by Jimmy James, Harry Day and Flight Lieutenant Sydney Dowse.\nJames Wernham, together with 49 other recaptured escapers, was murdered under Hitler's orders.\n\nThe 'Great Escapers' were placed in Sonderlager A (Special Camp A) within the main camp. Here were housed a handful of other 'political' prisoners, including SOE agent Peter Churchill, two Russian generals, various other Russians, Poles, Italians and four British soldiers of Irish origin. Later they were joined by British Commando Jack Churchill.\nDowse and James almost immediately began another tunnel, which was kept secret from all non-British personnel. This was completed and used on the night of 23 September 1944, when Dodge, James, Day, Dowse and Jack Churchill escaped. \nDodge, who travelled alone, was on the run for over a month, and after receiving help from some French slave labourers, was arrested by a German farmer and returned to Sachsenhausen.\n\nHe, with the other four, who had also been recaptured, was placed in solitary confinement and chained to the floor in the death cells at the camp. Mainly through Harry Day's efforts all were spared execution.\n\nIn February 1945 he was released from solitary, and taken to Berlin where he was asked, by two senior German officials, to act as a peace envoy to the British government, with an offer of German surrender to the British and Americans, but not to the Russians. Dodge was asked to undertake this task because of his relationship to Winston Churchill\n\nHe returned to Britain, after traveling to Dresden, where he survived the RAF Air Raid on 14 February, then Munich before crossing the border into Switzerland. He arrived in Britain in May 1945 and met Churchill and the US ambassador to Britain, John Gilbert Winant on 6 May 1945. He explained his adventures and the German peace proposal. History records the offer was not accepted.\n\nDodge was awarded the Military Cross for his services as a POW, this being recorded in the London Gazette on 18 April 1946.\n\nPost-war Dodge was a central figure leading the war crimes investigation to bring key Gestapo and other officials to justice who were responsible for carrying out the orders to murder 50 of the 76 escapees from Stalag Luft III.\n\nHe attempted to restart his political career, but with no success, when he stood at Gillingham at the 1945 General Election but lost narrowly to the winning Labour member, Joseph Binns.\n\nHe died, aged 66, of a heart attack when hailing a taxi near Hyde Park in London in November 1960. After cremation his ashes were buried at St Andrew's Church, Ferring, Sussex.\n\nDodge has been portrayed by Christopher Reeve in the made-for-TV film \"\" (1988).\n"}

{"id": "20938512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20938512", "title": "Mass finishing", "text": "Mass finishing\n\nMass finishing is a group of manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10 minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2 hours for hardened steel.\n\nMass finishing processes can be configured as either batch systems, in which batches of workpieces are added, run, and removed before the next batch is run, or as continuous systems, in which the workpieces enter at one end and leave at the other end in the finished state. They may also be sequenced, which involves running the workpieces through multiple different mass finishing processes; usually, the finish becomes progressively finer. Due to the random action of the processes, mass finishing is as much an art as it is a science.\n\nMedia are designed for four things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds are added to mass finishing processes to assist in deburring, burnishing, cutting, cleaning, descaling, and inhibiting corrosion. They may be liquids or dry powders. They are usually broken up into four types: deburring and finishing, burnishing, cleaning, and water stabilizing.\n\n\n\"Mass Finishing Handbook\" by LaRoux Gillespie, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, 2007\n"}

Its president is Richard B. Spencer, and its executive director (since July 27, 2017) is Evan McLaren.\n\nNPI was founded in 2005 by William Regnery II. Louis R. Andrews was the chairman until 2010. Andrews said that he had voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election because \"I want to see the Republican Party destroyed, so it can be reborn as a party representing the interests of white people, and not entrenched corporate elites.\" When Andrews died in 2011, he was replaced by Richard B. Spencer. According to George Hawley, an assistant professor of Political Science at the University of Alabama, NPI was \"rather obscure and marginalized\" until Spencer became its president in 2011, at which point Spencer's website, AlternativeRight.com, became an NPI initiative.\n\nThe group was based in Augusta, Georgia, at its founding, but by 2013 had relocated to Montana. Spencer divides his time between Montana and Virginia; in 2016, the group was based in Arlington, Virginia. By early 2017, the NPI had leased a townhouse office space on King Street in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, where it maintains its headquarters today. City leaders in Arlington and Alexandria acknowledged the NPI's right to operate, but denounced the group's views. The group's presence in Alexandria has prompted several protests.\n\nIn December 2013, NPI launched a website, \"Radix Journal\", which describes itself as \"a periodical on culture, race, meta-politics, critical theory, and society\". The NPI received a grant from the Pioneer Fund, a racist pseudo-scientific organization.\n\nIn 2016, Twitter suspended the accounts of the NPI, its leader Richard Spencer and others under its terms of use. Spencer said that \"digitally speaking, there has been execution squads across the alt-right\" and accused Twitter of \"corporate Stalinism\". However, Twitter's suspension was not based on the content of Spencer's posts, but rather on Twitter's rule barring multiple accounts with overlapping uses. Spencer's personal Twitter account was reinstated several weeks later; the NPI's remained suspended.\n\nSpencer was the headline speaker at a 2016 NPI conference held in Washington, D.C., and celebrated the election of Donald Trump as \"the first step towards identity politics in the United States\", and \"the victory of will\" (a reference to a Nazi propaganda film). Spencer \"railed against Jews and, with a smile, quoted Nazi propaganda in the original German\". Spencer finished his speech by yelling \"Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\" as audience members responded by standing up and making the Nazi salute. The United States Holocaust Museum issued a statement condemning the \"hateful rhetoric\" of the conference. Other speakers included Scotland-based YouTuber Millennial Woes.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, NPI \"raised $442,482 in tax-deductible contributions from 2007 through 2012\". \n\nNPI's tax-exempt status was revoked in 2017 by the Internal Revenue Service for failing to file tax returns. The group had not filed a Form 990 since 2013. In March 2017, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS), which regulates the operation of charities in Virginia, removed the NPI's entry from its public database of nonprofits and announced that it was reviewing the group's status. The NPI raised $50,000 in late 2016 and early 2017 from an online fundraising drive and has solicited donations to be sent to its Arlington, Virginia post office box, but in February 2017 VDACS had listed the group as \"not authorized to solicit in Virginia.\"\n\nNPI's website says that \"the dispossession of White Americans will have catastrophic effects for the entire world, not just for our people\". The organization has produced a series of reports on affirmative action, race and conservatism, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and a report edited by VDARE contributor Nicholas Stix, \"The State of White America – 2007\". Stix's introduction to the report said it gave \"a statistical and narrative portrait of the war on white America\" and described the Supreme Court's 1954 \"Brown v. Board of Education\" ruling outlawing school segregation as \"arguably the worst decision in the Court's 216-year history\".\n\nThe NPI has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as a white supremacist organization. Marilyn Mayo, the co-director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, said that the group \"basically was founded to be kind of a white supremacist think tank\".\n\nThe NPI is regarded as part of a group of white nationalist organizations that, according to \"The New York Times\", \"try to take a more highbrow approach, couching white nationalist arguments as academic commentary on black inferiority, the immigration threat to whites and other racial issues.\" Other groups that advance similar strategies include the New Century Foundation (and its publication \"American Renaissance\",) the Charles Martel Society (and its website the \"Occidental Observer\"), and the Pioneer Fund, all of which have been described by the SPLC as playing leading roles in the promotion of \"academic racism\".\n\n"}

Through this parental relationship Nikarete sought to increase the price her customers had to pay (free women were usually higher in demand). Nikarete's most famous hetaera was Neaira, whom she bought along with six other girls and treated them as her own. There is a possibility that Nikarete was not a single individual or even a real person. The name \"Nikarete\" has either been attributed to artistic interpretation or to an error in referring to different individuals (Neaira or Nicarete of Megara).\n\nIn Tom Holland's book \"Persian Fire\" he states: korinthiazein - 'to do a Corinthian' - means to fuck. \n\nIn Aristophanes \"Wealth\" Chremylus says \"They say that in Corinth the tarts there, when a customer come's in who's poor, they just ignore him, but a rich man gets instant admission - even by the back entrance!\" \n"}

He trained as a carpenter and started making wooden toys in 1932 to make a living after having lost his job during the Great Depression. Soon after, his wife Kirstine died, leaving him to raise his four sons. Christiansen was inspired to construct a small wooden duck toy for his children. He never remarried. He soon learned his sons loved the new toy and decided to put the ducks into production, using the leftover wood from his old business.\n\nIn 1942, a fire broke out at the factory, forcing them to rebuild. Initially, he made miniature versions of the houses and furniture as he worked on as a carpenter, but in 1947 moved to using plastics, which were originally small plastic bears and rattles. By 1949 he had produced over 200 plastic and wooden toys.\n\nOle wanted a name for the group. In 1934 he launched a competition to name the company. The prize was a bottle of his own homemade wine.

Most activities that require licensure also have penalties for practicing without a valid, current license. In some jurisdictions, a license is offered but not required for some professions.\n\nFields where practicing without a license may carry civil or criminal penalties include lawyer, physician, physician assistant, optometrist, podiatrist, surgeon, coroner, medical examiner, paramedic, funeral director, osteopath, chiropractor, dentist, pharmacist, engineer, pilot, broadcasting, nurse, veterinarian, midwife, teacher, psychologist, surveyor, detective, social worker, architect, barber, hairdresser, electrologist, tattooist, cosmetologist, real estate agent, plumber, florist, accountant, and masseuse. If a person offering their services is licensed in one of these professions, any member of the public has a right to know if that person is validly licensed or not by the licensing authority. Anyone who claims to have a license and refuses to identify themselves properly by first and last name can possibly lose any one or all of their licenses. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal for service providers to hide their identities for purposes of making it difficult to verify licensure and past disciplinary actions or license violations.\n\nLicense requirements vary widely with jurisdiction, sometimes even within a single country. Practicing a professional discipline without a license may be legal in some jurisdictions. For example, nine U.S. states have passed health freedom laws that protect alternative practitioners such as herbalists from prosecution for \"practicing medicine without a license.\" In the area of mental health, Oregon offers broad licensing exemptions for professional counselors and marriage and family therapists, allowing people to practice these professions either with or without a license. Colorado requires registration but not licensing for psychotherapists. Other states also have exemptions or registration requirements instead of, or in addition to licensing for some professions.\n\nOther occupations, such as operating a business or working as a professional driver or mariner, may require specialized licensure as well. Operating a business without proper licenses can result in financial and sometimes criminal penalties. These licenses can include a general business license, a liquor license, a specialized drivers license, and other types regulated by local, regional, state, or federal requirements. Certain occupations may require obtaining appropriate intellectual property licenses, such as music licensing, brand licensing, patent licensing, software licensing, and other permissions for use.\n\nNon-professional activities may also require licenses for participation. These include driver's license, amateur radio license, dog license, firearms license, hunting license, marriage license, pilot license. Using certain products or services may also require obtaining a license, such as a software license. Operating without these licenses can lead to civil and criminal penalties.\n\nPenalties vary depending on the severity of the infraction, but practicing without a valid, current license may be punishable by one or more methods, including community service, fine, restitution, probation and temporary or permanent loss of the license. Criminal charges can lead to incarceration, as they can range from a misdemeanor to a felony, depending on the severity of the infraction.\n\nOn July 6, 1885, Louis Pasteur, a chemist who was a pioneer in microbiology, treated Joseph Meister after the boy was mauled by a dog infected with rabies with a vaccination treatment that had thus far only been tested on animals. This was technically illegal considering Pasteur was not a licensed physician, but he and his colleagues agreed that it was necessary considering his treatment seemed the only way to save the boy from a likely death. the treatment was successful, Pasteur was feted as a hero, and charges were never filed.\n\nAnother more modern example is the case of Frank Abagnale, who was accused of impersonating an airline pilot, lawyer, and teaching assistant.\n\nThe \"yogurt defense\" was made famous by the trial of Carol Downer, one of the developers of menstrual extraction. She was arrested at her self-help group and charged with practicing medicine without a license, as she inserted yogurt into the vagina of another woman to treat a yeast condition. Carol Downer was acquitted; the jury did not equate inserting yogurt with practicing medicine.\n\nBlack Jack is a Japanese comic book series created by Tezuka Osamu that is about the world's greatest surgeon, who chooses to remain unlicensed. This allows Black Jack to charge extortionate amounts of money instead of the standard fees agreed upon by the Japanese Medical Association. It also lets him perform extremely dangerous, often medically implausible or impossible operations, that are not legally allowed. Black Jack is often viewed as the Japanese equivalent to Batman, in his willingness to routinely break laws to save lives for which he is frequently imprisoned by the police. It is notable that Black Jack actually completed his college medical education and carries a driver's license, though he encourages other unlicensed doctors who have no such formal training. Like many of Osamu's works, Black Jack is extraordinarily critical of the medical establishment, and is notable for raising Japanese public awareness of medical corruption.\n\nThe majority of superheroes in comic books investigate crimes without detectives' licenses. In Detective Comics, The Question, Dick Grayson, Detective Chimp John Constantine and John Jones/Martian Manhunter are all licensed detectives or police officers, while Wally West, the third Flash is a professional crime scene investigator. Jonah Hex is a bounty hunter operating under the loose legal framework of the wild west. The Green Lantern Corps patrol the D.C. universe and enforce the ancient intergalactic laws of the guardians of Oa. In Marvel Comics, Frank Castle used to be a policeman, but after his wife and child were shot to death, he left the force forever and became the mass murdering vigilante The Punisher.\n\nBatman is one of only three members of the Justice League with any medical training but is the only one who lacks an official doctorate and license to practice medicine. Nevertheless, he occasionally performs surgery on his teammates despite being the son of the doctor Thomas Wayne. In Marvel Comics, the former neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, in desperate search of a cure for his crippled hands, wasted all of his money on alternative medicine, which did not heal him. Homeless, Doctor Strange performed back alley surgeries for cash, barely able to hold the instruments.\n\nVictor Frankenstein, though often incorrectly referred to as a doctor, is only a medical student, and as such operated on his monster without a license. Prior to the monster's vivification, Frankenstein and his assistant Igor were also acting as unlicensed morticians.\n\nThe movie Patch Adams, among other historical inaccuracies, showed the title character practicing medicine without a license, and getting his equipment by stealing from a hospital.\n\nThe USA Network drama \"Suits\"' protagonist, Michael \"Mike\" Ross, gets a high-flying job at the fictitious Pearson Hardman law firm without having the necessary license to practice law.\n\n"}

{"id": "33126504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33126504", "title": "Sinter plant", "text": "Sinter plant\n\nSinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines (dust) with other fine materials at high temperature, to create a product that can be used in a blast furnace. The final product, a sinter, is a small, irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals. The process, called sintering, causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single porous mass with little change in the chemical properties of the ingredients. The purpose of sinter are to be used converting iron into steel.\n\nSinter plants, in combination with blast furnaces, are also used in non-ferrous smelting. About 70% of the world's primary lead production is still produced using the sinter plant–blast furnace combination, and this combination was formerly often used in copper smelting (at the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting smelter in Wollongong, New South Wales, for example).\n\nMany countries, including India, France and Germany, have underground deposits of iron ore in dust form (blue dust). Such iron ore cannot be directly charged in a blast furnace. In the early 20th century, sinter technology was developed for converting ore fines into lumpy material chargeable in blast furnaces. Sinter technology took 30 years to gain acceptance in the iron-making domain, but now plays an important role. Initially developed to generate steel, it is now a means of using metallurgical waste generated in steel plants to enhance blast furnace operation and reducing waste. The largest sinter plant is located in Chennai, India, and employs 10,000 people.\nMain feed into a sinter plant is base mix, which consists of iron ore fines, coke fines and flux (lime stone) fines. In addition to base mix, coke fines, flux fines, sinter fines, iron dust (collected from plant de-dusting system & ESP) and plant waste are mixed in proportion (by weight) in a rotary drum, often called mixing and nodulizing drum. Calcined lime is used as binder of the mixed material along with water (all in particular proportion by weight) to form feed-sinter of about 5 to 7 mm in size. This sinter globules are fed to sintering machine and burnt there-in to produce blast furnace feed sinter.\n\nMaterial is put on a sinter machine in two layers. The bottom layer may vary in thickness from . A 12 to 20 mm sinter fraction is used, also referred to as the hearth layer. The second, covering layer consists of mixed materials, making for a total bed height of . The mixed materials are applied with drum feeders and roll feeders, which distributes the nodules in certain depth throughout the sinterring machine . The upper layer is smoothed using a leveler. The material, also known as a charge, enters the ignition furnace into rows of multi-slit burners. In the case of one plant, the first (ignition) zone has eleven burners. The next (soaking/annealing) zone typically offers 12 burners. Air is sucked from the bottom of the bed of mixed material throughout the sintering machine. Fire penetrates the mixed material gradually, until it reaches the hearth layer. This end point of burning is called burn through point (BTP). The hearth layer, which is nothing but sinter in smaller size, restricts sticking of hot sinter with pallets. BTP is achieved in a certain zone of sinter machine, to optimize the process, by means of several temperature measuring instrument placed throughout the sinter machine. After completion of burning, the mix converts into sinter, which then breaks into smaller size by sinter breaker. After breaking into small sizes, it cools down in cooler (linear or circular) by means of forced air. At discharge of sinter cooler, temperature of sinter is maintained as low, so that the hot sinter can be transported by a conveyor belt made of rubber. Necessary precautions are taken to trace any existence of fire in the belt and necessary extinguishing is done by spraying water. Then this product is being passed through a jaw-crusher, where the size of sinter is further reduced (~ 50 mm) into smaller size. Then the complete mixture is being passed through two screens. Smallest sinter fines (< 5 mm) are stored in proportioning bins and reused for preparing sinter again through mixing and nodulizing drum and fed to sinter machine for burning. A part of the smaller one ( 5 - 20 mm) is used for hearth layer in sinter machine and the rest is taken to the blast furnace along with the biggest sized sinters. \n\nThe temperature is typically maintained between in the ignition zone and between 900 and 1000 °C in the soaking zone to prevent sudden quenching of the sintered layer. The top 5 mm from screens goes to the conveyor carrying the sinter for the blast furnace and, along with blast furnace grade sinter, either goes to sinter storage bunkers or to BF bunkers. Blast furnace-grade sinter consists of particles sized 5 to 12 mm as well as 20 mm and above.\n\nThere are certain advantages of using sinters as opposed to using other materials which include recycling the fines and other waste products, to include flue dust, mill scale, lime dust and sludge. Processing sinter helps eliminate raw flux, which is a binding material used to agglomerate materials, which saves the heating material, coke, and improves furnace productivity. \n\nImprovements and efficiency can be gained from higher softening temperature and narrower softening in the melting zone, which increases the volume of the granular zone and shrinks the width of the cohesive zone. A lower silica content and higher hot metal temperature contributes to more sulphur removal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5761884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5761884", "title": "TerraCycle", "text": "TerraCycle\n\nTerraCycle is a private U.S. recycling business headquartered in Trenton, New Jersey. It runs a volunteer-based curbside collection program to collect non-recyclable pre-consumer and post-consumer waste, and then partners with corporate donors to turn it into raw material to be used in new products. The company licenses its name to manufacturers of roughly 200 products made using its raw material.\n\nTerraCycle was founded by Tom Szaky and Jon Beyer in the fall of 2001. In 2002, the company bought a US$20,000 continuous-flow composting system invented by Harry Windle of Gainesville, Florida, to take organic waste and have it processed by worms into fertilizer. The dining halls of Princeton University was the first source of waste used.\n\nInitial funding came from family and friends of Tom Szaky and Jon Beyer, as well as awards from business plan competitions. TerraCycle received media attention when it turned down a one million dollar venture investment opportunity awarded through the Carrot Capital Business Plan because the investors planned to change TerraCycle's business model. Further funding came from private investors. The first investor was Suman Sinha, who gave $2,000 in exchange for 1% of the company stock.\n\nInstead of pure fertilizer, TerraCycle sold its products in liquid form. The company made this decision upon concluding that liquid fertilizer could have better consumer reception, as well as production advantages. The original purpose for packing its liquid fertilizer in used plastic bottles was because the company could not afford new ones. Later, the company continued this process and marketed their gardening products as \"Waste in Waste\". Schools and local organizations collected bottles for TerraCycle in exchange for proceeds in what became known as the \"Bottle Brigade\".\n\nMaintaining intellectual property rights, The Coca-Cola Company gave TerraCycle a license to use its bottles in TerraCycle products. PepsiCo also gave TerraCycle a license to use its distinctively shaped bottles.\n\nIn 2004–5, Home Depot Canada and Wal-Mart Canada began carrying TerraCycle products. Other companies followed. During its growth, the company bought an abandoned mansion to house its interns and a warehouse for its fertilizer production and offices.\n\nThe Scotts Miracle-Gro Company sued TerraCycle in 2007, claiming false advertising and trade dress violations. In response, TerraCycle started a media campaign known as \"suedbyscotts.com\". Scotts claimed that TerraCycle's choice of colors was too similar to its own products. Scotts eventually dropped the case upon an agreement with TerraCycle to alter TerraCycle's product packaging. TerraCycle agreed to recolor its packaging to orange and green as well as remove pictures of fruits and vegetables on its labels. Issues over product comparison claims on TerraCycle's packaging were also resolved. In the settlement, Scotts required TerraCycle to host a copy of the agreement on suedbyscotts.com.\n\nIn 2007, TerraCycle developed waste solutions and Brigade collection programs for Honest Tea, Stonyfield Farm, and Kraft Foods. Seth Goldman, founder and CEO of Honest Tea, asked Szaky for a waste solution to its Honest Kids brand. As Tom Szaky himself designed sample products for the aluminum-plastic pouches, including pencil pouches and tote bags, Goldman agreed to sponsor the Drink Pouch Brigade. Upon deals with Safeway, Target, and Walgreens to buy the products, TerraCycle acquired approximately 20 million baled juice pouches stored by Encorp in British Columbia, Canada, which contained many Capri-Sun pouches. Because of intellectual property and trademark rights, TerraCycle sought out permission from Kraft to use Capri-Sun brand pouches in its products. They obtained additional sponsorship for the Drink Pouch Brigade as well. Programs for other Kraft brands, such as Oreo and Chips Ahoy, soon followed. The same year, co-founder Jon Beyer left TerraCycle to work at another company, Princeton Asset Management Group.\n\nIn 2008, TerraCycle partnered with Target to sell recycled Target plastic shopping bags fused together as reusable bags named \"reTotes\". At the end of the year, TerraCycle lost $4.5 million. As a result, the company changed its manufacturing processes to use pre-consumer extra and misprinted packaging labels from other companies in its upcycled products. TerraCycle changed to use the majority of its collected post-consumer waste for recycling into plastic molding pellets. Around 2008, it ended its Bottle Brigade program.\n\nBy 2009, TerraCycle moved away from manufacturing to licensing all of its products. As of the same year, it outsourced its vermicompost production to worm farmers in North Carolina.\n\nFrom 2012, TerraCycle and various tobacco companies partnered to launch a widespread collection and recycling system for cigarette butts. The cigarette filters, generally made from cellulose acetate, are refined into pellets that are then used in the production of plastic items such as shipping pallets, benches, and ashtrays. The company promises that the recycled plastic from cigarette filters will only be used in industrial products and not in household plastics, due to exposure to nicotine. The recycled cellulose acetate is mixed with other recycled plastics to create usable industrial products. Tobacco and paper are composted in this program. It took six months for the development of the process required to recycle cigarette butts.\n\nOn January 29, 2014, Progressive Waste Solutions announced a 19.99% interest acquisition in TerraCycle Canada to cooperate on recycling initiatives in Canada.\n\nIn October 2016, TerraCycle and Suez Environment announced that Suez acquired 30% of TerraCycle’s European operations to develop collection and recycling programs in Europe. At the World Economic Forum in January 2017, TerraCycle, Procter & Gamble and Suez announced production of the world's first recyclable shampoo bottle made from plastic recovered from beaches, rivers and waterways for the Head & Shoulders brand. The first bottles went on sale in France in June 2017 and in October the project was recognized by the United Nations as a winner of a Momentum For Change Lighthouse Activities Award.\n\nTerraCycle has created approximately 200 products, all of which are licensed to manufacturers, instead of being manufactured by TerraCycle itself.\n\nTerraCycle began with the production of fertilizer made from vermicompost, which is produced by feeding organic waste to worms. The worms' excrement was then liquefied into \"compost tea\" by mixing it with air and warm water in large vats. It was packaged in reused plastic water bottles. The spray bottle tops were rejects from other companies. Residue left over from the vats was used in potting soil and seed starter products.\nThe company diversified its production into upcycling around 2007 and began creating products from other waste items. For example, it makes coin pouches and tablet cases from retired U.S. Postal Service bags. Various products are produced from pre-consumer waste and post-consumer waste, including messenger and tote bags.\n\nPlastic packaging waste, that is not upcycled, is recycled into a raw material that can be used in plastic products, including playgrounds, plastic lumber, plastic pavers, bike racks, park benches, and garbage and recycling cans.\n\nTerraCycle's recycling programs enable individuals or groups to collect specified waste materials in exchange for donations to a selected cause or school. Users sign up over the Internet, and shipping and donation costs are generally covered by a sponsoring company related to the specified recycling program. The waste materials, typically non-recyclable, are either refurbished, upcycled, or recycled.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in 2019, TerraCycle plans to unveil Loop, a closed-loop reusable packaging platform for consumer packaged goods companies.\n\nTerraCycle has also been accused of \"greenwashing\" (marketing with a false promise of eco-friendliness). One perceived problem is the missing incentive for companies to stop using non-recyclable packaging, since TerraCycle takes on the waste for free, whereas the companies would have had to pay for dumping it. This also discourages approaches of making companies fiscally responsible for their waste, similar to European extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws. TerraCycle spokesman, Albe Zakes, has said that the company thinks of itself as \"a privatized version of EPR laws\".\n\nTerraCycle also keeps the branding prominent on their recycled products. This has raised concern that consumers could think of the brands themselves as \"green\" or \"eco-friendly\" while the product is probably only \"upcyclable\", not fully recyclable. TerraCycle products are not recyclable any further.\n\nTerraCycle has been criticized by some people for the relatively small volume of material it collects for recycling in comparison to the total amount of such packaging that is produced by manufacturers each year, while noting that in the US, after over 40 years of regulations requiring recycling of materials (glass, paper, rigid plastic and certain metals), recycling rates are under 35% where recycling is economically viable.\n\nAccording to Tom Szaky, the name TerraCycle \"came up at the beginning [as] the idea of 'earth' and 'cycle'.\" Szaky thought up the name with another Princeton University student during a road trip from New Jersey to Florida. The TerraCycle company logo is a green infinity symbol with two arrows pointed toward one another.

{"id": "38012052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38012052", "title": "Tor Nessling", "text": "Tor Nessling\n\nTor Ragnar Nessling MSc \"(diplomi-insinööri)\" (6 September 1901 – 23 November 1971) was a leading Finnish industrialist, entrepreneur and engineer. For nearly four decades he was the general manager of the Finnish heavy vehicle producer Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT). His contribution to national development was officially recognized by the Finnish President who appointed Nessling as a \"Vuorineuvos\".\n\nNessling became head of SAT in 1932, soon after the company's foundation. He developed the business in an era when only few believed in the possibility of a Finnish automotive industry, and a decade later had become the company's majority shareholder. Nessling took a patriarchal approach to his leadership of the company, which he built into a producer of trucks, bus chassis, rail vehicles and specialist terminal tractors. Nessling lost his controlling shareholding following a merger in 1968, resigned in 1970 and died the following year.\n\nNessling's parents were engineer John Nessling and Greta née Grönholm. Nessling did his abitur at the Helsinki coeducational (Swedish language) in 1920. He continued his studies at the Mechanical Engineering Faculty of the Helsinki University of Technology: simultaneously he studied Geology at the University of Helsinki between 1922 and 1924. Nessling graduated as a diplomi-insinööri in 1924. He traveled in Sweden, the UK, Germany and the USA, and between 1926 and 1928 Nessling worked successively for three Finnish automobile import companies Korpivaara & Halla, Henry-Auto and Auto-Bil. He worked as manager in the auto-business with Munkkisaaren Autotalli ja Konepaja from 1928 to 1929 and then with Autovarikko between 1929 and 1930.\n\nIn 1929 Nessling was appointed Technical Manager of the bus and coach builder Autoteollisuus-Bilindustri. Nessling wanted to develop a new branch of industry for his country and in the same year he became interested in starting a lorry and bus industry in Finland. Autoteollisuus–Bilindustri put together its activities with another coachbuilder Osakeyhtiö Autokoritehdas in 1931. The name of the new company was Suomen Autoteollisuus (\"Finnish Auto-industry\") and its first General Manager was John Hellsten. It is often claimed that Nessling was a founder of SAT: he was not. The operation was organised by Karl Arthur Nordgrén, Emil Anton Winckelmann and Lars Wilhelm Åberg. However, the year after the company's creation Nessling was appointed General Manager of the SAT.\nStarting a vehicle construction business virtually from scratch in the middle of a recession seemed impossible, but under Nessling's determined leadership that is what was achieved. The vehicle brand selected was \"Sisu\", and the first 12 Sisu vehicles rolled out from the factory in 1932. Although the level of domestic content was just 20% at the beginning Nessling was determined to increase this substantially. Famously, he liked to say : \"A Finn is capable of making anything which a foreigner can make.\" By the end of the 1930s Sisu vehicles contained 40% local content. Nessling strongly lobbied the Finnish government about the growth potential of automotive industry, stressing the employment potential and also the strategic significance of Finnish controlled vehicle production for national defence. However, the government ignored his arguments and progressively cut the import tariffs on heavy vehicles during the 1930s, making competition for the domestic industry more intense. In addition, some of the owners of SAT began to doubt the prospects for domestic heavy vehicle production. Nessling offered to buy from Helsingin Osakepankki its shares in SAT in 1938. He obtained the shares cheaply, but to finance the bargain he nevertheless had to pledge his wife's entire property. Eventually, Nessling ended up owning 80% of SAT.\n\nThe Second World War brought new challenges to SAT because many foreign components became unobtainable. The degree of domestic content could be increased to 90%, though only with much effort. A big step forward came with the start of American Hercules engine production under licence. Principle customers for SAT during the war were the Finnish Defence Forces and other government institutions. SAT started building a new factory in Karis, where it would be less vulnerable to Soviet air raids than Helsinki. The production capacity was not adequate to meet the demand; in 1942 the Defence Forces estimated that they would need 7,000 lorries and buses in the next few years. Nessling suggested building the Karis factory larger than had originally been planned. However, SAT's economic and technical resources were limited, and influential heavy vehicle importers, supported by some political factions, suspected that SAT was exploiting the war to benefit unfairly and gain a dominant position in the Finnish market. The government suggested an arrangement in which SAT would have become partly state owned. Nessling ruled this option out, however: he did not want the state to be involved in SAT. The fall-back option was creation of another company with support of the state and some significant Finnish companies. Such a company, Yhteissisu, was formed in 1943 and Tor Nessling, most reluctantly, found himself installed its General Manager. Yhteissisu started building Sisu lorries in Vanaja, some 100 km (63 miles) to the north of Helsinki. But war gave way to peace before Yhteissisu's capability to build military trucks had come fully on stream. Nessling left his post with Yhteissisu in 1946, complaining of lack of support from the company owners. Yhteissisu lorry production was redirected to the civilian market, and in 1948 the company was renamed \"Vanajan Autotehdas\" (VAT).\n\nBy now Nessling was becoming increasingly embittered with the Finnish government. First his ideas about domestic heavy vehicle production were ignored in the 1930s, and then the government had forced through the creation of a powerful competitor which had established itself by using technology developed by Nessling's company. Disenchantment with the politicians was in evidence when the government offered Nessling beneficial funding opportunities in the 1960s: he replied that he had never requested, and would never ask for anything from the government.\n\nProduction of SAT grew strongly in the 1950s and 1960s; the volumes quadrupled to 800 vehicles per year during the 1950s. In addition to producing lorries and bus chassis, the company provided trams and rail vehicles to the Finnish State Railways. SAT products were exported to four continents. The growing volumes both required and benefited from investment in production facilities and sales and marketing campaigns. Unlike many contemporary industrialists, Nessling valued marketing, and he focused closely on identifying, understanding and satisfying customer needs.\n\nSAT's leading domestic competitor, Vanajan Autotehdas, was in financial trouble by end of the 1960s. Nessling proposed a merger between Vanajan Autotehdas and SAT because he was afraid that a foreign competitor, such as Volvo or Scania, would otherwise take over Vanajan Autotehdas. The companies came together in 1968. In the end, the merger led to a situation that Nessling had wanted to avoid: the state became a part-owner of the new SAT with a 17% shareholding and Nessling lost his controlling majority as his own holding fell to below 50%. SAT acquired an executive board of directors and a supervisory board. Although Nessling was still the company's principal shareholder, his influence was diminished: he had very little recent experience of receiving orders or of operating with a board of directors, and he found adapting to the new situation difficult.\n\nRelations between Nessling and the board got worse when Nessling fell ill: he recovered, but not sufficiently to be able to work as before, although he was keen to continue with his role in the company management. The board was not convinced and reorganised the company structure. Nessling resisted the transfer of marketing responsibilities to other hands but could not prevent it. Nessling's old business partner and friend, then head of British Leyland Motor Corporation, Lord Stokes, whom Nessling greatly respected, eventually persuaded him to step aside. Tor Nessling announced his resignation as General Manager of Suomen Autoteollisuus in June 1970, after leading the company for nearly four decades. Erik Gillberg was appointed the new General Manager in February 1971.\n\nNessling worked hard and shunned the limelight. He worked closely with a small number of trusted colleagues, but many colleagues and underlings remembered his leadership style as patriarchal and distant. He resisted delegating decisions. He is described as a brilliant businessman who had the ability to spot business opportunities, but he was also a quick tempered, and was found by some to be excessively risk-averse. The tough industrialist also had his softer side: he liked nature and animals, and he kept many pets at his home.\n\nNessling had married in 1926 Greta Maria \"Maj\" (née Kock) who stayed home as a housewife while supporting her husband in his career. The marriage was childless, and when Nessling died in 1971 his widow sold the family share in SAT. In 1972 she bequeathed their property to establish the Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation. The foundation is a significant funder of environmental research in Finland.\n\n"}

Following the implementation, no new YKs were allowed in Japan, but pre-existing YKs were allowed to continue their operations as kabushiki gaisha under special rules.\n\nWhether the term is pronounced as \"yūgen gaisha\" or \"yūgen kaisha\" is up to the local dialect or the company's preference when it is part of the company's name.

The members were required to provide at least ¥3 million in capital contributions, with each valued at no less than ¥50,000.

In addition to simplified corporate governance, a Y.K. receives some tax benefits under foreign laws such as the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.\n"}
