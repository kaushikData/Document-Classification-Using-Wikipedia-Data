The family rose due to intermarriage with Maltese nobility.\n\nCassar-Torreggiani received his education from St. Ignatius College in St. Julian's before serving for a short period in the Royal Regal Ruler Army during World War I as a member of the Food Control Board.\n\nFor many years, Cassar-Torreggiani was head of the Cassar Company Ltd, which owned St Georges's Flour Mills at Marsa in Malta. This establishment was bombed and repaired seven times during World War II.\n\nCassar-Torreggiani was prominent as a banker, serving on the boards of the Banco di Malta and the Anglo-Maltese Bank. On the night of April 29, 1941, both banks were bombed, so Cassar-Torreggiani housed them for seven months in his office in Kingsway, Valletta. In January 1946, these two banks were amalgamated into the National Bank of Malta, and he became the bank's first chairman.\n\nCassar-Torreggiani was considered a philanthropist. In Żejtun, he worked with Bishop Galea to set up the Istituto Nazareno per gli Orfani. In the annals of Maltese sport he is remembered as the creator of one of Malta's most prestigious football competition, the Cassar Cup, proceeds from which were annually directed to local charities. Nearly Lm50,000 were donated during its first thirty years.\n\nAn unpublished letter revealed that in 1919 during the Sette Giugno riots, Cassar-Torreggiani's flour mills and home were overrun by rioters. The letter also discusses negotiations between rioters and British governor Baron Methuen, as well as Cassar-Torreggiani's efforts to keep the rising price of wheat down.\n\nBetween 1924–26, Cassar-Torreggiani served as one of the two representatives of the Chamber of Commerce in the Senate. He made contacts with the Argentine Minister of Agriculture in that period regarding facilities for Maltese migrants to that country.\n\nHe was active in the Chamber of Commerce. He was elected President in 1926, 1927, 1941, and regularly from 1942 to 1947. In 1948, he was elected Honorary President for Life.\n\nHe was survived by two sons and two daughters. \n\n"}

This could include lighting, blinds, cinema rooms.\n\nThe professional audiovisual industry is a multibillion-dollar industry, comprising the manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, consultants, programmers, presentations professionals and technology managers of audiovisual products and services.\n\nCommercial audiovisual can sometimes be a very lengthy process to get it right. Boardroom audio visual can be installed for a number of reasons, but usually it is because the executives of the organization/business wants to have meetings with colleagues/customers/suppliers around the world. When creating an array of boardrooms for customers it has been seen that you have to be able to balance the pattern from the audio and microphone so there is no interruption in the sound quality for the individual/s listening in.\n\nThe proliferation of audiovisual communications technologies, including sound, video, lighting, display and projection systems, is evident in every sector of society: in business, education, government, the military, healthcare, retail environments, worship, sports and entertainment, hospitality, restaurants, and museums. The application of audiovisual systems is found in collaborative conferencing (which includes video-conferencing, audio-conferencing, web-conferencing and data-conferencing); presentation rooms, auditoriums, and lecture halls; command and control centers; digital signage, and more. Concerts and corporate events are among the most obvious venues where audiovisual equipment is used in a staged environment. Providers of this type of service are known as rental and staging companies, although they may also be served by an in-house technology team (e.g., in a hotel or conference center).\n\nAccording to a 2006 market forecast study by InfoComm International, a leading trade association representing the audiovisual industry, 2006 was the fourth consecutive year that significant growth was projected for the industry. Revenue for surveyed North American companies was expected to grow by 40% in 2006, and by 10.7% for European audiovisual companies. The single biggest factor for this increase is the increased demand for networked audiovisual products due to the integration of audiovisual and IT technology. The two leading markets for AV equipment in North America and Europe continue to be business/IT and education, especially as conference room technologies become more advanced.\n\nAudiovisual education is instruction where particular attention is paid to the audio and visual presentation of the material, with the goal of improving comprehension and retention.\n\n"}

{"id": "27978221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27978221", "title": "Business chess", "text": "Business chess\n\nBusiness chess is a variant of chess played in teams. It was invented in 1992 by Dr. Grachya Ovakimyan of Moscow with the aim of making chess more entertaining and spectacular.\n\nIn the opinion of the inventor, free and open discussion between team members and collective decision-making process may make the game spectacular by increasing its dynamism and presenting the various stages of chess players' thinking, evaluation of positions, calculation of variants, choice of alternatives, and so on. In turn, in order to ensure active team discussion and effective decision-making process the \"Interactive Cognitive Scenario\" was developed.\n\nOvakimyan describes this version of chess as a sports business game.\n\n\nThe board, pieces, their positions and rules of movement are the same as for standard chess. But several parallel branches (versions of the same game) can be played at the same time on the several boards, with the help of rating (importance) indicators of a certain branch (red marks on top of the board, see Photo 2). The game is for two teams, recommended each to have five members. During the game members of one team may discuss it, as well as actively move, and then form the alternative (parallel) branches. They also can change the rating of each branch by transferring its marks. With the possibility of changing the number of simultaneously played branches and their ratings, qualitatively new, tactical and strategic methods of competition appear which are inherent only in this version of chess.\n\nIn the Interactive Cognitive Scenario the following mechanisms are envisaged: (Photo 1 and Figure 1):\n\nParallel variants of a game (branches) can be played on five nearby demonstration boards, numbered 1 to 5, each of which has its own rating (See Photo 2). Teams can decide to change the number of branches and their ratings. The score of each branch (on a particular board) is equal to its chess result, multiplied by the rating of the given branch. The final score of the game is equal to the sum of results of all branches.\n\nThe game begins on one demonstration board only, representing branch 1 (see Figure 1) with rating 10. Branching is used (see Figure 2) to increase the number of branches.\n\nTo carry out a Branching the team on its move copies the position from board 1 to a free demonstration board, apply differing continuations (for example, on a demonstration board 1 move e4, and on a board 2 – g3). In this case, the rating of the original (maternal) branch is distributed between the child branches according to the decision made by the team making the branch. As a result of the subsequent branching there will appear branches 3, 4, and 5.\n\nIf in the course of a game one of the teams gets a branch with a lost position (e.g. branch 1 in Figure 3), then the team may resign the game in that branch and transfer all the chips of its rating to the demonstration board of another (parallel) branch, where the team has an undefeated position (e.g. branch 2). This represents the so-called Selection, which offers a team a possibility of winning back what has been lost.\n\nAs a result of such a redistribution, the rating of the lost branch is added to the rating of the remaining one and the opponent gets points equal to the lost branch rating (in the given case, three points).\n\nA Business chess game tree structure resulting from operations of Branching and Selection is shown in Figure 4.\n\nOn Figure 4 the increasing number of branches is shown (after move 7, there are already two branches, after move 11, three, after the move 12, four, and after move 18, five branches). Then, as a result of the selection and drawing (on moves 24, 25, 29 and 37, respectively) the number of branches gradually decreases. After move 37 and until the end of the game there remains only one branch, with a rating of eight.\n\nA very important tactical element of the business chess scenario is chess Passing. Such a pass enables one to transfer, in a single move, one unit of rating from one branch to another without loss of points. It is a way of adjusting branch ratings as the team reassesses their positions. The game tree with Passing has a more complicated form (see Figure 5).\n\nOnly one member of the team may move pieces and ratings on the demonstration board after the team decides collectively. This stops players crowding in front of the demonstration boards. For this purpose the zone before the rows of demonstration boards is separated from the zone of team location by red lines which only one team member may cross.\n\nEach team is provided five ordinary chess boards to freely discuss positions and calculate variants (Figure 1). At each board the team (or part of it) discusses the position arising in one of the branches of a game (Photo 3 and Video). The team itself determines how it organizes discussions and makes decisions. Interactive Cognitive Scenario only suggests the possibility of alternative actions of each team member (using branching) in combination with the possibility of subsequent rejection from them when it becomes clear for team that these actions were erroneous (using selection).\n\nThere is a huge number of possible ways the Interactive Cognitive Scenario can be realized. Therefore, before a game is played some parameters should be agreed:\n\nDuring the game, spectators are able to hear and see team discussions: what information and in what scope the players analyze, how much and what options are offered for continuation, at what depth they are calculated, how the evaluations of positions changes during the passing and what final decisions are taken as a result. For the first time this becomes available for spectators' assessment directly, rather than via expert analysis.\n\nThe demonstration boards show several competing versions of the game (branches). Their number and ratings change throughout the game and directly affect the current and final score of the game.\n\nBusiness chess creates a team spirit and socio-psychological atmosphere that is not specific to chess. It may be of interest even for spectators who do not care much for chess.\n\nPlaying business chess brings out familiar social problems for the teams such as leadership and psychological compatibility, a division of labor and specialization, choosing effective ways of management (authoritarian, democratic, etc.) and problem solving, generating new ideas, their discussion, implementation and development in a competitive environment, and so on.\n\nSpectators can also watch almost all varieties of situations typical in group competition, and their continuous change, depending on the availability or shortage of advantages, time, alternative ways of development, and so on.\n\nTournaments have been held regularly since 1997. Running commentary of one of them was broadcast on Armenian national television.\n\nIn Moscow Russian leading grandmasters participated in two representative tournaments. The first was held in the Central House of Chess by M. M. Botvinnik in 2004, the proceedings of which were broadcast by the \"Sports\" channel of Russian TV. The second was held in the Moscow Chess Club by T. V. Petrosian in 2005.\n\nApart from being a sport, Business Chess can also be used for scientific modelling of mental activity, the processes of problem solving and a choice of strategy, as a general educational business game, method of psychological evaluation, psychological training and play therapy. Such opportunity is conditioned by team active discussion and a multistage process of group decision-making based on sociocultural evolution depending on changing conditions (game). It can be seen that the main mechanisms of Interactive Cognitive Scenario (branching and selection) resemble biological mechanisms of evolution (genetic mutation and natural selection).\n\nBusiness chess as a scientific model can be effectively used for researches in following areas: game theory, bifurcation theory, information theory, control theory and decision theory, the theory of innovation diffusion, management science, sociocultural evolution, cognitive psychology and social psychology, research into natural intelligence and artificial intelligence, and so on. Thus as an expert system the application of existing chess computer programs is possible.\n\nExperts in the field of child psychology agree that the system of national school education must first socialize pupils, that is, accustom and adapt them for the life in social structures. With this purpose it is reasonable to use Business Chess as a general educational business game. The primary goal of similar lessons is to carry out intellectual and socially-psychological trainings for the pupils to make them skilled in constructive communication, communicative competence, efficient management, social self-organization, psychological strength and adaptation in group. It is supposed, that it promotes effective socialization and harmonious development of cogitative (cognitive), behavioral (interactive) and emotional (motivational) components of pupils' personality studying at comprehensive schools.\n\nIt is also reasonable to use Business Chess for carrying out psychological evaluation at schools. The opportunity to register a lot of individual and group psychological parameters at the same time so as to observe their changes in dynamics, allows a complex estimation of intelligence, aptitude, level of achievement, personal situational correlations and mental development. Available expert systems in the form of modern chess computer programs enhance reliability of such researches.\n\nA section of the \"Business Chess\" book is devoted to this subject, and also a lot of popular articles are included in the collection entitled \"Sports business games: Business Chess, Go, Renju and others\", 2007.\n\n"}

ESF spending amounts to around 10% of the EU's total budget.\n\nThe ESF is one of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), which are dedicated to improving social cohesion and economic well-being across the regions of the Union. The funds are redistributive financial instruments that support cohesion within Europe by concentrating spending on the less-developed regions.\n\nThe particular aim of ESF spending is to support the creation of more and better jobs in the EU, which it does by co-funding national, regional and local projects that improve the levels of employment, the quality of jobs, and the inclusiveness of the labour market in the member states and their regions.\n\nThe European Social Fund was created in the founding Treaty of Rome in 1957. It is the oldest of the Structural Funds. It was established as a \"remedial instrument\" against the end of nationalist protectionism due to the advent of the European Economic Community.\n\nAs of 2015, the main goal is to foster employment, reduce social exclusion and invest in skills. In some EU countries it also supports administrative reform.\n\nThe overarching strategy of the European Union is the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to promote \"smart, sustainable, inclusive growth\" with greater coordination of national and European policies. In 2010 this succeeded the Lisbon Agenda which aimed to make Europe the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, and respect for the environment, by 2010. The objectives of Europe 2020 shape the priorities of the ESF.\n\nIn the light of the need to increase competitiveness and employment against a background of globalisation and ageing populations, the European Employment Strategy provides a coordinating framework for the Member States to agree common priorities and goals in the field of employment. These common priorities are then taken up in the Employment Guidelines and incorporated into the National Reform Programmes prepared by the individual Member States. ESF funding is deployed by the Member States in support of their National Reform Programmes as well as their National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSRF) which establish a member state's main priorities for spending the EU Structural Funds it receives.\n\nThe European Social Agenda also plays a role in shaping the priorities of ESF spending. The Social Agenda seeks to update the 'European social model' by modernising labour markets and social protection systems so that workers and businesses can benefit from the opportunities created by international competition, technological advances and changing population patterns while protecting the most vulnerable in society. In addition, the concept of 'flexicurity' contributes to current ESF initiatives. Flexicurity can be defined as a policy strategy to enhance the flexibility of labour markets, work organisations and labour relations, on the one hand, and employment security and income security on the other. The term flexicurity encompasses a new approach to employment involving 'work for life' rather than the 'job for life' model of the past. It encourages workers to take charge of their working lives through lifelong training, adapting to change and mobility.\n\nThe ESF is managed through seven-year programming cycles. The ESF strategy and budget is negotiated between the EU member states, the European Parliament and the EU Commission. The strategy defines the objectives of ESF funding, which it shares partly or wholly with other structural funding. For the current ESF funding cycle these objectives are:\n\nThe strategy also lays down broad priority axes – the actions required to achieve the objectives and which are eligible for funding.\n\nThe level of ESF funding differs from one region to another depending on their relative wealth. EU regions are divided into four categories of eligible regions, based on their regional GDP per capita compared to the EU average (EU with 25 or 15 Member States) and split between the two objectives.\n\nConvergence objective includes:\n\nThe regional competitiveness and employment objective includes:\n\nIn convergence regions, ESF co-financing of projects can reach 85% of total costs. In regional competitiveness and employment regions, 50% co-financing is more common. For the richer Member States and regions, ESF funding complements existing national employment initiatives; for less-wealthy Member States, ESF funding can be the main source of funds for employment-related initiatives. The eligible regions for the current ESF programming round (2007–2013) are shown on the map.\n\nWhile the allocation of funds to poorer regions intends to work towards the objective of convergence between regions (i.e. inter-regional equality), research has suggested that the funds may amplify intra-regional inequalities with for example in Poland richer municipalities receiving more funds than poorer municipalities within the regions. One explanation may lie in the co-financing procedures with poorer potential applicants being less likely to gather the required co-funding. Another issue with allocation has been that project applications have been rejected purely on minor administrative issues. While this has improved over time, research has shown that information provision and familiarity with application procedures is still a barrier in submitting applications for funds, and may play a larger role in than outright corruption in the selection process.\n\nWhile strategy definition is done at EU level, implementation of ESF funding is the responsibility of EU Member States and regions. Once the strategy and budget allocation have been agreed, a shared approach to programming is taken. Seven-year Operational Programmes are planned by Member States and their regions together with the European Commission. These Operational Programmes describe the fields of activity that will be funded, which can be geographical or thematic.\n\nThe Member States designate national ESF management authorities that are responsible for selecting projects, disbursing funds, and evaluating the progress and results of projects. Certification and auditing authorities are also appointed to monitor and ensure compliance of expenditure to the ESF regulation.\n\nUntil 2007, approximately 5% of ESF funds were allocated to 'Community Initiatives' to support transnational and innovative actions. They have addressed such issues as employment for women (NOW), disabled people (INTEGRA) and young people, new professions and qualifications (EUROFORM) and adaptability (ADAPT). The most recent of these, the EQUAL Community Initiative, saw in the admission of 10 new Member States in 2004 but ended in 2008.\n\nThe implementation of the ESF on the ground is achieved through projects which are applied for and implemented by a wide range of organisations, both in the public and private sector. These include national, regional and local authorities, educational and training institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the voluntary sector, as well as social partners, for example, trade unions and works councils, industry and professional associations, and individual companies.\n\nThe beneficiaries of ESF projects are varied, for example, individual workers, groups of people, industrial sectors, trades unions, public administrations or individual firms. Vulnerable groups of people who have particular difficulty in finding work or getting on in their jobs, such as the long-term unemployed and women, are a particular target group.

{"id": "51664929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51664929", "title": "European Union vs. Google", "text": "European Union vs. Google\n\nSince 2010, the European Union has launched three separate antitrust investigations into Google for violating the EU's competition laws due to its dominant position in the market. These cases have resulted in formal charges against Google related to Google Shopping, Google AdSense and the Android operating system. To date, Google has been found guilty of antitrust behavior in the cases related to Google Shopping and Android, and have been fined over .\n\nOn 10 November 2010, the European Commission opened a formal investigation into Google's search algorithm, following a number of complaints issued by smaller web companies that Google was downgrading their placement in results returned in Google's search results, and that Google was preferentially favoring their own products over competitors. The EC's investigation also considered if there were issues with Google's terms of use for Google AdSense that prevented those using AdSense to not use advertising from Google's competitors.\n\nOn 15 April 2015, five years into the investigation, the EC issued its first Statement of Objections towards Google related towards its preferential treatment of its Google Shopping product (including Google Product Search) in search results.\n\nThe specific complaints issued by the EC included:\n\nOn 7 June 2017, Google was found guilty and was charged (about ), the largest such antitrust fine issued by the EC.Google has denied the European Union's accusations against them and made a statement claiming “its services had helped the region's digital economy grow”. The fine represented just over 2.5% of Google's 2016 revenue.\n\nThose who are in competition with Google are pushing for their company to be individually monitored, for fear of losing more business to the dominant search engine. This would include investigating and overviewing Google's most prized search page algorithm, PageRank. The EU's Competition Commission decided to monitor their decision and Google's compliance with it, due to its obligation to report to the EUCC on a regular basis (every four months). Although the issue seems like it is at a close, the European Commission believes it will continue for some time.\n\nIn order to comply, Google is effectively separating its comparison shopping service into its own company after the fine. The Google Shopping service still will be a part of Google, but will run completely separately with its own revenues and profits. This move will allow Google to avoid further fines, according to Bloomberg, as it complies with the European Union's order of allowing even treatment to businesses, no matter if they compete with Google or not.\n\nHowever, even though Google is complying in part, the company is still appealing the decision. Google responded in its appeal papers to the EU Antitrust Fine by stating that the EU chair misstated facts and didn’t show enough evidence to prove that their site hurt rivals. Google wants the fine either overturned or reduced. The appeal was based on six arguments, with two of them being that the court didn’t prove that Google favored its own shopping service by placing paid ads on top the search results. Two of them stated that the courts misstated facts and evidence, and the other two argued that a fine wasn’t warranted as a possible penalty.\n\nWhile investigating the case related to Google Shopping, the EC found additional evidence related to potential antitrust issues related to Google AdSense, and issued a Statement of Complaints on 14 July 2016. These complaints were centered on how Google licensed AdSense to their direct partners:\n\nThis case, as of October 2018, still remains under investigation by the EC.\n\nThe EC's actions to investigate Google's approach to the Android operating system was predicated on two complaints it had received. The first complain came from FairSearch. FairSearch was established in 2010 as a coalition of travel-related web companies including Expedia and TripAdvisor to try to fight against Google's proposed acquisition of ITA, which had developed airfare search software. The group shifted towards becoming more of a Google watchdog group, looking at all instances of Google's activities which they considered were potentially anti-competition. Companies like Microsoft, Nokia, and Oracle joined the group to support this broader effort. Prior to their attention to the Android system, FairSearch issued complaints to the EC over how Google's search engines would preferentially weight results from Google's own services or its partners over others, as part of antitrust investigations conducted by the EU since 2010. In April 2013, the European branch of FairSearch filed a formal complaint to the EU, who were still investigating Google from previous complaints, citing that Google's practices with Android violated various EU's antitrust laws. The complaint identified that Google required any original equipment manufacturer (OEM) wanting to install Google's suite of Android apps, including access to the Google Play Store, had to license the entire suite and feature them predominately on the mobile device. \n\nA second anti-trust complaint against Google was filed by Aptoide in June 2014, an alternative marketplace for Android apps. Aptoide asserted that Google's approach to Google made it difficult for alternatives to the Google Play store to be installed, and that some of the components that were once part of Google's Android Open Source Project were moved into the Google Mobile Services suite, including Gmail, Google Maps, and the Play Store.\n\nOn 15 April 2015, the European Commission started an official investigation against Google following on the complaints filed by FairSearch and Apotoide and its own internal evaluation of these complaints over about a year. The EC stated that the company may have taken unlawful actions to maintain Google's dominant position in the mobile market by how it licensed its suite of Android applications. The new investigation was announced alongside the EC's findings in its antitrust investigation into Google's search engine practices, but otherwise treated as a separate action against Google.\n\nThe Commission identified three points of concern in the first Statement of Objections:\n\n\nGoogle countered to this investigation that their practices with Android were no different with how Apple, Inc. or Microsoft bundles their own proprietary apps on their respective iOS and Windows Phone, and that OEMs were still able to distribute Android-based phones without the Google suite of apps.\n\nDuring the investigation, Google formed Alphabet Inc., a holding company for Google's various subsidiaries, with Google becoming one of Alphabet's subsidiaries. \n\nA year after, on 20 April 2016, the European Commission announced the issue of the second Statement of Objections, now addressing both Google and Alphabet within its charges. The new set of complaints, amending those of the first Statement of Objections, asserted Google violated EU's antitrust laws by:\n\nThe potential fines for the case, if Google were to be found violating antitrust laws, has a maximum amount of 10% of the company's annual revenue, about at the time of the issuing of the Second Statement of Objection.\n\nOn 19 July 2018, EU has fined Google (about ). Google responded it would appeal, according to company spokesperson Al Verney \"Android has created more choice for everyone, not less\". To date, this fine is the biggest ever imposed by European Union on a company for anti-competitive behaviour. European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who was part of the decision against Google, stated that only after the EU found against Google in the search anti-trust case in 2017 did Google attempt to settle on the issues of the Android anti-trust issues, which was far too late after the EU filed the initial charges against Google.\n\n"}

The title is widely used in North American non-profit organizations, though many United States nonprofits have adopted the title president or CEO.\n\nConfusion can arise because the words \"executive\" and \"director\" occur both in this title and in titles of various members of some organizations' boards of directors. The precise meanings of these terms are discussed in the board of directors article.\n\nThe role of the executive director is to design, develop and implement strategic plans for the organization in a manner that is both cost and time-efficient. The executive director is also responsible for the day-to-day operation of the organization, which includes managing committees and staff as well as developing business plans in collaboration with the board. In essence, the board grants the executive director the authority to run the organization. The executive director is accountable to the chairman of the board of directors and reports to the board on a regular basis – quarterly, semiannually, or annually. The board may offer suggestions and ideas about how to improve the organization, but the executive director decides whether or not, and how, to implement these ideas.\n\nThe executive director is a leadership role for an organization and often fulfills a motivational role in addition to office-based work. Executive directors motivate and mentor members, volunteers, and staff, and may chair meetings. The executive director leads the organization and develops its organizational culture.\n\nAs the title suggests, the executive director needs to be informed of everything that goes on in the organization. This includes staff, membership, budget, company assets, and all other company resources, to help make the best use of them and raise the organization's profitability and profile.\n\n"}

It was published in 1999. The book was reissued in a 2003 paperback edition under the title \"Unsustainable: How Economic Dogma Is Destroying American Prosperity\".\n\nThe book argues that the shift in the American work-force from industry to knowledge workers was setting the country up for an economic collapse. It criticizes financial innovation as a ruse to sell complex financial instruments and urged for more advanced manufacturing in the United States. The book argues that industrial activities create jobs and exports, and that job salaries would be protected in environments using high-end equipment.\n\nIn its first chapter, the book enunciates the “Three Strikes Against the New Economy”: a bad job mix, slow income growth. and a dearth of exports.\n\nThe book elicited strong and mixed responses. Liberal economist James K. Galbraith said in \"The New York Times\" that Fingleton was “the sort of journalist economists despise,” arguing that the book was “anecdotal, spurning statistics or other corroboration” and that it overstated the decline of American manufacturing. Conservative economist George C. Leef commented that his snap judgment based on the cover was that it was “a lousy book” and that upon reading it, it “turned out to be far worse than I had guessed.”\n\nEconomist Paul Craig Roberts and activist Loren Goldner both supported the book's message. Roberts viewed the book as substantially vindicated by the Wall Street crash of 2007-2008 as well as by the earlier dot.com bust of the late 1990s.\n\n"}

After moving to Japan, he lived in Toda, Saitama Prefecture, and had two children with his wife. He established a telecommunications business, Ryo International, in 1995, which sold prepaid telephone cards and mobile phones; it had been growing rapidly, from ¥40 million of sales in 2000 to ¥350 million in 2001 and ¥800 million in 2003. He gained permanent residency in Japan in 2000. He had an office in Tokyo's Akihabara district as well a branch in Yokosuka, where he employed three Filipina immigrants, but rarely visited the Yokosuka office, according to the building's owner.\n\nHimu was arrested in a dawn raid on 26 May 2004 in Tokyo on charges of falsifying business-related documents; police targeted him because of his alleged connection to French fugitive Lionel Dumont, who had stayed in Japan between 2002 and 2003. He had met Dumont at a mosque in Isesaki, Gunma Prefecture in 1999; eager to do business, Himu gave Dupont his namecard, and sold him several phone cards. Police also raided the branch office in Yokosuka, where they arrested a Bangladeshi employee of Himu's. The media referred to him as \"Japan's first suspected Islamic terrorist\", while United States Forces Japan spokesmen claimed he had been seen at the Yokosuka Naval Base directly across from his office \"gathering intelligence\". He had been under surveillance for nearly a year before the arrest, according to Japanese media reports.\n\nHimu was indicted on 7 July 2004 by the Tokyo Summary Court, which ordered him to pay a fine of ¥300,000 for his violation of the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Law, consisting of having employed his younger brother and another illegal foreign resident between August 2001 and May 2004. Following his payment of the fine, he was released. The prosecutors declined to indict him on any charges relating to alleged al-Qaeda connections.\n\nAfter Himu's release, he found his business and his life disrupted; his employees had all departed, and bills he had been unable to collect while in custody while his suppliers waited for payment left him with ¥120 million in debt. Many of his former associates declined to do business with him any more; transportation companies even refused to ship his products. Eventually, with his business bankrupt, he closed down his existing offices and opened up a new business under a different name. Several countries also barred him from obtaining a visa due to the unproven allegations.\n\nIn April 2005, Himu filed a human rights complaint with the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, hoping to gain a public apology from senior police officials and the Japanese media, whom he accused of having \"ruined [his] life\". In October of that year, he also filed libel suits in the Tokyo District Court in his own name and that of his company against various media organisations, including Kyodo News and the Nippon Television Network. In December 2007, the Tokyo District Court ordered the \"Sankei Shimbun\" to pay Himu in compensation for their having published a front-page report giving his true name and falsely claiming he was a \"top terrorist\"; the court stated that the publication of his name was inappropriate.\n\n"}

In the public sphere, he was influential in the founding of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nChoate was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on January 24, 1832.

He was the president of the state of Acre just before and after it was purchased by Brazil. After the war he became extremely wealthy as a rubber producer, and made many enemies. He was assassinated in 1908. He is considered a hero of Brazil.\n\nJosé Plácido de Castro was born on 9 September 1873 in São Gabriel, Rio Grande do Sul.\nHis great grandfather had served in the 1801 war in which the Missões territory was annexed to Rio Grande do Sul and his grandfather had fought in the 1820s Cisplatine War between the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata and the Empire of Brazil.\nHis father, captain Prudente da Fonseca Castro, fought in Uruguay and in the Paraguayan War (1864–70).\nHis mother was Zeferina de Oliveira Castro.\n\nHis father died when he was twelve years old, and Plácido de Castro had to work to help support his mother and six brothers.\nHe took various jobs before joining the 1st Regiment of Field Artillery in 1889 at the age of 16.\nA few months later he enrolled in the Rio Pardo School of Tactics.\nIn 1892 he returned to his regiment as a staff sergeant.\nThe next year he entered the Porto Alegre Military Academy.\nJosé Plácido was studying there at the start of the Federalist Revolution in 1893.\nHe considered that the government of Marshal Floriano Peixoto was illegitimate, and direct elections should have been held to choose a new president.\nHe joined the rebels and reached the rank of major.\nAfter the revolt was defeated in 1895 he refused the government amnesty and left the army.\nHe stayed for a short time in São Gabriel, then moved to Rio de Janeiro, at that time the capital of Brazil.\n\nPlácido de Castro arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 1896.\nHe was given a position at the Military College of Rio de Janeiro as an inspector of students.\nHe lost this job due to a quarrel with a teacher, and by March 1898 was working with the Companhia Docas de Santos, which ran the docks in the port of Santos, São Paulo.\nEarly in 1899 he accepted an offer from the engineer Orlando Correia Lopes to go to Acre to work on delimiting rubber concessions.\nAt that time Acre belonged to Bolivia, but was mainly occupied by Brazilian rubber tappers.\nHe began to work as a land surveyor, and soon fell ill with malaria.\n\nIn July 1899 the Brazilians in Acre declared the Independent Republic of Acre.\nThis was quickly dissolved by troops sent by the Brazilian government.\nBolivia sent a small military mission to occupy Acre that was stopped by the rubber tappers.\nSilvério José Néri, governor of Amazonas, dispatched an expedition to Acre, known as the \"Poets Expedition\" due to the intellectuals among its members, which declared a second Independent Republic of Acre in November 1890.\nThis time the republic was overthrown by Bolivian troops.\n\nThe newspapers now reported an alleged agreement where Bolivia would lease Acre to an Anglo-American \"Bolivian syndicate\" for 30 years, and would send troops armed by the United States to defend the territory.\nThe possibility of losing control of the rubber trade alarmed the merchants of Pará, who until then had not backed the Amazonas merchants in trying to displace Bolivia from Acre.\nBolivian president José Manuel Pando obtained approval from Congress for the syndicate plan on 21 December 1901.\nThe news that a US concern backed by troops was taking over caused panic among the Brazilian rubber tappers in Acre.\n\nPlácido de Castro was working in the Purus River area when he heard of the Bolivian government's leasing plan.\nAt the start of 1902 he accepted an invitation from Rodrigo de Carvalho and two other large rubber producers to lead a revolt against Bolivia.\nPlácido de Castro took a boat up the Acre river, ostensibly to conduct land surveys in the south but in fact carrying arms and ammunition. \nHe stopped off briefly in Puerto Alonso (also called Puerto Acre, now Porto Acre) to meet the Bolivian governor Lino Romero and evaluate his future opponent.\nIn the south he organised the rubber tappers and other inhabitants for the revolt.\nHe then returned to Brazil, bypassing Puerto Alonso to avoid alerting the Bolivians.\nPlácido participated in the 1 July 1902 meeting at which the revolutionary junta was formed with a goal of obtaining the independence of Acre and then integrating it with Brazil.\n\nAlthough he argued for immediately attacking the garrison of 230 troops at Puerto Alonso, Plácido de Castro was persuaded to first take the outpost at Xapuri.\nHe entered Xapuri with 33 men in the early morning of 6 August 1902 and captured the sleeping garrison without spilling blood.\nOn 7 August 1902 he issued a manifesto proclaiming that Acre was independent.\nHe planned to next take Puerto Acre, but news of an approaching column of Bolivian troops from the Orthon River caused many of his 200 men to desert.\nWhen the remaining 63 rebels were attacked at Volta da Empresa (now Rio Branco) on 18 September 1902 they were decisively defeated, losing half their number. \nThe Bolivian commander, Colonel Rojas, issued a proclamation in which he called the rebels and their leaders cowards.\nAs a result, Plácido's ranks quickly swelled to at least 500 angry rubber tappers.\n\nRojas had lost men and was short of supplies. \nHe made camp at Volta da Empresa and sent messengers to Puerto Alonso and Riberalta asking for fresh guns and ammunition.\nPlácido de Castro surrounded the Bolivian camp but failed to achieve surprise in an attack on 5 October 1902 and instead settled into a siege, digging diagonal trenches to close in on the Bolivians.\nHe invited Rojas to surrender on 9 October.\nRojas held out for a few more days, then surrendered on 15 October and led his disarmed men back to Bolivia.\nOn 14 October 1902 the rebels captured some of the outer defences of Puerto Alonso and the armed Bolivian launch \"Rio Afua\", which they renamed the \"Independencia\".\nFurther successful fighting continued in the south against a column of Bolivian rubber tappers and a picket of poorly trained troops at Santa Rosa del Abuná.\n\nPlácido de Castro could not persuade his men to continue south to destroy the Bolivian base on the Orthon, and turned back towards Puerto Alonso.\nLino Romero had failed to organise for defence.\nPlácido de Castro surrounded the town on 8 January 1903, and launched an attack on 15 January 1903 that soon petered out.\nBy now Plácido had 2,000 men under his command. \nThey started to dig zigzag trenches to the Bolivian lines.\nEventually, with his forces exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Romero surrendered on 24 January 1903.\nPlácido de Castro's leadership skills had played a key role in the success of the revolt, helped by supplies of food, ammunition and weapons from the great rubber barons of Acre.\n\nThe Brazilian government sent troops under General Olímpio da Silveira to take control.\nPlácido de Castro went to Rio de Janeiro to report on the campaign to José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco. \nOn his journey he was acclaimed in Manaus and Belém, and received with honour in Rio.\nHe declined an offer to become a colonel in the National Guard.\nIn August 1903 Plácido was made provisional commander of the army of Acre and president of the territory of Acre.\nPlácido de Castro's views were those of a \"caudillo\" rather than a democrat.\nHe was not impressed by Brazil's lack of support for the revolt, and favoured an independent state of Acre.\nHowever, under the Treaty of Petrópolis of 17 November 1903 Brazil formally acquired Acre for two million pounds sterling, ceded some land in Mato Grosso and undertook to build the Madeira-Mamoré Railroad to allow export of Bolivian products via the Amazon River.\nPlácido remained leader of Acre until February 1904.\n\nAfter leaving office Plácido de Castro bought the Capatará rubber concession on credit, and also obtained property in Bolivia.\nHe became a major landowner, culminating with the purchase on credit of the great Bagaço rubber concession.\nHis rapidly acquired fortune earned him enemies.\nIn June 1906 he was appointed prefect of Alto Acre, one of the four departments of the territory of Acre.\nHe had to deal with various intrigues, including opposition by a former subordinate, Colonel Alexandrino José da Silva.\nHe resigned from his post due to a disagreement with the government.\n\nOn 9 August 1908, as he was preparing to return to Rio Grande do Sul, he fell into an ambush prepared by José da Silva.\nHe was shot from behind, and died two days later.\nHis dying words were recorded as, \"Death is a phenomenon as natural as life. He who knows how to live will know how to die. I only lament that having had so much occasion for glorious death, these 'heroes' have shot me in the back.\"\nHis body was taken to Porto Alegre and buried in the Santa Casa cemetery.\n\nPlácido de Castro has become admired as a hero of Brazil.\nThe municipality of Plácido de Castro, Acre, was created in 1963.\nRio Branco has a Praça Plácido de Castro.\nJosé Plácido de Castro was included in the Tancredo Neves Pantheon of the Fatherland and Freedom in Brasília on 17 November 2004 as the liberator of Acre.\nThe Rio Branco International Airport was renamed the Rio Branco-Plácido de Castro International Airport in 2009.\n\n"}

He has extensive business interests, run through Mawarid Holding, but is probably better-known as the owner of Juddmonte Farms. As such, he is one of the leading figures in the world of thoroughbred horseracing and the list of outstanding horses to have competed in Prince Khalid's racing-colours includes the greats: Dancing Brave, Enable, Frankel and Arrogate.\n\nPrince Khalid is one of the sons of Abdullah bin Abdul-Rahman a younger half-brother of King Abdulaziz.Prince Khalid is a half first cousin to all the sons of King Abdulaziz and the six siblings who have ruled modern Saudi Arabia in succession to their father the founder.\n\nPrince Khalid's wife, Al Jawhara bint Abdulaziz, is herself a daughter of King Abdulaziz, by his wife Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. She is therefore a full sister of the group of sons known as the Sudairi Seven, who include King Fahd and the present monarch, King Salman.\n\nPrince Khalid was born in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, in 1937. He studied history in the United States and Riyadh, was employed for a time at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He then embarked on an extremely successful career in business, serving an apprenticeship under the guidance of Sulaiman Olayan.\n\nKhalid Abdullah's main business vehicle is Mawarid Holding, one of Saudi Arabia's largest and most diversified private businesses, with extensive dealings in financial services, manufacturing, construction, medical supplies, catering, telecommunications and the media. A study of the commercial activities of members of the House of Saud published in 2001 listed 65 separate entities in which Prince Khalid held an interest. He is the owner of Orbit Communications Company. Until 8 February 2009 he served as chairman of the Saudi Chemical Company's board of directors and as chairman of Saudi Arabian Amiantit Company.\n\nBy the early 2000s responsibility for running his business had passed, in part, to Prince Khalid's four sons.\n\nIn 1990, Prince Khalid's wealth was estimated by \"Fortune magazine\" at $1.0 billion.\n\nAlthough Prince Khalid's father had owned horses, he had not kept them for racing. Prince Khalid's introduction to the sport came on a trip to Longchamp with friends in 1956. Even so, he did not start owning racehorses himself until the late 1970s. Prince Khalid's purchases of yearlings at that time heralded the start of the large scale investment in horseracing by owners from the Middle East that was to transform the sport.\n\nIn 1977 Prince Khalid's first racing adviser, the former trainer Humphrey Cottrill, bought for him four yearlings at the Newmarket sales. The following year Prince Khalid bought the top two lots in the Houghton Sales at Newmarket, although the top-priced yearling, Sand Hawk, for whom he paid a record 264,000 guineas, proved largely a disappointment; as would Convention, for whom he paid 1.4 million guineas in 1983. However, Cottrill and the trainer Jeremy Tree had also paid $225,000 for a dark bay colt by In Reality at the Keeneland Sales of 1978, their single purchase, as Known Fact, won the Middle Park Stakes in the autumn of 1979 and then, after Nureyev's disqualification, the 2,000 Guineas of 1980, following up his victory with a win in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.\n\nKnown Fact's victory in the 2,000 Guineas was not only Prince Abdullah's first victory in an English Classic race but was also the first by any Arab owner. His first winner of any kind had come the previous season, when Charming Native came home first at Windsor, while Abeer had provided his first victory at Royal Ascot with her win in the Queen Mary Stakes.\n\nPrince Khalid's colours, of green silks with white sleeves and a pink sash and cap, soon became a regular feature of the winner's enclosure in all the classic races of the world. In 1985, Rainbow Quest won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The following year, Dancing Brave repeated that success and also won the 2,000 Guineas and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Furthermore, Dancing Brave failed only narrowly to add a victory in the Derby to this remarkable season.\n\nIn 1982 Prince Khalid had his first home-bred winner with Fine Edge at Newmarket. His Juddmonte breeding operation soon produced Warning, by Known Fact out of the broodmare Slightly Dangerous, who became Europe’s champion miler in the 1988 season. Remarkably, Prince Khalid went on to win all five British Classic races with homebred horses: Quest For Fame, sired by Rainbow Quest, won Juddmonte's first Epsom Derby in 1990, followed by Commander In Chief (a son of Dancing Brave) in 1993, and finally the fourth-generation Juddmonte-bred Workforce, who broke the course record at Epsom with the victory in 2010. Toulon won the St Leger of 1991 and Zafonic carried off the 2,000 Guineas brilliantly two years later, as did Frankel in 2011. Reams of Verse won The Oaks in 1997 and Wince won the 1,000 Guineas in 1999, followed by Special Duty's victory in the same race in 2010.\n\nThe winner of not just the 2,000 Guineas, but also of multiple Group One races, including the Juddmonte-sponsored International Stakes at York, Frankel was bred by Prince Khalid through three generations via his mare Kind. He is named after Bobby Frankel, who had trained Prince Khalid's horses in America. Many regard him to be one of the greatest racehorses of all time.\n\nJuddmonte also bred a clean sweep of French Classic winners. Sanglamore, won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1990, whilst Houseproud, Zenda and Special Duty won Poule d'Essai des Pouliches in 1990, 2002 and 2010. Jolypha and Nebraska Tornado won the Prix de Diane, in 1992 and 2003 respectively, and Raintrap and Sunshack were the winners of Prix Royal-Oak, in 1993 and 1995, before American Post took the Poule d'Essai des Poulains in 2004. Finally, there was victory for Rail Link in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe of 2006, a success repeated by Workforce in 2010 (making this horse only the sixth horse in history to win both the Derby and the Arc ) and Enable in 2017.\n\nIn Ireland, the list of Juddmonte-bred successes includes Irish Oaks winners Wemyss Bight and Bolas in 1993 and 1994. In North America, the winning horses include Empire Maker, winner of the Belmont Stakes of 2003 and Flute, the Kentucky Oaks winner in 2003. The Eclipse Award champion mares include Ryafan in 1997, Banks Hill in 2001, and Intercontinental in 2005. The last two of these both won the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf, which was also won in 2009 by Midday, a three-time winner of the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood.\n\nIn North America, Prince Khalid was the recipient of an Eclipse Award as Top Owner in 1992 and 2003, and received five awards as the Top Breeder: in 1995, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2009. In 2003, Prince Khalid finished third in the American owners' championship.\n\nIn Europe, Prince Khalid's 78 winners in Britain and 58 winners in France made him the champion owner in both those countries in 2003, and he was British flat racing's champion owner again in 2010, with 74 winners and prize money of more than £3 million. He took the British title once more in 2011, when he had 63 winners and won more than £3.4 million in prize money.\n\nIn 1983 he was made an honorary member of The Jockey Club.\n\nPrince Khalid's horses were initially trained mainly by Jeremy Tree, to whom he was introduced by Humphrey Cottrill, and by Guy Harwood, who trained Dancing Brave. The circle of trainers widened to include the yards of Roger Charlton, Andre Fabre, Henry Cecil, Barry Hills, John Gosden, Pascal Bary, Dermot Weld and others, as well as latterly Sir Michael Stoute. In the US, his horses were for a long time in the care of Bobby Frankel. Prince Khalid's support for Cecil helped maintain the trainer's Warren Place stables through lean years in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIn 1982, Khalid bin Abdullah purchased Cayton Park Stud at Wargrave in Berkshire, renaming it Juddmonte Farms. From the early 1980s he built up a collection of carefully selected mares, in the early days buying from Robert Sangster. By 2011 these represented, according to Lord Grimthorpe in an interview given to the \"Financial Times\", \"one of the greatest brood-mare bands in the history of breeding”.\n\nThe British arm of the Juddmonte operations came to include Juddmonte Dullingham and Estcourt Estate in Gloucestershire, as well as Side Hill Stud and Banstead Manor in Newmarket in Suffolk. There, Prince Khalid stood a number of leading stallions, notably Dansili and Oasis Dream; in 2011 their nomination fee was £65,000 and £85,000 respectively for each mare in foal. Juddmonte also owns Ferrans Stud and New Abbey Stud in Ireland, as well as Juddmonte Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nThe studs in Britain and Ireland are managed by Philip Mitchell, who joined Juddmonte as General Manager of European Operations in 1988, while John Chandler handles arrangements in America. Humphrey Cottrill acted as his racing manager and adviser from 1977 to his retirement in 1982, when he was replaced by Grant Pritchard-Gordon, who was in turn succeeded by the current racing manager, Lord Grimthorpe, in 1998.\n\nPrince Khalid was responsible for the allocation of horses to trainers and for approval of mating lists. In a rare interview in 2010 he told \"The Racing Post\": \"When I was at the sales I realised that it would be easier to buy horses and race them, but I got the feeling that this was not enough, that it would be more fun to do what people like the Aga Khan and Lord Howard de Walden did and build up your own families.\" He said that he had his stud book with him all the time.\n\nIn 2011 the Juddmonte operation employed around 250 people and extended to 700-800 horses around the world, with a racing stock of about 250. That year they bought just two yearlings while selling more than 100 horses. In his \"Financial Times\" interview Lord Grimthorpe said Juddmonte was \"not run as a commercial operation\"; Prince Khalid once told The Racing Post, \"It is still my only hobby\".\n\nPrince Khalid is married to Al Jawhara bint Abdulaziz, daughter of King Abdulaziz and Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. They have four sons and three daughters.\nPrince Khalid is father-in-law to the late Prince Fahd, son of King Salman, who married his daughter Nuf bint Khalid bin Abdallah. The son-in-law Prince Fahd owned Generous, winner of the Epsom and Irish Derbies in 1991.\nPrince Khalid was one of the closest friends of the late King Fahd, his brother-in-law.\n\nPrince Khalid has homes in Saudi Arabia and overseas, close to his various stables or to the classic racecourses. In the United States, he has a home in Kentucky, in Europe, a townhouse in France, on the Parc Monceau in Paris, and, in the United Kingdom, houses in London, Newmarket and Kent, where he owns the 1,000-acre Fairlawne Estate, adjoining Plaxtol, near Shipbourne.\n\nHe is widely reported to be studiously courteous and personally unassuming.\n\nHis son Saud serves as Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of Al-Mawarid Holding Company and as Vice chairman of the Board of Directors of the Orbit Satellite Television and Radio Network.\n\n"}

The Dieppe Raid in early 1942 showed that the idea of seizing a port in the face of modern coastal defences was either costly or impossible. The US Navy saw the vital importance of being able to build their own port facilities and to deploy naval construction teams trained and dedicated for just that role. The US Army soon followed with their own units.\n\nThe NLPs were constructed of welded steel flotation units that were assembled like children's wooden block toys, connected by special angle-iron pieces, called stringers. The flotation boxes and stringers were held together by special iron wedge pins. The flotation blocks came in two types: The principal type of unit was a rectangular prism; the majority of NLPs were constructed using these. The second type was similar but curved upward on one side, and these boxes were used to make bows on the front of NLP barges when required.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "639104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=639104", "title": "Newsday", "text": "Newsday\n\nNewsday is an American daily newspaper that primarily serves Nassau and Suffolk counties and the New York City borough of Queens on Long Island, although it is also sold throughout the New York metropolitan area. As of 2009, its weekday circulation of 377,500 was the 11th-highest in the United States, and the highest among suburban newspapers. In 2012, \"Newsday\" expanded to include Rockland and Westchester county news on its website. As of January 2014, Newsday's total average circulation was 437,000 on weekdays, 434,000 on Saturdays and 495,000 on Sundays.\n\nThe newspaper's headquarters is in Melville, New York, in Suffolk County.\n\nFounded by Alicia Patterson and her husband, Harry Guggenheim, the publication was first produced on September 3, 1940 from Hempstead. For many years until a major redesign in the 1970s, \"Newsday\" copied the \"Daily News\" format of short stories and lots of pictures (Ironically, Patterson was fired as a writer at her father's \"Daily News\" in her early 20s, after getting the basic facts of a divorce wrong in a published report). After Patterson's death in 1963, Guggenheim became publisher and editor.\n\nIn 1967, Guggenheim turned over the publisher position to Bill Moyers and continued as president and editor-in-chief. But Guggenheim was disappointed by the liberal drift of the newspaper under Moyers, criticizing what he called the \"left-wing\" coverage of Vietnam War protests. The two split over the 1968 presidential election, with Guggenheim signing an editorial supporting Richard Nixon, when Moyers supported Hubert Humphrey.\n\nGuggenheim sold his majority share to the then-conservative Times-Mirror Company over the attempt of newspaper employees to block the sale, even though Moyers offered $10 million more than the Times-Mirror purchase price; Moyers resigned a few days later. Guggenheim, who died a year later, disinherited Moyers from his will.\n\nAfter the competing \"Long Island Press\" (not to be confused with the alternative weekly of the same name) ceased publication in 1977, \"Newsday\" launched a separate Queens edition, followed by a New York City edition dubbed \"New York Newsday\". In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with the Tribune Company, partnering \"Newsday\" with the New York City television station WPIX (Channel 11), also owned by Tribune.\n\nWith the Times Mirror-Tribune merger, the newspaper founded by Alicia Patterson was now owned by the company that was founded by her great-grandfather, Joseph Medill — which owns the \"Chicago Tribune\" and, until 1991, also owned her father's \"Daily News\". (Tribune sold the \"Daily News\" to British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell. After Maxwell's death in 1992, his publishing empire collapsed and Mortimer Zuckerman purchased the \"Daily News\".) Chicago, Illinois, real estate magnate Samuel Zell purchased Tribune in 2007.\n\nNews Corporation, headed by CEO Rupert Murdoch, attempted to purchase \"Newsday\" for US$580 million in April 2008. This was soon followed by a matching bid from Zuckerman and a $680 million bid from Cablevision. In May 2008, News Corporation withdrew its bid, and on May 12, 2008, \"Newsday\" reported that Cablevision would purchase the paper for $650 million. The sale was completed July 29, 2008.\n\nAltice, a Netherlands-based multinational telecoms company, bought Cablevision, including Newsday and News 12 in 2016. However, Altice then sold a majority (75%) stake in Newsday back to Cablevision's former owner Charles Dolan and his son Patrick, making Patrick the CEO of Newsday``. Altice disposed of its remaining stake in Newsday at the end of July 2018, which, combined with Charles Dolan's transfer of shares to son Patrick, makes Patrick the sole owner of Newsday.\n\nDespite having a tabloid format, \"Newsday\" is not known for being sensationalistic, as are other local daily tabloids, such as the New York \"Daily News\" and the \"New York Post\".\n\nIn 2004, the alternative weekly newspaper \"Long Island Press\" (which is not related to the defunct daily of the same name) wrote that \"Newsday\" has used its clout to influence local politics in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.\n\nBill Moyers briefly served as publisher. During the tenure of publisher Robert M. Johnson in the 1980s, Newsday made a major push into New York City. The paper's roster of columnists and critics has included Cathy Young, Jimmy Breslin, Barbara Garson, Normand Poirier, Murray Kempton, Gail Collins, Pete Hamill, Sydney Schanberg, Robert Reno (died 2012), Jim Dwyer, sportswriter Mike Lupica, music critic Tim Page, and television critic Marvin Kitman. The paper featured both advice columnists Ann Landers and Dear Abby for several years. From 1985 to 2005, Michael Mandelbaum wrote a regular foreign affairs analysis column for Newsday. Noted writer and biographer Robert Caro was an investigative reporter.

{"id": "36860424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36860424", "title": "Office of the Ombudsman (New Zealand)", "text": "Office of the Ombudsman (New Zealand)\n\nThe Office of the Ombudsman (in Māori: \"Tari o te Kaitiaki Mana Tangata\") was established in 1962 under the Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsman) Act 1962. The term \"Ombudsman\" is Swedish and basically means \"grievance person\". The primary role of the Ombudsman in New Zealand is to investigate complaints against government agencies. In 1983 the responsibilities were extended to include investigation of agencies that fail to provide information requested in accordance with the Official Information Act. The Ombudsman also has responsibility to protect whistleblowers and investigate the administration of prisons and other places of detention.\n\nThe first Ombudsman in New Zealand was Guy Powles who had a previous background as a lawyer, soldier, administrator and diplomat. He held the position of Ombudsman from 1962 until his retirement in 1977. At the time of his appointment, only three other countries had an Ombudsman - Sweden, Finland and Denmark.\n\nThe Ombudsmen Act came into force in 1975. This allowed for the appointment of additional Ombudsmen in addition to the chief Ombudsman and extended the role to include local government agencies.\n\nIn 1983, the Official Information Act required government agencies to respond to requests for information (known as OIA requests) and the Ombudsman was given the task of investigating complaints against Ministers of the Crown and central government agencies when requested information was not supplied in a timely manner. In 1988 the Ombudsman's powers were extended to decisions made by local government agencies as well.\n\nIn 2001, the Protected Disclosures Act (commonly known as the “whistle-blower” legislation) was passed. This makes the Ombudsman responsible for \"providing advice and guidance to any employee who has made, or is considering making, a disclosure about serious wrongdoing in their workplace (either public or private sector)\". In 2005 all crown entities were brought within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction under the Ombudsmen Act and Official Information Act.\n\nIn 2007, the Office of the Ombudsman was designated as a National Preventive Mechanism (NPM) under the Crimes of Torture Act 1989 (COTA). This legislation establishes New Zealand’s human rights obligations under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“OPCAT”) to \"prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\" by establishing a system of regular and independent visits to prisons and other places of detention.\n\nNew Zealand's Chief Ombudsman (\"Nga Kaitiaki Mana Tangata\" in Māori) is appointed by the Governor-General of New Zealand on recommendation of the House of Representatives. The Chief Ombudsman is assisted by others who have the title of Ombudsman.\n\n\n\nThe Ombudsman's role is described in its Annual Report for 2012 as follows: \"We investigate, review and inspect the administrative conduct of state sector agencies, and provide advice and guidance, in order to ensure people are treated fairly in New Zealand” and that “a high level of public trust in government is maintained”.\n\nThe guiding principle of the Official Information Act is that \"information must be made available unless a good reason exists under the Acts for withholding it.\" The underlying purpose is \"to increase the availability of official information to promote more effective public participation in the making and administration of laws and policies; to promote the accountability of Ministers of the Crown and government officials; and to protect sensitive information where necessary in the public interest or to preserve personal privacy.\" Requests for information must be answered within 20 working days although the time limit can be extended. If a Government agency requires more time to answer a particular request, they have to provide the reason for any such extension.\n\nThe Act allows Government agencies to deny requests for information under certain circumstances. These include: the national security or defence of New Zealand; the maintenance of law and order; trade secrets and commercial confidentiality; personal privacy; and legal professional privilege. The Ombudsman's role is to ensure that government agencies provide information that is requested in accordance with the Act.\n\nThe agencies generating the most complaints tend to be ones that interact with and impact upon large numbers of New Zealanders. In 2011/12, these agencies were the Department of Corrections, the Earthquake Commission, the Ministry of Social Development, the Department of Labour (Immigration New Zealand), the Accident Compensation Corporation, and Inland Revenue Department. In that year, 97% of complaints came from individual members of the public. 34% were from prisoners or prisoner advocates (not all against the Department of Corrections), and 63% were from other members of the public. Only 3% of complaints were made by corporate entities and special interest groups.\n\nThe number of OIA complaints has been steadily increasing ever since the Act was passed. In 2012, the Ombudsman received 1,236 OIA complaints, an increase of 25 percent on 2010/11 numbers, and the highest number since the 2000 to 2001 period. Private individuals made approximately three-quarters of all OIA complaints; the media made about 12% while Members of Parliament and political party research units accounted for 4%. 41% of OIA complaints were due to a partial or complete refusal to provide information.\n\nIn 2011/12 the Ombudsman received 10,636 complaints, an increase of 22% on the previous year's numbers. Dame Beverley told Parliament the Office of the Ombudsman was \"in crisis, with a bulging backlog of cases due to lack of investigators\". Part of this was due to an increase in complaints about the Earthquake Commission and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and by 2011, the total number of complaints being received was double that provided for by the baseline funding. Dame Margaret said her staff were underpaid, overworked and were leaving - and \"in some cases were literally being worked to death\". She said her office was \"sinking under the weight of the complaint burden\" which was slowing down the resolution of complaints.\n\nIn 2013, the Ombudsman received 13,684 complaints, an increase of 29% on the previous year. The Ombudsman described this as \"an unprecedented increase in demand for its services...for the second year in a row. In response the Government provided extra funding in the budget in both 2013 and 2014. The increases enabled Dame Beverley to hire more investigators and she said her office should catch up on its backlog of complaints by 2015.\n\nIn 2012 Dame Beverley expressed concern at attempts by Government agencies to keep information secret by drafting laws to avoid the Official Information Act, referring in particular to new legislation on partial state asset sales, charter schools and changes to mining permits. The Ombudsman's Office argued at a select committee hearing that state assets associated with the Mixed Ownership Model Act would still be 51 per cent owned by the public and should remain subject to the Official Information Act (OIA). Dame Beverley said there was an increasing number of officials in government who fail to understand the constitutional importance of the legislation and that this trend was 'reprehensible' and 'extremely dangerous'.\n\nIn December 2012, the Ombudsman criticised the Ministry of Education over its response to requests for information about school closures in Christchurch. David McGee found the Ministry misled the Christchurch City Council by advising two school principals to withdraw their official requests \"in order to receive a better response.\" McGee said: \"Schools and parents should not have to ferret out information by making official information requests.\" The Ombudsman also expressed concerns that there may be a perception within the public sector that \"some requests for information can only be processed efficiently by somehow removing them from the OIA context\".\n\nIn March 2013 the Office of the Ombudsman announced it would conduct an own-motion investigation into the way the public service responds to requests made under the Official Information Act. It said it was receiving an increasing number of complaints by members of the public who felt \"shut out\". Constitutional lawyer Mai Chen said reluctance by Government departments to answer OIA requests raised concerns \"about how well public servants understood a law intended to give balance to the 'David and Goliath' inequality between citizen and government\". Labour's Claire Curren agreed on the need for an investigation saying: \"There is an emerging crisis with our watchdog agencies\", and this is contributing to a \"paralysis of democracy\".\n\nThe investigation began in December 2014 with over 63 state agencies required to participate.\n\nThe Ombudsman is one of a number of agencies responsible for protecting 'whistleblowers' – employees who report serious wrongdoing in their workplace under the Protected Disclosures Act, which came into force in 2001. The Act applies to both public and private sector workplaces. \"Serious wrongdoing\" includes unlawful, corrupt or irregular use of public money or resources; conduct that poses a serious risk to public health, safety, the environment or the maintenance of the law; any criminal offence; and gross negligence or mismanagement by public officials.\n\nThe Act states that employers cannot take legal or disciplinary proceedings against an employee who makes a 'protected disclosure', or brings their concerns to an 'appropriate authority'. The Act also states that if an employer takes retaliatory action, the employee can initiate a personal grievance case under the Employment Relations Act. The Human Rights Act may also be available to anyone who is victimised as a result of protected disclosures.\n\nChief Ombudsman Dame Beverley Wakem says only 10 to 12 people a year ring her office about the Act and even fewer have used it to reveal information. She says the law could have been used to prevent the collapse of so many finance companies – which covers employees in such companies. She also can't understand why nobody used the legislation to raise concerns about safety practices at the Pike River mine. Dame Beverley says she wants to find out how the Protected Disclosures Act could be used more effectively in such cases.\n\nThe Ombudsman is also part of \"National Preventive Mechanisms\" which administer The Crimes of Torture Act which establishes New Zealand’s international obligations under the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT). OPCAT was established to ensure a system of regular visits by independent international and national bodies to prisons, police cells and mental health hospitals in order to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Countries that have signed up to OPCAT allow their performance to be monitored by the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\nThe Ombudsman appoints Prison Investigators to visit prisons and other places of detention in New Zealand and to conduct investigations after complaints. The inspectors are entitled to interview anyone they choose, including prisoners and staff, who may be in a position to provide relevant information about the treatment of detainees, their access to health care and other conditions of detention. In 2012, the inspectors visited 70 places of detention, and made 24 formal inspections.\n\nFrom time to time, the Ombudsman also looks at systemic issues through “own motion” investigations. In 2011/12 the Ombudsmen completed a major investigation into the Provision, Access and Availability of Prisoner Health Services. The main issues identified in this report were deficiencies in the management of mentally unwell prisoners; concerns with the management of at risk (potentially suicidal) prisoners; inadequate resourcing of dental services; inadequate recording of requests to access health services, waiting times and health related complaints; and no process in place for external accreditation of any of the prison health services. Following the investigation, the Ombudsmen made 21 suggestions for Corrections to consider, and 31 specific recommendations for improvement.\n\nFrom time to time the Ombudsman makes submissions to Parliament on proposed pieces of legislation. In 2010 a submission was made on the Law Commission's Issues Paper 18 \"The Public’s Right to Know\" in which the Ombudsman supported the Law Commission’s view that it would not be desirable to exclude certain classes or categories of information from the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. In 2012 the Ombudsman made submissions on the Mixed Ownership Model Bill. Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill would remove Mixed Ownership companies from being subject to the Ombudsman Act (OA) and Official Information Act (OIA). The Ombudsman's submission said Mixed Ownership companies will still perform the same functions they currently perform, and the Crown as majority shareholder, would continue to have the determinative voice on all decisions - so it was 'highly desirable' that the OA and OIA should continue to apply to them.\n\nThe Ombudsman also made a submission on the Corrections Amendment Bill. Dame Beverley opposed sections of the Bill which would remove responsibility for the health care of prisoners from prison doctors. She opposed sections which would allow Corrections to use mechanical restraints on prisoners for more than 24 hours and sections which would allow prison officers to conduct strip searches without authorisation from the prison manager. She also opposed sections which would make it an offence to drink water before a random drug test with the intention of diluting the resulting urine sample (known as waterloading). The Ombudsman said this section was potentially a breach of a prisoner’s right to access drinking water.\n\n\n"}

In the 1990s, he took part in the restructuring and management of numerous industrial enterprises and financial institutions, at home and abroad. The most important projects at the time included Všeobecný vzájemný penzijní fond (General Mutual Pension Fund, today ING Pension Fund), the Otrokovice heat generation plant and the Newton Media.\n\nKraus invested a significant amount of finances in educating and supporting university students. In 2003, he founded Newton College. In the framework of such efforts, he then initiated the establishment of the Erudikon Endowment Fund in 2005 to provide university access to those individuals whose life situation would otherwise make it impossible.\n\nHe ended close cooperation with MUS already in 2002; nevertheless, the Swiss courts found him guilty (verdict not final) from alleged money laundering. As a result of the Swiss charges and the re-opening of the MUS case by the Czech authorities in 2012, his current accounts were frozen and his assets, including the home in which he was living, were seized.\n\nSince the very beginning of the investigation, Kraus has argued that he, like the rest of the sentenced entrepreneurs and managers, saved MUS and thus it was absurd to criminalise their efforts. Even with regard to the fact that MUS is, thanks to the then successful restructuring, a stable and important company employing thousands of people.\n\nOn Sunday, 20 October 2013, he proclaimed the following about MUS on the Czech Television programme Otázky Václava Moravce [Question Time with Václav Moravec]: \"This is a dispute about the form that the transformation of the Czech economy took. It is a dispute that should not be relegated to the offices of prosecutors, but aired out in the public domain to allow discussion on whether the process should have taken place as it had.\"\n"}

As a cognitive activity, it produces thought.\n\nWhen applied in an organizational strategic management process, strategic thinking involves the generation and application of unique business insights and opportunities intended to create competitive advantage for a firm or organisation. It can be done individually, as well as collaboratively among key people who can positively alter an organization's future. Group strategic thinking may create more value by enabling a proactive and creative dialogue, where individuals gain other people's perspectives on critical and complex issues. This is regarded as a benefit in highly competitive and fast-changing business landscapes.\n\nStrategic thinking includes finding and developing a strategic foresight capacity for an organization, by exploring all possible organizational futures, and challenging conventional thinking to foster decision making today. Recent strategic thought points ever more clearly towards the conclusion that the critical strategic question is not the conventional \"What?\", but \"Why?\" or \"How?\". The work of Henry Mintzberg and other authors, further support the conclusion; and also draw a clear distinction between strategic thinking and strategic planning, another important strategic management thought process.\n\nGeneral Andre Beaufre wrote in 1963 that strategic thinking \"is a mental process, at once abstract and rational, which must be capable of synthesizing both psychological and material data. The strategist must have a great capacity for both analysis and synthesis; analysis is necessary to assemble the data on which he makes his diagnosis, synthesis in order to produce from these data the diagnosis itself—and the diagnosis in fact amounts to a choice between alternative courses of action.\"\n\nThere is no generally accepted definition for strategic thinking, no common agreement as to its role or importance, and no standardised list of key competencies of strategic thinkers. There is also no consensus on whether strategic thinking is an uncommon ideal or a common and observable property of strategy. Most agree that traditional models of strategy making, which are primarily based on strategic planning, are not working. Strategy in today's competitive business landscape is moving away from the basic ‘strategic planning’ to more of ‘strategic thinking’ in order to remain competitive. However, both thought processes must work hand-in-hand in order to reap maximum benefit. It has been argued that the real heart of strategy is the 'strategist'; and for a better strategy execution requires a strategic thinker who can discover novel, imaginative strategies which can re-write the rules of the competitive game; and set in motion the chain of events that will shape and \"define the future\".\n\nIn the view of F. Graetz, strategic thinking and planning are “distinct, but interrelated and complementary thought processes” that must sustain and support one another for effective strategic management. Graetz's model holds that the role of strategic thinking is \"to seek innovation and imagine new and very different futures that may lead the company to redefine its core strategies and even its industry\". Strategic planning's role is \"to realise and to support strategies developed through the strategic thinking process and to integrate these back into the business\".\n\nHenry Mintzberg wrote in 1994 that strategic thinking is more about synthesis (i.e., \"connecting the dots\") than analysis (i.e., \"finding the dots\"). It is about \"capturing what the manager learns from all sources (both the soft insights from his or her personal experiences and the experiences of others throughout the organization and the hard data from market research and the like) and then synthesizing that learning into a vision of the direction that the business should pursue.\" Mintzberg argued that strategic thinking cannot be systematized and is the critical part of strategy formation, as opposed to strategic planning exercises. In his view, strategic planning happens \"around\" the strategy formation or strategic thinking activity, by providing inputs for the strategist to consider and providing plans for controlling the implementation of the strategy after it is formed.\n\nAccording to Jeanne Liedtka, strategic thinking differs from strategic planning along the following dimensions of strategic management:\nLiedtka observed five “major attributes of strategic thinking in practice” that resemble competencies:\n\n"}

Thompson and Oscar Acosta's legendary 1971 weekend trip to Las Vegas, immortalized in Thompson's novel \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\"\n\nThe Mint opened in 1957. Milton Prell, who also owned the Sahara Hotel and Casino and the Aladdin Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip, was one of the original owners of The Mint. Prell and his associates had engaged a firm to use a computer to come up with a list of possible names for this new addition to downtown Las Vegas. They had been working late into the night in Prell's home, when his wife Debbie came into the room and suggested the place be named The Mint.\n\nDel Webb assumed ownership around 1961 when he acquired other properties of Milton Prell.\n\nOn April 6, 1962, Sahara-Nevada Corporation – the operating group of the Sahara and Mint – announced plans for a 22-story hotel skyscraper addition to the Mint. The addition was expected to be completed within 16 months, at a cost of $5 million. The addition would be built on the Mint's north parking lot, and was to include 300 additional hotel rooms and suites. A six-story, parking garage would be connected to the new hotel building, and would include more than 550 parking spaces. In May 1962, the city planned to review the permit for the new tower. A groundbreaking ceremony was held for the tower in July 1962.\n\nConstruction was still ongoing in July 1964, at which point the tower was planned to include 24 floors. Construction reached the 24th floor at the end of the year, with plans for an additional four floors. The hotel tower was ultimately built with 26 stories, and was topped out on March 20, 1965, with plans to open later that month. The new tower stood , and was one of the tallest buildings in the state at the time, ranking only behind The Landmark Hotel and Casino, which stood . Renovations were also done to the existing building, which included work to the Merri Mint Theatre, and expanded dining areas.\n\nIn 1988, The Mint was sold and became part of Binion's Horseshoe.\n\nPatsy Cline performed at the Mint Casino's \"Merri-Mint Theater\" from November 23 - December 28, 1962, three months before her fatal plane crash. She appeared with Tompall & the Glaser Brothers, and at one point developed \"Vegas Throat\" due to the dry desert heat. For several shows Patsy lip-synched to her records. The Wilburn Brothers, with Loretta Lynn as part of their act, played the Merri-Mint for a couple of nights in October 1962. According to author Larry Jordan, in his book \"Jim Reeves: His Untold Story,\" Reeves also played at the Mint Casino in the early-1960s. Peter Urquidi, \"Man of Many Sounds\", played the Top of the Mint for more than a decade until the early-1970s. Upstairs in the lounge was the Johnny Elvis Foster show \"For The Love Of Elvis\". The Memphis Sound also played at the Mint. Sidney Fields of Abbott and Costello fame appeared on the same bill in a comedy act.\n\nThe casino appears in the 1964 film \"Viva Las Vegas\" and in the 1971 James Bond film \"Diamonds Are Forever\". The Mint can be seen in the background toward the end of the 1984 film \"Starman\". The casino can also be seen several times towards the end of the 1987 U2 music video \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", which was filmed entirely on Fremont Street. A computer-generated reconstruction of the casino can be seen in the 1998 film \"Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas\". The Mint is also seen in music videos by Panic! at the Disco from their 2013 album, \"Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!\"\n"}
{"id": "36196361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36196361", "title": "The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)", "text": "The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical black comedy crime film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, based on the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort. It recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm Stratton Oakmont engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street that ultimately led to his downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio (who was also a producer) stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his wife Naomi Lapaglia and Kyle Chandler as Patrick Denham, the FBI agent who tries to bring him down. Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Joanna Lumley and Jean Dujardin also star. The film marks the director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio, after \"Gangs of New York\" (2002), \"The Aviator\" (2004), \"The Departed\" (2006) and \"Shutter Island\" (2010), as well as his second collaboration with Winter after the television series \"Boardwalk Empire\" (2010–14).\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was the first to be released entirely through digital distribution. It was a major commercial success, grossing more than $392 million worldwide during its original theatrical run to become Scorsese's highest-grossing film and the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2013. The film was controversial for its morally ambiguous depiction of events, explicit sexual content, extreme profanity, depiction of hard drug use and the use of animals during production. The film also caused controversy due to accusations that it was financed by illegally obtained funds from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise for Scorsese's direction, the comedic performance of DiCaprio and the fast-paced and consistent humor. The film was nominated for several awards including five nominations at the 86th Academy Awards ceremony: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nominations for DiCaprio and Hill, respectively. The film did not win in any category, although DiCaprio did win Best Actor – Musical or Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, where the film was also nominated for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy. It was also recognized by numerous other awards ceremonies, as well as guilds and critics' associations.\n\nIn 1987, Jordan Belfort procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbroker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.\n\nJordan befriends his neighbor, Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell\". The basic method of the firm is a pump and dump scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont. After an exposé in \"Forbes\", hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia. When his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden. This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.\n\nDonnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and, while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Brad does not say a word about Donnie or Jordan to the police. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship is capsized in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.\n\nTwo years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Now fed up with Jordan's lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. Infuriated, Jordan hits Naomi twice, insults her as a \"cunt\" and tries to run off with his daughter Skylar in his car, but he ends up crashing in the driveway. The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie warning him. Donnie keeps the note and rats out Jordan to the FBI. Jordan is arrested for breaching his co-operation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite his breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves three years in a minimum security prison. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.\n\nIn 2007, Leonardo DiCaprio/Warner Bros. won a bidding war against Brad Pitt/Paramount Pictures for the rights to Jordan Belfort's memoir \"The Wolf of Wall Street\", and Martin Scorsese was considered to direct the film. During pre-production, Scorsese worked on the film's script before working on \"Shutter Island\". He describes having \"wasted five months of [his] life\" without getting a green light on production dates by the Warner Bros. studio. Jordan Belfort made $1 million on the movie rights.\n\nIn 2010, Warner Bros. had offered Ridley Scott to direct the film, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the male lead, but the studio eventually dumped the project.\n\nIn 2012, a green light was given by the independent company Red Granite Pictures allowing no restrictions to the content development. Scorsese knew that there were no limits to the content that he would produce and therefore came back on board, resulting in an R rating. Red Granite Pictures also asked Paramount Pictures to distribute the film; Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film in North America and Japan, but passed on the rest of the international market.\n\nThe FBI has issued subpoenas to several past and present employees of Red Granite Pictures in regards to allegations that US$155 million was diverted from the Malaysian wealth fund 1MDB to help finance \"The Wolf of Wall Street\". This relates to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal. A civil lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice has sought to claim \"any rights to profits, royalties and distribution proceeds\" from \"The Wolf of Wall Street\". To settle the civil lawsuit, Red Granite Pictures has agreed to pay US$60 million to the U.S. government.\n\nIn the film, most of the real-life characters' names have been changed from Belfort's original memoir. Donnie Azoff is based on Danny Porush. The name was changed after Porush threatened to sue the filmmakers. Porush maintains that much of the film was fictional and that Donnie Azoff was not in fact an accurate depiction of him. The FBI agent known as Patrick Denham is the stand-in for real-life Gregory Coleman, and lawyer Manny Riskin is based on Ira Sorkin. Belfort's first wife Denise Lombardo is renamed Teresa Petrillo, while second wife Nadine Caridi became Naomi Lapaglia on-screen. In contrast, Mark Hanna's name remains the same as the LF Rothschild stockbroker who, like Belfort, was convicted of fraud and served time in prison. Belfort's parents Max and Leah Belfort's names remained the same for the film. The role of Aunt Emma was initially offered to Julie Andrews, who refused it as she was recovering from an ankle injury, and she was replaced by Joanna Lumley.\n\nIn January 2014, Jonah Hill revealed in an interview with Howard Stern that he made only $60,000 on the film (the lowest possible SAG-AFTRA rate for his amount of work), while his co-star Leonardo DiCaprio (who also produced) received $10 million. Hill didn't care about his settlement though, and wanted to play Donnie Azoff so badly that he was willing to do whatever it took to get the part as it was his dream to be in a Scorsese film.\n\nFilming began on August 8, 2012, in New York. Jonah Hill announced that his first day of shooting was September 4, 2012. Filming also took place in Closter, New Jersey and Harrison, New York. In January 2013, additional scenes were shot at a set built in an abandoned office building in Ardsley, New York. Scenes at the beach house were filmed in Sands Point, New York.\n\nScorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker stated that the film would be shot digitally instead of on film. Scorsese had been a proponent of shooting on film but decided to shoot \"Hugo\" digitally because it was being photographed in 3D; however, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was originally planned to be shot digitally despite being filmed in 2D. Schoonmaker expressed her disappointment with the decision: \"It would appear that we've lost the battle. I think Marty just feels it's unfortunately over, and there's been no bigger champion of film than him.\" After extensive comparison tests during pre-production, eventually the majority of the film was shot on film stock while scenes that used green screen effects or low light were shot with the digital Arri Alexa. The film contains 400–450 VFX shots.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" uses animals including a chimpanzee, a lion, a snake, a fish, and dogs. The chimpanzee and the lion were provided by the Big Cat Habitat wildlife sanctuary in Sarasota County, Florida. The four-year-old chimpanzee Chance spent time with actor Leonardo DiCaprio and learned to roller skate over the course of three weeks. The sanctuary also provided a lion named Handsome because the film's trading company used a lion for its symbol. Danny Porush, Jordan Belfort's real-life partner, denied that there were any animals in the office, although he admitted to eating an employee's goldfish.\n\nIn December 2013, before the film's premiere, the organization Friends of Animals criticized the use of the chimpanzee and organized a boycott of the film. \"Variety\" reported, \"Friends of Animals thinks the chimp ... suffered irreversible psychological damage after being forced to act.\" \"The Guardian\" said, \"Criticism of \"The Wolf of Wall Street\"'s use of a chimpanzee arrives as Hollywood comes under ever-increasing scrutiny for its employment of animals on screen,\" referring to a November 2013 report in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" that was critical of the American Humane Association's treatment of animals in films. PETA also launched a campaign to highlight mistreatment of ape \"actors\" and to petition for DiCaprio not to work with great apes.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 17, 2013, followed by a wide release on December 25, 2013. It was previously slated to be released on November 15, 2013, but the date was pushed back after film cuts were made to reduce the run time. On October 22, 2013, it was reported that the film was set for a Christmas 2013 release. Paramount officially confirmed the Christmas Day 2013 release date on October 29, 2013, with a running time of 165 minutes. On November 25, 2013, the length was announced to be 179 minutes. It was officially rated R for \"sequences of strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language throughout, and for some violence\". Scorsese had to edit sexual content and nudity to avoid an NC-17 rating. By different counts, the film contains between 506 and 569 uses of the word \"fuck\", and currently holds the record for the most uses of the word in a mainstream non-documentary film.\n\nThe film is banned in Malaysia, Nepal, Zimbabwe, and Kenya because of its scenes depicting sex, drugs and excessive use of swear words, and additional scenes have been cut in the versions playing in India. In Singapore, after cuts were made to an orgy scene as well as some religiously profane or denigrating language, the film was passed R21.\n\nThe film marks a change in film history when Paramount became the first major studio to distribute movies to theaters in digital format, eliminating 35mm film entirely. \"\" was the last Paramount production to include a 35mm film version, while \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was the first major movie distributed entirely digitally.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" grossed $116.9 million in North America and $275.1 million internationally, for a total gross of $392 million, making it Scorsese's highest-grossing film worldwide. In North America, the film opened at number five in its first weekend, with $18.4 million in 3,387 theaters, behind \"\", \"Frozen\", \"\", and \"American Hustle\". In Australia, it is the highest grossing R-rated film, earning $12.96 million.\n\nAccording to copyright infringement tracking site Excipio, the film was the most illegally downloaded film of 2014, as it was shared over 30 million times via torrent sites.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 25, 2014. On January 27, 2014, it was revealed that a four-hour director's cut would be attached to the home release. It was later revealed by Paramount Pictures and Red Granite Pictures that the home release would feature only the theatrical release.\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" received positive reviews, with critics praising DiCaprio and Hill's performances, Scorsese's direction, and Winter's screenplay. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 78% based on 267 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Funny, self-referential, and irreverent to a fault, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" finds Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio at their most infectiously dynamic.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine named \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" as the third best film of 2013, behind \"12 Years a Slave\" and \"Gravity\" at numbers one and two, respectively. The movie was chosen as one of the top ten films of the year by the American Film Institute. Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said \"it is the best and most enjoyable American film to be released this year.\" \"The Chicago Sun-Times\"'s Richard Roeper gave the film a \"B+\" score, saying the film was \"good, not great Scorsese\".\n\nDana Stevens, a member of the New York Film Critics Circle, wrote that the movie did not work for her after labeling the film \"Epic in size, claustrophobically narrow in scope.\" According to Marshall Fine of \"The Huffington Post\" the story \"wants us to be interested in characters who are dull people to start with, made duller by their delusions of being interesting because they are high\". Some critics viewed the movie as an irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical takedown. DiCaprio responded that in his opinion the film does not glorify the excessive lifestyle it depicts.\n\nIn 2016, the film was ranked #78 on the BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century list. In June 2017, Richard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" named \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" as the 2nd best film of the 21st century so far, behind Jean-Luc Godard's \"In Praise of Love\" (2001).\n\n\"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was listed on many critics' top ten lists.\nThe film received a \"C\" rating from audiences surveyed by CinemaScore, a rating lower than anything else in theaters the opening week of the film. The \"Los Angeles Times\" argues that the film attracted conservative viewers by depicting a more moral tone in its marketing than the film itself depicted.\n\nChristina McDowell, daughter of Tom Prousalis, who worked closely with the real-life Belfort at Stratton Oakmont, wrote an open letter addressing Scorsese, DiCaprio, and Belfort himself, criticizing the film for insufficiently portraying the victims of the financial crimes created by Stratton Oakmont, for disregarding the damage that was done to her family as a result, and for giving celebrity to persons (Belfort and his partners, including her father) who do not deserve it.\n\nSteven Perlberg of \"Business Insider\" saw an advance screening of the film at a Regal Cinemas near the Goldman Sachs building, with an audience of financial workers. Perlberg reported cheers from the audience at what he considered to be all the wrong moments—\"When Belfort — a drug addict attempting to remain sober — rips up a couch cushion to get to his secret coke stash, there were cheers.\"\n\nThe former Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted the real Belfort criticized both the movie and the book on which it is based. He said he believes some of Belfort's claims were \"invented\", as for instance \"[Belfort] aggrandized his importance and reverence for him by others at his firm.\" He strongly criticizes the film for not depicting the \"thousands of [scam] victims who lost hundreds of millions of dollars\", not accepting the filmmakers' argument that it would have detracted attention from the wrongdoers. Furthermore, he deplores the ending—\"beyond an insult\" to his victims—in which the real Belfort appears, while showing \"a large sign advertising the name of Mr. Belfort's real motivational speaking company\", and a positive depiction of Belfort uttering \"variants of the same falsehoods he trained others to use against his victims\".\n\nThe film was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese, Best Adapted Screenplay for Winter, Best Actor for DiCaprio, and Best Supporting Actor for Hill. It was also nominated for four BAFTAs, including Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay, and two Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. DiCaprio won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" features both original as well as existing music tracks, and was released on December 17, 2013 for digital download.\n\nMore than sixty songs were used in the film, but only sixteen were included on the official soundtrack. Notably, among the exceptions are original compositions by Theodore Shapiro.\n\n\n"}

Evans's great-grandmother Elinor was the sister of Thomas Mellon, the father of the wealthy financier, Andrew W. Mellon. Orphaned as a young boy, Thomas was sent to stay with his mother's relatives in Tennessee before returning to Pittsburgh to live with his mother's sister. She and her husband were affluent enough to provide Thomas with a quality education and he graduated from the Shady Side Academy private school in 1927 and Yale University in 1931.\n\nFor a few years after finishing university, Thomas Evans held a clerical job at Gulf Oil, owned at the time by the Mellon family. Ambitious, he saved as much money as he could from his salary and together with a small inheritance, set out on his own. In 1939, he was able to purchase the bankrupt H.K. Porter, Inc., a manufacturer of light-duty railroad locomotives that he would diversify into the steel, hardware, and construction material business before converting the company into a holding corporation that would, during Evans time, take over more than eighty U.S. companies.\n\nAmong his major acquisitions was the 1959 takeover of Crane Co. of Chicago, then a large valve and plumbing fixture manufacturer. In April 1959 Evans was appointed Chairman of the Board and Chief executive officer of the company.\n\nThe July 23, 2000, edition of the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" said that Thomas Mellon Evans was \"arguably one of the seminal figures of 20th-century business.\" Evans' story was told by Diana B. Henriques in her book \"The White Sharks of Wall Street: Thomas Mellon Evans and the Original Corporate Raiders\" published by Scribner in 2000 ( - Library of Congress Online Catalog).\n\nIn 1956, Evans bought a 495-acre cattle farm in Gainesville, Virginia, and converted it to a Thoroughbred breeding operation under the name Buckland Farm. The farm was managed and directed by Don M. Robertson, General Manager of the farm and a Vice President of its incorporation. Robertson, a Central Kentucky native whose family heritage consisted of a long line of excellent Thoroughbred horsemen, chose the matches between stallions and mares for Buckland Farm. It was Robertson who produced the winning bloodlines for the farm, including Pleasant Colony. During Evans' years in racing, trainers who conditioned his horses included John Campo, Angel Cordero Jr., Leroy Jolley, Ross Pearce, and Christopher Speckert.\n\nIn addition to Pleasant Colony, Thomas Evans owned a number of stakes winners including Pleasant Stage, winner of the 1991 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly, plus the 1992 American Champion Older Male Horse, Pleasant Tap.\n\nThomas Evans was a member of the Board of Directors of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame and a member of The Jockey Club, the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, and the Virginia Thoroughbred Association. In 1993, he was inducted into the Virginia Thoroughbred Association Hall of Fame.\n\nSons Edward and Robert became significant owners and/or breeders of Thoroughbred racehorses, with Robert owning the 2014 Belmont Stakes winner Tonalist.\n"}
