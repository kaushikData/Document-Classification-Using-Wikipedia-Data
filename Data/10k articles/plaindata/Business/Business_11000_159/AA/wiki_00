Work on the new structure began in 2016, and is expected to end in late 2019.\nL&L acquired the original structure on the site in 2002. The original building was constructed in the 1950s, and contained 33 floors. Due to zoning restrictions, the new structure will contain the same number of square feet as the previous one, and will incorporate some of the original structure into its base. Preserving the original structure led to difficulties during construction, requiring the developer to hire a third engineering firm. \n\nAs of April 2018, the building was halfway to its full height. Facade installation began in June 2018, when the building was 22 floors from topping out.\n\nKahn & Jacobs designed the original office building on the site. Modernist in style, it replaced a row of townhouses. It was one of the first modernist buildings on Park Avenue.\n\nBecause of zoning restrictions, a portion of the former structure was included in thew new one. L&L chose Foster + Partners to design the building after a competition to choose an architect. L&L solicited bids from 11 architectural firms. These entries were narrowed to four final proposals, from Zaha Hadid Architects, Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, OMA, and Foster + Partners. Each incorporated a portion of the original structure. Real estate news site \"YIMBY\" noted that, due to its three roughly 200-foot concrete fins, the Foster plan would have \"[...] the most pronounced skyline effect\" compared to the other proposals.\n\nLender HFF provided a $556 million construction loan.\n\nL&L intended not to pre-lease the building, but in early 2016, hedge fund Citadel signed a lease for 200,000 square feet across several floors, including the penthouse floor. At the time it was signed, it was the most expensive lease in the city's history. Delays in construction have led some to speculate that Citadel may back out of the lease, or that it was seeking temporary offices due to the delays. L&L has asserted that the tenant will move in as planned.\n\nThe founders of restaurant Eleven Madison will open two restaurants in the building, originally announced in 2015. One will be two stories tall, in the building's base, totaling roughly 14,000 square feet. According to L&L's founder, David Levinson, the intention is for the restaurant to be \"...a Four Seasons on steroids for the 21st century\". The other restaurant will be open only to tenants, and will be located on the 27th floor. Despite construction delays, both venues are still expected to open when construction is complete as of June 2018.\n\n"}

Because of the hill's excellent views of the Los Angeles Basin and the Los Angeles River, he knew that it would make for an opulent subdivision. He developed the peak of Bunker Hill with lavish two-story Victorian houses that became famous as homes for the upper-class residents of Los Angeles. Angels Flight, now dubbed \"The World's Shortest Railway\", took residents homeward from the bottom of the 33% grade and down again.\n\nInitially a residential suburb, Bunker Hill retained its exclusive character through the end of World War I, but in the face of increased urban growth fed by an extensive streetcar system, its wealthy residents began leaving for enclaves on the Westside and Pasadena. Bunker Hill's houses were increasingly subdivided to accommodate renters. Still, Bunker Hill was at this time \"Los Angeles's most crowded and urban neighborhood\". By World War II, the Pasadena Freeway, built to bring shoppers downtown, was taking more residents out. Additional postwar freeway construction left downtown comparatively empty of both people and services. The once-grand Victorian mansions of Bunker Hill became the home of impoverished pensioners.\n\nIn 1955, Los Angeles city planners decided that Bunker Hill required a massive slum clearance project. The top of Bunker Hill was cleared of its houses and then flattened as the first stage of the Bunker Hill Redevelopment Project to populate Bunker Hill with modern plazas and buildings. When the height limit of buildings for Los Angeles was finally raised (previously buildings were limited to 150 feet), developers built some of the tallest skyscrapers in the region to take advantage of the area's existing dense zoning. In approving such projects, the city sought to project a modern, sophisticated image.\n\nThe project is the longest redevelopment project in Los Angeles history. The majority of the skyscrapers on Bunker Hill were built in the 1980s, with a new skyscraper or two being finished nearly every year. However, the momentum died down in the 1990s, shortly after the 52-story Two California Plaza was finished. In 1999, the vacancy rate for downtown commercial skyscrapers was 26%, one of the highest in the nation for that time. Planned office towers were canceled, including California Plaza Three, and the nearby four-towered Metropolis (brought back to life in 2005).\n\nMany of the older buildings and the early high-rises surrounding Bunker Hill are undergoing adaptive reuse from commercial to residential. This trend began in 2000, when the Los Angeles City Council passed an adaptive reuse ordinance, allowing old unused office buildings to be redeveloped as apartments or \"lofts\". Developers realized there was a high level of pent-up demand for living in or near downtown by artists and employees of various firms in the Financial District and government workers in the Civic Center, and that they could profit by supplying housing to meet such demand.\n\nBecause of the popularity of the New Urbanism in California, the city has required developers to build mixed-use residential buildings as much as possible. This means that the first floor of such residential developments is devoted to commercial retailers, so that residents do not have to constantly drive around for all their shopping trips and buildings present a more welcoming facade to passersby on the sidewalk.\n\nContributing to the resurgence of Bunker Hill has been the construction of public venues, such as Walt Disney Concert Hall and Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, as well as the Colburn School, a community performing arts school and collegiate conservatory. \n\nIn February 2007, $2.05 billion was approved for the Grand Avenue Project, which over the next 10 years will bring in over 2,000 new residential units, over 400 of them being affordable units for all degrees of low-income families; a million square feet (93,000 m²) of office space; a Mandarin Oriental hotel; 600,000 square feet (56,000 m²) of retail and entertainment space; and the Grand Park, connecting City Hall to Bunker Hill. Office space and residential units will be in several skyscrapers ranging between 35-55 stories each. Nearby planned projects include L.A. Live on Figueroa Street and Olympic Boulevard in South Park (the southern end of the Bunker Hill area). A new major modern art museum, The Broad, opened on September 20, 2015, next to Disney Hall.\n\nThe Angels Flight tramway, which was rebuilt in 1996 near where it was originally located and shut down after a fatal accident in 2001, reopened on March 15, 2010, to provide a link between Bunker Hill and the revitalized downtown area. One sign of the success of the downtown renaissance is that the office vacancy rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 16%, compared to 19% for 2003, and 26% for 1999.\n\nWhile developers are primarily building market-rate housing on Bunker Hill today, the City of Los Angeles has very strict laws, rules, and ordinances established that promote the inclusion of all income levels into the residential mix. Some examples include incentives for the creation of affordable housing (rather than market-rate housing), the preservation of existing affordable housing, the development of affordable housing by the city itself (rather than waiting for private developers), and others. The city has written documentation regarding the development of affordable housing.\n\nOn the topic of building affordable housing for very low-income to moderate-income, Principal City Planner Jane Blumenfeld said, \"We are trying to make it attractive to build [downtown] and get this added affordable housing that we normally wouldn't have. We need an adequate amount of lower income housing so that in 20 years Downtown doesn't become an exclusive neighborhood.\"\n\nThe Emerson apartment building, owned by the Related Companies, has 271 units, of which 216 are leased at market rates. The other 55 units are at subsidized rates to tenants whose annual incomes are less than 50% of the local median, which was $42,700 for a family of four in 2014.\n\nOn \"The Adventures of Philip Marlowe\" radio program with episode named \"Baton Sinister\" dated September 17, 1949, Angels Flight is referenced as Marlowe has a rendezvous set in Bunker Hill.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Bunker Hill was a popular film setting, especially in the film noir genre, because of its Victorian homes, its rambling hillside apartments and flophouses, its Angels Flight funicular, and its mean (or at least mean-looking) streets. It was used extensively in such crime films as \"Cry Danger\" (1951), \"Kiss Me Deadly\" (1956), \"Criss Cross\" (1949), Joseph Losey's \"M\" (1951), and \"Angel's Flight\" (1965). \n\nDirector Curtis Hanson re-created Bunker Hill in another hilly neighborhood altogether in his Oscar Award–winning \"L.A. Confidential\" (1997). Kent Mackenzie made a film in 1956 called \"Bunker Hill\" about the displacement of the residents who had to make way for construction. Another film by Mackenzie that was set in the area —his neo-realist and semi-documentary feature \"The Exiles\" (1961) — depicts the lives of a tribe of urban Indians on Bunker Hill in the late 1950s.\n\nBunker Hill was a destination of many local artists and photographers, some in its heyday, others as it was being demolished and rebuilt. Among the latter was the Los Angeles photographer Ray McSavaney. \n\nAngels Flight and its Third Street neighborhood, c. 1930s, were re-created in South Africa for the filming of \"Ask the Dust\" (2006), based on the novel by John Fante, which was set in the district in the 1930s. Fante also wrote a book called \"Dreams From Bunker Hill,\" his last novel, dictated near death to his wife.\n\nThe 2nd Street Tunnel under Bunker Hill is widely used in film and advertising.\n\nBunker Hill is also the title of (and referenced in) the 1992 song from the \"Free-for-All\" album by Angeleno transplant Michael Penn and a B-side of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Jim Dawson's 2008 book \"Angels Flight\" includes several chapters, complete with many dozens of early photos, on Bunker Hill and its literary and film background.\n\nBunker Hill is the setting for much of Robin Robertson's 2018 verse narrative \"The Long Take\" which won the 2018 Goldsmiths Prize. The book includes a map of the old Bunker Hill neighbourhood.\n\nIt is represented in the 2013 video game \"Grand Theft Auto V\" as \"Pillbox Hill\" (\"Pillbox\" and \"Bunker\" being similar) in the game's rendition of Los Angeles as Los Santos.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department operates fire Station 3 (Civic Center/Bunker Hill) in the area.\n\nThe area is served by the Los Angeles USD.\n\n"}
{"id": "577440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577440", "title": "Busy work", "text": "Busy work\n\nBusy work (also referred to as make-work and busywork) can refer to activity that is undertaken to pass time and stay busy but in and of itself has no actual value. Busy work also occurs in business, military and other settings, in situations where people may be required to be present but may lack the opportunities, skills or need to do something more productive. People may engage in busy work to maintain an appearance of activity, in order to avoid criticism of being inactive or idle. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines busywork as \"work that usually appears productive or of intrinsic value but actually only keeps one occupied.\" \n\nIn the context of education, busy work allows students to work independently, to test their own knowledge and skills, and to practice using new skills learned in the educational setting. It can consist of various types of schoolwork assigned by a teacher to keep students occupied with activities involving learning and cognition while the teacher focuses upon another group of students. The functionality of busy work is associated with levels of interest students have with the content of the work, levels of enjoyment students have in performing the work, how purposeful the work is, and how accomplishment of the work is perceived by students. The perceived results of the work by students is significant: when students feel that they've succeeded in accomplishing a functional task, it's congruent with learning and the attainment of new skills.\n\nBusy work can also be used to keep the students occupied with educational tasks during idle times, such as instances when time in school remains but the day's curriculum has already concluded. This application of busy work to consume idle time was common in primary education, but the need for work to have educational content, rather than existing just to consume time, is now preferred.\n\nBusy work has historical precedent in primary education. Conditioning students to believe that busy work carries the same value as progressive work can lead to students maintaining this belief later in life, carrying it through to the workplace.\n\nIn business and work settings, people may engage in busy work simply to appear like they're being busy and productive, with the primary goal of actually simply maintaining an \"appearance\" of activity in efforts to protect their employment status (to avoid termination or sanctions). Workers believe that it is more important to maintain a constant appearance of working urgently so that they and others believe that what is being done is important. Constant urgency in workers can lead to disproportionate distribution of actual work, as workers may put off important work by attempting to complete previously-designated less important work. Maintaining very high levels of constant busyness may actually be detrimental to the operations of a business or organization in which new tasks are not undertaken in a timely manner because workers are always very busy. That can also lead to workers taking shortcuts to accomplish tasks more quickly, which can negatively affect the quality of work results. Busy work also can be counterproductive in work settings because it may not be aligned with the overall objectives and priorities of an organization's plans for attaining and maintaining success in its ventures. The assumption that activity in the workplace is more important than productivity in the workplace can lead to employees thinking that quantity of work is better than quality of work, which is not productive to the overall functioning of a business.\n\nBusy work is used in armed forces to keep servicemembers from becoming bored, inactive and idle. Tasks of this sort include drill, memorizing regulations, getting haircuts, spit and polishing footwear and other cleaning chores such as scrubbing the deck.\n\n\n\n"}

The awards were first presented in 1981, honoring the movies of the previous year. \"Talk Dirty to Me,\" a sex comedy starring John Leslie, who won Best Actor, was voted best film of 1980. Samantha Fox was the first Best Actress, winning for her role in \"This Lady Is A Tramp,\" another sex comedy.\n\n\"Amanda By Night\", an adult crime-drama and \"Roommates\", also a drama, would become CAFA's most-honored movies, with the latter being presented with seven awards in 1983, including Best Director (Chuck Vincent) and Best Actress (Veronica Hart). \"Amanda By Night\" scooped six awards the previous year in a ceremony \"held at the famed Copacabana\": Best Film, Best Actress (Hart), Best Supporting Actress (Lisa De Leeuw), Best Director (Robert McCallum), Best Screenplay and Best Editing.\n\nThe CAFA and Adult Film Association of America awards were considered the major adult film awards of the Golden Age of Porn. By 1985, sex news magazine \"Cheri\" declared: \"Held at the Silver Lining, a snazzy little bistro on the West Side's Restaurant Row, the fifth-annual Critics Adult Film Awards was a gentle reminder that porn films can be measured against standards other than the Peter Meter.\"\n\nThe seventh CAFA Awards were presented May 27, 1987 in Manhattan. The association seems to have faded away after that, as did the New York-based adult film industry, overtaken by the X-Rated Critics Organization and its Heart-On Awards, which had first been presented two years earlier and which were based in California, the new centre of porn production.\n\nIn 1986 all three awards programs chose the same Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actress.\n\nThe trophies were called the Critics Adult Film Award and each was inscribed with the year the award was being given for, on a gold-plated round icon with decorative edges on a wooden base.\n\nIn 1987, \"Cinema Blue\" magazine described the voting as a two-stage process: \"CAFA President Jack Shugg and officers Steffani Martin, Colette Connor and Will H. Jarvis, aided and abetted by the members of CAFA...mail out two ballots to the New York porn critics. On the first ballot, the critics make five choices for best movies and performers in each category. (This year, any film or video released between January 1, 1986 and February 28, 1987 was eligible.) The ballots are then mailed back and the officers and their assistants count them. The choices with the most votes are then listed on a second ballot and again mailed to the critics who make one final choice in each category. These votes are once again tabulated and the movie or performer in each category with the most votes becomes the winner.\"\n\nWinners are listed below by the year in which the awards presentation was held, not by year the award was for, which was the previous year.\n\nLike the Academy Awards, CAFA also honored the best in various production categories. For example, at the awards show held in 1985, \"Every Woman Has a Fantasy\" scooped up cinematography and music awards, \"Raw Talent\" polished off top honors for editing prowess and Sandy Amsterdam's production design and \"Talk DIrty to Me III\" netted make-up and costuming kudos for Traci Lords' mermaid tail.\n\nHowever, unlike the Academy Awards, CAFA also presented awards in categories specific to the pornographic movie industry, such as Best Group Scene, bestowed in 1987 to \"\" with Vanessa del Rio and seven studs. With the advent of pornography on video, a Best Adult Video award was created, won by Candida Royalle for \"Urban Heat\" in 1985 and \"Christine's Secret\" in 1987.\n\nThe annual Gerard Damiano Special Achievement Award, named after the producer, writer and director of the 1972 cult classic \"Deep Throat\", went to actress Georgina Spelvin in 1982, Erica Eaton, publicist and former CAFA chairperson, in 1985 and Gloria Leonard in 1987.\n\nThere is a discrepancy as to which movie(s) Tom Byron won for in 1985. \"Cheri\" magazine states \"He managed to walk off with Best Actor (for \"Sister Dearest\") and Best Supporting Actor (\"Talk Dirty To Me III\")\". Internet Adult Film Database founder Peter Van Aarle lists \"Private Teacher\" as his Best Actor win and \"Sister Dearest\" as his Best Supporting Actor award.\n\n"}

He defended prominent Filipinos accused of financially supporting the Katipunan.\n\nIn May 1898, Araneta was appointed member of the 21-man Consultative Assembly, which the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines Basilio Agustin formed in an attempt to rally Filipinos to the Spanish side of the Spanish–American War. This assembly, however, failed.\n\nAraneta participated in the drafting of the Malolos Constitution. He resigned as Secretary and accepted his appointment as Justice of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nOn January 25, 1899, the Diplomatic Corps of the First Philippine Republic was organized and Araneta was among those appointed as member but he chose to abandon the revolutionary government. Months after the Philippine–American War broke out, America established the civil courts in the Philippines. In May 1899, General Elwell Otis appointed Araneta as Associate Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court, the youngest to occupy the position at 30 years old. Araneta's sympathies became clearer when he joined the Federal Party that favored America’s annexation of the Philippines.\n\nOn June 15, 1901, he was appointed Solicitor General. When Attorney General Libbeus R. Wifley accepted a post in China, Araneta was made his successor. He took his oath of office as Attorney General on July 16, 1906.

He was the first Filipino to hold a sensitive post, being a commissioner with portfolio. He resigned from government service on October 10, 1913. With Salvador Zaragoza, he established a law office, which attracted many clients.\n\nDuring the first Senatorial election in 1916, he ran for a seat in the Senate but lost to Rafael Palma. That same year, he accepted a teaching post in the University of Santo Tomas and at the same attended to his private law practice. Araneta convinced the Supreme Court to reverse its previous decision on two cases. Araneta also gained respect for his ethical principles. He turned down the offer of House Speaker Sergio Osmeña to seat as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in favor of Manuel Araullo, who he thought to be more deserving for the post. He was again offered the same position during the time of Senate President Manuel Luis Quezon but he also declined, this time for \"delicadeza\", because he was then involved in a case pending before the Supreme Court.\n\nAraneta married Carmen Zaragoza y Rojas on March 7, 1896.

{"id": "1132349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1132349", "title": "Growth–share matrix", "text": "Growth–share matrix\n\nThe growth–share matrix (aka the product portfolio matrix, Boston Box, BCG-matrix, Boston matrix, Boston Consulting Group analysis, portfolio diagram) is a chart that was created by Bruce D. Henderson for the Boston Consulting Group in 1970 to help corporations to analyze their business units, that is, their product lines. This helps the company allocate resources and is used as an analytical tool in brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis. Some analysis of market performance by firms using its principles has called its usefulness into question.\n\nTo use the chart, analysts plot a scatter graph to rank the business units (or products) on the basis of their relative market shares and growth rates. \nAs a particular industry matures and its growth slows, all business units become either \"cash cows\" or \"dogs\". The natural cycle for most business units is that they start as \"question marks\", then turn into \"stars\". Eventually, the market stops growing; thus, the business unit becomes a \"cash cow\". At the end of the cycle, the cash cow turns into a \"dog\".\n\nAs BCG stated in 1970:\nOnly a diversified company with a balanced portfolio can use its strengths to truly capitalize on its growth opportunities. The balanced portfolio has:\n\"To be successful, a company should have a portfolio of products with different growth rates and different market shares. The portfolio composition is a function of the balance between cash flows. High growth products require cash inputs to grow. Low growth products should generate excess cash. Both kinds are needed simultaneously.\"—Bruce Henderson.\n\nFor each product or service, the 'area' of the circle represents the value of its sales. The growth–share matrix thus offers a \"map\" of the organization's product (or service) strengths and weaknesses, at least in terms of current profitability, as well as the likely cashflows.\n\nThe need which prompted this idea was, indeed, that of managing cash-flow. It was reasoned that one of the main indicators of cash generation was relative market share, and one which pointed to cash usage was that of market growth rate.\n\nThis indicates likely cash generation, because the higher the share the more cash will be generated. As a result of 'economies of scale' (a basic assumption of the BCG Matrix), it is assumed that these earnings will grow faster the higher the share. The exact measure is the brand's share relative to its largest competitor. Thus, if the brand had a share of 20 percent, and the largest competitor had the same, the ratio would be 1:1. If the largest competitor had a share of 60 percent, however, the ratio would be 1:3, implying that the organization's brand was in a relatively weak position. If the largest competitor only had a share of 5 percent, the ratio would be 4:1, implying that the brand owned was in a relatively strong position, which might be reflected in profits and cash flows. If this technique is used in practice, this scale is logarithmic, not linear.\n\nOn the other hand, exactly what is a high relative share is a matter of some debate. The best evidence is that the most stable position (at least in fast-moving consumer goods markets) is for the brand leader to have a share double that of the second brand, and triple that of the third. Brand leaders in this position tend to be very stable—and profitable; the Rule of 123.\n\nThe selection of the relative market share metric was based upon its relationship to the experience curve. The market leader would have greater experience curve benefits, which delivers a cost leadership advantage.\n\nAnother reason for choosing relative market share, rather than just profits, is that it carries more information than just cash flow. It shows where the brand is positioned against its main competitors, and indicates where it might be likely to go in the future. It can also show what type of marketing activities might be expected to be effective. \n\nRapidly growing in rapidly growing markets, are what organizations strive for; but, as we have seen, the penalty is that they are usually net cash users – they require investment. The reason for this is often because the growth is being 'bought' by the high investment, in the reasonable expectation that a high market share will eventually turn into a sound investment in future profits. The theory behind the matrix assumes, therefore, that a higher growth rate is indicative of accompanying demands on investment. The cut-off point is usually chosen as 10 per cent per annum. Determining this cut-off point, the rate above which the growth is deemed to be significant (and likely to lead to extra demands on cash) is a critical requirement of the technique; and one that, again, makes the use of the growth–share matrix problematical in some product areas. What is more, the evidence, from fast-moving consumer goods markets at least, is that the most typical pattern is of very low growth, less than 1 per cent per annum. This is outside the range normally considered in BCG Matrix work, which may make application of this form of analysis unworkable in many markets. \nWhere it can be applied, however, the market growth rate says more about the brand position than just its cash flow. It is a good indicator of that market's strength, of its future potential (of its 'maturity' in terms of the market life-cycle), and also of its attractiveness to future competitors. It can also be used in growth analysis.\n\nWhile theoretically useful, and widely used, several academic studies have called into question whether using the growth–share matrix actually helps businesses succeed, and the model has since been removed from some major marketing textbooks. One study (Slater and Zwirlein, 1992) which looked at 129 firms found that those who follow portfolio planning models like the BCG matrix had lower shareholder returns.\n\nThere are further criticisms to the B.C.G Matrix. The Matrix assumes that dogs have low market share and relatively low market growth rate. This can be challenged as there are several dogs on the market which are very profitable and retain significant market share. BIC razor blades are a modern day example. BIC Razor Blades cost the firm an average of £0.05 to produce and have a retail selling price of £2.43. This market is to expand by 25% annually for the next 5 years. This demonstrates how the B.C.G Matrix contradicts itself as a dog with little cash usage has considerably high market share within the market.\n\nAs originally practiced by the Boston Consulting Group, the matrix was used in situations where it could be applied for graphically illustrating a portfolio composition as a function of the balance between cash flows. If used with this degree of sophistication its use would still be valid. However, later practitioners have tended to over-simplify its messages. In particular, the later application of the names (problem children, stars, cash cows and dogs) has tended to overshadow all else—and is often what most students, and practitioners, remember.\n\nThis is unfortunate, since such simplistic use contains at least two major problems:\n\n\nPerhaps the most important danger is, however, that the apparent implication of its four-quadrant form is that there should be balance of products or services across all four quadrants; and that is, indeed, the main message that it is intended to convey. Thus, money must be diverted from 'cash cows' to fund the 'stars' of the future, since 'cash cows' will inevitably decline to become 'dogs'. There is an almost mesmeric inevitability about the whole process. It focuses attention, and funding, on to the 'stars'. It presumes, and almost demands, that 'cash cows' will turn into 'dogs'.\nThe reality is that it is only the 'cash cows' that are really important—all the other elements are supporting actors. It is a foolish vendor who diverts funds from a 'cash cow' when these are needed to extend the life of that 'product'. Although it is necessary to recognize a 'dog' when it appears (at least before it bites you) it would be foolish in the extreme to create one in order to balance up the picture. The vendor, who has most of his (or her) products in the 'cash cow' quadrant, should consider himself (or herself) fortunate indeed, and an excellent marketer, although he or she might also consider creating a few stars as an insurance policy against unexpected future developments and, perhaps, to add some extra growth. There is also a common misconception that 'dogs' are a waste of resources. In many markets 'dogs' can be considered loss-leaders that while not themselves profitable will lead to increased sales in other profitable areas.\n\nAs with most marketing techniques, there are a number of alternative offerings vying with the growth–share matrix although this appears to be the most widely used. The next most widely reported technique is that developed by McKinsey and General Electric, which is a three-cell by three-cell matrix—using the dimensions of 'industry attractiveness' and 'business strengths'. This approaches some of the same issues as the growth–share matrix but from a different direction and in a more complex way (which may be why it is used less, or is at least less widely taught). A more practical approach is that of the Boston Consulting Group's Advantage Matrix, which the consultancy reportedly used itself though it is little known amongst the wider population.\n\nThe initial intent of the growth–share matrix was to evaluate business units, but the same evaluation can be made for product lines or any other cash-generating entities. This should only be attempted for real lines that have a sufficient history to allow some prediction; if the corporation has made only a few products and called them a product line, the sample variance will be too high for this sort of analysis to be meaningful.\n"}

Amongst his notable clients were James Garner and Clint Eastwood. He was arguably the most responsible for launching Eastwood's career in the late 1950s and 1960s and whom Eastwood described as being \"like a second father to me\". Leonard, described by Richard Schickel as \"a small fastidious man\" and a \"lightning calculator\", closely advised Eastwood on his finances, career moves and even personal purchases such as cars and houses, right from the mid-1950s through to their planning of the film \"Play Misty for Me\" in the winter of his death in 1969, Eastwood's directorial debut.

He is the chairman of the rugby league club Huddersfield Giants and former chairman of Premier League football club Huddersfield Town.\n\nDavy grew up in Filey on the East Coast of Yorkshire. He left school at 15 with no academic qualifications and worked as a photographer for P&O. At 21 he set up a commercial photography business in Huddersfield before joining Abbey Life in 1971. In 1979 he formed the independent financial advice company DBS, which he sold in June 2001, for £75 million. In 2003, he set up SimplyBiz, providing development, research and marketing services to financial advisers.\n\nIn 2011, he gave his views on the changes happening in the financial services industry \"Restricted advice will prove much less attractive than many organisations believe. I can see why life insurers would be attracted to it, because it is a way of increasing their profits, but it does nothing for consumers or advisers.\" However, he later launched a national Restricted (rather than Independent) advice firm - \"Sandringham Partners\" in 2012, backed by £2m from SimplyBiz.\n\nIn 1996, Davy took over as chairman of Huddersfield Giants rugby league club. In 1999, he merged Huddersfield Giants with Sheffield Eagles, a move which resulted in the formation of the Huddersfield-Sheffield Giants. It was an unpopular move with supporters, and after one season the club reverted to being the Huddersfield Giants.\n\nDuring Davy's chairmanship Huddersfield Giants played St. Helens in the 2006 Challenge Cup Final at Twickenham Stadium, London. It was the first time that the Giants had reached the final since 1962. Also during Davy's chairmanship, Giants won the League Leaders Shield for the first time in 81 years, after a 40-0 victory over Wakefield Trinity Wildcats.\n\nDavy led the successful consortium, out of three interested, that took over Huddersfield Town in 2003, when they were in administration following the collapse of ITV Digital and Town's recent relegation to the Football League's bottom tier. As part of the takeover Huddersfield Town's 40% share in the ground was transferred to a holding company, Huddersfield Sporting Pride Ltd. Huddersfield Sporting Pride Ltd holds a 60% stake in the Huddersfield ground with the combined original stakes of the football and rugby club, the other 40% stake is owned by Kirklees Council.\n\nIn September 2006, he was criticised for failing to offer Town a significant transfer budget for the 2006–07 season to enable the club to build on their play-off position of the previous season. The budget, which was unspecified, was (according to former manager Peter Jackson) already used up on signing just two players, goalkeeper Matt Glennon and striker Luke Beckett despite the release of several players. However, Davy stated that Jackson was given the opportunity to strengthen his squad in order to mount a drive for promotion. This was not utilised and Jackson's \"inability to attract key players\" was one of the reasons given by Davy for the manager's dismissal.\n\nAfter Huddersfield's 2–3 loss to Yeovil Town on 16 September 2006, he addressed a peaceful demonstration of around 100 Town fans who had called for him to up the transfer budget or go, because of Town's poor start to the season in Football League One, in which they only picked up nine points from the first nine games.\n\nOn 3 June 2009, he handed over the chairmanship to Dean Hoyle and, after a brief period of retaining a minority shareholding, relinquished all ownership in Huddersfield Town.\n\nHe has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Business Administration from the University of Huddersfield and an Honorary Fellowship of the Chartered Insurance Institute.\n"}

{"id": "10835639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10835639", "title": "Marketing research mix", "text": "Marketing research mix\n\nThe term Marketing research mix (or the \"MR Mix\") was created in 2004 and published in 2007 (Bradley - see references). It was designed as a framework to assist researchers to design or evaluate marketing research studies. The name was deliberately chosen to be similar to the Marketing Mix - it also has four Ps. Unlike the marketing mix these elements are sequential and they match the main phases that need to be followed. These four Ps are: Purpose; Population; Procedure and Publication.\n\nThe purpose of the research is the reason why it is being done. The word “purpose” is useful because it has a wide coverage. It can be specifically defined or it can be loosely explained. The wide term also embraces studies to gather marketing intelligence, where the manager’s role is to scan the environment for useful data, and there may be no specific objective.\n\nMany marketers avoid the term hypothesis entirely and tend to use the words “research objective” or “aim”. The word hypothesis (plural, hypotheses) is quite different from the terms mentioned above. It is an essential starting point for quantitative researchers, but takes a lesser role for qualitative researchers. The term is deeply rooted in the history of scientific thought. In statistics we expend much time and energy to generate hypotheses, to test hypotheses, and to reject them. Some people argue that we should only test one hypothesis; others say we should test several. In hypothesis testing we create a statement, which may be true or false, this statement is a \"proposition\" - we propose that something may be the case. If it is right then we accept it. If it is not right, if it is \"wrong\" then we reject it.\n\nThe first step is to formulate the null-hypothesis, abbreviated to Ho. This is usually intended to be rejected. Another carefully constructed hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis or the H1; this is actually called the 'research hypothesis'. After these have been articulated the researcher can design a research programme to test the hypotheses. When the results are received, they are examined against the prediction of the null hypothesis. The basic idea is to use this possible explanation and then look for data to support the explanation (or not). It is best to spend as much time as possible on the hypothesis: it is the research question, and it determines how the study is carried out. It determines the design because it defines the problem.\n\nThe subject of hypothesis testing has been debated heavily for many years and there are suggestions that misuse of null hypothesis significance testing is widespread and damaging (Finch et al. 2001), at least in psychological research. It is relevant to cite an article on hypothesis testing in marketing research by Lawrence (1982) who tells us: \"Practical survey researchers (realise) that, in many cases, no adequate theory exists for setting up hypotheses in advance\". The article continues: \"Drawing one-off hypotheses out of the air offers no solution to the problem. Researchers will be guided by their own ideas, experiences, hunches\".\n\nWhen considering any market sector we need to ask “Who is involved in this marketplace?” Who are the players? Who should be the centre of the investigation and where are those subjects? This area considers the target audience, customer or player; the users or non-users. Who will become the respondent or informant? Should we contact all players or just some of them? Should we carry out a census or a sample: should respondents be selected by probability or non-probability methods? An important concept for primary research is sampling. We choose to interview or observe people who we think will give us the information that will solve our problems. So in choosing our research method, we need to consider whom we select and how we select. This applies to qualitative research, with only a few people, and quantitative research with many people. Much emphasis in marketing research is on the end user, but “experts” can bridge the gap between primary and secondary data. An expert may be someone who has been in the business for many years. This part of the MR Mix involves identifying relevant sampling frames.\n\nWhen considering the procedure the key question is “How should the study be conducted?” Will it be qualitative or quantitative? This area also covers the question of timing: when will the fieldwork take place?\n\nThe best research starts by looking at secondary data, this information already exists. The two basic sources: internal (within an organisation) and external, published by someone outside have become easier to access in recent years. Information Technology, with Intranets and the Internet, has improved our ability to find such data. If secondary data doesn’t solve the problem then original data (primary data) is sought. It is useful to think of different primary methods in these terms: we can ask people what they are doing; we can watch them or detect what they have done by counting or we can manipulate some variables to discover the effect. This creates three categories: questioning; observation and experimentation.\n\nPrimary data collection techniques can be subdivided into: interviewer-administered or respondent-administered; direct or indirect; personal or impersonal. Processing data, analysis and interpretation are essential parts of the procedure. Detailed examination of the appropriate tools used in the data collection needs to take place.\n\nUnder the heading of “Publication” the key questions are: Who is the audience for the results? What should be communicated? When and how should they be communicated? Research is of no use if findings are kept within the research team; similarly commercially sensitive information will have no competitive advantage if placed in the public domain. Choices need to be made on how publication takes place. Will a written report be created? Will tabulations be provided? Will a personal presentation take place? Who should be allowed sight of the results?\n\nThere are many different readers of research reports and these audiences all have very different expectations. Reporting must be personalised, writing and presentation style must be customised and adapted to the user. At one extreme there is the general public. There are many reasons why research is reported to the “mass consumer”. It may be a government report that has been commissioned to be in the public interest: concerning health, welfare, transport and so on. It may be a consumer report: consumer watchdog reports are of great interest to the man on the street, so we find the Which? Magazine and similar bodies have enabled the layman appreciate survey findings. Editors of periodicals regularly commission research for editorial reasons, so the results may become part of an article for mass consumption. The research agency may report directly to the public on web pages, by email or by post, this is because it is now common to offer a short summary report to a respondent as a gesture of goodwill, an incentive, a thank you for co-operating in the research. Research findings may appear as part of a promotional campaign, appealing to the consumer’s need to know that indeed this is a best seller (“nine out of ten cat-owners prefer…”).\n\nThen there are smaller audiences such as managers who are anxious to receive a report in order to make instant decisions. Additionally there are managers who will benefit from the information much later when the report is consulted as secondary data in the future.\n\n\n"}

Predating the launch of the originally similar ESPNews by three years, it focused on 24-hour coverage of sports news and analysis.\n\nNewSport debuted on October 1, 1993, replacing SportsChannel America, a national version spun off of Rainbow's SportsChannel regional sports network group. NewSport developed a unique sports ticker, known as the \"NewSport Score Box\", which debuted in 1995 and provided constantly updated score information on ongoing games and schedules for upcoming sports events at the bottom right of the screen.\n\nThe network also aired original programs such as \"NewSport Talk\" (a sports discussion program), \"NewSport Journal\", \"NewSport Tonite\" (a nightly program featuring news and analysis on the day in sports) and \"Scoreboard Central\" (which premiered on April 29, 1995, a 12-hour sports news program that aired on Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time).\n\nThe network was slow to grow in coverage, with relatively limited carriage on cable system operators besides Cablevision, owner of SportsChannel and NewSport parent Rainbow Media. Ironically, even Cablevision did not give the network full-time coverage as it carried NewSport on the channel slots also occupied by The Weather Channel on some of their systems through a time-share arrangement. At its peak, NewSport had only about 10 million subscribers nationwide. This slow growth and lack of viewers, combined with the wide distribution and success of ESPNEWS and Rainbow reportedly losing more than $20 million operating the network, resulted in Rainbow Programming Holdings deciding to shut down NewSport on July 9, 1997.\n\nAmerican Sports Classics is a network that focused on sports nostalgia programming; it was originally set to launch after NewSport ceased operations on July 9, 1997, however its launch was postponed \"indefinitely\" for a time, after Rainbow Media transferred control of the network to Fox/Liberty Networks, a joint venture between News Corporation, Liberty Media and Cablevision created after News Corporation acquired a 40% stake in Cablevision's sports properties for $850 million in June 1997. When it launched that fall, the network featured a broad mix of biographical and magazine-style programs.\n\nASC's format contrasted with the similarly focused Classic Sports Network (which later became ESPN Classic), which at the time mostly showed archived sports event telecasts. Indeed, the reason why the launch was postponed in the first place was due to problems Rainbow faced in trying to obtain the rebroadcast rights to sporting events from the major professional and collegiate sports leagues or their broadcast partners, forcing American Sports Classics to rely on the magazine and biographical programs. Like NewSport, ASC was unable to stand up to its competitors, specifically Classic Sports Network.

It sought to create a forum for discussing economic inequality at Harvard, in the United States, and throughout the world. It criticized Harvard's influence on global economic policy and its involvement with the American financial sector. It also supported wage campaigns by Harvard workers and a divestment demand initiated by Hotel Workers Rising.\n\nFacing resistance from administration and police, the group established an encampment in Harvard Yard after a march on November 9, 2011. Immediately after this march, the gates to Harvard Yard were locked and only people with Harvard identity cards were allowed through. Although the encampment gained many faculty supporters, it was not popular among Harvard undergraduates. The security checkpoints were not removed until after the group packed up its tents in December 2011. Occupy Harvard continued to organize into 2012, with a focus on the university's library system.\n\nThe demonstration raised issues of privilege and economic inequality, particularly as they relate to students and administration at one of the world's wealthiest and best-known universities. Supporters described Occupy Harvard as a \"fight for Harvard's soul\", questioning whether the university would \"continue to prioritize money above social justice\". Opponents called the demonstrators over-privileged and under-informed attention seekers.\n\nHarvard University is one of the most exclusive universities in the world, with an admission rate of 5.9%. Harvard is famous for its wealthy graduates but also for its generous financial aid programs. Its financial endowment of over $30 billion, on which it does not pay taxes, is the largest in the world. It is one of the world's richest non-profits, competing only with the Catholic Church (and perhaps the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation).\n\nMany Harvard graduates work in the financial sector based on Wall Street; many others hold prominent positions in the world of business. Prominent faculty such as former president Larry Summers—who become director of the National Economic Council under Obama—have played major roles in shaping United States economic policy. This status has led critics to connect Harvard closely with America's domestic and international economic policies. Harvard's investments have also come under scrutiny (as they did during divestment campaigns targeting apartheid in South Africa), with particular criticism leveled at holdings in HEI Hotels & Resorts.\n\nHarvard has been the site of workers' campaigns, notably the long-term Harvard Living Wage Campaign which peaked in 2001. This movement—which established an open 100-tent shantytown in Harvard Yard—won concessions from Harvard including the formation of a jobs committee and a moratorium on outsourcing. \nIn general, student activism at Harvard is limited to official channels. Although many Harvard students are involved in community service or public policy, these avenues for change have been criticized (in the words of a queer student activist at Harvard) as \"technocratic,\" and oriented towards \"research solutions, policy solutions, economic solutions, bureaucratic solutions to all problems rather than any type of social movement.\" Another student said, \"It’s uncomfortable to acknowledge one’s own privilege and position—it can feel like a personal attack.\"\n\nOccupy Wall Street (itself inspired by the Arab Spring began on September 17, 2011, sparking a wave of public encampments that came to be known as the Occupy Movement. Students at Harvard began organizing in response to that movement, and began to collaborate with the Occupy Boston encampment established on September 30, 2011. Harvard workers, many of them members of Local 615 (SEIU) and Local 26 (UNITE HERE!), also joined with Occupy Boston and helped to plan Occupy Harvard. The \"Harvard Crimson\" generally opposed the Occupy actions, and defended police officers who arrested Harvard students at Occupy Boston.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 2, 2011, about 70 students walked out of Economics 10 (\"Ec 10\"), Harvard's introductory economics class taught by N. Gregory Mankiw, former economic advisor to George W. Bush and then-current advisor to Mitt Romney. Demonstrators expressed support for Occupy Wall Street and published an open letter to Mankiw:\n\nThe letter criticized Mankiw's class specifically for presenting a conservative perspective as absolute truth, and for excluding academic data and primary sources (relying heavily, instead on Mankiw's own textbook). Students cited, for example, Mankiw's claim that economics dictated a zero-sum relationship between economic efficiency and economic equality. The walkout immediately produced heated debate about Harvard and Ec 10, in particular the question of whether the class really separates \"descriptive\" from \"normative\" claims. An Occupy organizer who supported the walkout said that the class promotes a \"strongly conservative neoliberal ideology\"; the secretary for the Harvard Republican Club said that \"the class is about pure economic efficiency. Ideology comes into play when we determine how to balance efficiency with social equity.\"\n\nMankiw said that his course was a \"relatively apolitical\" introduction to economics, that he was planning to teach a lecture on inequality, a topic that might interest the protestors, and that he could \"understand their desire to think about alternative ways to structure society.\"\n\nOn November 9, 2011, hundreds of demonstrators (estimates range between 300 and 500; not all of them Harvard students) met at Harvard Law School and marched toward Harvard Yard. After allowing through some students with identity cards, Harvard Police closed the gates on all of the protestors. Some reported police roughness and minor injuries. Those who entered the Yard set up tents that had been stored previously in nearby dormitories, establishing a camp near the Yard's John Harvard statue.\n\nThe next morning (November 10), the group issued an official statement which included specific criticisms of Harvard management:\n\nWe see injustice in the 180:1 ratio between the compensation of Harvard’s highest-paid employee—the head of internal investments at Harvard Management Company—and the lowest-paid employee, an entry-level custodial worker. We see injustice in Harvard’s adoption of corporate efficiency measures such as job outsourcing. We see injustice in African land grabs that displace local farmers and devastate the environment. We see injustice in Harvard’s investment in private equity firms such as HEI Hotels and Resorts, which profits off the backbreaking labor of a non-union immigrant workforce. We see injustice in Harvard’s lack of financial transparency and its prevention of student and community voice in these investments.\nThe group also announced that it would make policies through a regular General Assembly.\n\nWhile the tents were standing, Harvard administrators kept the gates locked—during this time, no one was allowed into Harvard Yard without appropriate identification. A November 14 statement attributed this decision to \"health and safety issues that have arisen elsewhere.\" Those who held Occupy Harvard responsible for the locked gate maintained that it was necessary to prevent the mayhem (rape, assault, drugs, and more) that occurred at other Occupy encampments. With the gates closed and attendance restricted to Harvard students, the Occupy Harvard encampment may have been one of the most orderly and polite in the nation. According to reporter John Stephen Dwyer:\n\nThe shutting of Harvard’s gates has determined the character of the protest and the criticism made against it. Whereas Occupy Boston has attracted all kinds of wild characters, the atmosphere at Occupy Harvard is calm and polite. The occupiers are almost invariably well-groomed and articulate. The donation jar took in $130 one day, most of it in $20 bills, and it didn’t disappear when no one had their eye on it. <br> It is, to use a word popular in Dewey Square, \"bougy\" (fancy, bourgeois). Many holders of Harvard IDs have a decent shot of joining the 1% if they weren’t already born into it. The occupiers in the Yard say this privilege – earned through hard work in many cases, inherited in others – gives them more obligation to try to fix the system rather than less.\nSupporters of the demonstration criticized the gate closure, saying that the administration was reinforcing its elitist image and \"shutting down\" the university by preventing free flow of people and dialogue. Faculty supporters published open letters to Harvard President Drew Faust asking her to reopen the gates. One group of professors connected to Romance Language programs at Harvard wrote:\n\nWe sympathize with your difficult position, but all of us agree that locking the gates is contrary to the principle of open inquiry for which the university stands. Historically, Harvard has never locked its gates (at least, not in recent memory), and we believe that security issues can be addressed differently. We do not share the perception that the Occupy movement constitutes a threat to Harvard. To the contrary, we are in sympathy with protests against increasing inequality in the United States and believe that Harvard should welcome discussions of the issue.\n\nLaw professor Duncan Kennedy said that \"the massive security presence, albeit friendly enough, had a Homeland Security feel to it.\" Francis Xavier Clooney, a Jesuit priest at Harvard Divinity School, described the demonstration as a \"Vigil\" and called the security \"unduly strict, disproportionate, unnecessary\". To the irritation of students opposed to the demonstration, some professors held classes outside the gates to protest their closure. Many students, tourists, and local businesses complained about the gates, which were locked for a month and a half. Relatives of students and members of the press were also excluded.\n\nThe tents themselves served what organizers called a \"symbolic\" role, since members of Occupy Harvard continued attending school and work during the encampment. Some students criticized participants for not being present with the tents. (Many students themselves felt conflicted about competing obligations to the demonstration and to their academic work.) The tents were reportedly purchased with funds from the Student Labor Action Coalition, and the Service Employees International Union. The occupation consisted of 30 tents and a core group of 100 activists at Harvard.\n\nMembers of Occupy Harvard used the encampment as a platform to create discussion about the university and its role in the world. Many criticized Harvard's role in the global economy (and crisis therein): \"Year after year, Harvard supplies traders and analysts and financial advisers who go on to run the economy into the ground\", said one participating graduate student. Occupiers also criticized finances within the university. Said one doctoral student studying slavery, \"I am grateful for what the school has given me, but the lack of transparency about where all that lovely money comes from is something I do not feel comfortable with.\"\n\nA constant theme, connected to the broader Occupy slogan of \"people over profits\", was the desire for Harvard to prioritize educating the populace above money. One post-doc said that Occupy Harvard's \"goal is to reaffirm Harvard as a marketplace of ideas where all viewpoints are discussed and analyzed without regard to the amount of money supporting the different ideas.\"\" When journalist Chris Hedges addressed the group (outside the gates, so that others could attend), he stressed the symbolic importance of Occupy Harvard to a larger struggle against plutocracy.\n\nOn Monday, December 12, 2011, Occupy Harvard chose to strike its Harvard Yard camp, citing winter weather and a desire for the Yard's gates to reopen. Harvard Yard was reopened—during daytime hours—on December 22, 2011.\n\nThe group maintained its information tent, a single weather-proof dome, until administrators ordered the structure removed on Friday, January 13, 2012. A \"crafts working group\" created miniature tents out of paper to display on the site.\n\nOccupy Harvard denounced finance industry, which it described as bad for the economy and a source of inequality. Campus opposition to corporate recruiting has increased, with some describing it as similar to military recruiting. Recent declines in recruitment rates for the finance sector have been attributed partly to the growing sense that these jobs are undesirable and unethical.\n\nOn Monday, November 28, 2011, Occupy Harvard conducted a \"Rally to Defend Freedom of Speech\" in Harvard Yard. The group expressed solidarity with UC Berkeley and UC Davis, where students had recently come into conflict with police. About 25 of the demonstrators proceeded from the Yard to a Goldman Sachs recruiting session, behind held at Harvard's \"On-Campus Interview Facility\". They stood outside and chanted \"Goldman Sachs, you can't hide / We can see your greedy side!\" Students who attempted to enter were denied access to the building by Harvard Police and Office of Career Services officials, even after showing identity cards.\n\nGoldman Sachs canceled recruiting events scheduled for December 8, 2012, reportedly in response to the demonstration. \"The Crimson\" criticized the demonstrators for singling out Goldman Sachs and for attempting to create animosity towards their peers bound for jobs in finance.\n\nThe group supported Harvard janitors in their campaign better wages, citing the discrepancy between pay for janitors and pay for Harvard's administrators. The janitors, unionized with SEIU Local 615, credited the Occupy group helping them to win a stronger five-year contract. The \"Crimson\" approved the new contract but criticized Occupy Harvard for \"attempting to link local and global issues\", writing that \"discussing the custodians' contract in the context of the global Occupy movement seems misguided.\"\n\nOn November 18, Occupy Harvard and Occupy Boston disrupted a speech by Newt Gingrich (then a presidential candidate) at the Kennedy School of Government. Gingrich was presenting his film \"A City Upon A Hill: The Spirit of American Exceptionalism\", sponsored by Citizens United Productions, made famous by the Supreme Court's 2009 Citizens United ruling. Soon after Gingrich began to speak, demonstrators in the audience said \"Thank you for standing up for corporations. They have rights too!\" and \"We are the 99 percent!\" before being removed by security. Gingrich responded \"I think we are 100 percent. We are all Americans. Gingrich suggested later in his speech that janitors should not be members of unions, and that their jobs should be given to children living in poverty.\n\nThe group also joined with the Hotel Workers Rising campaign, pressuring Harvard to divest its holdings in HEI Hotels & Resorts. In December 2011, Harvard agreed to review its holdings in HEI—in March 2012, it agreed to divest.\n\nIn early 2012, Harvard announced imminent sweeping changes to its library system. These changes would have led to layoffs, as well as cuts in other library resources. Library workers, members of the Harvard Union of Clerical & Technical Workers (HUCTW), reacted in January with protests, with occupiers distributing petitions in support. Protestors asked leaders HUCTW, historically not an aggressive union, to back the endangered workers.\n\nIn February, three members of Occupy Harvard published a statement in \"The Crimson\" describing an ongoing forum, held in Lamont Library, to discuss the course of these changes. (This editorial parodied the official statement of President Drew Faust on the library reorganization.):\n\nAs the Harvard community confronts this transition, the New Harvard Library Working Group of Occupy Harvard has acted autonomously to open a persistent community space for critical thought, engaged learning, and insistent action in the Lamont Library Café. In doing so, we strive to fulfill the promise of this library space as an open and participatory forum for learning. […]\nWe think of the proposed Harvard library transition as a manifestation of the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.\nWe insist on an alternative vision, one that cherishes the human communities and collaborative processes that make intellectual and civic engagement—on campuses and in public parks—not only possible but also fruitful. In Lamont Library, we are creating a community of knowledge sharing that is open, horizontal, and free from the destructive impulses that too often guide our university and that seem to be shaping the library transition.\nThe group announced intentions to hold Think Tanks and other meetings in the library from Sunday February 12 through Friday February 17. A major theme of the protests, was again the relationship of money to values. Topics included privatization and the larger economic ideology of neoliberalism, which occupiers said interfered with freedom and openness of education and libraries.\n\nAdministrators sought to remove Occupy Harvard from the library, threatening to revoke library access for participating students. Participants, instructed to take down signs because they violated an unwritten library policy, argued that the signs were protected by written library policy defending free speech. Police removed the protestors' signs, but did not ban anyone from the library. Harvard students quoted in the \"Crimson\" said that they were not bothered by the group and in some cases did not notice its presence.\n\nThe group held a rally outside of Lamont on Friday September 17, 2012, announcing support for library workers, holding signs, and chanting (e.g., \"Hey, Harvard, you can't hide / We can see your greedy side!\") Occupiers inside the library left the same day, as planned. Demonstrations around Harvard's libraries and library workers continued through Commencement 2012.\n\nOccupy Harvard received praise and criticism in \"The Harvard Crimson\". The \"Crimson\" itself opposed the encampment and published numerous editorials urging the group to move out of Harvard Yard. Contentious issues included the possible hypocrisy of privileged Harvard students, wastefulness of the tents, and, most of all, inconvenience created by the locked gates. The \"Crimson\" also cited the possibility of anarchist violence. An editorial published by Harvard graduate Alexandra Petri (class of 2010) in the \"Washington Post\" argued that the protestors were motivated not by an authentic desire for justice but instead by need to alleviate their own feelings of elitism and guilt—urging them to \"go to class\" and learn something while at Harvard.\n\nThe demonstrations raised questions for Harvard students about their own role in the nation's economic elite—the so-called \"1%\". Even participants struggled with the question of how Harvard students could authentically express solidarity with the downtrodden of the world. Students deliberated over the effects of Harvard's comprehensive financial aid policies. Neal Gabler wrote in the \"New York Times\" that Harvard students were \"superachivers\", even considering the effects of financial aid. They were \"likely to be wealthy, well-appointed young people groomed and professionalized at an early age precisely so they would impress admissions officers.\" One Harvard graduate who had already joined Occupy Boston told the \"Boston Globe\" that attending Harvard did not ensure membership in the 1%, saying: \"I’m the first person in my family to go to college, and I worked hard to go to Harvard, but I feel that the way the country is now, the American dream isn’t possible.’\" Some students in a dormitory near the encampment responded directly, chanting \"We are the one percent\" and yelling insults.\n\nA survey conducted by students in Statistics 104 suggested that student approval of Occupy Harvard averaged 2.85 on a scale of 1–10. A petition titled \"Free Harvard\", which asked the occupiers to go somewhere else in order to have the Harvard Yard gates reopened, obtained 700 signatures. (Occupiers complained that the University had managed to blame demonstrations for the administration's own decision to lock the gates.) Other students expressed confusion or curiosity about the purpose of the encampment. 70 faculty members signed letters of support for the demonstration.\n\nThe group also provoked response from within. Many said it was a good first step in creating awareness about global economic issues, and creating drama and emotion around political issues (particularly as contrasted with Harvard's Institute of Politics). Others said that it picked up on struggles that already had momentum—for example, HEI divestment, which was already being championed by the Student Labor Action Movement. They stressed the importance but also the difficulty of raising awareness about economic injustice at a school for the wealthy and privileged. Some felt that the process was dominated by graduate students, particularly in its \"2.0\" phase that focused on the libraries. Some participants were already familiar with consensus decision-making; others were new—to its pitfalls as well as to its advantages. One student criticized Occupy Harvard for being too cautious: \"Occupy Harvard is so different from the activism I’ve done in Oakland. In Oakland people don’t hesitate to strike, they don’t hesitate to do radical stuff. Here we need to discuss every nuance before we act. I’ve had to adjust my style and be more patient.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They operated the Cornwall Ironworks, making significant contributions to the American Revolutionary War effort.\n\nThe brothers inherited the ironworks from their father in 1754, with Peter, as the youngest, receiving only a one-third interest. They took over operation of the ironworks about 1765 and expanded it successfully. Peter, who had more ironmaking experience, took over the nearby Hopewell Forges, making bar iron from pig iron produced by Curtis at Cornwall Furnace. They operated the business through and after the Revolution, becoming quite prosperous until they died, Peter in 1786 and Curtis in 1789.\n\nMost of the Cornwall Ironworks fell out of family hands during the period 1783 - 1802, to Robert Coleman who became Pennsylvania's first millionaire. But a portion remained with Peter Jr.'s heirs, who added to it to become major Pennsylvania producers of iron in the mid-19th century, operating out of Mount Hope Estate.\n\nThe Grubb brothers were major contributors to the Revolutionary War effort, their Cornwall Ironworks supplied cannon, ammunition, shot and saltpans (used to make salt from seawater) to the Colonial forces. George Washington personally visited Cornwall to inspect the facility. Both brothers were elected as militia colonels, Peter's unit was the 8th Lancaster Battalion and Curtis' was the 2nd Lancaster Battalion, both assigned to the Flying Camp.\n\nPeter and his brother took over the operation of the ironworks about 1765, with Peter operating the Hopewell Forges and Curtis the Cornwall Furnace. They were successful operators of the ironworks through the Revolution. They were, however, complex individuals whose affairs were closely intertwined and became increasingly acrimonious. Their ongoing feuds and legal entanglements led to the fragmentation of the ironwork's ownership and its eventual loss by the Grubb family into the hands of Robert Coleman, who used it to build his fortune.\n\nTensions between the brothers reached the crisis point in 1783 when Curtis decided to marry his 20-year-old cousin Ann Grubb, granddaughter of the brothers' uncle Nathaniel Grubb. Inheritance concerns by Curtis' oldest son, Peter III (actually called Peter Jr. to distinguish him from Curtis' brother Peter), resulted in him being given a portion of Curtis' holdings, which then required a legal division of the assets that had previously been shared informally. Included in Peter III's newly acquired assets were a one-third interest in the Hopewell Forges. Peter, who had been running the forges, became fearful and reacted by purchasing land at Mount Hope to build his own furnace in competition with his brother, going heavily into debt. The feud intensified and Peter III became concerned for the business and sold his interest to Robert Coleman, a friend who had worked for the brothers and was by then also an ironmaster. Curtis, concerned with the competition, allied himself with Coleman and tried various tactics to put Peter out of business. Succumbing to the pressure, Peter became distraught and committed suicide in 1786, at the age of only 45. The ironworks were apportioned by the courts among Curtis, Peter's estate, and Coleman.\n\nRobert Coleman additionally acquired the Mount Hope furnace from Peter's estate. After Curtis' death in 1789 he operated the ironworks for the heirs until 1798, when they sold their interests to him. Thus Robert Coleman became the owner of most of the former Grubb holdings, which he added to his own and expanded to become Pennsylvania's first millionaire.\n\nThe holdings remaining in Peter's estate were eventually expanded upon by his second son Henry Bates Grubb, whose family went on to become one of Pennsylvania's largest iron producers in the mid-19th century, with their center of operations at Mount Hope Estate.\n\nBefore the brothers took over the ironworks in 1765, Peter had moved to the mansion built by his father and was learning the iron making business. He continued to reside in the mansion and took over operation of the Hopewell Forges. The Hopewell Forge Mansion still stands, denoted by a historic marker, on modern-day Route 322.\n\nPeter married Mary Shippen Burd, of Lancaster, in 1771, at the Burd family estate known as \"Tinian.\" They had two sons, Alan Burd Grubb and Henry Bates Grubb, but unfortunately Mary died from complications of childbirth. Peter never got over the loss, became despondent, and never married again. He was the less gregarious of the brothers, and being a minority partner in the ironworks probably didn't help his disposition. He developed an increasing drinking problem and was known for sometimes erratic behavior. On two occasions he was brought before Council to answer for statements he made while drinking; he was acquitted both times, as he had just \"behaved in his usual mad way.\" Certainly Peter's drinking problem contributed to his suicide in 1786; he took his own life at the Hopewell Forges and was buried there by his brother-in-law Jasper Yeates.\n\nAlthough Peter never married again, he did have a relationship with Hannah Bellarby Grubb, the adopted daughter of his uncle Samuel Grubb. Hannah came into Peter's household after Mary's death to help with the two infants. Peter and Hannah had a daughter, Hannah Elizabeth Grubb, late that same year. Peter acknowledged his daughter, later remembering her in his will, but did not marry Hannah. Hannah is believed to have then moved with her daughter to Curtis Grubb's household to help care for his two young children, whose mother had also died, probably in childbirth. Hannah later bore Curtis a son, Jehu Grubb. Peter also had a relationship with a Susan Brandelbury before he was married; a son was produced, Samuel Brandelbury, who was also remembered in Peter's will.\n\nWith their remaining share of Peter's estate as a foundation, this family become one of the largest iron producers in Pennsylvania during the mid-19th century.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of six lines on the Metro Rail System, operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\nThe Metro Purple Line is one of the city's two subway lines (along with the Metro Red Line). Although they separate west of Downtown Los Angeles, the two subway lines (Purple and Red) were originally branded as two branches of the Red Line. The Purple Line was instituted as its own line, separate from the Red Line, in 2006. , the combined Red and Purple lines averaged 169,478 boardings per weekday. Out of the eight stations served, only two of them are exclusive to the Purple Line, with the other six shared with the Red Line.\n\nThe Metro Purple Line is a line that begins at Union Station. At Union Station, passengers can connect to the Metro Silver Line bus rapid transit line, and the Metro Gold Line. The Purple Line travels southwest through Downtown Los Angeles, passing the Civic Center, Pershing Square (near the Historic Core) and the Financial District. Passengers can connect to the Metro Silver Line (both directions) at Civic Center Station. At Pershing Square Station, passengers can board the northbound Metro Silver Line bus at Olive Street/5th Street. At Station, travelers can connect to the Metro Blue Line, Metro Expo Line and the Metro Silver Line.

They operate every twelve minutes during the daytime weekdays and all day on the weekends after approximately 10 a.m. (with a 15-minute headway early Saturday and Sunday mornings). Night service can range between 20–30 minutes.\n\nThe Purple Line is utilized mostly as a downtown shuttle on its shared segment with the Red Line. The stub between Vermont and Western has a very low ridership. According to Metro Service Coordinator Conan Cheung, the stub is operating 11% full during peak hours, and even lower at other times.\n\nThe current Purple Line is the product of a long-term plan to connect Downtown Los Angeles to central and western portions of the city with a heavy rail subway system. Originally planned in the 1980s to travel west down Wilshire Boulevard to Fairfax Avenue and then north to the San Fernando Valley, a methane explosion at a Ross Dress for Less clothing store near Fairfax in 1985, just as construction got underway, led to a legal prohibition on tunnelling in a large part of Mid-Wilshire. Instead, after some wrangling, a new route was chosen up Vermont Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard. However, a short one-mile branch down Wilshire from Vermont to Western was allowed to remain in the system.\n\nThe service currently designated as the Purple Line opened in two \"minimum operating segments:\"\n\n\n\nThe Vermont branch began service in 1999. Initally, both branches were designated as part of the Red Line, but in 2006 trains travelling between Union Station and Wilshire/Western were rebranded the Purple Line for greater clarity.\n\nMetro is now aiming to complete the subway to the Westside. The new project is called the Purple Line Extension (the project was previously called the Westside Subway Extension) and the first phase broke ground on November 7, 2014. Metro released the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) on March 19, 2012, and the first phase of the project (to Wilshire / La Cienega) was approved by Metro's Board of Directors on April 26, 2012. Notice to proceed was issued to Tutor Perini on April 26, 2017 for phase two from Wilshire/La Cienega Station to Century City/Constellation Station. Pre-construction has commenced. Metro is still attempting to obtain funding for phase three.\n\nThe following table lists the stations of the Purple Line, from east to west:\n\nThe Purple Line is operated out of the Division 20 Yard (Santa Fe Yard) located at 320 South Santa Fe Avenue Los Angeles. This yard stores the fleet used on the Red and Purple Line. It is also where heavy maintenance is done on the fleet. Subways get to this yard by continuing on after Union Station. Trains make a right turn before coming to surface level at Ducommun Street, and then travel south to 1st Street where they enter the yard.\n\nThe Purple Line uses Breda A650 electric multiple unit cars built by Breda in Italy. Trains usually run in four-car consists during peak hours and two-car consists outside of peak hours. The acceleration for cars #531 and up is similar to that of cars used by the Washington Metro because they both use General Electric traction motors. The cars are maintained in a Metro yard on Santa Fe Drive near 4th Street alongside the Los Angeles River in Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nIn March 2017, Metro ordered new CRRC HR4000 railcars, some of which will operate on the Purple Line once the extension is completed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10710799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10710799", "title": "Sales variance", "text": "Sales variance\n\nSales variance is the difference between actual sales and budget sales. It is used to measure the performance of a sales function, and/or analyze business results to better understand market conditions.\n\nThere are two reasons actual sales can vary from planned sales: either the volume sold varied from plan (sales volume variance), or sales were at a different price from what was planned (sales price variance). Both scenarios could also simultaneously contribute to the variance.\n\nFor example: The plan was to sell 5 widgets at $3 each, for a budgeted sales of: (5*$3)=$15. In reality, 6 widgets were sold at $2 each, for an actual sales of: (6*$2)=$12. The total variance was thus ($12–$15)=$3 (U)nfavourable or minus $3, since total sales was less than planned.\n\nSales Price Variance: The sales price variance reveals the difference in total revenue caused by charging a different selling price from the planned or standard price. The sales price variance is calculated as: Actual quantity sold * (actual selling price - planned selling price). In the example, the sales price variance was 6*($2–$3)= -$6 (U)nfavourable or minus $6, since the sales price was less than planned.\n\nSales Volume Variance is calculated as: budgeted selling price*(actual sales volume-budgeted sales volume)\n\nSales Volume Variance is further sub-divided into two variances.\n\nThe total variance can thus be seen algebraically to be (minus $6) plus (plus $3), giving (minus $3). Or: -6+3=-3.\n\nThis result tells us that the negative effect of selling at a lower price was twice the positive effect of selling at a higher volume than planned. This might have occurred where prices were lowered to increase volume, but actual volume increases did not meet expectations, perhaps due to competitors also cutting their prices, or changes in customer preferences.\n"}

She is Indonesia's Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries under President Joko Widodo's 2014-2019 Working Cabinet. She is also the owner of PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product, a seafood export company, and PT ASI Pudjiastuti Aviation, which operates Susi Air charter airline.\n\nPudjiastuti was born 15 January 1965, in Pangandaran, West Java, the daughter of Haji Ahmad Karlan and Hajjah Suwuh Lasminah. She is Javanese, but her family are fifth-generation settlers of Pangandaran which is predominantly Sundanese. Her family business was engaged primarily in real estate and livestock farming.\n\nFollowing junior high school, Pudjiastuti continued senior high school at SMA Negeri 1 Yogyakarta, but did not complete her studies after she was expelled for political activism in the Golput (Golongan Putih, or absenteeism in protest of Golkar rule) movement, which was banned under then President Suharto's New Order. Pudjiastuti was the first Indonesian minister to have never completed a high school education, although after she became a government minister she enrolled for a late high school program (\"Paket C\") and she officially graduated in 2018.\n\nSusi Pudjiastuti has three children, Panji Hilmansyah, Nadine Kaiser, and Alvy Xavier. Her first son, Panji Hilmansyah, died aged 31 at January 2016 in Florida due to heart failure. Susi is divorced and is known to have tattoos and be a chain-smoker.\n\nIn 1983 Pudjiastuti embarked on a career as an entrepreneur, starting as a seafood distributor at a Fish Auction Facility (TPI) in Pangandaran. Her distributorship evolved into a seafood processing plant in 1996 named PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product which specialized in export-quality lobsters packaged as \"Susi Brand.\" PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product expanded and began exporting its products to Asia and America.\n\nThe growing demand for PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product's fresh seafood lead to rapid air transport as a necessity for the business. In 2004, Pudjiastuti acquired a Cessna 208 Caravan and established PT ASI Pudjiastuti Aviation. The Cessna was given the call-sign \"Susi Air\" and was used to transport fresh Indonesian seafood to Jakarta as well as overseas to Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan.\n\nDuring the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami which devastated Aceh and the west coast of Sumatra, Susi Air, which at the time only consisted of two Cessna Grand Caravans, was one of the first responders which distributed food and supplies to victims in isolated areas of the disaster. During this period, Susi Air was routinely chartered in Aceh by NGOs for humanitarian relief missions. The revenues earned from the NGO Aceh missions enabled Susi Air to acquire new airplanes and expand its fleet to routes in Papua and Kalimantan. Susi Air is now the largest operator of Cessna Grand Caravans in the Asia Pacific region \n\nOn 26 October 2014, President Joko Widodo appointed Pudjiastuti as Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries under his 2014-2019 working cabinet. Prior to accepting her appointment, Pudjiastuti relinquished her position as President Director of PT ASI Pudjiastuti Marine Product and PT ASI Pudjiastuti Aviation.\n\nShe inherited an agency in danger of being eliminated. Foreign fishing boats regularly encroached on Indonesian waters surrounding the archipelago's 17,500 islands. She impounded hundreds of foreign fishing boats and then blew them up. Since taking office, most of the 10,000 foreign fishing boats preying on Indonesia's biodiversity have quit Indonesian waters. From 2013–2017 fishing stocks have more than doubled on her watch.\n\nOn 16 September 2016, WWF awarded her the Leaders for a Living Planet Award. This is in recognition of her efforts as Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries in promoting sustainable development in the Indonesian fisheries sector and conservation of the marine ecosystem, as well as her fierce crackdown on illegal fishing in Indonesian waters.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal \"Nature\", Susi's aggressive anti-illegal fishing policies have \"reduced total fishing effort by at least 25%, (...) [potentially] generate a 14% increase in catch and a 12% increase in profit.\"\n\n"}

It has a casino, several restaurants, a business center, and a pool. The casino now has more than 1,000 slot machines and 22 table games located on two floors. It is the tallest building in downtown Las Vegas and the second-tallest inside the city limits, having been surpassed by Allure Las Vegas in 2007.\n\nAs Fitzgeralds, it had a \"luck of the Irish\" theme, with shamrocks and a leprechaun. In fall 2012, The D completed a property-wide renovation and rebranding to replace the Irish theme with a more contemporary feel.\n\nThe Sundance Hotel opened in 1980 on land owned by Moe Dalitz. Dalitz, an organized crime figure, faced difficulty from the Gaming Commission, so the casino was nominally run by his associates, Al Sachs and Herb Tobman, who also owned the Stardust and Fremont casinos.\n\nIn 1983, Sachs and Tobman faced suspension of their gaming licenses due to charges of skimming. Dalitz applied to manage the Sundance himself, but the Gaming Commission stalled on his application, until July 1984, when he agreed to surrender management to Jackie Gaughan until the casino could be sold.\n\nFinally, in 1987, the Sundance was sold to Lincoln Management Group (later Fitzgeralds Gaming) and renamed as Fitzgeralds Las Vegas.\n\nIn December 2001, with Fitzgeralds Gaming in bankruptcy, The Majestic Star Casino, LLC, owned by Don Barden, bought the property, along with two other Fitzgeralds casinos in Colorado and Mississippi, for a total of $149 million. At that point, Barden became the first African American casino owner in Las Vegas. Barden separated Fitzgeralds Las Vegas from the Majestic Star umbrella two years later, to free it from restrictions imposed by the company's lenders.\n\nIn May 2008, it was reported that Barden was pledging the property to generate a $35-million equity stake in a slots-only casino in Pittsburgh, making a sale likely for Fitzgeralds Las Vegas. It was subsequently reported, however, that Barden had no need to sell Fitzgeralds to maintain a stake in the slots-only casino in Pittsburgh and that it would remain an asset which he could use to generate cash for his struggling gambling portfolio.\n\nIn October 2011, several months after Barden's death, his estate sold Fitzgeralds to brothers Derek and Greg Stevens, majority owners of the Golden Gate casino. Derek took a 78% ownership share, with 22% for Greg.\n\nThe new owners completed a $22 million renovation and rebranding to become the D Las Vegas in Fall 2012. the D Las Vegas Casino Hotel stands for \"downtown\", and also refers to Derek Stevens' nickname, and the Stevens' hometown of Detroit. The remodel gave the property a more modern feel, including the addition of dancing dealers in table games. The second-floor casino has a \"Vintage Vegas\" theme featuring one of the only operational Sigma Derby games in Las Vegas.\n\nThe multimillion-dollar renovation upgraded all of the guest rooms and created luxury suites. The D also added a fine Italian steakhouse, Joe Vicari's Andiamo Italian Steakhouse, and opened the first American Coney Island outside of Michigan on the building's Fremont Street frontage. The property also features three distinct bars: Longbar, said to be the longest bar in Nevada at just fewer than 100 feet long; D Bar – a permanent outdoor bar on Fremont Street Experience featuring flair bartenders as well as dancing bartenders; and Vue Bar inside the second floor casino. The property's Fremont Street façade was enhanced with the addition of an exterior escalator and interactive video exhibition created by former Cirque du Soleil producer Roger Parent, which together feature more than 40 giant flat-screen monitors combined with hundreds of feet of LED signage. Parent is also responsible for the casino's interior escalator which uses LED technology and music depicting vintage imagery to transport guests to the vintage second-floor casino.\n\nIn February 2017, The D added an exterior video wall promoted as the \"World's Largest Keno Board\", displaying a live feed of keno numbers as they're drawn inside the casino.\n\nIn 2013, the D expanded into hosting martial arts events as the venue hosted Lion Fight 11, a Muay Thai Tournament. The main event featured a match between Tetsuya Yamato, former WBC Muay Thai Japan Champion, and Kevin Ross, an American Muay Thai boxer. In addition, Lion Fight 11 was featured on AXS TV, a company founded by Mark Cuban.\n\nIn late 2013, the D became the first casino in the world to accept bitcoin for hotel rooms, restaurants, and gift shop items. Additionally, a bitcoin ATM was installed next to the gaming floor where customers can buy and sell bitcoin instantly for cash. \n"}

This is a critical point in the lifespan of a company as it denotes when the directors' responsibilities change from the shareholders to the creditors. It also means that the directors need to be extremely careful when considering whether to continue to trade, or not. Any director who knows that the company is insolvent and makes the decision to continue to trade, and in doing so increases the debts of the company can be made liable for the company debts.\n\nIn most legal systems, the liability in respect of other transactions only extends for a certain period of time prior to the company going into liquidation. In the UK, directors are exposed in respect of transaction at an undervalue, preferences, and extortionate credit transactions if the transaction occurred: a) while the company was insolvent; and b) within 2 years before the onset of liquidation if the transaction was with a connected person, and 6 months if the transaction was with an unconnected person.\n\nDirectors who continue to trade while insolvent may face disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Under the provision of this act, when a company goes into liquidation, the liquidator must make a report to the Disqualification Unit of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on the conduct of all directors. If the liquidator has come across any conduct which makes the director unfit to be involved in the management of a company in the future (which things would include trading while insolvent) the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will apply to the Court for an order disqualifying the director or directors from acting as a company director for a certain period of time.\n\nMany other countries have similar laws, often referred to as 'insolvent trading' or wrongful trading.\n\n"}
