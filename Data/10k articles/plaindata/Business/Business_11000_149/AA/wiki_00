It has been declared a landmark as one of Manhattan's most influential early skyscrapers.\n\nThe building was constructed from 1894 to 1896, following designs by noted architect Bruce Price. It was one of Manhattan's first buildings with steel framing and curtain wall construction. At its original 21 stories, it was Price's first tall building and the second tallest building in New York.\n\nIn an interview, Price described his design as \"a campanile with four pilaster faces, the seven flutes being represented by seven rows of windows\". The building is set on an irregular, trapezoidal lot, and designed as a Neo-Renaissance tower clad in Maine granite with a 3-story base, a 12-story shaft, and a 6-story cap. (Its 4th and 15 stories are transitional.) The base is an Ionic entrance colonnade topped with sculptures in a classical style by J. Massey Rhind. Above rises a middle section of horizontally banded piers with vertical strips framing the windows, which culminates in a row of figural sculptures extending from the 14th to 15th stories. A further six-story cap (subsequently modified) featured a colonnade of Corinthian pilasters, stone cornice, and a crowning parapet of gilded metal acroteria on the setback 20th and 21st stories.\n\nThe North American Trust Company was organized in early 1896, and at the start of 1898, the company was located in the American Surety Building at 100 Broadway.\n\nIn 1920-1922, New York architect Herman Lee Meader supervised alterations, which included a new L-shaped annex that widened the tower from 7 to 11 bays, and addition of several stories, which greatly modified the original cap.\n"}

Page Center for Integrity in Public Communication\n\nThe Arthur W. Page Center for Integrity in Public Communication is a research center at the Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications at the Pennsylvania State University. The center is dedicated to the study and advancement of ethics and responsibility in corporate communication and other forms of public communication.\n\nThe center is named for Arthur W. Page, widely regarded as the founder of modern corporate public relations, whose views have been distilled into the Page Principles: (1) tell the truth; (2) prove it with action; (3) listen to stakeholders; (4) manage for tomorrow; (5) conduct public relations as if the whole enterprise depends on it; (6) realize that an enterprise's true character is expressed by its people; and (7) remain calm, patient and good-humored. \n\nBringing the center to Penn State was the idea of alumnus Lawrence G. Foster, who retired as corporate vice-president of public relations at Johnson & Johnson. The launch was made possible by a $300,000 gift he and his wife Ellen made to the college. Foster worked on the project with Edward M. Block, retired vice-president of public relations at AT&T, and John A. Koten, retired senior vice president of corporate communications at Ameritech. All three played leading roles in the formation of The Arthur W. Page Society, which functions as a separate entity.\n\nThe Page Center annually honors individuals who, over the course of their careers, have demonstrated consistent and fervent commitment to the concept of “truth well told.\" Three icons of the profession are recognized each February at an awards dinner held in New York City. Hundreds of professionals attend as the honorees are given a Larry Foster Award for Integrity in Public Communication, named after the center's founder. Past honorees include Ann Barkelew, Dick Martin, Alan Murray, Bill George, Gwen Ifill and John Onoda.\n\nThe Page Center seeks to foster a modern understanding and application of the Page principles and Robert Wood Johnson’s business philosophy by supporting innovative research, educational or public service projects in a variety of academic disciplines and professional fields.\n\nThe center supports three ongoing programs, as set out below.\n\nAs of April 2018, the center has awarded more than $900,000 to scholars and professionals throughout the world to support research that makes important contributions to knowledge, practice or public understanding of ethics and responsibility in public communication or other principles of Arthur W. Page. Topics of research have included digital media, corporate social responsibility, sustainability, advocacy and fake news. \n\nPrintable transcripts, streaming video, and searchable indexed content provide history, analysis and individual comment on public relations and the media from the luminaries in the field. To date, the Center has conducted 31 interviews and has transcribed and indexed many acquired videos from the Arthur W. Page Society and other contributors.\n\nThe Page Center also is the archive for Page’s previously uncollected papers and memorabilia and related research materials in the area of ethics in public communication and corporate responsibility.\n"}

It is a vast area of finance and accounting research. The importance of the area is due in part to the relevance for creditors and investors in evaluating the likelihood that a firm may go bankrupt.\n\nThe quantity of research is also a function of the availability of data: for public firms which went bankrupt or did not, numerous accounting ratios that might indicate danger can be calculated, and numerous other potential explanatory variables are also available. Consequently, the area is well-suited for testing of increasingly sophisticated, data-intensive forecasting approaches.\n\nThe history of bankruptcy prediction includes application of numerous statistical tools which gradually became available, and involves deepening appreciation of various pitfalls in early analyses. Research is still published that suffers pitfalls that have been understood for many years.\n\nBankruptcy prediction has been a subject of formal analysis since at least 1932, when FitzPatrick published a study of 20 pairs of firms, one failed and one surviving, matched by date, size and industry, in \"The Certified Public Accountant\". He did not perform statistical analysis as is now common, but he thoughtfully interpreted the ratios and trends in the ratios. His interpretation was effectively a complex, multiple variable analysis.\n\nIn 1967, William Beaver applied t-tests to evaluate the importance of individual accounting ratios within a similar pair-matched sample.\n\nIn 1968, in the first formal multiple variable analysis, Edward I. Altman applied multiple discriminant analysis within a pair-matched sample. One of the most prominent early models of bankruptcy prediction is the Altman Z-score, which is still applied today.\n\nIn 1980, James Ohlson applied logit regression in a much larger sample that did not involve pair-matching.\n\nSurvival methods are now applied.\n\nOption valuation approaches involving stock price variability have been developed. Under structural models, a default event is deemed to occur for a firm when its assets reach a sufficiently low level compared to its liabilities.\n\nNeural network models and other sophisticated models have been tested on bankruptcy prediction.\n\nModern methods applied by business information companies surpass the annual accounts content and also consider current events like age, judgements, bad press, payment incidents and payment experiences from creditors.\n\nThe latest research within the field of Bankruptcy and Insolvency Prediction compares various differing approaches, modelling techniques, and individual models to ascertain whether any one technique is superior to its counterparts.\n\nJackson and Wood (2013) provides an excellent discussion of the literature to date, including an empirical evaluation of 15 popular models from the existing literature. These models range from the univariate models of Beaver through the multidimensional models of Altman and Ohlson, and continuing to more recent techniques which include option valuation approaches. They find that models based on market data - such as an option valuation approach - outperform those earlier models which rely heavily on accounting numbers.\n\nZhang, Wang, and Ji (2013) proposed a novel rule-based system to solve bankruptcy prediction problem. The whole procedure consists of the following four stages: first, sequential forward selection was used to extract the most important features; second, a rule-based model was chosen to fit the given dataset since it can present physical meaning; third, a genetic ant colony algorithm (GACA) was introduced; the fitness scaling strategy and the chaotic operator were incorporated with GACA, forming a new algorithm—fitness-scaling chaotic GACA (FSCGACA), which was used to seek the optimal parameters of the rule-based model; and finally, the stratified K-fold cross-validation technique was used to enhance the generalization of the model.\n\n"}

{"id": "1967367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967367", "title": "Consignee", "text": "Consignee\n\nIn a contract of carriage, the consignee is the entity who is financially responsible (the buyer) for the receipt of a shipment. Generally, but not always, the consignee is the same as the receiver.\n\nIf a sender dispatches an item to a receiver via a delivery service, the sender is the \"sender\", the recipient is the \"consignee\", and the deliverer is the \"carrier\".\n\nThis is a difficult area of law in that it regulates the mass transportation industry which cannot always guarantee arrival on time or that goods will not be damaged in the course of transit. Furthermore, two other problems are that unpaid consignors or freight carriers may wish to hold goods until payment is made, and fraudulent individuals may seek to take delivery in place of the legitimate consignees. The key to resolving such disputes lies in the documentation. The standard form of contract is a bill of lading which, in international shipping law, is simply a contract for the carriage of goods entered into between the shipper and the carrier that is not a charter party. It is always a term of that contract that the carrier must deliver the goods to a specific receiver. \n\nA straight bill of lading by land or sea, or air waybill are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an \"order\" or \"bearer\" bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the Hague Rules, and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in Hong Kong, there is no need to present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting \"obiter dicta\" in \"The Rafaela S\" [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and \"The Happy Ranger\" [2002] 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of cargo being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge port.\n\nThe rights of the consignee under an air waybill are regulated by the Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, 1929 and the Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air 1999 and the relevant state laws (which may be one law chosen as the proper law by the parties, or any combination of laws representing the seller, buyer, consignor, and carrier.)\nThis is very important as per export documents.\n\nThe receiver can be different than that of the consignee.\n\nIt is helpful to give and take the information about to be paid and received.\nIt helps to settle dispute as it includes the detail about the goods and terms of trade and payment.\nIt informs the selling price to the consignee. \nIt helps to know the quality , the quantity, the price and the discount to the importer."}

Downtown is generally considered to be the area bounded by Dougherty Street on the north, Broad Street and the University of Georgia campus on the south, Pulaski Street on the west, and Foundry Street by the east.\n\nA Downtown Athens Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by Austin Kinsey in 1978.\n\nThe commercial and governmental heart of the city has traditionally been toward the eastern end of Downtown Athens, between Lumpkin and Thomas Streets. Recent developments, particularly between Lumpkin and Pulaski Streets, have expanded the boundaries of the \"central\" part of the neighborhood. The term \"Downtown Athens\" can also mean this smaller, more commercial area, particularly when used in the context of the city's nightlife and restaurants. \n\nSome definitions of \"Downtown\" include the area west of Pulaski Street, which is a much more residential area characterized by historic homes, new infill construction, and some public housing. This part of Downtown Athens has the highest concentration of hotels particularly along Broad Street. The Prince Avenue commercial corridor is an important center of business, particularly for those living in the Boulevard and Normaltown neighborhoods.\n\nThe area has several hotels and apartment buildings, and more high-rise condos are either under construction or planned for the area. Some of these high-rises as well as the construction of the new Multi-Modal Transportation Center have the potential to redefine the area encompassing downtown Athens to stretch east to the banks of the Oconee River.\n\nThe exact delineation of what is \"Downtown\" differs for varying purposes. Some of the more common ones are:\n\nThe Downtown area is the cultural center of the city. Several dozen night clubs host performances of local, regional and national bands and artists. The 40 Watt Club at the corner of Washington and Pulaski and Georgia Theater on Lumpkin Street between Clayton and Washington are among the most well-known night spots where many bands have made the jump to a larger regional stage (See Music of Athens, Georgia). The Classic Center, located on Thomas Street on the eastern edge of the neighborhood, is a multi-purpose facility containing a performing arts center, convention space, and banquet halls. It was a filming site for \"Blue Collar TV\".\n\nDowntown Athens is home to award-winning restaurants including The Last Resort and Weaver D's. Five & Ten, a high class expensive restaurant is known for the famous chef, Hugh Acheson, who was named Best Chef Southeast by the James Beard Foundation and also on . Other notable restaurants include The Porterhouse Grill and De Palmas. There are a variety of eating options, ranging from higher-priced luxury dining, chain restaurants, ethnic food restaurants, and inexpensive bar food. The streets, particularly on Thursday through Saturday, are filled with people and cars late into the night. Popular bars are on every street corner, including Magnolia's, Allgood, Blue Sky, Silver Dollar, General Beauregard's, Walker's Pub, Boars Head, Sandbar and Trappeze. There are around 80 bars in Athens. In recent years, nightlife for this demographic has been concentrated in the neighborhood's rapidly changing \"West End\", the area between Lumpkin and Pulaski Streets. Nightlife catering to a more mainstream college-age demographic remains in the eastern part of the neighborhood, especially along Broad and Clayton Streets. During the day, visitors of all ages can find a reason to visit Downtown Athens.\n\nLocally- owned fashion boutiques line the streets, including Encore, Heery's and Cheeky Peach that all include designer brand names. Catering to the city's diverse populations, vintage shops like Agora and Cillies host a variety of items. Many of these outlets reflect Athens's status as a university town and a small liberal city. In particular, independent music stores such as the world-famous Wuxtry Records and alternative shops are found along Clayton Street, as well as the Georgia Bulldogs fan shop known as The Red Zone.\n\nThe Athens-Clarke County unified government is located in the Downtown district. Several local and federal government buildings are located along Washington Street, and the county adult health center is located just within the western boundary of Downtown.\n"}

{"id": "2097211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2097211", "title": "Liquidated damages", "text": "Liquidated damages\n\nLiquidated damages (also referred to as liquidated and ascertained damages) are damages whose amount the parties designate during the formation of a contract for the injured party to collect as compensation upon a specific breach (e.g., late performance).\n\nWhen damages are not predetermined/assessed in advance, then the amount recoverable is said to be 'at large' (to be agreed or determined by a court or tribunal in the event of breach).\n\nGenerally, at common law, a liquidated damages clause will not be enforced if its purpose is to punish the wrongdoer/party in breach rather than to compensate the injured party (in which case it is referred to as a penal or penalty clause). One reason for this is that the enforcement of the term would, in effect, require an equitable order of specific performance. However, courts sitting in equity will seek to achieve a fair result and will not enforce a term that will lead to the unjust enrichment of the enforcing party.\n\nIn order for a liquidated damages clause to be upheld, two conditions must be met. \nDamages that are sufficiently uncertain may be referred to as unliquidated damages, and may be so categorized because they are not mathematically calculable or are subject to a contingency which makes the amount of damages uncertain.\n\nFor example, suppose Neal Townsend agrees to lease a store-front to Richard Smith, from which Richard intends to sell jewellery. If Townsend breaches the contract by refusing to lease the store-front at the appointed time, it will be difficult to determine what profits Smith will have lost because the success of newly created small businesses is highly uncertain. This, therefore, would be an appropriate circumstance for Smith to insist upon a liquidated damages clause in case Townsend fails to perform.\n\nIn the case of construction contracts, courts have occasionally refused to enforce liquidated damages provisions, choosing to follow the doctrine of concurrent delay when both parties have contributed to the overall delay of the project.\n\nContracts in the NEC3 family use the term 'low service damages' (optional clause X.17) and generally include a Low Service Damages Schedule.\n\nIn Australia, the definition of liquidated damages applies to the situations where upon the failure of a primary stipulation, imposes a detriment to the first party or a benefit to the second party by a secondary stipulation collateral to the primary stipulation (i.e. it does not have to be a breach).\n\nUK bank and credit card customers were being charged as much as £39 for a single transaction that took them over their credit limit. Consumers argued these charges were well beyond the cost of sending a computerised letter.\n\nIn 2007 the Office of Fair Trading investigated the charges being imposed on customers of credit card companies. In its report, the OFT claimed these charges were unlawful under UK law as they amounted to a penalty. It said it would be prepared to investigate any charge over £12, though this was not intended to indicate that £12 is a fair and acceptable charge. The OFT said it would be up to a court to determine such an amount based on the established legal precedent that the only recoverable cost would be actual costs incurred.\n\nThe credit card companies did not produce evidence of their actual costs to the OFT, instead insisting their charges are in line with clear policy and information provided to customers.\n\nReceipt of liquidated damages and intimately linked with the purpose of the profit-making apparatus, is a capital receipt. The amount received by the assessee towards compensation for seterilization of the profit earning source is not in the ordinary course of business. Hence, it is a capital receipt in the hands of the assessee.\n\nIn 2009 the Supreme Court ruled (\"see Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc\") that terms in bank account contracts were not capable of being penal, bar those applicable to NatWest Bank customers between 2001 and 2003. The court ruled that the charges were a charge for a service, and not a penalty for damages for breaching a contract term.\n\nIn 2012, the High Court of Australia allowed an appeal against findings of the Federal Court of Australia that 'exception fees' imposed by the ANZ Bank could not constitute an unenforceable penalty. The High Court found that fees were not incapable of being characterised as penalties merely because they were not charged upon breach of contract.\n\nConversely, in 2014, the federal court (Gordon J) described $35 late payment fees by ANZ Banking Group to customers who failed to make their monthly minimum credit card repayment as being “extravagant, exorbitant and unconscionable” and ordered for these fees to be reimbursed. ANZ appealed.\n\nIn 2015, the full court overturned Justice Gordon’s first instance judgment that credit card late payment fees charged by ANZ to its customers constituted penalties at law and equity (and were therefore largely unenforceable). The decision otherwise upholds Justice Gordon's findings that honour, dishonour and overlimit fees charged by ANZ were not penalties, unconscionable or unfair. While the decision is very fact specific, it represented a major setback for other class actions based on penalties. Paciocco appealed to the High Court.\n\nThe last chapter of the bank fees saga took place in July 2016 where the High Court dismissed the appeal for leave and held that the full court was correct to characterise the loss provision costs, regulatory capital costs and collection costs as affecting the legitimate interests of the Bank. The Court asserted that the fact that those categories of costs could not be recovered in an action for damages did not alter that conclusion. Further, neither the fact that the late payment fees were not genuine pre-estimates of damage nor the fact that the amounts charged were disproportionate to the actual loss suffered by itself rendered the late payment fees penalties. High Court\n\nIn the United States, Section 2-718(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code provides that, in contracts for the sale of goods:\n\nThis largely mirrors the common law rule, which applies to other types of contracts under the law of most US states.\n\nCivil law systems generally impose less severe restrictions on liquidated damages. For example, Article 1226 of the French Civil Code provides for \"clause pénale\", a variant of liquidated damages which combines compensatory and coercive elements. Judges may adjust excessive contract penalties, but such clauses are not generally void as a matter of French law.\n\nArticle 420-1 of the Civil Code of Japan provides an even firmer basis to uphold contractual penalties:\n\n\nIn the U.S. state of Louisiana, which follows a civil law system, liquidated damages are referred to as \"stipulated damages\". Prior to 1 January 1985, Louisiana law used the term “penal clause” under former article 2117 of the Civil Code. Stipulated damages create a secondary obligation for the purpose of enforcing the principal obligation. The aggrieved party may demand either the stipulated damages or performance of the principal obligation, but may not demand both except for delay. Stipulated damages may not be modified by the court (and will therefore be enforced) \"unless they are so manifestly unreasonable as to be contrary to public policy\".\n\nIslamic law prohibits \"gharar\" (uncertainty) in contracts, and liquidated damages provisions are a favored mechanism to overcome uncertainty regarding contractual damages.\n\nsee also \n\n"}

Marketing intelligence is necessary when entering a foreign market.\n\nMarketing intelligence determines the intelligence needed, collects it by searching environment and delivers it to marketing managers who need it. Marketing intelligence software can be deployed using an on-premises or software as a service (SaaS, or cloud-based) model. These systems take data from disparate data sources, like web analytics, business intelligence, call center and sales data, which often come separate reports, and put them into a single environment. In order to collect marketing intelligence, marketing managers must be in constant touch with relevant books, newspapers and trade publications. They must talk to various stakeholders like customers, distributors, and suppliers. In addition to this, they must also monitor social media and carry out online discussions. Marketing managers can design reports that correlate and visualize data coming from a variety of departments and sources (even, in some cases, external data.) This allows them to see current key performance indicators in real time (or as quickly as sources provide data) and analyze trends, rather than wait for analysts to deliver periodic reports.\n\nMarketing intelligence systems are designed to be used by marketing managers and often viewed by employees throughout an organization. Notable systems on the market include Leadtime, Pardot, Marketo, and Hubspot. They may have user interfaces that closely resemble consumer software than the software around individual data sources, which are designed for use by analysts. Business intelligence, for example, can collect highly accurate, timely, granular data, but often requires IT support to build and edit custom reports.\n\nOrganizationally, marketing intelligence can be the name of the department that performs both the market intelligence and competitor analysis roles. Business intelligence of any kind may also be their responsibility, in tandem with (or solely performed by) the Finance department, for measuring market share and setting growth targets, the mergers and acquisitions group for exploring acquisition opportunities, the legal department to protect the organization's assets or research and development for cross-company comparison of innovation trends and the discovery of opportunities through innovative differentiation.\n\nSteps to be taken by a Company to improve its Marketing Intelligence\n\n(1) Train and Motivate Sales Force: A company's sales force can be an excellent source of information about the current trends in the market. They are the \"intelligence gatherers\" for the company. The acquired facts can be regarding the company's market offerings, whether any improvements are required or not or is there any opportunity for new products, etc. It can also provide a credible source to know about competitor activities, consumers, distributors, and retailers.\n\n(2) Motivate Distributors, retailers, and other intermediaries to pass along important intelligence: Specialists are hired by companies to gather marketing intelligence. In order to measure the quality of production, the way the employees are behaving with customers, quality of facilities being provided; retailers and service providers send mystery shoppers. Firms can also assess the quality of customer experience with the shops with the use of mystery shoppers.\n\n(3) Network Externally: Every firm must keep a tab on its competitors. Competitive intelligence describes the broader discipline of researching, analyzing and formulating data and information from the entire competitive environment of any organization. This can be done by purchasing the competitor's products, checking the advertising campaigns, the press media coverage, reading their published reports, etc. Competitive intelligence must be legal and ethical.\n\n(4) Set up a customer advisory panel: Companies can set up panels consisting of customers. They can be the company's largest customers or representatives of customers or the most outspoken customers. Many business schools set up panels consisting of alumni who provide their knowledge and expertise and help in constituting the course curriculum.\n\n(5) Optimal usage of Government data resources: Governments of almost all countries publish reports regarding the population trends, demographic characteristics, agricultural production and a lot of other such data. All this data must be or can be referred to as base data. It can help in planning and formulating policies for the companies.\n\n(6) Information bought from external suppliers: Certain agencies sell data that can be useful to other companies. For example, television channels will require information on the number of viewership, ratings of TV programs, etc. An agency which calculates this information and generates this data will provide it to companies that need it.\n\n(7) Collect Competitive Intelligence through online customer feedback: Customer's view about a product is essential for any company. Ultimately it's the customer who's buying the product. Hence customer feedback must be taken. Online platforms like chat rooms, blogs, discussion forums, customer review boards can be used to generate customer feedback. This enables the firm to understand customer experiences and impressions. It becomes easier for companies to apply a structured system to do so as it can then scan out the relevant messages without much of a trouble.\n\nWith the above steps being applied, a company's marketing intelligence system will prove to be beneficial to its effective functioning.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51369658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51369658", "title": "Markus Jooste", "text": "Markus Jooste\n\nMarkus Johannes Jooste (born 22 January 1961) is a South African businessman and the former CEO of Steinhoff International. He is an avid horse breeder, and in 2016 was reported to be one of Africa's richest people, worth $400 million. Joining forces with Christo Wiese in 2014, they embarked on an aggressive international expansion programme. Jooste's sudden resignation from Steinhoff on 5 December 2017 was followed by an involved and protracted controversy concerning Steinhoff's accounting practices in its Central European business dating back to 2016, or even 2014. The resulting uncertainty saw some €10 billion (R160 billion) of Steinhoff's value wiped off the markets in a matter of days, with further losses as the situation unfolded.\n\nJooste's father was a postal worker and an avid horse race punter, instilling also in his son an interest in the races. Jooste matriculated from Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool in 1978. Before the 2017 fallout in his business empire, he donated R10 million to the school's old-boys trust in his personal capacity. The donation has since been ring-fenced pending possible claims.\n\nHe obtained a BAcc degree from Stellenbosch University in 1982, and subsequently obtained an honours degree at the University of Cape Town while completing his CA(SA) articles at a company then owned by Christo Wiese.\n\nAfter training as a chartered accountant in his 20s, he was appointed financial director of a publicly listed company. At age 27 he became the financial director of GommaGomma, where he met German entrepreneur Claas Daun, who coached him in business. On his part, Jooste convinced Daun in 1998 to merge his business with that of Bruno Steinhoff in Europe, and to list Steinhoff International on the JSE. Jooste and Daun acted as non-executive directors of Steinhoff International from 1988, and Jooste became its CEO in 2000. In his role as CEO, he built the company through numerous acquisitions from a small furniture manufacturer to a large corporation in the furniture industry. Piet Ferreira, a former investment banker who joined Steinhoff in 2002, was instrumental in structuring its public offerings and complex acquisitions during his 15 year tenure.\n\nNotably, they acquired Conforama in 2011 for €1,207-million, a deal that boosted revenues and growth. 2014 through 2017 saw acquisitions in South Africa, the United Kingdom and United States, which included Mattress Firm for $2.4bn, and Poundland for £597m in depressed retail conditions. Despite being partially funded with Steinhoff shares, the very large premium paid for Mattress Firm prompted scrutiny by independent analysts. The financial press initially ascribed the growth in Jooste's empire to either good luck or fortuitous timing, but the dissenting voices grew silent as Steinhoff raked in 36% growth in its 2014/2015 reporting year. \n\nIn March 2015 Steinhoff bought Pepkor from Wiese and his Brait holding company at R63 billion (then €4.8 billion), implying a very high p-e ratio of 37. After a failed merger with Shoprite in December 2016, Jooste and Wiese raised new capital in 2017 to split off Pepkor's South African division, a move received with some skepticism, as it was seen as a way to pay off Steinhoff’s South African debt. The Pepkor acquisition also occurred without a cautionary announcement, raising suspicions at the FSB about possible insider trading leading up to the deal. The split implied a 71% holding in new entity, Star, which managed more than 5,000 South African stores, more than any other retailer.\n\nOn 4 December 2015 Steinhoff announced that Oldenburg authorities had carried out a 26 November raid on its European headquarters in Westerstede, Germany, in order to review its balance sheet treatment of transfers to subsidiaries or third parties. Three days later, on 7 December, Steinhoff International Holdings transferred its primary listing from Johannesburg to Frankfurt, as, in Jooste's words, the majority of the firm’s stores, customers and revenues were in Europe. Though describing it as \"an important day in the history of Steinhoff\", Jooste chose not to leave Cape Town to attend the event, citing \"neck pain\" which precluded travelling.\n\nSteinhoff's share price peaked at R90 a share in 2016, making it the 15th largest company listed on the Johannesburg exchange. The conglomerate employed over 130,000 people on five continents, and had become the second-largest home goods retailer in Europe after Ikea. In 2017, while its stock was held by some 340 investment funds in South Africa, in part due to its low volatility, its financial position began to worsen as its operating profit margin fell and net debt increased. Its March 2017 accounts showed €3.1 billion in cash reserves, and €18 billion ($21 billion) of exposure to creditors.\n\nSteinhoff limited its effective tax rate to between 8% and 12% for years, notwithstanding the company tax rate of 28% in South Africa, a fact pointed out as a red flag in the wake of the Steinhoff fallout.\n\n\"Manager Magazin\" revealed in August 2017 that Jooste was one of the managers being investigated in Germany. Prosecutors suspected that inflated revenues in the hundred million Euro range may have been reported on the balance sheets of subsidiaries. On 4 December 2017 Steinhoff Holdings disclosed that it would release unaudited annual statements, and the next day Jooste resigned his position as CEO amid allegations of fraud and corruption. Soon after he also resigned from Phumelela Gaming & Leisure, Kenilworth Racing, and Mayfair Speculators.\n\n\"Manager Magazin\" reported in August 2017 that Jooste was being investigated by German authorities. In response Steinhoff's price slumped by 16% on the JSE, but recovered after the company denied the allegations. This was followed by allegations of accounting impropriety made by Steinhoff's former POCO subsidiary. Steve Booysen also alerted the board to possible accounting irregularities after engagements with Deloitte.\n\nJooste's December 2017 resignation as CEO of Steinhoff came as the company admitted to \"accounting irregularities\" within the group, and announced that it had approached PwC to conduct an investigation into these. In a letter to staff on his resignation, Jooste apologized for \"big mistakes\" and that he had caused bad publicity for the company. Viceroy Research immediately tweeted a link to its 37-page report which detailed how Steinhoff had allegedly used off-balance-sheet entities to obfuscate losses and inflate earnings.\n\nBetween 5 and 7 December Steinhoff's share price plunged from R46.25 to R10, and its bonds fell in line as Moody's downgraded Steinhoff bonds from investment grade (Baa3) to junk (B1). Christo Wiese's Upington Investment Holdings held over 30% of Steinhoff's stock and was the biggest loser in the collapse. South Africa's PIC (holding 7%), Coronation and BlackRock all made multi-billion rand losses. The European Central Bank sold its Steinhoff bonds after these had depreciated by 50%, while JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs all reported substantial loan losses. Lenders were owed over €9 billion ($10.6 billion), but in June 2018 the majority were persuaded to a debt standstill and insolvency was avoided.\n\nIt was soon labeled as the biggest corporate scandal in South African history and the biggest corporate crash in the country's history. As a result of Jooste's resignation, $11.4 billion was wiped off the value of the global furniture and clothing retailer. This in turn had a ripple effect on several other companies, including its subsidiary Steinhoff Africa Retail (Star), which may have guaranteed some of Steinhoff's debt. In seven days of trading, the Johannesburg exchange was hit by losses totaling about R295 billion ($24 billion), equivalent to 8% of South Africa's GDP.\n\nSteinhoff's share price dipped to R4.50 (down from R51.40 on 1 December) when the company's accumulated debt of R161 billion ($12.8 billion) was revealed. By late December, Steinhoff shares were on the brink of collapse, as management could not ascertain the magnitude of accounting irregularities, or provide assurances concerning individual companies' cash flows. Steinhoff however won approval to roll over €690m of its financing, and its US subsidiary Mattress Firm secured a loan of $225m from Barclays. Steinhoff also sold PSG shares worth R4.7 billion to increase liquidity. \n\nIn the wake of the scandal media articles identified Jooste's supposed mistress who occupied a luxury apartment in Bantry Bay. Reports also revealed that his hard-nosed executive style earned him a nickname, \"the seagull\", as he would \"fly in and shit all over his subordinates before flying out.\"\n\nPwC was tasked with an investigation into possible accounting irregularities or non-compliance with laws and regulations, and resumption of audited statements were subject to its outcome. German prosecutors confirmed in December 2017 that they were still investigating four current and former managers of a group (identified in the German press as Steinhoff), for accounting fraud. Steinhoff announced in February 2018 that they had submitted a report on Jooste to the Hawks on suspicion of fraud, for investigation and potential prosecution. \n\nChristo Wiese’s Titan Group instituted a claim of R59 billion ($4.8 billion) against the Steinhoff conglomerate to recover cash investments made in 2015 and 2016. The prospects of this claim are however complicated by the fact that Wiese had been Steinhoff director since 2013. Wiese had a 22% shareholding in Steinhoff, the European component of which appears to have been subject to margin loans with different banks.\n\nIn December 2017 Absa Bank and Investec Plc applied for the liquidation of Mayfair Speculators, when Mayfair's Steinhoff shares failed to provide sufficient collateral for its overdraft facilities. Absa, who was owed R350 million, expressed suspicion about R1.5 billion of assets that were transferred as a dividend in specie to Mayfair's holding company in August 2017. According to court documents, Mayfair owed Sanlam capital markets, Investec Plc and Absa more than R1.2 billion ($94 million) in total. Mayfair disclosed liabilities of R1 billion and assets worth R350 million. The Western Cape High Court postponed the banks' application, and the lenders subsequently agreed to grant Mayfair extension until the end of 2018 to facilitate a favourable disposal of its real estate and racehorses.\n\nIn June 2018, a Dutch shareholders association, , filed for damages against Deloitte in Rotterdam, for their failure in vetting the accounts of retailer Steinhoff Int. NV. The association planned to hold the directors, company, accountants, and potentially the banks that promoted Steinhoff's listing, jointly responsible.\n\nThe German raid of 2015 recovered documents supposedly signed by Andreas Seifert, co-managing director of furniture chain XXXLutz. Seifert denied ever having seen or signed the papers, and filed criminal charges for document forgery. After filing additional lawsuits against Steinhoff in three countries, Seifert managed in April 2018 formalize his controlling stake in POCO, which Steinhoff disputed.\n\nJooste entered the horse racing industry in the 1990s with 250 horses, and became the second biggest horse-racing investor in Africa, or perhaps the world. Jooste and his son in law, Stefan Potgieter, manage their horse racing interests through Mayfair Speculators, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mayfair Holdings that was founded in 1987. In 2004 Jooste became a partner in Klawervlei Stud, together with Johan du Plessis, Danie van der Merwe and John Koster, and they chose the four-leaf clover as their emblem. In the next decade other prominent investors joined the enterprise. \n\nJooste's first horse, the stallion National Emblem, was bought for R100,000 in 1993 and became a champion. Mayfair Speculators owned South Africa’s best racehorse, Legal Eagle, a six-time Grade 1 winner, and Edict Of Nantes, a dual Grade 1 winner. They were sold in December 2017 for R3.2 million and R9.9 million respectively. In 2016, The Conglomerate won the Durban July as an outsider.\n\nJooste, in various partnerships, was a regular buyer at racing sales. In 2014 he impressed with his buying power at Arqana's premium sale in Deauville. In 2015 he added 12 yearlings to his stables at Tattersalls Book One, for a total of ₤4.3 million. In September 2017, Mayfair acquired 9 yearlings at the yearling sale in county Kildare, Ireland for €2.3 million in total. In partnership with MV Magnier, they bought a filly at Tattersalls for ₤1.68 million in October 2017. In 2017 he was named Equus SA's racehorse owner of the year for the 10th time in a row.\n\nAs of December 2017 Mayfair Speculators owned 350 horses in training, 100 mares for breeding, a considerable property portfolio, a 49% share in Klawervlei horse-breeding farm at Bonnievale, and Steinhoff shares which were used as collateral. Mayfair Speculators was also a shareholder in Cape Thoroughbred Sales (CTS), of which Jooste was a director.\n\nJooste is married to Ingrid, and they have a son and two daughters. He lives in Stellenbosch.\n"}
{"id": "1641144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1641144", "title": "Mushroom management", "text": "Mushroom management\n\nMushroom management, also known as Pseudo-Analysis or Blind Development, is a mocking term used to describe the running of a company where the communication channels between the managers and the employees do not work properly. The term alludes to the stereotypical (and somewhat inaccurate) view of mushroom cultivation: \"Kept in the dark and periodically given a load of manure\".\n\nMushroom management is a style of management in which the personnel are not familiar with the ideas or the general state of the company, and are given work without knowing the purpose of this work, in contrast with open-book management. Mushroom management means that workers' curiosity and self-expression are not supported. The employees often have no idea what the company's overall situation is, because the leaders tend to make all the decisions on their own, without asking anyone else to give their opinion. This problem can occur when the manager does not understand the employees' work (in a programming company, for example) and therefore cannot communicate effectively with the employees. \nMushroom management can also be found in environments that are unrelated to business. It can sometimes be found within schools, when students working in a group decide not to share information with the other students in the group. This means that they will appear more intelligent and hardworking during assessments.\n\nThe main reasons for the development of mushroom management within a company can be found at the managerial level. Mushroom management often develops when managers see themselves as the sole decision-makers within the company, rather than the people who lead all the employees towards a shared success. This can often take place unintentionally: managers fear that their employees will discover important new ideas instead of them, which drives the managers to make bad decisions and prevent employees from taking an active role in their work. As a result, the employees end up doing this work in a mechanical, repeated fashion, without contributing in a more productive or active way.\n\nThe key feature of mushroom management is that the employees have limited responsibility over the company. The importance of the decisions they have to make is minimal, which can often reduce workplace-related stress.\n\nThe consequences of mushroom management can be extremely detrimental for everyone involved in the company. If the flow of information within a company is insufficient, the people involved often have a limited understanding of how to react in situations that require quick assessment and prompt decision making.\nFor example, a company that makes and sells shoes might research their customers' preferences and discover that these preferences have changed. However, if this piece of information is not passed on to the sales manager of an individual shop, then the shop will still display the \"old\" shoes and will not attract the customers' attention effectively. At the end of this process, the blame is sometimes even attributed to the shop assistants, because they are the employees in a direct contact with the customers.\n\nDuring the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, considerable information about the bank's management was revealed, including the way Richard S. Fuld, Jr., the former CEO, organised the bank. The bank had started to concentrate more and more on excessively risky mortgages; however, neither the employees nor the public were aware of the bank's financial situation. Fuld, together with other managers, had kept a significant amount of essential information secret, as well as lying to the investors and to all other involved parties. Everybody else had thought that Lehman Brothers were involved with a variety of investments, including both safe and risky investments; in reality, though, they had been working with a much more risky portfolio than was appropriate. After the bank became bankrupt, Fuld refused to take the blame for any of these events, even though he was responsible for the concealment of the information. \n\nMushroom management can also occur during the handling of one-off, individual situations. When the ship \"Titanic\" hit an iceberg, only a few members of the crew were aware that the ship was going to sink. Most of the crewmen were not informed about the seriousness of the situation by the captain, which resulted in chaos and disorganisation. The captain attempted to act on his own, without incorporating the officers into his decisions.\n\nSharing information with co-workers and employees is often unavoidable; however, one of the most important tasks for a manager is to differentiate between information that can be shared with others and information that cannot be shared. A company should not share all its information with its employees, because that could be even more damaging. Managers should learn how to distribute information and how to communicate with the people they are responsible for. The best way to avoid mushroom management is transparency.\n\nSometimes, mushroom management can be very helpful if it is handled carefully. This method involves the company's employees being divided into various groups, each of which has all the information which it specifically needs but nothing more, similar to a need to know approach taken in the military to control access to sensitive material. Meanwhile, the manager is in charge of giving each group the required information. This kind of management is extremely difficult, though, and requires considerable skill.\n\nThe term refers to the stereotypical view of mushroom cultivation, where mushrooms are \"kept in the dark and periodically given a load of manure\". In fact, the most commonly cultivated mushroom, \"Agaricus bisporus\" is grown on a pasteurized compost substrate, not raw manure (common raw ingredients in mushroom compost are horse manure and straw). The chemical and microbiological nature of finished compost is, however, quite different from raw manure.\n\nMushrooms are fungi rather than plants and therefore do not use photosynthesis. They can grow without light, but do not actually require darkness in order to grow. Most mushroom cultivation is in fact done in dark locations (such as caves) for reasons of utility and to save on the expense of lighting, or, as with the case of the aforementioned \"Agaricus bisporus\", for appearance reasons. Light tends to give the mushrooms a brownish tint. Marketing research has shown the overwhelming customer preference for lighter specimens, so most of the producers try to limit light exposure. Some cultivated mushroom species, however, may need periodic exposure to light in order to induce fruition.\n\n"}

His father was Lutheran minister Daniel Isenberg (1807–1875), and mother was Dorothea (Strauch) Isenberg (1808–1871).\nHe came to the Hawaiian Islands in 1858, and became known as Paul Isenberg.\n\nIsenberg moved to the island of Kauai and first worked in Wailua. \nIn October 1861 he married Hannah \"Maria\" Rice, daughter of William Harrison Rice, who was born February 17, 1842, and died April 7, 1867.\nThey had two children, Mary Dorothea Rice Isenberg (1862–1949) and Daniel Paul Rice Isenberg (1866–1919) known as \"Paul Jr.\"\nHe traveled back to Germany in 1869 where he married Beta Margarete Glade (born 1846) before returning to Hawaii. They had six more children: Johannes \"John\" Carl Isenberg (born September 12, 1870), Heinrich Alexander Isenberg (born January 17, 1872), Julie Maria Pauline (Isenberg) Barckhausen (born November 1876), Clara Margarete (Isenberg) Wendroth (born 1878), Richard Menno Isenberg (born 1880) and Paula Bertha Johanna Isenberg (born 1883).\n\nIsenberg took over managing the sugarcane plantation at Līhuʻe in 1862, after the death of his father-in-law who was previous manager.\nThe plantation was founded by diplomat Henry A. Peirce, but struggled to make a profit until Rice built an irrigation system.\nIsenberg made improvements to the cane sugar mill such as using an evaporating pan and steam pipes to concentrate the cane juice.\nIn 1872 the Lihue Plantation company was officially incorporated, and the expanded by at Hanamāʻulu.\nOn January 24, 1874 he was appointed to the upper House of Nobles in the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom by King Lunalilo.\nHe officially became a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii at that time.\nIn 1877 he bought equipment for a new mill from George Norton Wilcox and installed it at Hanamāʻulu to be managed by Albert Spencer Wilcox.\n\nIn 1878 Isenberg retired as plantation manager, but kept an ownership interest while moving his family back to Bremen in Germany. He visited the islands at least every two years for legislative sessions. His brother Carl Isenberg then managed the plantation.\nIn 1881 Isenberg became a business partner with earlier German merchant Heinrich Hackfeld in his Hackfeld & Company.\nAlthough most other plantation laborers were Chinese or Japanese, Isenberg arranged for groups of workers from Bremen to settle on his company's plantations.\nIn the 1887 session of the legislature, he was one of the few who objected to the threat of military force that caused the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii to be called the \"Bayonet Constitution\".\n\nHe died in Bremen on January 16, 1903.\n\nHackfeld & Company grew to be one of the \"Big Five\" corporations that dominated the economy of the Territory of Hawaii.\nDuring World War I, Hackfeld & Company was seized by the U.S. government Alien Property Custodian along with other assets owned by Germans. It was sold to a consortium of Hawaii businessmen in 1918, who changed the name to \"American Factors\" and the company's store Liberty House. A 1920 lawsuit argued the price was below market value, and some former stockholders including John Carl Isenberg recovered some damages.\nIn 1966, the name was further shortened to Amfac, Inc.\n\nHis son Paul Jr. married Annie Beatrice McBryde, daughter of neighboring sugar planter Duncan McBryde on October 19, 1891. On August 31, 1891 Queen Liliuokalani appointed him to the Privy Council. From 1898 to 1915 he was elected as representative to the house of representatives of the Territory of Hawaii, and from 1902 to 1905 the senate.\nHe married Bertha Koepke on August 9, 1916, and they had one child, Dorothea \"Dora\" Jane Isenberg (1917–1988), who married Joseph Cole.\nCole was first manager of the Kauai Museum in 1960. \nIn 1887 his younger brother Johannes Friedrich Wilhelm \"Hans\" Isenberg (1855–1918) was brought in to be pastor of the first Lutheran church on the island for the immigrants who starting arriving in 1881.\nHans had married his own niece, Paul's first child, Mary Dorothea Rice Isenberg, known as Dora, in 1883.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38501388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38501388", "title": "Physical Internet", "text": "Physical Internet\n\nIn transportation, the Physical Internet® refers to the combination of digital transportation networks that are deploying to replace analog road networks. As the Internet has resolved itself into niche implementations for high-speed (fiberoptics), local area networks (Wifi), and local device (BlueTooth). ET3 and Hyperloop are currently high speed examples. JPods are examples of urban networks.\n\nIn logistics, the Physical Internet is an open global logistics system founded on physical, digital, and operational interconnectivity, through encapsulation, interfaces and protocols. The Physical Internet is intended to replace current logistical models. The project currently has funding from the National Science Foundation as well as contributions from MHIA and CICMHE.\n\nThe Physical Internet Initiative's manifesto is \"Transforming the way physical objects are handled, moved, stored, realized, supplied and used, aiming towards global logistics efficiency and sustainability.\" It attempts to achieve this by applying concepts from internet data transfer to real-world shipping processes.\n\nThe Digital Internet does not transmit information: it transmits packets with embedded information. These packets are designed for ease of use in the Digital Internet. The information within a packet is encapsulated and is not dealt with by Internet. The packet header contains all information required for identifying the packet and routing it correct to destination. A packet is constructed for a specific transmission and it is dismantled once it has reached its destination. The Digital Internet is based on a protocol structuring data packets independently from equipment. In this way, data packets can be processed by different systems and through various networks: modems, copper wires, fiber optic wires, routers, etc.; local area networks, wide area networks, etc.; Intranets, Extranets, Virtual Private Networks, etc.\n\nThe Physical Internet does not manipulate physical goods directly, whether they are materials, parts, merchandises or yet products. It manipulates exclusively containers that are explicitly designed for the Physical Internet and that encapsulate physical goods within them.\n\nThe vision of the Physical Internet involves encapsulating goods in smart, ecofriendly and modular containers ranging from the size of a maritime container to the size of a small box. It thus generalizes the maritime container that succeeded to support globalization and shaped ships and ports, and extends containerization to logistics services in general. The Physical Internet moves the border of the private space to be inside of the container instead of the warehouse or the truck. These modular containers will be continuously monitored and routed, exploiting their digital interconnection through the Internet of Things.\n\nThe Physical Internet encapsulates physical objects in physical packets or containers, hereafter termed π-containers so as to differentiate them from current containers. These π-containers are world-standard, smart, green and modular containers. They are notably modularized and standardized worldwide in terms of dimensions, functions and fixtures.\nThe π-containers are key elements enabling the interoperability necessary for the adequate functioning of the Physical Internet. They must be designed to facilitate their handling and storage in the physical nodes of the Physical Internet, as well as their transport between these nodes and of course to protect goods. They act as packets in the digital Internet. They have an information part analogous to the header in the digital Internet. The π-containers encapsulate their content, making the contents irrelevant to the Physical Internet.\n\nFrom a physical perspective, π-containers must be easy to handle, store, transport, seal, snap to a structure, interlock, load, unload, build and dismantle.\n\nFrom an informational perspective, each π-container has a unique worldwide identifier, such as the MAC address in the Ethernet network and the digital Internet. This identifier is attached to each π-container both physically and digitally for ensuring identification robustness and efficiency. A smart tag is attached to each π-container to act as its representing agent. It contributes to ensuring π-container identification, integrity, routing, conditioning, monitoring, traceability and security through the Physical Internet. Such smart tagging enables the distributed automation of a wide variety of handling, storage and routing operations. In order to deal adequately with privacy and competitiveness concerns within the Physical Internet, the smart tag of a π-container strictly restricts information access by pertinent parties. Only the information necessary for the routing of π-containers through the Physical Internet are accessible for everyone.\n\nEstablishing the logistics system gain efficiency of the Physical Internet\nwas the focus of a research project funded by the U.S. National Science\nFoundation (NSF) and conducted in the Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). The project found that the expected annual benefits of the Physical Internet, if adopted in the U.S., would be: a reduction in costs of over $100B, a reduction in CO emissions of over 200 Tg, and a reduction in driver turnover of up to 75% .\n\nThe objective of Modulushca project is to achieve the first genuine contribution to the development of interconnected logistics at the European level, in close coordination with North American partners and the international Physical Internet Initiative. The goal of the project is to enable operations with developed iso-modular logistics units of sizes adequate for real modal and co-modal flows of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), providing a basis for an interconnected logistics system for 2030. Modulushca will establish a robust and replicable methodology to develop and evaluate solutions for interconnected logistics looking at other elements of the supply chain. Two implementation pilots will be executed integrating key Modulushca developments in significantly different supply chains.\n\nThe Modulushca project aims to develop a new interconnected logistics organization based on containerization for FMCG supply chains. This new organization is motivated by the prominence of FMCG for Europe as an industry and as end consumer markets.\n\nThe analysis of FMCG supply chains shows dedicated, overlapped networks leading to fragmented flows of goods across Europe despite huge volumes. Actual operations of FMCG supply chains raise several issues relative to utilization of assets such as transportation means and warehouses; end customer service levels; ecological footprint with growing GHG emissions and materials wastes; and social responsibility with painful jobs. The main hypothesis explored here is that these facts are induced by the contemporary design of supply networks and operations. Thus a new logistic concept is required to solve these issues: the Physical Internet. This concept aims to change logistics as the Digital Internet changed computer networks. The Physical Internet is a new way to design more open and interconnected logistics networks and services, leading to a more efficient and sustainable way of moving, storing, realizing, supplying and using physical goods in general, including FMCGs.\n\nThe interconnection of logistics services is motivated by the inefficiency and the unsustainability of our current logistics organization, putting at risk the very core of our lifestyle. Transportation is a major problem with many negative well-known side effects such as oil dependency, CO2 emissions, congestion, and health-related issues for logistics personnel. Despite all efforts already undertaken to improve engine technologies, the flows are still growing, resulting in CO2 emissions growing too.\n\nAt least two approaches are currently explored to tackle this Global Logistics Sustainability Grand Challenge. These approaches focus on logistics organization and they are based on the fact that to significantly improve the use of transportation, handling and storage means we need to re-establish the economies of scale that today are diluted by smaller, dedicated networks, as well as Just-in-Time replenishment policies.\n\nThe scope of MODULUSHCA project is:\n\nModulushca efforts will lead to the development of a road map towards a fully interconnected logistics system by 2030. The road map will address the changes and necessary steps to change the logistics system gradually, exploiting progresses in digital, physical and operational interconnectivity, building on current players, assets and infrastructures.\n\nAn international consortium coordinated by PTV Group leads the project, with relevant partners as the companies Procter&Gamble, Chep, Jan de Rijk Logistics and Poste Italiane; the Universities of Graz, TU Berlin, Laval and Lausanne; the research centers ILIM, ITENE and MINES PARISTECH; and the consultancies Inception Consulting, Kirsen Global Security and Meware SRL.\n\nThe goal of the project ATROPINE (Fast Track to the Physical Internet) is to demonstrate a Physical Internet region in Upper Austria. Researchers and industry partners join forces to design a Physical Internet model region with an open logistics system that follows standardized protocols. \n\nThrough this ATROPINE project Upper Austrian businesses have the opportunity to be amongst the first to get to know new technologies, products and solutions in the Physical Internet research and business area. The project findings will show how companies can optimize transport costs through cooperation and how they can simultaneously increase productivity.

It was founded in 1947 by combining the American Council on Public Relations and the National Association of Public Relations Councils. That year it had its first annual conference and award ceremony. In the 1950s and 1960s, the society created its code of conduct, accreditation program and a student society called the Public Relations Student Society of America. In the 1970s and 1980s, its membership attained a stronger female demographic and the society had its first female Presidents. PRSA created a definition of public relations in 1982, which was updated with a crowd-sourced version in 2011.\n\nPRSA is governed by a Leadership Assembly that consists of delegates representing its membership, a board of directors and various committees and task forces. Positions are elected and served on a volunteer basis. PRSA hosts an accreditation program, industry awards, networking events and a code of conduct. PRSA also advocates on behalf of the public relations industry for changes in education and for the credibility of the profession.\n\nThe Public Relations Society of America was formed in 1947 by combining the American Council on Public Relations and the National Association of Public Relations Councils. The society had its first annual conference in Philadelphia, where Richard Falk was given PRSA's first \"annual citation\" for advancing the field of public relations. Several ethical violations in the field led to discussions about ethics within the society. At the 1952 annual conference, a speaker used Adolf Hitler as an example of the potential abuse of communications. The society published its first code of conduct and its first Anvil awards two years later. The code of conduct was later ratified in 1959 and again in 1963. PRSA merged with the American Public Relations Association in 1961 and started its accreditation program for public relations professionals the next year. The Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) was created in 1967 based on suggestions by Professor Walter Seifer of Ohio State University.\n\nIn the 1970s to early 1980s, PRSA's female membership base increased, coinciding with more women pursuing a career in the field. PRSA had its first female President in 1972 and a second female President in 1983. In 1981, 78 percent of PRSA's student society were women, up from 38 percent in 1968. The society grew to 9,000 members by 1981, up from 4,500 members in 1960. In 1977, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said PRSA's code of conduct inhibited fair competition by requiring members not to solicit clients from other members. It issued a consent order that required PRSA to remove content from its code of conduct that contained sexist language, discouraged soliciting clients from other members or encouraged price-fixing activities. PRSA's first definition of public relations was created in 1982 as \"Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other.” In 1986, PRSA's then President Anthony Franco resigned from his post after it was revealed he was accused of insider trading by the Securities Exchange Commission. The PRSA's philanthropy arm, the PRSA Foundation, was founded in 1990.\n\nIn 1994 O'Dwyer from the O'Dwyer's PR trade journal alleged that PRSA was violating copyright laws by lending articles from \"USA Today\", \"The New York Times\", \"O'Dwyer's\" and others to members. Although O'Dwyer has been a critic of PRSA since the 1970s, this is often considered the beginning of a long-term dispute between PRSA and O'Dwyer that \"PR News\" described as a \"never-ending back-and-forth.\" In 1996 and 2011 O'Dwyer criticized PRSA on issues such as financial transparency, auditing and spending in the context of proposed increases in membership dues. PRSA said the increases were caused by an increase in services to members.\n\nIn 2000, PRSA and the Institute of Public Relations signed a mutual declaration saying the two would work together in areas like ethics, education, accreditation, professional development and new media. The society started two efforts to revise its definition of public relations in 2003 and 2007, but neither moved forward. In November 2011, PRSA led an initiative called Public Relations Defined, in order to create a crowd-sourced definition of public relations. 927 submissions were made on PRSA's website filling in the blanks to the statement: \"Public relations (does what) with or for (whom) to (do what) for (what purpose).” The winning definition was: \"a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organisations and their bodies.\" According to the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) \"reactions to the new PRSA definition were mixed and views vigorously debated.\"\n\nIn 2011 PRSA publicized accusations that O'Dwyer had been eavesdropping on PRSA's conference calls. Later that year PRSA started refusing O'Dwyer entrance to their events and sent a 23-page letter to O'Dwyer describing his behavior as disruptive and unethical. The National Press Club tried to negotiate his entrance unsuccessfully.\n\nPRSA is organized as a 501(c)(6) not-for-profit organization and governed by a set of bylaws. A Chair is nominated each year and elected based on a vote of the Leadership Assembly. The Leadership Assembly consists of one delegate for every 100 members, as well as anyone that holds an elected office. Elected positions within PRSA are held on a volunteer-basis. A Board of Directors can propose membership fee changes that must be approved by the assembly. The board has the authority to create or dissolve task forces and committees as well as revoke or reward membership status. PRSA's Board of Ethics and Professional Standards and the Universal Accreditation Board make recommendations on the code of conduct and accreditation programs respectively. PRSA has more than 100 chapters in ten districts, 300 student chapters and 14 interest groups.\n\nSince the 1970s, the PRSA had restricted the right to sit in the group's national assembly or to seek election to the national board to those possessing an APR certification. The requirement for the assembly was dropped in 2004, but was maintained for those seeking board membership. In 2010 a revolt led by Richard Edelman and a group calling itself \"the Committee for a Democratic PRSA\" called for the restriction to be scrapped. The attempt to overturn the rule was defeated in a vote during that year's session of the assembly. In 2003 a proposal to amend the society's bylaws to allow non-accredited professionals to run for PRSA's offices was defeated, but the motion passed the following year.\n\nPRSA members receive access to a suite of tools that fosters professional development and career growth. PRSA hosts an accreditation program called APR (accreditation in public relations) that evaluates a PR professional in four categories: research, planning, implementation and evaluation. Accreditation is usually granted to candidates with five to seven years of experience upon completion of written and oral examinations. About 20 percent of PRSA's members are accredited. PRSA hosts the Anvil awards, which are issued based on four components: research, planning, execution and evaluation. The Gold Anvil is awarded to individuals. The Silver Anvil is awarded for strategy and the Bronze for tactics. It also issues awards such as Grand Gold Pick, Rookie of the Year, Lifetime Achievement and PR person of the year.\n\nPRSA's \"Public Relations Journal\" was published from October 1945 to 1995. Its original mission statement was \"to carry articles that deal with fundamental public relations problems, as they currently press for solution.\" The journal was comparable to a text-heavy academic periodical. PRSA still publishes \"The Strategist\" and \"Tactics\". \"The Strategist\" is a quarterly glossy magazine intended for executives, while \"Tactics\" is a monthly news tabloid.\n\nThe Public Relations Society of America publishes a code of ethics. Members that violate the code may have their membership revoked, usually under its mandate that members \"not engage in any practice which tends to corrupt the integrity of channels of public communication\" and that members act \"in accord with public welfare.\" The code also expects PRSA members to identify the source of their communications, avoid derogatory methods and avoid abusing insider information. According to the code of conduct, members should \"protect and advance the free flow of accurate and truthful information; foster informed decision-making through open communication... and work to strengthen the public's trust in the profession.\" The code states that members \"adhere to the highest standards of accuracy and truth.\" A story in CBS criticized the code: \"Show me a PR person who is 'accurate' and 'truthful,' and I'll show you a PR person who is unemployed.\" The code of ethics has been revised in 1954, 1959, 1963, 1977, 1983, 1988 and 2000.\n\nThe Public Relations Society of America and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication commissioned studies in 1975 and 1987 on the state of public relations in education. They found that too many classes were taught by educators with little or no experience in the field and that most didn't have a post-graduate degree. Several standards in education were established by the studies, including that 75 percent of coursework for PR professionals be outside the major. In 1991, PRSA hosted a Task Force on the Structure and Role on Public Relations, which found that public relations teachers still lacked practical experience. In 1993 PRSA published a Professional Career Guide, which classified skills and knowledge that were needed at five different levels of someone's career. PRSA also advocates that MBA programs include communications programs, so business executives will be more prepared for a crisis.\n\nPRSA advocates for the trust, credibility and respect of public relations as a profession, believing that PR can facilitate open communication that allows for an informed public and supports the democratic process. In 1999, a National Credibility Index from PRSA found that PR professionals were among the least credible of professions as a spokesperson. The PRSA objected to the actions of the Redner Group in 2011, when the PR firm threatened to blacklist media that gave Duke Nukem negative reviews. In 2012 a Senate subcommittee investigated the communications and advertising spend of eleven government agencies. PRSA opposed the investigation, presenting that the effort dismissed the value of public relations in government.\n\n"}

At the beginning of the 1980s, he took command of a small biotech company, Fermenta, which he quickly turned into one of the success stories of the Stockholm stock exchange. El-Sayed soon became Sweden's richest man, and made the fortune of his employees and shareholders. A charismatic leader, he was a favourite of the media, and in December 1985 he was named \"Swede of the year\" by the TV news program \"Rapport\". The following month, Fermenta announced a partnership with Swedish industrial giant Volvo. El-Sayed was at the peak of his fame.\n\nThe fall from grace was brutal: just one month later, El-Sayed was accused of lying about his academic qualifications, as he had falsely asserted he was a Doctor of Science. The partnership with Volvo was broken. In 1992, El-Sayed became the CEO of another biotech company, Hebi Health Care.\n\nEl-Sayed was born 11 February 1946 in a small town in Northern Egypt. As a teenager, he showed an early interest in microbiology. He immigrated to Sweden in 1966, and started working as a laboratory assistant at the Fiskeby paper mill in Norrköping. He then resumed his studies, at first in Stockholm, before joining the University of Agricultural Sciences at Ultuna near Uppsala.\n\nAfter a few years, he left Sweden for the United States, where he worked as a consultant for SDS Biotech, and studied at UC Davis in California. This helped him build a relationship network, which would become handy in later stages of his career. His ambition was to start a biotechnology company, and to develop his inventions and patents in the field of water purification. In the mid-1970s, he acquired his first company, which he renamed Mikrokem.\n\nIn 1981, he turned his attention to Fermenta, a subsidiary of Astra located in Strängnäs near Stockholm. Fermenta's main output was raw materials used for the production of antibiotics, an activity considered at the time of low strategic value. It was an ageing, money losing business, which Astra was eager to get rid of. El-Sayed became the new owner after taking a loan of one million kronor from Handelsbanken. But in order to develop itself, Fermenta needed even more money, and El-Sayed decided to go public, at a time that marked the start of a bull run for the Stockholm stock exchange.\n\nIn the first half of the 1980s, the Fermenta stock price rose steadily, which allowed El-Sayed to embark on a campaign of acquisition. In early 1985, he notably bought Pierrel from Italian industrial Vittorio de Nora. Pierrel's activities were diversified; they included pharmacy, with the production of antibiotics, chemicals, with aspartam, etc... El-Sayed's plan was to retain only the activities he was interested in, and to sell other operations for a profit. Through this campaign of acquisition, he was hoping to turn Fermenta into a giant in the biotechnology sector. Just after taking the control of Pierrel, El-Sayed presented his new board of directors, which included big names of the Swedish business scene, such as Ove Sundberg from KemaNobel, Gösta Bystedt and Simon Liliedahl from Electrolux, and advertising guru Leon Nordin.\n\nAfter an aborted attempt at buying Swedish giant Kabi Vitrum, El-Sayed turned his attention to the American firm for which he had worked in the 1970s: he bought SDS Biotech for 500 million kronor. The Fermenta stock price rose from 85 to 230 kronor between January and December 1985. The Swedish media started to show interest in the Fermenta phenomenon – it had taken only a few years for the company to become a major actor in the pharmaceutical industry. El-Sayed was presented as an unusual corporate leader: at barely 10 000 kronor, his salary was at par with that of a worker of the Strängnäs plant, he was living in a flat in the outskirts of Stockholm, and he played amateur football in the Swedish third division. On 22 December 1985, the TV news program \"Rapport\" named him « Swede of the year » for his success as Fermenta's chief, for his unconventional management style, and for « putting the light on the important role played by immigrants in the Swedish society. »\n\nOn 8 January 1986, El-Sayed appeared in front of TV cameras besides Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, the most powerful man in Sweden's industry. Volvo and Fermenta announced a deal, through which Volvo was exchanging its participations in two pharmaceutical companies, Soneson and Pharmacia, against a 20% stake in Fermenta. With this deal, Fermenta was becoming a world giant in the pharmaceutical industry, with a market capitalisation of four billion kronor. The news made the front page of the Financial Times. It was said that it had taken El-Sayed only 10 minutes to win the favours of Gyllenhammar. The Fermenta stock reached a new high at 325 kronor, while El-Sayed was at the peak of his glory. He would remain there for a little over a month.\n\nIn February 1986, researcher and environmental activist Björn Gillberg, whom El-Sayed knew from his time at Ultuna, publicly accused Fermenta of pollution at the site of the Strängnäs plant. Gillberg also accused El-Sayed of lying about his academic qualifications, and of falsely claiming he was a Doctor of Science. Journalists who tried to verify these allegations discovered that according to some sources, El-Sayed was awarded his Doctor degree in California, while according to others, he had earned it in Sweden.\n\nThis scandal had disastrous effects for El-Sayed and Fermenta. That he was not a Doctor was in itself a mere detail, which on one hand stripped him of the « genius » aura that had so far surrounded him, but on the other hand added to the myth of the self-made billionaire. But his 48 hours of awkward denial cost him the trust of the markets, of the business world.\n\nAfter the DSc scandal, the markets were unforgiving. The Fermenta stock price dropped, and the Volvo and Pharmacia shares were also slammed. El-Sayed was soon compelled to leave his position as CEO, while Volvo reminded in a press release that the partnership agreement was not yet finalised. Fermenta's new CEO Ove Sundberg granted Volvo full access to the company's books. El-Sayed remained optimistic in his public comments, but it became clearer and clearer that Volvo was going to backtrack, which was eventually confirmed on 25 February. It was a financial disaster for El-Sayed, who had personally bought four millions of Fermenta shares with the intention of exchanging them with Pharmacia. The drop in the stock price meant he was soon riddled with debts amounting to more than a billion kronor.\n\nFor Fermenta however, optimism was still \"de rigueur:\" it showed a profit for the first quarter of 1986. But in May, . Nevertheless, two weeks later, El-Sayed made a comeback at the top of Fermenta. In the hope of clearing his debts, he attempted to sell the company to Montedison, and later to Bayer, but with no success.\n\nIn December 1986, Fermenta's auditors discovered extensive irregularities in Fermenta's financial statements. Refaat El-Sayed was sentenced to five years in prison by the district court in 1989, as well as banning him from engaging in commercial activities on charges of fraud, gross indebtedness against creditors, unfair benefit of creditors and breaches of the Securities Market Act. In the following year, the Sveahov Court raised the sentence to six years. El-Saayed was released in 1992. Fermenta's board was also sentenced to daily fines for environmental crime.\n\nEl-Sayed's charisma had not yet vanished: Hebi Health Care soon gathered 45 000 shareholders, and its market capitalisation reached one half billion kronor.Hebi Health Care relocated part of its activities to Egypt.\n\nP3 dokumentär om Fermenta\n\nOn 22 October 2006, the Swedish radio station P3 broadcast a documentary produced by Kristofer Hansson and Fredrik Johnsson about the Fermenta story.\nOther references\n\nThe New York Times (and others) wrote many articles about El-Sayed and Fermenta during the 1980s.\n"}

One of the leading industrial and research centers with emphasis in aerospace sciences in Latin America, the city is located in the Paraíba Valley, between the two most active production and consumption regions in the country, São Paulo ( from the city) and Rio de Janeiro (). It is the main city of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte. A native of São José dos Campos is called a \"joseense\" ().\n\nSource: City administration website (in Portuguese) \n\n\nThe municipality comprises three districts: São José dos Campos — the city itself, (also the seat), Eugênio de Melo and São Francisco Xavier. The last one is known for its natural sites and ecotourism.\n\nThe district of São José dos Campos is also subdivided into 2 subdistricts (São José dos Campos and Santana do Paraíba).\n\nHowever, for administrative purposes, the city is composed of 7 urban regions: Center, North, South, West, East, Southeast and São Francisco Xavier.\n\nHighlands predominate in the northern region of the municipality with altitudes ranging from . The northern border of the municipality lies over the Serra da Mantiqueira Mountains (\"Mantiqueira Range\"), with some peaks reaching over 2000 meters (6500 ft.). The highest point in the municipality is known as 'Pico do Selado' at an altitude of 2082 meters.\n\nIn the urban area, there are rolling plateaus and hills.\nThe lowest elevation in the city (and also in the municipality) is found in the \"Paraíba do Sul\" river, at an elevation of 550 m.\n\nThe municipality is bounded at the south by the 'Serra do Jambeiro' mountains, with an elevation of about 900m.\n\n\nThe municipality holds the São Francisco Xavier Environmental Protection Area, established in 2002.\nIt contains part of the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Environmental Protection Area, created in 1982 to protect the sources of the Paraiba do Sul river.\n\nThe climate of the city can be, perhaps, best described as a mix between the subtropical climate of southern parts of the country, the tropical climate of most of the country and the subtropical highland climate (in Portuguese: clima tropical de altitude) of neighbouring mountainous regions.\n\nTechnically, the city has a humid subtropical climate with significant less precipitation during winters (transitioning between \"Cfa\" and \"Cwa\" climatic types in the Köppen classification). Winters are very mild, with average temperature in the coldest month of 17 °C. Summers are not excessively hot, with average temperature of the hotttest month of 24 °C. With global warming it is very likely that the city's climate will transition to a true tropical climate (type 'Aw' in the Köppen climate classification) in the near future.\n\nFrosts are very rare, happening on average once per decade. There's no record of snow precipitation in the city.\n\nThe peaks at the northern border of the municipality (some over 2000 m high) due to altitude have a colder Cwb/Cfb climates, with very occasional snowfalls (about once per decade).\n\nThe origins of São José dos Campos lie at the end of the 16th Century when Jesuits founded a cattle farm, \"Aldeia do Rio Comprido\". The farm was created through a concession of settlements around 1590 to the Society of Jesus. The farm was located on the banks of the Rio Comprido, natural division between São José and the city of Jacareí today.\n\nThe farm status was an artifice to hide a religious outpost, one of the several Jesuit Reductions in Brazil, known for their resistance to enslavement, from the Portuguese expedition leaders and indigenous people hunters, known as the Bandeirantes.\n\nOn September 10, 1611, the local was officially recognized and the farmers precluded from utilizing the Natives as slaves. However, a turmeric conflict between farmers and the religious led to the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1640 from the region and the consequent dispersion of the mission.\n\nNevertheless, the Jesuits returned and reestablished a new settlement, where the current city center is spotted. It was about northeast of the previous mission, on a higher plain with a privileged view above a geological depression, which guaranteed security against invasions and floods. Again, despite being a new mission, it was officially treated as a cattle farm.\n\nThe initial urbanization plan is attributed to the Jesuit priest Manoel de Leão, whose main occupation was really to be an administrator of the community.\n\nIn 1692, documents named the village as \"Residência do Paraíba do Sul\"; in 1696 as \"Residência de São José\".\n\nAt the beginning of the gold mining economic cycle in Brazil, the settlement goes through serious difficulties due to the exit of labor to the mines.\n\nAfter the definitive expulsion of Jesuits from the Portuguese Empire in 1759, all the religious order's assets, such as farms, colleges and villages were taken under the Portuguese Crown's custody. The governor, D. Luis Antonio Botelho Mourão, had as a priority to turn these new assets into productive units and increase tax collection. For that, Boutelho Mourão successfully requested authorization from the Viceroy to create civil parishes, known as \"freguesias\", and to change the fiscal status of villages to the category of Vila (town).\n\nThen, on July 27, 1767, São José reached the official status of town, with a hall and a pillory, passing over the status of civil parish; and the name Vila de São José do Paraíba was formalized. But for many years it maintained the same rural characteristics. The main difficulty was the fact that the \"Estrada Real\" (Royal Road) passed by its limits, far from the village.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the village of São José do Paraíba had demonstrated some signs of economic growth through the development of agriculture. Cotton production evolved rapidly in the region, exported to the English textile industry. The production reached a peak in 1864.\n\nIn the same year, on April 22, the town became the seat of a municipality, acquiring finally, in 1871, the current name of São José dos Campos, followed by the creation of a judiciary district in 1872. Almost simultaneously, there was development of coffee crops in Paraíba Valley, which started to take off in 1870.\n\nIn 1886, after the opening of the Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil railway (1877), the coffee production peaked. Then started to decay, running steady until the 1930s.\n\nThe call for the municipality of São José dos Campos for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis by sanatoriums became noticed at the\n\nbeginning of last century, due to its supposedly favorable climate conditions. The city became to be known as \"the Sanatorium City\". The country's then-largest hospital, the Vicentina Aranha Sanitarium, was opened in town in 1924, and in 1935 the municipality was officially recognized as a health retreat.\n\nWith the advent of antibiotics in the 1940s, tuberculosis begins to be treated anywhere, thus ending the healthcare advantage carried out by São José, whereas the establishment of industries was about just to start.\n\nThe industrialization process of the municipality takes hold from the installation of the \"Technological Institute of Aeronautics \" in 1950 and also with the opening of the Dutra Highway (BR-116), thus making possible a faster connection between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo and cutting into the urban area of São José dos Campos. Altogether, these factors allowed the municipality to make strides towards fulfilling its scientific and technological potential.\n\nSão José dos Campos has a \"strong mayoral\" system in which the mayor is vested with extensive executive powers, as it is in all municipalities in Brazil. The mayor is elected to a four-year term by universal voting. The City Council is elected every four years with the mayor. The current mayor is Felicio Ramuth, from the political party PSDB and was elected in 2016.\n\nThe State of São Paulo is divided politically and administratively into 15 regions. São José dos Campos is the seat and the name of the 3rd Administrative Region, which includes the North Coast of São Paulo state and the Paraíba Valley.\n\nThe region comprises 39 municipalities with sharp contrasts. São José dos Campos is a densely populated city, with approximately 2,100 inhabitants/square kilometers in urban area, whereas the quiet municipality of São José do Barreiro has only seven inhabitants/square kilometer. There are both highly industrialized cities and the others in the region are focused on agriculture and tourism. São José dos Campos is well known as the \"Capital do Vale\" which means that São José dos Campos is the most important city of the Paraíba Valley.\n\nIt is one of the state's most dynamic areas, the fourth one in terms of population density, and covers 11.3% of the state's territory. The main municipalities are São José dos Campos, Taubaté, Jacareí, Guaratingueta, Caraguatatuba, Campos do Jordão, São Sebastião, Lorena, Pindamonhangaba, Ubatuba and Caçapava.\n\n\n\nAll the major hypermarkets, supermarket chains and discount and department stores are in city. The largest malls are:\n\n\nBesides those malls, the most important commercial centers include:\n\n\nAnd newer areas such as:\n\n\nThe Vila Ema district has sites for nightlife including bars and restaurants.\n\nSeveral fairs and expositions are done at the two pavilions located in the city.\n\nA list of notable sites:\n\n\n\nA Japanese garden is open for visits within the Santos-Dumont Park, celebrating the sister cities.\n\nAlthough São José is an industrial center, the city still preserves green areas and quiet town districts. Around 62% of the area from the municipality is characterized as an environmental preservation area. On the oustskirts of the urban area, Augusto Ruschi Ecology Reserve has many local plant species. The natural reserve has , being a government protect area for the local flora. São Francisco Xavier is a community the offers many of those attributes as well.\n\nFurthermore, there is easy access to the mountain cities (Campos do Jordão, Santo Antônio do Pinhal) and to the beaches of the Northern Coast of São Paulo.\n\nThe city has three parks and several sports and country clubs. Tenis Clube and Associação Esportiva São José have hosted the 35th Banana Bowl International Tennis Federation Juniors Circuit in 2005 and 2006. \n\nA soccer stadium, called Estádio Martins Pereira, is the home ground of São José Esporte Clube, a professional soccer team.\n\nNotable teams from the city:\n\nThere are 19 movie theaters and 2 theaters including one inside the Univap - University of Vale do Paraíba.\n\nThe Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) has its headquarters in São José dos Campos. It coordinates intensive research and development in areas such as Earth observation, space sciences and space technologies. Also the Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology (CTA) has its facilities in the city. There are 53 secondary schools, 54 primary schools and 109 preschools.\n\n\n\n\nThe city has two bus stations, having lines to cities in all regions of the country and international routes to Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile.\n\nSão José dos Campos boasts an extensive bus system. Operated by three companies (Expresso Maringa, Julio Simões and Viação Capital do Vale), these lines serve nearly all areas in the city with 319 buses. São José dos Campos also has an alternative system with minivans to supplement the regular buses.\n\nThe city uses a ring road system, that interconnects it to important national and state highways:\n\n\n\nThe city is also served by a railway (the former Central do Brasil), administered by MRS Logística, which today only carries freight.\n\nThe ports of São Sebastião and Santos can be reached by the highways SP-099, SP-155, and BR-101. The transportation of cargo to the domestic and foreign markets is made through both ports.\n\nThe São José dos Campos Airport (IATA: SJK, ICAO: SBSJ) has a heavy passenger flow, mainly business trips during weekdays, and it is an important connection between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. With a runway, the airport also serves people who come to visit the tourist city of Campos de Jordão. The airlines Azul Brazilian Airlines and TRIP Linhas Aéreas fly from São José dos Campos to several destinations and presently are the only commercial airlines operating on São José dos Campos.\n\nIt is also used for the transportation of cargo from the several industries located in the so-called Cone Leste Paulista (\"São Paulo's East Cone\"). Infraero and the Federal Revenue Agency are also introducing a new concept called airport-industry, that will offer fiscal incentives and fast importation and exportation procedures. The municipality has also a Customs Station for the Hinterland (dry port), controlled by the Federal Revenue Agency.\n\nSão José dos Campos receives natural gas from two gas pipelines, and large companies such as General Motors, Kodak, Monsanto and Embraer are among the main users. The city is the third largest in the country referring to the distribution net of natural gas for residential use. \n\nIt has also a large network of fiber optics, with broadband services covering 75% of the city. There is 1 telephone for each 3 inhabitants and a vast service network of cellular telephones. \n\nThe municipality cultivates different crops: rice, tomato, potatoes, orange and many vegetables; cattle are raised for beef and milk supply. There are also farms for production of eggs and chicken. \n\nIn contrast to the rural town in 1950s, today São José is an important manufacturing center and holds a large array of industries. Over 1,251 industries are in the municipality and nearby 47,000 inhabitants work for industries. The three main industries are automotive, oil/petrochemical and aerospace. There are significant pharmaceutical, consumer durables, chemical, and telecommunication companies in the city.\n\nIt is also known as the \"Brazilian aeronautics capital\" because it is home of CTA and one of the biggest aircraft manufacturers in the world, Embraer.\n\nIn 2014 São José dos Campos ranked as the 5th largest exporter, by value, of all Brazilian municipalities exporting $4.6B (USD) worth of materials. In that year, between aircraft and aircraft parts categories, São José Dos Campos exported $3.57B (USD) or 81.9% of the total exports of the municipality.\n\nSince the 1990s, the local economy has been evolving in a different direction. The manufacturing economy has been downsized or replaced by tertiary and quaternary sectors of industries.\n\nFor instance, the Entrepreneurial District of Chacaras Reunidas concentrates companies of micro, small and medium size, which are mainly the result of downsizing from old large local industries. Yet even though most of these are industries, these companies provide service as well.\n\nTwo technological parks and five (one in project) business incubators have been created within universities or industrial facilities.\n\nThere are incubators with technological start-up companies installed at Univap and at Henrique Lage Refinery of Petrobrás. The CTA houses other incubator, Incubaero, specialized in the aeronautical field.\n\nUnivap features a technological park with capacity for around 40 small to medium-sized innovating companies in the areas of materials, electronics and telecommunications, information technology, aerospace, energy, environment control, biotechnology, bioinformatics, chemical engineering, and software among others. A new technological park, managed by the municipality and the state government of São Paulo, will house two new think tanks: the Institute for Technological Research (IPT) and the ItecBio (Instituto de Tecnologias Biomédicas).\n\nAs a result of its geographical location, the city became an important distribution center, having several logistics providers. Activities like purchasing, transport, planning and warehousing have employed many people recently.\n\nCommerce and real estate ventures have developed in the last years, reflecting the changes in the economy. For instance, the largest shopping mall in the region was an old manufacturing facility. Serving the region's population of approximately one million, the city is the regional hub for shopping and services for the Vale do Paraíba, the northern coast of São Paulo and southern Minas Gerais.\n\n"}

During his tenure, OTE became the highest-revenue state-owned enterprise in Greece. He also oversaw the completion of its large complex in Marousi and the relocation of its operations there.\n\nHe was also engaged in other businesses, and became a manufacturer, with fruit processing facilities in Argolis.\n\nTheofanis Tombras was born in 1932 in Merbaka (Agia Trias) in Argolis.<ref name=\"Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996\">Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996</ref> He graduated from the Hellenic Military Academy and joined the Signal Corps. In the 1960s, as a captain, he served in the predecessor agency to the Hellenic National Intelligence Service and was accused of being a member of the clandestine ASPIDA organization, an accusation of which he was eventually absolved, as he was of accusations of wiretapping the telephone conversations of political opponents of Andreas Papandreou.\n\nHe took part in the resistance to the Greek military junta. After the electoral victory of PASOK in October 1981, he was made a deputy governor of OTE; later in February 1984, he became its governor. After amendments to its articles of organization in 1987, his title was changed to general director.\n\nUnder his direction, a signal effort began in the area of telephone modernization, and when it was recognized by his rivals<ref name=\"Αυριανή, 9/1/1996\">Αυριανή, 9/1/1996</ref> even while they pointed out a certain concern for the reputation of the organization, they were considerably pleased by the reasoning behind the work being done. However, at certain times he was accused of high-handedness. He took the law into his own hands, to the detriment of the first president of OTE Tasos Mandelis, when he summoned the Governing Board of OTE and had a loaded pistol placed on the boardroom table, and although he arranged for armed bodyguards who were not police (as is often the case for plain-clothes bodyguards in Greece), they themselves were of dubious origin. The display of force was viewed at the time as a publicity stunt designed to intimidate journalists\n\nHe maintained a public friendship with the prime minister Andreas Papandreou, had a slight connection to well-known billionaire Sokratis Kokkalis, and with the reporters Nikos Kakaounakis (editor of the newspaper \"To Kalami\") and Makis Kouris (editor of the \"Avriani\"). Indeed, \"To Kalami\" had published on numerous occasions transcripts of cassettes that contained personal conversations of Constantine Karamanlis, and the New Democracy party had denounced Tombras as the source of those cassettes.\n\nTombras was cast out of the general directorship of OTE on 2 July 1989, that is, the same day that a new cabinet under Tzannis Tzannetakis came to power.\n\nAfter the return of the PASOK government in the summer of 1989, Tombras was accused of making deposits totaling to a then-Greek drachma equivalent of $12.5 million USD in OTE money in the Bank of Crete at below-market interest to help shore up the bank's finances, allegedly part of a scheme known as the Koskotas Scandal. Subsequently he was accused of illegal telephone wiretapping of the political opponents of PASOK. On the first charge he was acquitted, and on the second he did not arrive in court because the parliament dismissed the prosecution after the acquittal of Andreas Papandreou in the Koskotas affair and the dramatic change in the political climate in January 1992.\n\nTombras spent the last years of his life in his native Argolis, where he engaged in the fruit-processing trade, which he had originally entered in 1982. For all that, he remained active in the affairs of PASOK, especially in view of the succession of Andreas Papandreou in late 1995, where he supported Gerasimos Arsenis. He died of cardiac arrest on 8 January 1996; at the same time Andreas Papandreou was ill and being treated at the Onaseio Cardiac Centre. His funeral was attended by then-Speaker of the Parliament of Greece Apostolos Kaklamanis; then-Minister of Public Order Sifis Valirakis; then-Director of the Greek National Intelligence Service, Admiral Leonidas Vasilikopoulos; PASOK parliamentarians and party members, and Sokratis Kokkalis.\n"}

Comprising 53 buildings situated on over , U-PARC is located from Downtown Pittsburgh in Harmar Township, Pennsylvania adjacent to the Route 28 expressway and Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike.\n\nIt was founded as the research laboratories of Gulf Oil in 1933 and moved to Harmar Township in 1935. It served many decades as one of the leading industrial research centers in the world, with labs engaging in petroleum, chemical, polymer, refining, and nuclear research. At its peak, it employed over 2,000 scientists and engineers and had an annual budget of $100 million ($ in dollars). Upon Gulf Oil's acquisition by Chevron Oil in 1985, the research park was donated to the University of Pittsburgh in order to keep the center open for the benefit of the region.\n\nU-PARC is home to more than 100 different companies from around the world, including several Fortune 500 Companies. In addition, the university's Swanson School of Engineering maintains laboratories and its Manufacturing Assistance Center at the site. It also serves as the home to the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences' Masters of Science program in Physician Assistant Studies.\n\nU-PARC was founded as the research labs of Gulf Oil in 1933 in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. Work began on its current Harmar Township location in August 1934 with the opening of the first three buildings in 1935. For many decades it was one of the leading industrial research centers in the world, with labs encompassing research ranging from petroleum, chemical, polymers, refining to even nuclear applications thanks to a three million volt Van de Graaff particle accelerator. It also served for a time as the site of geophysics research by two-time winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, John Bardeen. Products developed in its labs included the airborne magnetometer, the marsh buggy, No-Nox gasoline, Gulf Spray pesticide, and processes for the hydrodesulfurization of sour crude oil and shale oil extraction. For at least the first 20 years of its existence it was the \"most highly integrated of all the petroleum research laboratories in the world\". By 1955, it employed over 1,200, and by the late 1970s, it employed 1,500. General Matthew Ridgway keynoted the dedication of three new research laboratories at the center in May, 1957 with Richard King Mellon and about 600 others in attendance.\nIn 1985 Gulf Oil was acquired by Chevron Corporation which maintained its own research facilities in Richmond, California, the complex had grown to with 54 multi-story lab buildings and employed nearly 2,000 scientists and engineers with an annual operation budget of over $100 million. The University of Pittsburgh proposed that it would be able to maintain and operate the facility in order to keep the center open for the benefit of the region. Gulf and Chevron agreed to the university's proposal and donated the site, valued at $100 million including the fully furnished and equipped laboratories, a computer telecommunications center, an executive office building, and unique facilities such as large cold room containing a wind tunnel. Chevron also added a $3 million start up grant, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania added a $3 million matching grant for economic development. The donation was announced by university Chancellor Wesley Posvar at a press conference in April, 1985. The university took over the facility in early 1986 and renamed it the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center. On March 17, 1986, the university signed its first major tenant, General Motors Corporation, to a four-year, $13 million contract and in two years was sheltering 80 small businesses.\n\nU-PARC is home to academic programs and to more than 100 companies from all over the world, including several Fortune 500 companies. U-PARC's pilot plant services range from petroleum, petrochemical, and chemical-based technologies to environmental, synthetic fuels, biotechnology, and other emerging technologies. Buildings are connected indoors throughout the campus via underground tunnels. On-site amenities include 24-hour monitored access points, free parking, catering service, meeting/conference space, a U.S. Postal Service sub-station, a credit union, ATMs, picnic areas, outdoor dining, volleyball courts, locker rooms, and shower facilities.\n\nIn addition to the companies that rent occupy the facilities at U-PARC, the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering maintains research groups and laboratories at the site, including the Manufacturing Assistance Center. Beginning in 2010, the University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences initiated a Masters of Science program in Physician Assistant Studies headquartered at U-PARC. The space for the Physician's Assistant program includes classrooms, breakout rooms, student lounge, computer room, conference room and offices for faculty and administration.\n\nThe Manufacturing Assistance Center (MAC), located in Building A-11 of U-PARC, is a working factory opened in November 1994 as an initiative of the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering's Department of Industrial Engineering that offers technical assistance and educational resources to the academic and industrial community of Western Pennsylvania. It also serves as an incubator for manufacturing innovation and as a center for technology transfer. The MAC provides access to advanced manufacturing technology, encourages its adoption, and assists in training and educating students in its use. The center comprises a synergistic network of laboratories encompassing machine tooling, computer-aided design and manufacturing, metrology, materials tracking, and human issues.\n\nThe MAC began following a 1990 survey of 550 Western Pennsylvania manufacturers by the Department of Industrial Engineering that revealed the need for manufacturing support services in this part of the state. In response a concept of shared manufacturing was created by Pitt School of Engineering professors Dr. Bopaya Bidanda and Dr. David I. Cleland, and a proposal describing how the MAC would meet this need resulted in a $2.3 million grant from the Economic Development Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The center's purpose is to provide research and educational support to the University of Pittsburgh, as well as to provide small and mid-sized manufacturers of Western Pennsylvania with the tools to compete in the global marketplace. As such, area manufacturers can receive demonstrations on new equipment and manufacturing processes, perform pilot manufacturing, and conduct limited production utilizing the resources available in the MAC labs. In addition to these services, the MAC also provides training on computer numerical control (CNC) machining, computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM), plus a variety of other concepts, such as materials requirements planning, total quality management, and team development, that are utilized by modern manufacturing organizations. Working in partnership with private industry, the MAC is part of the development of the regional RoboCorridor, promoting automation and agile robotics.\n\nThe MAC's of available space contains a working factory, classrooms, and administration offices and supplies secure space for startup companies wishing to access its facilities. The factory has a 5-ton and a 1-ton overhead crane, a loading dock, 220 and 480 volt 3-phase power, a paint room, and welding booths. The space is subdivided into classrooms, a conference room, a computer laboratory designed for CAD/CAM training, offices and training areas for manual, welding training, and CNC and EDM machine tool and precision grinding training. The facility also includes two classrooms seating 24 and 12 students, respectively, as well as five offices, a metrology lab, and a computer lab. There are five additional rooms available on the basement floor for offices, storage, a small production setup area, along with a test facility with a garage entrance and access to a 1-ton overhead crane.\n\n\n"}

From 2005 until his appointment to a political post, Brovtsev was head of the board of directors of Russian construction company Vermikulit based in the city of Chelyabinsk.\n\nOf Russian ethnicity, he was born in Chelyabinsk-65 (now Ozyorsk) in 1969.\n\nDespite having no previous connection to South Ossetia, Brovtsev became Prime Minister of S.Ossetia after his predecessor, Aslanbek Bulatsev, was fired, according to the official decree, on health reasons, on 4 August 2009. 24 out of 27 MPs voted in favour of Brovtsev as the new PM. There were no other candidates.\n\nIn April 2010, Brovtsev came under heavy criticism from various sides. It was claimed that he did not manage Russia's monetary aid to rebuild destroyed South Ossetian buildings very well. Several members of the South Ossetian parliament called for Brovtsev to resign, and brought a motion of no confidence to the parliamentary debating floor, which was discussed on 5 May. On 5 May, president Eduard Kokoity appeared before parliament, reiterating his support for Brovtsev. Parliament still passed a motion, creating a commission to review the government's activities. The commission is to be led by deputy chairman of parliament and former Prime Minister Zurab Kokoyev, and among its other members is also former Prime Minister Merab Chigoev.\n\nMeanwhile, Brovtsev has hit back by pointing at recent polls taken by the International Center of Political Analysis (MTsPA), which show an approval rating for Kokoity of 12.4%, with 66.3% of respondents having a negative opinion. Brovtsev, on the other hand is credited 37.8% positive and 10.9% negative. Kokoity's advisor Kosta Dzugaev called the poll \"lies\", stating that the MTsPA had never done any actual research in South Ossetia. The MTsPA has been linked to the website rsoinform.com, a news agency reporting favorably about Brovtsev, which at first sight appears to be an official government information service. South Ossetian government press agency OSinform states, however, that it is not official and not registered in South Ossetia. It is speculated that Brovtsev himself is linked to these institutions.\n\nIn an effort to defend himself against media attacks, Brovtsev has sued several media. Apparently the lawsuit at first included OSInform, leading to a somewhat embarrassing situation for Brovtsev, who did not know OSInform is the South Ossetian state information agency.\n\nBrovtsev is married and has two children.\n\nSource: \n"}
