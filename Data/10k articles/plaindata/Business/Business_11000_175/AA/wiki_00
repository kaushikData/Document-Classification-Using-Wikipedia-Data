The seam is made by mechanically overlapping the two layers to form a hook.\n\nDifferent parameters of the hook are measured and monitored to check the integrity of the seam under different conditions.\n\nThe shape of the double seam is determined by the shape of the seamer roll profile and the relative position.

Initially, the first operation roll folds the lid (end) and then the second operation rolls tightens the resulting seam.\n\nThe first operation seam is critical to avoid problems like wrinkles (tightness issues) and leaks. The shape of the seam is determined by the shape of the first operation roll, the second operation roll, their relative positions and distances, lifter height, lifter pressure.

The first project of CECOSESOLA was a funeral home. It is now the largest in the region. The Institute operates its own coffin production.\n\nAbout fifty-based organizations with a total of 20,000 members (employees and users) are connected to the network. 1,200 Cooperative fashionistas work as \"full-time\" (trabajadores asociados) at CECOSESOLA. They get their livelihood directly from the total composite. They pay a weekly amount which is mentioned in the definition of wage labor \"advance\" (anticipo). The height is about twice the government-set minimum wage. This advance is based on people's requirements, so it is not the same for everyone. Those with children, for example, get more. In 2010, the turnover of the company amounted to 430 million Bolivares - around 100 million U.S. dollars.\n\n\nIn the six projects of 190,000 health care treatments are performed per year. In 2009, the newly built health center was inaugurated in CICS. Here, alternative treatments such as acupuncture and massages are offered, but also surgical procedures and laboratory and X-ray examinations. The prices are 60 percent below those of private hospitals. For members of the cooperatives certain treatments are free.\n\nThe cooperative also includes farms: Twelve organizations in the states of Lara and Trujillo with over 200 small farms (2-3 hectares) supply the markets. In some, companies will try to replace agrochemicals with biological crop protection. Small production cooperatives produce foods that are sold in the markets - bread, whole grain pasta, cereals, tomato sauce, herbs, spices, honey, fruit pulp etc. There is also a credit union and other financing and a Solidarity Fund.\n\nThere is a high turnout of customers whose needs are not always discussed with them outside. Some of the customers are also involved in the cooperatives.\n\nInside the most striking feature is the absence of hierarchical positions. \"All members can always get involved at all levels with the same rights. Decisions in consensus and met again for discussion, if someone declares his non-acceptance in hindsight, was independent of whether the person involved in the decision or absent. In 2011, there were about 3,000 of the weekly meetings in individual and cooperative projects instead, and 300 cross-meetings.\"\n\nThere is no governing body, no managing director and no supervision. You trying to make sure that the meetings are not a substitute for, the management or the manager. Each person or group to take responsibility for decisions that must be made in everyday life. consensus means for the members otherwise than unanimity. For the unanimity all members of a group or organization must be present. This corresponds to a vote in which all are in favor. A consensus decision is when they 'corresponds to, We, that is the criteria that you share in this moment -. Whether this decision was made by a person, a group or an informal gathering this kind, to make decisions, can obviously lead to chaos and missteps that may attract large economic losses. But all economic losses are by far compensated by the flexibility and dynamism that results in the organization, in that we free ourselves from the cultural shackles that restrict all our capacities and creative potential.\"\n\nCECOSESOLA trying to take the place of power and enforcement of personal interests in an opposite process. Dismantle hierarchies, making information accessible to all, build trust relationships and to establish its own identity on the collective power of solidarity. The experience of CECOSESOLA can explain different concepts:\n\nHere, the forms that people interact with each other like here in relationship, beyond the sphere of work and production. Perhaps it is here rather a different way of life that needs no justification for efficiency criteria. \"When we succeed, the self-organization of living with respect for others and the Other, we will do by and by this momentum to our own, and our behavior will be consistent with the process of life. This opens us the possibility to go beyond the dutiful ecological behavior that will get only from a utilitarian nature, which is at the service of man.

He was a partner and then consultant with Simpson Grierson in Wellington. Also prominent businessman with many governance positions, Beyer was a securities commissioner on the Securities Commission of New Zealand from 2001 until 2010. He was the stepfather of former Member of Parliament Georgina Beyer.\n\nOf Danish descent, Beyer was born in Wellington on 10 September 1938 to Knud Johan Nielsen and Carla Emilie (n√©e Pallesen) Beyer. His father worked on the wharves in Wellington and his mother worked for the Education Department. Together with his younger brother Trevor and his sister Olga, they lived in Island Bay. Both brothers attended Wellington College.\n\nBeyer was educated at Victoria University of Wellington. He graduated with an LLB and was admitted to the bar in 1962. His specialities are corporate law and mining law. He was a partner with Simpson Grierson for ten years until 2003, when he became a consultant (the term that Simpson Grierson uses for former partners). As of December 2010, Beyer is no longer listed on the Simpson Grierson website as a consultant.\n\nBeyer was a prominent businessman with considerable governance experience. He was made a Distinguished Fellow of the Institute of Directors in 2006. He served as Chairman of the Accident Compensation Corporation, Government Property Services Ltd., Capital Properties New Zealand Ltd, Tower Ltd and Summit Resources Ltd, and a director of Capital Power Ltd and TrustPower Ltd. He was a ministerial appointee on the Wellington Area Health Board and the Wellington Polytechnic Board.\n\nHe was chairman of the Tower Corporation from 1990 until his resignation in 2003. The sacking of managing director James Boonzaier in 2002 under his chairmanship caused some controversy. Beyer was widely criticised in financial circles for publicly blaming Boonzaier for Tower's poor financial performance, and Beyer's decision not to stand for re-election prior to the 2003 AGM is described as having prevented the \"possibility of a humiliating defeat\". Bruce Sheppard, the founder of the New Zealand Shareholder's Association, criticised the board of Tower under Beyer's chairmanship over the setting of directors' fees and the payment of retirement allowances. Sheppard described the practices of the board as \"the most outrageous gaming by the most reprehensible group\".\n\nBeyer was appointed to the Securities Commission in February 2001 for a four-year term. In early 2005, he was reappointed for a second five-year term by Commerce Minister Pete Hodgson. In 2009, Minister of Commerce Simon Power announced that Beyer would retire in February 2010, to be succeeded by Simon Botherway.\n\nHe was the Honorary Consul-General of Finland from 1993, and was by 2006 the Dean of the Consular Corps in Wellington. He was made a Commander of the Order of the Lion of Finland.\n\nIn the 1970s, while living in Camborne, he spent some time on the Porirua City Council, first as an independent and later as a Labour Party representative. During his time as a Porirua city councillor Beyer was widely respected for his sound judgement and a broad knowledge and understanding of the complex range of issues the City was dealing with. He later moved to Kelburn.\n\nBeyer was married to Noeline Bertrand (n√©e Tamati). Her first child, born 1957 as George Bertrand and later named Georgina Beyer, came to live with them after their marriage after having spent the previous years with her parents. Their son Andrew was born in December 1963. With marital problems developing, George was sent to Wellesley College boarding school, where he tried to commit suicide for feeling rejected by his parents. Colin Beyer separated from Noeline in 1971 and moved to Brooklyn, where he shared an apartment with Ron Brierley, whom he knew from Wellington College. He married Brazilian-born Anna and had two sons. He also gained custody of his son Andrew.\n\nGeorgina Beyer came out first to her stepfather, before telling her mother about her 1984 sex reassignment surgery. She achieved fame as the world's first transsexual Member of Parliament.\n\nColin Beyer died on 21 August 2015. His funeral was held at Old St. Paul's, Mulgrave St, Wellington.\n\n"}
{"id": "32896707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32896707", "title": "Corporate law in Vietnam", "text": "Corporate law in Vietnam\n\nCorporate law in Vietnam was originally based on the French commercial law system. However, since Vietnam's independence in 1945, it has largely been influenced by the ruling Communist Party. Currently, the main sources of Corporate Law are the Law on Enterprises, the Law on Securities and the Law on Investment.\n\nCorporate law in Vietnam is largely influenced by French laws due to its colonial past. After the 1954 Geneva Conference, Vietnam separated into two zones: the North and the South. In 1980, after the North took control of the South, the country adopted a centrally-planned economy, with officials discouraging private commerce.\nIn 1986, the government initiated economic reforms (Doi Moi) to the corporate sector to reinvigorate the ailing economy. These policies aimed to reverse most of policies that led to economic crises in the 1970s and 1980s following the Vietnam War. Development of the private sector was encouraged and the economy was liberalized in hopes of increasing the potential for economic development. In 1987, the Law on Foreign Investment was passed, allowing foreign investors into the country.\n\nIn 1990, the Law on Private Enterprises and Companies Law were introduced to boost economic development. They were subsequently superseded by the Law on Enterprises (LOE) in 1999, which introduced Partnerships in addition to Limited Liability Companies and Shareholding Companies. Within three years of implementing the LOE, over 70,000 enterprises were registered as compared to just over 40,000 for the previous nine years. Law on Investment (replacing Law on Foreign Investment) and a new LOE were enacted in 2005. These statutes are expected to further strengthen Vietnam's economy and its potential for international economic integration.\n\nThe Constitution - Mainly seen as the ultimate Party policy documents.\n\nLegislation - Originated from civil law passed down from the French.\n\nThe LOE governs business enterprises in Vietnam. Enterprises in all economic sectors have to satisfy the stipulated conditions accounted for in Article 7(2).\nThere are 4 forms of business enterprises.\n\nAn LLC is established by members' capital contribution to the company. As a LLC is a legal entity separate from the owners, the owner(s)'s liability for the firm's debts and obligations is limited to his capital contribution.\n\nLLCs exist in two forms - one-member LLC, or multi-member LLC. The former is owned by an organisation/individual, while the latter allows for two to fifty members.\n\nThe management structure consists of a Members' Council (MC), Chairperson of the MC and Director. Where there are more than 11 members in LLC, an Inspection Committee (IC) must also be established.\n\nAn SC is an entity with at least three shareholders, where ownership of the firm depends on the number of shares they hold. It is the only form of enterprise that can issue securities to raise capital.\n\nShareholders' liability is limited to their capital contribution; however, shareholders can be personally liable where the company is substantially undercapitalised on formation.\n\nThe management structure consists of a shareholders' meeting (SM), a board of management (BOM), a director and an IC.\n\nA partnership comprises at least two co-owners jointly conducting business under one common name, with at least one co-owner being an individual. In a partnership, there can be both limited and unlimited liability partners.\n\nThe Partners' Council, consisting of all partners, is the highest body in the partnership with the right to resolve all business affairs, such as the admission of new partners.\n\nA private enterprise is a firm owned by an individual, who is its legal representative The owner has total discretion in making business decisions, and is liable for its operations to the extent of all his assets. Each individual can only establish one private enterprise.\n\nThe government has rules to restrict certain lines of businesses, and will periodically review business conditions and proceed with any changes accordingly.\n\nThe rights and obligations of business enterprises are provided for in Articles 8‚Äì10; but might differ slightly should the enterprise offer public services or products.\nOwners in LLCs have to contribute capital in full and on time. In one-member LLCs, the owner will be responsible for debts and other property obligations if he fails to do so. Meanwhile, in multi-member LLCs, members are to contribute capital in the type of asset, and any change is subject to the consent of other members.\n\nOwners in LLCs can assign a share of their capital contribution except where prohibited. In one-member LLCs, this is the only way for the owner to withdraw capital.\n\nThe government provides specific provisions on the forms of offering securities to the public. In offering securities, SCs are subject to conditions laid out in the Securities Law, such as the requirement for a paid-up charter capital at the time of offering of at least VND 10 billion in book value.\n\nFounding shareholders can assign their registered ordinary shares to each other if they hold 20% of ordinary shares for 3 years from the date of the Business Registration Certificate. Approval at the SM will allow a non-founding shareholder to purchase registered ordinary shares from a founding shareholder.\n\nIf an unlimited-liability partner fails to contribute capital accordingly, other partners may be held liable to compensate the partnership for the damage. However, where the limited liability partner fails to contribute capital accordingly, the unpaid amount will become a debt owed by that partner to the partnership.\n\nAn unlimited liability partner can transfer his share of capital in the partnership to another person only with the consent of the other unlimited liability partners.\n\nThe owner must register his investment capital in the firm, and record changes in the investment capital in the accounts.\n\nThe ownership powers of the enterprises are vested in the MC/Chairman for LLCs and in the SM and BOM for SCs. They are the highest decision making bodies for each enterprise and are tasked with the passing of resolutions, amending the Company Charter and setting out the general direction of the Company, etc. A resolution can only be passed with a minimum percentage approval. Such a rule is put in place to ensure the interests of all shareholders are protected.\n\nThe Director, appointed by the ownership institutions of the enterprise, has Executive powers and oversees the day-to-day running of the Company for SCs and LLCs. He is legally responsible for the implementation of delegated rights and obligations. Directors of LLCs cannot be affiliated to any member of the MC, ensuring the separation of powers between the company's ownership and management.\n\nHowever, for SCs, the LOE permits persons to take up dual roles as Director and chairman of the BOM. One survey found that 75% of chairmen of a BOM were also the Directors of their company. Furthermore, other members of the BOM are often majority shareholders and managers of the company. This highlights an indefinite differentiation between ownership and management.\n\nThe LOE prescribes the formation of a mandatory IC to monitor and check the ownership and executive powers. Members of the IC must minimally possess professional qualifications or accounting/auditing work experience, and cannot be related to members of the ownership or executive bodies. This ensures impartiality and prevents conflict of interests. However, in SCs, while members of the IC cannot hold any managerial positions in the company, they are allowed to own company shares or be a general employee of the Company.\n\nWhere the MC/Chairman of the LLC fails to convene a requested meeting within 15 days of the request, he must bear personal liability for any damage that may result to the company.\n\nThe LOE prescribes that the Director of a LLC may be sued by shareholders should he fail to perform his obligations and duties. In contrast, in a SC, there are no such provisions to grant the shareholders power to bring an action against Directors who do not perform their duties. While the law lays out the fiduciary duties of the Directors, it does not provide a way to enforce these duties. This has led to the criticism that the interests of shareholders of SCs are not adequately protected.\n\nThe IC is legally responsible for the implementation of its rights and duties. The LOE however does not specify the circumstances under which the IC will be deemed to have neglected its rights and duties and hence be legally liable.\n\nThe LOE prescribes certain regulations to control and approve large related-party transactions. For SCs, if a loan agreement/contract is valued at at least 50% of the company's total assets, it is subject to approval by the BOM.\n\nAll related-party transactions must be approved by the shareholders. 'Related-party' include managers of the enterprise or family members of shareholders, and related-party transactions are business arrangements between two parties with prior relationships.\n\nManagement personnel have to disclose details of their and their related parties' ownership interests in other enterprises; the latter applies where the related-party holds more than 35% of charter capital. These measures ensure that personal interests do not override the company's interests. In addition, shareholders or directors related to the transaction cannot vote on the deal.\n\nThe LOE, however, does not provide for an external checking mechanism for related-party transactions. The BOM has the sole and unfettered right to give approval to related-party transactions, and this lack of an extra checking mechanism has resulted in a lack of investor protection in Vietnam.\n\nBoth foreign and domestic investments are similarly treated under the LOI. Foreign investors and expatriates working for foreign-invested businesses or business co-operation contract can remit investment capital, profits and other assets, and their income abroad respectively.\nThere are four types of foreign investment in Vietnam:\n\nForeign investors may establish economic organizations or LLCs in the form of 100% capital of foreign investors.\n\nForeign investors may enter a joint venture where there is at least one foreign and one domestic investor. The operational duration of a Foreign Invested Project cannot exceed 50 years; where the Government thinks it necessary to continue, it cannot exceed 70 years. FOEs are recommended over joint ventures and they can be formed quickly through application of investment licenses. Joint ventures face problems such as corruption and the lack of control over the business.\n\nForeign investors may invest in contractual agreements with Vietnamese partners to cooperate on specific business activities. This form of investment does not constitute a new legal entity and the investors have unlimited liability for BCC's debts.\n\nA foreign investor can sign such a contract with a State body to implement projects for expansion and modernization of infrastructure projects in the sectors stipulated by the Government.\n\nAlthough Vietnam's corporate law adopted Anglo-American legal principles, common law jurisdictions like the US grant businesses greater flexibility in choosing corporate governance structures. The LOE, however, imposes mandatory internal governance structures. This has been criticised for failing to give companies the latitude to adapt their corporate governance structures to suit their needs.\nAnglo-American law allows directors to delegate their powers to a sub-committee or another person. Meanwhile, in Vietnam, subcommittees can be established to assist the BOM, but the latter cannot delegate its powers to the former. The imposition of mandatory corporate governance structures without delegation of powers leads to less flexibility and efficiency.\n\nInternal governance structures are important in supervising the company managers. In US, the supervisory body is often subsumed within the single-tiered board of directors, whereas in Vietnam, the IC is an independent body. Through separation of supervisory and management functions, the Vietnamese corporate law model, at least theoretically, ensures that the BOM is held to a greater degree of accountability by an independent checking mechanism.\nHowever, there is no hierarchy for the Vietnamese IC and BOM. This contrasts with the German two-tiered board model for SCs, with an Aufsichtsrat (supervisory board) which is hierarchically superior to the Vorstand (management board). Because the IC is not recognised as a superior institution, it has limited authority over the BOM. In practice, many supervisors are low level employees within the company. Although institutionally independent, the members of the IC are, in reality, dependent on their employers for their livelihoods, and therefore serve as a weak check against mismanagement by the BOM or Director.\n\nIn Vietnam, executive powers are vested solely in the Director while in Germany, executive powers are shared equally amongst members of the Vorstand. This encourages consensus decision-making in German companies as responsibility is shared amongst all members of the Vorstand. This can be further contrasted with Japan, where the corporate law does not designate any positions for corporate officers (the Vietnamese equivalent of Director) and executive powers are largely retained within the Board of Directors (the Vietnamese equivalent of BOM).\n\nCorporate governance in Vietnam is seen more as a management framework rather than a system for accountability and protecting minority shareholders. In particular, the LOE does not clearly mandate the separation of ownership and management. Separation of ownership and management promotes accountability by allowing managers to be objectively appraised. On the other hand, owners who serve as managers will be more likely to pursue their own interests, possibly at the expense of the interests of minority shareholders.\n\nFollowing the introduction of LOE, SOEs were converted to single-organisation-owned LLCs. However, the state retains many powers and is directly involved in management decision-making. Government officials are thus selected to run companies for political reasons. Their lack of business expertise and profit motive has led to inefficiency and mismanagement of large state-owned enterprises.\nFurthermore, since only up to three supervisors can be appointed, there is limited monitoring on the company managers. In 2010, the state-owned shipbuilding firm Vinashin ended in bankruptcy, following mismanagement and false reporting of financial statements. This reflects the inadequate monitoring and auditing mechanisms for SOEs.\n\nThe LOE is increasingly recognizing the interests of minority shareholders by introducing new avenues for them to hold the management accountable. Nonetheless, with stringent prerequisites including higher shareholding requirements and the need to show evidence before minority shareholders can call for a shareholders' meeting, investor protection in Vietnam is still limited compared to other jurisdictions.\nOther shortcomings of the LOE include limited opportunities for shareholders to request a meeting, no imposition of legal responsibilities on board members who approve unfair transactions, no shareholders' rights to sue those in the corporate governance structure (for SCs), and a shortage of provisions to require disclosure obligations and directors to avoid insolvent trading.\nPhuoc & Partners is Vietnamese law firm, Vietnamese attorney, Vietnamese solicitor, Vietnam company law\n"}

Ex-Workers Collective\" or \"CrimethInc Ex-Workers Ex-Collective\", is a decentralized anarcho-communist collective of autonomous cells. CrimethInc. emerged in the mid-1990s, initially as the hardcore zine \"Inside Front\", and began operating as a collective in 1996. It has since published widely read articles and zines for the anarcho-communist movement and distributed posters and books of its own publication.\n\nCrimethInc. cells have published books, released records, and organized national campaigns against globalization and representative democracy in favor of radical community organizing. Less public splinter groups have carried out direct action (including arson and hacktivism), hosted international conventions and other events, maintained local chapters, sparked riots, and toured with multimedia performance art or hardcore anarcho-punk musical ensembles. The collective has received national media and academic attention, as well as criticism and praise from other anarchists for its activities and philosophy. CrimethInc. has an association with the North American anarcho-punk scene due to its relationship with artists in the genre and its publishing of \"Inside Front\" as well as, more recently, the contemporary anti-capitalist movement.\n\nActivities by CrimethInc. cells have toured with hardcore anarcho-punk musical ensembles. In 2002, a cell in Olympia, Washington staged a five-day film festival with skill-sharing workshops and screenings. Cells have also supported various large-scale campaigns with publicity work, including the \"Unabomber for President\" and the \"Don't Just (Not) Vote\" election campaigns as well as the protests against the Free Trade Area of the Americas of 2003 in Miami, Florida. Individuals adopting the CrimethInc. \"nom de guerre\" have included convicted ELF arsonists, as well as hacktivists who successfully attacked the websites of DARE, Republican National Committee and sites related to U.S. President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. These activities have earned the collective irregular attention from the mainstream news media. In 2010, several CrimethInc. cells worked in collaboration with other anti-capitalists and anarchists to launch international Steal Something From Work Day, which coincides with the United States Tax Day.\n\nThe creation of propaganda has been described as the collective's core function. Among their best-known publications are the books \"Days of War, Nights of Love\", \"Expect Resistance\", \"Evasion\", \"Recipes for Disaster: An Anarchist Cookbook\" the pamphlets \"To Change Everything: an Anarchist Appeal\" (available in paper, PDF and video form) and \"Fighting For Our Lives\" (of which, to date, they claim to have printed 600,000 copies), the hardcore punk/political zine \"Inside Front\", and the music of hardcore punk bands. Several websites are maintained by individual cells, including Crimethinc.com, operated by the Far East Cell, which hosts propaganda, excerpts from available publications, and a blog of the activities of other cells. CrimethInc. is connected to publishing collectives/organizations with similar ideas, notably the Curious George Brigade, which has written a number of publications including \"Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs\". In 2005, they began publishing a half-gloss journal, \"Rolling Thunder\", with the byline \"An Anarchist Journal of Dangerous Living\", which released its eighth issue in 2009. CrimethInc. texts have received wide coverage in the anarchist media and in academic publications, and have been used as reading materials for university courses on anarchism.\n\nSince the summer of 2002, CrimethInc. has hosted annual conventions, termed \"convergences\", open to anyone. Typically featuring the performances of traveling theatrical troupes, musicians, direct-action and mutual-aid workshops from individual participants, the few-days-long camping trips have attracted coverage in newspaper articles, initiated multiple Reclaim the Streets actions, mobilized large Critical Mass events, and catalyzed many other activities.\n\nThe 2007 convergence in Athens, Ohio, saw an impromptu street party which resulted in arrests on minor charges. \"The Athens News\" characterized the convergence as \"a sort of networking, resume-swapping opportunity for would-be radicals, free-thinkers, Levellers, Diggers, Neo-Luddites and other assorted malcontents.\" It is typical of these gatherings to require that all attendees have something to contribute to the momentum: whether it is bringing food or equipment to share, leading a discussion group, or providing materials with which to write to political prisoners. There has been a pattern of promoting convergences as festivals, reminiscent of barnstorming flying circuses and travelling sideshows.\n\n\"Harper's\" journalist Matthew Power described the 2006 convergence in Winona, Minnesota as follows:\nThese convergences have been hosted by different groups within the collective each time, typically based on the initiative of local enthusiasts. Every year a different set of policy requests is released from locals in the field, typically encouraging a sober, consensus-based space in which no financial transactions are made. The one firm rule has been \"No police informants,\" a regulation which has been ignored by the FBI. Information gathered by FBI informants at CrimethInc. convergences (in 2004, 2005, and 2008) contributed to the convictions of Eric McDavid and his associates, as well as 2008 Republican National Convention protester Matthew DePalma.\n\nIn 2010, CrimethInc. announced the \"We Are Everywhere\" campaign of national tours and events in lieu of the traditional convergence. In 2015, CrimethInc. embarked on the similar \"To Change Everything\" two-month tour of the United States.\n\nCrimethInc. is associated with the North American anarcho-punk scene because of its long relationship with notable musicians in the genre and its publishing of \"Inside Front\", a \"journal of hardcore punk and anarchist action\". CrimethInc. releases include LPs, CDs, and 7\"s from North American and European anarcho-punk, hardcore and anti-folk bands. Academic Stacy Thompson has described CrimethInc. as \"exemplary of a more contemporary and nuanced approach\" to the possible forms anarcho-punk could take to resist commodification through aesthetic expression. However, Thompson does not consider the aesthetic choices of the collective to be substantially different from the anarcho- and crust punk bands released by fellow anarcho-punk collective \"Profane Existence\" in the mid-to-late 90s.\n\nCrimethInc as a loose association represents a variety of political views; the CrimethInc. FAQ asserts that it has \"no platform or ideology except that which could be generalized from the similarities between the beliefs and goals of the individuals who choose to be involved‚Äîand that is constantly in flux.\" \"CrimethInc.\" is an anonymous tag, a means of constructing dynamic networks of support and communication within the anarchist movement, and as such anyone can publish under the name or create a poster using the logo; each agent or group of agents operate autonomously. As well as the traditional anarchist opposition to the state and capitalism, agents have, at times, advocated a straight edge lifestyle, the total supersession of gender roles, violent insurrection against the state, and the refusal of work.\n\nCrimethInc. is influenced by the Situationist International, and has been described by scholar Martin Puchner as \"inheritors of the political avant-garde\", Ken Knabb has criticized CrimethInc. for presenting simplistic and in some cases false accounts of history in their manifesto \"Days of War, Nights of Love\", and for mythologizing themselves as \"a pole of international subversion\". For their part, the authors of the book criticized the \"exclusive, anti-subjective\" nature of history as \"paralyzing\", advocating in its place a non-superstitious myth. The collective has expressed a strident anti-copyright stance and advocacy of the appropriation of texts and ideas of others, which has attracted criticism from academic philosopher George MacDonald Ross as an endorsement of plagiarism. CrimethInc.'s N¬©! free license is known as an example of copyleft. It grants rights to individuals and none to corporations.\n\nThe active participants of CrimethInc. characterize it as a mindset and a way of life first and foremost, rather than as an organization \"per se\". Its main goal is to inspire people to take more active control of their own lives, becoming producers of culture and history instead of passive consumers. Those who ascribe to the CrimethInc. philosophy advocate radical ways of living one's life to the end of eliminating the perceived inequities and tyrannies within society. Contributors to publications are generally not credited in respect of an anonymity asserted by participants to be one of the organization's primary values. The name \"CrimethInc.\" itself is a satirical self-criticism about the hypocrisy of revolutionary propaganda (and other \"margin-walking between contradictions\") and a direct reference to the concept of \"thoughtcrime\" developed in George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6057975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6057975", "title": "Depletion (accounting)", "text": "Depletion (accounting)\n\nDepletion is an accounting and tax concept used most often in mining, timber, petroleum, or other similar industries. The depletion deduction allows an owner or operator to account for the reduction of a product's reserves. Depletion is similar to depreciation in that it is a cost recovery system for accounting and tax reporting. \n\nDepletion, for both accounting purposes and United States tax purposes, is a method of recording the gradual expense or use of natural resources over time. Depletion is the using up of natural resources by mining, quarrying, drilling, or felling.\n\nAccording to the IRS Newswire, over 50 percent of oil and gas extraction businesses use cost depletion to figure their depletion deduction. Mineral property includes oil and gas wells, mines, and other natural deposits (including geothermal deposits). For that purpose, property is each separate interest businesses own in each mineral deposit in each separate tract or parcel of land. Businesses can treat two or more separate interests as one property or as separate properties.\n\nFor tax purposes, the two types of depletion are percentage depletion and cost depletion.\nFor mineral property, one generally must use the method that gives you the larger deduction. For standing timber, one must use cost depletion.\n\nTo figure percentage depletion, one multiplies a certain percentage, specified for each mineral, by gross income from the property during the tax year. The rates to be used and other conditions and qualifications for oil and gas wells are discussed below under \"Independent Producers and Royalty Owners\" and under \"Natural Gas Wells\". Rates and other rules for percentage depletion of other specific minerals are found later in \"Mines and Geothermal Deposits\".\n\nCost depletion is an accounting method by which costs of natural resources are allocated to depletion over the period that make up the life of the asset. Cost depletion is computed by estimating the total quantity of mineral or other resources acquired and assigning a proportionate amount of the total resource cost to the quantity extracted in the period. For example, if Big Texas Oil, Co. discovers a large reserve of oil, the company has estimated the oil well will produce 200,000 barrels of oil. The company invests $100,000 to extract the oil and extracts 10,000 barrels the first year. Therefore, the depletion deduction is $5,000 ($100,000 X 10,000/200,000).\n\nCost depletion for tax purposes may be completely different from cost depletion for accounting purposes:\n\nAdjusted basis is the basis at end of year adjusted for prior years depletion in cost or percentage. It automatically allows for adjustments to the basis during the taxable year.\n\nBy using the units remaining at the end of the year, the adjustment automatically allows for revised estimates of the reserves.\n\nDepletion is based upon sales and not production. Units are considered sold in the year the proceeds are taxable under the taxpayer's accounting method.\n\nReserves generally include proven developed reserves and \"probable\" or \"prospective\" reserves if there is reasonable evidence to have believed that such quantities existed at that time.\n\nIf producer X has capitalized costs on property A of $40,000, originally consisting of the lease bonus, capitalized exploration costs, and some capitalized carrying costs, and the lease has been producing for several years and during this time, X has claimed $10,000 of allowable depletion. In 2009, X's share of production sold was 40,000 barrels and an engineer's report indicated that 160,000 barrels could be recovered after December 31, 2009.\n\nThe calculation of cost depletion for this lease would be as follows:\n\n\n"}

For employees, it can result from both poor performance at work or from misconduct. For students, it results from misconduct alone, with poor academic performance instead resulting in scholastic probation.\n\nFor a student, disciplinary probation means that the student is on formal notice, and subject to special rules and regulations. The violation of these rules may lead to more severe forms of discipline, such as suspension, dismissal, and expulsion.\n\nFor employees, disciplinary probation is one common step in a scheme of progressive discipline. It is a common replacement, in non-unionized workplaces, for the progressive disciplinary step of suspension without pay. A usual period for such probation is 90 days.\nSome companies may place permanent employees on probationary status, particularly if their performance is below a set standard or for disciplinary reasons. In this instance, the employee is usually given a period of time to either improve their performance or modify their behaviour before more severe measures are taken. \n\n\n"}

MacMillan in 1995 and subsequently referenced in a number of books and articles. Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach applies than is normally used in conventional planning. In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project, as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery-driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success. Conventional project management tools, such as stage-gate models or the use of financial tools to assess innovation, have been found to be flawed in that they are not well suited for the uncertainty of innovation-oriented projects \n\nDiscovery-driven planning has been widely used in entrepreneurship curricula and has recently been cited by Steve Blank as a foundational idea in the lean startup methodology \n\nA discovery-driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements:\n\nUsing discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered \"real\" options. A real option is a small investment made today which buys the right, but not the obligation to make further investments.\n\n\n"}

He remained at IBM for more than 20 years.\n\nAt IBM, he was promoted to his first management position in 1996 as the Director of Personal Systems Group for Western Europe.\n\nOver the following decade, Cerutti ascended the ranks of IBM, and worked in roles that were particularly international. In 1998, he became Executive Assistant to the Chairman and CEO, Lou Gerstner.\n\nIn 2000, he moved to IBM Global Services, the leading market services provider in Europe, first as General Manager for Western Europe and then for the whole EMEA region. He managed tens of thousands of employees in 17 different sectors. In 2005, Cerutti became IBM‚Äôs General Manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa.\n\nAccording to his former IBM colleagues, Cerutti starkly contrasted with the company‚Äôs generally diffident management style, and preferred to clearly outline strategies for his teams.\n\nIn 2009 Dominique Cerutti left IBM to join NYSE Euronext, the global exchange group, as President and Deputy CEO. He was also CEO of Euronext NV, the European subsidiary of NYSE Euronext, and Chairman and CEO of Euronext Paris. In 2010, he was appointed as Board Member of the Group. He undertook one of his first notable projects as a member of the Board: compliance with the EU‚Äôs Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. According to him, this directive decreased transparency in financial markets by allowing the creation of alternative exchange platforms at a time when ‚Äúthe need for transparence has never been so acute.‚Äù \n\nIn November 2013, he moved up from Deputy CEO of NYSE to become the CEO of Euronext.\n\nIn June 2014, he oversaw Euronext‚Äôs IPO as an independent company after it separated from parent company ICE. As CEO of Euronext, he turned around the strategy of the group, moving away from the legacy of his predecessor, Jean-Fran√ßois Th√©odore. In September 2014, he embarked on a program to increase operational savings by ‚Ç¨60 million over the next three years, with the goal of achieving a 5% annual revenue growth and improve the company's long-term EBITDA margin from 42% to 53%.\n\nCerutti has also spoken against the European Commission's proposal of a financial transactions tax, arguing that \"the political intention of creating such a tax is a noble one, but the current form of the proposal is counter-productive [‚Ä¶] this tax is truly the last thing we need now.‚Äú He has also spoken out in favor of increased market regulation and transparency as the main way of reducing risk.\n\nDuring his time as CEO, Euronext once again became independent and had an IPO in its own markets.

This is the extraction of human-usable strategies from these oracles. Current pattern recognition approaches do not seem to fully acquire the high level of abstraction required to be applied successfully. Instead, extensive experimentation with the tablebases ‚Äì combined with an intensive study of tablebase-answers to well designed problems, and with knowledge of prior art (i.e., pre-tablebase knowledge) ‚Äì is used to yield insightful patterns. Berlekamp (in dots-and-boxes, etc.) and John Nunn (in chess endgames) are notable examples of researchers doing this work, though they were not ‚Äì and are not ‚Äì involved in tablebase generation.\n\nIn business, data mining is the analysis of historical business activities, stored as static data in data warehouse databases. The goal is to reveal hidden patterns and trends. Data mining software uses advanced pattern recognition algorithms to sift through large amounts of data to assist in discovering previously unknown strategic business information. Examples of what businesses use data mining for is to include performing market analysis to identify new product bundles, finding the root cause of manufacturing problems, to prevent customer attrition and acquire new customers, cross-selling to existing customers, and profiling customers with more accuracy.\n\nIn recent years, data mining has been used widely in the areas of science and engineering, such as bioinformatics, genetics, medicine, education and electrical power engineering.\n\nData mining of government records ‚Äì particularly records of the justice system (i.e., courts, prisons) ‚Äì enables the discovery of systemic human rights violations in connection to generation and publication of invalid or fraudulent legal records by various government agencies.\n\nSome machine learning algorithms can be applied in medical field as second-opinion diagnostic tools and as tools for the knowledge extraction phase in the process of knowledge discovery in databases.\nOne of these classifiers (called \"Prototype exemplar learning classifier\" (PEL-C) is able to discover syndromes as well as atypical clinical cases.\n\nIn 2011, the case of Sorrell v.

S√∏ren Brunak notes that ‚Äúthe patient record becomes as information-rich as possible‚Äù and thereby ‚Äúmaximizes the data mining opportunities.‚Äù Hence, electronic patient records further expands the possibilities regarding medical data mining thereby opening the door to a vast source of medical data analysis.\n\nSpatial data mining is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. The end objective of spatial data mining is to find patterns in data with respect to geography. So far, data mining and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have existed as two separate technologies, each with its own methods, traditions, and approaches to visualization and data analysis. Particularly, most contemporary GIS have only very basic spatial analysis functionality. The immense explosion in geographically referenced data occasioned by developments in IT, digital mapping, remote sensing, and the global diffusion of GIS emphasizes the importance of developing data-driven inductive approaches to geographical analysis and modeling.\n\nData mining offers great potential benefits for GIS-based applied decision-making. Recently, the task of integrating these two technologies has become of critical importance, especially as various public and private sector organizations possessing huge databases with thematic and geographically referenced data begin to realize the huge potential of the information contained therein. Among those organizations are:\n\nChallenges in Spatial mining:\nGeospatial data repositories tend to be very large. Moreover, existing GIS datasets are often splintered into feature and attribute components that are conventionally archived in hybrid data management systems. Algorithmic requirements differ substantially for relational (attribute) data management and for topological (feature) data management. Related to this is the range and diversity of geographic data formats, which present unique challenges. The digital geographic data revolution is creating new types of data formats beyond the traditional \"vector\" and \"raster\" formats. Geographic data repositories increasingly include ill-structured data, such as imagery and geo-referenced multi-media.\n\nThere are several critical research challenges in geographic knowledge discovery and data mining. Miller and Han offer the following list of emerging research topics in the field:\n\nData may contain attributes generated and recorded at different times. In this case finding meaningful relationships in the data may require considering the temporal order of the attributes. A temporal relationship may indicate a causal relationship, or simply an association.\n\nWireless sensor networks can be used for facilitating the collection of data for spatial data mining for a variety of applications such as air pollution monitoring. A characteristic of such networks is that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values. This kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires the techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining. By measuring the spatial correlation between data sampled by different sensors, a wide class of specialized algorithms can be developed to develop more efficient spatial data mining algorithms.\n\nIn the process of turning from analog into digital, large data sets have been generated, collected, and stored discovering statistical patterns, trends and information which is hidden in data, in order to build predictive patterns. Studies suggest visual data mining is faster and much more intuitive than is traditional data mining. See also Computer vision.\n\nData mining techniques, and in particular co-occurrence analysis, has been used to discover relevant similarities among music corpora (radio lists, CD databases) for purposes including classifying music into genres in a more objective manner.\n\nData mining has been used by the U.S. government. Programs include the Total Information Awareness (TIA) program, Secure Flight (formerly known as Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II)), Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight, Semantic Enhancement (ADVISE), and the Multi-state Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX). These programs have been discontinued due to controversy over whether they violate the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution, although many programs that were formed under them continue to be funded by different organizations or under different names.\n\nIn the context of combating terrorism, two particularly plausible methods of data mining are \"pattern mining\" and \"subject-based data mining\".\n\n\"Pattern mining\" is a data mining method that involves finding existing patterns in data. In this context \"patterns\" often means association rules. The original motivation for searching association rules came from the desire to analyze supermarket transaction data, that is, to examine customer behavior in terms of the purchased products. For example, an association rule \"beer ‚áí potato chips (80%)\" states that four out of five customers that bought beer also bought potato chips.\n\nIn the context of pattern mining as a tool to identify terrorist activity, the National Research Council provides the following definition: \"Pattern-based data mining looks for patterns (including anomalous data patterns) that might be associated with terrorist activity¬†‚Äî these patterns might be regarded as small signals in a large ocean of noise.\" Pattern Mining includes new areas such a Music Information Retrieval (MIR) where patterns seen both in the temporal and non temporal domains are imported to classical knowledge discovery search methods.\n\n\"Subject-based data mining\" is a data mining method involving the search for associations between individuals in data. In the context of combating terrorism, the National Research Council provides the following definition: \"Subject-based data mining uses an initiating individual or other datum that is considered, based on other information, to be of high interest, and the goal is to determine what other persons or financial transactions or movements, etc., are related to that initiating datum.\"\n\nKnowledge discovery \"On the Grid\" generally refers to conducting knowledge discovery in an open environment using grid computing concepts, allowing users to integrate data from various online data sources, as well make use of remote resources, for executing their data mining tasks. The earliest example was the Discovery Net, developed at Imperial College London, which won the \"Most Innovative Data-Intensive Application Award\" at the ACM SC02 (Supercomputing 2002) conference and exhibition, based on a demonstration of a fully interactive distributed knowledge discovery application for a bioinformatics application. Other examples include work conducted by researchers at the University of Calabria, who developed a Knowledge Grid architecture for distributed knowledge discovery, based on grid computing.\n"}

Foreign exchange risk also exists when the foreign subsidiary of a firm maintains financial statements in a currency other than the reporting currency of the consolidated entity. The risk is that there may be an adverse movement in the exchange rate of the denomination currency in relation to the base currency before the date when the transaction is completed. Investors and businesses exporting or importing goods and services or making foreign investments have an exchange rate risk which can have severe financial consequences; but steps can be taken to manage (i.e. reduce) the risk.\n\nTypes of Foreign exchange risk \n\nA firm has \"transaction risk\" whenever it has contractual cash flows (receivables and payables) whose values are subject to unanticipated changes in exchange rates due to a contract being denominated in a foreign currency. To realize the domestic value of its foreign-denominated cash flows, the firm must exchange foreign currency for domestic currency. As firms negotiate contracts with set prices and delivery dates in the face of a volatile foreign exchange market with exchange rates constantly fluctuating, the firms face a risk of changes in the exchange rate between the foreign and domestic currency. It refers to the risk associated with the change in the exchange rate between the time an enterprise initiates a transaction and settles it.\n\nApplying public accounting rules causes firms with transnational risks to be impacted by a process known as \"re-measurement\". The current value of contractual cash flows are remeasured at each balance sheet.\n\nA firm has \"economic risk\" (also known as \"forecast risk\") to the degree that its market value is influenced by unexpected exchange rate fluctuations. Such exchange rate adjustments can severely affect the firm's market share position with regards to its competitors, the firm's future cash flows, and ultimately the firm's value. Economic risk can affect the present value of future cash flows. Any transaction that exposes the firm to foreign exchange risk also exposes the firm economically, but economic risks can be caused by other business activities and investments which may not be mere international transactions, such as future cash flows from fixed assets. A shift in exchange rates that influences the demand for a good in some country would also be an economic risk for a firm that sells that good.\n\nA firm's \"translation risk\" is the extent to which its financial reporting is affected by exchange rate movements. As all firms generally must prepare consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes, the consolidation process for multinationals entails translating foreign assets and liabilities or the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries from foreign to domestic currency. While translation risk may not affect a firm's cash flows, it could have a significant impact on a firm's reported earnings and therefore its stock price.\n\nA firm has \"contingent risk\" when bidding for foreign projects or negotiating other contracts or foreign direct investments. Such a risk arises from the potential of a firm to suddenly face a transnational or economic foreign exchange risk, contingent on the outcome of some contract or negotiation. For example, a firm could be waiting for a project bid to be accepted by a foreign business or government that if accepted would result in an immediate receivable. While waiting, the firm faces a contingent risk from the uncertainty as to whether or not that receivable will happen.\n\nIf foreign exchanges market are efficient such that purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, and the international Fisher effect hold true, a firm or investor needn't protect against foreign exchange risk due to an indifference toward international investment decisions. A deviation from one or more of the three international parity conditions generally needs to occur for an exposure to foreign exchange risk.\n\nFinancial risk is most commonly measured in terms of the variance or standard deviation of a variable such as percentage returns or rates of change. In foreign exchange, a relevant factor would be the rate of change of the spot exchange rate between currencies. Variance represents exchange rate risk by the spread of exchange rates, whereas standard deviation represents exchange rate risk by the amount exchange rates deviate, on average, from the mean exchange rate in a probability distribution. A higher standard deviation would signal a greater currency risk. Economists have criticized the accuracy of standard deviation as a risk indicator for its uniform treatment of deviations, be they positive or negative, and for automatically squaring deviation values. Alternatives such as average absolute deviation and semivariance have been advanced for measuring financial risk.\n\nPractitioners have advanced and regulators have accepted a financial risk management technique called value at risk (VaR), which examines the tail end of a distribution of returns for changes in exchange rates to highlight the outcomes with the worst returns. Banks in Europe have been authorized by the Bank for International Settlements to employ VaR models of their own design in establishing capital requirements for given levels of market risk. Using the VaR model helps risk managers determine the amount that could be lost on an investment portfolio over a certain period of time with a given probability of changes in exchange rate\n\nFirms with exposure to foreign exchange risk may use a number of foreign exchange hedging strategies to reduce the exchange rate risk. Transaction exposure can be reduced either with the use of the money markets, foreign exchange derivatives such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options, and swaps, or with operational techniques such as currency invoicing, leading and lagging of receipts and payments, and exposure netting.\n\nFirms may adopt alternative strategies to financial hedging for managing their economic or operating exposure, by carefully selecting production sites with a mind for lowering costs, using a policy of flexible sourcing in its supply chain management, diversifying its export market across a greater number of countries, or by implementing strong research and development activities and differentiating its products in pursuit of greater inelasticity and less foreign exchange risk exposure.\n\nTranslation exposure is largely dependent on the accounting standards of the home country and the translation methods required by those standards. For example, the United States Federal Accounting Standards Board specifies when and where to use certain methods such as the temporal method and current rate method. Firms can manage translation exposure by performing a balance sheet hedge. Since translation exposure arises from discrepancies between net assets and net liabilities on a balance sheet solely from exchange rate differences. Following this logic, a firm could acquire an appropriate amount of exposed assets or liabilities to balance any outstanding discrepancy. Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge against translation exposure.\n\nMany businesses were unconcerned with and did not manage foreign exchange risk under the Bretton Woods system of international monetary order. It wasn't until the switch to floating exchange rates following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system that firms became exposed to an increasing risk from exchange rate fluctuations and began trading an increasing volume of financial derivatives in an effort to hedge their exposure. The currency crises of the 1990s and early 2000s, such as the Mexican peso crisis, Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the Argentine peso crisis, led to substantial losses from foreign exchange and led firms to pay closer attention to their foreign exchange risk.\n\n"}

The first work Lyons published was the 1896 textbook entitled \"A treatise on business practice,\" which was designed as textbook for all business schools and as reference for all classes.\n\nLyons had started his commercial textbook business in cooperation with Orville Marcellus Powers (1852-1910s) under the name Powers & Lyons in the 1890s. One of the first books were \"The new business arithmetic; a treatise on commercial Calculations,\" first published in 1893, and \"The complete accountant: Designed for the use of schools and private study : a book of reference for the counting house, embodying the latest forms and methods in use in the best business houses,\" first published in 1898. Both books were authored by Powers, and ran in several editions.\n\nThe firm Powers & Lyons had been dissolved in 1909, and Lyons assumes full ownership, continuing the business under the name of J. A. Lyons & Company. In 1911 James W. Carnahan joined the firm, who had been general representative of the Ginn & Company publishing company. The publishing company changed its name in Lyons and Carnahan. Based in Chicago, the company continued to concentrated on publishing textbooks.\n\nThe purpose of the 1908 \"Modern corporation accounting,\" was to show students what a corporation is, and how it is created; to give them in concise form a correct idea of those accounts which belong peculiarly to corporation bookkeeping, and the original entries which affect those accounts; and to illustrate several processes of closing the ledger of a corporation and distributing corporation profits. While studying these things, observing students will learn much that will be of general benefit and that will serve to guide them in possible future dealings with corporations.\n\nIn \"Modern corporation accounting,\" (1908) Lyons picture some of the transactions and entries which are peculiar to corporations and corporation accounting. In doing so, he presents one of the earliest modern flow diagrams of cost accounting. These relation was originally pictured by Emile Garcke and J. M. Fells in their System of factory accounting from 1889. Lyons had symplified these relations into one single flow diagram:\n\nLyon explained that the above diagram shows the relation of the various loss or gain accounts to each other, and indicates what account each group of accounts closes into. Out-Freight, Cash Discount Dr., and the Sales Book total, close into the Sales account. Manufacturing Labor, Manufacturing Expense, Materials, and Materials Expense close into Production (after In-Freight and Cash Discount Cr., which are subordinate to Materials, have been closed into Materials). Sales and Production, which now exhibit respectively the net returns on merchandise and the gross cost of manufacture, are closed into Implements, which is the Merchandise account.\n\nIn the exercise section of the book four other examples where pictured of Loss & Gain accounts for a construction company, a railroad company, a gas production company, and a plow company, see images above.\n\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from: Lyons, James A., \"Modern corporation accounting (voucher system), 1908; and some other PD sources listed.\n"}

Traditionally mass marketing has focused on radio, television and newspapers as the media used to reach this broad audience. By reaching the largest audience possible, exposure to the product is maximized, and in theory this would directly correlate with a larger number of sales or buys into the product.\n\nMass marketing is the opposite of niche marketing, as it focuses on high sales and low prices and aims to provide products and services that will appeal to the whole market. Niche marketing targets a very specific segment of market; for example, specialized services or goods with few or no competitors.\n\nMass marketing or undifferentiated marketing has its origins in the 1920s with the inception of mass radio use. This gave corporations an opportunity to appeal to a wide variety of potential customers. Due to this, variety marketing had to be changed in order to persuade a wide audience with different needs into buying the same thing. It has developed over the years into a worldwide multi-billion dollar industry. Although sagging in the Great Depression it regained popularity and continued to expand through the 40s and 50s. It slowed during the anti-capitalist movements of the 60's and 70's before coming back stronger than before in the 80's, 90's and today. These trends are due to corresponding upswings in mass media, the parent of mass marketing. For most of the twentieth century, major consumer-products companies held fast to mass marketing- mass-producing, mass distributing and mass promoting about the same product in about the same way to all consumers. Mass marketing creates the largest potential market, which leads to lowered costs.\nIt is also called overall marketing.\n\nOver the years marketing activities have notably transitioned from traditional forms, such as television, radio and print advertisements to a more digitalized forms, such as the utilisation of online media platforms to reach various consumers. Huang (2009, as cited in Shyu et al., 2015), explains three chief attributes digital marketing has enhanced; one being ‚ÄúPenetrating Power‚Äù which is to have the ability to reach a wider circle of customers in the market, accredited to the ease of online communication. Digital marketing allows for a marketer to reach a larger-scale audience in a more efficient and cost-effective manner, which is ultimately what Mass Marketing seeks to do.\n\nFor a mass marketing campaign to be successful, the advertisement must appeal to a ‚Äúset of product needs that are common to most consumers in a target market.‚Äù (Bennett & Strydom, 2001) In this case it is unnecessary to segment consumers into separate niches as, in theory, the product should appeal to any customer‚Äôs wants and/or needs. Many mass marketing campaigns have been successful through persuading audiences using the central route to persuasion, as well as using the peripheral route to persuasion, according to the Elaboration Likelihood Model. Lane et al. state that the different types of persuasion depend on the ‚Äúinvolvement, issue-relevant thinking, or elaboration that a person dedicates to a persuasive message.‚Äù (2013). Political campaigns are a prime example of central persuasion through mass marketing; where the content of the communication involves a detailed level of thinking which seeks to achieve a cognitive response. Contrastingly, a toothpaste advertisement would typically persuade the audience peripherally; where there is low involvement and consumers rely on ‚Äúheuristics‚Äù to alter their behaviour. John Watson was a leading psychologist in mass marketing with his experiments in advertising.\n\nThe shotgun theory is an approach of mass marketing. It involves reaching as many people as possible through television, cable and radio. On the Web, it refers to a lot of advertising done through banners to text ads in as many websites as possible, in order to get enough eyeballs that will hopefully turn into sales. An example of shotgun marketing would be to simply place an ad on primetime television, without focusing on any specific group of audience. A shotgun approach increases the odds of hitting a target when it is more difficult to focus on one.\n\nA potential limitation of using the shotgun approach is that each receiver will interpret the message in their own way, whether this be the way the sender intends for it to be decoded, or not. In other words, the receiver‚Äôs ‚Äúframe of reference‚Äù at the time of decoding enables them to perceive a brand message in a particular way; thus, the marketer‚Äôs intention may be become distorted. Dahlen, Lange, & Smith (2010) claim that each receiver has different ‚Äúattitudes, values and perceptions stemming from knowledge, experience or the influence of other people.‚Äù In situations where there is no specific target market, mass marketers should simply focus on grabbing the attention of consumers in ‚Äúdifferent, surprising, original and entertaining‚Äù ways in order to generate the most desirable feedback. (Bigat, 2012).\n\nGuerrilla marketing aims to cut through clutter by attracting attention in unique, memorable and imaginative ways to ‚Äúmaximise interest in a firm‚Äôs goods and services while minimizing the costs of advertising.‚Äù (Bigat, 2012). According to Kotler (2007, as cited in Bigat, 2012) this type of marketing was traditionally carried out by small to medium sized enterprises but has become more predominant in today‚Äôs society where competition is substantially thicker. It is particularly effective at reaching a large-scale audience due to the captivating nature of the advertisement.\n\nBigat discusses the role of technology, more specifically, of the internet and its effectiveness of disseminating a large message from the sender to receivers; to which he states that ‚ÄúInternet blogs, online magazines, newspapers along with chat and forum pages are crucial arenas for getting the message across.‚Äù Logically, this is due to the fact that digitalised media generates more efficient feedback from consumers. Mass marketers should aim to effect the behaviour of their consumers by having them engage with the brand in a positive way, which, in turn tends to more activity (both on and offline) as well as further market penetration.\n\nMass marketing is used to effect attitude change to as wide an audience as possible. Often this would take the form of selling a product like toothpaste. Toothpaste isn't made specially for one consumer and it is sold in huge quantities. A company or individual who manufactures toothpaste wishes to get more people to buy their particular brand over another. The goal is when a consumer has the option to select a tube of toothpaste that the consumer would remember the product which was marketed. Mass marketing is the opposite of niche marketing, where a product is made specially for one person or a group of persons. Other products of mass marketing are furniture, artwork, automobiles, residential communities, fizzy drinks and personal computers. Typically, things which are perceived to be necessary/essential to the consumer are subject to mass marketing. Resources of mass marketing provide cost-effective marketing solutions for small and micro businesses, including start-ups. Even \"products\" like politicians and services from professions such as law, chiropractic and medicine, are subject to mass marketing.\n\nTo further increase profits, mass marketed products touted as \"durable goods\" are often made of substandard material, so that they deteriorate prematurely. This practice is called planned obsolescence. Not only does this lower production costs, but it ensures future sales opportunities by preventing the market from becoming saturated with high-quality, long-lasting goods. The forces of a free market tend to preclude the sale of substandard staples, while disposability, technological innovations, and a culture of collection all facilitate planned obsolescence.\n\nMany mass marketed items are considered staples. These are items people are accustomed to buying new when their old ones wear out (or are used up). Cheaper versions of durable goods are often marketed as staples with the understanding that they will wear out sooner than more expensive goods, but they are so cheap that the cost of regular replacement is easily affordable.\n\nSince the target audience is broad, the number of successful hits is high despite the low probability of a single person turning up, and if all the efforts in one particular area goes in vain, the eventual loss is less compared to one in a narrowly focused area. Production costs per unit are low on account of having one production run for homogeneous product, and marketing research/advertising costs are also relatively low as well, which, as a whole, leads to higher potentials of sales volume and efficiency of scale in a much larger market.\n\nDue to increased competition and the complexity of consumers‚Äô wants and needs in today‚Äôs society, Bennett and Strydom (2001) suggest that mass marketing campaigns are less likely to be successful; as consumers have a range of specific tastes and requirements that they would more likely find in alternative products.\n\n"}

{"id": "7535533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7535533", "title": "Microtargeting", "text": "Microtargeting\n\nMicrotargeting, often used by political parties and election campaigns includes direct marketing datamining techniques that involve predictive market segmentation (aka cluster analysis). It is used by the United States Republican and the Democratic political parties, as well as candidates to track individual voters and identify potential supporters. The term \"microtargeting\" was coined in 2002 by political consultant Alexander P. Gage.\n\nThey use various means of communication such as direct mail, phone calls, home visits, television, radio, web advertising, email, and text messaging, among others,to communicate with voters, crafting messages to build support for fundraising, campaign events, volunteering, and eventually to turn them out to the polls on the election day. Microtargeting's tactics rely on transmitting a tailored message to a subgroup of the electorate on the basis of unique information about that subgroup.\n\nAlthough some of the tactics of microtargeting had been used in California since 1992, it really started to be used nationally only in 2004. In that year, Karl Rove, along with Blaise Hazelwood at the Republican National Committee, used it to reach voters in 18 states that George W. Bush's reelection campaign was not able to reach by other means. The results were greater contacts with likely Bush voters. For example, in Iowa the campaign was able to reach 92% of eventual Bush voters (compared to 50% in 2000) and in Florida it was able to reach 84% (compared to 50% in 2000). Much of this pioneering work was done by Alex Gage and his firm, TargetPoint Consulting.\n\nDemocrats did limited microtargeting in 2004, with some crediting microtargeting for Kerry's win in Iowa in 2004. Some news accounts credited Republican superiority in that area for victories in that election cycle. Democrats later developed microtargeting capabilities for the 2006 election cycle. \"It's no secret that the other side [Republicans] figured this out a little sooner\", said Josh Syrjamaki, director of the Minnesota chapter of America Votes in October 2006. \"They've had four to six years' jump on us on this stuff...but we feel like we can start to catch up.\"\n\nIn the United States presidential election, 2016, Cambridge Analytica played a role in first promoting Ted Cruz and, eventually, Donald Trump. However, the claims of Cambridge Analytica's influence, made by its managers, have not been proven, and Cruz's opponent Ben Carson was ultimately unsuccessful even though he, too, involved Cambridge Analytica in his campaign.\n\nMicrotargeting is a modification of a practice used by commercial direct marketers. It would not be possible on a large scale without the development of large and sophisticated databases that contain data about as many voters as possible. The database essentially tracks voter habits in the same ways that companies like Visa track consumer spending habits. The Republican National Committee's database is called Voter Vault. The Democratic National Committee effort is called VoteBuilder. A parallel Democratic effort is being developed by Catalist, a $9 million initiative headed by Harold Ickes, while the leading non-partisan database is offered by Aristotle.\n\nThe databases contain specific information about a particular voter (party affiliation, frequency of voting, contributions, volunteerism, etc.) with other activities and habits available from commercial data brokers such as Acxiom, Dun & Bradstreet, Experian Americas, and InfoUSA. Such personal information is a \"product\" sold to interested companies. These data are particularly illuminating when portrayed through a geographic information system (GIS), where trends based on location can be mapped alongside dozens or hundreds of other variables. This geographic depiction also makes it ideal for volunteers to visit potential voters (armed with lists in hand, laid out in the shortest route‚Äîmuch like how FedEx and UPS pre-determine delivery routes).\n\nThese databases are then mined to identify issues important to each voter and whether that voter is more likely to identify with one party or another. Political information is obviously important here, but consumer preferences can play a role as well. Individual voters are then put into groups on the basis of sophisticated computer modeling. Such groups have names like \"Downscale Union Independents\", \"Tax and Terrorism Moderates,\" and \"Older Suburban Newshounds.\"\n\nOnce a multitude of voting groups is established according to these criteria and their minute political differences, then the tailored messages can be sent via the appropriate means. While political parties and candidates once prepared a single television advertisement for general broadcast nationwide, it is now not at all uncommon to have several dozen variations on the one message, each with a unique and tailored message for that small demographic sliver of the voting public. This is the same for radio advertisement, direct mail, email, as well as stump speeches and fundraising events.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10948234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10948234", "title": "Microthermoforming", "text": "Microthermoforming\n\nMicrothermoforming is the abbreviation for microscopic or microscale thermoforming, or, more precisely, for thermoforming of microproducts or microstructure products. Microstructure products means products that have structures in the micrometre range and have their technical function provided by the shape of the microstructure [1]. Thermoforming [2] in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of thermoplastic polymer films or plates with their edges fixed by three-dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the films or plates into female moulds (negative forming) or over male moulds (positive forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro injection moulding or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer.\n\nMoulds for polymer microreplication in general and in particular for microthermoforming can be fabricated by various methods such as mechanical micromachining, lithographic based methods in combination with electroplating (see also the so-called 'LIGA' process) and wet or dry etching. And they can be fabricated of various materials such as metal, silicon and glass.\n\nFor several years now, at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a pressure or high pressure (thermo)forming process is used to fabricate film microchips for capillary electrophoresis (CE) [3‚Äì5] and for three-dimensional cell cultivation [6‚Äì8]. The process is derived from the macroscopic trapped sheet forming process [2]. This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100¬†¬µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.\n\nFirst examples of processes coming near to something that could be called 'microthermoforming' originate from the second half of the nineties. So, in 1993, dome shaped polymer microstructures for use in electrical membrane switches were fabricated [9]. This was done between a mating upper and lower metal emboss die with a concave and a convex detail, respectively, first in a hot, then in a second cold press. And in 1999, corrugated sheet like polymer microstructures for use e.g. in electrostatic actuators were fabricated [10]. This was also done between heated tools and counter tools, namely in discontinuous processes between stamps or in continuous processes between rollers. Partly, the counter tool was a soft one in the form of a thicker, unpatterned film or plate made from an easily deformable, e.g. elastomeric material which is able to assume the shape of the hard, metallic tool. In 2006, at the School of Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering (PTFE) of the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT), the same technology approach was used to fabricate similar corrugated sheet like structures in a so-called 'rubber-assisted hot embossing process' [11].\n\nThe microthermoforming process including its products can have all the advantageous properties of the powerful macroscopic production process. Moreover, the thermoformed microparts have additional, specific properties appearing only in microscale dimensions and resulting from their unusual morphology. Thermoformed e.g. microfluidic structures have free standing microcavities such as channels and reservoirs and they are thin walled partly in the range of a few micrometers. Specific properties of thermoformed microparts are, amongst others, their high flexibility, their small volume and mass, their low thermal resistance and heat capacity, and their low light absorbance and background fluorescence. Morphology and properties of these microparts now can result in improved or even new, so far unthought of applications.\n\nCompared to the other microreplication processes, in microthermoforming, modifications of the film to be formed remain preserved beyond the forming step due to the already mentioned material coherence during this secondary forming process. This enables surface and bulk modification and functionalisation of the three-dimensionally formed films or membranes, namely as highly resolved micro- and nanopatterns, and all side, i.e. on hardly accessible side walls and even behind undercuts. Thus, e.g. thermoformed chips for three-dimensional cell cultivation can be provided with pores, cell adhesion patterns [6‚Äì8], surface topologies and electrodes [12].\n\nFuture application fields for microthermoforming are expected to be\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44112331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44112331", "title": "Mobile location analytics", "text": "Mobile location analytics\n\nMobile location analytics (MLA) refers to technology for retailers, including developing aggregate reports used to reduce waiting times at checkouts, improving store layouts, and understanding consumer shopping patterns. The reports are generated by recognizing the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth addresses of cell phones as they interact with store networks.\n\nBy seeing the movement of devices, retailers can gather data that will help them optimize such things as floor plan layouts, advertisement placement and checkout lane staffing. MLA products work by capturing a device's MAC address, the unique 12-digit number that is assigned to a specific hardware device. This number can be detected by WiFi or Bluetooth sensors. There are separate MAC addresses for WiFi and Bluetooth. \nBeacons are also used for MLA purposes and they work with Bluetooth. Through this technology, they are also able to send push notifications. Recently companies started using the combination of WiFi and Bluetooth to improve accuracy and reliability of the MLA devices. The technology works as people walk through stores; the tracking companies find their wireless signal and assign the device a random number. They monitor that number as it moves across the screen and analyze patterns in the data.\n\nA number of industries can benefit from MLA services including retail, real estate, energy, insurance, manufacturing, healthcare, government, planning, and public safety. For example, retail businesses can compare sales revenue and evaluate marketing campaign effectiveness. Businesses can determine where to open stores and distribute their products. MLA is also beneficial for emergency cases. Hospitals can determine demand for new vaccines or make sense of sudden disease outbreaks. This is possible because every information system, desktop solution, or mobile app can take advantage of the location.\n\nThe physical stores have tools to collect data on their shoppers by monitoring their movement and their pauses. Video monitoring can provide up to 10,000 data points per store visitor. This allows stores to develop heat maps so they can put the items they want to sell in high traffic areas.\nIf a mobile device is stolen by theft, this can be found by police by tracing the mobile number.\n\nIn-store analytics has become more like online store analytics. Stores can see where shoppers go and where they linger, detect whether they are shopping alone or with friends or children, and match shopping to weather. Mobile Location Analytics is helping stores in many ways. One company with small stores located in malls found that the space just inside the entry was a dead zone, so they moved the popular items further inside the store. Another store couldn‚Äôt tell which display sold more effectively because they had duplicate inventory. They were about to remove the wall displays when they decided to check traffic with a Mobile Location Analytics company. After creating a heat map, they made the floor displays smaller and easier for customers to walk through to reach the wall displays. The stores want analytics to see if the displays erected at the end of aisles eat away the sales of the same item stacked halfway down the aisle or if they contribute to additional sales.\n\nA mobile location analytics company can be used for counting, so they can ensure stores are staffed appropriately for the traffic at all times of the day. It helps businesses make better correlations between transaction data and traffic. So now they can find opportunities that they might be missing. According to a study, brick-and-mortar‚Äôs accounts for 93% of sales. Therefore, the retail store remains a critical focus.\nIt makes easier to find airport, bus stand etc.\n\nPrivacy is also a concern. The privacy agreement comes at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers are eager to have access to the kind of information about consumer behavior that can match Web retailers like Amazon. The move also reflects how industry is responding to public concern over the collection of personal data. As companies increasingly use data in more robust ways such as targeting online ads or tracking physical location, they are realizing the need to give users more control over how data is used.\n\nAlthough products dealing with mobile location analytics do not record personally identifiable information about specific customers, they have generated concerns about customer data integration and consumer privacy. Several MLA companies have worked with United States Senator, Charles Schemer and the Future of Privacy Forum to develop a smart phone tracking code of conduct. Under the voluntary code of conduct, MLA vendors and retailers will inform customers when they are being tracked and allow individual customers to opt out.\n\nNowadays most Wifi router or access points vendors provides an API for listening the device's MAC address of the signals to identify smartphones, this is the base of solution vendors of Wifi tracking and analytics systems, but almost new smartphones emit more than one MAC address when they are not connected to the WiFi. \nAn iPhone can produce a lot of different and/or false MAC addresses when visit a venue during 30-40 minutes, because every time you touch the screen and awake from sleep mode the MAC address changes.\n\nWifi tracking solution vendors are dealing with data based on these false MAC addresses if they try to detect not associated devices, and only if the smartphone connects to the WiFi access point to have free internet access (then it is associated) they can detected the true MAC address of the iPhone. But not so much people of total customers use the free internet service, in general less than 10-20%.\n\nThere is another technology for MLA is Seeketing\n\n. This technology based in specific radio sensors and SDKs provides solution for unique device identifier both online and offline, and can be integrated with other infrastructure: WEB sites, landing pages, WIFI,CRM, APPs, POS, Digital Screens and digital advertising networks, among others. \n\nSeeketing works listening 2,4 Ghz and 5 Ghz frequency bands (even they can work with other cellular bands) not only listening MAC addresses. It can recognize patterns of signals based in full signal parameters. Seeketing nodes can detect and identify approximately 70-80% of total smartphones in their coverage area (15.000 square meters) but reusing Wifi access points we can only ensure to detect and identify 10-20% (those who are connected to WiFi access point).\nAnd even it can we used to send messages to smartphones with APPs installed or without APP installed, similar to ibeacon interaction with Apps are possible, and similar to eddystone beacons interaction with Webs are possible with Seeketing technology.\n\n"}

He began his career in sales and became an innovator who offered finished clothing, which was unusual in an era when textiles were normally sold as unfinished cloth.\n\nCone manufactured unusual textile fabrics and founded a company that became a leading manufacturer of denim. His company was a major supplier to Levi Strauss and Company for nearly a century.\n\nMr. Cone and his wife had no children and donated substantial property upon their deaths. Their home Flat Top Manor has become a North Carolina tourist attraction that receives 250,000 visitors a year. It forms part of Moses H. Cone Memorial Park, which is run by the National Park Service. Their donations founded the Moses Cone Health System, a private not-for-profit health care system based in Greensboro, North Carolina and its principal facility The Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital.\n\nMoses Herman Cone was born in 1857 in Jonesborough, Tennessee. He was the eldest of thirteen children of Jewish-German immigrants. His parents, Herman Kahn and Helen Guggenheimer, emigrated from Germany to America in the 1840s. Moses' father changed his last name from Kahn to \"Cone\" almost immediately upon arrival in the United States to become more American.\n\nMoses' father Herman had a dry goods and grocery business in Jonesborough along with his brother-in-law Jacob Adler, the husband of his sister Sophia. While running the business Herman and Jacob would alternately make week-long peddling trips selling their wares. On one of these trips Herman met Helen Guggenheimer near Lynchburg, Virginia. They married in 1856 and Moses was born in 1857. Two years later came their next child named Ceaser with whom Moses enjoyed a close relationship all his life.\n\nThe family lived in Jonesborough until 1870 and had an additional five children there. Between 1857 and 1870 Moses' father became fairly well-to-do through his business affairs and real estate ventures. The family then moved to Baltimore, Maryland. There Moses' father and relatives started a wholesale grocery business called \"Guggenheimer, Cone, & Company, Wholesale Grocers\". Then in 1873 Jacob Adler also moved to Baltimore and went in partnership with Herman selling groceries. They formed a new firm that was called \"Cone & Adler\". They ran the business successfully and in 1878 dissolved it. This same year Moses' parents had their last child.\n\nMoses and Ceasar, now as young adults, immediately formed a new firm with their father. It was called \"H. Cone & Sons.\" Moses and his brother Ceasar were \"drummers\" (traveling salesmen) for their father's dry goods firm. They sold their wares from Maryland to Alabama.\n\nIn the 1880s the Cones then moved to Eutaw Place in Baltimore, on the same street as the Lindau family. In 1884, Moses began to court Bertha Lindau, the eldest daughter. Moses and Bertha in all likelihood met at a community social club called the \"Sociables.\" Moses' and Bertha's courtship would last four years, during which time Bertha was also wooed by others, including Moses' own brother Ceasar.\n\nMoses and Bertha were both from German Jewish descendants and had much in common. In addition, they both were firstborn children from large families. They married on February 15, 1888, and would have no children themselves.\n\nMoses and Ceasar dealt much with textile mill owners in their travels as salesmen. They not only sold normal dry goods, but introduced into their wares ready-made clothing as well as certain fabrics like denim. This gave them experience then in textile products and the textile industry. The Cone brothers soon invested in Southern textile mills which generally had over a 20% return on average. One of these companies the Cones invested into was \"C. E. Graham Manufacturing Company\" of Asheville, North Carolina, an up-and-coming newly formed textile mill. Moses became its president in 1882. The company's original builder Charles Edward Graham continued with its on-site management while Moses pursued other investments and ventures.\n\nIn 1880 Moses moved to Greensboro, North Carolina. Soon thereafter he joined Simon Lowman and Charles Burger to form \"Cone Brothers, Lowman, and Burger Clothing Manufacturers\" based in Baltimore. Moses discovered the need for durable clothing for the blue-collar people of the High Country and fulfilled this need with denim and plain, fabric-based clothing.\n\nIn 1890 Moses and Ceasar were contemplating even grander ventures and formed the \"Cone Export & Commission Company\" in New York City along with Anderson Price and Jay C. Guggenheimer as the other major stockholders. They developed what was called the \"Plaid Trust\" which was a commission clearing house to stabilize the production market on checks and plaids. They were a marketer of Southern cloth mill-goods to South America in competition with Great Britain. Initially the par value of the capital stock of their new company was fifty dollars per share. There were 20,000 shares of the company, so the value of this new firm was placed at one million dollars. Eventually they took in another forty mills over time to capture control of this market, but their ambitious goal was never fully achieved.\n\nIn 1895 Moses purchased a defunct steel mill and developed it into a large cotton mill called Proximity that produced blue and brown denim. He built additional mills throughout the Greensboro area and the deep South and soon became one of the biggest producers of the denim fabric in the world., becoming known as \"The Denim King\" in the late nineteenth century. At the turn of the twentieth century he began supplying denim to Levi Strauss and Company, a relationship that the Greensboro firm retains to this day.\n\nCone Mills Corporation was the world leader in the manufacturing of denim and largest supplier in the world. Moses was instrumental in the development of Watauga Academy, now known as Appalachian State University. In 1899, Moses donated $500 to the founders; it was the largest single donation received for the school's construction.\n\nMoses died at age 51 in 1908 of pulmonary edema at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The grave of Moses Cone is on the Cone Estate property approximately a mile by trail from the manor.\n\nHis childless wife Bertha lived an additional 39 years and donated the Flat Top Mansion property to the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital.\nA few years later the hospital conveyed the property to the National Park System with the proviso that it be known as the Moses H. Cone Memorial Park.\n\nThe Cone sisters, Claribel and Etta, were two of Moses' younger sisters. They befriended Picasso and Matisse while living amongst the School of Paris in its prime in Europe. The Cone Collection is one of the greatest in the world for these artists.\n\n\n"}

As befits its name there are some suggestions that the road is of ancient origin. It lies on the route of an old Roman or possibly pre-Roman track connecting Silchester and Colchester, skirting round the walls of Londinium, today the areas known as the City of London. \n\nThe western part was widened between 1872 and 1877, but it narrows east of Coronet Street; there survive, at Nos. 340-342 on the south side of the street and Nos. 323 and 325-329 on the north side, some domestic buildings from the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, though somewhat battered and altered in function. At the east end of Old Street there is a notable deviation of the line of the street as it joins the old Roman Road north to York. This deviation is visible on old maps but unexplained, and is today fronted by Shoreditch Town Hall and the former Shoreditch Magistrates Court (now a hotel). Together with St Leonard's, Shoreditch at the east end of Old Street, this was the civic hub of the former Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch.\n\nThe eastern half of the road is on the London Inner Ring Road and forms part of the boundary of the London congestion charge zone. Old Street and the surrounding areas of Hoxton Square and Great Eastern Street host a thriving night life. The street and its adjacent areas have attracted IT and tech companies, both established and start-ups, and Old Street Roundabout, located at the junction with City Road, has been dubbed Silicon Roundabout. Old Street station is located under the roundabout. With the increase in passenger numbers using the station, in 2014 Transport for London announced that it was to offer pop-up retail space there as part of a drive to increase its revenue. \n\nWithin the past few years Old Street has become a favoured location for notable graffiti artists such as Banksy and Jef A√©rosol.

The snowflake schema is represented by centralized fact tables which are connected to multiple dimensions.. \"Snowflaking\" is a method of normalizing the dimension tables in a star schema. When it is completely normalized along all the dimension tables, the resultant structure resembles a snowflake with the fact table in the middle. The principle behind snowflaking is normalization of the dimension tables by removing low cardinality attributes and forming separate tables.\n\nThe snowflake schema is similar to the star schema. However, in the snowflake schema, dimensions are normalized into multiple related tables, whereas the star schema's dimensions are denormalized with each dimension represented by a single table. A complex snowflake shape emerges when the dimensions of a snowflake schema are elaborate, having multiple levels of relationships, and the child tables have multiple parent tables (\"forks in the road\").\n\nStar and snowflake schemas are most commonly found in dimensional data warehouses and data marts where speed of data retrieval is more important than the efficiency of data manipulations. As such, the tables in these schemas are not normalized much, and are frequently designed at a level of normalization short of third normal form.\n\nNormalization splits up data to avoid redundancy (duplication) by moving commonly repeating groups of data into new tables. Normalization therefore tends to increase the number of tables that need to be joined in order to perform a given query, but reduces the space required to hold the data and the number of places where it needs to be updated if the data changes.\n\nFrom a space storage point of view, dimensional tables are typically small compared to fact tables. This often negates the potential storage-space benefits of the star schema as compared to the snowflake schema. Example: One million sales transactions in 300 shops in 220 countries would result in 1,000,300 records in a star schema (1,000,000 records in the fact table and 300 records in the dimensional table where each country would be listed explicitly for each shop in that country). A more normalized snowflake schema with country keys referring to a country table would consist of the same 1,000,000 record fact table, a 300 record shop table with references to a country table with 220 records. In this case, the star schema, although further denormalized, would only reduce the number or records by a (negligible) factor of ~0.9998 (=[1,000,000+300] divided by [1,000,000+300+220])\n\nSome database developers compromise by creating an underlying snowflake schema with views built on top of it that perform many of the necessary joins to simulate a star schema. This provides the storage benefits achieved through the normalization of dimensions with the ease of querying that the star schema provides. The tradeoff is that requiring the server to perform the underlying joins automatically can result in a performance hit when querying as well as extra joins to tables that may not be necessary to fulfill certain queries.\n\nThe snowflake schema is in the same family as the star schema logical model. In fact, the star schema is considered a special case of the snowflake schema. The snowflake schema provides some advantages over the star schema in certain situations, including:\n\n\nThe primary disadvantage of the snowflake schema is that the additional levels of attribute normalization adds complexity to source query joins, when compared to the star schema.\n\nSnowflake schemas, in contrast to flat single table dimensions, have been heavily criticised. Their goal is assumed to be an efficient and compact storage of normalised data but this is at the significant cost of poor performance when browsing the joins required in this dimension. This disadvantage may have reduced in the years since it was first recognized, owing to better query performance within the browsing tools.\n\nWhen compared to a highly normalized transactional schema, the snowflake schema's denormalization removes the data integrity assurances provided by normalized schemas. Data loads into the snowflake schema must be highly controlled and managed to avoid update and insert anomalies.\n\nThe example schema shown to the right is a snowflaked version of the star schema example provided in the star schema article.\n\nThe following example query is the snowflake schema equivalent of the star schema example code which returns the total number of units sold by brand and by country for 1997. Notice that the snowflake schema query requires many more joins than the star schema version in order to fulfill even a simple query. The benefit of using the snowflake schema in this example is that the storage requirements are lower since the snowflake schema eliminates many duplicate values from the dimensions themselves.\n\n\n"}

He founded the company town of Spreckels, California, just south of the city of Salinas, California, in 1897, but his descendants began to relinquish control when they started selling homes in the community to the public c. 1925. In 1891, Henry O. Havemeyer, who controlled The American Sugar Refining Company (The Sugar Trust), bought half of the stock of the Western Sugar Company, thus giving his company control of the Hawaiian sugar and of the markets west of the Mississippi River. When it was completed in 1899, Spreckels' \"Factory 1\" was the largest sugar refinery in the United States and the third-largest in the world.

{"id": "47533003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47533003", "title": "Teleadministration", "text": "Teleadministration\n\nTeleadministration is based on the concept that documents in electronic format have legal value. Administrative informatics is not new, but for many years it was merely Information Technology applied to legal documents, that is, the reproduction of paper-based legal documents into electronic file systems. Instead, Teleadministration turns this approach into its head. It is based on research conducted in 1978, the year when, at a conference promoted by the Court of Cassation, launched the then-futuristic idea that an electronic document could have legal value. 1978 was also the year in which the first research on digital signatures (RSA) was published in the United States, yet it would take more than twenty-five years for jurists and mathematicians to start working together.\n\nFor many years, and even before 1978, IT helped Public Administration but kept a ‚Äúsafe distance‚Äù, assuming that the ‚Äòsacred nature‚Äô of the Law demanded the use of pen and paper. Information Technology merely managed and filed copies of legal documents: it was known as ‚Äúparallel IT‚Äù, since it was an accessory to the activity with formal value, the one based on pen and paper.\n\nThus, the logical, legal and material premise of Teleadministration is the conferment of legal value to IT documents.\n\nIn Italy, the linguistic expression teleamministrazione was first used in 1991 at the Roman ‚ÄòLa Sapienza‚Äô university, during a conference organised by the Court of Cassation, in which it was said that: ¬´the new system of administrative information technology is called ‚Äúteleadministration‚Äù because all the work of the Public Administration will be carried out through devices, that could also be computers, linked to the central server through a network.¬ª Teleadministration was indeed considered a type of teleworking.\n\nWith Teleadministration, amministrative procedures become electronic administrative procedures and, more specifically, those that are initiated by a party realize the electronic One Stop Shop.\n\nIn the decades from 1970 to 1990, the Court of Cassation was at the core of research on the relationship between IT and Law, organising international conferences every five years on the topic. The 1993 international conference featured the fundamentals of teleadministration, providing the details of the administrative systems behind the One Stop Shop concept:\nIt should be noted that the 5th fundamental mentions electronic rather than digital signatures. This is because, in the jurists‚Äô domain, digital signatures were not yet known. The generic reference to the electronic signature is however valid, and its general nature is actually suitable for the rules contained six years later in the Directive 1999/93/EC.\nAs we will see, the Directive refers in particular to all procedures initiated by private citizens, but the system remains valid for all procedures initiated by the administration offices as well.\n\nThe legally accepted form of acts and documents evolved according to the following stages:\nIn Italy, Phase 2 was launched by Art 15, para, 2, Law N. 59 of 15 March 1997, (the so-called ‚ÄòBassanini 1‚Äô law: it established the legal value of electronic documents, while regulations would establish the authentication criteria). The EC intervened later with its Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 December 1999 (Transposed by Law Decree N.10 of 23 January 2002), which imposes an obligation on Member States to give legal value to documents with digital signatures (not directly named as such, but all their features are described in the directive). It also establishes that electronic documents should not be rejected a priori, hence opening to a range of different solutions to establish the authorship of a document (the so-called ‚Äòweak signatures‚Äô).\n\nThe 1993 Directive was revoked and absorbed (for reasons of legal certainty and clarity) by Regulation 910/2014 of the European Parliament and Council of 23 July 2014 (also known as eIDAS regulation) in the OJEU 28 August 2014, which did not renege on the principle of also accepting the so-called ‚Äòweak signatures‚Äô.\nIn Italy, The move to Phase 3 was established by Art.40 of Legislative sl. Decree N.82 of 7 March 2007, Code of Digital Administration (CAD), entitled ‚ÄúCreation of electronic documents‚Äù, which states: ‚ÄúPublic Administrations make the original copy of their documents with electronic means, according to the provisions of the present Code and the technical specifications of Article 71‚Äù. Exceptions are extremely rare: Comma 3 states: by means of appropriate regulations‚Ä¶. , proposed by the delegated Ministers for Public Functions, Innovation and Technology and the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities, the categories of administrative documents that can be created on paper in original are identified, having regard to the special historical and archive value they will have by nature‚Äù (think, for example, of the resignation of a President of the Republic).\n\nUnfortunately, national administrations are ignoring this provision, and today it is only private companies that are no longer allowed paper-based communication with public administrations (Art. N. 5 bis of the CAD and D.P.C.M. 22 July 2011); compulsory electronic invoicing was added on 31 March 2015 by Law N. 44 of 24 December 2007, Art. N. 1, para 209-214 implemented by Ministerial Decree N.55 of 3 April 2013, further clarified by Ministerial circular N.1 of 9 March 2015.\nThe modernisation of procedures was also touched by Presidential Decree N. 447 of 20 October 1998 (creation of the One Stop Shop, but only for production activities, and paper based), while interest for a telematic procedure only began with Legislative Decree N. 82 of 7 March 2005, CAD, which is not as relevant in its first version but was later modified by several interventions, particularly Legislative Decree N. 335 of 10 December 2013.\n\nEuropean sources are also essential. The EC, and later the European Union, have undertaken a wide range of actions on e-government: one of the most important was the launch of the IDABC programme (and financing) for Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to public Administrations, Business and Citizens, via Decision 2004/387/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 21 April 2004. However, the ultimate acknowledgement of the principles of teleadministration, with the telematic One Stop Shop, is contained in the Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 12 December 2006, on the Internal market for services, which provides for Member States to set up an electronic One Stop Shop in the wide field of administrative procedures.\n\nThis article is not meant to argue the great effect that teleadministration has on the efficiency of administrative activity, as we assume that the reader is fully aware that, once paper based documents are abandoned, the real-time flow of documents greatly improves time management and responsibility of the single offices/ operators, while direct online access improves transparency. Rather, this paragraph wants to emphasize how teleadministration promotes maximum usage of the ‚Äústar procedure‚Äù, known and researched in Germany as ‚ÄúSternverfahren‚Äù. This procedure, an alternative to the sequential procedure, which has by nature longer head times, in the paper-based world would require making several copies of the administrative file (which can be extremely voluminous) for each office and each administration that needs to express an opinion or issue an authorisation. With the One Stop Shop, the administration initiating the process is charged with this task. Electronic files clearly provide evident benefits for these procedures, since all involved administrations can directly and simultaneously access the file, view the part they need to evaluate and add their opinion or authorisation directly, using a star-shaped scheme.\n\nAs a scientific proposition, teleadministration sketched the system of telematic administrative procedures well ahead of the law, and particularly the electronic One Stop Shop concept. Both concepts are based on the dematerialisation of documents and on telematic administrative work.\n\nThe concept of documents‚Äô dematerialisation, in existence since 1978 as a scientific notion, was first embraced in Italy (Law N. 59 of 15 March 1997, Art. 15, para 2) and later by the E.C. in Directive 1999/93/EC.\n\nOnce the principle that an electronic document can have legal value was accepted, it was possible to deal with its management within a telematic procedure.\nAs mentioned, configuring this procedure within the rules of teleadministration is today accepted in both European and Italian laws. European laws also provide quite a detailed description of the electronic One Stop Shop, with rules that fit nicely within the scientific rules of teleadministration; their main limitation is that they were specifically designed for the free circulation of services within Europe, and hence for the procedures these require. It is the above-mentioned 1996/123/EC Directive, whose Art.6 establishes the One Stop Shop and Art. 8 provides that it should be managed ‚Äúremotely and electronically‚Äù, leaving further details to the Commission. And indeed the Commission, with its Decision of 16 October 2009, provided a number of measures to facilitate the use of electronic procedures through the ‚ÄúOne Stop Shop‚Äù under Directive 2006/123/EC. These sources are clear and they apply to a wide-ranging sector: the problem is that any sector or procedure that is not related to the supply of services within the Union is not regulated, and Member States are therefore able to carry on with old-fashioned paper-based procedures.\n\nIn light of this limitation, a group of illustrious European Law academics, coordinated by Giovanni Duni, has drafted the most effective text for a Directive providing a universal system of telematic administrative procedure.\n\nItalian sources are based on the Code of Digital Administration, the above-mentioned Law Decree N.82 of 7 March 2005 in its current version, following several modifications, which (if correctly interpreted and implemented) should make it compulsory for all public administrations to use teleadministration, thus making the telematic administrative procedure the default procedural method. Art. 14, the key provision, establishes that the proceeding administration creates an electronic file, to which all involved administrations can and should have access, and feed it with the acts of their competence. Private citizens can also access it under Law 241/90\nThus the electronic file is the technical and organizational specification of the telematic administrative procedure, as it is clear that its creation is an operative stage of the procedure and not simply a new filing system for the archives.\n\nArt. 10 of the CAD appears at first to be at odds with this interpretation, since it establishes that the One Stop Shop for productive activities provides its services electronically but leaves doubts about the possibility that the back office activities could be still paper-based. However, if Art. 10 and Art. 41 are interpreted together, the only possible conclusion is that the former is a clarification of front office activities, but all the administrative activity is based on the general rule of electronic files, and therefore on the teleadministration and the One Stop Shop. \nCompared to European and Italian law, reality is somewhat behind. Eight years after Directive 1996/123/CE, there would be grounds for an infraction procedure against Italy. But since Italy enjoys the company of several other non-compliant Member States, they are all ‚Äòsafe‚Äô for the time being.\n\nThough the letter of the CAD may be not be respected, it seems very unlikely that this may determine the invalidity or nullity of the acts for violation of Art. 41(electronic file) or Art. 40 (statutory requirement of digital signature), because in front of a claim of this nature, the administrative judge would apply Artt. 21 septies and 21 octies of Law 241/90. The claimant should demonstrate that the use of the electronic format and electronic file would have led to a different outcome.\n\n1995 Utah Code, paras 46-3-101 to 46-3-504 (Enacted by Law 1995, Ch. 61).

{"id": "17832630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17832630", "title": "The Death of Contract", "text": "The Death of Contract\n\nThe Death of Contract is a book by American law professor Grant Gilmore, written in 1974, about the history and development of the common law of contracts. Gilmore's central thesis was that the Law of Contracts, at least as it existed in the 20th-century United States was largely artificial: it was the work of a handful of scholars and judges building a system, rather than a more organic, historically rooted development based on the evolution of case law. This book is required supplemental reading in the first year program at many U.S. law schools. A second edition was published in 1995, which was edited with a new introduction by Ronald K.L. Collins.\n\nGilmore begins the introduction forcefully, stating \"We are told that Contract, like God, is dead. And so it is.\" Gilmore then brings us through the life of Contract, from birth to death. He notes that courts had been deciding contract law for centuries before the theory of contracts was introduced by Christopher Columbus Langdell. This assertion, that Langdell \"invented\" the general theory of contracts is somewhat contested by contracts scholars, with Richard Austen-Baker, for example, pointing out the lack of any evidence of any theory of contract authored by Langdell, to prior work by English jurists such as Addison and Leake and to far more developed work by English scholars such as Sir William Anson and Sir Frederick Pollock, contemporary with Langdell.\n\nGilmore retains the central idea that the general law of contract is a residual category, that is, what is left after all the specialized bodies of law have been added up. The world of commercial law, and within it contract law, was largely the product of the Industrial Revolution. It was created quite rapidly, outlined in little more than a half-century. Initially, for legal greats like Justice Story, there was no separate theory of contracts. Rather, there were specialized bodies of law that had been developed to address the various needs of the Industrial Revolution. Gilmore alleges, that rather than contract coming first, and the various specialties being developed afterwards, it actually was the opposite, where contract enveloped pre-existing specialties, like negotiable instruments and sales.\n\nGilmore credits Langdell with the ‚Äúalmost inadvertent discovery‚Äù of contract law, as it was the subject of his very first casebook. The goal of Langdell‚Äôs casebook was to reduce the world of contracts to major underlying principles in a scientific fashion. The theory of contracts created by Langdell is furthered by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and Samuel Williston, which Gilmore calls the Holmes-Williston construct. The theory is described whereby, ‚Äúno one should be liable to anyone for anything.‚Äù, or at least liability shall be strictly limited. Damages in contract were distinguished from damages in tort, and punitive damages were not to be allowed. Furthermore, courts were to act as ‚Äúdetached umpires or referees‚Äù and only to see that the rules of the game were followed, but not to ‚Äúsee that justice or anything of that sort was done.‚Äù Gilmore further describes Holmes‚Äô view on objective interpretation of contract law, as laid out in \"The Common Law\". Thus, Gilmore states that the theory of contracts was not developed naturally from continual case law development, such as the decisions by Lord Mansfield, but rather it was an ‚Äúivory tower abstraction‚Äù that lived ‚Äúin the law schools, not the law courts.‚Äù Often the rules of contract were the result of a string of cases being pulled together, with little citation or presentation of the facts, and declared to be a rule in the works of Williston. The problem with contract theory was that ‚Äúbusinessman, adapting to changing circumstance, kept doing things differently. The general theory required that, always and everywhere, things remain as they have, in theory, always been.‚Äù He illustrates this argument by reference to English case law that had been elevated by the theorists to the status of \"rules\", in \"Stilk v Myrick\", \"Dickinson v Dodds\" and \"Foakes v Beer\", all as a way of ensuring that the doctrine of consideration would preclude the enforceability of a contract.\n\nDeveloping on the discussion of the first chapter, Gilmore begins by focusing on the change from a subjective approach to an objective approach in the theory of contracts. Contract law in the 19th century was experiencing a shift from a formalistic regime toward a more flexible paradigm that tended to uphold the validity of contracts. This was due in part to the Industrial Revolution and the need to facilitate commerce between parties. The requirement of ceremonial trappings such as seals and ribbons gave way to a more reality based emphasis on consideration as indicia of the parties' intent to contract.\n\nGilmore begins with an analysis of \"Raffles v Wichelhaus\", otherwise famously known as \"The Peerless\". He continues, noting examples of case objectification by Holmes in his book \"The Common Law\", and that if the ‚Äúmagician‚Äù can objectify that case, he could do so to anything. According to Holmes, \"Raffles\", is not decided on a failure of the meeting of the minds, but rather they objectively said two different things. This action was consistent with Holmes‚Äô desire to remove morality from the understanding of law. The importance in objectifying contract law is that it is far easier to litigate. For Holmes, no longer could one void a contract simply because they had made a mistake, the mistake would have to be objectively reasonable. Gilmore finishes the chapter by discussing the reception of the policy of absolute contractual liability in \"Paradine v Jane\" into the law of Massachusetts, and the Holmesian theorists disdain for the condoning of special damages in \"Hadley v Baxendale\".\n\nGilmore‚Äôs first point is that contract law was never as neat and tidy as the casebooks tried to make it appear. Cases were selected and reported in the texts as long as they fit the categories already created. The theory of contract as formulated by Holmes and Williston, was disassembled by Benjamin N. Cardozo and Arthur Linton Corbin. Cardozo did this through his judicial opinions, which gave power to the courts to create contracts wherever possible, adding contract terms if necessary, while Corbin did so in his treatise on Contracts (which Gilmore describes as the greatest law book ever written). Corbin‚Äôs work takes the opposite stance of Holmes, refuting the idea that contract law was external, rather focusing on the ‚Äúoperative facts‚Äù of the cases.\n\nCorbin worked with Williston on the Restatement of Contracts. As Gilmore states, ‚ÄúWilliston and Corbin held antithetical points of view on almost every conceivable point of law.‚Äù As such, Gilmore points out the contradictions with the Restatement itself, citing sec. 75 and sec. 90. While sec. 75 takes a purely Holmesian objective point of view, sec. 90 appears to go in the exact opposite direction, allowing for reasonable expectations. Gilmore points to the contradiction of sections as example of the ‚Äúunspoken cases‚Äù as mentioned earlier that didn‚Äôt fit the Holmesian model, being presented by Corbin in an un-ignorable fashion. Ultimately, the differing view points resulted in the Restatement coming out ‚Äúfudged or blurred, pointing equivocally in all directions at once. The Restatement, we might say, ended up uneasily between past and future, which is no doubt the best thing that could have been done.‚Äù\n\nHowever, Gilmore points out that the future wins out, and the Second Restatement moves towards the direction of sec. 90, ‚Äúthe unwanted stepchild‚Äù of the first Restatement. The move is exemplified by the newfound success of plaintiffs looking to recover for the benefit that they conferred on the defendant, even though they ultimately failed to complete their contractual obligations.\n\nGilmore suggests that the theory of contract law just complicates the obvious. As he states, ‚ÄúIn any civilized system the same agreements, provided that they are entered into voluntarily and in good faith, will be enforced - as of course they should be. We did [the same thing] by discovering or inventing, in appropriate cases, ‚Äòexceptions‚Äô from the ‚Äògeneral rule‚Äô - which makes the resulting pattern look a good deal more complicated than it really is, with the result that people - including lawyers and judges - are sometimes led astray.‚Äù Historically, there are examples of ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù carved out even under absolute liability assumptions, thus almost always providing for what would be perceived as a just result. Similarly, the remedies for breach of contract have broadened beyond what was originally allowed.\n\nGilmore begins the final chapter by stating that perhaps, ‚Äúwe might say that what is happening is that ‚Äòcontract‚Äô is being reabsorbed into the mainstream of ‚Äòtort‚Äô‚Äù. The artificial divisions that were used to carve contract theory out of tort a hundred years ago have all but crumbled. With all of the exceptions in contract law, liability in contract is no longer very different from liability in tort, and the merging of damages is not far behind. Quite comically, Gilmore suggests that the merging of contracts and torts should be reflected in legal education in a class called ‚ÄúContorts‚Äù. Gilmore pays heed to the justifications for creating a theory of contract in the first place. Around the start of the 20th century, the legal climate was one that feared legal individualism among the states, and therefore, a general theory of contract law was appealing as it could transcend state lines. At the same time, taking commercial issues and deciding them under contract law and the guise of ‚Äúquestions of law‚Äù kept them from being decided by inconsistent and unreliable juries. In closing, Gilmore notes the constantly changing tides of legal thought, and states that ‚ÄúContract is dead - but who knows what unlikely resurrection the Easter-tide may bring?‚Äù\n\n"}
