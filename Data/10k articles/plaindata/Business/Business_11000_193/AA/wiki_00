Disney (born January 24, 1960 in Los Angeles, California) is an American documentary filmmaker, philanthropist, and activist known for her documentary films focused on social themes. She is the Executive Producer and Director of the film \"The Armor of Light\", which premiered at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nAbigail Disney was raised in North Hollywood, California, and was educated at Yale (BA), Stanford (MA, English Lit), and Columbia (PhD, English Lit). She is the daughter of Patricia Ann (née Dailey) and Roy E. Disney and granddaughter of Roy O. Disney, co-founder of The Walt Disney Company with her great uncle Walt Disney.\n\nShe turned to the family business of filmmaking with a documentary film, \"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\", directed by Academy Award-nominated, Emmy-winning filmmaker Gini Reticker. \"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\" brought to light the work of Liberian peace activist Leymah Gbowee by telling the story about the critical role women played in bringing peace to war torn Liberia. \"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\" won Best Documentary at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2008, and screened in 60 countries around the world on all seven continents. \n\nIn 2007, she and Gini Reticker founded Fork Films, a New York-based production company that seeks to shed light, evoke compassion, stir action and build peace. She is the President and CEO, and Reticker is the Chief Creative Officer. \n\nIn 2009, Fork Films and Film Sprout partnered together to create \"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\" Global Peace Tour, a nine-month grassroots screening tour that culminated on the United Nations' International Day of Peace on September 21, 2009. In total, the tour brought the film to 31 foreign countries, 45 U.S. states and 235 U.S. cities. The film is broadly credited with highlighting the bravery and sacrifice of its lead figure, Leymah Gbowee, who received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2011.\n\nThe response to \"Pray the Devil Back to Hell\" led Disney to work on the five-part special series for PBS, \"Women, War & Peace\", which aired in 2011 and was the winner of the Overseas Press Club's Edward R. Murrow Award, a Gracie Award, a Television Academy Honor and the America Bar Association's Silver Gavel Award (for \"I Came to Testify\"). This series created and executive produced by Abigail Disney, Pamela Hogan and Gini Reticker looked at the role of women in war in the modern age, not just as victims of conflict, but as active agents for peace in their communities. Also in 2011, Disney received an Athena Film Festival Award for her extraordinary use of film for social change.\n\nDisney executive produced \"The Trials of Spring\" (2015), a major documentary event that includes a feature-length documentary, six short films, articles by award-winning journalists, and an ongoing robust social media conversation about women and their unwavering quest for social justice and freedom. The feature film, directed by Gini Reticker, chronicles the story of 21-year-old Hend Nafea, who sets out on a search for freedom and justice in a country gripped by a dangerous power struggle where there is little tolerance for the likes of her. The six short films were featured on \"The New York Times\" homepage in the six days leading up to the world premiere of \"The Trials of Spring\" at the Human Rights Watch Film Festival in New York City in June 2015.\n\nDisney made her directorial debut with \"The Armor of Light,\" which follows pro-life evangelical minister Rev. Rob Schenck, Lucy McBath, the mother of teenager Jordan Davis, and John Michael Phillips. Jordan Davis was gunned down in Jacksonville, Florida on November 23, 2012. Davis was unarmed at the time of his death, and his story has cast a spotlight on \"Stand Your Ground\" laws in the United States. The film follows Rev. Schenck as he meets McBath, a pro-choice Christian, and her attorney John Phillips. It leads to the question: is it possible to be both pro-gun and pro-life? \"The Armor of Light\" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2015 before opening theatrically on October 30, 2015. In 2017, it was nominated for an Emmy Award.\n\nDisney and her husband Pierre Hauser created The Daphne Foundation in 1991 in order to fund programs that confront the causes and consequences of poverty in the five boroughs of New York City.\n\nIn 2008, Disney launched Peace is Loud, a nonprofit organization that inspires action through media and live events that spotlight women leaders on the frontlines of peacebuilding worldwide. The organization’s mission is to generate a groundswell of people committed to building a culture of peace. Disney serves as the Founder and President.\n\nDisney has made several overseas trips with fellow peace activists, including Nobel laureate Leymah Gbowee. The two traveled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2011 to spend a week working with women peace activists and to explore ideas for building peace in their country. The following year, they visited Sri Lanka, where women activists launched the Sri Lankan Women's Agenda on Peace, Security and Development, inspired by Gbowee's legacy.\n\nIn 2012 she renounced her share of the profits from the Disney family investment in the Ahava cosmetics company whose factory is located in a West Bank settlement. She stated \"I cannot in good conscience profit from what is technically the 'plunder' or 'pillage' of occupied natural resources...\" For legal reasons she could not withdraw her investments and therefore donated the investments and profits \"to organizations working to end this illegal exploitation.\"\n\nIn May 2015, Disney joined Gbowee and 28 other international women peacebuilders to cross the 2-mile wide De-Militarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea in an act of solidarity with Korean women and to call for an end to the Korean War. The peacebuilders headed international peace symposia in Pyongyang and Seoul, where they listened to Korean women and shared experiences of mobilizing women to end conflict.\n\nDisney married Pierre Norman Hauser in 1988 and has four children. Her first son is named Henry. She lives in New York City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There are four basic types of software that address anti-money laundering:\ntransaction monitoring systems, currency transaction reporting (CTR) systems, customer identity management systems and compliance management software.\n\nAnti-money laundering guidelines came into prominence globally after the September 11, 2001 attacks and the subsequent enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act in the United States and the establishment of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF). By 2010 many jurisdictions globally required financial institutions to monitor, investigate and report transactions of a suspicious nature to the financial intelligence unit in their respective country.\n\nAn entire industry developed around providing software to analyze transactions in an attempt to identify transactions or patterns of transactions, called structuring, which requires a SAR filing, or other suspicious patterns that qualify for SAR reporting. Financial institutions faced penalties for failing to properly file CTR and SAR reports, including heavy fines and regulatory restrictions, even to the point of charter revocation.\n\nThere are four basic types of software addressing AML business requirements:\n\nThese software applications effectively monitor bank customer transactions on a daily basis and, using customer historical information and account profile, provide a \"whole picture\" to the bank management.

{"id": "4231933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4231933", "title": "Blue Ocean Strategy", "text": "Blue Ocean Strategy\n\nBlue Ocean Strategy is a marketing theory from a book published in 2004 which was written by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, professors at INSEAD.\n\nBased on a study of 150 strategic moves spanning more than a hundred years and thirty industries, Kim and Mauborgne argue that companies can succeed by creating \"blue oceans\" of uncontested market space, as opposed to \"red oceans\" where competitors fight for dominance, the analogy being that an ocean full of vicious competition turns red with blood.\n\nThey assert that these strategic moves create a leap in value for the company, its buyers, and its employees while unlocking new demand and making the competition irrelevant. The book presents analytical frameworks and tools to foster an organization's ability to systematically create and capture blue oceans. The expanded edition of Blue Ocean Strategy was published in February, 2015.\n\nThe book is divided into three parts:\nas the other scenarios differ from those mentioned below would be an entirely separate story vice versa.\n\n1. The first part presents key concepts of blue ocean strategy, including Value Innovation – the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost – and key analytical tools and frameworks such as the strategy canvas and the four actions framework. The four actions framework aids in eliminating the trade-off between differentiation and low cost within a company. The four actions framework consists of the following:\n\n\n2. The second part describes the four principles of blue ocean strategy formulation. These four formulation principles address how an organization can create blue oceans by looking across the six conventional boundaries of competition (Six Paths Framework), reduce their planning risk by following the four steps of visualizing strategy, create new demand by unlocking the three tiers of noncustomers and launch a commercially viable blue ocean idea by aligning unprecedented utility of an offering with strategic pricing and target costing and by overcoming adoption hurdles. The book uses many examples across industries to demonstrate how to break out of traditional competitive (structuralist) strategic thinking and to grow demand and profits for the company and the industry by using blue ocean (reconstructionist) strategic thinking. The four principles are:\n3. The third and final part describes the two key implementation principles of blue ocean strategy including tipping point leadership and fair process. These implementation principles are essential for leaders to overcome the four key organizational hurdles that can prevent even the best strategies from being executed. The four key hurdles comprise the cognitive, resource, motivational and political hurdles that prevent people involved in strategy execution from understanding the need to break from status quo, finding the resources to implement the new strategic shift, keeping your people committed to implementing the new strategy, and from overcoming the powerful vested interests that may block the change.\n\nIn the book the authors draw the attention of their readers towards the correlation of success stories across industries and the formulation of strategies that provide a solid base to create unconventional success – a strategy termed as \"blue ocean strategy\". Unlike the \"red ocean strategy\", the conventional approach to business of beating competition derived from the military organization, the \"blue ocean strategy\" tries to align innovation with utility, price and cost positions. The book mocks at the phenomena of conventional choice between product/service differentiation and lower cost, but rather suggests that both differentiation and lower costs are achievable simultaneously.\n\nThe authors ask readers \"What is the best unit of analysis of profitable growth? Company? Industry?\" – a fundamental question without which any strategy for profitable growth is not worthwhile. The authors justify with original and practical ideas that neither the company nor the industry is the best unit of analysis of profitable growth; rather it is the strategic move that creates \"blue ocean\" and sustained high performance. The book examines the experience of companies in areas as diverse as watches, wine, cement, computers, automobiles, textiles, coffee makers, airlines, retailers, and even the circus, to answer this fundamental question and builds upon the argument about \"value innovation\" being the cornerstone of a blue ocean strategy. Value innovation is necessarily the alignment of innovation with utility, price and cost positions. This creates uncontested market space and makes competition irrelevant. The new chapters in the expanded edition of the book deal with the issues of how to develop and align the three strategy propositions of value, profit and people, how to sustain and renew blue ocean strategy at both the business level and the corporate level, and how to avoid red ocean traps that keep organizations anchored in existing market space even as they attempt to create new market space. The following section discusses the concept behind the book in detail.\n\nThe metaphor of red and blue oceans describes the market universe.\n\nRed oceans represent all the industries in existence today – the known market space. In the red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known. Here companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of product or service demand. As the market space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities or niche, and cutthroat competition turns the ocean bloody; hence, the term \"red oceans\".\n\nBlue oceans, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. Blue ocean is an analogy to describe the wider, deeper potential of market space that is not yet explored.\n\nThe cornerstone of blue ocean strategy is \"value innovation\", a concept originally outlined in Kim & Mauborgne's 1997 article \"Value Innovation - The Strategic Logic of High Growth\". Value innovation is the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost, creating value for both the buyer, the company, and its employees, thereby opening up new and uncontested market space. The aim of value innovation, as articulated in the article, is not to compete, but to make the competition irrelevant by changing the playing field of strategy. The strategic move must raise and create value for the market, while simultaneously reducing or eliminating features or services that are less valued by the current or future market. The Four Actions Framework is used to help create value innovation and break the value-cost trade-off. Value innovation challenges Michael Porter's idea that successful businesses are either low-cost providers or niche-players. Instead, blue ocean strategy proposes finding value that crosses conventional market segmentation and offering value \"and\" lower cost. Educator Charles W. L. Hill proposed a similar idea in 1988 and claimed that Porter's model was flawed because differentiation can be a means for firms to achieve low cost. He proposed that a combination of differentiation and low cost might be necessary for firms to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nMany others have proposed similar strategies. For example, Swedish educators Jonas Ridderstråle and Kjell Nordström in their 1999 book \"Funky Business\" follow a similar line of reasoning. For example, \"competing factors\" in blue ocean strategy are similar to the definition of \"finite and infinite dimensions\" in \"Funky Business\". Just as blue ocean strategy claims that a red ocean strategy does not guarantee success, \"Funky Business\" explained that \"Competitive Strategy is the route to nowhere\". \"Funky Business\" argues that firms need to create \"sensational strategies\". Just like blue ocean strategy, a sensational strategy is about \"playing a different game\" according to Ridderstråle and Nordström. Ridderstråle and Nordström also claim that the aim of companies is to create temporary monopolies. Kim and Mauborgne explain that the aim of companies is to create blue oceans, that will eventually turn red. This is the same idea expressed in the form of an analogy. Ridderstråle and Nordström also claimed in 1999 that \"in the slow-growth 1990s overcapacity is the norm in most businesses\". Kim and Mauborgne claim that blue ocean strategy makes sense in a world where supply exceeds demand.\n\nKim and Mauborgne argue that while traditional competition-based strategies (red ocean strategies) are necessary, they are not sufficient to sustain high performance. Companies need to go beyond competing. To seize new profit and growth opportunities they also need to create blue oceans. The authors argue that competition based strategies assume that an industry's structural conditions are given and that firms are forced to compete within them, an assumption based on what academics call the structuralist view, or environmental determinism. To sustain themselves in the marketplace, practitioners of red ocean strategy focus on building advantages over the competition, usually by assessing what competitors do and striving to do it better. Here, grabbing a bigger share of the market is seen as a zero-sum game in which one company's gain is achieved at another company’s loss. Hence, competition, the supply side of the equation, becomes the defining variable of strategy. Here, cost and value are seen as trade-offs and a firm chooses a distinctive cost or differentiation position. Because the total profit level of the industry is also determined by structural factors, firms principally seek to capture and redistribute wealth instead of creating wealth. They focus on dividing up the red ocean, where growth is increasingly limited.\n\nBlue ocean strategy, on the other hand, is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players. This is what the authors call \"the reconstructionist view\". Assuming that structure and market boundaries exist only in managers’ minds, practitioners who hold this view do not let existing market structures limit their thinking. To them, extra demand is out there, largely untapped. The crux of the problem is how to create it. This, in turn, requires a shift of attention from supply to demand, from a focus on competing to a focus on \"value innovation\" – that is, the creation of innovative value to unlock new demand. This is achieved via the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low-cost. As market structure is changed by breaking the value/cost tradeoff, so are the rules of the game. Competition in the old game is therefore rendered irrelevant. By expanding the demand side of the economy, new wealth is created. Such a strategy therefore allows firms to largely play a non–zero-sum game, with high payoff possibilities.\n\nSome examples of companies that may have created new market spaces in the opinion of Kim and Mauborgne include:\n\nReports of businesses using blue ocean strategy concepts include:\n\n\nSince \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" was published in 2005 it has been translated into 43 languages and has sold over 3.5 million copies. The book was named a bestseller by the Wall Street Journal, BusinessWeek, and Amazon.com. It was selected as one of the “Best Books of 2005” by Fast Company magazine, won “The Best Business Book of 2005” Prize at the Frankfurt Book Fair, and achieved bestselling book of the decade status by 800-CEO-READ (2000-2010). Strategy+Business magazine selected it as #1 strategy book of 2005.\n\nIn 2009, \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" was selected by the China Daily and the China Research Institute as one of the 40 most influential books in the History of the People's Republic of China (1949-2009) along with Adam Smith’s ″The Wealth of Nations″ under the category of ″Economics and Finance.″ In 2010, Polish group ThinkTank selected \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" as one of the Top 20 books that have shaped Polish Leaders. \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" won the Thinkers50 2011 Strategy Award for Best Business Book of the decade and in the same year, it was introduced to the Fast Company Leadership Hall of Fame. In 2013, the book received the GoodBooks Award in the Management category by the Vietnamese Institute for Research on Education Development (IRED), was selected as one of the 15 Best Business Books of the last decade in Russia by the Kommersant.ru magazine, and selected as one of the top three best management books in Japan by the Diamond Harvard Business Review.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal recommends \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" for the top manager. Forbes calls it one of the ten business trends for 2013 and argues that \"blue ocean strategies are more influential than ever.\" BusinessWeek says that \"\"Blue Ocean Strategy\" will have you wondering why companies need so much persuasion to stay out of shark-infested waters.\" The Business Strategy Review said the book \"challenges everything you knew about strategy\", and the Business Times called on firms to \"adopt blue ocean strategy to stay ahead.\" Marketplace magazine recommends \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" as a book \"you need to read.\" In addition, the book has received many positive reviews from various publications that include Chicago Tribune, Daily Herald, Credit Union Journal, Vancouver Sun, Association Meetings, Strategy & Leadership, and Business First, among many others.\n\nWhile Kim and Mauborgne propose approaches to finding uncontested market space, at the present there are few success stories of companies that have actively applied their theories. One success story that does exist is Nintendo, who first applied the blue ocean strategy to create the Nintendo DS handheld game system which was the first portable gaming system to offer dual-screen gaming and a touch screen in 2004. In 2006, Nintendo released the Wii, which used unique motion controls. The 3DS is Nintendo's third endeavour for its blue ocean strategy. Its first two attempts, the Nintendo DS and Wii, were wildly successful, becoming some of the biggest selling platforms in history. Nintendo revealed their Blue Ocean Strategy during an E3 press conference during the hype build-up of the Wii.\n\nHowever, with just one case study, this hole in their data persists despite the publication of value innovation concepts dating back to 1997. Hence, a critical question is whether this book and its related ideas are \"descriptive\" rather than \"prescriptive.\" The authors present many examples of successful innovations, and then explain from their Blue Ocean perspective – essentially interpreting success through their lenses.\n\nThe research process followed by the authors has been criticized on several grounds. Criticisms include claims that no control group was used, that there is no way to know how many companies using a blue ocean strategy failed and the theory is thus unfalsifiable, that a deductive process was not followed, and that the examples in the book were selected to \"tell a winning story\".\n\nAdditionally, blue ocean strategy cannot be identified as true causation for success. The authors cite the strategies used by NYPD Commissioner Bratton as a key example of Blue Ocean applied in the public sector. They defined this success as a significant drop in crime in the City of New York after Bratton took office in 1994. Many social scientists would disagree that it was Bratton's policies that led to crime reduction: rather, the city was simply part of a nationwide trend in decreasing crime.\n\nBrand and communication are taken for granted and do not represent a key for success. Kim and Maubourgne take the marketing of a value innovation as a given, assuming the marketing success will come as a matter of course.\n\nIt is argued that rather than a theory, blue ocean strategy is an extremely successful attempt to brand a set of already existing concepts and frameworks with a highly \"sticky\" idea. The blue ocean/red ocean analogy is a powerful and memorable metaphor, which is responsible for its popularity. This metaphor can be powerful enough to stimulate people to action. However, the concepts behind the Blue Ocean Strategy (such as the competing factors, the consumer cycle, non-customers, etc.) are not new. Many of these tools are also used by Six Sigma practitioners and proposed by other management theorists.\n\nMany of the book's key concepts were previously covered in \"Competing For The Future\" by Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad, which was published in 1996. The authors encouraged managers to stake out new marketing space, which they termed \"white space\", in order to \"create and dominate emerging opportunities\".\n\n\n"}

One prisoner recalls Boonpong was the merchant with the lowest prices and the smallest mark up. However he performed other services risking his life and those of his family. He lent money, provided extra medicines and ran messages. With access to medicines, the death rate of the prisoners was reduced from five a day in May 1943 to one a week by the following November.\n\nAfter the war, Boonpong was attacked by Thai police in some mistaken retribution. Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop, another hero of the POW camps, ordered a report on 'the condition of Mr. Boonpong, injured Thai civilian, who had done so much for prisoners of war.’ In 1947 he was in financial difficulties and so a POW association on hearing of it organised a collection for him. Shortly thereafter, Boonpong started the Boonpong Bus Company. In 1948 he was awarded the MBE by the British Government.\n\nLater an Australian medical scholarship was named in honor of him and Sir Edward Dunlop. The documentary film “The Quiet Lions” is about both of them. Boonpong also figures prominently in \"Beyond the Bamboo Screen\", a collection of anecdotes by Scottish PoWs.\n\nRungsak Loychusak portrayed Boonpong Sirivejjabhandu in \"Boonpong\" a thai television soap opera based on the true story him. \"Boonpong\" was broadcast on Thai PBS during 8 May 2013 - 20 June 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

Moss, it opened as \"B.S. Moss's Colony Theatre\" on Christmas Day 1924 as a venue for vaudeville shows and motion pictures. The theater has operated under many names and owners. It was renamed \"Universal's Colony Theatre\", \"B.S. Moss' Broadway Theatre\", and \"Earl Carroll's Broadway Theatre\" before becoming a legitimate theater house simply called \"Broadway Theatre\" on December 8, 1930. In 1937, known as \"Ciné Roma\", it showed Italian films. For a short time during the 1950s it showed Cinerama films.\n\nOn November 18, 1928 the first Mickey Mouse cartoon released to the public, Steamboat Willie, debuted at the Colony. Producer Walt Disney returned on November 13, 1940 to debut the feature film \"Fantasia\" in Fantasound, an early stereo system. \n\nThe legitimate theater opened in 1930 with \"The New Yorkers\" by Cole Porter. Stars such as Milton Berle, Alfred Drake, José Ferrer, Eartha Kitt, Vivien Leigh, Zero Mostel, and Mae West have appeared on stage.\n\nThe Shubert Organization bought the theater in 1939 and renovated it extensively in 1956 and 1986. It has long been a popular theatre for producers of musicals because of large seating capacity, and the large stage, which is nearly sixty feet deep. Often plays that have become successful in smaller theaters have transferred to the Broadway Theatre.\n\n\n"}

The building's materials include terra cotta and brick. It was built in 1927 as Barlum Tower. At the top of the tower is a tall guyed mast for local radio stations WMXD, WDTW-FM and television station WLPC-CD. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\n\nCadillac Tower was the first building outside New York City and Chicago to have 40 floors, including two below ground. The building also houses the city of Detroit's Planning and Development Department, and its Recreation Department. Cadillac Tower's decorative cornices and parapets are of varying heights. The corner spires rise to a height of , and the spires at the middle façade rise to the same height of the mechanical penthouse at .\n\nFrom 1994 to 2000, one side of the building featured a 14-story mural of Detroit Lions star player Barry Sanders. The mural was retired after a six-year deal with Nike expired. That mural was then replaced with one of Detroit Red Wings star Steve Yzerman. Currently the building features an ad for the MGM Grand Detroit Casino featuring a lion.\n\nIn January 2008, the City of Detroit and Cadillac Tower's owner Northern Group, Inc., announced plans for Cadillac Centre, a $150-million mixed-use residential entertainment-retail complex attached to the skyscraper. Designed by architect Anthony Caradonna, the contemporary steel and glass 24-story center would have filled in the currently vacant Monroe Block adjacent to Campus Martius. This project was put on indefinite hold ultimately being replaced by Meridian Health Plan's future headquarters.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1377347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1377347", "title": "Connaught Place, New Delhi", "text": "Connaught Place, New Delhi\n\nConnaught Place is one of the largest financial, commercial and business centres in New Delhi, India. It is often abbreviated as CP and houses the headquarters of several noted Indian firms. As of July 2018, Connaught Place was the ninth most expensive office location in the world with an annual rent of USD 153 per sq ft.\n\nThe main commercial area of the new city, New Delhi, occupies a place of pride in the city and are counted among the top heritage structures in New Delhi. It was developed as a showpiece of Lutyens' Delhi with a prominent Central Business District(Delhi)\nNamed after Prince Arthur, 1st Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, construction work began in 1929 and was completed in 1933. However currently the design is in a poor state of repair with unsympathetic infill of balconies, mismatched shop fronts and development of central park significantly undermining the integrity of Robert Tor Russell's plans.\n\nA metro railway station built under it is named Rajiv Chowk (after Rajiv Gandhi).\n\nPrior to the construction of Connaught Place, the area was a ridge, covered with \"kikar\" trees and populated with jackals and wild pigs. Residents of the Kashmere Gate, Civil Lines area visited during the weekends for partridge hunting. The Hanuman Temple attracted many visitors from the old walled city, who came only on Tuesdays and Saturdays and before sunset, as the return trip was considered dangerous.\n\nResidents of villages including \"Madhoganj\", \"Jaisingh Pura\" and \"Raja ka Bazaar\" were evicted to clear the area for the construction of Connaught Place and the development of its nearby areas. The villages were once situated along the historic Qutb Road, the main road connecting Shahjahanabad, the walled city of Delhi (now known as Old Delhi) to Qutb Minar in south Delhi since the Mughal era. The displaced people were relocated in Karol Bagh to the west, a rocky area populated only by trees and wild bushes. However, three structures were spared demolition. These were Hanuman temple, a Jain temple in Jaisinghpura and the Jantar Mantar.\n\nNamed after Prince Arthur, 1st Duke of Connaught (1850–1942), third son of Queen Victoria and uncle of King George VI of England, who visited India in 1921 and laid the foundation of the \"Council House\" (now Sansad Bhavan, or Parliament House).\n\nConnaught Place's Georgian architecture is modelled after the Royal Crescent in Bath, designed by the architect John Wood the Younger and built between 1767 and 1774. While the Royal Crescent is semi-circular and a three storied residential structure, Connaught Place had only two floors, which made almost a complete circle intended to house commercial establishments on the ground with residential space on the first floor. The circle was eventually designed with two concentric circles, creating an Inner Circle, Middle Circle and the Outer Circle with seven roads radiating from a circular central park. As per the original plan, the different blocks of Connaught Place were to be joined from above, employing archways, with radial roads below them. However, the circle was 'broken up' to give it a grander scale. Even the blocks were originally planned to be in height, but later reduced to the present two-storied structure with an open colonnade.\n\nGovernment plans to have New Delhi Railway Station built inside Central Park were rejected by railway authorities as they found the idea impractical, and instead chose the nearby Paharganj area. Finally construction work began in 1929, with construction of the Viceroy House (present Rashtrapati Bhavan), Secretariat Building, Parliament House, and All-India War Memorial, India Gate were completed by 1933, long after the inauguration of the city in 1931.\n\nEarly commercial establishments belonged to traders from the Kashmere Gate area: Kanter's, Galgotia and Snowhite. Most of the rulers of the Indian princely states had their local homes in the nearby areas around King's way (modern-day Rajpath), and would frequent shops for designer clothes, artefacts, shoes, and pianos. Regal cinema, the first cinema in Connaught Place, opened around this time and went on to host popular concerts, theatre groups, and ballet performances.The Odeon and Rivoli followed the Regal, while the Indian Talkie House opened in 1938. Initially only Indian snacks were available in the area, but gradually restaurants opened in the plaza, with names like Kwality, United Coffee House and others offering Continental and Mughlai cuisines. Wenger's, the confectioners, was one of the first shops in Connaught Place, the firm also owned the largest restaurant in New Delhi on the first floor of their present A-Block outlet. Originally established in 1926 as Spencers in Kashmere Gate, Wenger's was owned by a Swiss couple and introduced Delhi to pastries and homemade Swiss chocolates, though in its early years it too was patronised mostly by British officers, Indian royalty and some foreign-returned businessmen, for Delhi was still the city of classical taste within the walled city. Davico's across Connaught Plaza, and the Standard restaurant was popular for decades before fading away. Another old timer, the Embassy Restaurant, opened in 1948.\n\nThe Imperial, New Delhi’s first luxury hotel opened in 1931 on Queen's Way, (modern-day Janpath) and eventually became a haunt for the royalty and a place for political discussions. It was here that Jawaharlal Nehru, Mohandas K. Gandhi, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Lord Mountbatten met to discuss the Partition of India and the birth of Pakistan.\n\nResidents gradually moved into first floor quarters, which were almost full by 1938, but it was another decade before the plaza became the busy marketplace that it became later, as World War II started and the Independence movement reached a feverish pitch. Markets experienced dwindling sales, but post-independence business began to increase in the 1950s.\n\nUntil the 1980s, a \"Phatphat Sewa\", a Harley Davidson rickshaw service, took visitors from Connaught Place to the Red Fort and Chandani Chowk, before it was stopped due to pollution concerns. The empty block of the Inner Circle came into use in the late 1970s with the construction of an underground market, the first in Delhi, \"Palika Bazaar\" at the junction point. Stretching up to the Outer Circle, it also came with an adjoining underground parking lot. Also in the 1970s, the State Emporiums on Baba Karak Singh Marg radial emerged. However, a major alteration in the skyline was the addition of red sandstone (inspired by the historic Red Fort) and glass skyscraper, the \"Jeevan Bharti\" building (LIC building), designed by architect Charles Correa. In 1986, it towered over the low-lying and predominantly white Connaught Place and was criticised for being too futuristic, but gradually as other skyscrapers were built on the periphery, the debate faded away.\n\nAfter the introduction of talkies to Indian cinema in 1931, the new medium became a craze and in the 1930s and the 40s, four theatres opened within Connaught Place Plaza: Regal, Rivoli, Odeon and a short-lived \"Indian Talkie House\" that opened in 1938. Connaught Place became the entertainment hub of New Delhi. The Regal, the first theatre in the area, was opened in 1932 by Sir Sobha Singh. It was designed by architect Walter Sykes George and mainly hosted stage performances. In the coming years it hosted Western Classical music artists, Russian ballet and British theatre groups, and soon started morning and afternoon movie shows. The next theatre to be built was the Plaza in 1940, designed by Sir Robert Tor Russell, the architect of Connaught Place itself. It was owned by director and actor Sohrab Modi until the early 1950s. The Odeon was built in 1945 and had the city’s second 70mm screen after the \"Shiela Cinema\" in Paharganj. The Rivoli, close to the Regal, was the smallest theatre in the area. Half a century later most of the theatres were still running, although most had changed ownership. The Plaza and Rivoli are now owned by multiplex giant PVR Cinemas, while the Odeon is a joint venture with Reliance Big Pictures.\n\nThe area is instantly recognisable on any map of Delhi as a big circle in the middle with radial roads spreading out in all directions. Eight separate roads lead out from Connaught Places's inner circle, named Parliament Street and Radial Roads 1 through 7. Twelve different roads lead out from Connaught Circus, the outer ring. The best known of these is Janpath, the continuation of Radial Road 1. It is a logically planned area and houses one of India's first underground markets, the Palika Bazaar (Municipal Market), named after \"nagarpalika\". The Outer Circle is known as the Connaught Circus (officially Indira Chowk), having rows of restaurants, shops and hotels, and on December 1, 2017, The Regal Building was reopened as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, the very first in India. The Middle Circle has offices, Banks, Exchange houses such as Thomascook, Atwexchange, PVR cinema and eating outlets.\n\nConnaught Place's central park has long been a venue for cultural events and is a popular hangout for locals. In 2005–06, it was rebuilt after the construction of the Delhi Metro station below it. That station, Rajiv Chowk, is the interchange for the Yellow and Blue lines of the Metro and one of the largest and busiest stations in the network.\n\nConnaught Place hosts various cultural events in the central park area such as the Urdu Heritage Festival, One Billion Rising demonstrations, Delhi Government's Youth Festival, \"Awam Ki Awaz\" (Voices of People) concert and many others.\n\nThe first known Indian to hoist the tricolour flag at Connaught Place is Padma Shri Mir Mushtaq Ahmad, the first Chief Executive Councillor of Delhi. Prior to independence, when Connaught Place was considered the heart of imperial British India, he would hoist the tricolour at the bandstand in Central Park each year on 26 January. On 7March 2014, the largest known Indian national tricolour at that time (now second largest) was hoisted at the centre of Central Park, measuring . The pole on which it is hoisted measures \n\nTwo of the five terrorist blasts that occurred during the 13 September 2008 Delhi bombings were in Connaught Place. Ten people were injured after police and witnesses said that the bombs went off in garbage cans in and around Connaught Place. There was also one bomb blast in nearby Central Park. Authorities also discovered two undetonated bombs in Delhi, one located at the Regal cinema complex in Connaught Place. As a response, all rubbish bins were removed from the area for security reasons.\n\nBy the late 2000s Connaught Place had lost much of its old glory, although the charm of the market continued to attract foot traffic. As a part of its 'Return to Heritage Project', the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) prepared a plan to revamp and redevelop this Delhi landmark. The plan included provision of heritage sensitive signage, engineering improvements of roads, drainage sewerage, water supply and substations, development of a traffic management plan, provisions of street furniture including adequate parking, walkways etc. and enhancing the structural stability of all buildings including retrofitting for earthquake resistance. All these components have been identified based on studies conducted by various reputed agencies such as SPA, RITES, CMCCC and NTPAC, etc.\n\nThe redevelopment work was slated to be completed in time for the 2010 Commonwealth Games held at Delhi, but due to huge cost overruns and undue delays, this deadline was not met. The Performance Audit Report prepared by Controller and Auditor General, India, on the Commonwealth Games 2010 concluded that there were \"significant deficiencies in contract management, with consequent avoidable expenditure\". Moreover, the mis-management and delays caused great inconvenience to shoppers and shop-owners alike, and led to a decline in trade. Many store-owners complained of erratic power supplies and lost air-conditioning in their shops during the renovation work.\n\nWork on the renovation was resumed soon after the Commonwealth Games, and is currently scheduled to meet the new deadline of December 2012. Till 2016 only the first phase for renovating blocks A & B has taken place. By 2020 all the six blocks of Connaught Place would be renovated and brought to their original glory.\n\nThe art project United Buddy Bears was presented in Connaught Place during the summer of 2012.\n\nOn January 5, 2017, the Union Urban Development Ministry announced a plan to convert the middle and inner circles of Connaught Place, into an exclusive pedestrian zone, starting February 2017. As a result, people driving into the area will now have to park their vehicles at designated parking slots like Shivaji Stadium, Palika Bazaar and then either walk to Connaught Place or use the shuttle bus service. However, Bicycles will be allowed in the pedestrian zones.\nThis move however does not have any planning as of January 24, 2017 and may be totally scrapped as the current infrastructure is insufficient to support the pedestrianisation of Connaught Place, Naresh Kumar Chairman of NDMC Reported Hindustan Times.\n\nOver the years, Connaught Place has been location many films including sequences in \"Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi\" (2003), \"Pyaar Ke Side Effects\" (2006), \"3 Idiots\" (2009), \"Aisha\" (2010), \"Delhi Belly\" (2011), \"Rockstar\" (2011), \"Ahista Ahista\" (2006), \"Agent Vinod (2012 film)\",\n\"Vicky Donor\" (2012), \"Hate Story\" (2011), \"Special 26\" (2013), \"A Wednesday\" (2008), \"Rang De Basanti\" (2006), \"PK\" (2014) and \"2 States\" (2014)\n\nOther commercial centres in Delhi metropolitan area:\n\n"}

It can also refer to local manufacture via the historic cottage industry model, or manufacturing that takes place in the homes of consumers.\n\nWithin the maker movement and DIY culture, small scale production by consumers often using peer to peer resources is being referred to as distributed manufacturing. Consumers download digital designs from an open design repository website like Youmagine or Thingiverse and produce a product for low costs through a distributed network of 3D printing services such as 3D Hubs or at home with an open-source 3-D printer such as the RepRap. \n\nThe primary attribute of distributed manufacturing is the ability to create value at geographically dispersed locations via manufacturing. For example, shipping costs could be minimized when products are built geographically close to their intended markets. Also, products manufactured in a number of small facilities distributed over a wide area can be customized with details adapted to individual or regional tastes. Manufacturing components in different physical locations and then managing the supply chain to bring them together for final assembly of a product is also considered a form of distributed manufacturing. Digital networks combined with additive manufacturing allow companies a decentralized and geographically independent distributed production (Cloud manufacturing).\n\nSome call attention to the conjunction of Commons-based peer production with distributed manufacturing techniques. The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, the civil society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customised productivity. Further, it is true that many issues, problems and threats rise due to the large democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones. For instance, the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications on counterfeiting and on \"intellectual property\". It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, Commons-based peer production and distributed manufacturing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools. And following Neil Gershenfeld in that “some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies”, commons-based peer production and distributed manufacturing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but act locally in response to certain problems and needs. This can take the most radical form --individual personal manufacturing.\n"}

Her cousin, Carl Rohman, acclaimed supporter of the Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, remembers her being a very confident young woman. Prior to the Depression, she was exposed to a high level of living. She was a passionate reader, especially on the subjects of interior design and miniature collecting.\nShe graduated from Lincoln High in 1932 and enrolled at the University of Nebraska. She only attended until 1934 because she wanted to help support her mother and sisters after her father abandoned the family for another woman. She lived with her aunt and uncle to help her three sisters pay for college, all of whom graduated.\nShe married Carl Kruger in 1939, and soon after became interested in miniature figures.\nShe worked as a secretary, then was quickly promoted to executive secretary. Lee Syndicate hired her as an accountant, despite her lack of knowledge in the area. After buying books and studying she became adept at the trade. \nDuring World War II, when most men were drafted, she was given war-time orders to hire and train women. Eventually she ran an all-woman accounting office until the war ended.\nEven once her collection started, she still worked these jobs and helped her husband manage Paramount Laundry. \nShe was interested in sketching plans; she drew the house her mother built at 1935 Dakota Street.\nHer accounting job allowed her to travel a lot. Her cousin, Carl (Ky), claimed that she would find many pieces for her collection on these trips.\n\n\"When she undertook something she did it right. She studied and studied until she got it right\" attested Carl Rohman Jr.\nShe began collecting in the 1930s. The height of her collecting took place in the 1970s and 1980s. She became a published author in \"Miniature Magazine\", commissioned outstanding miniature makers to create models from the American Neoclassical era, and reached out to collectors all over the country.\nAfter assessing the number of American Neoclassical, American colonial and Victorian pieces that she commissioned, it can be assumed those were her favorite eras. \nHer attention to detail was remarkable, as well as her records, documentation, and effort to learn as much about the eras as possible.\nAll of the models were created at 1:12 scale. The pieces ranged from furniture, decorative arts, and accessories, from nearly every English and American design style, from Renaissance to Early Modern, all of which she commissioned to look as accurate to the real pieces as possible. In 1968 alone, she wrote eighty-five different letters to collectors and artists across the country. The relationships represented varied in scope and familiarity. The key trends of these letters include writing multiple letters in one day (44% were written on Thursdays), and the increase of letters per month increasing to 34% in February. The patterns correlate with events that transpired in 1968, like the Chicago riots, her battle with undiagnosed dizzy spells, and a sprained arm that prevented her from writing. \nIn many of her letters she mentioned that she had an interest in creating 1:12 miniature rugs, many of which she gave away, despite the hours of work one required.\nShe worked on the Chippendale Back Stool that model maker, Eric Pearson, made custom for her. The flamestitch upholstery took 40 stitches per inch. In February, Eloise told Eunice Tuttle \"the upholstery in this case is driving me to despair.\" Her two main correspondents were Thomas Devereux and Ellen Krucker, and these letters included more personal information, like politics and new cars, much more than simply invoices for her collection. Krucker was one of the two artists (aside from Pearson) that Eloise's husband thought made \"worthwhile miniatures\".\nEloise rented the apartment across the hall from her home, just for storing her miniatures. \nTop artists are Eric Pearson with 236 pieces, Eugene Kupjack, Bob Carlisle, Warren Dick, Mell Prescott, and Betty Valentine.\nKruger died on November 19, 1995 at age 81. She was survived by her sister Jean, nephews Donald Campbell and Bob Campbell, and cousin Carl Rohman. Her collection was donated to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in 1997 and is now held in the Kruger Gallery inside the College of Architecture. This contribution included over eight hundred books on the subjects of architectural detailing, to histories in ceramics, iron work, interior design, and kitchen space planning, as well as her miniature collection of over 20,000 pieces, valued at $500,000. The Kruger Gallery now uses her collection to increase awareness of architectural and interior eras, and in the field of material culture. \"I think it's great [to be at UNL]. She valued education, she would be terribly pleased\" said her nephew Bob.\n"}

Such organizations include businesses, schools, interest-based user groups, clubs, charities, and governments. Enterprise software is an integral part of a (computer-based) information system.\n\nServices provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented tools, such as online shopping, and online payment processing, interactive product catalogue, automated billing systems, security, Business Process Management, enterprise content management, IT Service Management, customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, business intelligence, project management, collaboration, human resource management, manufacturing, occupational health and safety, enterprise application integration, and enterprise forms automation.\n\nAs enterprises have similar departments and systems in common, enterprise software is often available as a suite of customizable programs. Generally, the complexity of these tools requires specialist capabilities and specific knowledge.\n\nEnterprise Software describes a collection of computer programs with common business applications, tools for modeling how the entire organization works, and development tools for building applications unique to the organization. The software is intended to solve an enterprise-wide problem, rather than a departmental problem. Enterprise level software aims to improve the enterprise's productivity and efficiency by providing business logic support functionality.\n\nAccording to Martin Fowler, \"Enterprise applications are about the display, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation of business processes with that data.\"\n\nAlthough there is no single, widely accepted list of enterprise software characteristics, they generally include performance, scalability, and robustness. Furthermore, enterprise software typically has interfaces to other enterprise software (for example LDAP to directory services) and is centrally managed (a single admin page, for example).\n\nEnterprise application software performs business functions such as order processing, procurement, production scheduling, customer information management, energy management, and accounting. It is typically hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to a large number of users, typically over a computer network. This is in contrast to a single-user application that is executed on a user's personal computer and serves only one user at a time.\n\nEnterprise software can be categorized by business function. Each type of enterprise application can be considered a \"system\" due to the integration with a firm's business processes. Categories of enterprise software may overlap due to this systemic interpretation. For example, IBM's Business Intelligence platform (Cognos), integrates with a predictive analytics platform (SPSS) and can obtain records from its database packages (Infosphere, DB2). Blurred lines between package functions make delimitation difficult, and in many ways larger software companies define these somewhat arbitrary categories. Nevertheless, certain industry standard product categories have emerged, and these are shown below :\n\n"}

Craig\n\nFrederick Walter Scott Craig (10 December 1929 – 23 March 1989) was a Scottish psephologist and compiler of the standard reference books covering United Kingdom Parliamentary election results. He originally worked in public relations, compiling election results in his spare time which were published by the Scottish Unionist Party. In the late 1960s he launched his own business as a publisher of reference books, and also compiled various other statistics concerning British politics.\n\nCraig also had a political career of his own, initially as an election agent and then as a candidate. Efforts to get elected in his native Glasgow being unsuccessful, after he moved to Chichester in 1970 he was first elected to the District Council and later to West Sussex County Council. However he fell out with a faction in the local Conservative Party and launched a rebel group which led to his expulsion. Late in his life he suffered severe depression and he committed suicide at the age of 59.\n\nCraig was a native of Glasgow. He became interested in election statistics while still at school. He was active in the Scottish Unionist Party Association, and in 1954 began to contribute the 'Scottish Parliamentary Election Manual' of election results to the \"Yearbook for Scotland\", which the party published. Craig was unhappy with existing sources for election statistics and undertook research himself to correct the vote figures and discover the source of independent candidates, and his election manual became highly respected.\n\nAs a paid agent for the Unionist Party, Craig was the election agent for James Hutchison in Glasgow Scotstoun in the 1955 general election and for the Unionist parliamentary candidate in Rutherglen in 1964. He twice fought for election to the Glasgow City Corporation in the mid-1960s. His first attempt was in May 1966 when he came forward as an Independent Conservative candidate against the 'Progressive Party', a local alliance between Conservatives and Liberals which controlled the council, in Kelvinside ward. Craig offered to withdraw if the Progressive councillor would repudiate that party's policy on council house rents, and to sit as a Conservative if the party split up; the offer was rejected.\n\nIn September 1967 Craig was selected as official Conservative candidate for Gorbals ward in a byelection; he was one of seven candidates and attempted to stand out by distributing on the eve of poll 5,000 'wage packets' containing an appeal to vote for him. However Craig came third in the poll.\n\nHis research into elections continued and widened from Scotland to the whole of the United Kingdom, and he compiled a card index to all elections from 1918 onwards. In 1966 he had completed a manuscript of a reference book on statistics about elections since 1918, which was intended to be published in two volumes of 700 pages each to be part-funded by the Institute of Electoral Research; the calling of a general election annoyed him because he would have to add the statistics from it to the book. Craig took a decisive step in 1968 when he was paid off from his public relations job and set up Political Reference Publications, to publish his work. The first book to be published was \"British Parliamentary Election Statistics 1918–1966\" which summarised the results of every general election as well as giving a wealth of other information. Critical reception was very positive and Craig always considered it his favourite book. It has continued to be updated, under the title \"British Electoral Facts\".\n\nHis series of \"British Parliamentary Election Results\" began to appear the next year with the volume for 1918–1949. The series has been completed to run from the Reform Act of 1832 to date. Craig also started the \"Political Companion\", a quarterly update, which ran from 1969 to 1983. His work was a family affair with his wife Phyllis helping with the production and administration, and his daughters undertaking the proofreading. Craig pioneered the use of technology and put the source data onto computer readable tape; the distinctive clear layout of his books was a result of his use of early computer typesetting.\n\nIn 1970 he moved from Anniesland Cross in Glasgow to Chichester in West Sussex and established another company, Parliamentary Research Services, which eventually took over all his activities. His public relations background led to new lines of business including compilation of activities of members of parliament from votes in the House of Commons. He was part of the BBC team, albeit behind the camera, on their programme covering the 1970 general election; in 1972 he was asked to help by both the BBC and ITV, and decided to transfer to commercial television. In 1973 he was elected to Chichester District Council, but with the pressure of work caused by the two elections of 1974 he resigned his seat. When the candidate selected to replace him dropped out, Craig found that his busy period was over and was himself nominated to fight the by-election caused by his own resignation.\n\nCraig was a leading member of Chichester Concern, a group set up to oppose a pedestrianisation precinct in the centre of the city. He arranged for John Tyme, a lecturer in Environmental Studies at Sheffield Polytechnic who had made a name opposing motorway schemes, to come to a public inquiry and oppose it. Tyme was unable to persuade the inquiry to adjourn and consider alternatives, and had to return home.\n\nIn 1975 Craig criticised the extension of postal votes to people on holiday at the time of elections, arguing that there were \"very real dangers in any electoral system which permits extensive voting by post\". He thought it absurd to increase postal voting facilities which might lead to widespread abuse because there were many ways of committing electoral fraud.\n\nCraig used the prefaces and forewords of his books to express opinions on the electoral system, arguing in 1977 that the increasing numbers of fringe and frivolous candidates in Parliamentary elections made it necessary to raise the level of the deposit required for a nomination to be valid. He also criticised the ability of people with holiday homes to register to vote in two constituencies, on the grounds that they could choose to vote in the most marginal. Craig pointed out that while it was illegal for dual registered voters to vote twice, the penalties were minimal and the offence difficult to detect. In \"Chronology of British Parliamentary By-elections\", Craig decried the \"confusing and often misleading display of computer graphics\" used on television election programmes, and also noted the decline in newspaper coverage of by-election campaigns by the broadsheet newspapers.\n\nWhen the Home Affairs Select Committee conducted an inquiry into the Representation of the People Acts, Craig (through his company) submitted a memorandum calling for an increased deposit, prohibition of multiple registration, and prevention of candidates changing their names to ones similar to those of other candidates. He also pressed for Returning Officers to be compelled to send the official result of every Parliamentary election to the Clerk of the Crown.\n\nAt the West Sussex County Council election in 1981, Craig was elected as a Conservative councillor in Chichester West division, while his wife Phyllis won Chichester South division. He had been the Chairman of the Chichester City branch of Chichester Conservative Association for many years, but at a stormy meeting on 1 March 1982 he was voted out of office. When he spoke in support of his re-election, Craig had noted the presence of many unfamiliar faces and declared \"I will oppose wets and Left Wing infiltrators who would like to destroy this great party from within\". In November 1981 the Association had adopted a new policy under which it refused to pay election expenses for sitting councillors, although new candidates would be funded. Craig and the other sitting councillors considered this amounted to deselection and formed the 'Association of Conservative Councillors' which would raise funds for their election expenses.\n\nThe Association of Conservative Councillors chose Craig as its election agent and declared its intention to nominate candidates against those of the Conservative Association. The resignation of a Liberal councillor led to a by-election for Chichester District Council in Chichester West ward in June 1982; Phyllis Craig was nominated in opposition to the official Conservative. The Liberal candidate held the seat with a majority of 149, with Phyllis Craig receiving 250 votes. It was widely perceived that her intervention had led to the Liberals winning a seat which otherwise would have been Conservative. Craig and his wife had their annual subscriptions returned by the Conservative Association in January 1983, which he denounced as \"a back-door method of expulsion\" and \"a very nasty way of getting rid of someone.\"\n\nCraig and his wife stood as Independent Conservative candidates for Chichester District Council in the 1983 council elections, but were not successful. He did not stand for re-election to the County Council in 1985 when his term ended. He later became a member of Chichester and Bognor Regis Samaritans.\n\nFred and Phyllis Craig separated in January 1988, placing the future of his business in jeopardy. The news was considered so important that the House of Commons Library issued a note to alert journalists to it. Craig sold his publishing business to Dartmouth Publishing, which later became part of Ashgate Publishing; he retained editorial control. He could not come to terms with living on his own, and attempted suicide in 1988 by taking an overdose of pills; the dedication of \"Britain Votes 4\" written in May 1988 records his thanks to family and friends as well as medical staff. However over the Easter holiday in 1989 he was found dead in his car having run a pipe from the exhaust. The cause of death was certified as Carbon monoxide poisoning and the Coroner returned a verdict of suicide as \"from the circumstances and from the notes which have been left, I have no doubt he intended the result of what he did\".\n\nAfter his death, his papers were given to Professors Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher of the University of Plymouth.\n\n\nAs can be seen from the above list, Craig's chronological reference works on British elections, long considered definitive in their accuracy, are spread over five volumes, covering the years 1832–85, 1885–1918, 1918–49, 1950–73 and 1974–83.\n"}
{"id": "387109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=387109", "title": "Fordism", "text": "Fordism\n\nFordism is the basis of modern economic and social systems in industrialized, standardized mass production and mass consumption. The concept is named for Henry Ford. It is used in social, economic, and management theory about production, working conditions, consumption, and related phenomena, especially regarding the 20th century.\n\nFordism is \"the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them.\" It has also been described as \"a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor.\" Although Fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles:\n\n\nThe principles, coupled with a technological revolution during Henry Ford's time, allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish. His assembly line was revolutionary though not original as it had previously been used at slaughterhouses. His most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones, with the help of specialised tools. Simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time. That allowed for a very adaptable flexibility, creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled. In reality, the assembly line had already been around before Ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create. His real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components, only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination, thereby producing an optimum method for the real world.\n\nThe major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, and it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production. There are four levels of Fordism, as described by Bob Jessop.\n\nThe Ford Motor Company was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between 1890 and 1910. After five years of producing automobiles, Ford introduced the Model T, which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the country's primitive roads. The mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price, making it affordable for the average consumer. Furthermore, Ford substantially increased his workers' wages to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover, which approached 400% annually, which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers. That led to massive consumption. In fact, the Model T surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of 60% of the automobile output within the United States.\n\nThe production system that Ford exemplified involved synchronization, precision, and specialization within a company.\n\nFord and his senior managers did not use the word \"Fordism\" themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an \"ism\". However, many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name Fordism to it.\n\nThe term gained prominence when it was used by Antonio Gramsci in 1934 in his essay \"Americanism and Fordism\" in his \"Prison Notebooks\". Since then, it has been used by a number of writers on economics and society, mainly but not exclusively in the Marxist tradition.\n\nAccording to historian Charles S. Maier, Fordism proper was preceded in Europe by Taylorism, a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization, based upon supposedly-scientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems. It attracted European intellectuals, especially in Germany and Italy, from the \"fin de siècle\" to World War I.\n\nAfter 1918, however, the goal of Taylorist labor efficiency thought in Europe moved to \"Fordism,\" the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line, standardization, and the mass market. The grand appeal of Fordism in Europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society, by subordinating the economy, society, and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality. The Great Depression blurred the utopian vision of American technocracy, but World War II and its aftermath revived the ideal.\n\nThe principles of Taylorism were quickly picked up by Vladimir Lenin and applied to the industrialization of the Soviet Union.\n\nLater, under the inspiration of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the Fordism concept in the 1930s and developed Post-Fordism in the 1970s. Antonio and Bonanno (2000) trace the development of Fordism and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized America's role in globalization. \"Fordism,\" for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that Fordism peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass consumerism but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the 1970s.\n\nAdvances in technology and the end of the Cold War ushered in a new \"neoliberal\" phase of globalization in the 1990s. Antonio and Bonanno further suggest that negative elements of Fordism, such as economic inequality, remained, allowing related cultural and environmental troubles, which inhibited America's pursuit of democracy to surface.\n\nHistorian Thomas Hughes has detailed how the Soviet Union, in the 1920s and the 1930s, enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism by importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the Five-Year Plan and the centrally-planned economy can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes Joseph Stalin:\n\nHughes describes how, as the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both the Soviets and the Americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of American ideas and expertise. The Soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals. Americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge, during the Cold War, their part in creating a powerful rival.\n\nFordism is a key concept in the theories of the Regulation school, often in contrast to post-Fordism, and the term is also used in Western Marxist thought.\n\nIn Regulation theory, it is a \"regime of accumulation\" or a macroeconomic pattern of growth, developed in the US and diffused in various forms to Western Europe after 1945. It consisted of domestic mass production with a range of institutions and policies supporting mass consumption, including stabilizing economic policies and Keynesian demand management that generated national demand and social stability; it also included a class compromise or social contract entailing family-supporting wages, job stability and internal labor markets leading broadly shared prosperity: rising incomes were linked to national productivity from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. At the level of the labor process Fordism is Taylorist and as a national mode of regulation Fordism is Keynesianism.\n\nThe social-scientific concept of \"Fordism\" was introduced by the French regulation school, sometimes known as regulation theory, which is a Marxist-influenced strand of political economy. According to the regulation school, capitalist production paradigms are born from the crisis of the previous paradigm; a newborn paradigm is also bound to fall into crisis sooner or later. The crisis of Fordism became apparent to Marxists in late 1960s.\n\nMarxist regulation theory talks of Regimes of Capital Accumulation (ROA) and Modes of Regulation (MOR). ROAs are periods of relatively settled economic growth and profit across a nation or global region. Such regimes eventually become exhausted, falling into crisis, and are torn down as capitalism seeks to remake itself and return to a period of profit. Such periods of capital accumulation are \"underpinned,\" or stabilised, by MOR. A plethora of laws, institutions, social mores, customs and hegemonies both national and international work together to create the environment for long-run capitalist profit.\n\nFordism is a tag used to characterise the post-1945 long boom experienced by western nations. It is typified by a cycle of mass production and mass consumption, the production of standardized (most often) consumer items to be sold in (typically) protected domestic markets, and the use of Keynesian economic policies. While the standard pattern is postwar America, national variations of this standard norm are well known. Regulation theory talks of National Modes of Growth to denote different varieties of Fordism across western economies.\n\nFordism as an ROA broke down, dependent on national experiences, somewhere between the late 1960s and the mid-1970s. Western economies experienced slow or nil economic growth, rising inflation and growing unemployment, much of this as a result of the 1973 oil shock.\n\nThe period after Fordism has been termed Post-Fordist and Neo-Fordist. The former implies that global capitalism has made a clean break from Fordism, including overcoming its inconsistencies, but the latter implies that elements of the Fordist ROA continued to exist. The Regulation School preferred the term After-Fordism (or the French \"Après-Fordisme\") to denote that what comes after Fordism was or is not clear.\n\nIn Post-Fordist economies:\n\nThe mass-produced robots in Karel Čapek's play \"R.U.R.\" have been described as representing \"the traumatic transformation of modern society by the First World War and the Fordist assembly line.\"\n\nA religion based on the worship of Henry Ford is a central feature of the technocracy in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\", where the principles of mass production are applied to the generation of people as well as to industry.\n\n\n\n"}

They were the youngest children of con artist William Avery \"Bill\" Rockefeller (1810–1906) and Eliza Davison (1813–1889). His two older brothers were Standard Oil co-founders John Davison Rockefeller (1839–1937) and William Avery Rockefeller Jr. (1841–1922).\n\nRockefeller's early years were spent in Richford, New York. With his father, he removed to Cleveland, Ohio, which would be the home base of his business endeavors.\n\nIn September 1861, while still underage, he joined the 7th Ohio Infantry and participated as an infantryman in the battles of Winchester, Port Republic, Cedar Mountain, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Lookout Mountain, and other battles including Sherman's march to Atlanta. He was wounded in the head by grape shot at Chancellorsville. \n\nHe held various jobs in Cleveland, eventually becoming involved in his brothers' Standard Oil Co. Frank became one of the principal promoters of the company, and later served as its Vice President. However, Rockefeller fell out with his brothers and left Standard Oil in 1898. The rift was caused by John D. not taking consideration of Frank's other interests in the Pioneer Oil Company, and quarrels with Frank's partner, James Corrigan, with whom he owned the Franklin Mine near Lake Superior. He moved with his family to a large ranch in Kansas, but he later returned to Ohio. The 8,000-acre ranch stood on a large tract of cheap land in Belvidere, Kansas, west of Wichita (originally spotted by his father on his travels). The property was remote from railroads, and his cattle could graze on vast, unfenced plains. Eventually the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad brought in fresh settlers shrinking the free range for cattlemen. This ruined the ranch for breeding beef, and Frank tried futilely to sell the depreciated property.\n\nFrank formed a business relationship with Feargus B. Squire and Herman Frasch, acquiring a three-tenths interest in the Frasch Process. All three then entered into a 50-50 agreement with the American Sulphur Company to form the Union Sulphur Company.\n\nFrank was not as suited to business as his brothers. He invested around $500,000 in mining ventures, which proved unsound, and also invested $250,000 in unfruitful commercial paper. Frank found stability when he invested in the Buckeye Steel Castings Company of Columbus in 1892. He became President of the company in 1905, and served in that capacity until 1908, when the Presidency was assumed by Samuel Prescott Bush. Frank Rockefeller continued as Vice President of the company.\n\nFrank Rockefeller refused to speak to his brothers John and William Jr. until his death, despite William attempting reconciliation in the summer of 1916. Frank said later that year \"There's not the slightest possibility of a reconciliation.\" Frank died the following year. His funeral was held on April 17, 1917 at the home of Mrs. Walter S. Bowler. The funeral was attended by his brothers, John and William, the former being described in the press as \"looking tired and careworn.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1567681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1567681", "title": "Froth flotation", "text": "Froth flotation\n\nFroth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. This is used in mineral processing, paper recycling and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century. It has been described as \"the single most important operation used for the recovery and upgrading of sulfide ores\". The development of froth flotation has improved the recovery of valuable minerals, such as copper- and lead-bearing minerals. Along with mechanized mining, it has allowed the economic recovery of valuable metals from much lower grade ore than previously.\n\nDescriptions of the use of a flotation process have been found in ancient Greek and Persian literature suggesting its antiquity. During the late nineteenth century, the process basics were discovered through a slow evolutionary phase; then, during the first decade of the twentieth century, a more rapid investigation of oils, froths, and agitation led to proven work-place applications, especially at Broken Hill, Australia, that brought the technological innovation known as “froth flotation.” During the early twentieth century, it truly and dramatically revolutionized -- an overworked term, but accurate here -- mineral processing around the globe.\n\nInitially, naturally occurring chemicals such as fatty acids and oils were used as flotation reagents in a large quantity to increase the hydrophobicity of the valuable minerals. Since then, the process has been adapted and applied to a wide variety of materials to be separated, and additional collector agents, including surfactants and synthetic compounds have been adopted for various applications.\n\nEnglishman William Haynes patented a process in 1860 for separating sulfide and gangue minerals using oil. Later writers have pointed to Haynes's as the first \"bulk oil flotation\" patent, though there is no evidence of its ever being field tested, let alone used commercially. While in 1877 the brothers Bessel (Adolph and August) of Dresden, Germany, introduced their commercially successful oil and froth flotation process for extracting graphite, considered by some the root of froth flotation. However, because the Bessel process was used on graphite not gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, etc, their work has been ignored by most historians of the technology. Seventy-seven year old inventor Hezekiah Bradford of Philadelphia imitated their work and patented a similar process in 1885. He had received his first patent in 1834, primarily invented machinery to separate slate from coal during the 1850s-1860s, and perfected the Bradford Breaker, still in use by the coal industry today, but it is uncertain if his 1885 patented \"flotation\" process was successfully introduced in the graphite deposits in nearby Chester County, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1885 Carrie Everson patented a process calling for oil[s] but also an acid or a salt, a significant step in the evolution of the process history. By 1890, tests of the Everson process had been made at Georgetown and Silver Cliff, Colorado, and Baker, Oregon. She abandoned the work with the death of her husband, and before perfecting a commercial successful process. Later, during the height of legal disputes over the validity or not of various patents during the 1910s, Everson's was often pointed to as the initial flotation patent -- which would have meant that the process was not patentable again by later contestants. Much confusion has been clarified recently by historian Dawn Bunyak.\n\nThe generally recognized first successful commercial flotation process for \"mineral\" sulphides was invented by Frank Elmore who worked on the development with his brother, Stanley. The Glasdir copper mine at Llanelltyd, near Dolgellau in North Wales was bought in 1896 by the Elmore brothers in conjunction with their father, William. In 1897, the Elmore brothers installed the world's first industrial size commercial flotation process for mineral beneficiation at the Glasdir mine. The process was not froth flotation but used oil to agglomerate (make balls of) pulverised sulphides and buoy them to the surface, and was patented in 1898 with a description of the process published in 1903 in the \"Engineering and Mining Journal\". By this time they had recognized the importance of air bubbles in assisting the oil to carry away the mineral particles. The Elmores had formed a company known as the Ore Concentration Syndicate Ltd to promote the commercial use of the process worldwide. Charles Butters of Berkeley, California, acquired American rights to Elmores' process, and developed what was known to contemporaries as the \"Butters Process\". Butters, an expert on the cyanide process, tried lab test of the Elmore process on gold ores without success. \n\nHowever developments elsewhere, particularly in Broken Hill, Australia by Minerals Separation, Limited, led to decades of hard fought legal battles and litigations which, ultimately, were lost as the Elmore process was superseded by more advanced techniques. Another flotation process was independently invented in the early 1900s in Australia by Charles Vincent Potter and around the same time by Guillaume Daniel Delprat.\n\nYet another process was developed in 1902 by Cattermole, who emulsified the pulp with a small quantity of oil, subjected it to violent agitation, then slow stirring which coagulated the target minerals into nodules which were separated from the pulp by gravity. The Minerals Separation Ltd., formed in Britain in 1903 to acquire the Cattermole patent, found that it proved unsuccessful. Metallurgists on the staff continued to test and combine other discoveries to patent in 1905 their process, called the Sulman-Picard-Ballot process after company officers and patentees. The process proved successful at their Central Block plant, Broken Hill that year. Significant in their \"agitation froth flotation\" process was the use of less than 1% oil and an agitation step that created small bubbles, which provided more surface to capture the metal and float into to a froth at the surface.\n\nMineral Separation also bought other patents to consolidate ownership of any potential conflicting rights to the flotation process--except for the Elmore patents. In 1910, when the Zinc Corporation replaced its Elmore process with the Minerals Separation (Sulman-Picard-Ballot) froth flotation process at its Broken Hill plant, the primacy of the Minerals Separation over other process contenders was assured. Henry Livingston Sulman was later recognized by his peers in his election as President of the British Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, which also awarded him its gold medal. \n\nDevelopments in the United States had been less than spectacular. Butters's failures, as well as others, was followed after 1904, with Scotsman Stanley MacQuisten's process (a surface tension based method), which was developed with a modicum of success in Nevada and Idaho, but this would not work when slimes were present, a major fault. Henry E. Wood of Denver had developed his flotation process along the same lines in 1907, patented 1911, with some success on molybdenum ores. For the most part, however, these were isolated attempts without fanfare for what can only be called marginal successes. \n\nIn 1911, James M. Hyde, a former employee of Minerals Separation, Ltd., modified the Minerals Separation process and installed a test plant in the Butte and Superior Mill in Basin, Montana, the first such installation in the USA. In 1912, he designed the Butte & Superior zinc works, Butte, Montana, the first great flotation plant in America. Minerals Separation, Ltd., which had set up an office in San Francisco, sued Hyde for infringement as well as the Butte & Superior company, both cases were eventually won by the firm in the U. S. Supreme Court. Daniel Cowan Jackling and partners, who controlled Butte & Superior, also refuted the Minerals Separation patent and funded the ensuing legal battles that lasted over a decade. They -- Utah Copper (Kennecott), Nevada Consolidated, Chino Copper, Ray Con and other Jackling firms -- eventually settled, in 1922, paying a substantial fee for licenses to use the Minerals Separation process. One unfortunate result of the dispute was professional divisiveness among the mining engineering community for a generation.\n\nIn 1913, the Minerals Separation paid for a test plant for the Inspiration Copper Company at Miami, Arizona. Built under the San Francisco office director, Edward Nutter, it proved a success. Inspiration engineer L. D. Ricketts ripped out a gravity concentration mill and replaced it with the Minerals Separation process, the first major use of the process at an American copper mine. A major holder of Inspiration stock were men who controlled the great Anaconda mine of Butte. They immediately followed the Inspiration success to build a Minerals Separation licensed plant at Butte, in 1915-1916, a major statement about the final acceptance of the Minerals Separation patented process. \n\nJohn M. Callow, of General Engineering of Salt Lake City, had followed flotation from technical papers and the introduction in both the Butte and Superior Mill, and at Inspiration Copper in Arizona and determined that mechanical agitation was a drawback to the existing technology. Introducing a porous brick with compressed air, and a mechanical stirring mechanism, Callow applied for a patent in 1914 (some say that Callow, a Jackling partisan, invented his cell as a means to avoid paying royalties to Minerals Separation, which firms using his cell eventually were forced to do by the courts). This method, known as Pneumatic Flotation, was recognized as an alternative to the Minerals Separation process of flotation concentration. The American Institute of Mining Engineers presented Callow the James Douglas Gold Medal in 1926 for his contributions to the field of flotation. By that time, flotation technology was changing, especially with the discovery of the use of xanthates and other reagents, which made the Callow cell and his process obsolete.\n\nMontana Tech professor Antoine Marc Gaudin defined the early period of flotation as the mechanical phase while by the late 1910s it entered the chemical phase. Discoveries in reagents, especially the use of xanthates patented by Minerals Separations chemist Cornelius H. Keller, not so much increased the capture of minerals through the process as making it far more manageable in day to day operations. Minerals Separation's initial flotation patents ended 1923, and new ones for chemical processes gave it a significant position into the 1930s. During this period the company also developed and patented flotation processes for iron out of its Hibbing lab and of phosphate in its Florida lab. Another rapid phase of flotation process innovation did not occur until after 1960.\n\nIn the 1960s the froth flotation technique was adapted for deinking recycled paper.\n\nThe success of the process is evinced by the number of claimants as \"discoverers\" of flotation. In 1961, American engineers celebrated \"50 years of flotation\" and enshrined James Hyde and his Butte & Superior mill. In 1977, German engineers celebrated the \"hundredth anniversary of flotation\" based on the brothers Bessel patent of 1877. The historic Glasdir copper mine site advertises its tours in Wales as site of the \"discovery of flotation\" based upon the Elmore brothers work. Recent writers, because of the interest in celebrating women in science, champion Carrie Everson of Denver as mother of the process based on her 1885 patent. Omitted from this list are the engineers, metallurgists and chemists of Minerals Separation, Ltd., which, at least in the American and Australian courts, won control of froth flotation patents as well as right of claimant as discoverers of froth flotation. But, as historian Martin Lynch writes, \"Mineral Separation would eventually prevail after taking the case to the US Supreme Court [and the House of Lords], and in so doing earned for itself the cordial detestation of many in the mining world.\"\n\nFroth flotation is a process for separating minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their hydrophobicity. Hydrophobicity differences between valuable minerals and waste gangue are increased through the use of surfactants and wetting agents. The selective separation of the minerals makes processing complex (that is, mixed) ores economically feasible. The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of sulfides, carbonates and oxides prior to further refinement. Phosphates and coal are also upgraded (purified) by flotation technology.\n\nPrior to 1907, nearly all the copper mined in the US came from underground vein deposits, averaging 2.5 percent copper. By 1991, the average grade of copper ore mined in the US had fallen to only 0.6 percent.\n\nThe flotation process is also widely used in industrial waste water treatment plants, where it removes fats, oil, grease and suspended solids from waste water. These units are called dissolved air flotation (DAF) units. In particular, dissolved air flotation units are used in removing oil from the wastewater effluents of oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical plants, natural gas processing plants and similar industrial facilities.\n\nFroth flotation is one of the processes used to recover recycled paper. In the paper industry this step is called deinking or just flotation. The target is to release and remove the hydrophobic contaminants from the recycled paper. The contaminants are mostly printing ink and stickies. Normally the setup is a two-stage system with 3,4 or 5 flotation cells in series.\n\nBefore froth flotation can work, the ore to be treated is reduced to fine particles by crushing and grinding (a process known as comminution) so that the various minerals exist as physically separate grains. This process is known as \"liberation\". The particle sizes are typically less than 0.1 mm (100 µm), but sometimes sizes smaller than 7–10 µm are required. There is a tendency for the liberation size of the minerals to decrease over time as the ore bodies with coarse mineral grains that can be separated at larger sizes are depleted and replaced by ore bodies that were formerly considered too difficult.\n\nIn the mining industry, the plants where flotation is undertaken to concentrate ore are generally known as \"concentrators\" or \"mills\".\n\nFor froth flotation, the ground ore is mixed with water to form a slurry and the desired mineral is rendered hydrophobic by the addition of a surfactant or \"collector\" chemical (although some mineral surfaces are naturally hydrophobic, requiring little or no addition of collector). The particular chemical depends on the nature of the mineral to be recovered and, perhaps, the natures of those that are not wanted. As an example, sodium ethyl xanthate may be added as a collector in the selective flotation of galena (lead sulfide) to separate it from sphalerite (zinc sulfide). This slurry (more properly called the \"pulp\") of hydrophobic particles and hydrophilic particles is then introduced to tanks known as \"flotation cells\" that are aerated to produce bubbles. The hydrophobic particles attach to the air bubbles, which rise to the surface, forming a froth. The froth is removed from the cell, producing a concentrate (\"con\") of the target mineral.\n\nFrothing agents, known as \"frothers\", may be introduced to the pulp to promote the formation of a stable froth on top of the flotation cell.\n\nThe minerals that do not float into the froth are referred to as the \"flotation tailings\" or \"flotation tails\". These tailings may also be subjected to further stages of flotation to recover the valuable particles that did not float the first time. This is known as \"scavenging\". The final tailings after scavenging are normally pumped for disposal as mine fill or to tailings disposal facilities for long-term storage.\n\nFroth flotation efficiency is determined by a series of probabilities: those of particle–bubble contact, particle–bubble attachment, transport between the pulp and the froth, and froth collection into the product launder. In a conventional mechanically-agitated cell, the void fraction (i.e. volume occupied by air bubbles) is low (5 to 10 percent) and the bubble size is usually greater than 1 mm. This results in a relatively low interfacial area and a low probability of particle–bubble contact. Consequently, several cells in series are required to increase the particle residence time, thus increasing the probability of particle–bubble contact.\n\nFlotation is normally undertaken in several stages to maximize the recovery of the target mineral or minerals and the concentration of those minerals in the concentrate, while minimizing the energy input.\n\nThe first stage is called \"roughing\", which produces a \"rougher concentrate\". The objective is to remove the maximum amount of the valuable mineral at as coarse a particle size as practical. The finer an ore is ground, the greater the energy that is required, so it makes sense to fine grind only those particles that need fine grinding. Complete liberation is not required for rougher flotation, only sufficient liberation to release enough gangue from the valuable mineral to get a high recovery.\n\nThe primary objective of roughing is to recover as much of the valuable minerals as possible, with less emphasis on the quality of the concentrate produced.\n\nIn some concentrators, there may be a \"preflotation\" step that precedes roughing. This is done when there are some undesirable materials, such as organic carbon, that readily float. They are removed first to avoid them floating during roughing (and thus contaminating the rougher concentrate).\n\nThe rougher concentrate is normally subjected to further stages of flotation to reject more of the undesirable minerals that also reported to the froth, in a process known as \"cleaning\". The product of cleaning is known as the \"cleaner concentrate\" or the \"final concentrate\".\n\nThe objective of cleaning is to produce as high a concentrate grade as possible.\n\nThe rougher concentrate is often subject to further grinding (usually called \"regrinding\") to get more complete liberation of the valuable minerals. Because it is a smaller mass than that of the original ore, less energy is needed than would be necessary if the whole ore were reground. Regrinding is often undertaken in specialized \"regrind mills\", such as the IsaMill, designed to further reduce the energy consumed during regrinding to finer sizes.\n\nThe rougher flotation step is often followed by a \"scavenger\" flotation step that is applied to the rougher tailings. The objective is to recover any of the target minerals that were not recovered during the initial roughing stage. This might be achieved by changing the flotation conditions to make them more rigorous than the initial roughing, or there might be some secondary grinding to provide further liberation.\n\nThe concentrate from the rougher scavengers could be returned to the rougher feed for refloating or sent to special cleaner cells.\n\nSimilarly, the cleaning step may also be followed by a scavenging step performed on the cleaner tailings.\n\nTo be effective on a given ore slurry, the collectors are chosen based upon their selective wetting of the types of particles to be separated. A good collector will adsorb, physically or chemically, with one of the types of particles. This provides the thermodynamic requirement for the particles to bind to the surface of a bubble. The wetting activity of a surfactant on a particle can be quantified by measuring the contact angles that the liquid/bubble interface makes with it. Another important measure for attachment of bubbles to particles is induction time. The induction time is the time required for the particle and bubble to rupture the thin film separating the particle and bubble. This rupturing is achieved by the surface forces between the particle and bubble.\n\nThe mechanisms for the bubble-particle attachment is very complex and consists of three steps, collision, attachment and detachment. The collision is achieved by particles being within the collision tube of a bubble and this is affected by the velocity of the bubble and radius of the bubble. The collision tube corresponds to the region in which a particle will collide with the bubble, with the perimeter of the collision tube corresponding to the grazing trajectory.\n\nThe attachment of the particle to the bubble is controlled by the induction time of the particle and bubble. The particle and bubble need to bind and this occurs if the time in which the particle and bubble are in contact with each other is larger than the required induction time. This induction time is affected by the fluid viscosity, particle and bubble size and the forces between the particle and bubbles.\n\nThe detachment of a particle and bubble occurs when the force exerted by the surface tension is exceeded by shear forces and gravitational forces. These forces are complex and vary within the cell. High shear will be experienced close to the impeller of a mechanical flotation cell and mostly gravitational force in the collection and cleaning zone of a flotation column.\n\nSignificant issues of entrainment of fine particles occurs as these particles experience low collision efficiencies as well as sliming and degradation of the particle surfaces. Coarse particles show a low recovery of the valuable mineral due to the low liberation and high detachment efficiencies.\n\nFroth flotation depends on the selective adhesion of air bubbles to mineral surfaces in a mineral/water slurry. The air bubbles will attach to more hydrophobic particles. The attachment of the bubbles to the surface is determined by the interfacial energies between the solid, liquid, and gas phases. This is determined by the Young-Dupré Equation:\nformula_1\n\nwhere:\n\nMinerals targeted for separation may be chemically surface-modified with collectors so that they are more hydrophobic. Collectors are a type of surfactant that increase the natural hydrophobicity of the surface, increasing the separability of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. Collectors either chemically bond via chemisorption to the mineral or adsorb onto the surface via physisorption.\n\nThe collision rates for fine particles (50 - 80 μm) can be accurately modeled, but there is no current theory that accurately models bubble-particle collision for particles as large as 300 μm, which are commonly used in flotation processes.\n\nFor fine particles, Stokes law underestimates collision probability while the potential equation based on surface charge overestimates collision probability so an intermediate equation is used.\n\nIt is important to know the collision rates in the system since this step precedes the adsorption where a three phase system is formed.\n\nThe effectiveness of a medium to adsorb to a particle is influenced by the relationship between the surfaces of both materials. There are multiple factors that affect the efficiency of adsorption in chemical, thermodynamic, and physical domains. These factors can range from surface energy and polarity to the shape, size, and roughness of the particle. In froth flotation, adsorption is a strong consequence of surface energy, since the small particles have a high surface area to size ratio, resulting in higher energy surfaces to form attractions with adsorbates. The air bubbles must selectively adhere to the desired minerals to elevate them to the surface of the slurry while wetting the other minerals and leaving them in the aqueous slurry medium.\n\nParticles that can be easily wetted by water are called hydrophilic, while particles that are not easily wetted by water are called hydrophobic. Hydrophobic particles have a tendency to form a separate phase in aqueous media. In froth flotation the effectiveness of an air bubble to adhere to a particle is based on how hydrophobic the particle is. Hydrophobic particles have an affinity to air bubbles, leading to adsorption. The bubble-particle combinations are elevated to the froth zone driven by buoyancy forces.\n\nThe attachment of the bubbles to the particles is determined by the interfacial energies of between the solid, liquid, and vapor phases, as modeled by the Young/Dupre Equation. The interfacial energies can be based on the natural structure of the materials, or the addition of chemical treatments can improve energy compatibility.\n\nCollectors are the main additives used to improve particle surfaces. They function as surfactants to selectively isolate and aid adsorption between the particles of interest and bubbles rising through the slurry. Common collectors used in flotation are anionic sulfur ligands, which have a bifunctional structure with an ionic portion which shares attraction with metals, and a hydrophobic portion such as a long hydrocarbon tail. These collectors coat a particle’s surface with a monolayer of non-polar substance to aid separation from the aqueous phase by decreasing the adsorbed particle solubility in water. The adsorbed ligands can form micelles around the particles and form small-particle colloids improving stability and phase separation further.\n\nThe adsorption of particles to bubbles is essential to separating the minerals from the slurry, but the minerals must be purified from the additives used in separation, such as the collectors, frothers, and modifiers. The product of the cleaning, or desorption process, is known as the cleaner concentrate. \nThe detachment of a particle and bubble requires adsorption bond cleavage driven by shear forces. Depending on the flotation cell type, shear forces are applied by a variety of mechanical systems. Among the most common are impellers and mixers. Some systems combine the functionalities of these components by placing them at key locations where they can take part in multiple froth flotation mechanisms. Cleaning cells also take advantage of gravitational forces to improve separation efficiency.\n\nA common quantity used to describe the collection efficiency of a froth flotation process is \"flotation recovery\" (formula_2). This quantity incorporates the probabilities of collision and attachment of particles to gas flotation bubbles.\n\nformula_3\n\nwhere:\n\nThe following, are several additional mathematical methods often used to evaluate the effectiveness of froth flotation processes. These equations are more simple than the calculation for \"flotation recovery\", as they are based solely on the amounts of inputs and outputs of the processes.\n\nFor the following equations:\n\nRatio of feed weight to concentrate weight formula_17 (unitless)\n\nformula_18\n\nPercent of metal recovered (formula_19) in wt\"%\"\n\nformula_20\n\nPercent of metal lost (formula_21) in wt\"%\"\n\nformula_22\n\nPercent of weight recovered formula_23 in wt\"%\"\n\nformula_24\n\nGrade-recovery curves are useful tools in weighing the trade-off of producing a high grade of concentrate while maintaining as low of a recovery rate as possible, two important aspects of froth flotation. These curves are developed empirically based on the individual froth flotation process of a particular plant. As the curves are shifted in the positive x-direction (to the right) and the positive y-direction (upward) the performance of the froth flotation process is regarded as improving. A disadvantage to these curves is that they can only compare the grade-recovery relations of a specific feed grade and feed rate. If a company has a variance of feed grades and rates used (an extremely common occurrence) in their froth flotation process, grade-recovery curves for every pairing of feed grade and recovery rate would have to be constructed in order to provide meaningful information to the plant.\n\nFlotation can be performed in rectangular or cylindrical mechanically agitated cells or tanks, flotation columns, Jameson Cells or deinking flotation machines. Classified by the method of air absorption manner, it is fair to state that two distinct groups of flotation equipments have arisen:pneumatic and mechanical machines. Generally pneumatic machines give a low-grade concentrate and little operating troubles.\nMechanical cells use a large mixer and diffuser mechanism at the bottom of the mixing tank to introduce air and provide mixing action. Flotation columns use air spargers to introduce air at the bottom of a tall column while introducing slurry above. The countercurrent motion of the slurry flowing down and the air flowing up provides mixing action. Mechanical cells generally have a higher throughput rate, but produce material that is of lower quality, while flotation columns generally have a low throughput rate but produce higher quality material.\n\nThe Jameson cell uses neither impellers nor spargers, instead combining the slurry with air in a downcomer where high shear creates the turbulent conditions required for bubble particle contacting.\n\nThe following steps are followed, following grinding to liberate the mineral particles:\n\nSimple flotation circuit for mineral concentration. Numbered triangles show direction of stream flow. Various flotation reagents are added to a mixture of ore and water (called pulp) in a conditioning tank. The flow rate and tank size are designed to give the minerals enough time to be activated. The conditioner pulp [1] is fed to a bank of rougher cells which remove most of the desired minerals as a concentrate. The rougher pulp [2] passes to a bank of scavenger cells where additional reagents may be added. The scavenger cell froth [3] is usually returned to the rougher cells for additional treatment, but in some cases may be sent to special cleaner cells. The scavenger pulp is usually barren enough to be discarded as tails. More complex flotation circuits have several sets of cleaner and re-cleaner cells, and intermediate re-grinding of pulp or concentrate.\n\nFor many ores (e.g. those of Cu, Mo, W, Ni), the collectors are anionic sulfur ligands. Particularly popular are xanthate salts, including potassium amyl xanthate (PAX), potassium isobutyl xanthate (PIBX), potassium ethyl xanthate (KEX), sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX), sodium isopropyl xanthate (SIPX), sodium ethyl xanthate (SEX). Other collectors include related sulfur-based ligands: dithiophosphates, dithiocarbamates. Still other classes of collectors include the thiourea thiocarbanilide. Fatty acids have also been used.\n\nFor some minerals (e.g., sylvanite for KCl), fatty amines are used as collectors.\n\nA variety of compounds are added to stabilize the foams. These additives include pine oil, various alcohols (methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC)), polyglycols, xylenol (cresylic acid).\n\nA variety of other compounds are added to optimize the separation process, these additives are called modifiers. Such species do not interact directly with the mineral, but modify the physical properties of the solution.\n\n\n\nIllustrative, the flotation process is used for purification of potassium chloride from sodium chloride and clay minerals. The crushed mineral is suspended in brine in the presence of fatty ammonium salts. Because the ammonium group and K have very similar ionic radii (ca. 0.135, 0.143 nm respectively), the ammonium centers exchange for the surface potassium sites on the particles of KCl, but not on the NaCl particles. The long alkyl chains then confer hydrophobicity, to the particles, which enable them to form foams.\n\n\n"}

He was the first Jew and businessman to be executed by the Islamic government.\n\nElghanian has six brothers, Aghadjan, Davoud, Nourollah (father of Henry Elghanayan), Sion, Ataollah and Nedjatollah. In 1959, Elghanian established Plasco, a plastics manufacturing factory in Tehran which later became the largest and most technologically advanced plastics manufacturer in Iran. He played a significant role in bringing Western technology to Iran in the 1960s and 1970s. A self made multi-millionaire, Elghanian was known for his entrepreneurial accomplishments in Iran and Israel. In addition, he served as the leader of the society in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nShortly after the Islamic revolution in 1979, Elghanian was arrested on March 16 after returning to Iran, and accused of spying. The charges included corruption, contacts with Israel and Zionism, and \"economic imperialism\". On May 8, he was tried and convicted of a number of crimes, including meeting with Israeli leaders. According to his granddaughter, the trial lasted less than twenty minutes. He was sentenced to death, with his execution carried out before dawn the next day. All of the property belonging to the Elghanian family in Iran was confiscated by the state. A report by \"Time\" magazine states: Elghanian, who was convicted of spying for Israel, was said to have made huge investments in Israel and to have solicited funds for the Israeli army, which the prosecution claimed made him an accomplice \"in murderous air raids against innocent Palestinians.\" Elghanian stated that he was not a supporter of Zionism, though his Plasco Building was built by Israeli engineers during the Shah Era when Iran had close relations with Israel, and he had made investments in Israel.\n\nOn 9 May 1979, Elghanian was executed by firing squad in Tehran. He was the first Jewish citizen and one of the first civilians of Iran to be executed by the new Islamic government.\n\nHis death was considered one of the reasons for the departure of 75% of the 80,000 Jews who lived in the country before the revolution.\n\nAmid the post-revolution chaos, the government with its many rival factions initially refused to release Elghanian's body to his family for burial. With the intervention of Chief Rabbi Yedidia Shofet and other prominent members of the Tehran Jewish community, his body was finally released and initially buried in an unmarked grave in Tehran's Beheshtieh Jewish Cemetery. Out of fear of further retaliation, only a handful of people attended Elghanian's burial. A modest tombstone was later placed on his grave making no reference to his execution.\n\nShortly after Elghanian's execution, the United States Senate passed a resolution authored by New York Senator Jacob Javits to condemn his execution as well as that of other civilians as a violation of human rights in Iran.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Stuxnet worm that attacked Iran's nuclear facilities, there was speculation by security researchers working for Symantec that a number found in the Stuxnet code - \"19790509\" - which was used as a marker to identify computers that should not be affected, was a reference to his execution date; however, researchers also warned against using this possible connection to draw any conclusions as to Stuxnet's origin.\n\nOn January 19, 2017, the 17-storey Plasco Building in downtown Tehran collapsed live on TV after a fire engulfed its top floors.

This phase was known by Sombart as \"Early Capitalism\" In 1933, Benito Mussolini claimed that capitalism began with dynamic or heroic capitalism (1830-1870) followed by static capitalism (1870-1914) and then reached its final form of decadent capitalism, known also as supercapitalism, which began in 1914. \n\nMussolini argued that although he did not support this type of capitalism he considered it at least a dynamic and heroic form. Some Fascists, including Mussolini, considered it a contribution to the industrialism and technical developments but claimed that they did not favour the creation of supercapitalism in Italy, due to its strong agricultural sector.\n\nMussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism inevitably degenerates into static capitalism and then supercapitalism due to the concepts of bourgeois economic individualism, and instead he proposed a state supervised economy, although he contrasted it to Russian \"State Supercapitalism\". Italian Fascism presented the economic system of corporatism as the solution that would preserve private initiatives and property while allowing the state and the syndicalist movement to intervene in the economy in the matters where private initiative intervenes in public affairs.

Rose is also the founder of Gramavision Records, a jazz and new music label. He is the author of \"The Well Tempered City: What Modern Science, Ancient Civilizations and Human Behavior Teach Us About the Future of Urban Life\".\n\nRose was born to a Jewish family living in Harrison, New York and raised in Scarsdale, New York, the son of Sandra (née Priest) and Frederick P. Rose. His grandfather, Samuel B. Rose, and great-uncle, David Rose, founded the real estate development company Rose Associates in 1928 and built small apartment buildings in the Bronx and then in Manhattan in the 1930s. His father, Frederick P. Rose, who later served as the chairman of Rose Associates, expanded the company with his two brothers, Daniel and Elihu. Rose attended the Horace Mann School and graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy in 1974. In 1980, Rose earned a Masters in Regional Planning from the University of Pennsylvania in a program lead by Ian McHarg.\n\nAfter graduate school, Rose joined his family's real estate company, Rose Associates, in 1976 to learn the practice of development. In 1979-80, he developed the American Thread Building, the first live/work residential community to include computers and internet access in every home. When New York City's Mayor Koch called for assistance in developing affordable housing, Rose Associates obtained development rights for the area around the Atlantic Terminal. Rose was named project developer. In 1984, Rose over saw the design and approvals of the project, Atlantic Center, conceived of as one of the first large scale green mixed-use, mixed-income communities, with moderate-income housing units that were to be built under the New York City Partnership New Homes program. Prior to the start of construction, the project was later sold to Bruce Ratner's firm, Forest City/Ratner.\n\nIn 1979, Rose founded Gramavision Records, now a subsidiary of Rykodisc, producing over 75 jazz and new music recordings of artists including Taj Mahal, the Kronos Quartet, and John Scofield.

The firm's planning work is focused on increasing opportunity for lower income families and addressing environmental issues. As project managers, the firm works with cities and not-for-profits to realize projects such as Signature Theater on 42nd St. in New York City, The Orchestra of St Luke's DiMenna Center for Classical Music, The Irish Arts Center, and the redevelopment of the New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering campus in Brooklyn.

In 2017, Rose's firm purchased Forest City's national federally subsidized affordable housing portfolio, as well as its affordable housing property management group and its FHA Mortgage operation.\n\nRose is the author of \"The Well-Tempered City: What Modern Science, Ancient Civilizations, and Human Nature Teach Us About the Future of Urban Life,\" published by Harper Wave in September 2016 to mixed reviews. Rose proposes that in order to \"harmonize\" cities Rose proposes a methodology built on five qualities: coherence, circularity, resilience, community, and compassion. Siddhartha Mukherjee commented that \"...this provocative, important, and majestically composed book about the future of cities should be essential reading for our times.\" The review in the Stanford Social Innovation Review found that the book \"overlooks organic and spontaneous responses to urban issues\" and offered limited practical advice. The book received a PROSE Award for 'Outstanding Scholarly Work by a Trade Publisher' in 2017.\n\nIn 1977, Rose joined The Educational Alliance board, and served as the head of its real estate committee, overseeing the development of senior, homeless and affordable housing, drug treatment centers, and social services.

Generally speaking, the remuneration (money, goods, or services handed over) is negotiated ahead of time. The kickback varies from other kinds of bribes in that there is implied collusion between agents of the two parties, rather than one party extorting the bribe from the other. The purpose of the kickback is usually to encourage the other party to cooperate in the illegal scheme.\n\nThe term \"kickback\" comes from colloquial English language, and describes the way a recipient of illegal gain \"kicks back\" a portion of it to another person for that person's assistance in obtaining it.\n\nThe most common form of kickback involves a vendor submitting a fraudulent or inflated invoice (often for goods or services which were not needed, of inferior quality, or both), with an employee of the victim company assisting in securing payment. For his or her assistance in securing payment, the individual receives some sort of payment (cash, goods, services) or favor (the hiring of a relative, employment, etc.).\n\n\"Kickback brokers\" are individuals who may not receive the kickback personally, but who help link the individual or company providing the goods or services with individuals capable of assisting with the illegal payments. For helping to link the two colluding parties, either or both parties may make a payment to this \"broker\".\n\nKickbacks are one of the most common forms of government corruption. In some cases, the kickback takes the form of a \"cut of the action,\" and can be so well known as to be common knowledge—and even become part of a nation's culture. For example, in Indonesia, President Suharto was publicly known as \"Mr. Twenty-Five Percent\" because he required that all major contracts throughout the nation provide him with 25 percent of the income before he would approve the contract. And, in Pakistan, President Asif Ali Zardari was publicly known as \"Mr. Ten Percent\" for the same reason, which later became hundred percent. After coming into the government, he started taking 10% of all major contract investments before he would approve the contract. However, kickbacks differ from other forms of corruption, such as diversion of assets, as in embezzlement, because of the collusion between two parties.\n\nKickback schemes can be pervasive. For example, in the United States, companies providing medical services to Medicare patients were paying doctors to send patients to them, whether the patient needed the treatment, diagnosis, or test or not. In 1987, the United States Congress passed the stringent Anti-Kickback Act to prevent such schemes.\n\nIn Italy, the political scene was realigned dramatically by the \"Tangentopoli\" scandals in the 1990s, which uncovered widespread use of kickbacks in the national and local governments.\n\n"}

Unlike other predictive models which predominantly rely on a firm's current strategy and capabilities to determine future strategy, Porter's model additionally calls for an understanding of what motivates the competitor. This added dimension of understanding a competitor's internal culture, value system, mindset, and assumptions helps in determining a much more accurate and realistic reading of a competitor's possible reactions in a given situation.\n\nThis helps in determining competitor's action by understanding their goals (both strategic and tactical) and their current position vis-à-vis their goals. A wide gap between the two could mean the competitor is highly likely to react to any external threat that comes in its way, whereas a narrower gap is likely to produce a defensive strategy. \nThe question to be answered here is: What is it that drives the competitor? These drivers can be at various levels and dimensions and can provide insights into future goals.\nThe perceptions and assumptions the competitor has about itself and its industry would shape strategy. This corner includes determining the competitor's perception of its strengths and weaknesses, organization culture and their beliefs about competitor's goals. If the competitor thinks highly of its competition and has a fair sense of industry forces, it is likely to be ready with plans to counter any threats to its position. On the other hand, a competitor who has a misplaced understanding of industry forces is not very likely to respond to a potential attack.\nThe question to be answered here is: What are competitor's assumption about the industry, the competition and its own capabilities?\nA competitor's strategy determines how it competes in the market. However, there could be a difference between the company's intended strategy (as stated in the annual report and interviews) and its realized strategy (as is evident in its acquisitions, new product development, etc.). \nIt is therefore important here to determine the competitor's realized strategy and how they are actually performing. If current strategy is yielding satisfactory results, it is safe to assume that the competitor is likely to continue to operate in the same way.\nThe questions to be answered here are: What is the competitor actually doing and how successful is it in implementing its current strategy? \n\nThis looks at a competitor's inherent ability to initiate or respond to external forces. Though it might have the motivation and the drive to initiate a strategic action, its effectiveness is dependent on its capabilities. \nIts strengths will also determine how the competitor is likely to respond to an external threat. An organization with an extensive distribution network is likely to initiate an attack through its channel, whereas a company with strong financials is likely to counter attack through price drops.\nThe questions to be answered here are: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the competitor? Which areas is the competitor strong in?\n\nFirms are more often than not aware of their rivals and do have a generally good understanding of their strategies and capabilities. However, motivational factors are often overlooked. Sufficiently motivated competitors can often prove to be more competitive than bigger but less motivated rivals. What sets this model apart from others is its insistence on accounting for the \"implicit\" factors such as culture, history, executive, consultants, and board's backgrounds, goals, values and commitments and inclusion of management's deep beliefs and assumptions about what works or does not work in the market. \n\nPorter's four corners model provides a framework that ties competitor's capabilities to their assumptions of the competitive environment and their underlying motivations. Looking at both a firm's capabilities (what the firm can do) and underlying implicit factors (their motivations to follow a course of action) can help predict competitor's actions with a relatively higher level of confidence. The underlying assumption here is that decision makers in firms are essentially human and hence subject to the influences of affective and automatic processes described by neuroscientists. Hence by considering these factors along with a firm's capabilities, this model is a better predictor of competitive behavior.\n\nDespite its strengths, Porter's four corners model is not widely used in strategy and competitive intelligence. In a 2005 survey by the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals's (SCIP) frequently used analytical tools, Porter's four corners does not even figure in the top ten.\n\nHowever this model can be used in competitive analysis and strategy as follows:\n\nStrategy development and testing: Can be used to determine likely actions by competitors in response to the firm's strategy. This can be used when developing a strategy (such as for a new product launch) or to test this strategy using simulation techniques such as a business war game.\n\n'Early warning: The predictive nature of this tool can also alert firms to possible threats due to competitive action.\n\nPorter's four corners also works well with other analytical models. For instance it complements Porter five forces analysis well. Competitive cluster analysis of industry products in turn complements four corners analysis. Using such models that complement each other can help create a more complete analysis.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5155377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5155377", "title": "Qubo", "text": "Qubo\n\nQubo ( ; stylized as qubo) is an American multi-platform children's entertainment programming service. Qubo consists of a 24-hour television network, alternately known as Qubo Channel (which is available as a digital multicast service on owned-and-operated stations and some affiliates of corporate sister Ion Television, and on some pay television providers), a video on demand service, and the branding of a weekly programming block on Ion Television under the name \"Qubo Kids Corner\".\n\nIn May 2006, Ion Media Networks, NBC Universal (which owned a 32% interest in Ion Media at the time), Corus Entertainment, Scholastic Corporation and Classic Media (which is now owned by the aforementioned NBCUniversal through DreamWorks Animation) announced plans to launch a new, multi-platform children's entertainment brand known as Qubo, oriented towards providing \"educational, values-oriented programming\" targeted towards children between 4 and 18 years of age. The brand would encompass programming blocks on NBC Universal and Ion's respective flagship broadcast television networks (NBC, Telemundo and Ion Television), a video on demand service, a website, and a standalone 24-hour network to be carried as a digital subchannel on television stations owned by Ion Media Networks and by cable and satellite providers.\n\nQubo president Rick Rodriquez (who formerly served as a programming executive at Discovery Communications) explained in a 2008 interview with \"Multichannel News\" that Qubo was designed as a bilingual brand, offering programming in both English and Spanish. While Qubo would initially carry Spanish-language dubs of its programming for its Telemundo block, Rodriquez did not rule out the possibility of developing original children's programming tailored to Hispanic audiences through Qubo in the future. He felt that the market for Spanish-language children's programming had been underserved by existing outlets (such as Telemundo and Univision), and envisioned the possibility of programming which could \"bridge the gap\" and educate Spanish-speaking children on the English language, and vice versa.\n\nThe Qubo brand was intended to represent a \"building block for kids,\" as reflected by its logo. The name \"Qubo\" was chosen because it had a \"fun\" sound, and was usable in both English and Spanish.\n\nQubo launched on September 9, 2006, with the premiere of weekend morning blocks on NBC (which aired exclusively on Saturday mornings, replacing \"Discovery Kids on NBC\", a weekly block programmed by the Discovery Kids cable network) and Telemundo (which aired on both Saturday and Sunday mornings). That was followed on September 15 by the introduction of a daytime block on i: Independent Television (now Ion Television), which initially aired on Friday afternoons. At launch, its programming included the first-run animated series \"Dragon\" (produced by Scholastic) and \"Jane and the Dragon\" (produced by Corus subsidiary Nelvana), along with \"VeggieTales\" and its spinoffs \"3-2-1 Penguins!\" and \"\" (produced by Classic Media subsidiary Big Idea) – marking the first time that \"VeggieTales\" had ever been broadcast as a television program.\n\n\"VeggieTales\" and its spin-offs incorporated lessons related to Christian teachings; initially, this religious content was edited out of the original \"VeggieTales\" broadcasts on Qubo at the request of NBC's standards and practices department. The move, however, drew criticism from the conservative watchdog group Parents Television Council, which filed a complaint against NBC. A representative for NBC replied in a statement that the editing conformed to guidelines within the network's broadcast standards \"not to advocate any one religious point of view\". \"VeggieTales\" creator Phil Vischer also expressed discontent with the edits, stating that he was not informed that religious content would be removed from the series, and that he would have refused to sign a contract with Qubo if he had known of the decision beforehand. Vischer said, \"I would have declined partly because I knew a lot of fans would feel like it was a sellout or it was done for money.\" Still, Vischer added that he understood NBC's wish to remain religiously neutral, and said, \"\"VeggieTales\" is religious, NBC is not. I want to focus people more on 'Isn't it cool that Bob and Larry are on television?'\"\n\nIn December 2006, a Spanish-language version of the Qubo website was launched. A companion digital subchannel network, Qubo Channel, launched on Ion Media Networks' stations on January 8, 2007, initially featuring a schedule of children's programming in rolling four-hour blocks; Ion intended to seek carriage of the channel on cable, satellite and telco providers. In May of that year, NBC Universal sold its minority stake in Ion Media Networks to Citadel LLC. On December 3, 2007, Qubo Channel expanded its programming offerings to include shows from other producers, as well as some programs that were already airing on Ion Television's Qubo block. In addition, the rolling schedule was expanded to a six-hour block, which repeated four times per day.\n\nIn January 2008, Ion Media Networks and Comcast reached an agreement to continue carrying Ion's digital channels, including Qubo and Ion Life. In August 2008, Qubo introduced guidelines for advertisers in an effort to help combat childhood obesity, committing to only accept advertisements for products which meet nutritional guidelines determined by the network in collaboration with childhood obesity expert Goutham Rao. Qubo also began to air a series of public service announcements featuring characters from its programs in collaboration with the Ad Council, the United States Olympic Committee and the Department of Health and Human Services, advocating exercise and healthy living.\n\nIn May 2009, Ion Media Networks filed an inquiry with the Federal Communications Commission to seek must-carry cable and satellite carriage to expand Qubo's distribution to other providers. Later in May 2010, Ion signed carriage agreements with Advanced Cable Communications and Blue Ridge Communications, as well as deal with Comcast's Colorado Springs system to add Qubo on the providers' digital tiers.\n\nWith the acquisition of NBCUniversal by Comcast, it was announced on March 28, 2012, that NBC and Telemundo would discontinue their Qubo blocks and replace them with NBC Kids and MiTelemundo. Both blocks would be programmed by PBS Kids Sprout, a preschool-oriented television network that came under NBC ownership as part of the merger – on July 7; leaving Ion Television as the only remaining network with a Qubo-branded programming block (with Ion Media acquiring NBCUniversal's interest in the venture). At the time, PBS Kids Sprout was a competing joint venture between Comcast, HIT Entertainment, PBS and Sesame Workshop; NBCUniversal acquired full ownership of the cable network in November 2013, and PBS Kids Sprout suddenly became simply Sprout as a result.\n\nIon Media Networks acquired the stakes in Qubo held by Classic Media (which became DreamWorks Classics in 2012, after its acquisition by DreamWorks Animation), Scholastic and Corus Entertainment in 2013, with all three companies retaining program distribution partnerships with the network. The Qubo block on Ion Television was renamed as the \"Qubo Kids Corner\" on January 4, 2015, concurrent with the block's move from Friday to Sunday mornings.\n\nQubo Channel features archived content from the programming libraries of Corus Entertainment, DreamWorks Classics and Scholastic Corporation, with its programs targeted at children ages 2 to 15. Though there was an early promise of the three companies - NBC, Universal and Ion Media - to produce a new series for the network and program block each year, Qubo only produced one original series, \"Turbo Dogs\", which aired from 2007 to 2008. Qubo Channel regularly broadcasts series aimed at preschoolers during the morning and afternoon hours, while series aimed at older children are featured as part of the network's evening and midnight schedule.\n\nProgramming on Qubo Channel and its companion Ion Television block account for all educational programming content on Ion Television's owned-and-operated stations and certain Ion affiliates that carry the 24-hour channel, relieving the network from the responsibility of carrying programs compliant with guidelines dictated by the Children's Television Act on its other subchannel services (especially those that simulcast the Home Shopping Network and QVC, two networks that by virtue of their primary distribution via cable and satellite television, are exempt from the guidelines).\n\nOn September 28, 2010, Qubo Channel launched \"Qubo Night Owl\", (running from 12:00 to 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time) featuring classic animated series, many of which came from the Filmation library owned by DreamWorks Animation (currently owned by NBCUniversal). The block was restructured in August 2013 to feature a mix of animated and live-action series sourced solely from Qubo's distribution partners.\n\n, Qubo has current and pending affiliation agreements with 67 television stations encompassing 34 states and the District of Columbia. The network has an estimated national reach of 58.83% of all households in the United States (or 183,832,858 Americans with at least one television set). Like parent network Ion Television, the network's stations almost exclusively consist of network-owned stations (with the exception of Louisville, Kentucky affiliate WBNA). Qubo's programming is available by default via a national feed that is distributed directly to cable and satellite providers in markets without a local Ion Television station that carries the network.\n\nQubo does not have any over-the-air stations in several major markets, most notably Baltimore, Maryland; Toledo, Ohio; San Diego, California; Charlotte, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; Green Bay, Wisconsin; and Cincinnati, Ohio. A key factor in the network's limited national broadcast coverage is the fact that Ion Media Networks does not actively seek over-the-air distribution for the network on the digital subchannels of other network-affiliated stations (in contrast, its parent network Ion Television – which had similarly limited national coverage following the digital television transition – has begun subchannel-only affiliation arrangements through agreements with NBC Owned Television Stations' Telemundo Station Group subsidiary and Media General during 2014 and 2015), with very few stations that contractually carry the network's programming (with limited exceptions in markets such as Louisville, Kentucky and Anchorage, Alaska). As a result, Ion Media Networks owns the vast majority of the stations within Qubo's affiliate body.\n\n"}

At first Timur's squad was taken for hooligans as well, but eventually they earned gratitude. It was written in 1940, and quickly gained popularity, as other Gaidar's books. The same year a movie was released based on the novel. When the German invasion of the Soviet Union started in 1941, teams of Timurites all over the country, in addition to helping the families of soldiers, did large amounts of unskilled work: cleaning railways from snow, preparing firewood, loading/unloading cargo, etc. Their activities were widely reported in newspapers and by radio.\n\nThe book was an obligatory part of school curriculum in the Soviet Union.\n\nLater the Timurite movement was centralized and organized, with Central Staff and Congresses.\n\nTimurite teams were also created in other socialist states: GDR, People's Republic of Bulgaria, People's Republic of Poland, North Vietnam and Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.\n\nThe Timurite movement was revived in a number of post-Soviet States: in Russia, in Belarus, in Kazakhstan by Jas Otan, the youth wing of the ruling Nur Otan party.\n\n"}
{"id": "56320669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56320669", "title": "Two Point Hospital", "text": "Two Point Hospital\n\nTwo Point Hospital is a 2018 business simulation game developed by Two Point Studios and published by Sega for Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows. A spiritual successor to Bullfrog Productions' 1997 game \"Theme Hospital\", \"Two Point Hospital\" puts players in the role of a hospital administrator tasked with constructing and operating a hospital (and, by extension, an empire of hospitals in the fictional Two Point County, where the game is set) with the goal of curing patients of fictitious, comical ailments. The game was designed and developed by some of the creators of \"Theme Hospital\", including Mark Webley and Gary Carr. They made use of their expertise in developing games such as \"Theme Hospital\" and \"Black & White\" and wanted players to be confident in using the menus. The use of humour was deemed important because visiting real hospitals is unpopular.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" was released to a positive reception from critics, who acclaimed it for its style, humour and its faithfulness to \"Theme Hospital\"'s aesthetics, but the game was criticised for its repetitiveness and lack of challenge.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" offers a similar style of gameplay to that of \"Theme Hospital\". Players take on the role of a hospital manager charged with constructing and maintaining a hospital; tasks include building rooms and amenities that cater for patients and staff (such as toilets, staffrooms, reception desks, cafés, and seating), expanding the hospital into new plots, the hiring and management of doctors, nurses, janitors, and assistants to maintain the hospital; and dealing with a variety of comical illnesses. \"Two Point Hospital\" features unique, comical conditions, including \"Light-Headedness\" (having a light bulb for a head), \"Pandemic\" (having a pan on one's head), \"Mock Star\" (patients are Freddie Mercury impersonators), \"Cubism\", and \"Animal Magnetism\" (having animals stuck to the patient's body; the latter disease was planned for \"Theme Hospital\" but was cut.). Like \"Theme Hospital\", hospitals start out empty.\n\nPatients' diagnosis begins in a GP's Office before they are sent for further diagnosis in other rooms, and eventually treatment. From time to time, emergencies (an influx of patients with a specific disease) can occur. The hospital has a reputation rating (affected by how well it is doing) that affects the chances of new patients coming. Every game year, there is an awards ceremony in which the player is awarded performance-based rewards. There are 15 hospitals within in Two Point County, the game's setting.\n\nThe game features modifications to \"Theme Hospital\"s gameplay - while rooms are square or rectangular, they can be expanded with individual additional plots; staff have personalities that affect their work and specialisations; expansion of the hospital onto new plots requires the player to wait for a fixed time before they can build rooms in the new wings; patients will require players to tend to their needs such as hunger and entertainment by establishing amenities such as vending machines, magazine racks, telephones, and plants; the completion of challenges and other tasks awards \"Kudosh\", a currency that can be used to unlock new items that can be placed within rooms and corridors. Training is more complex than in \"Theme Hospital\"; all staff (not just doctors) can learn and receive qualifications that grant them new skills or improve their ability in a certain department. For example, the General Practitioner skill improves a doctor's skill in the GP's Office. Assistants can run marketing programmes to attract patients with a certain illness or staff with certain skills. When patients die, they sometimes become ghosts, which disrupt the hospital by terrorising patients and staff. Only janitors with the Ghost Capture skill can remove them. New rooms and machine upgrades can be researched in the Research room, and unlike \"Theme Hospital\", researched rooms and upgrades are available throughout the empire (they do not have to be re-researched in each hospital). Machines upgrades are performed by trained janitors.\n\nElements new to the game include Star Ratings, Hospital Levels, and room prestige. Each hospital has a set of objectives, including the curing of a set number of patients, an increase of the hospital's value, the earning of a fixed sum of money, and an increase of the hospital's level that eventually increases the hospital's Star Rating. The achievement of a one-star rating allows players to progress to the next hospital, though they may continue building up their current hospital by completing additional objectives to increase the rating to two or three stars. If the player moves on, (s)he can return to the hospital at anytime. Once a three-star rating is awarded, players can continue running the current hospital. Hospital Levels are determined by the number of rooms and staff members a hospital has – increasing the level unlocks more skilled staff to hire. A room's prestige is affected by its size and ornamentation, and the higher a room's prestige level, the happier staff are inside it.\n\nThe game features online leaderboards, and co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes. An updated released in October 2018 also added a sandbox mode.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" is a spiritual sequel to \"Theme Hospital\", a 1997 simulation game developed by Bullfrog Productions and released by Electronic Arts. Among those involved in the development of both games were \"Theme Hospital\"s producer Mark Webley, its lead artist Gary Carr, and its lead composer Russell Shaw. \"Theme Hospital\" followed \"Theme Park\", also developed by Bullfrog, and there had been plans to expand the range of \"Theme\" simulation games. Near the time of \"Theme Hospital\"s release, Electronic Arts began exerting more control over the products made by Bullfrog, leading to the departure of Webley and Peter Molyneux who co-founded Lionhead Studios, and Carr who joined Mucky Foot Productions, and the expansion of Bullfrog's \"Theme\" series never happened.\n\nAfter they left Bullfrog, Webley and Carr continued to discuss a follow-up to \"Theme Hospital\". Their first attempt was \"ER Tycoon\", which was planned during Carr's time at Mucky Foot Productions but was cancelled because they could not find a publisher for the game. Mucky Foot closed in 2003 and Carr joined Lionhead; however, ongoing projects did not permit the continuation of the \"Theme\" concept. In 2015, Carr left Lionhead, which was closed by Microsoft Game Studios the following year. Webley had left the studio in 2013. They designed to found Two Point Studios to follow up on the \"Theme\" idea. Webley stated, \"Gary and I have been talking about this project for a number of years and are really excited to be announcing Two Point Studios\". \n\nThe timing of a \"Theme Hospital\"-style game was also apt: Art director Mark Smart said making a hospital-simulation game \"felt right\" and that there was \"a lot of love for Theme Hospital\", while studio co-founder and technical director Ben Hymers said players had been wanting a sequel to \"Theme Hospital\" for years. According to Webley and Carr, \"Two Point Hospital\" is a completely new game, rather than a reapplication of new assets to an existing game. Carr said \"I wanted to work on something like Theme Hospital again, appealing to a broader range of people\". The game was developed by envisioning fictional symptoms, often based on word play, and the means for the player to cure them, and determining which ones most attracted the attention of the development team. Webley and Carr also wanted to develop a graphics style that would remain \"future-proof\" relative to changes in graphics rendering technology, and opted to use claymation-like effects, which they found made it easy for players to observe on-screen situations and would not become dated.\n\nOnline features were an early target of the design of \"Two Point Hospital\"; Webley and Carr recognised that players of management games tend to prefer single-player experiences. They designed the online elements of the game to be opt-in and to feature asynchronous gameplay elements, including multiplayer challenges. Players would be tasked with achieving objectives such as curing patients within a set number of months and their scores would be placed on online leaderboards. Players would be able to view their progress compared to that of friends and other players during the challenge from these leaderboards, an approach Webley and Carr took from ghosts that are used in some arcade racing games. \"Theme Hospital\" was recognised as one of the first games with support for mods; Webley and Carr said \"Two Point Hospital\" would feature mod support, which will not be available at launch.\n\nTo produce the game, Webley and Carr considered a few approaches to developing the game before signing with Sega. They originally considered crowdfunding the development through Kickstarter; they spoke to Playtonic Games, which had used Kickstarter to revive a 1990s property \"Banjo-Kazooie\" for \"Yooka-Laylee\". Shortly afterwards, however, they found video game development via Kickstarter was waning and decided this approach was too risky. They also considered taking an early access approach. Hymers suggested they approach Sega as a publisher, which was fortuitous because Sega wanted to expand their profile with games similar to \"Theme Hospital\". While they were in negotiations with Sega, they selected a number of Lionhead Studios developers to help with \"Two Point Hospital\"s development, but Microsoft closed Lionhead in April 2016 before the Sega deal was complete and they had to quickly choose their staff on limited funds, building the team more quickly than they had planned.\n\nAccording to Hymers, the developers used their experience in making games including \"Theme Hospital\", \"Populous\", and \"Black & White\" to make \"Two Point Hospital\", which \"GamesTM\" described as \"engrossing time-vacuum gameplay\". Smart said the team wanted the game to be accessible and not throw players in at the deep end, and that they wanted players to have confidence when examining the sub-menus and realising the level of strategy involved. Smart also said people do not like to visit hospitals and that using humour makes a difference. According to Smart, the ailments were concocted backwards; someone would decide that they wanted something and the team worked from that, or that they worked on them from \"terrible puns\".\n\nHymers said queues of patients and their movement along corridors was difficult to produce because the game is in 3D, which raised questions about wall thickness and cell width. He compared these elements with their counterparts in \"Theme Hospital\" and believed it was much easier in that game, which is 2D with graphics made from sprites, and that people were drawn in front of the walls. He also stated that making people avoid each other was tricky. The game was developed using the Unity engine. A later patch for the game featured character customisation, and a \"copy and paste\" rooms feature.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" was announced on 16 January 2018 in a short YouTube video showing the game's visuals and comedic styling, and depicted a patient suffering from Light Headedness. \"Edge\" compared this disease's role in the game's marketing to that of \"Theme Hospital\"s Bloaty Head, which was described as its \"poster disease\".\n\nThe first public viewing of \"Two Point Hospital\" was held at the PC Gamer weekender on 17 February 2018. The gameplay demo explored the game's user interface and its turning camera, which was not present in \"Theme Hospital\". The game's publisher also announced a potential release date in August 2018. The panel discussed some of the new ailments that would be included in the game, confirming one that changes the patient into a mummy. In a \"GamesTM\" preview, Smart stated that the closest illness in the game is Hurty Leg, which he described as \"almost like somebody in plaster\".\n\nDevelopers Two Point Studios announced in a newsletter that subscribers would receive a \"golden ticket\" that would allow the player to download an in-game \"golden lavatory\". An hour-long gameplay demo that included information about the release was available during E3 2018.\n\nIn July 2018, Steam began accepting pre-orders for the game, which was released on 30 August 2018.\n\nOn 23 October 2018, a Halloween patch was released, which introduced a spookier soundtrack, new DJ lines, a night-time intervention on some levels, and the 'Frightheadedness' disease.\n\n\"Two Point Hospital\" received critical acclaim. Media review aggregation website Metacritic summarised the game as garnering \"Generally favorable reviews\".\n\nThe game received praise for its nostalgia compared with that of \"Theme Hospital\" and its improvements over it. Rachel Weber of \"Games Radar\" was positive about the game's use of nostalgia, stating that the game had \"taken the funny bones\" from the original and transplanted them into \"Two Point Hospital\". Weber also praised other aspects of the game, calling it a \"delight\". Johnny Chiodini of \"EuroGamer\" stated that the game \"stays true to the spirit of its sort-of predecessor\" in \"Theme Hospital\", and that it was a \"modernised successor\". Chiodini also called the game a \"welcome reinvention of a childhood classic\". The game's similarity to \"Theme Hospital\" was also praised by \"Edge\", who said it \"extends beyond its predecessor both in terms of detail and scope\" and that \"Theme Hospital\" had been replaced by \"something better\". \"GamesTM\" described \"Two Point Hospital\" as \"Theme Hospital 2.0\" and \"A modern take on a beloved title\", but also believed that it could have distanced itself from it more. Similar compliments about the game's similarities to \"Theme Hospital\" were given by Jeuxvideo.com and James Ide of the \"Daily Mirror\". Even before release, Dominic Tarason of \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" described \"Two Point Hospital\" as \"Theme Hospital 2 in all but name\". This view was shared by \"Bit-Tech\"s Rick Lane, who described \"Two Point Hospital\" as \"Theme Hospital\"s \"sequel in all but name\". Jacob Bukacek of \"Hardcore Gamer\" was of the opinion that \"Two Point Hospital\" used \"Theme Hospital\" as a base for improvement and remarked that it \"isn’t Theme Hospital remade; It’s Theme Hospital improved\". \"Game Informer\"s Ben Reeves thought that Two Point Studios had done \"a remarkable job reviving Theme Hospital\". \"GamesMaster\" described \"Two Point Hospital\" as \"the perfect cure\" for \"Bullfrog deficiency\" and said it is precisely what \"Theme Hospital\" fans wanted it to be.\n\nCritics also praised the game's humorous content. UK newspaper \"Metro\" regarded the \"amusing script and visual humour\" of \"Two Point Hospital\" as one of its best features, calling it \"endearing\". Nic Rueben of \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" also commented on the game's humour, writing; \"it’s not that any individual element is hilarious – it’s more of an infinite dads pulling infinite crackers sort of scenario. It just feels comfy, goofy and pleasant ...\" \"GamesTM\" believed the humour was taken from Bullfrog and praised its balance, saying the game is not \"trying too hard\" and keeps it light-hearted. Jason Coles of the \"Daily Star\" also liked the game's \"Good sense of humour\" and abundance of puns. James Swinbanks of \"GameSpot\" echoed these sentiments by describing the game's \"British\" sense of humour as the game's \"overwhelming charm\", as did Paul Tamburro of \"Game Revolution\" with his description of the game as \"delightfully lighthearted\", and \"GamesRadar+\"s Rachel Weber's concurrence with Swinbanks about the humour's Britishness. \"Shacknews\"'s Chris Jarrard compared the game's \"outstanding\" radio station to \"SimCity 2000\"s (which he described as \"nonsensical\") news system.\n\nJose Cabrera of \"IGN Spain\" was positive about gameplay but critiqued its lack of challenge (an opinion shared by Tamburro). Cabrera referred to the game as being \"fun and casual\", but was well put together. Cabrera also called the game a \"perfectly balanced simulation\" that is based on the nostalgia of \"Theme Hospital\". TJ Hafer believed \"Two Point Hospital\" \"revitalizes the business management genre\". Fraser Brown of \"PC Gamer\" magazine was positive about the game's release, calling it a \"brilliant management game regardless of nostalgia\". Brown, however, was critical of the game's balance, saying some \"missions bleed together\" and only a few levels are noticeably distinct.\n\nOther criticisms include the game basics being too similar to those of \"Theme Hospital\", repetition, the lack of an ability to copy rooms, and the lack of a sandbox mode.\n\n"}

Michels argued that this amounted to an iron law of oligarchy: all groups, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, eventually and inevitably develop into oligarchies with swollen bureaucracies. Michels himself, after falling out with the German Social Democrat Party, migrated to Italy and joined Mussolini's Fascist Party. Nevertheless, his ideas were popularized after the Second World War in particular by Seymour Martin Lipset, Trow, and James Samuel Coleman in a book entitled, \"\" (1957). This book argued that the ITU was an exception to Michels' general law, and that the conditions necessary to ensure democracy were that an opposition to the union's leadership could form. This depended on ensuring the leadership did not monopolize the channels of communication with members. Lipset and his coauthors confined their understanding of \"democracy\" to the existence of organised opposition. They were skeptical that the conditions in the ITU, which made it democratic, were likely to arise in many other unions spontaneously. Following this, in 1959, the US Federal government passed the Landrum-Griffin Act 1959 to mandate democratic principles be followed in union governance.\n\n\nPrinciples include:\n\nWhile there are some superficial similarities to the so-called organizing model of union activity, advocates of union democracy are swift to point out that many of the alleged exemplars of the organizing model do not, in their internal structure, meet the requirements listed above.\n\n\n"}

VAT recovery in the EU is a complex, unstructured process that presents multiple challenges for governance and corporate tax officers. Claims are addressed using semi-automated/manual and error-prone processes that are both time-consuming and costly. Failed and incorrect claims result in loss of revenue, lack of financial governance and improper compliance.\n\nVATBox automatically detects and recovers VAT – both foreign and domestic - wherever the tax is charged. VATBox's technology - which is part of growing trend in FinTech and RegTech automation - captures the data and evidence from multiple sources, matches and validates the data, pinpoints any leaks or missing evidence, determines whether it qualifies for VAT recovery, and if it does, then submits the claim. The solution also performs analytics, providing real-time visibility to all ongoing claims both at aggregate and detailed levels. The company also holds numerous patents relating to use of technology in the reclaim process.\n\nIn August 2015, VATBox closed $24 million in financing led by the Viola Growth Fund, part of the Viola Group. In February 2017, VATBox announced the completion of a $20 million financing round led by Target Global Fund and with the participation of existing investors Viola Private Equity and other private investors.\n\nVATBox was ranked the 50 most promising private Israeli startups by Calcalist, a leading business publication in Israel.\n\nVATBox has 1500 customers in over 40 countries. The company employs 150 employees in offices in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, New York & Tel Aviv.\n"}
