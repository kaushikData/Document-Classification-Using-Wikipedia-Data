It is located at Herald Square in Midtown Manhattan where 34th Street, Broadway and Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) intersect, and is served by the:\n\nThis station complex has a long mezzanine above the platforms. Three staircases and two elevators lead to each of the two Broadway line platforms. Three pairs of escalators lead to the Sixth Avenue line platforms (two to the northbound one and one to the southbound one). There is a non-ADA-compliant ramp that leads to an intermediate level. This level has two sets of staircases leading to each of the Sixth Avenue platforms. The elevators to this level are at the north end of the mezzanine.\nAt the north end of this mezzanine is the 35th Street exit, which contains a bank of turnstiles, token booth, and street stairs. Three staircases lead to all corners of Sixth Avenue and 35th Street except the southwest one. There is also a short passageway to either western corner of Broadway and 35th Street.\n\nIn addition to this exit, the mezzanine has connections with the two entrances at Broadway/Sixth Avenue and 34th Street. The entrance on the west side is staffed full-time and has two staircases to 34th Street. The northwest staircase has an entrance to an underground Burger King. There is a long passageway containing a single street elevator that leads to PATH at 33rd Street. The entrance on the east side of 34th Street is staffed part-time and when the token booth is closed, only two HEET turnstiles provide access to the mezzanine. This entrance has a passageway that connects to the 35th Street exit and has two pairs of exit-only turnstiles from the mezzanine.\n\nThere is another mezzanine at the south end of the Sixth Avenue level that has two staircases leading to each platform. It is directly underneath the PATH station mezzanine (two levels from street level) and has a passageway leading to the entrance at Broadway and 32nd Street. Outside of fare control, there is an entrance leading directly to the two basement levels of J. C. Penney in the Manhattan Mall. There are also escalators that lead to the front entrance of the mall. The entrance at Broadway and 32nd Street is unstaffed, has two street stairs, and one stair to each of the two Broadway platforms on the very south end. There are street stairs to either northern corner of Broadway and 32nd Street, as well as to the northeast corner of 6th Avenue and 32nd Street\n\nThere are closed passageways (but not free transfers) to the adjacent 42nd Street–Bryant Park station to the north and to 34th Street–Penn Station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.\n\nThere was once an out-of-system passageway to Pennsylvania Station one block west. During the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway had high rates of crime, as did the rest of the city; the passageway similarly experienced high crime rates. The passageway, with only two exits–one at each end–was located under 33nd Street and was so named because it was next to the basements of the Gimbels department store and the Hotel Pennsylvania. This passageway was closed in the 1990s and passengers now must walk at street level to connect to the commuter railroads. A real estate developer, Vornado Realty Trust, proposed in 2010 to reopen the passageway in exchange for variances to build office towers replacing existing structures in the area.\n\nThe pathway to Bryant Park was outside of fare control, but was intended to relieve passenger flow at the 42nd and 34th Street stations. In the 1980s, the passageway became a gathering spot for homeless people and drug users. The passageway was closed on March 23, 1991 after a rape.\n\nOn November 28, 1969, the turnstiles and exit gates at the northern end of the station were relocated, making four more staircases from the Broadway Line platforms available for transfers to the Sixth Avenue platforms. Previously, transfers could only be made from two staircases.\n\nThis complex was overhauled in the late 1970s. The Transit Authority fixed the station's structure and renovated its appearance. The overhaul replaced the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting to the 1970s modern look wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. It also fixed staircases and platform edges. In the early 1990s, the station received another major repair, which included an upgrade for ADA-accessibility and modernized wall tiling. The MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiling for the walls, installed new tiling on the floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, installing ADA safety threads along the platform edge, new signs, and new track-beds in both directions.\n34th Street–Herald Square on the BMT Broadway Line is an express station that has four tracks and two island platforms. This level opened several years after the opening of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson station; the Sixth Avenue line platforms were built later.\n\nEach platform has three staircases and one elevator to the main mezzanine on the north half and another staircase at the extreme south end to 32nd Street. North of the station are diamond crossovers in both directions that are used by N trains on weekdays when they operate express in Manhattan.\n\nBecause Queens-bound N trains switch from the express to the local track north of this station, trains are often held here until another train arrives on the opposite track. Depending on the schedule, they may not leave in the same order in which they arrived. This causes confusion among riders as they run back and forth on the northbound platform trying to catch the train that will leave first. This is also true at other stations where two services that run to the same destination stop at the same platform but do not stop on the same side of the platform, such as Franklin Avenue (southbound 2 and 5 trains), Canal Street (A, C and E trains), 59th Street–Columbus Circle (southbound B and D trains), Queens Plaza (E, M and R trains) and Essex Street (outbound J/Z and M trains). \"The New York Times\" calls this \"The Subway Shuffle\".\n\nIn 1996, artist Christopher Janney installed \"REACH New York, An Urban Musical Instrument.\" The piece consists of green racks with sensors hanging along the platforms. Waving one's hands in front of the sensors creates a corresponding sound from the rack.\n\n34th Street–Herald Square on the IND Sixth Avenue Line is an express station that has four tracks and two island platforms. The mezzanine elevators are at the north end of the station while the staircases to the Manhattan Mall entrance are at the south end. The platforms have numerous stairs and escalators leading to the main mezzanine. Stairs on both platforms lead to a non-accessible ramp leading to the mezzanine.\n\nThe platforms are not equal in length, as the northbound one is longer than the southbound one. North of this station are numerous crossovers and switches that allow trains from uptown to terminate here on the express tracks during construction and closures.\n\nDuring construction on the IND portion of this station, contractors had to counter problems in their path. For one, the BMT and PATH platforms existed decades before this portion of the station was completed. Constructors had to dig deeper in order to pass the original platforms without interference, as well as avoiding wires and pipes.\n\nPrior to the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection in November 1967, the express tracks only extended to bumper blocks about south of this station, though the tunnels extended for another beyond that.\nOn August 28, 2004, Shahawar Matin Siraj and James Elshafay were arrested for planning to bomb the Herald Square station during the 2004 Republican National Convention. Elshafay cooperated with prosecutors and received a plea deal; Siraj was convicted of conspiracy on four counts, the most serious of which was plotting to bomb a public transportation system, in 2006 and was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2007.\n\n\n"}

It is a 13-story, 220 foot skyscraper designed by the Boston and Baltimore-based architectural firm of Parker & Thomas, and constructed in 1904-1906.\n\n\"When the original Second Empire style headquarters on the corner of Baltimore and Calvert street was destroyed in the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, Baltimore & Ohio Railroad executives decided to build a new 13 story steel-framed building two blocks west of the old site. The building's entrance is adorned by two sculptures: Mercury, the Roman god for commerce, and a figure named Progress of Industry, which holds a torch and a locomotive; Progress of Industry clearly invokes the company's position not only as an industry leader, but also the company's aspiration to be a vehicle of progress.\"\n\nIt was designed by the architectural firm of Parker and Thomas of Baltimore and Boston, assisted by Herbert D. Hale and Henry G. Morse, and built by the construction firm of the brothers W. W. and E. A. Wells of Chicago. The same group had successfully teamed up a couple of years earlier on the Belvedere Hotel, an eleven-story Beaux-Arts building, about one mile up North Charles Street in the Mount Vernon area of downtown Baltimore.\n\n\"The 13-story office building, built in 1906, served as headquarters for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad for 75 years. The building's beauty and elegance of its marbled lobbies, ornate stairs and Tiffany stained-glass windows became an instant landmark in downtown Baltimore and it symbolized the power and prestige of America's largest and oldest railroad.\" The impressive building includes seven different kinds of marble imported from six countries representing four continents. The first 3 floors of the exterior façade are clad in New Hampshire granite, while Bedford stone is utilized from the fourth floor and above. The trim is terra cotta tile. The building's H shape design provides for a large number of window offices. The ornate main lobby contains two white marble staircases, grand chandeliers and many decorative details.\n\nAs the building neared completion in 1906, The Baltimore Sun ran a glowing piece under the headline, \"A Palace for B. and O. - Headquarters a Monument to City's Progressiveness\", \"A model of architecture, with ornamentation and decorations, inside and out, of the richest and most up-to-date design, the new Baltimore and Ohio building, now nearing completion at the northwest corner of Baltimore and Charles Streets, opposite the new home of the Baltimore Sun, will be a lasting monument to Baltimore's progressiveness. Not only is it the largest office building in Maryland, and perhaps along the Atlantic Coast south of Philadelphia, but it ranks among the finest in the world in style and completeness.\" The article went on to relate the tremendous skill of the craftsmen, the gigantic size of the structure, including 1,600 windows, and the great number of employees, who would work there, 1,000 in all, 500 of whom could be fed at any one time in the company dining room.\n\nWhen the B&O Headquarters Building was completed, it was the second tallest structure in Baltimore to the 16 story 249 foot Continental Trust Company Building, two blocks away at 201 East Baltimore St., which was constructed in 1900-1901 to designs prepared by the Chicago skyscraper architect D.H. Burnham and Company.\n\nThe current occupant of the building, The Hotel Monaco, rhapsodizes on its website, \"The (B&O) Headquarters opened its doors at midnight on September 12, 1906 to the dazzling spectacle of more than 5,000 electric lights that 'burst into fire and presented a grand spectacle', as reported by The (Baltimore) Sun. The newspaper went on to point out that Oscar G. Murray, B&O Railroad president, chose to move into his office suite the next day, September 13. 'The structure is 13 stories high; Murray started in the railroad business on January 13, 1872; and he was elected the thirteenth president of the railroad,' furthered the news report. Of course, Murray's office number was 13 and his phone extension was the same. Amusing anecdotes aside, the building is known for architectural greatness. The exterior is dignified and monumental, with beautiful carving and ornamental work showing off the craftsmanship of yesteryear. Perhaps one of the most compelling features is the building's statuary over the main entrance. Believed to predate the statuary at New York's Grand Central Station and designed by John Evans & Co. of Boston, the figure of Mercury and an allegorical feature cradling a locomotive represent transportation and commerce.\"\n\nThe B&O Railroad Headquarters Building lies within the Baltimore Business and Government Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. In 2001 the City of Baltimore's Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation and the Maryland Historical Trust designated the B&O Building one the city's ten most historically consequential buildings.\n\nThe owner of the property, Baltimore and Charles Associates, went bankrupt in 2010 and the property was then subdivided into a \"condominium regime\" and Kimpton bought the hotel space and restaurant space for approximately $33 million and Kenwood Management Co. of Bethesda, purchased the office space for $1.3 million. Baltimore and Charles Associates, spent about $65 million to buy and renovate the B&O Building from 2007 to 2009. Philadelphia-based Arc Wheeler LLC, was the project's lead developer and at the time was also planning to redevelop the former McCormick & Co. spice plant site at Conway and Light streets downtown, which fell through.\n\nThe original $48 million acquisition and construction loan for the B&O Building was arranged by Philadelphia-based, BlueStone Real Estate Capital, a real estate investment bank.\n\nThe architect for the historic restoration and renovation project was RCG from Baltimore. The restoration received an Award of Excellence by the Maryland Society of American Institute of Architects and numerous other awards for historic preservation.\n\nSince 2009, following a 3-year renovation, the B&O Headquarters Building has been a 202-room Hotel Monaco, a Kimpton property, the largest boutique hotel chain in the U.S., and has housed the B&O American Brasserie. It also has three floors of office space and BB&T on the first floor. As configured currently it has 220,500 square feet of space.\n"}

{"id": "305503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305503", "title": "Chamber of commerce", "text": "Chamber of commerce\n\nA chamber of commerce (or board of trade) is a form of business network, for example, a local organization of businesses whose goal is to further the interests of businesses. Business owners in towns and cities form these local societies to advocate on behalf of the business community. Local businesses are members, and they elect a board of directors or executive council to set policy for the chamber. The board or council then hires a President, CEO or Executive Director, plus staffing appropriate to size, to run the organization.\n\nThe first chamber of commerce was founded in 1599 in Marseille, France. Another official chamber of commerce would follow 65 years later, probably in Bruges, then part of the Spanish Netherlands.\n\nThe world's oldest English-speaking chamber of commerce is the Jersey Chamber founded in February 1768, the same year the New York City Chamber was founded, The oldest known existing chamber in the English-speaking world with continuous records, the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, was founded in 1783. However, Hull Chamber of Commerce is the UK's oldest, followed by those of Leeds and of Belfast in present day Northern Ireland.\n\nAs a non-governmental institution, a chamber of commerce has no direct role in the writing and passage of laws and regulations that affect businesses. It may however, lobby in an attempt to get laws passed that are favorable to businesses.\n\nMembership in an individual chamber can range from a few dozen to well over 800,000, as is the case with the Paris Île-de-France Regional Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Some chamber organizations in China report even larger membership numbers. Chambers of commerce can range in scope from individual neighborhoods within a city or town up to an international chamber of commerce.\n\nIn the United States, chambers do not operate in the same manner as the Better Business Bureau in that, while the BBB has the authority to bind its members under a formal operation doctrine (and, thus, can remove them if complaints arise regarding their services), the local chamber membership is either voluntary or required by law. In addition, Chambers represent the interests of businesses, while the BBB represents both the interests of businesses and the general public. Some Chambers are partially funded by local government, others are non-profit, and some are a combination of the two. Chambers of commerce also can include economic development corporations or groups (though the latter can sometimes be a formal branch of a local government, the groups work together and may in some cases share office facilities) as well as tourism and visitor bureaus.\n\nSome chambers have joined state, national (such as the United States Chamber of Commerce and the British Chambers of Commerce) and even international bodies (such as Eurochambres, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Worldchambers). Currently, there are about 13,000 chambers registered in the official Worldchambers Network registry, and the chamber of commerce network is the largest business network globally. This network is informal, with each local chamber incorporated and operating separately, rather than as a chapter of a national or state chamber. \n\nChambers of commerce in the United States can be considered community, city, regional, state, or nationwide (United States Chamber of Commerce). City Chambers work on the local level to bring the business community together to develop strong local networks, which can result in a business-to-business exchange. In most cases, city Chambers work with their local government, such as their mayor, their city council and local representatives to develop pro-business initiatives.\nThere are also bilateral chambers of commerce that link the business environments of two countries (e.g. Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce, Moldovan–American Chamber of Commerce).\n\nCommunity chambers of commerce started in the UK and later spread to in the US, becoming city chambers of commerce as communities developed and became larger. Community chambers of commerce are smaller and most have a limit on numbers of members.\n\nCity chambers of commerce have a long history in the US. The Charleston Chamber of Commerce is one of the oldest, dating back to colonial 1773. That same year, Boston's Chamber of Commerce organized a seminal tax protest: The Boston Tea Party.\n\nIn 2005 there were 2,800 chambers of commerce in the United States and 102 chambers representing U.S. businesses overseas. According to the Association for Chamber of Commerce Executives (ACCE), there are approximately 3,000 chambers of commerce with at least one staff person and \"thousands more established as strictly volunteer entities\".\n\nState chambers of commerce are much different from local and regional chambers of commerce, as they work on state and sometimes federal issues impacting the business community. Just as the local chamber is critical to the local business community, state chambers serve a unique function, serving as a third party voice on important business legislation that impact the business community and are critical in shaping legislation in their respective state. State Chambers work with their Governor, state representatives, state senators, US congressional leaders and US Senators. In comparison with state trade associations, which serve as a voice and resource to a particular industry, state chambers are looked to as a respected voice, representing the entire business community to enhance and advocate for a better business environment.\n\nUnderstanding the National or International need for understanding and information is the key service that these level of chambers of commerce provide. These services are in most cases are at no fee or cost to their members, some of the resources offer personal and/or business services that may have a very low fee (Memberships to other association like the NRA etc.).\n\nUnder the compulsory or public law model, enterprises of certain sizes, types, or sectors are obliged to become members of the chamber. This model is common in European Union countries (e.g. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria), as well as Japan. Main tasks of the chambers are foreign trade promotion, vocational training, regional economic development, and general services to their members. The chambers were given responsibilities of public administration in various fields by the state which they exercise in order management. The chambers also have a consultative function; this means the chambers must be consulted whenever a new law related to industry or commerce is proposed.\n\nIn Germany, the chambers of commerce and industry (\"IHK - Industrie- und Handelskammer\") and the chambers of skilled crafts (\"HwK - Handwerkskammer\") are public statutory bodies with self-administration under the inspectorate of the state ministry of economy. Enterprises are members by law according to the chamber act (\"IHK-Gesetz\") of 1956. Because of this, such chambers are much bigger than chambers under private law. IHK Munich, the biggest German chamber of commerce, has 350,000 member companies. Germany also has compulsory chambers for \"free occupations\" such as architects, dentists, engineers, lawyers, notaries, physicians and pharmacists.\n\nUnder the private model, which exists in English-speaking countries like USA, Canada or the UK, but as well in Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, companies are not obligated to become chamber members. However, companies often become members to develop their business contacts and, regarding the local chambers (the most common level of organization), to demonstrate a commitment to the local economy. Though governments are not required to consult chambers on proposed laws, the chambers are often contacted given their local influence and membership numbers.\n\nA multilateral chamber is formed of companies (and sometimes individuals) from different countries with a common business interest towards or in a specific country. It can further be active in representing the interests of local and foreign investors in that specific country, achieved through promotion and proactivity regarding the general business environment. Multilateral chambers of commerce are independent entities strengthening business relations and interactions between all economic players, and their members may benefit from a broad range of activities that enhance the visibility and reputation of their business.\n\nIn many countries Chambers of Commerce are a source of private sector information. The information is usually gathered by surveying Chamber members. The British Chambers of Commerce Quarterly Economic Survey is an example of a Chambers of Commerce survey that is used by official governmental departments as a guide to the performance of the economy.\n\n"}

He took over Franklin's printing business and that of publishing the \"Pennsylvania Gazette\" newspaper that Franklin had started. Hall formed his own printing firm in 1766 and did publishing for the government and printing of paper money.\n\nHall was born in 1714 in Westfield near Edinburgh, Scotland. His father was James Hall.\n\nHall was apprenticed in 1729 for five years at the age of 15 to a printing firm in Scotland run by John Mosman and William Brown. Hall’s friend William Strahan sent a letter to lawyer James Read of Philadelphia in January 1743 inquiring about opportunities for printers in the American colonies. Strahan first recommended Hall to his wife's cousin and described him as an honest hard working person. Read presented the letter to Benjamin Franklin, who needed a journeyman printer. Franklin sent back a letter to Strahan on July 10 inviting Hall to come to Philadelphia for a job interview. In the letter Franklin said that if Hall didn't ultimately like the position offered, he would pay his expenses back to England. Franklin offered Hall 12 months of \"Good Work\" for the trouble of coming from England and trying the journeyman printer position. Hall accepted the offer and came to Philadelphia on June 19, 1744.\n\nHall adapted well to his new career and learned the skills of the printing trade. He became a professional in the eighteenth-century printing business which Franklin developed throughout Colonial America. Hall became very involved as a major participant in the printing business when he started working for Franklin in 1744. He became the foreman of Franklin's shop in 1746 and did all the editing and publishing of the \"Pennsylvania Gazette\" newspaper that Franklin started. Franklin considered semiretirement in 1747, since Hall was an active partner. He made Hall an official partner on an eighteen-year contract in 1748 and went on to other interests for his full retirement. The printing business became known as the Franklin and Hall firm.\n\nFranklin completed the sale of his share of the printing business to Hall in February 1766. William Sellers became a journeyman printer for Hall and was a skillful printer. In May 1766 Hall made Sellers a partner in his business. The new firm of Hall and Sellers printed all of the official documents for the government of the Province of Pennsylvania, including its paper money. Hall also had a book store connected to the printing shop that sold books and stationary that he produced.\n\nHall married Mary Leacock (Laycock) on January 7, 1748 at Christ Church in Philadelphia. They had four children.\n\nHall was a member of the St. Andrews Society and printed its documents. Hall was a member of the Union Library Company that later became part of the Library Company of Philadelphia. In 1762 he was Master of a Mason lodge in Philadelphia.\n\nThe American Philosophical Society made Hall a member on March 8, 1768. He did not participate except in 1771 when he was a member of a committee to set a selling price for its publication of its transactions, which he published.\n\nHall was a contributor to the Pennsylvania Hospital, the College of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Contributorship fire insurance company, and the Philadelphia Silk Society.\n\nHall died on December 24, 1772, and is buried at Christ Church cemetery in Philadelphia.\n\nExample works printed by Hall.\n"}
{"id": "2081765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2081765", "title": "EWeek", "text": "EWeek\n\neWeek (\"Enterprise Newsweekly\", stylized as \"eWEEK\") is a technology and business magazine, owned by QuinStreet. The magazine was acquired in 2012 by QuinStreet from the company Ziff-Davis, owner of the publication for all of its life up to that point, along with Baseline.com, ChannelInsider.com, CIOInsight.com, and WebBuyersGuide.com.\n\n\"eWeek\" was started under the name \"PCWeek\" on February 28, 1984. The magazine was called \"PCWeek\" all the way up until the year 2000, during which time it covered the rise of business computing in America; as \"eWeek\", it has increased its online presence and covers more kinds of worldwide technologies.\n\n\"PCWeek\" was formed under the notion that computers could be used as business tools. The world of personal computing was changing as processing power grew exponentially. This new computational ability made computers a new and very effective business tool, and soon enough all sorts of companies were buying IBM PCs. \"PCWeek\" took advantage of this rising popularity by becoming the one stop source for all things business-computing oriented. Important members of the team that started \"PCWeek\" were John Dodge, the first news editor, Lois Paul, the first features editor, and Sam Whitmore, the first reporter who later went on to become editor-in-chief.\n\nAlthough \"PCWeek\"'s official first publication was February 28, 1984, a \"sample version\" of the magazine was available at a COMDEX convention in 1983. At the time, the concept of \"PCWeek\" was a \"radical idea\". Few saw any real need for a \"weekly news magazine about personal computers\" that was business-oriented. In addition, many magazines at the time already covered business computing, such as Datamation and Computerworld. There were also magazines dedicated to hobbyist machines, so it seemed there was no place for a weekly issue to fit in. Once the first few publications came out, it seemed like these initial suspicions had been correct. The first month of weekly issues had only 22 pages of advertising on average, well below industry standard.\n\nAfter a rocky first few months, things began to turn around. \"PCWeek\" began establishing itself as the best source for information on business computing. The magazine started breaking big stories before anyone else would. Such as news on a \"new version of the Compaq\", the \"IBM PC AT\", and the new \"Intel 80286 processor\". The magazine also provided extensive reviews for PCs capable of helping to run businesses. John Pallatto, a writer for \"PCWeek\" in its first year, produced a full \"buyer's guide\" on all DOS-compatible PCs on the market. By the end of the first year, \"PCWeek\"'s numbers had skyrocketed. The average number of advertising pages for the last month was 74.875. The publication owed its resounding success to the increasing popularity of IBM PCs, but also to their style of reporting. Sam Whitmore describes it as \"gritty, kick the door down, break your secret plans\" and says that they had \"so much fun spoiling people's days\". David Strom, the executive editor in charge of \"reviews, opinion, and analysis\" at the time identified their \"direct contact with industry leaders\" as part of why they were able to break such killer stories.\n\n\"PCWeek's\" audience was also important to their success. Early promotional publications from \"PCWeek\" show them describing their key audience as \"volume buyers\", that is, people and companies that would buy PCs in bulk for business purposes. With this the magazine was able to show big computer companies that advertising in an issue of \"PCWeek\" was the best possible way to get their product seen by the biggest and most important buyers.\n\nFollowing the turn-around success in its first couple of years, \"PCWeek\" only got better. Important people involved in between \"PCWeek's\" initial success and change to \"eWeek\" were David Strom, Sam Whitmore, Mike Edelhart, Gina Smith, Peter Coffee, Paul Bonner, and many others. The team behind the magazine was getting better and better. Jim Louderback, a lab director at \"PCWeek\" as of 1991, describes how they were able to \"get a product in on Wednesday, [review it], and have it on the front page on Monday\" and that \"that was something we were the first to do\". The publication was \"perfectly positioned\" to be the source for all information on what PCs were worth looking at for business purposes. They broke stories spoiling products from IBM, Lotus, and others as a result of incredible work by reporters like Gina Smith.\n\nLeading up to its name-change, \"PCWeek\" began building an online presence. They were one of the first magazines to do so, and they had reviews about and coverage of the emergence of the World Wide Web that were \"ahead of the game\". The switch to the name \"eWeek\" and an even greater online presence was overseen by Eric Lundquist, editor-in-chief at the time.\n\nFinally, in 2012, \"eWeek\" and other Ziff Davis assets were acquired by the company QuinStreet, which now runs many tech-oriented publications.\n\n\"PCWeek\" evolved as the whole PC Industry evolved. The early success of the IBM PC and the Visicalc and Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet programs gave \"PCWeek\" the coverage they needed to get on their feet. The magazine also developed a very active audience of people telling the team at \"PCWeek\" \"about their experiences, good and bad, as they worked with the products\". So \"PCWeek\" was also able to evolve with feedback from their active readers.\n\nIn the 21st century, business PCs have gone from \"supporting\" businesses to \"driving\" them, and there's been an increasing need for \"unbiased, expert testing of the technology\". \"eWeek\" has become much more oriented towards \"Lab-based product evaluation\" as a result of this. In terms of news, \"eWeek\" now covers all different sorts of tech, and they focus mainly on things like cloud computing, mobile technology, data center and infrastructure, security and enterprise applications, as well as IT careers and leadership information.\n\n\"eWeek\" has stated their mission as hoping to provide technology decision-makers with a mix of breaking news, analysis, trends, and reviews to help them make educated IT buying decisions.\n\n\"PCWeek\" had a key influence on the PC Industry that it covered. The magazines success contributed to the success of business PCs just as the success of business PCs contributed to the success of \"PCWeek\". Following the magazine's success, \"Anybody who had anything to do with buying PC products in a corporate environment\" sought after access to a \"PCWeek\" subscription. John Pallatto characterizes the rise of PCs in 1985 as a \"social phenomenon\", and says that \"the most sought-after status symbol on Wall Street in 1985... was the key to unlock the power switch on an IBM PC AT\". It is also said that \"in those early days\", \"PCWeek\" could help make a small startup \"PC maker\" or \"software developer\" successful with only \"a few column inches of editorial\".\n\nThe stories \"PCWeek\" covered were also important, and ended up having noticeable effects on the industry. Each issue would break stories that would completely spoil the secret plans of some big tech company, resulting in faster adoption of new technologies as information was spread about them before they were even out. One story from \"PCWeek\" that is well known is their coverage of \"the famous 1994 flaw in the numerical processor in Intel's Pentium chip\". The news they broke on Intel's processor, along with other research, cause Intel to actually pull back and fix their chips before offering new ones. Another famous part of \"PCWeek\" was the fictional gossip columnist by the name of \"Spencer F. Katt\". The column would cover all sorts of rumors and gossip about the PC Industry, and the character of Spencer F. Katt became a famous icon of the entire world of computing.\n"}

Sinclair had acted as Secretary of State for Air during World War II and could not spend much time in his constituency, Britain's northernmost mainland seat. \n\nGandar Dower had based his 1945 election platform on serving as a wartime MP until the end of the conflict with Japan. His election address stated, \"If I am returned I shall resign when Japan is beaten and stand again at the by-election which will follow, so that you can decide whether you wish me to continue as your representative in peace\" and followed this up with an eve-of-poll \"special message\" stating, \"Note - Gandar Dower, if elected, has pledged himself to resign at the end of the Japanese war and to stand again at the resultant by-election.\"\"\n\nIn his victory speech at the declaration, he said, \"Don't regard me as a Unionist.

Backed by the unanimous support of both associations, Mr. E.L. Gandar Dower, the Conservative MP for Caithness and Sutherland, will hold his seat probably until the next General Election.\"\n\nAt a 15 September 1948 meeting of his local Conservative Association, he attempted to bring matters to a head by calling on the association to renominate him as the Conservative candidate for a by-election that he now intended to trigger. He was overwhelmingly defeated, with only 8 members voting for him to follow through with this course of action and numerous members expressing their dissatisfaction. In response to this, he declared that he would be standing at the next general election as an Independent, and from 3 October 1948, he withdrew from the Conservative whip. On 12 December 1948, the Caithness and Sutherland Conservatives selected David Robertson to replace Gandar Dower.

Lauder’s family fled Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938, using their household silver to get visas to Belgium. They then moved on to England where her mother was sent to an internment camp on the Isle of Man and Evelyn was placed in a nursery. The family arrived in New York City in 1940. Lauder would later recall that she was asleep when the ship bringing them to the United States arrived in New York Harbor and her mother woke her up to see the Statue of Liberty. During the war years her father worked as a diamond cutter; then the family opened the first of what became a chain of five dress shops in Manhattan.\n\nShe graduated from Hunter College High School in 1954. She then attended Hunter College, part of the City University of New York, where she studied Psychology and Anthropology and also where she met her future husband, Leonard Lauder, then a trainee naval officer, on a blind date. She graduated from Hunter College in 1958. The couple were married on July 5, 1959. After the marriage, she worked for several years as a public school teacher in Harlem before leaving to work with her husband at the company founded in 1946 by her mother-in-law, Estée Lauder, which at the time sold six products: a red lipstick, creams, lotions, and Youth Dew fragrance in a bath oil.\n\nLauder was the Senior Corporate Vice President of the Estée Lauder Companies and a member of the board of overseers at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. A\n1995 profile in \"The New York Times\" called her \"an immaculately turned-out, awesomely organized woman\" who had started to fill the public role that had been filled by her mother-in-law, Estée Lauder.\n\nLauder, an executive at Estée Lauder, created the Clinique brand name and developed its product line. She worked as the training director for Clinique and was the first person to wear the trademark white lab coat, now worn by Clinique salespeople at cosmetic departments worldwide.\n\nLauder personally raised much of the $13.6 million that went to create the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which opened in October 1992 and focuses on the treatment and diagnosis of breast cancer. She helped raise an additional $5 million to create an endowment to be used to fund clinical research there.\n\n\"Self\" magazine's first annual issue for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month came after an April 1991 lunch at the 21 Club, at which Lauder discussed ideas for articles about breast cancer with her friend Alexandra Penney, who was then serving as editor of \"Self\".\n\nTogether with Penney, Lauder established The Breast Cancer Research Foundation and formalized the pink ribbon as a symbol for breast cancer awareness as part of \"Self\" magazine's second annual Breast Cancer Awareness Month issue in 1992. Penney's inspiration to improve on the success of the magazine's first annual issue was to create a ribbon that would be placed in Estee Lauder's New York City stores. Lauder made the commitment to have the ribbons placed on the company's cosmetics counters across the United States.\n\nBy 1993, Lauder had overseen the creation of a new shade called Pink Ribbon that was part of her personal and corporate effort to raise breast cancer awareness. Her husband paid for the cost of registering The Breast Cancer Research Foundation in all 50 states. By the start of 1995, some $900,000 had been raised for the foundation, including $120,000 from the sale of Pink Ribbon lipstick and blusher and $190,000 from the sale of the Clinique Berry Kiss pink lipstick.\n\nBy October 2008, the Estée Lauder Companies estimated that the firm's Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign had raised $335 million towards research and distributed 80 million pink ribbons.\n\nFollowing Lauder's death, Delta Air Lines, which had already dedicated one of its Boeing 767-400ER long-haul planes in honor of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation that Lauder founded and painted it in a pink livery while Lauder was living, re-christened and renamed the same plane in her memory.\n\nShe was married to Leonard Lauder, former Chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies, from 1959 until her death.

He is remembered for having founded the sports prize Egebergs Ærespris, which was regarded as the highest achievement in Norwegian sport.\n\nEgeberg was born in Moss in Østfold, Norway. He was the son of merchant Peder Cappelen Egeberg and Hanna Wilhelmine Scheel. He was a brother of Einar Westye Egeberg, Sr. and a grandson of Westye Egeberg.\n\nHe married Lucy Parr in 1876. Their son Westye Parr Egeberg was a notable landowner. Through their daughter Esther Lucy Egeberg he was grandfather of painter and writer Ferdinand Finne. He died in Tolga in 1921, aged 78.\n\nEgeberg was a naval officer from 1863, and served in the British Royal Navy from 1865. He was first lieutenant à la suite from 1874, and discharged in 1875. Together with his brother Einar, he took over his family's Christiania-based timber company Westye Egeberg & Co in 1874, after the death of their father. He was an associate from 1879. He served as Cabinet Chamberlain () for Oscar II of Sweden from 1887 to 1905.\n\nEgeberg was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1891. He was a Commander, First Class of the Danish Order of the Dannebrog, Knight Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy, Officer of the French Légion d'honneur, Commander of the Spanish Order of Charles III, Knight Grand Officer of the Spanish Order of Isabella the Catholic and the Swedish Order of the Polar Star, and recipient of \nKing Oscar II's Anniversary Medal.\n\nUpon his 75th birthday in 1917, Egeberg donated to the sports association Norges Riksforbund for Idræt. The donation was basis for the sports prize \"Kabinetskammerherre Egebergs ærespris for alsidig idrett\". According to the original statutes approved in 1920, the fund's interests should be used for a stauette given to a sportsperson who, during the last two years, had excelled in one sport and also showed eminent performances in another, completely different sport. Egeberg also funded a design competition for the trophy, won by sculptor Magnus Vigrestad. The statuette became regarded as the highest achievement in Norwegian sport at the time. The first prize was awarded for 1918.\n\nThe statutes have changed slightly over the years. Today the prize is awarded by the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, and given to Norwegian sports people who have excelled nationally in at least two sports, and excelled internationally in at least one of these.\n\n"}

{"id": "47245105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47245105", "title": "Fund governance", "text": "Fund governance\n\nFund governance refers to a system of checks and balances and work performed by the governing body (board) of an investment fund to ensure that the fund is operated in the best interests of the fund and its investors. The objective of fund governance is to uphold the regulatory principles commonly known as the four pillars of investor protection that are typically promulgated through the investment fund regulation applicable in the jurisdiction of the fund. These principles vary by jurisdiction and in the US, the 1940 Act generally ensure that: (i) The investment fund will be managed in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives, (ii) The assets of the investment fund will be kept safe, (iii) When investors redeem they will get their pro rata share of the investment fund’s assets, (iv) The investment fund will be managed for the benefit of the fund’s shareholders and not its service providers.\n\nOffshore investment funds are typically formed as companies in the Cayman Islands (85%). When an investment fund is formed as a company, its governing body is its board of directors. In this context, fund governance is commonly referred to as “fund directorships” or “independent director services”. Offshore funds are commonly structured as a “feeder” funds that will generally invest all monies received directly into a “master” fund.\n\nOnshore investment fund are typically formed as limited partnerships (LPs) in the United States, most commonly in Delaware. These funds typically serve as the “master” fund to the offshore feeder fund. The governing body (board) of the LP is its general partner (GP) which is usually under the sole control and direction of the investment manager or fund sponsor. This structure is increasingly being challenged by institutional investors and other stakeholders to implement more independent governance and investor friendly mechanisms typically in the form of advisory boards or independent GPs or managing members.\n\nInvestment funds can also be formed as unit trusts with a board of trustees as its governing body.\n\nThe role of fund governance comprises both fiduciary duties and responsibilities owed by the governing body (board).\nFiduciary duties are prescribed by the applicable laws of the fund’s jurisdiction and are inviolable. Responsibilities are prescribed through contractual terms in the various fund documents. Fund governance responsibilities can vary widely between investment funds because fund documents are commonly negotiated between fund stakeholders based on their various (often competing) requirements and objectives. Although the objective of fund governance is investor protection, fiduciary duties typically require the board to act in the best interest of a fund taken as whole and not any particular investor.\n\nFund governance is often conflated with corporate governance. Although some principles and practices appear similar, there are important differences. Most notably:\n\nNot all funds are formed as corporations and the legal form of the fund structure does not remove the need for sound fund governance.\n\nUnlike corporations, investment funds typically don't have any employees to manage or lead. Corporate directors have more authority and a more complex set of duties to execute, such as approving major corporate investment and financial policies, monitoring diverse accounting systems, and selecting and terminating top corporate executives. Compared to hedge funds, the regulatory and competitive issues facing each company are highly idiosyncratic. Investment funds operate by appointing service providers under service agreements with the fund and each service provider is governed by its own governing body independently of the fund. This means that fund directors do not have any authority to direct the affairs of the service providers to the fund other than under the contractual responsibilities outlined in the service agreement. Day-to-day managerial responsibilities are typically delegated to the investment manager and fund administrator. Compared to large corporations, hedge funds are relatively homogenous, and the duties of their directors are relatively limited and standardized. These factors should reduce the required time investment and increase the scalability of the director's human capital such that it can be employed efficiently across many funds.\n\nCorporations offer their shares publicly and widely typically with no qualification requirements. Funds offer their shares privately on a restricted basis to sophisticated investors.\n\nCorporations don’t have a rulebook (like an offering memorandum) or delegated structure so corporate directors are responsible for formulating and implementing strategy to ensure the success of the corporation. Corporate directors have a dual role of adviser and monitor, but this is not the case in a fund. Fund directors typically serve as a monitor since the fund is usually formed to pursue the investment objective defined by the investment manager as negotiated and agreed in the fund documents by its various stakeholders. Fund directors will typically not have any responsibility for the investment strategy as the investment manager is not an employee of the fund unlike the CEO in a corporation. Thus, “the advisory role of hedge fund directors is limited when compared to that of corporate directors. For example, hedge fund directors do not advise the manager on portfolio strategy or security selection.\n\nFund governance became a major fund servicing industry following the 2008 financial crisis “spurred (by) several media reports arguing that professional directors must be too busy to provide the appropriate level of monitoring for their clients.” Consequently, many fund governance firms proliferated in response to perceived demand for independent directors for hedge funds and the low barriers to entry evident in the industry. A ‘gold rush’ mentality developed worldwide after articles by the Financial Times and the New York Times sensationalized fund directors in the Cayman Islands as having ‘hundreds’ of directorships. Serving as a fund director was portrayed as a sinecure because anyone, anywhere in the world, could serve as a director on a Cayman Islands mutual fund (the FT articles were later critiqued by the \"Columbia Journalism Review\"). In response to this critical media scrutiny, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority implemented a number of reforms under the Director Registration and Licensing Law, 2014 which required all directors of Cayman Islands regulated mutual funds to become regulated. As of 31 May 2015, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority reported that there were 8,879 directors on Cayman Islands funds of which only 422 were based in the Cayman Islands.\n\nFund governance providers range from limited-resourced, proprietorships of part-time directors (or so-called ‘boutique’ firms) to fully resourced professional services firms of full-time directors, “organized similarly to large law or accounting firms”. In many parts of the world, serving as a fund director remains a cottage industry where proponents argue that fund governance is different from the other services provided to the fund and not adaptable to the professional firm approach. This mindset appears to be supported by the law in several jurisdictions that mandate that only “natural persons” provide director services. Opponents of the proprietor approach argue that boards should not be “dominated by part-timers at a time when they need to be vigilant about avoiding future crises” and that professional funds “would never buy legal services or management advice from people only willing to spare a few hours a month”.\n\nProfessional fund governance firms are also referred to as Board Service Providers (BSPs). Proponents argue that directors are independent service providers to a fund equivalent to its auditors, administrators and attorneys, all of whom use a professional firm approach and the same professional standards and expectations should also apply to fund governance. In the U.K. all professional investment funds are required by law to appoint a BSP as an Authorised Corporate Director. In the United States of America, BSPs are not required by law, but the SEC does “require funds to explicitly authorize the independent directors to hire employees and to retain advisers and experts necessary to carry out their duties”\n\nPost-financial crisis and several spectacular fund governance failures, there has been much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the Stanford Law Review, University of Kentucky and University of Cambridge among many others. Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue “we know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole proprietorship, and for good reason. Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons\".\n\nEmpirical and anecdotal evidence from other fund services providers such as legal, administration and audit also supports the professional firm approach and it continues to dominate the professional fund industry. As such professional fund governance firms have the “economies of scale to attract the best board members, introduce more rigorous training programs and develop the best proprietary knowledge” plus economies of scale and scope allow firms to increase quality and/or lower cost by finding efficiencies in production, spreading fixed costs across a larger asset base and investing in technology. Independent researchers further argue that BSPs bring “collective expertise, from the ability to process huge quantities of information to specialist advice” use the power of technology for business intelligence, process management and information access to make fast and accurate decisions.\n\nThe Bear Stearns case is widely regarded as the seminal case of legal counsel conflicts among hedge fund directors. Investors in the funds lost approximately $1.6 billion and “the two supposedly independent directors appointed by Walkers to serve Cioffi’s two hedge funds were Scott Lennon and Michelle Wilson-Clarke” were found by the Cayman Islands court to be conflicted as they were employees of an affiliate of Walkers. In his judgment the Chief Justice of the Cayman Islands said “For reasons which I need not elaborate now (but would be prepared to if asked), I am led to an irresistible impression that the manner of the conduct of the directors, trustee and the lawyers advising them” — all Walkers employees — “over the resolutions for winding up was clandestine and suspicious and was certainly in breach of the strict prohibition — against such a resolution being taken during the pendancy of the investors’ petition for the removal of the directors.\"\n\nDuring the 1980s, Sark was notorious for the emergence of the so-called “nominee director” practice i.e. where the director is in name only and does not exercise his judgment independently but rather acts like an automaton under the control of another person. \nThe most infamous example was in 1999, when Guinness world record holder and Sark resident Phil Crowshaw was found to have singlehandedly held 3,378 directorships registered in Sark, 1,312 registered directorships in England and more than 2,000 directorships registered in Dublin and Isle of Man. He was later disqualified as a director by courts in Guernsey and the U.K. yet he was only one of “a group of residents who between them held directorships of thousands of companies scattered far and wide”. These individuals were engaged in “the totally unacceptable practice of renting out their names as company directors without any real knowledge of what the companies are up to.” \nIn response Jack Straw, the Home Secretary commissioned Andrew Edwards, former UK Treasury director to investigate these practices among Britain’s offshore dependencies. In 1998, the Edwards report called for various reforms including that “Guernsey, Alderney and Sark should introduce a system of licensing and registering directors and bring in a code of conduct governing the standards expected from directors and trustees.” The Edwards report “also called for a limit to be set on the number of directorships held by individuals, suggesting a ceiling of five trading companies or 30 asset-holding (fund) companies”. The Sark Lark ignited the debate about director capacity and the backlash against independent directors in offshore jurisdictions. It was the genesis of the now discredited notion that caps on directorships would improve director performance or the number of directorships held is a proxy for director performance. Several jurisdictions arbitrarily introduced caps on director capacity based on the Edwards report. However, as recently as November, 2012, BBC reported that the Sark Lark was still thriving.\n\nThe Weavering case was widely regarded as the seminal case on hedge fund directors’ duties and responsibilities. The Weavering Macro Fixed Income Fund Limited was listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and its directors Stefan Peterson and Hans Ekstrom were considered independent and in good standing under the Irish Stock Exchange standards. However, they were later found guilty by a Cayman Islands Court of being negligent in carrying out their fiduciary duties, and were held liable for US $111 million in damages. The case was reversed on appeal and currently pending appeal to the Privy Council. The Weavering Capital Scandal became notorious because the Managing Director of the UK Management Company, Magnus Peterson, was jailed for 13 years on 8 counts of Fraud in 2015 and the discovery that he had illegally used investors money to fund personal projects such as the \"Grey Wolf (Film)\".\n\nSuccessful fund governance firms have been criticized by their competitors in ‘boutique’ firms for having too many directorships or being “rubber stamp” directors. However, independent empirical research has consistently revealed these allegations as counterfactual. Some studies have used the number of directorships held by a director as a proxy for the reputational capital of the director - arguing that reputational incentives are particularly pronounced for professional hedge fund directors, and that directors who sit on more boards and the boards of better performing funds should be of higher quality. Thus, hiring a director who can be credibly perceived as being more independent could provide valuable certification for the fund. Busy professional directors are more common among funds that derive higher benefits from external certification and monitoring, and their departure from the board is associated with outflows of investor capital. This result is inconsistent with directors serving as uninformative (or most nefariously, pro-management) rubber-stamps and inconsistent with the theory that funds prefer rubber-stamp directors who face more time constraints, making them too busy to monitor the manager.\n\nAn inordinate amount of scrutiny has been placed on issue of board capacity and composition to improve board performance, but those factors may become irrelevant to boards acting in the best interests of investors if the voting shares are held by the manager. If a serious conflict arises with the manager the degree to which the board can effectively act in the best interests of the fund can be neutralized in these circumstances. The voting shares give the manager complete discretion over the appointment and removal of directors; therefore controlling board composition and the ability to veto any of its decisions. If the investment manager is dissatisfied with any decision, he can simply exercise his right to remove the director(s) and replace them with someone more amendable to the manager’s wishes.\n\nThe board requires has the right mix of skills, talent and capacity to function effectively. Proprietors and boutique firms by definition have limited resources and – by design – do not invest the time or money required to deliver the full range of resources provided by professional firms. As the large fund governance firms become more dominant, it has become common for proprietors and other boutique firms to band together, pooling their resources to create a larger ‘virtual’ or ‘pseudo’ professional firm to offer greater scale and selection to compete with the large professional firms. These alliances are commonly marketed as ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards. However, these loose arrangements often lack the operating discipline and reputational investment of their large professional firm counterparts. In fact, the arrangements create co-dependency for business referrals and actually create higher complexity and potential for conflicts of interests since and they are entered into primarily for commercial reasons, and not to act in the best interests of the fund. It is not uncommon for these arrangements to result in a high level of duplication and dysfunction.\n\nAll directors owe the same fiduciary duties and directors each have joint and several liability so in reality ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards is a marketing aphorism and distinction without a difference. Independent research has found that professional firms of quality directors have large reputational investment with high incentive to perform well and consistently outperform proprietorships. This research found that “directors from a top ten firm are almost twice as likely as directors from smaller firms to obtain a new directorship.” This implies that directors are even more likely to be hired when their firm has a larger client base, and thus more reputational capital to protect. The single firm focus is counterfactual to the risk analysis. Unquestionably the area of greatest risk within any fund is within its investment portfolio. Enormous authority over the fund affairs is often entrusted to the investment manager as a single individual, from a single firm, yet it would be universally accepted to be counterproductive and inefficient to appoint another manager from a different firm to manage the same portfolio at the same time, or another auditor from different firm to audit the same fund at the same time. It is not obvious, other than the aforementioned marketing reason, why any one believes that appointing directors from different firms is an effective mechanism for eliciting independent judgment and deliberation than those doing the deciding work for a (single) firm instead.\n\nBoards are small organizations but like all organizations they need effective leadership to succeed. The SEC recommends fund boards to appoint a lead director and it has become an industry leading practice for many fund boards to appoint a lead director to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the board. The lead director may schedule, set and prioritize board meeting agendas and make sure the board receives reports from management on essential matters. The lead director may also be the chief contact for the board’s counsel or the fund's auditors (or other service providers). If the lead director is an independent director, he or she may represent the other independent directors in discussions with the fund management. SEC also recommends directors employ staff.\n\n"}

Such raids can also expose enemy defensive weaknesses and achieve a psychological effect on the enemy's morale.\n\nHit-and-run tactics are used in guerrilla warfare, militant resistance movements, and terrorism where the enemy typically overmatches the attacking force to the point where sustained combat is to be avoided. However, the tactics can also be used as part of more conventional warfare. Examples of the latter include commando or other special forces attacks or sorties from a besieged castle. Hit-and-run tactics were also where the lightly armed and nearly unarmored horse archers typical of the Eurasian steppe peoples excelled. This holds especially true for such troops that were not part of a large army (such as scouting parties), but it was not unusual to see them employed in such a way even as part of a major force.\n\nThe Seljuk victory over the Byzantine Empire at the Battle of Manzikert was preceded by hit-and-run attacks of Seljuk cavalry which threw the Byzantine army into confusion, which proved fatal once it started to retreat. Similarly, the earlier Parthian and Sassanid Persian horse archers paved the way for their cataphracts' attack that achieved the decisive victories at the Battle of Carrhae and Battle of Edessa. The use of hit-and-run tactics dates back even earlier to the nomadic Scythians of Central Asia, who employed them against Darius the Great's Persian Achaemenid Empire and later against Alexander the Great's Macedonian Empire. The Arab general Baibars also successfully used hit-and-run during the battle of Ain Jalut, the first defeat of the quickly expanding Mongol Empire. Vastly outnumbered in North America, the French made effective use of hit-and-run raids during the various French and Indian Wars. In the Turkish War of Independence, Turks fought against the Greek Army by hit-and-run tactics before a regular army was set up.\n\nIn the Vietnam War, Viet Cong forces used hit-and-run tactics to great effectiveness against anti-communist military forces. It has also been used in Afghanistan by rebel forces during the Soviet–Afghan War. Various Iraqi insurgent groups have also used hit-and-run tactics as part of their tactics against Iraqi security forces and American-led coalition forces in Iraq. Improvised fighting vehicles called \"technicals\" are often used in such operations.\n\nThe term \"hit-and-run\" is also used in economics to describe a firm that enters a market to take advantage of abnormal profits and then leave. These tactics can be seen in a contestable market.\n\n\n"}

Following his funeral, she and her children largely withdrew from public view. In 1968, she married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. Following Aristotle Onassis's death in 1975, she had a career as a publishing editor in New York City. She died on May 19, 1994 of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, aged 64.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Jacqueline Kennedy was regarded as an international fashion icon. Her famous ensemble of a pink Chanel suit and matching pillbox hat has become a symbol of her husband's assassination. Even after her death, she ranks as one of the most popular and recognizable First Ladies and was listed as one of Gallup's Most-Admired Men and Women of the 20th century in 1999.\n\nJacqueline Lee Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, New York, to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernou \"Black Jack\" Bouvier III and socialite Janet Norton Lee. Bouvier's mother was of Irish descent, and her father had French, Scottish, and English ancestry.\nNamed after her father, Bouvier was baptized at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in Manhattan; she was raised in the Catholic faith. Her sister Lee was born in 1933.\n\nBouvier spent her early childhood years in Manhattan and at Lasata, the Bouviers' country estate in East Hampton on Long Island. She idolized her father, who likewise favored her over her sister, calling his elder child \"the most beautiful daughter a man ever had\". Biographer Tina Flaherty pointed out Jackie's early confidence in herself, seeing a link to her father's praise and positive attitude to her, and her sister Lee has stated that she would not have gained her \"independence and individuality\" had it not been for the relationship she had with their father and paternal grandfather. From an early age, Bouvier was an enthusiastic equestrienne and successfully competed in the sport; horse-riding would remain a lifelong passion. She also took ballet lessons, was an avid reader, and excelled at learning languages, with French being particularly emphasized in her upbringing.\n\nIn 1935, Bouvier was enrolled in Manhattan's Chapin School, which she attended for grades 1–6. She was a bright student but often misbehaved; one of her teachers described her as \"a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil\". Bouvier's mother attributed her daughter's behavior to the way that she finished her assignments ahead of classmates and then acted out in boredom. Her behavior improved after the headmistress warned her that none of her positive qualities would matter if she did not behave.\n\nThe marriage of Bouvier's parents was strained by her father's alcoholism and extramarital affairs; the family had also struggled with financial difficulties following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. They separated in 1936 and divorced four years later, with the press publishing intimate details of the split. According to her cousin John H. Davis, Bouvier was deeply affected by the divorce and subsequently had a \"tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own\". When her mother married Standard Oil heir Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr., Bouvier and her sister did not attend the ceremony, because it was arranged quickly and travel was restricted due to World War II. Bouvier gained three step-siblings from Auchincloss' two previous marriages, Hugh \"Yusha\" Auchincloss III, Thomas Gore Auchincloss, and Nina Gore Auchincloss; she formed the closest bond with Yusha, who became one of her most trusted confidants. The marriage later produced two more children, Janet Jennings Auchincloss in 1945 and James Lee Auchincloss in 1947.\n\nAfter the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood estate in McLean, Virginia, became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, although they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, and in their father's homes in New York City and Long Island. Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she never would have experienced otherwise. While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic as well as being a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.\n\nAfter six years at Chapin, Bouvier attended the Holton-Arms School in Northwest Washington, D.C. from 1942 to 1944, and Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, from 1944 to 1947. She chose Miss Porter's because it was a boarding school that allowed her to distance herself from the Auchinclosses, and because the school placed an emphasis on college preparatory classes. In her senior class yearbook, Bouvier was acknowledged for \"her wit, her accomplishment as a horsewoman, and her unwillingness to become a housewife\". Jacqueline later hired her childhood friend Nancy Tuckerman to be her Social Secretary at the White House. She graduated among the top students of her class and received the Maria McKinney Memorial Award for Excellence in Literature.\n\nIn the fall of 1947, Bouvier entered Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. She had wanted to attend Sarah Lawrence College, closer to New York City, but her parents insisted that she choose the more geographically isolated Vassar. Bouvier was an accomplished student who participated in the school's art and drama clubs and wrote for its newspaper. Due to her dislike for the college, she did not take an active part in its social life and instead traveled back to Manhattan on the weekends. She had made her society debut in the summer before entering college and became a frequent presence in New York social functions. Hearst columnist Igor Cassini dubbed her the \"debutante of the year\". Bouvier spent her junior year (1949–1950) in France—at the University of Grenoble in Grenoble, and at the Sorbonne in Paris—in a study-abroad program through Smith College. Upon returning home, she transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in French literature in 1951. During the early years of her marriage to John F. Kennedy, she took continuing education classes in American history at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile attending George Washington, Bouvier won a twelve-month junior editorship at \"Vogue\" magazine; she had been selected over several hundred other women nationwide. The position entailed working for six months in the magazine's New York City office and spending the remaining six months in Paris. Before beginning the job, Bouvier celebrated her college graduation and her sister Lee's high school graduation by traveling with her to Europe for the summer. The trip was the subject of her only autobiography, \"One Special Summer\", co-authored with Lee; it is also the only one of her published works to feature Jacqueline's drawings. On her first day at \"Vogue\", the managing editor advised her to quit and go back to Washington. According to biographer Barbara Leaming, the editor was concerned about Bouvier's marriage prospects; she was 22 years of age and was considered too old to be single in her social circles. Bouvier followed the advice, left the job and returned to Washington after only one day of work.\n\nBouvier moved back to Merrywood and was hired as a part-time receptionist at the \"Washington Times-Herald\". A week later, she approached editor Frank Waldrop and requested more challenging work; she was given the position of \"Inquiring Camera Girl\", despite Waldrop's initial concerns about her competence. The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures for publication in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses. In addition to the random \"man on the street\" vignettes, she sometimes sought interviews with people of interest, such as six-year-old Tricia Nixon. Bouvier interviewed Tricia a few days after her father Richard Nixon was elected to the vice presidency in the 1952 election. During this time, Bouvier was also briefly engaged to a young stockbroker, John G. W. Husted, Jr. After only a month of dating, the couple published the announcement in \"The New York Times\" in January 1952. She called off the engagement after three months, because she had found him \"immature and boring\" once she got to know him better.\n\nBouvier and U.S. Representative John F. Kennedy belonged to the same social circle and were formally introduced by a mutual friend, journalist Charles L. Bartlett, at a dinner party in May 1952. Bouvier was attracted to Kennedy's physical appearance, charm, wit and wealth. The pair also shared the similarities of Catholicism, writing, enjoying reading and having previously lived abroad. Kennedy was busy running for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts; the relationship grew more serious and he proposed to her after the November election. Bouvier took some time to accept, because she had been assigned to cover the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London for \"The Washington Times-Herald\". After a month in Europe, she returned to the United States and accepted Kennedy's marriage proposal. She then resigned from her position at the newspaper. Their engagement was officially announced on June 25, 1953.\n\nBouvier and Kennedy were married on September 12, 1953, at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island, in a mass celebrated by Boston's Archbishop Richard Cushing. The wedding was considered the social event of the season with an estimated 700 guests at the ceremony and 1200 at the reception that followed at Hammersmith Farm. The wedding dress, now housed in the Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts, and the dresses of her attendants were created by designer Ann Lowe of New York City.\nThe newlyweds honeymooned in Acapulco, Mexico, before settling in their new home, Hickory Hill in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Kennedy developed a warm relationship with her in-laws, Joseph and Rose Kennedy. In the early years of their marriage, the couple faced several personal setbacks. John Kennedy suffered from Addison's Disease and from chronic and at times debilitating back pain, which had been exacerbated by a war injury; in late 1954, he underwent a near-fatal spinal operation. Additionally, Jacqueline suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and in August 1956 gave birth to a stillborn daughter, Arabella. They subsequently sold their Hickory Hill estate to John's brother Robert, who occupied it with his wife Ethel and their growing family, and bought a townhouse on N Street in Georgetown.\n\nJacqueline gave birth to a daughter Caroline on November 27, 1957. At the time, she and John Kennedy were campaigning for his re-election to the Senate, and they posed with their infant daughter for the cover of the April 21, 1958 issue of \"Life Magazine\". They traveled together during the campaign, trying to narrow the geographical gap between them that had persisted for the first five years of the marriage. Soon enough, John Kennedy started to notice the value that his wife added to his congressional campaign. Kenneth O'Donnell remembered that \"the size of the crowd was twice as big\" when she accompanied her husband; he also recalled her as \"always cheerful and obliging\". John's mother Rose observed Jacqueline as not being \"a natural-born campaigner\" due to her shyness and being uncomfortable with too much attention. In November 1958, John Kennedy was reelected to a second term. He credited Jacqueline's visibility in both ads and stumping as vital assets in securing his victory, and he called her \"simply invaluable\".\n\nIn July 1959, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger visited the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port and had his first conversation with Jacqueline; he found her to have \"tremendous awareness, an all-seeing eye and a ruthless judgment\". That year, Jack Kennedy traveled to 14 states, with Jacqueline taking long breaks from the trips so she could spend time with their daughter Caroline. She also counseled her husband on improving his wardrobe in preparation for his intended presidential campaign the following year. In particular, she traveled to Louisiana to visit Edmund Reggie and to help her husband garner support in the state for his presidential bid.\n\nOn January 3, 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency and launched his campaign nationwide. In the early months of the election year, Jacqueline Kennedy accompanied her husband to campaign events such as whistle-stops and dinners. Shortly after the campaign began, she became pregnant and decided to stay at home in Georgetown due to her previous high-risk pregnancies. Kennedy subsequently participated in the campaign by writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, \"Campaign Wife\", answering correspondence, and giving interviews to the media.\n\nDespite not participating on the campaign trail, Jacqueline became the subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices. On one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women's magazines alongside film stars and named as one of the 12 best-dressed women of the world. On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press. In order to downplay her wealthy background, Jacqueline stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.\n\nOn July 13 at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, the Democratic Party nominated John Kennedy for President of the United States. Jacqueline did not attend the nomination due to her pregnancy, which had been publicly announced ten days earlier. From Hyannis Port, she watched the September 26, 1960 debate—which was the nation's first televised presidential debate—between her husband and Republican candidate Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent Vice President. Marian Cannon, the wife of Arthur Schlesinger, watched the debate with her. Days after the debates, Jacqueline contacted Schlesinger and informed him that John wanted his aid along with that of John Kenneth Galbraith in preparing for the third debate on October 13; she wished for them to give her husband new ideas and speeches. On September 29, 1960, the Kennedys appeared together for a joint interview on \"Person to Person\", interviewed by Charles Collingwood.\n\nOn November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon in the U.S. presidential election. A little over two weeks later on November 25, Jacqueline gave birth to the couple's first son, John F. Kennedy, Jr.. She spent two weeks recovering in the hospital, during which the most minute details of both her and her son's conditions were reported by the media in what has been considered the first instance of national interest in the Kennedy family.\n\nHer husband was sworn in as president on January 20, 1961. As a presidential couple, the Kennedys differed from the Eisenhowers by their political affiliation, youth, and their relationship with the media. Historian Gil Troy has noted that in particular, they \"emphasized vague appearances rather than specific accomplishments or passionate commitments\" and therefore fit in well in the early 1960s' \"cool, TV-oriented culture\". The discussion about Jacqueline's fashion choices continued during her years in the White House, and she became a trendsetter, hiring American designer Oleg Cassini to design her wardrobe. She was the first presidential wife to hire a press secretary, Pamela Turnure, and carefully managed her contact with the media, usually shying away from making public statements, and strictly controlling the extent to which her children were photographed. Kennedy was portrayed by the media as the ideal woman, leading academic Maurine Beasley to observe that she \"created an unrealistic media expectation for first ladies that would challenge her successors\". Nevertheless, the First Lady attracted worldwide positive public attention and gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its Cold War policies.\n\nAlthough Jacqueline stated that her priority as a First Lady was to take care of the President and their children, she also dedicated her time to the promotion of American arts and preservation of its history. The restoration of the White House was her main contribution, but she also furthered the cause by hosting social events that brought together elite figures from politics and the arts. One of her unrealized goals was to found a Department of the Arts, but she did contribute to the establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, established during Johnson's tenure.\n\nJacqueline had visited the White House on two occasions before she became First Lady, the first time as a grade-school tourist in 1941 and again as the guest of Mamie Eisenhower shortly before her husband's inauguration. She was dismayed to find that the mansion's rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that displayed little historical significance and made it her first major project as First Lady to restore its historical character. On her first day in residence, she began her efforts with the help of interior decorator Sister Parish. She decided to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life by adding a kitchen on the family floor and new rooms for her children. The $50,000 that had been appropriated for this effort was almost immediately exhausted. Continuing the project, she established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and solicited the advice of early American furniture expert Henry du Pont. To solve the funding problem, a White House guidebook was published, sales of which were used for the restoration. Working with Rachel Lambert Mellon, Kennedy also oversaw the redesign and replanting of the White House Rose Garden and the East Garden, which was renamed the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden after her husband's assassination. In addition, Kennedy helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., because she felt these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history. \nPrior to Kennedy's years as First Lady, furnishings and other items had been taken from the White House by presidents and their families when they departed; this led to the lack of original historical pieces in the mansion. To track down these missing furnishings and other historical pieces of interest, she personally wrote to possible donors. She also initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the Smithsonian Institution, rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own, and founded the White House Historical Association, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, the position of a permanent Curator of the White House, the White House Endowment Trust, and the White House Acquisition Trust. She was the first presidential spouse to hire a White House curator.\n\nOn February 14, 1962, Jacqueline took American television viewers on a tour of the White House with Charles Collingwood of CBS News. In the tour she stated that \"I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important ... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best.\" The film was watched by 56 million television viewers in the United States, and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Trustees Award for it at the Emmy Awards in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by Lady Bird Johnson. Kennedy was the only First Lady to win an Emmy.\nThroughout her husband's presidency, Kennedy made many official visits to other countries, on her own or with the President—more than any of the preceding First Ladies. Despite the initial worry that she might not have \"political appeal\", she proved popular among international dignitaries. Before the Kennedys' first official visit to France in 1961, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn. After arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak French, as well as her extensive knowledge of French history. At the conclusion of the visit, \"Time\" magazine seemed delighted with the First Lady and noted, \"There was also that fellow who came with her.\" Even President Kennedy joked, \"I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris – and I have enjoyed it!\"\n\nFrom France, the Kennedys traveled to Vienna, Austria, where Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, when asked to shake the President's hand for a photo, stated, \"I'd like to shake her hand first.\" Khrushchev later sent her a puppy, significant for being the offspring of Strelka, the dog that had gone to space during a Soviet space mission.\n\nAt the urging of U.S. Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith, Kennedy undertook a tour of India and Pakistan with her sister Lee Radziwill in 1962, which was amply documented in photojournalism of the time as well as in Galbraith's journals and memoirs. She was gifted with a horse called Sardar by the President of Pakistan, Ayub Khan, as he had found out on his visit to the White House that he and the First Lady had a common interest in horses. \"Life\" magazine correspondent Anne Chamberlin wrote that Kennedy \"conducted herself magnificently\" although noting that her crowds were smaller than those that President Dwight Eisenhower and Queen Elizabeth II attracted when they had previously visited these countries. In addition to these well-publicized trips during the three years of the Kennedy administration, she traveled to countries including Afghanistan, Austria, Canada, Colombia, United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Morocco, Turkey, and Venezuela. Unlike her husband, Kennedy was fluent in Spanish, which she used to address Latin American audiences.\n\nIn early 1963, Jacqueline was again pregnant, which led her to curtail her official duties. She spent most of the summer at a home she and the President had rented on Squaw Island, which was near the Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. On August 7 (five weeks ahead of her scheduled due date), she went into labor and gave birth to a boy, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, via emergency Caesarean section at nearby Otis Air Force Base. The infant's lungs were not fully developed, and he was transferred from Cape Cod to Boston Children's Hospital, where he died of hyaline membrane disease two days after birth. Jacqueline had remained at Otis Air Force Base to recuperate after the Caesarean delivery; her husband went to Boston to be with their infant son and was present when he died. On August 14, the President returned to Otis to take her home and gave an impromptu speech to thank nurses and airmen who had gathered in her suite. In appreciation, she presented hospital staff with framed and signed lithographs of the White House.\n\nThe First Lady was deeply affected by the infant's death and proceeded to enter a state of depression. However, the loss of their child had a positive impact on the marriage and brought the couple closer together in their shared grief. Arthur Schlesinger wrote that while President Kennedy always \"regarded Jacqueline with genuine affection and pride,\" their marriage \"never seemed more solid than in the later months of 1963\". Jacqueline's friend Aristotle Onassis was aware of her depression and invited her to his yacht to recuperate. President Kennedy initially had reservations, but he relented because he believed that it would be \"good for her\". The trip was widely disapproved of within the Kennedy administration, by much of the general public, and in Congress. The First Lady returned to the United States on October 17, 1963. She would later say she regretted being away as long as she was but had been \"melancholy after the death of my baby\".\n\nOn November 21, 1963, the First Lady and the President left the White House for a political trip to Texas; this was the first time that she had joined her husband on such a trip in the U.S. After a breakfast on November 22, they took a very short flight on Air Force One from Fort Worth's Carswell Air Force Base to Dallas' Love Field, accompanied by Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie. The First Lady was wearing a bright pink Chanel suit and a pillbox hat, which had been personally selected by President Kennedy. A motorcade was to take them to the Trade Mart, where the president was scheduled to speak at a lunch. The First Lady was seated to her husband's left in the third row of seats in the presidential limousine, with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife followed in another car in the motorcade.\n\nAfter the motorcade turned the corner onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, the First Lady heard what she thought to be a motorcycle backfiring and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and one of the shots struck her husband in the head. Almost immediately, she began to climb onto the back of the limousine; Secret Service agent Clint Hill later told the Warren Commission that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for a piece of her husband's skull that had been blown off. Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat. As Hill stood on the back bumper, Associated Press photographer Ike Altgens snapped a photograph that was featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world. She would later testify that she saw pictures \"of me climbing out the back. But I don't remember that at all\".\nThe President was rushed to Dallas' Parkland Hospital. At her request, the First Lady was allowed to be present in the operating room. After her husband was pronounced dead, Kennedy refused to remove her blood-stained clothing and reportedly regretted having washed the blood off her face and hands, explaining to Lady Bird Johnson that she wanted \"them to see what they have done to Jack\". She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she boarded Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as President. The unlaundered suit was donated to the National Archives and Records Administration in 1964 and, under the terms of an agreement with her daughter Caroline Kennedy, will not be placed on public display until 2103. Johnson's biographer Robert Caro wrote that Johnson wanted Jacqueline to be present at his swearing-in in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of his presidency to JFK loyalists and to the world at large.\n\nKennedy took an active role in planning her husband's state funeral, modeling it after Abraham Lincoln's service. She requested a closed casket, overruling the wishes of her brother-in-law, Robert. The funeral service was held at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington D.C. and the burial took place at nearby Arlington National Cemetery. Jacqueline led the procession on foot and lit the eternal flame—created at her request—at the gravesite. Lady Jeanne Campbell reported back to \"The London Evening Standard\": \"Jacqueline Kennedy has given the American people ... one thing they have always lacked: Majesty.\"\n\nA week after the assassination, new president Lyndon Baines Johnson established the Warren Commission—led by Chief Justice Earl Warren—to investigate the assassination. Ten months later, the Commission issued its report with the finding that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone when he assassinated President Kennedy. Privately, his widow cared little about the investigation, stating that even if they had the right suspect, it would not bring her husband back. Nevertheless, she gave a deposition to the Warren Commission. Following the assassination and the media coverage that had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Jacqueline stepped back from official public view, apart from a brief appearance in Washington to honor the Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President.\nOn November 29, 1963—a week after her husband's assassination—Jacqueline was interviewed in Hyannis Port by Theodore H. White of \"Life\" magazine. In that session, she famously compared the Kennedy years in the White House to King Arthur's mythical Camelot, commenting that the President often played the title song of Lerner and Loewe's musical recording before retiring to bed. She also quoted Queen Guinevere from the musical, trying to express how the loss felt. The era of the Kennedy administration would subsequently often be referred to as the \"Camelot Era,\" although historians have later argued that the comparison is not appropriate, with Robert Dallek stating that Kennedy's \"effort to lionize [her husband] must have provided a therapeutic shield against immobilizing grief\".\n\nKennedy and her children remained in the White House for two weeks following the assassination. Wanting to \"do something nice for Jackie,\" President Johnson offered an ambassadorship to France to her, aware of her heritage and fondness for the country's culture, but she turned the offer down, as well as follow-up offers of ambassadorships to Mexico and the United Kingdom. At her request, Johnson renamed the Florida space center the John F. Kennedy Space Center a week after the assassination. Kennedy later publicly praised Johnson for his kindness to her.\n\nKennedy spent 1964 in mourning and made few public appearances. In the winter following the assassination, she and the children stayed at Averell Harriman's home in Georgetown. On January 14, 1964, Kennedy made a televised appearance from the office of the Attorney General, thanking the public for the \"hundreds of thousands of messages\" she had received since the assassination and said she had been sustained by America's affection for her late husband. She purchased a house for herself and her children in Georgetown but sold it later in 1964 and bought a 15th-floor penthouse apartment for $250,000 at 1040 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in the hopes of having more privacy.\n\nIn the following years, Jacqueline attended selected memorial dedications to her late husband. She also oversaw the establishment of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, which is the repository for official papers of the Kennedy Administration. Designed by architect I.M. Pei, it is situated next to the University of Massachusetts campus in Boston.\n\nDespite having commissioned William Manchester's authorized account of President Kennedy's death, \"The Death of a President\", Jacqueline was subject to significant media attention in 1966–1967 when she and Robert Kennedy tried to block the publication. They sued publishers Harper & Row in December 1966; the suit was settled the following year when Manchester removed passages that detailed President Kennedy's private life. White viewed the ordeal as validation of the measures the Kennedy family, Jacqueline in particular, were prepared to take to preserve President Kennedy's public image.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War in November 1967, \"Life\" magazine dubbed Kennedy \"America's unofficial roving ambassador\" when she and David Ormsby-Gore, former British ambassador to the United States during the Kennedy administration, traveled to Cambodia, where they visited the religious complex of Angkor Wat with Chief of State Norodom Sihanouk. According to historian Milton Osbourne, her visit was \"the start of the repair to Cambodian-US relations, which had been at a very low ebb\". She also attended the funeral services of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 1968, despite her initial reluctancy due to the crowds and reminders of President Kennedy's death.\n\nAfter the assassination, Jacqueline relied heavily on her brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy; she observed him to be the \"least like his father\" of the Kennedy brothers. He had been a source of support after she had suffered a miscarriage early in her marriage; it was he, not her husband, who stayed with her in the hospital. In the aftermath of the assassination, Bobby became a surrogate father for her children until eventual demands by his own large family and his responsibilities as Attorney General required him to reduce attention. He credited Jackie with convincing him to stay in politics, and she supported his 1964 run for United States Senator from New York. According to biographer C. David Heymann, the two became romantically involved after her husband's death.\n\nThe January 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam resulted in a drop in President Johnson's poll numbers, and Robert Kennedy's advisors urged him to enter the upcoming presidential race. When Art Buchwald asked him if he intended to run, Robert replied, \"That depends on what Jackie wants me to do\". She met with him around this time and encouraged him to run after she had previously advised him to not follow Jack, but to \"be yourself\". Privately, she worried about his safety; she believed that Bobby was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was \"so much hatred\" in the United States. She confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was \"fatalistic\" like her. Despite her concerns, Jacqueline campaigned for her brother-in-law and supported him, and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the Kennedy family would once again occupy the White House.\n\nJust after midnight PDT on June 5, 1968, Robert Kennedy was mortally wounded by gunfire by Sirhan Sirhan minutes after he and a crowd of his supporters had been celebrating his victory in the California Democratic presidential primary. Jacqueline Kennedy rushed to Los Angeles from Manhattan to join his wife Ethel, her brother-in-law Ted Kennedy, and the other Kennedy family members at his hospital bedside. Bobby Kennedy never regained consciousness and died 26 hours after the shooting.\n\nAfter Robert Kennedy's death, Jacqueline reportedly suffered a relapse of the depression she had suffered in the days following her husband's assassination nearly five years prior. She came to fear for her life and those of her children, saying: \"If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets ... I want to get out of this country\".\n\nOn October 20, 1968, Kennedy married her long-time friend Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy Greek shipping magnate who was able to provide the privacy and security she sought for herself and her children. The wedding took place on Skorpios, Onassis' private Greek island in the Ionian Sea. After marrying Onassis, she took the legal name Jacqueline Onassis and consequently lost her right to Secret Service protection, which is an entitlement of a widow of a U.S. president. The marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity. The fact that Aristotle was divorced and his former wife Athina Livanos was still living led to speculation that Jacqueline might be excommunicated by the Roman Catholic church, though that concern was explicitly dismissed by Boston's Archbishop, Cardinal Richard Cushing as \"nonsense\". She was condemned by some as a \"public sinner,\" and became the target of paparazzi who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her \"Jackie O\".\n\nDuring their marriage, the couple inhabited six different residences: her 15-room Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan, her horse farm in New Jersey, his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island Skorpios, his house in Athens, and his yacht \"Christina O. Kennedy ensured that her children continued a connection with the Kennedy family by having Ted Kennedy visit them often. She developed a close relationship with Ted, and from then on he was involved in her public appearances.\n\nAristotle Onassis' health deteriorated rapidly following the death of his son Alexander in a plane crash in 1973. He died of respiratory failure at age 69 in Paris on March 15, 1975. His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Kennedy eventually accepted a settlement of $26 million from Christina Onassis—Aristotle's daughter and sole heir— and waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.\n\nAfter the death of her second husband, Jacqueline returned permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at Viking Press, a position that she held for two years.\n\nAfter almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, she attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors' gallery. She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 following the false accusation by \"The New York Times\" that she held some responsibility for the company's publication of Jeffrey Archer novel \"Shall We Tell the President?\", which was set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and described an assassination plot against him. Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at Faneuil Hall in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced that he was going to challenge incumbent president Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for president. She participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.\n\nFollowing her resignation from Viking Press, Kennedy was hired by Doubleday, where she worked as an associate editor under an old friend, John Turner Sargent, Sr. Among the books she edited for the company are Larry Gonick's \"The Cartoon History of the Universe\", the English translation of the three volumes of Naghib Mahfuz's \"Cairo Trilogy\" (with Martha Levin), and autobiographies of ballerina Gelsey Kirkland, singer-songwriter Carly Simon, and fashion icon Diana Vreeland. She also encouraged Dorothy West, her neighbor on Martha's Vineyard and the last surviving member of the Harlem Renaissance, to complete the novel \"The Wedding\" (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to her work as an editor, Onassis participated in cultural and architectural preservation. In the 1970s, she led a historic preservation campaign to save from demolition and renovate Grand Central Terminal in New York. A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she was a major figure in protests against a planned skyscraper at Columbus Circle that would have cast large shadows on Central Park; the project was cancelled. A later project proceeded despite protests: a large twin-towered skyscraper, the Time Warner Center, was completed in 2003.\n\nOnassis remained the subject of considerable press attention, most notoriously involving the paparazzi photographer Ron Galella, who followed her around and photographed her as she went about her day-to-day activities; he took candid photos of her without her permission. She ultimately obtained a restraining order against him, and the situation brought attention to the problem of paparazzi photography. From 1980 until her death, Jacqueline maintained a close relationship with Maurice Tempelsman, who was her companion and personal financial adviser; he was a Belgian-born industrialist and diamond merchant who was estranged from his wife.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Onassis supported Bill Clinton and contributed money to his presidential campaign. Following the election, she met with First Lady Hillary Clinton and advised her on raising a child in the White House. In her memoir \"Living History\", Clinton wrote that Onassis was \"a source of inspiration and advice for me\". Democratic consultant Ann Lewis observed that Onassis had reached out to the Clintons \"in a way she has not always acted toward leading Democrats in the past\".\n\nIn November 1993, Jacqueline was thrown from her horse while participating in a fox hunt in Middleburg, Virginia, and was taken to the hospital to be examined. A swollen lymph node was discovered in her groin, which was initially diagnosed by the doctor to be caused by an infection. The fall from the horse contributed to her deteriorating health over the next six months. In December, Onassis developed new symptoms, including a stomach ache and swollen lymph nodes in her neck, and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She began chemotherapy in January 1994 and publicly announced the diagnosis when she stated that the initial prognosis was good. She continued to work at Doubleday, but by March the cancer had spread to her spinal cord and brain, and by May to her liver. Onassis made her last trip home from New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center on May 18, 1994. The following night at 10:15 p.m., she died in her sleep at age 64. John F. Kennedy, Jr. announced his mother's death to the press, stating she had been \"surrounded by her friends and her family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved\". He added that \"She did it in her very own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that.\"\n\nOn May 23, 1994, her funeral Mass was held a few blocks away from her apartment at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, the Catholic parish where she was baptized in 1929 and confirmed as a teenager. She was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, alongside President Kennedy, their son Patrick, and their stillborn daughter Arabella. President Bill Clinton delivered a eulogy at her graveside service. At the time of her death, Onassis was survived by her children Caroline and John Jr., three grandchildren, sister Lee Radziwill, son-in-law Edwin Schlossberg, and half-brother James Lee Auchincloss. She left an estate that its executors valued at $43.7 million.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy remains one of the most popular First Ladies. She was featured 27 times on the annual Gallup list of the top 10 most admired people of the second half of the 20th century; this number is superseded by only Billy Graham and Queen Elizabeth II and is higher than that of any U.S. President. In 2011, she was ranked in fifth place in a list of the five most influential First Ladies of the twentieth century for her \"profound effect on American society\". In 2014, she ranked third place in a Siena College Institute survey, behind Eleanor Roosevelt and Abigail Adams. In 2015, she was included in a list of the top ten influential U.S. First Ladies due to the admiration for her based around \"her fashion sense and later after her husband's assassination, for her poise and dignity\".\n\nKennedy is seen as being customary in her role as First Lady, though Magill argues her life was validation that \"fame and celebrity\" changed the way First Ladies are evaluated historically. Hamish Bowles, curator of the \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years\" exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, attributed her popularity to a sense of unknown that was felt in her withdrawal from the public which he dubbed \"immensely appealing\". After Kennedy's death, Kelly Barber referred to her as \"the most intriguing woman in the world\", furthering that her stature was also due to her affiliation with valuable causes. Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony summarized that the former First Lady \"became an aspirational figure of that era, one whose privilege might not be easily reached by a majority of Americans but which others could strive to emulate\". Since the late 2000s, Kennedy's traditional persona has been invoked by commentators when referring to fashionable political spouses.\n\nA wide variety of commentators have credited Kennedy with restoring the White House; the list includes Hugh Sidey, Leticia Baldridge, Laura Bush, Kathleen P. Galop, and Carl Anthony.\n\nTina Turner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee have cited Kennedy as influencing them.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy became a global fashion icon during her husband's presidency. After the 1960 election, she commissioned French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend Oleg Cassini to create an original wardrobe for her appearances as First Lady. From 1961 to 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown, as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India, and Pakistan. In 1961, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president.\n\nKennedy preferred French couture, particularly the work of Chanel, Balenciaga, and Givenchy, but was aware that in her role as First Lady, she would be expected to wear American designers' work. After noting that her taste for Paris fashion was being criticized in the press, she wrote to the noted fashion editor Diana Vreeland to ask for suitable American designers, particularly those who could reproduce the Paris look. After considering the letter, which expressed Kennedy's dislike of prints, and her preference for \"terribly simple, covered-up clothes,\" Vreeland recommended Norman Norell, who was considered America's First Designer, and was known for his high-end simplicity and fine quality work. She also suggested Ben Zuckerman, another highly regarded tailor who regularly offered re-interpretations of Paris couture, and the sportswear designer Stella Sloat, who occasionally offered Givenchy copies. Kennedy's first choice for her Inauguration Day coat was originally a purple wool Zuckerman model that was based on a Pierre Cardin design, but she instead settled on a fawn Cassini coat and wore the Zuckerman for a tour of the White House with Mamie Eisenhower.\n\nIn her role as First Lady, Kennedy preferred to wear clean-cut suits with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three-quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless A-line dresses, above-the-elbow gloves, low-heel pumps, and pillbox hats. Dubbed the \"Jackie\" look, these clothing items rapidly became fashion trends in the Western world. More than any other First Lady, her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and a large segment of young women. Her influential bouffant hairstyle, described as a \"grown-up exaggeration of little girls' hair,\" was created by Mr. Kenneth, who worked for her from 1954 until 1986.\n\nIn her years after the White House, Kennedy underwent a style change; her new looks consisted of wide-leg pantsuits, large lapel jackets, gypsy skirts, silk Hermès headscarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses. She often chose to wear brighter colors and patterns and even began wearing jeans in public. She set a new fashion trend with beltless, white jeans with a black turtleneck that was never tucked in and instead pulled down over her hips.\n\nKennedy was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1965. Many of her signature clothes are preserved at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum; pieces from the collection were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2001. Titled \"Jacqueline Kennedy: The White House Years,\" the exhibition focused on her time as a First Lady.\n\nIn 2012, \"Time\" magazine included Kennedy on its All-TIME 100 Fashion Icons list.\n\nIn 2016, \"Forbes\" included her on the list \"10 Fashion Icons and the Trends They Made Famous\". \n\n\nJaclyn Smith portrays Kennedy in the 1981 television film \"Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy\", depicting Kennedy's life until the end of the JFK presidency. The film's producer Louis Rudolph stated an interest in creating a \"positive portrait of a woman who I thought had been very much maligned,\" comments that were interpreted by John J. O'Connor of \"The New York Times\" as erasing any chances of critique toward Kennedy. Though Smith received praise for her performance, with Marilynn Preston calling her \"convincing in an impossible role\", Tom Shales wrote \"Jaclyn Smith couldn't act her way out of a Gucci bag\".\n\nBlair Brown portrays Kennedy in the 1983 miniseries \"Kennedy\", set during the Kennedy presidency. Brown used wigs and makeup to better resemble Kennedy and said through playing the role she gained a different view of the assassination: \"I realized that this was a woman witnessing the public execution of her husband.\" Jason Bailey praised her performance, while Andrea Mullaney noted her resemblance to Kennedy and general shyness. Brown was nominated for a television BAFTA as Best Actress and a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nMarianna Bishop, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Roma Downey portray Kennedy in the 1991 miniseries \"A Woman Named Jackie\", covering her entire life until the death of Aristotle Onassis. Of being contacted for the role, Downey reflected: \"I thought I was a strange choice because I didn't think I looked anything like her and I was Irish.\" Half of Downey's wardrobe was designed by Shelley Komarov and Downey stated that though she had long harbored \"great respect and admiration\" for Kennedy, she was unaware of the troubles in her childhood. Reviewer Rick Kogan praised Downey with doing \"a surprisingly fine job in the demanding title role\", while Howard Rosenberg lamented Downey's performance failing to \"pierce this thick glaze of superficiality\". \"Ability\" credited the role with raising Downey's profile. In 1992, the miniseries won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries.\n\nRhoda Griffis portrays Kennedy in the 1992 film \"Love Field\", set shortly before and in the aftermath of JFK's assassination. It was Griffis' feature film debut. Griffis said she had been told by her orthodontist of her resemblance to Kennedy and was cast as her upon walking into the auditions for the role.\n\nSally Taylor-Isherwood, Emily VanCamp, and Joanne Whalley portray Onassis in the 2000 television miniseries \"Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis\", covering chronologically her entire life. Whalley prepared for the role by listening to recordings of Kennedy's voice along with working with a dialect coach; by the end of production, she developed an attachment to Kennedy. Laura Fries assessed Whalley as lacking Kennedy's charisma despite being \"soulful and regal\" in her own right while Ron Wertheimer viewed Whalley as being passive in the role and lamented \"the filmmakers render Jackie as Forrest Gump in a pillbox hat, someone who keeps passing close to the center of things without really touching -- or being touched by -- very much.\"\n\nStephanie Romanov portrays Kennedy in the 2000 film \"Thirteen Days\", taking place during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Philip French of \"The Guardian\" noted her small role and being out of \"the loop\" was accurate of women's roles in \"the early Sixties\". Laura Clifford called Romanov \"unconvincing\" in the role.\n\nJill Hennessy portrays Kennedy in the 2001 television film \"Jackie, Ethel, Joan: The Women of Camelot\". Hennessy prepared for the performance by watching hours of archival footage of Kennedy and cited one of the reasons for her favoring of the miniseries was its distinctiveness in not focusing \"strictly on the men or only on Jackie\". Reviewers Anita Gates and Terry Kelleher believed Hennessy brought \"elegance\" to the role while Steve Oxman panned the performance: \"Hennessy simply doesn't possess the right natural grace. But this pic has a habit of telling us more that it shows us, and the actress manages to communicate the most important elements of the story without ever making it especially convincing.\"\n\nJacqueline Bisset portrays Onassis in the 2003 film \"\". Bisset noted the glasses she used during the film were holdovers from a prior role in \"The Greek Tycoon\". Neil Genzlinger observed that Bisset \"should have known better\" in taking on the role while Kristen Tauer wrote Bisset portraying Onassis as a mother was a \"different central light than many proceeding films\".\n\nJeanne Tripplehorn portrays Onassis in the 2009 film \"Grey Gardens\" for a single scene. Tripplehorn said questions she had about Edith Bouvier Beale that she thought would be answered by being a part of the film remained unsolved. Tripplehorn received diverse reactions to her performance while Brian Lowry noted her resemblance to Onassis and small role.\n\nKatie Holmes portrays Kennedy in the 2011 miniseries \"The Kennedys\", set during the Kennedy presidency and its 2017 sequel \"\", focusing on her life after 1968. Mary McNamara and Hank Stuever regarded Holmes' performance with neutrality in their reviews of \"The Kennedys\" while Hadley Freeman called her \"bloodless\" in the role. Holmes stated reprising the role was a \"bigger challenge\" for having to act through later periods of Kennedy's life. When asked of the concurrent \"Jackie\" film, Holmes said, \"I think its really exciting. It's just is a testament to how amazing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was and how much she meant to our country.\" Holmes also stated both should be watched due to covering different periods of Jacqueline's life. In \"The Kennedys: After Camelot\", Holmes' performance was viewed favorably by Daniel Feinberg and Allison Keane while Kristi Turnquist panned her.\n\nMinka Kelly portrays Kennedy in the 2013 film \"The Butler\", giving the film's protagonist Cecil one of her husband's neckties after his assassination. Kelly said she was intimidated and scared taking on the role. Kelly admitted to having difficulty with perfecting Kennedy's voice, going \"to sleep listening to her\", and having discomfort with the wool clothing associated with the role.\n\nGinnifer Goodwin portrays her in the 2013 television film \"Killing Kennedy\". Goodwin used intimate photos to better portray Kennedy and was concerned \"to do her justice and to play her as accurately as possible without ever doing an impression of her\". Costar Rob Lowe said of seeing Goodwin in the pink Chanel suit, \"It made it real. If I were under any illusions about what we were doing, seeing her in that iconic moment was, I would say, sobering.\" Tom Carson wrote that Goodwin's \"trademark vulnerability humanizes Jackie considerably\" while Bruce Miller called her a miscast and Robert Lloyd and Brian Lowry panned her performance.\n\nKim Allen portrays Kennedy in the 2016 film \"LBJ\". Ray Bennett noted in his review of the film that Allen was in a non-speaking role.\n\nNatalie Portman portrays Kennedy in the 2016 film \"Jackie\", set during the JFK presidency and the immediate aftermath of the assassination. Portman admitted being intimidated taking the role and doing research in preparation for filming. Nigel M. Smith wrote that by portraying Kennedy, Portman was \"taking on arguably the biggest challenge of her career\". Manohla Dargis, David Edelstein, and Peter Bradshaw praised her performance. Portman was nominated for Best Actress by Academy Awards, AACTA Awards, AWFJ, AFCA, and BSFC, and won the category by the Online Film Critics Society.\n\nJodi Balfour portrays Kennedy in the eighth episode of the second season of Netflix's original drama series, \"The Crown\", set during the June 1961 visit of the Kennedy couple to the Buckingham Palace and the events that followed the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a member of the Pritzker family.\n\nPritzker was born to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Marian \"Cindy\" (née Friend) and Jay Pritzker. Pritzker graduated with a B.A. from Menlo College. His father diversified the Chicago-based family business, the Marmon Group - along with his brothers Robert Pritzker and Donald Pritzker - building it into a portfolio of over 60 diversified industrial corporations. He also created the Hyatt Hotel chain in 1957 and owned Braniff Airlines from 1983–1988. The family has been divesting its assets: in 2006, the family sold Conwood, a smokeless tobacco company, for $3.5 billion to cigarette company Reynolds American Inc; in 2007, the family sold control of the Marmon Group to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway for $4.5 billion; and in 2010, the family sold its majority stake in Transunion, the Chicago-based credit reporting company, for an undisclosed amount to Chicago-based private-equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners.\n\nIn 1972, Pritzker started his career working in the family business, Hyatt Hotels, where in 1984, he rose to become Managing Director and Divisional Vice President. In 1988, he left Hyatt to pursue his own entrepreneurial activities including become a founding member of Ticketmaster. In 1996, he formed Mandara Spa, a chain of 72 resort spas, which he hoped to pair up with Hyatt Hotels, but ended up being located entirely in competitors to Hyatt. In 2000, 40% of the company was sold to \"Shiseido Co.\" In 2001, the remaining 60% was sold to \"Steiner Leisure Limited\", a Nasdaq (STNR) listed company. In 2005, Pritzker founded the private equity firm Geolo Capital with his Mandara business partner Tom Gottlieb; Geolo Capital focused on investments in hospitality, entertainment, and health & wellness companies. In 2010, he sold his ownership interest in Hyatt to his family. Geolo Capital purchased a majority interest in the Joie de Vivre boutique hotel chain. In October 2011, he merged the 30 hotel Joie de Vivre chain with the Pomeranc family's 12 hotel Thompson Hotel Group to form Commune Hotels & Resorts which he co-chairs with Jason Pomeranc. In 2012, Commune operated 46 hotels and had $450 million in revenues. In January 2016, Commune Hotels merged with Destination Hotels, where Pritzker serves as co-chairman. With the recent merger the new company has over 97 hotels across six brands and annual revenues of over $2.3 billion.\n\nPritzker is married to Lisa Stone and they have three children, but they have since filed for divorce. Pritzker donated $15 million to the University of California at San Francisco for new pediatric emergency room facilities at the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. The Lisa and John Pritzker Family Fund funds programs focused on children's health and education, civic activities, and Jewish affairs. In 2016, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art completed a $500 million expansion, which includes the Pritzker Center for Photography.\n"}

He attended school in Monschau and Krefeld and received a practical education at his uncle's Worsted factory at Verviers (Belgium). In 1839, he worked for Société anonyme John Cockerill, a well known producer of machinery construction at that time.\n\nBecause of the riots of the Spring of Nations in 1848 Scheibler decided to leave Germany and moved to Ozorkow in Congress Poland, where his uncle, Friedrich Schlösser, had operated a textile factory since 1816. After Schlösser's death he became its commercial director. Scheibler married Anna née Werner, a niece of Schlösser, on 16 September 1854. In 1852, Scheibler and his partner Julius Schwartz bought a plot at Łódź and started to build a machinery factory. In October 1854, Schwartz sold his share to Scheibler for 10,000 rubles, making him the sole owner of the factory.\n\nIn 1855, Scheibler founded a spinning mill with 34 frames and a steam engine of 40 horsepower. In 1857, Scheibler employed 180 labourers and earned a turnover of 305,100 rubles in 1860. Scheibler made large profits after cotton prices in Europe increased because of the American Civil War and sold his stock at triple the price. He became known as the \"King of the Cotton and Linen Empires of Łódź\". In 1870, 1,911 employees worked in his factory, which was the third largest (9.3 percent) cotton producer of Poland.\n\nScheibler's factory continued to prosper and he bought several smaller mills in the districts of Źarki and Księży Młyn. After a fire destroyed the factory at Księży Młyn in 1874, Scheibler rebuilt it with 88.000 spindles and built his own \"Kingdom\" of Księży Młyn with houses for 321 families, a fire station, schools, shops and a hospital Scheibler was known for his social engagement and supported the foundation of a municipal credit association, the Commercial Bank of Łódź (Bank Handlowy) in 1872 as well as the construction of a Lutheran and a Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1880, he transformed his enterprise into a stock corporation with a share capital of 9 million Ruble.\n\nScheibler died on 13 April 1881 in Łódź and was buried at the Protestant Cemetery of Łódź in a mausoleum designed by the Warsaw architects Joseph Dziekonski and Edward Lilop.\n\n\nAndrzej Wajda's movie \"The Promised Land\" was filmed inside Scheibler's Palace, which is today the location of the Cinematographic Museum of the National Film School in Łódź.\n\nThe figure of the German industrialist Heinz Huntze, a character of The Brothers Ashkenazi, is loosely based on Karl Wilhelm Scheibler.\n\n"}

A special type of accounting is used for this, called mutual credit, or credit clearing.\n\nAlthough any accounting framework can be used, there is one approach that fits naturally for multilateral exchange. It is the simplest possible database/spreadsheet design, single-entry bookkeeping rather than double-entry bookkeeping.\n\nAll accounts begin with a balance of zero, meaning they owe nothing and are owed nothing. An account may only close at zero, meaning it has given as much as it has received, i.e. that the exchange is complete with respect to all the other accounts. When a transaction happens, an entry is made in an accounting journal of a payment, or credit flowing in the opposite direction.\nAccount balances are derived by 'adding up' the journal.\n\nThe sum of all account balances is \"a priori\" zero. Accounts which close (or are retired) above zero have given more value to the other accounts than they have received and vice versa. Thus a positive balance represents not value *in* the account, but value *owed* to that account by (the aggregate of) all other accounts.\n\nAn account's balance in such a system, indicates not the position of the account with respect to past activities with other accounts, but also the activity needed to complete the exchange. thus a balance of +10 means that not only has the account delivered +10 more value to the other members than it has received, but that in order to complete the exchange it intends to receive +10 more in the future than it delivers.\n\nBob's obligation to spend 5, exactly matches Charlie's obligation to earn 5.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2381197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2381197", "title": "Shigeo Shingo", "text": "Shigeo Shingo\n\n, born in Saga City, Japan, was a Japanese industrial engineer who was considered as the world’s leading expert on manufacturing practices and the Toyota Production System.\n\nAfter having worked as a technician specialized in fusions at the Taiwanese railways in Taipei, at the end of the World War II, in 1945, he started to work at the Japan Management Association (JMA)() in Tokyo, becoming a consultant focused on the improvement of factory management. Gathering tips from the improvement experiences in the field he had in 1950 at Toyo Ind. (now Mazda) and in 1957 at the sites in Hiroshima of the Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, since 1969 Shingō got involved in some actions in Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) for the reduction of set-up time (change of dies) of pressing machines which took him to the formulation of a specific technique based on operational analysis, which shortened set-up times from 1 to 2 hours (or even half a day) per each exchange of dies to a rapid setting of a few minutes. The method spread out under the English denomination \"Single Minute Exchange of Die\", abbreviated as SMED.\n\nShingo may well be known better in the West than in Japan, as a result of his meeting Norman Bodek, an American entrepreneur and founder of Productivity Inc. in the USA. In 1981 Bodek had travelled to Japan to learn about the Toyota Production System, and came across books by Shingō, who as an external consultant had been teaching Industrial engineering courses at Toyota since 1955. Since 1947, in fact, Shingō had been involved all over Japan in the training of thousands of people, who joined his courses on the fundamental techniques of analysis and improvement of the operational activities in factories (among which the P-Course, or \"Production Course\").\n\nShingō had written his Study of the Toyota Production System in Japanese and had it translated, very poorly, into English in 1980. Bodek took as many copies of this book as he could to the USA and arranged to translate Shingo's other books into English, eventually having his original study re-translated. Bodek also brought Shingō to lecture in the USA and developed one of the first Western lean manufacturing consultancy practices with Shingō's support.\n\nThe relevance of his contribution has sometimes been doubted, but it is substantially confirmed by the opinions of his contemporaries, many saw him even as a contributor to the fundamental concepts of TPS, such as Just in time, and the “pull” production system, which were created by Toyota and Mr.Taiichi Ohno and still remain a strong logical and practical basis for the lean production and lean thinking management approaches.\nThe myth prevails that Shingo invented the Toyota Production System but what can be stated is that he did document the system. Thanks to his charisma we owe to Shingo the merit of having contributed to the formalization of some aspects of the management philosophy known as the Toyota Production System (TPS), developed and applied in Japan since the 1950s and later implemented in a huge number of companies in the world.\n\nIn 1988, the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University recognized Dr. Shingō for his lifetime accomplishments and created the Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence that recognizes world-class, lean organizations and operational excellence.\n\nThe theorist of important innovations related to Industrial engineering, such as Poka-yoke and the Zero Quality Control, Shingō could influence fields other than manufacturing.\nFor example, his concepts of SMED, mistake-proofing, and \"zero quality control\" (eliminating the need for inspection of results) have all been applied in the sales process engineering\n\nShingo is the author of several books including: \"A Study of the Toyota Production System\"; \"Revolution in Manufacturing: The SMED System\"; \"Zero Quality Control: Source Inspection and the Poka-yoke System\"; \"The Sayings of Shigeo Shingo: Key Strategies for Plant Improvement\"; \"Non-Stock Production: The Shingo System for Continuous Improvement\" and \"The Shingo Production Management System: Improving Process Functions\".\n\n\n\nIt might be noted that in today's world, the concept of JIT or \"just in time\" manufacturing has resulted in poor availability of repair parts world-wide and is now referred to as \"Always late\" manufacturing by master tool and die makers.

He also held several appointed positions with the state of Maryland and the District of Columbia. He was one of Georgetown's and Washington's first philanthropists, and the father of banker and philanthropist William Wilson Corcoran.\n\nThomas Corcoran Jr. was born in 1754 (the exact date is not known) to Thomas and Elizabeth ( Wilson) Corcoran in County Limerick in the Kingdom of Ireland. Thomas Sr. had emigrated to Ireland from London, and the Corcorans were a merchant family. Thomas' uncle, William Wilson, emigrated in 1769 to the city of Baltimore in the Province of Maryland in North America. Thomas Jr. emigrated to the Baltimore himself in 1783, where he took a position as a clerk in his uncle's import and export business. Over the next few years, William Wilson became one of the biggest importers in Maryland. Between 1783 and 1788, Thomas made three business trips aboard his uncle's merchant vessels, traveling twice to the city of Cork in Ireland and once to Amsterdam in the Netherlands.\n\nCorcoran married Hannah Lemmon of Baltimore in 1788. That year, he traveled south with the intent of settling in Richmond, Virginia. Corcoran's first stop, however, was the village of Georgetown on the northern shore of the Potomac River in southern Maryland. Impressed with the large number of ocean-going vessels docked at the port of Georgetown, Corcoran decided to forgo his trip to Richmond and settle in Georgetown. He brought his wife and children to Georgetown in late 1788, and rented a house on Congress Street (now 31st Street NW) from which he operated a shoemaker's shop and leather goods business. He swiftly grew wealthy supplying shoes for the faculty and students at nearby Georgetown College. Corcoran also began buying tobacco and flax seed for export on his uncle's ships. He built a three-story brick home at 122 Bridge Street (now M Street NW) and moved into it in 1791.\n\nCorcoran became one of Georgetown's, and the District of Columbia's, wealthiest citizens in time. He later became a director of the Bank of Columbia, and was a member of the board of trustees of Columbia College. He moved out of the leather and shoe business and into banking and real estate, where his fortune was made.\n\nCorcoran's position in the community made him a leading political figure as well. Georgetown was incorporated by the Maryland General Assembly on December 25, 1789. The town's charter provided for a mayor, recorder, several aldermen, and a \"common council\" of 10 people. The first recorded meeting of the common council was on November 28, 1791. Corcoran was elected 22 times to the Georgetown Common Council. He was first elected Mayor of Georgetown in 1795 for a one-year term beginning January 7, 1805. His predecessor was Daniel Reintzel, a successful real estate developer under whom Georgetown had rapidly prospered. Corcoran served but a single term initially, being replaced in 1806 by Reintzell. Corcoran was again elected town mayor for terms beginning in January 1808, January 1809, and January 1810. David Wiley succeeded him for a single term, and Corcoran served his last term as mayor of Georgetown in 1812. After the Burning of Washington on August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812, some members of Congress wished to move the nation's capital away from the District of Columbia. Corcoran swiftly offered Congress and the executive branch the use of Georgetown College while the White House and United States Capitol were being rebuilt.\n\nThe Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Great Britain in July 1776, and achieved it with the Treaty of Paris in 1783 (which ended the American Revolutionary War). With ratification of the United States Constitution in 1788, a new national capital needed to be chosen. On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who chose a portion of the states of Maryland and Virginia on January 24, 1791. The Maryland land was already owned by David Burns, Daniel Carroll, Samuel Davidson, Robert Peter, and Notley Young (later known as the \"original patentees\"), and Washington needed to negotiate with them for the purchase of their property. He traveled to Georgetown for a meeting with the original patentees in March 1791. Washington was greeted at the village's entrance by Corcoran and a group of 50 men on horseback. Corcoran delivered a speech and expressed the group's support for Washington's endeavors.\n\nUntil December 1, 1800, citizens of the District of Columbia were able to vote in federal, state, and local elections in both Maryland and Virginia. In 1794, Maryland Governor Thomas Sim Lee appointed Corcoran adjutant of the 18th Regiment of the Maryland militia. Governor Benjamin Ogle promoted him to captain in 1799.\n\nPresident Thomas Jefferson appointed Corcoran a member of the Levy Court of the District of Columbia in 1801. This body, which had the authority of a county commission, helped administer the part of the District of Columbia not included in the City of Washington or the town of Georgetown. Corcoran was reappointed to the position by President James Madison in 1809, President James Monroe in 1817, President John Quincy Adams in 1825, and President Andrew Jackson in 1829. He was still a member of the Levy Court at the time of his death. His reputation also won Corcoran a seat on the first grand jury ever to sit in the District of Columbia (in 1801).\n\nPresident Madison appointed Corcoran Postmaster of Georgetown in 1815. Corcoran held the lucrative position until his death.\n\nCorcoran was a lifelong member of the Episcopal church, and was a vestryman at St. John's Episcopal Church of Georgetown. Corcoran was a noted philanthropist, and gave substantial sums of money to Columbian College, Christ Church of Georgetown, Holy Trinity Catholic Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church of Georgetown. He also gave liberally to create and endow Catholic cemeteries in Georgetown and its surrounding areas.\n\nNothing is known about Thomas Corcoran's first wife, other than she died and they had no children. It is not known if he married in Ireland or America, when he married, how long the marriage lasted, what her name was, how old she was, or what she died from.\n\nThomas and Hanna Corcoran had 12 children (six boys and six girls), six of whom survived to maturity: James, Eliza, Thomas Jr., Sarah, William, and Ellen. His youngest son, William Wilson Corcoran, became one of the richest men in the District of Columbia through his banking activities, and founded Oak Hill Cemetery and the Corcoran Gallery of Art.\n\nThomas Corcoran died of unspecified causes at his home in Georgetown on January 27, 1830. It is not clear where he was initially buried, although cemetery and burial scholar Wesley Pippenger believes it likely that he was buried at the Presbyterian Burying Ground in Georgetown. However, William Wilson Corcoran had his father's and mother's remains disinterred and reburied at Oak Hill Cemetery some time after 1850. They were interred beneath a Romanesque Revival grey granite pillar near the Corcoran Mausoleum.\n\nCorcoran is one of two mayors of Georgetown to have a D.C. public school named after him. The Corcoran School, opened in 1889, closed in 1951. It then spent 30 years as administrative space before being sold to the Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union, which used it for more than 20 years.\n\n"}
