Since a business that seeks to increase its sales level will require more assets to meet that goal, some provision must be made to accommodate the change in assets. To phrase it another way, the business must have some plan to actually finance the new assets that will be needed to increase sales.\n\nAFN is a way of calculating how much new funding will be required, so that the firm can realistically look at whether or not they will be able to generate the additional funding and therefore be able to achieve the higher sales level. Determining the amount of external funding needed is a key part of calculating AFN. \n\nA simplified version of the AFN equation is as follows: \n\ncodice_1\n\nWhen calculating AFN, consideration must be given to whether the company is already operating at full capacity; if not, they can expand sales some without having to invest in new equipment.\n\nIf a negative value is found for AFN, that means that the action would generate extra income that could be invested elsewhere. \n\nThe AFN equation is as follows: \n\nAFN = (A*/S)ΔS – (L*/S)ΔS – MS(RR)\n\nWhere:\n\nA* = Assets tied directly to sales and will increase\n\nL* = Spontaneous liabilities that will be affected by sales. (NOTE: Not all liabilities will be affected by sales such as long-term debt)\n\nS = Sales during the last year\n\nS = Total sales projected for next year (the new level of sales).\n\nΔS = The increase in sales between S and S\n\nM = Profit margin, or the profit per unit of sales\n\nMS = Projected Net Income\n\nRR = The retention ratio from Net Income and is also calculated as (1 – payout ratio)\n\nThe relevant ratios within the formula are:\n\n(A*/S): Called the capital intensity ratio\n\n(L*/S): Called the spontaneous liabilities ratio\n"}

CC provides an author flexibility (for example, he or she might choose to allow only non-commercial uses of a given work) and protects the people who use or redistribute an author's work from concerns of copyright infringement as long as they abide by the conditions that are specified in the license by which the author distributes the work.\n\nThere are several types of Creative Commons licenses. The licenses differ by several combinations that condition the terms of distribution. They were initially released on December 16, 2002 by Creative Commons, a U.S. non-profit corporation founded in 2001. There have also been five versions of the suite of licenses, numbered 1.0 through 4.0. , the 4.0 license suite is the most current.\n\nIn October 2014 the Open Knowledge Foundation approved the Creative Commons CC BY, CC BY-SA and CC0 licenses as conformant with the \"Open Definition\" for content and data.\n\nWork licensed under a Creative Commons license is governed by applicable copyright law. This allows Creative Commons licenses to be applied to all work falling under copyright, including: books, plays, movies, music, articles, photographs, blogs, and websites.\n\nWhile Software is also governed by copyright law and CC licenses are applicable, the Creative Commons recommends Free and open-source software software licenses instead of Creative Commons licenses. Outside the FOSS licensing use case for software there are to utilize CC licenses to specify a \"Freeware\" license model; examples are The White Chamber, Mari0 or Assault Cube. Also the Free Software Foundation recommends the CC0 as the preferred method of releasing software into the public domain.\n\nThere are over 35,000 works that are available in hardcopy and have a registered ISBN number. Creative Commons splits these works into two categories, one of which encompasses self-published books.\n\nHowever, application of a Creative Commons license may not modify the rights allowed by fair use or fair dealing or exert restrictions which violate copyright exceptions. Furthermore, Creative Commons licenses are non-exclusive and non-revocable. Any work or copies of the work obtained under a Creative Commons license may continue to be used under that license.\n\nIn the case of works protected by multiple Creative Common licenses, the user may choose either.\n\nThe CC licenses all grant the \"baseline rights\", such as the right to distribute the copyrighted work worldwide for non-commercial purposes, and without modification. The details of each of these licenses depend on the version, and comprises a selection out of four conditions:\n\nThe last two clauses are not free content licenses, according to definitions such as DFSG or the Free Software Foundation's standards, and cannot be used in contexts that require these freedoms, such as Wikipedia. For software, Creative Commons includes three free licenses created by other institutions: the BSD License, the GNU LGPL, and the GNU GPL.\n\nMixing and matching these conditions produces sixteen possible combinations, of which eleven are valid Creative Commons licenses and five are not. Of the five invalid combinations, four include both the \"nd\" and \"sa\" clauses, which are mutually exclusive; and one includes none of the clauses. Of the eleven valid combinations, the five that lack the \"by\" clause have been retired because 98% of licensors requested attribution, though they do remain available for reference on the website. This leaves six regularly used licenses + the CC0 public domain waiver:\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>\n\nFor example, the Creative Commons Attribution (BY) license allows one to share and remix (create derivative works), even for commercial use, so long as attribution is given.\n\nThe original non-localized Creative Commons licenses were written with the U.S. legal system in mind, therefore the wording may be incompatible with local legislation in other jurisdictions, rendering the licenses unenforceable there. To address this issue, Creative Commons asked its affiliates to translate the various licenses to reflect local laws in a process called \"porting.\" As of July 2011, Creative Commons licenses have been ported to over 50 jurisdictions worldwide.\n\nThe latest version 4.0 of the Creative Commons licenses, released on November 25, 2013, are generic licenses that are applicable to most jurisdictions and do not usually require ports. No new ports have been implemented in version 4.0 of the license. Version 4.0 discourages using ported versions and instead acts as a single global license.\n\nSince 2004, all current licenses (beside the CC0 waiver) require attribution of the original author, the BY component. The attribution must be given to \"the best of [one's] ability using the information available\". Generally this implies the following:\n\nThe \"non-commercial\" option included in some Creative Commons licenses is controversial in definition, as it is sometimes unclear what can be considered a non-commercial setting, and application, since its restrictions differ from the principles of open content promoted by other permissive licenses. In 2014 Wikimedia Deutschland published a guide to using Creative Commons licenses as for translations and as PDF.\n\nBesides licenses, Creative Commons also offers through CC0 a way to release material worldwide into the public domain. CC0 is a legal tool for waiving as many rights as legally possible. Or, when not legally possible, CC0 acts as fallback as public domain equivalent license. Development of CC0 began in 2007 and the tool was released in 2009. A major target of the license was the scientific data community.\n\nIn 2010, Creative Commons announced its Public Domain Mark, a tool for labeling works already in the public domain. Together, CC0 and the Public Domain Mark replace the Public Domain Dedication and Certification, which took a U.S.-centric approach and co-mingled distinct operations.\n\nIn 2011, the Free Software Foundation added CC0 to its free software licenses, and currently recommends CC0 as the preferred method of releasing software into the public domain.\n\nIn February 2012 CC0 was submitted to Open Source Initiative (OSI) for their approval. However, controversy arose over its clause which excluded from the scope of the license any relevant patents held by the copyright holder. This clause was added with scientific data in mind rather than software, but some members of the OSI believed it could weaken users' defenses against software patents. As a result, Creative Commons withdrew their submission, and the license is not currently approved by the OSI.\n\nIn 2013, \"Unsplash\" began using the CC0 license to distribute free stock photography. It now distributes several million photos a month and has inspired a host of similar sites, including CC0 photography companies and CC0 blogging companies. Lawrence Lessig, the founder of Creative Commons, has contributed to the site. Unsplash moved from using the CC0 licence to their own similar licence in June 2017, but with a restriction added on using the photos to make a competing service which makes it incompatible with the CC0 licence.\n\nIn October 2014 the Open Knowledge Foundation approved the Creative Commons CC0 as conformant with the \"Open Definition\" and recommend the license to dedicate content to the public domain.\n\nRights in an adaptation can be expressed by a CC license that is compatible with the status or licensing of the original work or works on which the adaptation is based.\n\nThe legal implications of large numbers of works having Creative Commons licensing are difficult to predict, and there is speculation that media creators often lack insight to be able to choose the license which best meets their intent in applying it.\n\nSome works licensed using Creative Commons licenses have been involved in several court cases. Creative Commons itself was not a party to any of these cases; they only involved licensors or licensees of Creative Commons licenses. When the cases went as far as decisions by judges (that is, they were not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or were not settled privately out of court), they have all validated the legal robustness of Creative Commons public licenses. Here are some notable cases:\n\nIn early 2006, podcaster Adam Curry sued a Dutch tabloid who published photos from Curry's Flickr page without Curry's permission. The photos were licensed under the Creative Commons Non-Commercial license. While the verdict was in favor of Curry, the tabloid avoided having to pay restitution to him as long as they did not repeat the offense. Professor Bernt Hugenholtz, main creator of the Dutch CC license and director of the Institute for Information Law of the University of Amsterdam, commented, \"The Dutch Court's decision is especially noteworthy because it confirms that the conditions of a Creative Commons license automatically apply to the content licensed under it, and binds users of such content even without expressly agreeing to, or having knowledge of, the conditions of the license.\"\n\nIn 2007, Virgin Mobile Australia launched an advertising campaign promoting their cellphone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to Flickr using a Creative Commons-BY (Attribution) license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL leading to the photographer's Flickr page on each of their ads. However, one picture, depicting 15-year-old Alison Chang at a fund-raising carwash for her church, caused some controversy when she sued Virgin Mobile. The photo was taken by Alison's church youth counselor, Justin Ho-Wee Wong, who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license. In 2008, the case (concerning personality rights rather than copyright as such) was thrown out of a Texas court for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, the collecting society Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE) in Spain sued Ricardo Andrés Utrera Fernández, owner of a disco bar located in Badajoz who played CC-licensed music. SGAE argued that Fernández should pay royalties for public performance of the music between November 2002 and August 2005. The Lower Court rejected the collecting society's claims because the owner of the bar proved that the music he was using was not managed by the society.\n\nIn February 2006, the Cultural Association Ladinamo (based in Madrid, and represented by Javier de la Cueva) was granted the use of copyleft music in their public activities. The sentence said: \"Admitting the existence of music equipment, a joint evaluation of the evidence practiced, this court is convinced that the defendant prevents communication of works whose management is entrusted to the plaintiff [SGAE], using a repertoire of authors who have not assigned the exploitation of their rights to the SGAE, having at its disposal a database for that purpose and so it is manifested both by the legal representative of the Association and by Manuela Villa Acosta, in charge of the cultural programming of the association, which is compatible with the alternative character of the Association and its integration in the movement called 'copy left'\".\n\nOn June 30, 2010 GateHouse Media filed a lawsuit against That's Great News. GateHouse Media owns a number of local newspapers, including \"Rockford Register Star\", which is based in Rockford, Illinois. That's Great News makes plaques out of newspaper articles and sells them to the people featured in the articles. GateHouse sued That's Great News for copyright infringement and breach of contract. GateHouse claimed that TGN violated the non-commercial and no-derivative works restrictions on GateHouse Creative Commons licensed work when TGN published the material on its website. The case was settled on August 17, 2010, though the settlement was not made public.\n\nThe plaintiff was photographer Art Drauglis, who uploaded several pictures to the photo-sharing website Flickr using Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License (CC BY-SA), including one entitled \"Swain's Lock, Montgomery Co., MD.\". The defendant was Kappa Map Group, a map-making company, which downloaded the image and used it in a compilation entitled \"Montgomery Co. Maryland Street Atlas\". Though there was nothing on the cover that indicated the origin of the picture, the text \"\"Photo: Swain's Lock, Montgomery Co., MD Photographer: Carly Lesser & Art Drauglis, Creative Commoms\" \", CC-BY-SA-2.0\"\" appeared at the bottom of the back cover.\n\nThe validity of the CC BY-SA 2.0 as a license was not in dispute. The CC BY-SA 2.0 requires that the licensee to use nothing less restrictive than the CC BY-SA 2.0 terms. The atlas was sold commercially and not for free reuse by others. The dispute was whether Drauglis' license terms that would apply to \"derivative works\" applied to the entire atlas. Drauglis sued the defendants in June 2014 for copyright infringement and license breach, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, fees, and costs. Drauglis asserted, among other things, that Kappa Map Group \"exceeded the scope of the License because defendant did not publish the Atlas under a license with the same or similar terms as those under which the Photograph was originally licensed.\" The judge dismissed the case on that count, ruling that the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph in the sense of the license, but rather a collective work. Since the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph, Kappa Map Group did not need to license the entire atlas under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. The judge also determined that the work had been properly attributed.\n\nIn particular, the judge determined that it was sufficient to credit the author of the photo as prominently as authors of similar authorship (such as the authors of individual maps contained in the book) and that the name \"CC-BY-SA-2.0\" is sufficiently precise to locate the correct license on the internet and can be considered a valid URI of the license.\n\nThis incident has not been tested in court, but it highlights a potentially disturbing practice. In July 2016, German computer magazine LinuxUser reports that a German blogger Christoph Langner used two licensed photographs from Berlin photographer Dennis Skley on his private blog Linuxundich.de. Langner duly mentioned the author and the license and added a link to the original. Langner was later contacted by the \"Verband zum Schutz geistigen Eigentums im Internet\" (VGSE) (Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property in the Internet) with a demand for €2300 for failing to provide the full name of the work, the full name of the author, the license text, and a source link, as is apparently required by the fine print in the license. Of this sum, €40 goes to the photographer and remainder is retained by VGSE.\n\nCreative Commons maintains a content directory wiki of organizations and projects using Creative Commons licenses. On its website CC also provides case studies of projects using CC licenses across the world. CC licensed content can also be accessed through a number of content directories and search engines (see CC licensed content directories).\n\nDue to either disuse or criticism, a number of previously offered Creative Commons licenses have since been retired, and are no longer recommended for new works. The retired licenses include all licenses lacking the Attribution element other than CC0, as well as the following four licenses:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55226628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55226628", "title": "Data ownership", "text": "Data ownership\n\nData ownership is the philosophical and legal concept of an entity owning the rights to control access to a particular set or group of data. Data ownership is typically handled in a legal setting and often associated with the question of copyright, with the person or entity that has created the data in question possessing the above rights. Data ownership refers to the rights of the creator of data as opposed to the subject of the data. Ownership also confers a variety of responsibilities to data owners regarding the maintenance and usability of that data.\n\nOwnership of data is conventionally assumed to belong to the entity that generated or purchased it. Universities and other research labs are assumed to own the data of their employees. Legally, data ownership is determined by the laws of the nation in which the data is being used. Laws concerning data ownership vary greatly not only from continent to continent, but also from nation to nation.\n\nAmerican laws consider research data to be intellectual property and therefore qualifies for the same legal protections of copyright. In addition, research data is often assumed to be the property of the institution that commissioned the research through a process known as \"works for hire\".\n\nEach of the individual members of the European Union as well as non-member countries are required to develop their own laws on data ownership.\n\nData ownership is not officially offered through any statues. Offenses introduced in the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, which was developed in order to make hacking illegal, and includes an offense for unauthorized access to computer materials.\n\nPersonal data ownership is covered under the 1978 Data Protection Act (Loi Informatique et Libertés). Laws concerned with access to and ownership of data do not exist.\n\nNo specific rights have been implemented via statute into German law, but personal information are protected in the \"Right to Personality\"\n\nLaws in Spain that concern trade secrets prevent these secrets from being accessed illegally as determined in a 2008 Supreme Court decision.\n\nOwnership over a dataset allows an entity to control the sale of the data and the access to it. Ownership of data also allows the owning entity to decide how to define and control the data and to determine how the data is to be used. Owners of the data are not required to publish this data and are entitled to use it for their own purposes such as research. Owners of data are able to gather it exclusively for the purposes of selling it to another entity through the purposes of \"Works for Hire\".\n\nData ownership comes with the responsibility to maintain and manage the data. Data owners are responsible for defining, compiling, managing both the sale, delivery distribution and security of the data. Data ownership also comes with a responsibility to store the data, and keep the data up to date. This becomes more difficult with data types that update frequently. Because of the large amount of responsibility associated with the maintenance of the data, some data scientists such as Scofield (1998) argue that Data Ownership should be called Data stewardship. In order for data to be considered effective, the owner of the data has a responsibility to update it frequently in order to ensure the data is still relevant, come up with a system to categorize and make the data usable, and allow those looking to access the data to understand how to use it.\n\nData ownership of some data can be highly controversial due to the rise of the quantifiable self=movement through fitness devices. These devices allow users to measure heartbeat and other self-regulating statistics. The data generated by these devices are collected by the companies that produce them. Ethical concerns are raised due to the sale of these units of information. Arguments for increased regulation of data ownership laws encourage more control over the sale of human data. Concerns have also risen over how patient data must be handled. in 1991 Fishbein argued that patient and financial records should be made available to the subjects.\n\nGovernment-owned data is typically expected to be open and freely available for public viewing in democratic countries. Failure to make data free and available can result in the government's intent being questioned. The Open Knowledge Foundation, an international organization that specializes in data openness and freedom of access scores nations based on the openness of the data, with a higher score indicating that the data is more free or available. Open Data is still owned by the organization that created it in accordance with the legal definitions of the nation in question. Governments are not required to make their data open, but many nations have in order to improve transparency.\n"}

{"id": "2881577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2881577", "title": "Export subsidy", "text": "Export subsidy\n\nExport subsidy is a government policy to encourage export of goods and discourage sale of goods on the domestic market through direct payments, low-cost loans, tax relief for exporters, or government-financed international advertising. An export subsidy reduces the price paid by foreign importers, which means domestic consumers pay more than foreign consumers. The World Trade Organization (WTO) prohibits most subsidies directly linked to the volume of exports, except for LDCs. Incentives are given by the government of a country to exporters to encourage export of goods. \n\nExport subsidies are also generated when internal price supports, as in a guaranteed minimum price for a commodity, create more production than can be consumed internally in the country. (These price supports are often coupled with import tariffs, which keeps the domestic price high by discouraging or taxing imports on the difference between the world price and the mandatory minimum.) Instead of letting the commodity rot or destroying it, the government exports it. Saudi Arabia is a net exporter of wheat, Japan often is a net exporter of rice.\n\nAt the WTO's Tenth Ministerial Conference, which was held in Nairobi, Kenya from 15 to 19 December 2015, the WTO member states agreed to eliminate export subsidies for agricultural products; least-developed nations have until the end of 2018 to eliminate agricultural export subsidies (until 1 January 2017 in relation to cotton exports), while developed nations agreed to eliminate most such subsidies immediately.\nExport subsidies can cause inflation: the government subsidises the industry based on costs, but an increase in the subsidy is directly spent on wage hikes demanded by employees. Now the wages in the subsidised industry are higher than elsewhere, which causes the other employees demand higher wages, which are then reflected in prices, resulting in inflation everywhere in the economy.\n\nSome countries provide indirect export subsidies in the form of tax reductions. In the United States closely held exporters of U.S. made goods may get a reduction of tax using an Interest Charge Domestic International Sales Corporation (IC-DISC).\n\n"}

A forward-looking statement predicts, projects, or uses future events as expectations or possibilities. These statements can often be misleading, as they can be mistaken for factual statements, while they are actually speculation. According to United States Code 15 Section 78u-5, a forward-looking statement may include future economic performance such as revenues or income, plans for future operations, or use of a report written by an outside reviewer.\n\nUnder U.S. law, section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, businesses must comply to standards of communication that limit risk factors. These acts were put into place partially to protect investors from ambiguous language, preventing them from making a poorly informed investment decision based on speculative statements.\n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \"safe harbor\" for certain forward-looking statements. Businesses usually include a form of a disclaimer that states that any instance of a forward-looking statement found in their material is only true at the time it was written, and they further claim that they are under no obligation to update such written statements if conditions change or that unexpected occurrences happen to affect the statement afterwards. Such forward-looking statements, however, must be identifiable by the use of certain prescribed words. This act allows companies to make speculative statements based on current market trends or research directions without fear of major repercussion, while ensuring that potential investors are informed of the speculative nature of the statements.\n\nSentences and phrases are forward-looking statements when they include any tense from present to future or similar inflection. Words like \"believe\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"plan\", \"predict\", \"may\", \"hope\", \"can\", \"will\", \"should\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"is designed to\", \"with the intent\", \"potential\", the negative of these words or such other variations thereon or comparable terminology, may indicate forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.\n\nBelow are some hypothetical examples of forward-looking statements:\n\nAn example of a safe harbour statement that is generally given during earnings release of a company (oracle - http://investor.oracle.com/files/events/2010/safe-harbor-080331.pdf):\n\nOur discussion may include predictions, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking.

De Courcy Forbes\n\nHenry De Courcy Forbes (February 24, 1849 – July 1920) was an American attorney, clubman, and member of the Forbes family who was prominent in New York society during the Gilded Age.\n\nForbes was born on February 24, 1849. He was the second son of Valeria Medora (née Wright) Forbes and Paul Siemen Forbes (1808–1886), who traveled to China in 1857 joined his cousin John Murray Forbes, the United States Consul in Canton who was a partner in Russell & Co., the largest American trading house in Qing dynasty China from the 1840s until its closing in 1891. He had two brothers, William Howell Forbes and Paul Revere Forbes; and a sister, Mary Elizabeth \"Nellie\" Forbes (1854–1932), who married Gaston Louis Philippe de Choiseul, the 6th Duc de Praslin, the son of Françoise, duchesse de Praslin and Charles de Choiseul-Praslin, the 5th Duc de Praslin, in 1874. After his brother William's death in 1896, William's widow, the former Dora Delano (sister of Frederic Adrian Delano and Sara (née Delano) Roosevelt), married Henry's other brother, Paul.\n\nHis maternal grandparents were Eliza Lee (née Warner) Wright and Samuel Turbutt Wright, the 2nd Adjutant General of Maryland. After his grandfather's early death in 1810, his grandmother remarried to Forbes' namesake, William Henry De Courcy Wright, the son of U.S. Senator and Governor of Maryland Robert Wright and Sarah (née De Courcy) Wright.\n\nForbes attended and graduated from Trinity Hall, Cambridge.\n\nFollowing the family tradition, Forbes entered Russell & Co. as a director, serving as an attorney for his father. While the firm had been extremely successful in the past, increased competition led to its decline. Russells attempted to rescue itself when it was about to bankrupt by founding the National Bank of China to draw some capital. Forbes, his brother William, and the Howqua family became founders of the Bank. S. W. Pomeroy, a Russell partner and former director of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, with other members of the company, criticized the Forbes brothers for sponsoring the new Bank which the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank viewed as rival. This led to further curtailment of credit to Russell & Co., forcing the firm to sell its assets resulting in a full collapse on June 9, 1891.

IRS collects a comprehensive range of demographic information and provides extensive coverage of consumer and product categories, including cars, household appliances, household durables, household care and personal care products, food and beverages, finance and holidays. IRS is not restricted to survey of readership alone but is synonymous with both readership & consumption across various FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) products throughout India. IRS covers information on over 100 product categories. IRS is conducted by MRUC (Media Research Users Council) and RSCI (Readership Studies Council of India).\n\nIRS was launched in the year 1995 with an objective of setting an industry standard for readership & other media measurement, & to provide insights on media & product consumption as well as consumer behavior patterns. In the year 1995-96, 23 Metro Reports were released followed by the All India Report consisting of urban and rural data. Simultaneously a software programme was developed to not just enable the optimum use of raw data but to also carry out multi media planning which provided a common basis of media evaluation.Over the years IRS has evolved to be very progressive, covering a broad spectrum of categories from Media data, Indian Demographics, Indian Market, Product Profiles, to the recently developed Telecom Report, TV Report, and IRS Countryside. Apart from a range of products offered new changes have been introduced in the method of classification of sub-regions from SCR’s to ISD’s, which is a more microscopic view of the consumer profile based on the socio−cultural ethnicity. From a user’s perspective, a few introductions in the form of participative sampling, customized queries have been introduced. Sub Metro level reporting for a better understanding of the consumer behavior patterns across different zones in the Metros & Edition wise reporting is the other recent introduction.\n\nIRS covers nearly 70 cities, 1178 towns and 2894 villages with the coverage being reviewed before the start of every round. The universe for IRS has been defined as the total resident urban and rural population of India aged 12 years and over. The survey excludes the off-shore territories such as Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. North Eastern states (excluding Assam) and Jammu and Kashmir (excluding Srinagar) are also excluded from the survey.\n\n\n\n\nIRS is the single source survey for media and product ownership/usage. The prime objective of the study is to collect readership information from a cross-section of individuals, in great detail, so as to present a true and unbiased picture of their readership habits. On the media front, it also captures information on television and cinema viewing habits, radio listening habits and Internet usage. In addition to this, IRS captures information on various FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) products, usage and consumption and durable ownership amongst households. Since media and product ownership/ consumption information is captured from the same household, it enables linkages between the media and product data. IRS equips you with information that is truly reflective of the Indian population for making informed decisions.\n\nLeading newspaper groups of India have jointly condemned the 2013 Indian Readership Survey, calling it badly flawed demanding withdrawal of the survey and a change in methodology.\n\n\n"}

Cullman Jr. He had two brothers Edgar M. Cullman and Lewis B. Cullman (married to Dorothy Freedman Cullman). He was educated at the Collegiate School (New York City) and the Hotchkiss School.\n\nIn 1929, his father purchased the Webster Tobacco Company after the 1929 stock market collapse where the younger Cullman worked during the summers while attending Yale University from which he graduated in 1935. After college he worked as a clerk in a local tobacco store and then worked at the Uppmann Cigar factory in Cuba. In 1941, his father and uncle, Howard S. Cullman, founded an investment company, Cullman Brothers Incorporated, to purchase Benson & Hedges. Cullman served during World War II and after the war, he went to work for Benson & Hedges as executive vice president until 1953. In 1954, Cullman brothers exchanged its interest in Benson & Hedges for $22.4 million in Philip Morris stock. Cullman was appointed a vice president at Philip Morris in 1954; executive vice president in 1955; president and CEO in 1957; and chairman of the board and CEO in 1967, a position he held until 1978.\n\nDuring his tenure as CEO, the Philip Morris brand Marlboro became the most popular brand of cigarette in the United States. Described as \"the cigarette industry’s chief defender against the antitobacco movement\", he oversaw the creation of the successful Marlboro Man campaign from the 1950s onwards which has since become known as an icon of American TV advertising. In a now notorious 1971 television interview on the American current affairs program \"Face the Nation\", in response to a recently published study on the large numbers of undersized babies born to pregnant female smokers he declared \"I concluded from that report that it's true that babies born from women who smoke are smaller, but they are just as healthy as the babies born to women who do not smoke. Some women would prefer having smaller babies.\"\n\nIn 1935, he married Susan Lehman, daughter of Harold M. Lehman and member of the Lehman family; they had one daughter, Dorothy Cullman Treisman, before divorcing in 1974. He then married Joan Paley Straus who had two children from a previous marriage, Tracy Straus and Barnard S. Straus Jr. They divorced soon after marrying but moved back in together after several years and remarried in 1988.\n\nAway from the tobacco industry he had a great interest in Tennis. His Company, Philip Morris, at the request of Gladys Heldman, sponsored the first Virginia Slims Women's Tennis Tour starting in 1970. He served as Chairman of the US Open at Forest Hills in 1969 and 1970 and as both President and Chairman of the International Tennis Hall of Fame from 1982 to 1988, into which he was inducted in 1990.\n"}

He became a major contractorforf the public entity known as Land Loans Institute (Instituto de Credito Territorial), which controlled the construction industry. He specialized in the construction of low-cost housing.\n\nIn the 1980s, Carrizosa became the major shareholder of Granahorrar Bank and an investor in other financial institutions such as Davivienda and Ahorramás. Construction and housing credits (mortgages) became the bank's core businesses. The housing policy of the former President Belisario Betancur helped boost the bank's success. From 1988 to 1998, the bank showed a real annual growth rate of 45%.\n\nGranahorrar Bank was part of a conglomerate called Grupo Grancolombiano which also owned Banco de Colombia, Colombia’s largest bank. In 1998, the country experienced a financial crisis, and, the Colombian government seized ownership of (expropriated) the bank from Carrizosa.\n\nGranahorrar was expropriated in 1998 as part of the economic policies executed by the Government to mitigate the financial crisis; it was the only bank expropriated without compensation. On October 31, 2005, the government sold the bank to the Spanish Bank BBVA.\n\nAs of September 2018, the Carrizosa family and the Colombian government are fighting over the government's 1998 expropriation of the bank before the United Nations Commission for International Commercial Law (UNCITRAL) in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe dispute is whether the Colombian government overstepped its boundaries and used expropriation as a political weapon, in violation of international trade treaties, in seizing the bank and then selling it for a profit. The Carrizosa family alleges that in 1998, then-President Andres Pastrana targeted Granahorrar Bank for seizure for political reasons because Carrizosa had made political donations to the opposite political party. \n\nThe Carrizosa family says that their bank was among the strongest in Colombia at the time it was seized by the government.\n\nA court ordered the government to compensate the Carrizosa family, but the government did not pay because it claimed it didn't have \"several hundred million dollars.\" The government appealed to overturn the verdict and won. Therefore, the Carrizosa family turned to international arbitration.\n\nCarrizosa is from the city of Bucaramanga, Santander. He is married to Astrida Benita; together they have three sons, Alberto, Enrique and Felipe Carrizosa. Astrida was born in Latvia and emigrated to the United States after World War II.

{"id": "2635682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2635682", "title": "Kata", "text": "Kata\n\nKata, a Japanese word, meaning , is a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone, but are also practiced within groups and in unison when training. It is practiced as a way to memorize and perfect the movement being executed. There are many professions which use the term Kata, but Kata as a term is known generally by the Martial Arts world, and typically reserved for Japanese empty hand combat systems (Karate -meaning empty hand). Traditional Korean Karate, called (Tang Soo Do) uses the term Kata and some Tang Soo Do schools do not, which is brought on by the memory of the Japanese and Korean war, where in at that time traditional Korean Karate was introduced.\n\nKata are used in many traditional Japanese arts such as theatre forms like kabuki and schools of tea ceremony (\"chadō\"), but are most commonly known for the presence in the martial arts. Kata are used by most Japanese and Okinawan martial arts, such as aikido, judo, kendo, kempo, and karate.\n\nKata originally were teaching and training methods by which successful combat techniques were preserved and passed on. Practicing kata allowed a company of persons to engage in a struggle using a systematic approaches, rather by practicing in a repetitive manner the learner develops the ability to execute those techniques and movements in a natural, reflex-like manner. Systematic practice does not mean permanently rigid. The goal is to internalize the movements and techniques of a kata so they can be executed and adapted under different circumstances, without thought or hesitation. A novice’s actions will look uneven and difficult, while a master’s appear simple and smooth.\n\n\"Kata\" is a loanword in English, from the 1950s in reference to the judo kata due to Jigoro Kano, and from the 1970s also of karate kata; but the word has come to be used as a generic term for \"forms\" in martial arts in general, or even figuratively applied to other fields.\n\nIn Japanese martial arts practice, kata is often seen as an essential partner to \"randori\" training with one complementing the other. However, the actual type and frequency of kata versus \"randori\" training varies from art to art. In iaido, solo kata using the Japanese sword (katana) comprises almost all of the training. Whereas in judo, kata training is de-emphasized and usually only prepared for dan grading.\n\nIn kenjutsu, paired kata at the beginners level can appear to be stilted. At higher levels serious injury is prevented only by a high sensitivity of both participants to important concepts being taught and trained for. These include timing and distance, with the kata practiced at realistic speed. This adjustability of kata training is found in other Japanese arts with roles of attacker and defender often interchanging within the sequence.\nMany martial arts use kata for public demonstrations and in competitions, awarding points for such aspects of technique as style, balance, timing, and verisimilitude (appearance of being real).\n\nThe most popular image associated with kata is that of a karate practitioner performing a series of punches and kicks in the air. The kata are executed as a specified series of approximately 20 to 70 moves, generally with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. There are perhaps 100 kata across the various forms of karate, each with many minor variations. The number of moves in a kata may be referred to in the name of the kata, e.g., \"Gojū Shiho\", which means \"54 steps.\" The number of moves may also have links with Buddhist spirituality. The number 108 is significant in Buddhism & Hinduism, and kata with 54, 36, or 27 moves (divisors of 108) are common. The practitioner is generally counselled to visualize the enemy attacks, and his responses, as actually occurring, and \"karateka\" are often told to \"read\" a kata, to explain the imagined events. Kata can contain techniques beyond the superficially obvious ones. The study of the meaning of the movements is referred to as the bunkai, meaning analysis, of the kata.\n\nOne explanation of the use of kata is as a reference guide for a set of moves. Not to be used following that \"set\" pattern but to keep the movements \"filed\". After learning these kata, this set of learned skills can then be used in a sparring scenario (particularly without points). The main objective here is to try out different combinations of techniques in a safe, practice environment to ultimately find out how to defeat your opponent.\n\nRecently, with the spread of Extreme Martial arts or XMA, a style of kata called CMX kata has formed. These kata are performed in tournaments and include gymnastics related elements, such as backflips, cartwheels, and splits. These kata can also be performed with weapons such as the Bo staff.\n\nJudo has several kata, mostly created in the late 19th century by Kano Jigoro, the founder of judo. The judo kata involve two participants. Judo kata preserve a number of techniques that are not permitted in competition or in \"randori\", including punches, kicks, and the use of the katana and other weapons. The study of kata is usually begun typically at around the green belt level. The most commonly studied judo kata is Nage-no-kata, which consists of fifteen throwing techniques. The Katame-no-kata is composed of pinning techniques, chokes, and joint locks. Kime-no-kata is a long kata consisting of self-defense techniques against both unarmed attacks, and attacks with swords and knives.\n\nWhile the Japanese term is most well known in the English language, forms are by no means exclusive to Japan. They have been recorded in China as early as the Tang dynasty, and are referred to in Mandarin as \"taolu\".\n\nSouth and Southeast Asian martial arts incorporate both preset and freestyle forms. In silat these are referred to as \"jurus\" and \"tari\" respectively. Malay folklore credits the introduction of forms to the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma.\n\nIn such as taekwondo and Tang Soo Do, the word \"hyung\" or \"hyeong\" is usually employed, though in some cases other words are used. The International Taekwon-Do Federation uses the word \"tul\", while the World Taekwondo Federation uses the word \"poomsae\" or simply the English translations \"pattern\" or \"form.\" Taekwondo patterns have multiple variations including \"Palgwe\" and the more popular \"Taeguk\" forms used by the WTF. Forms are included in certain taekwondo competitions and are a key element of gradings.\n\nIn Sanskrit, forms are known either as \"yudhan\" (combat form) or \"pentra\" (tactical deployment). Other Asian martial arts refer to forms by various terms specific to their respective languages, such as the Burmese word \"aka\", the Vietnamese \"quyen\" and the Kashmiri \"khawankay\".\n\nIn the Historical European martial arts and their modern reconstructions, forms are referred to as plays, drills or flourishes.\n\nMore recently kata has come to be used in English in a more general or figurative sense, referring to any basic form, routine, or pattern of behavior that is practiced to various levels of mastery.\n\nIn Japanese language \"kata\" (though written as 方) is a frequently-used suffix meaning “way of doing,” with emphasis on the form and order of the process. Other meanings are “training method” and “formal exercise.” The goal of a painter’s practicing, for example, is to merge his consciousness with his brush; the potter’s with his clay; the garden designer’s with the materials of the garden. Once such mastery is achieved, the theory goes, the doing of a thing perfectly is as easy as thinking it.\n\nKata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship movement. Computer programmers who call themselves \"Software Craftsmen\" will write 'Kata' - small snippets of code that they write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly, often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise their craft.\n\nOne of the things that characterize an organization’s culture is its kata – its routines of thinking and practice. Edgar Schein suggests an organization's culture helps it cope with its environment, and one meaning of \"kata\" is, \"a way to keep two things in sync or harmony with one another.\" A task for leaders and managers is to create and maintain the organizational culture through consistent role modeling, teaching, and coaching, which is in many ways analogous to how kata are taught in the martial arts.\n\n"}

Brewer caught the first college touchdown pass thrown by Bradshaw. Brewer was initially given a two-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons, but he left the team after sustaining an injury at the training camp in Johnson City, Tennessee.\nIn 1969, Brewer was among five members of the Louisiana Tech football team selected for All-Gulf State Conference honors by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association. The others were Bradshaw, split end Thomas Allen \"Tommy\" Spinks of Shreveport and later Arlington, Texas, offensive tackle Wayne Williams, Jr., later the Webster Parish school superintendent, and defensive back Mark Graham. Brewer and Spinks were recorded among the top pass receivers in Louisiana Tech history. Seven other Tech players were cited for \"honorable mention\" by the same sports writers, who also selected Tech coach Maxie Lambright as the GSC \"Coach of the Year\".\n\nBrewer played in four post-season classics, including two Grantland Rice Bowls, the North-South Shrine Game, and the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama. He was voted Minden's \"Outstanding Advertiser\" a month before \"Larry Brewer Day\" was observed in his hometown on May 14, 1970.\n\nBrewer was born in Minden to the former Helen Lockhart (1924-2018), a former civil servant originally from Ringgold in Bienville Parish, and Henry Clinton \"Clint\" Brewer (1920–2008), a graduate of Doyline High School in Doyline in south Webster Parish.

She was involved in the union movement, the consumer movement and the civil rights movement in the mid-20th century.\n\nLucy Randolph Mason was born on the Clarens estate in Virginia near Alexandria July 26, 1882 and grew up near Richmond. Mason was one of five children born to Episcopal minister Landon Mason and his wife Lucy Ambler Mason. She was a fifth-generation descendant of George Mason, author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights which was the model for the Bill of Rights. Mason was also related to John Marshall and Robert E. Lee (her father's second cousin).\n\nGrowing up in the Episcopal church with a clergyman father and devoted mother developed strong social convictions in Lucy and her siblings. After high school, Mason taught herself stenography while teaching Sunday school classes. It was during this time that she began to be interested in women's rights, specifically voting rights, working towards improving conditions for working people and ending racial injustice, specifically in the South. \nDuring her 20s while supporting herself as a stenographer, she devoted her free time to volunteer social service work and the suffragette movement. In 1914 the Richmond YWCA offered her a job as its industrial secretary, which she stayed on as until 1918. In 1918, Mason's mother passed away and she was forced to quit in order to be able to care for her ailing father. During the years that Mason cared for her father she continued to volunteer for the Union Label League and served as president of both the Richmond Equal Suffrage League and the Richmond League of Women Voters. In 1923, Mason's father passed and she returned to the YWCA as the general secretary and remained there until 1932. During her time as general secretary she developed a range of innovative programs that were aimed at training and the economic advancement in the lives of both white and black young women and workers in general. With the YWCA Mason generated public support for state labor laws that ensure safe workplaces, end child labor, raise minimum wages, and shorten work hours. Mason also traveled throughout the South during this time promoting voluntary employment agreements that incorporated fair labor standards. To aid this effort she wrote a pamphlet \"Standards for Workers in Southern Industry\" (1931), which was the first pamphlet of its kind. \n\nShe belonged to the Union Label League in Richmond and was a frequent speaker to community and labor groups about the importance of buying union made products and services. During World War I, American Federation of Labor (AFL) President, Samuel Gompers, appointed Mason as the Virginia chairwoman of the Women in Industry Committee, a division of the wartime National Advisory Committee on Labor.\n\nShe was so successful in her ventures during this time that she drew the interest of other female reformers, Florence Kelly and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Mason made such an impression that Kelly chose her as successor for her role as secretary of the National Consumers League (NCL). In 1932 she was appointed as General Secretary to the NCL, and moved to New York, where she lived for five years; working closely with social workers and recruiting staff for relief and welfare agencies created under the New Deal. It was during this period she met and impressed Eleanor Roosevelt, with whom she was friends with for the rest of their lives.\n\nFrom the 1900s to the 1930s, the NCL worked to pass protective labor laws and to convince consumers to buy only goods and services produced by workers who enjoyed a living wage and decent working conditions. Under Mason, the NCL won the passage of new state labor laws, lobbied for improved labor codes in the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act and helped ensure the passage of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\nIn 1937, during congressional hearings on the FLSA, Mason met Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) President, John L. Lewis, who helped arrange a job for her as the CIO's public relations representative for the South. In July 1937, at age 55, Mason moved to Atlanta and started working at the Textile Workers Organizing Committee offices and became the CIO's \"roving ambassador\" for the next 16 years.\n\nFor Mason, the CIO was \"a training ground for citizenship\" for Southern workers, a vehicle \"to bring democracy to the South\" and the means to alleviate the economic and racial injustices experienced by minorities and the poor. Mason traveled alone to small towns where union organizers and their sympathizers had been shot, beaten, threatened and jailed. She cornered hostile sheriffs, judges, newspaper editors, politicians and ministers, explaining workers' rights to organize and bargain under the new federal statutes and promoting an understanding of the need for unions.\n\nShe was known by friend and foe as \"Miss Lucy\". Her social status as a Southern lady and the daughter of an old, respected Virginia family often gained her access to political and community leaders when others were denied. You can't get much kosher than that in Virginia, but she kind of had an interest in working people that most people of that kind of background don't have...Boy, she was a power. We would all yell for Lucy anytime that we needed help and she would come into the toughest situations and was great. She played a tremendous role, a tremendous role. - Myles HortonMiss Lucy's success also rested on her blunt speech, her calm yet steely demeanor and her ability to bring civil liberties violations to the attention of federal officials, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt. For example, Mason convinced Roosevelt to send a special federal investigator to Memphis in 1940 in the wake of physical attacks on the United Rubber Workers' organizers who were trying to create an interracial union.\n\nAfter 1944, Mason worked with the CIO Political Action Committee (\"CIO-PAC\") in the South, helping to register union members, black and white, and working for the elimination of the poll tax. She also forged lasting links between labor and religious groups. She helped get the Southern Baptist Convention to adopt a resolution in 1938 recognizing \"the right of labor to organize and engage in collective bargaining to the end that labor may have a fair and living wage, such as will provide not only the necessities of life, but for recreation, pleasure, and culture.\"\n\nIn the 1940s, she organized interfaith, multi-union and interracial groups in Atlanta and other Southern cities of workers dedicated to building bridges between organized labor and the churches. Eventually, these local groups formed the National Religion and Labor Foundation. Mason was dedicated to ending white supremacy in the South, where she was a founding member of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare and she was a frequent speaker at interracial gatherings.\n\nIn 1952, Lucy Randolph Mason's autobiography was published called \"To Win These RIghts,\" which contained an introduction written but her close friend, Eleanor Roosevelt. Then, in 1953, Mason retired from the CIO due to declining health. \n\nIn 1953, due to ill health, Mason retired from active union work. Then, in 1959, she passed away in a nursing home in Atlanta. \n\n\n\"The Shorter Day and Women Workers\" - 1922\n\n\"Standards For Workers in Southern Industry\" - 1931\n\n\"Work, Wages, and Security\" - 1933\n\n\"The Industrial South\" - 1936\n\n\"To Win These Rights: a personal story of the CIO in the South -\" 1952. \n\n"}

At the beginning of the 20th century he was one of the most influential people in Serbia, a patriot and a great benefactor, also a philanthropist of education. He was the first president of the Belgrade Cooperative.\n\nHe finished his grammar school in Trebinje, Banja Luka and Brčko, and after a basic education, he was denied higher education by Turkish authorities. Instead of languishing there he left Bosnia and Hercegovina in 1872 for Belgrade, where Archimandrite Nićifor Dučić, a family friend, found him a job as an apprentice in then famous store held by Radosavljević & Ignjatijević.\n\nThree years later, when Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878) began, Ćelović went back to his native Hercegovina as a volunteer soldier. In combat against Turks he was wounded, but soon recovered and continued to fight. When Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire, volunteers from Hercegovina went back to Belgrade, thus Luka continued combating in both Serbo–Turkish wars.\n\nAfter the war, with the support of his countrymen, traders Aleksa Krsmanović and Rista Parnanos, Ćelović started his own business as an independent merchant, selling plums, corn, wheat and pigs. \n\nIn 1882 he established the Belgrade Cooperative, whose main goal was to help the middle class traders and artists by providing soft loans and avoiding loan sharks. In 1899 Ćelović was elected as President of the Board of the Belgrade Cooperative. Self-taught, with a hard work ethic he made the Belgrade Cooperative one of the strongest Serbian financial institutions.\nĆelović also did a lot to help the weaker member of society, founding the Committee for the Protection of the Blind Girls in Belgrade.\nAlthough he had a rudimentary education himself, his concern for the development of science and education was remarkable. It stemmed from the period of his life, during which he was part of the Chetnik movement, when he became closely connected with Milorad Gođevac, general Jovan Atanacković and the students from Old Serbia (now Macedonia), leading him to the lifelong conviction that education was the basis of the Serbian future. That and other reasons resulted in his making the University of Belgrade the sole beneficiary of his fortune when he died. \n\nPrinting of the \"Glasnik Hemijskog Drustva Beograd\" (Bulletin of the Chemical Society) with Nikola A. Pušin as editor and chief, was enabled thanks to financial assistance from the Luka Ćelović-Trebinje Fund.\n\nMilorad Gođevac, impressed by the success of the Bulgarian agents and \"četnici\" in converting the Macedonian Slavs to Bulgarian nationalism, proposed a similar plan of action by Serbia. In 1902 a group of Serbian nationalists, headed by Luka Ćelović and Milorad Gođevac, organized the Executive Committee of the Serbian Chetnik Organization. Ćelović himself gave generous sums from his very considerable savings to the organization. A Committee (\"Komitski odbor\") was organized at Vranje with branches at Leskovac and Niš. Serbia's government for a time discouraged this private action but educators and teachers who suffered at the hands of the Bulgars thought otherwise and eventually impressed upon the government and prevailed. \n\nApart from being a successful businessman, Ćelović was also a supportive towards common welfare, he and Dr. Milorad Gođevac, a Belgrade physician, were funding troops to fight for Old Serbia. The Bulgarian committee noticed the danger in such actions, and sentenced Ćelović and Gođevac to death in absentia. An assassin was sent by them to Serbia, but he never made it to Belgrade.\n\nĆelović was indirectly linked with Serbian combat in Macedonian Struggle, by financially helping troops to organize. In fact, Dr. Gođevac established a society which financially aided and recruited men for what became known as the \"Četnik Campaign.\" The first president was Luka Ćelović and the other leaders of the campaign were Vasa Jovanović, Ljubomir Kovačević, Žika Rafajlović and Nikola Spasić. The men solicited for the cause, and Luka Ćelović donated the enormous sum of 50,000 \"dinars\" annually to the Četnik Campaign.\n\nĆelović founded the Belgrade Cooperative and funded the construction of this extravagant and extraordinary building. His memory is best embodied by the buildings that now define Savamala, without him Savamala, as it is now would not exist. His investment in the quarter regenerated this once squalid and frequently flooded market district. Ćelović built his home on \"Kraljević Marko\" Street as well as building the palatial Belgrade Cooperative, now known as \"Geozavod\", and considered one of the most beautiful buildings in Belgrade, the work of architects Andra Stevanović and Nikola Nestorović. The magnificent Hotel Bristol, near Park Bristol and Park Luka Ćelović is the other gem in the Savamala neighbourhood. The buildings are his only real legacy, and their combination of using new architectural techniques and promoting Serbian Baroque and Art Nouveau in Belgrade show Ćelović to be a true visionary.\n\nIn his will, after passing away, Ćelović left almost all of his property to the University of Belgrade. Besides, he has founded an endowment named \"A Foundation of Luka Ćelović – Trebinjac\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47155", "title": "Means of production", "text": "Means of production\n\nIn economics and sociology, the means of production (also called capital goods) are physical and non-financial inputs used in the production of economic value. These include raw materials, facilities, machinery and tools used in the production of goods and services. In the terminology of classical economics, the means of production are the \"factors of production\" minus financial and human capital.\n\nThe social means of production are capital goods and assets that require organized collective labor effort, as opposed to individual effort, to operate on. The ownership and organization of the social means of production is a key factor in categorizing and defining different types of economic systems.\n\nThe means of production includes two broad categories of objects: \"instruments of labor\" (tools, factories, infrastructure, \"etc.\") and \"subjects of labor\" (natural resources and raw materials). People operate on the subjects of labor using the instruments of labor to create a product; or stated another way, labor acting on the means of production creates a good. In an agrarian society the principal means of production is the soil and the shovel. In an industrial society the means of production become social means of production and include factories and mines. In a knowledge economy, computers and networks are means of production. In a broad sense, the \"means of production\" also includes the \"means of distribution\" such as stores, the internet and railroads (Infrastructural capital).\n\nThe analysis of the technological sophistication of the means of production and how they are owned is a central component in the Marxist theoretical framework of historical materialism and in Marxian economics.\n\nIn Marx's work and subsequent developments in Marxist theory, the process of socioeconomic evolution is based on the premise of technological improvements in the means of production. As the level of technology improves with respect to productive capabilities, existing forms of social relations become superfluous and unnecessary, creating contradictions between the level of technology in the means of production on the one hand and the organization of society and its economy on the other. These contradictions manifest themselves in the form of class conflicts, which develop to a point where the existing mode of production becomes unsustainable, either collapsing or being overthrown in a social revolution. The contradictions are resolved by the emergence of a new mode of production based on a different set of social relations including, most notably, different patterns of ownership for the means of production.\n\nOwnership of the means of production and control over the surplus product generated by their operation is the fundamental factor in delineating different modes of production. Capitalism is defined as private ownership and control over the means of production, where the surplus product becomes a source of unearned income for its owners. By contrast, socialism is defined as social ownership of the means of production so that the surplus product accrues to society at large.\n\nMarx's theory of class defines classes in their relation to their ownership and control of the means of production. In a capitalist society, the bourgeoisie, or the capitalist class, is the class that owns the means of production and derives a passive income from their operation. In contrast, the proletariat, or working class, comprises the majority of the population that lacks access to the means of production and are therefore induced to sell their labor power for a wage or salary to gain access to necessities, goods and services.\n\nTo the question of why classes exist in human societies in the first place, Karl Marx offered a historical and scientific explanation that it was the cultural practice of ownership of the means of production that gives rise to them. This explanation differs dramatically from other explanations based on \"differences in ability\" between individuals or on religious or political affiliations giving rise to castes. This explanation is consistent with the bulk of Marxist theory in which Politics and Religion are seen as mere outgrowths (superstructures) of the basic underlying economic reality of a people.\n\nFactors of production are defined by German economist Karl Marx in his book \"Das Kapital\" as labor, subjects of labor, and instruments of labor: the term is equivalent to means of production plus labor. The factors of production are often listed in economic writings derived from the classical school as \"land, labour and capital\". Marx sometimes used the term \"productive forces\" equivalently with \"factors of production;\" in \"Kapital\", he uses \"factors of production\", in his famous Preface to the \"Critique of Political Economy\", he uses \"productive forces\" (that may depend on the translation).\n\nProduction relations (German: \"Produktionsverhältnis\") are the relations humans enter into with each other in using the means of production to produce. Examples of such relations are employer/employee, buyer/seller, the technical division of labour in a factory, and property relations.\n\nMode of production (German: \"Produktionsweise\") means the dominant way in which production is organised in society. For instance, \"capitalism\" is the name for the capitalist \"mode of production\" in which the means of production are owned privately by a small class (the bourgeoisie) who profits off the labor of the working class (the proletariat). Communism is a mode of production in which the means of production are not owned by anyone, but shared in common, without class based exploitation.\n\n"}

The building was developed by Irwin Molasky's company, The Molasky Group. Construction began in 2005, and the building was topped off in July 2006, before opening in August 2007. The Molasky Corporate Center is a green building designed with energy efficient features which earned it a Gold certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The Southern Nevada Water Authority is a major tenant in the building, and owns five of the building's office floors.\n\nIn December 2004, developer Irwin Molasky was planning a $75 million office building in downtown Las Vegas through his company, The Molasky Group. The project, known as Parkway Center, would be located on property at the intersection of Grand Central Parkway and F Street (later renamed City Parkway), directly south of Highway 95 and Interstate 15. The vacant property was worth $2 million, and the city gave Molasky the land on the condition that he use it for the construction of extensive office space to generate substantial property taxes for the city. The 14 ½-story building would include a 6 ½-story parking garage topped by eight floors of office space. The project, designed by Howard F. Thompson & Associates, would include of office space.\n\nLater in December 2004, the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) approved plans to lease at least five floors of office space in the building, totaling , with the option to lease further space in the future. SNWA would be the first major tenant in the new building, which would become SNWA's new headquarters. Molasky's company would be headquartered on the top floor, and discussions were underway with other tenants interested in leasing the remaining office space not used by SNWA, which signed a 20-year, $63.3 million lease for seven floors in the new building, totaling . The lease included the option for SNWA to purchase the entire building at the end of its lease. Parkway Center was expected to open in 2007, and would be one of the largest office buildings in Las Vegas. The building was expected to generate $500,000 annually in property taxes for the city.\n\nIn February 2005, The Molasky Group sold its 17-story Bank of America Plaza building in downtown Las Vegas for $72 million, which the company planned to use to finance other projects, including Parkway Center. Construction began in 2005, with Marnell Corrao as the general contractor. By April 2006, the project was known as the Molasky Corporate Center, with 16 stories planned. The building was topped off in July 2006. By October 2006, the 1,400-space parking garage was nearly complete. The Class A office building was 80 percent pre-leased up to that point. Notable tenants, in addition to SNWA, included the Las Vegas Valley Water District, Bank of Nevada, a Jason's Deli restaurant, and a 24 Hour Fitness gym. Construction was nearing completion in March 2007, by which point two major law firms had signed on as tenants: Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll; and Brownstein, Hyatt, Farber, Schreck.\n\nThe building opened in August 2007, when the first SNWA employees began working in it. It was the first new office tower in downtown Las Vegas in nearly 40 years and it helped to revitalize the area. It is also the only building by Irwin Molasky to feature his name. The building, located at 100 City Parkway, was built at a cost of $107 million.\n\nIn December 2007, SNWA approved plans to purchase five of the seven floors that it leased in the building, at a sale price of $34.6 million. SNWA had the option to gradually purchase remaining parts of the building over the next 15 years. In May 2012, SNWA approved a lease for its first tenant in of its unused office space, which would be occupied by a firm specializing in public relations and government affairs. SNWA had an additional of vacant space on its five floors. As of April 2015, the Molasky Corporate Center was the only Class A office building in the Las Vegas Valley with zero vacancy.\n\nThe Molasky Corporate Center is a 17-story green building and was designed with energy efficient features. Upon opening, it was Las Vegas' only Class A green office tower. The building includes of space, including of office space. The building is made of glass and steel, qualifying it as Class A office space. The building includes energy efficient glass solar panels that create electricity for the building, and air vents are situated on the floor instead of the ceiling, providing cleaner air to people inside. Chilled water used for the air conditioner is recaptured and used for the building's landscaping. The building's insulation consists of shredded, recycled blue jeans. The building was constructed with 97 percent recycled steel, and countertops in the building's retail area were made with 95 percent recycled steel and crushed glass. The building's office space includes special tiles that have computer and electrical outlets which can be moved around with ease. Much of the interior is lit by sunlight. At night, the building is lit with green accent lighting and a yellow crown.\n\nInitially, Molasky sought a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for the building from the U.S. Green Building Council. Ultimately, the building received a Gold certification instead. As of 2007, the building was among approximately 200 in the world to receive the Gold certification. It was the first green office building in Las Vegas to receive a Gold rating. Between $5 million and $7 million was spent on the building to bring it up to Gold LEED standards, and as of 2007, the cost was not expected to be redeemed for 12 to 15 years. The building uses 35 percent less water and 37 percent less electricity in comparison to a similarly sized, non-LEED certified structure.\n\nIn December 2007, footage of the building was filmed for a six-part PBS documentary about green buildings in Nevada. The building helped Nevada become the top U.S. state in 2011 for the construction of green buildings. In May 2014, judges for the Building Owners and Managers Association awarded the building The Outstanding Building of the Year (TOBY) Award, praising the building's environmental design features and writing that the building \"is impressive\" and \"leaves no doubt to its quality.

Those who practice ritual servitude usually feel that the girl is serving the god or gods of the shrine and is married to the gods of the shrine.\n\nIf a girl runs away or dies, she must be replaced by another girl from the family. Some girls in ritual servitude are the third or fourth girl in their family suffering for the same crime, sometimes for something as minor as the loss of trivial property.\n\nIt is still practiced in the Volta region in Ghana, in spite of being outlawed in 1998, and despite carrying a minimum three-year prison sentence for conviction. Among the Ewes who practice the ritual in Ghana, variations of the practice are also called \"trokosi\", \"fiashidi\", and \"woryokwe\", with \"trokosi\" being the most common of those terms. In Togo and Benin it is called \"voodoosi\" or \"vudusi\". Victims are commonly known in Ghana as fetish slaves because the gods of African Traditional Religion are popularly referred to as fetishes and the priests who serve them as fetish priests.\n\n\"Trokosi\": the general name by which it is called in Ghana by both proponents and opponents of the practice\n\n\"Ritual\" or \"customary servitude\": designations by which it is called in Ghana law forbidding the practice\n\n\"Fiashidi\": another name used by some districts in Ghana\n\n\"Woryokwe\": another name used by some districts in Ghana\n\n\"Vudusi\" (also voodoosi, voudousi, vaudounsi, voudounsi, etc.): the general name by which it is called in French-speaking countries such as Togo and Benin\n\n\"Shrine slavery\": a designation often used by NGOs to describe the practice\n\n\"Fetish slavery\": a popular designation used in Ghana, where \"fetish\" refers to the deity of the shrine\n\n\"Hierodulic slavery\": a designation used by anti-slavery groups meaning sacred or religious slavery\n\nHuman rights organizations and other NGO's commonly use the words \"servitude\", \"slaves\", and \"slavery\" as non-technical, popularly understood terms that describe the reality of this practice. They point out that the practice meets all the commonly accepted definitions of slavery.\nShrine slaves perform services which are not voluntary and are not paid. Their lives are totally controlled by the shrines, who in a sense become their owners.\n\nProponents of the system of ritual servitude by any of its names object to this term, but except for the technical terms \"trokosi\", \"vudusi\", \"fiashidi\", \"woryokoe\", the problem is coming up with a suitable alternative. Sometimes they have compared the trokosi to traditional queen mothers, implying a sense of respect for them, but one representative of an NGO who claims to have interviewed hundreds of participants reports that the participants themselves are offended at being called queens and insist they are/were simply slaves.\n\nJuliana Dogbadzi, who served 17 years as a trokosi, says she was \"slave to a fetish priest\". Cudjoe Adzumah made a study of the practice in the Tongu Districts of Ghana and defined \"trokosi\" as \"slaves of the gods\".\n\nEmmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, a native Ghanaian of Harvard University, says that \"tro\" means a \"god\" and \"kosi\" is used at different times to mean either \"slave\", \"virgin\", or \"wife\". Anita Ababio, a Ghanaian lawyer who has extensively researched the issue, explains that the Adangbe and Ga word, \"woryokwe\" comes from \"won\" meaning cult, and \"yokwe\", meaning \"slave\". Thus, she claims, a \"woryokwe\" is a \"slave of a cult\". Robert Kwame Amen in \"Ghana Studies\" also refers to trokosi as an institution of slavery. Likewise, Stephen Awudi Gadri, President of the Trokosi Abolition Fellowship of Ghana, and also himself from a shrine family, claims that trokosi are \"slaves of the deities of the shrines\". \"Though euphemistically, they are called the 'deity's wives', yet they serve the priests and elders of the shrine and do all the hard chores, as well as becoming sexual partners of the priest,\" Gadri says. He also says, \"the trokosi works for the priest without any form of remuneration whatsoever\", and \"it is a form of slavery\".\nAbabio claims, \"The servile status of the trokosi is seen in the duties they perform in the shrines, for which no payment is made...unfortunately for most trokosi, when they are freed they are still bound by rituals which keep them connected or attached to a shrine for life. Practically it means that these victims of ritual servitude always have the rights of ownership exercised over them.\" She then goes on to quote Article 7 of \"The Convention on Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery\", which defines a slave as \"a person over whom any or all powers attaching to the rights of ownership are exercised\". Angela Dwamena-Aboagye, a Ghanaian lawyer, says ritual servitude is \"slavery, pure and simple. It violates every human right.\"\n\nSome of the traditional priests also admit the trokosi are slaves. For example, Togbe Adzimashi Adukpo, a shrine priest, admitted in an interview with BBC in February 2001, \"Yes, the girls are my slaves. They are the property of my shrine.\"\n\nOn the question of whether trokosi is a form of slavery and whether sexual abuse is involved the answers are polarized into two camps. Some traditionalists defend the system saying that it is simply a cultural practice of certain shrines and as such should be protected. These defenders claim that while instances of sexual abuse may occur, there is no evidence that sexual or physical abuse is an ingrained or systematic part of the practice. According to them, the practice explicitly forbids a Trokosi to engage in sexual activity or contact. The other camp is represented by NGOs working with the trokosi and by former trokosi who have been liberated. These opponents of the practice have recorded testimony of hundreds of former (now liberated) trokosi who say that sexual abuse was a regular part of their time at the shrine, claiming the number of children born to them by the priest and shrine elders is a witness.\n\nAlthough virtually everyone recognizes that the victims themselves have no choice or say in their lot, Stephen Awudi Gadri says that \"both the parents (of the victims) and the girls (that is, the victims) have no choice\".\n\nSimon Abaxe has researched the practice in Ghana. He says that ritual servitude is part of African Traditional Religion in some places, but not a universal practice of that religion. A form of it is also practiced in India and Nepal as part of Hindu religion, and various forms of it were part of ancient religious traditions of devotion to various gods and goddesses. It is distinguished from the Christian monastic tradition at a basic level since ritual servitude is involuntary on the part of the participant, in contrast to Christian monasticism, which is voluntary.\n\nThere are two major reasons for the practice of ritual servitude. Most common is the concept of atonement. A girl is given to the shrine or to the gods as a kind of \"living sacrifice\" to atone for the real or alleged crimes of a family member or ancestor, as discerned by the priest of the shrine. During a process of divination he calls on the gods of the shrine to reveal this information. Girls given to atone for such crimes in a sense are considered a kind of savior, for as long as she remains in the shrine or under its control, the anger of the god is believed to be averted from the rest of the family.\n\nThe second most frequent reason for the practice of ritual servitude is that the girl is given for the continuous repayment of the gods for services believed to have been obtained or favors believed to have been rendered from the shrine. Thus a girl may be given into ritual servitude when someone believes a child has been conceived or a person has been healed, for example, through the intervention of the shrine.\n\nProponents of the practice claim that some participants choose a life of ritual servitude of their own volition, but human rights organizations claim that while this may be theoretically possible, they haven't found one yet.\n\nIn the past, the traditions of the shrines were veiled in secrecy, and people dared not discuss them, fearing the wrath of the gods if they dared to do so. For this reason, the practice was neither widely known nor well understood. In more recent times, since the 1990s at least, abolitionists and human rights advocates have penetrated the veil of secrecy. The issue has been widely discussed, for instance, in the newspapers and on the radio in Ghana.\n\nThe giving of virgin girls to the gods was part of many ancient religions. In West Africa, the practice has gone on for at least several hundred years. Similar practices using similar terminology were found in the royal court of the Kingdom of Dahomey (in what is now Benin) in the 18th and 19th centuries. Wives, slaves, and in fact all persons connected with the royal palace of Dahomey were called \"ahosi\", from \"aho\" meaning \"king\", and \"si\" meaning \"dependent\" or \"subordinate.\" By one estimate there were 5,000 to 7,000 ahosi living in the palace at Abomey, and no men lived there except for a few hundred eunuchs were charged with controlling the women. After sunset no men at all were allowed in the palace except the king, and he was guarded by women guards called Amazons. The king controlled every aspect of the lives and even the deaths of the ahosi. Visitors to old Abomey today are shown a mass grave and told that the king's wives \"volunteered,\" on his death, to be buried alive with him in order to accompany him and serve him in the world to come. One researcher pointed out, \"Of course, one should not make the mistake of ascribing modern democratic meaning to the word \"volunteered\" as if the wives wanted to die or had any choice in the matter. Ahosi who became too powerful or too independently minded were simply sacrificed (literally and physically) in the annual office ceremony lasting several days in which the power of the king was renewed by hundreds of human sacrifices, usually performed by public beheadings.\n\nThe practice was documented by A. B. Ellis who was an eyewitness of the practice in the Dahomey Empire (now Benin) in 1879. According to Ellis, one god called \"Khebioso\" had 1500 wives in Dahomey alone, the women being called \"kosio\". He said they cared for the shrines of the gods, but their main business was religious prostitution. According to Ellis, most of the gods of the Ewe-speaking people at that time had such women who were similarly consecrated to their service and were commonly considered \"wives\" of the gods.\n\nOne might argue that those ahosi were wives of the king and lived in the palace, not wives of the gods living in the shrines. But that distinction is not as clearcut as it might first seem, for the palace was the center of Dahomean religious life, and the place where sacrifices were made and rituals to the ancestors were performed. Over time, then, it was an easy jump from being ahosi living lives totally controlled by the king in the palace where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed, to being trokosi living lives totally controlled by a priest in a shrine where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed. It was a very easy transition indeed. Even in the time of the Kingdom of Dahomey, one reads of the vodun or gods successfully demanding that someone become a devotee or vodunsi (wife or follower of the god).\n\nAs people migrated within West Africa, the practice spread. Sandra Greene has noted that in Ghana, the practice dates to at least the late 18th century. At the time the Amlade clan Sui became very powerful, and began to demand female slaves from those who sought its services. The practice called \"replacement\" also began in Ghana at that time. Under this practice, if a shrine slave died or ran away, the family was required to replace her with another girl. At the beginning of the 19th century, Nyigbla became the chief Anlo deity, and its shrines also began to demand slaves for its services. Involuntary slavery, however, was not at that time and in that place common, since Nyigbla also instituted a practice called foasi, whereby two servants were recruited annually on a more-or-less voluntary basis. At that time, the slaves were often married to members of powerful priestly families.\n\nIt is reported by traditionalists that since the mid-18th century the Bremen missionaries decried the practice and purchased freedom for individual trokosi, which were then called \"new made slaves\", converting them to Christianity.\n\nWhen Ghana (then Gold Coast) was under colonial rule, a few citizens complained about the practice, but the colonial masters turned their heads. They derided him as \"the blind man who wants to help others see\". The colonial government did investigate the practice at Atigo shrine near Battor from 1919 to 1924. The investigating District Commissioner, W. Price Jones, called it \"a pernicious habit of handing girls over to the fetish\", but for economic reasons, decided not to interfere. As a result of that inquiry, shrine slaves held at the Atigo shrine were told they could return home if they wished. Soon after, the colonial government ignored another complaint that the shrine was still keeping trokosi. After that, the practice slid back into secrecy and was not brought to the public consciousness again until 1980.\n\nThe practice was drawn into the national spotlight at that time when Mark Wisdom, a Baptist pastor, responded to what he claims was a vision from God, and challenged the system in the national media. Wisdom claimed that as he prayed, he saw a vision of women in bonds, crying out for help. Wisdom claimed to have later discovered these same women on one of his evangelistic missions, held in bondage in a shrine just across the Volta River from his home, but previously unknown to him. He began publicly denouncing the practice, so much so that headlines in Ghana screamed that he was not afraid of the shrine priests. Wisdom wrote a book on the subject, founded FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), and was instrumental in some of the earliest liberations, but it was his bold public statements reported in the news that pricked the national consciousness.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Ghanaian journalist Vincent Azumah found courage to write publicly about the practice and sparked a nationwide debate. Then the International Federation of Women Laywyers in Ghana (FIDA) organized an investigation into shrine practices and issued a report in 1992. These events took place while Jerry Rawlings still held the presidency of Ghana with an iron fist. Rawlings and his administration were defenders of African Traditional Religion, calling it the \"African Heritage\" and a cause for national pride. One example of this was his granting of free air time to the founder of the Afrikania movement, Okomfo Damuah, at a time when Christian churches were virtually denied access to both radio and TV. Azumah and FIDA's actions were very bold in the light of the political climate of the day.\n\nThe Ghana National Commission on Children brought attention to the issue during the celebration of the Organization of African Unity Day of the African Child on June 16, 1993. In 1994 and 1995 Ghanaian lawyer Anita Heymann Ababio researched the practice in the light of Ghanaian law, and recommendations from this research later became a Law Reform Commission report to the Ghana government in 1995. According to Emmanuel Kweku Akeampong, a Ghanaian professor of history at Harvard University, the practice of trokosi was much in the national attention in 1996 and 1997.\n\nIn 1998 the Law Reform Commission, drawing on the recommendations of Ababio and others, drafted a law specifying \"ritual or customary servitude\" as a crime. The law passed, requiring a mandatory three-year prison term for those found guilty.\n\nIn 1999 Juliana Dogbadzi, a former trokosi, won the Reebok Human Rights Award for her efforts in speaking up on behalf of her fellow trokosi.\n\nAlthough the practice was outlawed in Ghana in 1998, it continued, due to fear and the reluctance of the government to interfere with traditional practices. Some NGOs had already worked to liberate shrines, but after the law did not solve the problem, NGOs began to get even more seriously involved in advocating against the practice and in working for agreements to reduce the practice by liberating individual shrines.\nSome of the organizations that have joined the effort are UNICEF, International Needs Network Ghana, the Swiss \"Sentry Movement\", Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, the Anti-Slavery Society, and Every Child Ministries. Survivors for Change is a group of former trokosi who have banded together to speak up against the practice. Organizations that have been most active in liberating ritual slaves are FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), founded by Mark Wisdom, International Needs, and Every Child Ministries. Christian NGOs and human rights organizations have been fighting it—working to end the practice and to win liberation for the shrine slaves. They have carried out their activities with strong support from CHRAJ—The Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice—and the Ministry of Women's and Children's Affairs. A Court of Women was organized in Accra in 2003 to continue the fight against the practice.\n\nThe word trokosi comes from the Ewe words \"tro\", meaning deity or fetish, and \"kosi\", meaning female slave. The \"tro\" deity is not, according to African traditional religion, the Creator or what might be called the \"High\" or Ultimate God. \"Tro\" refers to what African Traditional Religion calls the \"small gods\" or \"lesser deities\"—spirits of nature, etc. which are venerated in traditional religion. The term trokosi is commonly used in English in Ghana, as a loanword.\n\n\nOpponents of the practice claim that all except those who joined of their own volition are virtually slaves in every normal sense of the word.\n\nNGO's point out that practices in traditional shrines vary, but trokosi are usually denied education, suffer a life of hardship, and are a lonely lot, stigmatized by society.\n\nThe period of servitude varies from a few months to life. In some cases it involves payment of a heavy fine to the shrine, which can require many years of hard labor or even a lifetime of service to pay. In shrines where the period of servitude is limited, after a ritual and sometimes after months or years in the shrine, the Trokosi returns to her family, but her life is still controlled by the shrine for the rest of her life. Supporters of the practice claim that in the vast majority of cases, there is no particular stigma attached to one's status as a former Trokosi shrine participant. NGOs working to rehabilitate former trokosi say that the social stigma is immense and that it is the most enduring and difficult aspect of the practice.\n\nRitual slavery shows a high degree of cohesiveness, but there are many significant differences as it is practiced in various shrines and in various areas. Every Child Ministries, a Christian NGO that has done much research on the topic, lists these as variations that they have observed in their work:\n\nMost frequently those in ritual servitude are young virgin girls at the time of entry into the shrine. Of course, the girls grow up, so where their servitude is long or lifetime, the participants are of all ages.\n\nThere are two basic lengths of service—perpetual or lifetime service and limited service. One traditional priest expressed the view that once a crime had been committed, it had to be atoned for until the end of time. This is the view of lifetime or perpetual service. Shrine slaves serving for a lifetime have no hope of ever getting free unless outsiders intervene on their behalf. In some shrines, in some areas, and for some alleged crimes, the service is limited to a specific number of years. In other cases, a substantial fee is exacted from the shrine slave or her family. The girls work to try to earn that fee, but in reality the fee is so high and their means of paying it so low that there is virtually no hope of ever paying off the debt that has been laid on them.\nSome shrines have taken so many slaves that they cannot contain them all. Some slaves become unattractive or unuseful to the priest. In these cases trokosia may be given what is called \"temporary\" release. This is actually a misnomer, since it is a permanent condition. The temporary part only gives the slave permission to live outside the shrine temporarily. All the important decisions of her life are still controlled by the shrine, she is still at the beck and call of the priest, and she has to serve at the annual festival of the god every year, for which she is required to bring gifts that may take her all year to accumulate.\nOne child of a trokosi on \"temporary release\" said, \"whenever my mother goes fishing or does any work, she must divide it into three, with two parts going to the priest.\"\n\nWhere perpetual or lifetime servitude is practiced, the shrines often, but not always, practice what they call \"replacement.\" when a trokosi or vudusi dies or runs away, she has to be replaced by another virgin from the same family or clan. Some human rights interviewers report that they have interviewed numerous girls who were the third or fourth replacements for their families for a crime that was allegedly committed long ago.\n\nIn most shrines it is considered a duty of the shrine slaves to have obligatory sex with the priest and sometimes the elders. The priest's genital organs have been dedicated to the gods of the shrine, so having sex with him is considered a sacred act - in a sense, copulating with the gods. This is the origin and meaning of the term \"wives of the gods.\" Many trokosi and vudusi have described beatings and other severe punishments imposed on them for refusing sex with the priest. In Ghana, human rights organizations monitoring the practice of \"trokosi\" claim that shrine slaves often end up with an average of four children while in servitude, many of them by the priest or elders of the shrines. Proponents of ritual servitude deny that this is a part of the practice. There seem to be wide differences between practices in different districts, but Rouster claims that the problem of forced sex in many of the shrines is too well documented to be disputed.\nStephen Awudi Gadri, founder of Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, speaks of \"ritual violation after menarche\" (first menses) as the beginning of a life of coerced sex. He refers to the trokosi as \"vestal virgins.\" \n\nTreatment of girls in the shrine varies as to feeding practices, reasons for and severity of punishments, sleeping and living conditions. Severe and widespread problems have been documented in all these areas by human rights organizations. Many of the shrine slaves are required to do heavy physical labor like cultivating fields with a hand hoe. Other common duties are weaving mats, making and selling firewood (with all profits going to the priest or the shrine), fetching wood and water, sweeping the compound and attending the images of the gods.\n\nNGO's and other human rights organizations are fighting the practice. Since the 1990s, these groups have actively sought to liberate girls held in ritual servitude. Liberation has been done on a shrine-by-shrine basis, with NGO's seeking to reach community-wide agreements that all the slaves of a particular shrine will be liberated and the practice of slavery or ritual servitude will be permanently ended in that place. When such an agreement is reached, a public ceremony is held for the signing of the documents and often, liberation certificates for the former slaves. The shrine is compensated for its loss and the former trokosi begin a process of rehabilitation which usually includes learning vocational skills.\n\nThe most active groups in liberating shrine slaves through negotiated community agreements have been FESLIM, Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement, International Needs Network, and Every Child Ministries.\n\nThe first liberation ceremonies were held at Lomo and Me shrines in Volo in October 1996, at three shrines in Dorfor in December 1996, and at Atigo shrine in Battor in January 1997.[54] International Needs Network liberated 400 trokosi from a group of small shrines in November 2000, and 126 at Adidome in November 2001. Every Child Ministries cooperated with International Needs Network to liberate 465 trokosi from three shrines of the Agave area in January 2003 and with Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement to liberate 94 shrine slaves from Aklidokpo shrine near Adidome in January 2004. They continued the effort, liberating 120 from Sovigbenor shrine in Aflao in December 2005, and 52 \"yevesi\" or servants of the thunder god from the Kadza Yevesi Shrine at Aflao in March 2010. Shrines of the Anlo clan in Ghana also hold trokosi, but have resisted liberation and defended the practice, defending their practice of trokosi as being more humane than the practices of other districts. Human rights organizations insist that the practice must be totally eradicated.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "859072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=859072", "title": "Vesting", "text": "Vesting\n\nIn law, vesting is to give an immediately secured right of present or future deployment. One has a vested right to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset. When the right, interest, or title to the present or future possession of a legal estate can be transferred to any other party, it is termed a vested interest.\n\nThe concept can arise in any number of contexts, but the most common are inheritance law and retirement plan law. In real estate, to vest is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else’s property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one’s right to an easement becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing.\n\nSome bequests do not vest immediately upon death of the testator. For example, many wills specify that an heir who dies within a set period (such as 60 days) is not to inherit, and further specify how the corresponding share is to be distributed. This is generally done to obviate disputes over the precise time of death, and to avoid paying taxes twice in rapid succession should multiple members of a family die in the wake of a disaster. Such a bequest does not vest until the expiration of the specified period, because the actual heir cannot be determined with certainty.\n\nIt is also possible to give a person, A, a life interest in a property, with the remainder to go to another person or persons, B. If the beneficiary of the remainder cannot yet be known, then the remainder is said not to have vested, and the remainder is said to be contingent. This may happen with entailed estates, or when property is left in trust to care for a child or relative without heirs. (See trust law for details).\n\nVesting is an issue in conjunction with employer contributions to an employee stock option plan, deferred compensation plan, or to a retirement plan such as a 401(k), annuity or pension plan.\n\nA vested right is \"an absolute right; when a plan is fully vested, the employee has an absolute right to the entire amount of money in the account\". It is a \"basic right that has been granted, or has accrued, and cannot be taken away\"; for example. one has a right to a vested pension.\n\nGenerally, the portion \"vested\" cannot be reclaimed by the employer, nor can it be used to satisfy the employer's debts. Any portion not vested may be forfeited under certain conditions, such as termination of employment. The portion invested is often determined pro-rata.\n\nGenerally, for retirement plans in the United States, employees are fully vested in their own salary deferral contributions upon inception. For employer contributions, however, the employer has limited options under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to delay the vesting of their contributions to the employee. For example, the employer can say that the employee must work with the company for three years or they lose any employer contributed money, which is known as \"cliff vesting\". Or it can choose to have the 20% of the contributions vest each year over five years, known as \"graduated vesting\".\n\nChoosing a vesting plan allows an employer to selectively reward employees who remain employed for a period of time. In theory, this allows the employer to make greater contributions than would otherwise be prudent, because the money they contribute on behalf of employees goes to the ones they most want to reward.\n\nSmall entrepreneurial companies usually offer grants of common stock or positions in an employee stock option plan to employees and other key participants such as contractors, board members, advisors and major vendors. To make the reward commensurate with the extent of contribution, encourage loyalty, and avoid spreading ownership widely among former participants, these grants are usually subject to vesting arrangements.\n\nVesting of options is straightforward. The grantee receives an option to purchase a block of common stock, typically on commencement of employment, which vests over time. The option may be exercised at any time but only with respect to the vested portion. The entire option is lost if not exercised within a short period after the end of the employer relationship. The vesting operates simply by changing the status of the option over time from fully unexercisable to fully exercisable according to the vesting schedule.\n\nCommon stock grants are similar in function but the mechanism is different. An employee, typically a company founder, purchases stock in the company at nominal price shortly after the company is formed. The company retains a repurchase right to buy the stock back at the same price should the employee leave. The repurchase right diminishes over time so that the company eventually has no right to repurchase the stock (in other words, the stock becomes fully vested).\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, vesting periods in the United States are usually 3–5 years for employees, but shorter for board members and others whose expected tenure at a company is shorter. The vesting schedule is most often a pro-rata monthly vesting over the period with a six or twelve month cliff. Alternative vesting models are becoming more popular including milestone-based vesting and dynamic equity vesting.\n\nIn the case of both stock and options, large initial grants that vest over time are more common than periodic smaller grants because they are easier to account for and administer, they establish the arrangement up-front and are thus more predictable, and (subject to some complexities and limitations) the value of the grants and holding period requirements for tax purposes are set upon the initial grant date, giving a considerable tax advantage to the employee.\n\nProfit-sharing plans are usually vested in ten years, although in some cases a plan may serve essentially as a pension by allowing a limited amount of vesting should the employee retire or leave on good terms after an extended period of employment.\n\nThe vested rights doctrine is the rule of zoning law by which an owner or developer is entitled to proceed in accordance with the prior zoning provision where there has been a substantial change of position, expenditures, or incurrence of obligations made in good faith by an innocent party under a building permit or in reliance upon the probability of its issuance.\n\nA \"vesting period\" is a period of time an investor or other person holding a right to something must wait until they are capable of fully exercising their rights and until those rights may not be taken away.\n\nIn many cases vesting does not occur all at once. Specific portions of the rights grant vest on different dates over the duration of the period of the vesting. When part of a right is vested and part remains unvested, it is considered \"partly vested\".\n\nIn cases of partial vesting, a \"vesting schedule\" is a table or chart showing the portion of a right that is vested over time; typically the schedule provides for equal portions to vest on periodic vesting dates, usually once per day, month, quarter, or year, in stairstep fashion over the course of the vesting period. Often there is a cliff by which the first few steps in the graph are missing, so that there is no vesting at all for a period (usually six or twelve months in the case of employee equity), after which there is a cliff date upon which a large amount of vesting occurs all at once.\n\nSome arrangements provide for \"accelerated vesting\", by which all or a major portion of the unvested right vests all at once upon the occurrence of a specified event such as a termination of employment by the company or acquisition of the company by another. Less commonly, the vesting schedule may call for variable grants or subject to conditions such as reaching milestones or employee performance. \"Graded vesting\" (vesting after each year until the employee is fully vested) may be \"uniform\" (e.g., 20% of the compensation vested each year for five years) or \"non-uniform\" (e.g., 20%, 30%, and 50% of the compensation vested each year for the next three years).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42992088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42992088", "title": "Wrongful dismissal", "text": "Wrongful dismissal\n\nIn law, wrongful dismissal, also called wrongful termination or wrongful discharge, is a situation in which an employee's contract of employment has been terminated by the employer, where the termination breaches one or more terms of the contract of employment, or a statute provision or rule in employment law. Laws governing wrongful dismissal vary according to the terms of the employment contract, as well as under the laws and public policies of the jurisdiction.\n\nA related concept is constructive dismissal in which an employee feels no choice but to resign from employment for reasons that result from the employer's violation of the employee's legal rights.\n\nBeing terminated for any of the items listed below may constitute wrongful termination:\n\n\nThe absence of a formal contract of employment does not preclude wrongful dismissal in jurisdictions in which a \"de facto\" contract is taken to exist by virtue of the employment relationship. Terms of such a contract may include obligations and rights outlined in an employee handbook.\n\nMany jurisdictions provide tribunals or courts which that hear actions for wrongful dismissal. A proven wrongful dismissal will tend to lead to the award of one or both of the following remedies:\n\nOne way to avoid potential liability for wrongful dismissal with newer employees is to institute an employment probation period after which a new employee is automatically terminated unless there is sufficient justification not to do so. The dismissed employee may still assert a claim, but proof will be more difficult, as the employer may have broad discretion with retaining such a temporary employee.\n\nIn the United States, there is no single “wrongful termination” law. Rather there are several state and federal laws and court decisions that define this concept.\n\nIn all U.S. states except Montana, workers are considered by default to be at-will employees, meaning that they may be fired at any time without cause.\n\nSome employees have contracts of employment that limit their employers' ability to terminate them without cause. Other employees may be members of unions and benefit from a collective bargaining agreement that defines disciplinary proceedings and limits when an employee may be terminated. Employees who work for government agencies normally benefit from civil service protections that restrict termination. Those employees, if terminated, may attempt to bring wrongful termination claims under the terms of the contract or agreement, or civil service law.\n\nAlthough at-will employees are protected from termination by civil rights laws and other laws that prohibit retaliatory termination, in the absence of a contract of employment or collective bargaining agreement, or civil service protections extended to government workers, they have few protections from being fired.\n\nIn some situations an at-will employee may be able to claim wrongful termination. Three leading grounds for claiming wrongful termination are:\n\nA 2016 study found evidence that the implied-contract exception to at-will employment reduced state employment rates by 0.8% to 1.7%. The initial impact is largest for female and less-educated workers (those who change jobs frequently), while the longer-term effect is greater for older and more-educated workers (those most likely to litigate). By contrast, we find no robust employment or wage effects of two other widely recognized wrongful-discharge laws: the public-policy and goodfaith exceptions.\"\n\nIn the United States, termination of employment is not legal if it is based on your membership in a group protected from discrimination by law. It is unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee based upon factors including employee's race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, or age (over 40), pursuant to U.S. federal laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.\n\nMany states also have civil rights laws that protect workers from discrimination. For example, those forms of discrimination are prohibited by the California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).\n\nMany laws also prohibit termination, even of at-will employees. For example, whistleblower laws may protect an employee who reports a legal or safety violation by the employer to an appropriate oversight agency. Most states prohibit employers from firing employees in retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim, or making a wage complaint over unpaid wages.\n\nIn Canadian law, absent a written contract which addresses how to end the employment relationship, the law implies into the employment relationship a term that it will not be ended without \"notice\" of its termination.\n\nNotice is advanced warning an employer must provide an employee that their employment will be terminated. It is measured in units of time. The employer has the option to provide one of two kinds of notice:\n\nIf an adjudicator determines a dismissal was unjust, the employer may be ordered to reinstate the employee with or without compensation for lost wages, pay compensation for lost wages without reinstating the employee, or do anything that is equitable to remedy any consequences of the dismissal.\n\nWorking notice is legal in Canada. Therefore, if the employee is provided a reasonable amount of working notice, the employer owes the employee no additional money.\n\nPay in lieu of notice, sometimes referred to as termination pay, is the amount of money the employer must pay the employee if the employer seeks to immediately terminate the employee without working notice.\n\nEmployees may be entitled to either statutory or reasonable notice, which ever is greater, but at the very minimum, must receive statutory notice. Provincial legislation such as Ontario's Employment Standards Act, delineates statutory notice by way of a formula.\n\nReasonable notice, on the other hand, has no formula. The common law dictates how much reasonable notice an employee is entitled to. In this regard, the length of reasonable notice depends on a number of factors, best described by McRuer CJHC in the 1960 Ontario decision of \"Bardal v Globe & Mail\":\nThere could be no catalogue laid down as to what was reasonable notice in particular classes of cases. The reasonableness of the notice must be decided with reference to each particular case, having regard to the character of the employment, the length of the service of the servant, the age of the servant and the availability of similar employment, having regard to the experience, training and qualifications of the servant.\nAs the so-called \"Bardal Factors\" feature in hundreds of cases, predictive modeling is now possible. Notwithstanding the above, the courts are open to creative interpretations of reasonable notice. For example, if an employee was persuaded to leave a job to come to another (i.e. inducement), the courts may take that into account in calculating the employee’s length of service and thus drastically increase the notice period.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has significantly expanded the scope of wrongful dismissal in Canadian jurisprudence:\n\nAn employer is entitled to dismiss an employee according to the terms of the employment contract. There are oral employment contracts, and written employment contracts, and combinations of oral and written employment contracts. In Canadian common law, there is a basic distinction as to dismissals. There are two basic types of dismissals, or terminations: dismissal with cause and termination without cause. An example of cause would be an employee's behaviour which constitutes a fundamental breach of the terms of the employment contract. Where cause exists, the employer can dismiss the employee without providing any notice. If no cause exists yet the employer dismisses without providing lawful notice, then the dismissal is a wrongful dismissal. A wrongful dismissal will allow the employee to claim monetary damages in an amount that compensates the employee for the wages, commissions, bonuses, profit sharing and other such emoluments the employee would have earned or received during the lawful notice period, minus earnings from new employment obtained during the lawful notice period. In Canadian employment law, in those jurisdictions where a remedy for unjust dismissal is not available, it has long been the rule that reinstatement is not a remedy available to either the employer or the employeedamages must be paid instead.\n\nAlthough Canadian employment law provides some of the above remedies, each (provincial) jurisdiction may treat employment law differently. It is important to determine which jurisdiction the employment occurs in or is regulated by, then seek appropriate legal advice relevant to that jurisdiction and its particular employment laws.\n\n"}

The company was founded in 2013 by David Back and Greg Moran. As of February 2017, the company operates in 27 cities across the country.\n\nAmerican duo David Back & Greg Moran, met while studying at the University of Pennsylvania, where both graduated in 2007. After graduating, Back studied at Harvard Law School and Moran worked on energy financing projects. The pair also went on to business school with full scholarships, Moran at the University of Southern California and Back at the Judge Business School at Cambridge University.\n\nBack and Moran both dropped out of business school to move to India and pursue a venture in car rentals. In May 2015, Back resigned from the self-drive car rental company, and decided to move back to the US citing personal reasons.\n\nZoom officially launched operations in Bangalore in February 2013. Zoom started with $215,000 in capital and a fleet of seven cars.\n\nZoom initially raised capital from individual investors including Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, Chair of the UK Institute of Directors Lady Barbara Judge, Vice-Dean of International Legal Studies at Harvard Law School William P. Alford, Wharton Statistics Chair Edward George, and the former Director of the Cambridge Centre for Entrepreneurial Studies Shai Vyakarnam. Back met Summers at Harvard University, where Back was a teaching assistant to Summers.\n\nZoomcar's institutional investors include: Ford Motor Company, Sequoia Capital, Nokia Growth Partners, FundersClub, Basset Investment Group, Athene Capital, Empire Angels, Venture Souk, OurCrowd, Globevestor., and Cyber Carrier CL. Zoomcar has also raised money from former Infosys CFO T.V. Mohandas Pai and his business partner Abhay Jain.\n\nAt Ford's investor day presentation in September 2016, CEO Mark Fields described difficulties with Ford's prior strategy in India, but commented \"Our new mobility business could be a factor that plays in there. That's why you saw us about a month ago take an equity position in Zoomcar, which is the largest car sharing service in India.\"\n\nZoomcar faces competition from Drivezy, MylesCars (backed by Carzonrent) and other similar car rental companies.\n\nZoom partners with the auto manufacturers like Ford & Mahindra which allowed them to become the first car rental company in India to offer an electric vehicle (the Mahindra REVA E2O by Mahindra) and the Ford EcoSport \"urban SUV by Ford\" in 2013. Zoom also works with locally established real estate developers, universities, hotels, and corporate IT parks to secure parking for its vehicles and offer pick-up points to its members.\n\nIn November 2013, Zoom, Uber (a cab booking mobile app provider) and the Ashoka Foundation came together and launched a month-long campaign in Bangalore called RideSmartBLR to encourage car-rental and discourage drunk driving for its health, economical and environmental benefits.\n\nZoom was a member of Microsoft's Accelerator Plus program in Bangalore in Spring 2014. This program is designed to provide more tailored assistance to later-stage start-ups as they scale their business and raise capital.\n\nIn July 2015, Zoomcar issued caution information to its customers following opposition from the Ladakh taxi union. Following an incident in which a convoy of 15 cars rented from the company was reportedly attacked by members of the union with stones and iron rods, Zoomcar issued a cautionary mail to customers traveling to Khardung La and Nubra valley. The following week Zoom issued an update stating that the situation had aggravated and the company urged extreme caution to customers traveling to the region. The taxi unions of Gulmarg and Ladakh continue to resist entry of non-local commercial cars in the region.\n\nIn December 2015, the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) banned 54 controversial Indian ads which included a video advertisement by Zoomcar. The ad was found to be in violation of India's Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 by the council, following which the advertisement was pulled off by the company.\n\n"}
