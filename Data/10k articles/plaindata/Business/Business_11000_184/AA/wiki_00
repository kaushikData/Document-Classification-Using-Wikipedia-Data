It comprises the area that made up the City of Philadelphia prior to the Act of Consolidation, 1854 which extended the city borders to be coterminous with Philadelphia County. Greater Center City has grown into the second-most populated downtown area in the United States, after Midtown Manhattan in New York City, with an estimated 183,240 residents in 2015.\n\nCenter City is bounded by South Street to the south, the Delaware River to the east, the Schuylkill River to the west, and Vine Street to the north. This means that Center City occupies the boundaries of the city before it was made coterminous with Philadelphia County in 1854. The Center City District, which has special powers of taxation, uses a complicated, irregularly shaped boundary that includes much but not all of this area, and also extends beyond it. The Philadelphia Police Department patrols three districts located within Center City. The three patrol districts serving Center City are the 6th, 9th, and 17th districts.\n\nAmong Center City's neighborhoods and districts are Penn's Landing, Old City, Society Hill, South Street, Washington Square West, Market East, Chinatown, Logan Square, the Museum District (located along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway), Rittenhouse Square, Fitler Square, the Avenue of the Arts (South Broad Street), and Jewelers' Row.\n\nCenter City is home to most of Philadelphia's tallest buildings, including Philadelphia's City Hall, the second tallest masonry building in the world and until 1987 the tallest in Philadelphia, as well as the tallest building in the world for seven years. In March 1987, One Liberty Place broke the gentlemen's agreement not to exceed the height of the statue of William Penn atop City Hall. Since the completion of One Liberty Place, no Philadelphia major-league sports team had won a world championship for the next two decades, a phenomenon known as the \"Curse of Billy Penn.\" In an effort to reverse the curse, a 3-foot statue of Penn was affixed to the top of the Comcast Center upon its completion as the city's new tallest building in 2007. On October 29, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies won the 2008 World Series, effectively ending the \"curse\"\n\nSeven other skyscrapers now exceed the height of Penn's statue, including One Liberty Place's little sister, Two Liberty Place. The Comcast Center, which was completed in 2007, is now the tallest building in Pennsylvania, 30 feet taller than One Liberty Place. Two buildings now under construction — 1441 Chestnut and the Comcast Technology Center — are also slated to be taller than City Hall. The latter would be the eighth-tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, and the tallest outside Manhattan and Chicago. The first publicly accessible vantage point higher than City Hall opened at One Liberty Observation Deck on the 57th floor of One Liberty Place in 2015.\n\nOther Center City skyscrapers include the BNY Mellon Center and the Three Logan Square, which houses a traffic camera used by the Philadelphia branch of the Westwood One MetroNetworks traffic service.\n\nAcross the street from City Hall is the Masonic Temple, the headquarters of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, a legacy of the Founding Fathers and signers of the Declaration of Independence, many of whom were Freemasons; such luminaries include George Washington and Benjamin Franklin.\n\nWhile Philadelphia's population declined, Center City's rose 10% between 1990 and 2000.\n\nIn 2007, the city designated the area bound by 11th Street, Broad Street, Chestnut Street and Pine Street as the Gayborhood.\n\n\nSunoco has its headquarters in the BNY Mellon Center.

His parents were Archibald Cary and Monimia (née Fairfax) Cary. His sister, the author Constance Cary, was married to Burton Harrison, the former private secretary for Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Through his sister, he was the uncle of Fairfax Harrison, who was a President of the Southern Railway Company, and Francis Burton Harrison, who served as a Governor-General of the Philippines. The family lived at Cumberland, Maryland, where his father was editor of its leading newspaper, \"The Cumberland Civilian\". \n\nHis paternal grandparents were Wilson Jefferson Cary and Virginia (née Randolph) Cary. His maternal grandparents were Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (who never assumed the English title) and Margaret (née Herbert) Fairfax, herself the granddaughter of John Carlyle and Sarah Fairfax. Cary was also the great-grandnephew of Thomas Jefferson. Among his large and prominent family members was uncle Gouverneur Morris of \"Morrisania\", who married Anne Cary Randolph.\n\nWhen Archibald died in 1854, his mother moved the family to his grandmother's plantation, known as Vaucluse in Fairfax County, Virginia. Following the outbreak of the Civil War, Vaucluse was seized and torn down to construct Fort Worth as a part of the defenses of Washington, D.C.. The family moved again to Richmond, Virginia, staying there during the War. \n\nDuring the War, Cary served as a midshipman in the Confederate States Navy and reportedly, \"did some very clever acting during the war on the amateur stage and on the naval war boards. In his sailor role he served on the blockade runner, \"Nashville\", on the \"Palmetto State\" ironclad, off the Carolina coast and on the James River fleet, proving himself a good officer.\"\n\nAfter the war, he studied law and practiced in New York, founding the successful firm of Cary & Whitridge, where he was a trusted advisor to Varina Davis, the widow of Jefferson Davis. Following his brother-in-law Harrison's return to the United States after the Civil War, they practiced law together. \n\nCary was a fan of Oriental culture and art, traveling for extended periods to the Far East, setting up a committee with other businessmen known as the \"Committee on American Interests in China.\" He was known for ridiculing Secretary of State John Sherman by calling Sherman's reluctance to Chinese trade as \"quaint and dangerous\". He worked as the legal counsel for the American China Development Company, and helped found the American Asiatic Association in 1898.\n\nIn 1892, Cary and his wife were included in Ward McAllister's \"Four Hundred\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in \"The New York Times\". Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.\n\nHe also translated several of the classic Latin poets, particularly Horace.\n\nIn 1878, Cary was married to Elisabeth Miller Potter (1856–1945), the daughter of Howard Potter, a diplomat and investment banker with Brown Bros. & Co., and his wife, Mary Louisa (née Brown) Potter.

{"id": "36910423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36910423", "title": "Customer delight", "text": "Customer delight\n\nCustomer delight is surprising a customer by exceeding his or her expectations and thus creating a positive emotional reaction. This emotional reaction leads to word of mouth. Customer delight directly affects sales and profitability of a company as it helps to distinguish the company and its products and services from the competition.\nIn the past customer satisfaction has been seen as a key performance indicator. Customer satisfaction measures the extent to which the expectations of a customer are met (compared to expectations being exceeded). However, it has been discovered that mere customer satisfaction does not create brand loyalty nor does it encourage positive word of mouth.\n\nCustomer delight can be created by the product itself, by accompanied standard services and by interaction with people at the front line. The interaction is the greatest source of opportunities to create delight as it can be personalized and tailored to the specific needs and wishes of the customer. During contacts with touch points in the company, more than just customer service can be delivered. The person at the front line can surprise by showing a sincere personal interest in the customer, offer small attentions that might please or find a solution specific to particular needs. Those front-line employees are able to develop a relationship between the customer and the brand. Elements in creating motivated staff are: recruiting the right people, motivating them continuously and leading them in a clear way.\n\nThere are three objectives when implementing Customer Delight:\nThe effect of achieving those objectives, according to Reichheld as described in The Ultimate Question 2.0, only 9% of the world’s major firms achieve real sustainable profit and growth over 10- year period from 1999 to 2009. Customer Delight is the only kind of growth that can be sustained over the long term according to Reichheld and Markey. The authors mention that their company Bain & Company have researched and concluded that a 5% increase in customer retention could yield anywhere between 25% to 100% increase in profits. The book explains the Net Promoter Score; a system which measures what customers are feeling and thus creating accountability for the customer experience.\n\nIn order to consistently deliver Customer Delight at all customer touch points throughout the company, a customer-centric corporate culture is key. With this corporate culture all processes, systems, people and leadership are aligned: everyone in the organization shares the same set of values, attitudes and practices. Developing the culture is a continuous exercise of innovation and improvement, involving every employee of the company. An absolutely necessary step is linking Customer Delight behaviour to the core values of the brand. Core values are operating principles that guide an organization’s internal conduct as well as its relationship with customers, partners and shareholders. Once core values are clearly outlined it is critical to incorporate them into every process, from hiring, to employee appraisals and decision making.\n\n\n"}

Jensen spent much of his formative youth in Addis Abba, Ethiopia before returning to the United States in 1965. He dropped out of a secondary school at the age of 16. Influenced by his grandfather's cafe, Jensen's Cafe, Jensen entered the restaurant business as a busboy. Jensen's parents were supportive of his endeavors from an early age. Jensen started his buffet career working as a manager at Sirloin Stockade and Ponderosa and Bonaza Steakhouse in Iowa in the 1970s. After the death of his grandfather, 20-year-old Doron felt ready to take over his grandfather's cafe in Fremont, Nebraska. His parents helped arrange the takeover of the restaurant, but was blocked by other relatives that thought he was too young for the responsibility. Jensen briefly attended the University of Minnesota.\n\nJensen was brought into Old Country Buffet by Roe Hatlen and C. Dennis Scott in 1983. Jensen opened the first restaurant in St. Cloud, Minnesota in 1983. In 1984, Jensen starting opening more locations in the Twin Cities Metropolitan area, eventually expanding its reach outside of Minnesota. Jensen began opening its restaurants along the eastern seaboard, but disagreements began among company leadership whether to expand into the American South. Disagreements within the company continued regarding southern United States expansion, and eventually led to Jensen and major investor and construction magnate Dermot Rowland to leave the company to start their own buffet chain, Homestyle Buffet. Shortly after Jensen's departure, \"Forbes\" recognized Old Country Buffett as one of the \"200 best small companies in the United States\" before becoming the largest buffet chain in the world posting revenues of $808.5 million and $868.9 million by the 1990s. Jensen cited his \"youth and entrepreneurial spirit\" as reasons why he left the company so early in its development.\n\nJensen left Old Country Buffett to lead what would become Homestyle Buffet. At just the age of 28, Jensen opened Homestyle Buffets Inc. and incorporated them in Clearwater, Florida in 1986. He took the company public on December 1, 1988. Jensen expanded the reach of the company outside of Florida and across the eastern seaboard and eventually into New England. However, Jensen left the company after just 40 restaurants to return to the Midwest to pursue other ventures.\n\nWhile in Florida, Jensen was influenced by the developing steakhouse concept that would eventually become Outback Steakhouse. Jensen decided to return to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he founded the company Q-Steaks Inc as the umbrella company for Minnesota Steakhouse in January 1991. Again, Jensen took his company public. Timber Lodge Steakhouse went public on January 1, 1993. Jensen changed the name to Timber Lodge Steakhouse in 1994 when the company's reach expanded outside of Minnesota, with the exception of Paul Bunyan's in New York. In 1995, he resigned as President of the company, again leaving a company that he had founded. Later, Jensen along with Outback Steakhouse founder, Chris T. Sullivan, would be attributed with rebooting the American steakhouse concept.\n\nSince Timber Lodge Steakhouse, Jensen has primarily focused on signature restaurants over large-scale restaurant chains. Jensen developed the signature restaurant Q-Cumbers in Edina, Minnesota and later developed his own personal brand of self-titled restaurants Jensen's Cafe, Jensen's Supper Club, and Jensen's food & cocktails. Jensen's Cafe is named in honor of his grandfather's original Jensen's Cafe in Fremont, Nebraska.\n\nJensen's concepts and designs have been cited as influence for other restaurant brands such as Minervas food & cocktails and Hazelwood food & drinks.\n\nJensen was elected as the President of the interest group the Minnesota Restaurant Association in 2000. Jensen's career has also included lobbyist efforts representing the National Restaurant Association in Washington, DC. He has also served on various commerce boards in Minnesota.\n\nDoron Jensen is the son of American theologian Richard A. Jensen and Bonnie L. Jensen.

{"id": "4796861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4796861", "title": "Evidence-based management", "text": "Evidence-based management\n\nEvidence-based management (EBMgt) is an emerging movement to explicitly use the current, best evidence in management and decision-making. Its roots are in empiricism as seen in evidence-based-practice, aiming to apply \"scientific method\" to evaluating practice.\n\nEvidence-based management entails managerial decisions and organizational practices informed by the \"best available\" evidence. As with other evidence-based practice, this is based on the three principles of: 1) published peer-reviewed (often in management or social science journals) research evidence that bears on whether and why a particular management practice works; 2) judgement and experience from contextual management practice, to understand the organization and interpersonal dynamics in a situation and determine the risks and benefits of available actions; and 3) the preferences and values of those affected.\n\nWhile, like its counterparts in medicine, and education EBMgt considers the circumstances and ethical concerns managerial decisions involve, it tends not to make extensive use of behavioral science relevant to effective management practice.\n\nAn important part of EBMgt is educating current and future managers in evidence-based practices. The EBMgt website maintained at Stanford University provides a repository of syllabi, cases, and tools that can inform the teaching of evidence-based management.\n\nEfforts to promote EBMgt face greater challenges than have other evidence-based initiatives. In medicine there is more consensus as to what constitutes best evidence than in the social sciences more generally, and management in particular. Unlike medicine, nursing, education, and law enforcement, \"Management\" is not a profession. There are no established legal or cultural requirements regarding education or knowledge for an individual to become a manager. Managers have diverse disciplinary backgrounds. A college degree may be required for an MBA – but not to be a manager. No formal body of shared knowledge characterizes managers, making it unlikely that peer pressure will be exerted to promote use of evidence by any manager who refuses to do so. Little shared language or terminology exists, making it difficult for managers to hold discussions of evidence or evidence-based practices. For this reason, the adoption of evidence-based practices is likely to be organization-specific, where leaders take the initiative to build an evidence-based culture. Practices an evidence-based organizational culture employs include systematic accumulation and analysis of data gathered on the organization and its functioning, problem-based reading and discussion of research summaries by managers and staff, and the making of organizational decisions informed by both best available research and organizational information. Organizations successfully pursuing evidence-based management typically go through cycles of experimentation and redesign of their practices to create an evidence-based culture consistent with their values and mission.\n\nAlthough some advocates of EBMgt argue that it is more likely to be adopted in knowledge-intensive organizations, recent research at the University of Oxford into six leading organizations in the healthcare industry found that managers and clinical leaders used a variety of forms of knowledge, drawing on academic research, experiential knowledge and respected colleagues. The researchers concluded that skilful 'knowledge leadership' is crucial in translating EBMgt and other academic research into practice in ways that are relevant and can be mobilized in specific organizational contexts.\n\nOrganizations adopting agile approaches in their product development, often find they need to make changes in other areas to reap the full benefits of the changes (the growing field of business agility and agile transformation). Evidence-based management provides a more structured approach to working through such change in short-cycles; to focus investments in areas that will bring the greatest value soonest; and to provide a framework for evaluating their success.\n\nThe concept of evidence-based policy and practice within international development is similarly being emphasized regarding the management of development projects and activities. For instance, in a literature review focused on development, an integrated, participatory, structured and empowering approach to using evidence and data in decision-making to inform development decisions was tied to improved results. \n\nThe weak form alternatives to evidence-based anything include hearsay, opinion, rhetoric, discourse, advice (opinion), self deception, bias, belief, fallacy, or advocacy. The stronger forms include concerns about what counts as evidence, types of evidence, what evidence is available, sought or possible, who decides and pays for what evidence to be collected, and that evidence needs to be interpreted. Also there are the limitations to empiricism as well argued in the historical debate between empiricism and rationalism which is usually assumed to be resolved by Immanuel Kant by saying the two are inextricably interwoven. We reason what evidence is fair and what the evidence means (Critique of Practical Reason).Critical theorists have raised objections to the claims made by those promoting evidence-based management. In particular, EBMgt has been criticised for treating \"evidence\" and \"scientific method\" as if they were neutral, value-free descriptions. From this perspective, what counts as \"evidence\" is considered as intrinsically problematic and contested because there are different ways of looking at social problems. Furthermore, in line with perspectives from critical management studies, \"management\" is not necessarily an automatic good thing—it often involves the exercise of power and the exploitation of others. Efforts have been made, however, to include a balanced treatment of such issues in reviewing and interpreting the research literature for practice. Criticisms persist, and critical theorists say fundamental problems with evidence-based management have been ignored.\n\nOne potential alternative to the evidence-based approach is use of dialectic, argument, or public debate (argument is not to be confused with advocacy or quarreling). Aristotle in works like Rhetoric, reasons that the way to test knowledge claims was to set up an inquiry method where a sceptical audience was encouraged to question evidence and its assumptions. To win an argument, convincing evidence is required. Calls for argumentative inquiry, or the argumentative turn may be fairer, safer and more creative than calls for evidence-based approaches.\n\nSome of the publications in this area are \"Evidence-Based Management\", \"Harvard Business Review\", and \"Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths and Total Nonsense: Profiting From Evidence-Based Management\". Some of the people conducting research on the effects of evidence-based management are Jeffrey Pfeffer, Robert I. Sutton, and Tracy Allison Altman. Pfeffer and Sutton also have a website dedicated to EBMgt.\n\nEvidence-based management is also being applied in specific industries and professions, including software development. Other areas are crime prevention (Sherman et al. (2002), public management, and manufacturing.\n\n\n"}

The cemetery's history dates back to the mid-18th century, when it was designated as a burial ground by Major Ephraim Hildreth before his death in 1740. Though located within the Lowell city limits, it is actually administered by the nearby town of Dracut because the cemetery was built when Centralville was still a part of Dracut.\n\nIn 1913, the City of Lowell attempted to sell the cemetery after the Town of Dracut neglected to pay a tax on a new sidewalk on Hildreth Street; this would have resulted in the forced relocation of many of the remains at the cemetery. After an injunction in Suffolk County court to prevent the sale, the town continues to maintain the cemetery. The nearby private cemetery containing the graves of General Benjamin Butler and his wife, Sarah Hildreth, was not affected.\n\nOn October 3, 2009, a teenager from Centralville became angry over a \"personal matter\" and damaged over 150 headstones in Hildreth Cemetery, many of them around two centuries old. 90 of them were damaged beyond repair due to age or the materials they were made from (some older ones carved in slate, others in marble). The cost of the damage was estimated to be around $10,000. The Hildreth Family Cemetery, gated and locked all year, was untouched. The perpetrator turned himself in two weeks later upon seeing pictures of the destroyed headstones in the \"Lowell Sun\".\n\nIn June 2010, the town of Dracut authorized the allocation of $30,000 towards the repair of Hildreth Cemetery, so that the work would begin before the winter. In October, work began on the restoration. Several stones were repaired on site, as they were merely knocked over or were easily repaired, but those damaged beyond repair were flagged for replacement by Hudson Monuments in Hudson, New Hampshire. Much of the work was completed by March 2011.\n\nThe Hildreth family's private cemetery is set behind the public cemetery and entered via two locked gates accessible only from Hildreth Street. The cemetery is closed all year, with the exception of the annual commemoration of General Butler's birthday and the replacement of the flag, held the first Sunday in November.\n\nSeveral generations of the Hildreth family are buried in the cemetery.

It is based in Nashville, Tennessee and manages 178 hospitals and approximately 1,800 sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics in the United States and United Kingdom. HCA went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1969 followed by a substantial growth period for the next two decades. The company was ranked No. 63 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.\n\nIn 1993, lawsuits were filed against HCA by former employees who drew attention to the company's questionable billing practices to Medicare for hundreds of millions of dollars. Some of the allegations included charging the government costs for running its hospitals, paying kickbacks to physicians for referrals, and unlawfully charging for costs involving wound care facilities. A federal probe ensued, spanning nearly a decade, and culminated in 2003 with \"the government receiving a total of over $2 billion in criminal fines and civil penalties for systematically defrauding federal health care programs.\" The federal probe has been referred to as the longest and costliest investigation for health-care fraud in U.S. history.\n\nHCA was founded in 1968, in Nashville, Tennessee by Dr. Thomas F. Frist Sr., Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr. and Jack C. Massey.\n\nThe first hospital that HCA owned was Park View Hospital, near downtown Nashville. The small group of founders worked out of a small house not far from Park View for the first few years of operation.\n\nIn 1969, HCA conducted its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As HCA grew, the small house that served as office space was no longer large enough, and in 1972, they built new offices behind Nashville's Centennial Park.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s the corporation went through a tremendous growth period acquiring hundreds of hospitals across the US, 255 owned by HCA, and another 208 managed by HCA.\n\nIn 1988, the hospital operator was acquired for $5.1 billion in a management buyout led by chairman Thomas F. Frist, Jr. and completed a successful initial public offering in 1992. In 1993 HCA merged with Louisville-based Columbia Hospital Corporation to form Columbia/HCA. In April 1998, Birmingham, Alabama-based HealthSouth Corporation announced it was acquiring the majority of HCA's surgical division.\n\nIn 2006, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Bain Capital, together with Merrill Lynch and the Frist family (which had founded the company) completed a $33.6 billion acquisition, making the company privately held again, 17 years after it had first been taken private in a management buyout. At the time of its announcement, the HCA buyout was the first of several to set new records for the largest, eclipsing the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco. It would later be surpassed by the buyouts of Equity Office Properties and TXU.\n\nIn May 2010, HCA announced that the corporation would once again go public with an expected $4.6-billion IPO. In March 2011, HCA sold 126.2 million shares for $30 each, raising about $3.79 billion, at that time, the largest private-equity backed IPO in U.S. history.\n\nMilton Johnson is the current CEO of HCA.\n\n, HCA operated 178 hospitals and approximately 1,800 sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding ERs, urgent care centers, and physician clinics located in 20 U.S. states and in the United Kingdom. In July 2007, HCA sold its hospitals in Switzerland.\n\nThe main hospital sites within the United Kingdom include:\n\nIt opened urgent care walk-in centres at London Bridge Hospital and the Portland Hospital in March 2018. They claim that patients, on average, wait just seven minutes to see a nurse and 17 minutes to see a doctor.\n\nThe Princess Grace Hospital specializes in breast cancer and surgery, aided by Professor Kefah Mokbel and Dr. Nick Perry who, in 2005, founded The London Breast Institute.\n\nIn 1993, lawsuits were filed by former employees regarding alleged improprieties in HCA's billing of Medicare which amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars. With federal investigations still underway, HCA was acquired by Columbia Healthcare; their growth and expansion continued under the company's founder Rick Scott. In 1997, amid growing evidence that HCA \"had kept two sets of books, one to show the government and one with actual expenses listed\" Scott resigned, and became a venture capitalist. Thomas Frist, a co-founder of HCA and brother of US Senator Bill Frist, took Scott's place.\n\nIn March 1997, investigators from the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services served search warrants at Columbia/HCA facilities in El Paso and on dozens of doctors with suspected ties to the company. Following the raids, the Columbia/HCA board of directors forced Rick Scott to resign as chairman and CEO. He was paid a settlement of $9.88 million and left with 10 million shares of stock worth over $350 million, mostly from his initial investment. In 1999, Columbia/HCA changed its name back to HCA, Inc. HCA also admitted fraudulently billing Medicare and other health programs by inflating the seriousness of diagnoses and to giving doctors partnerships in company hospitals as a kickback for the doctors referring patients to HCA. They filed false cost reports, fraudulently billing Medicare for home health care workers, and paid kickbacks in the sale of home health agencies and to doctors to refer patients. In addition, they gave doctors \"loans\" that were never intended to be repaid as well as free rent, free office furniture, and free drugs from hospital pharmacies.\n\nAfter Scott stepped down, Frist Jr. returned as chairman and CEO. He called on longtime friend and colleague Jack O. Bovender, Jr., to help him turn the company around. Frist and Bovender, who became CEO in 2001, pulled off what \"Fortune\" magazine called a remarkable corporate rescue. In settlements reached in 2000 and 2002, Columbia/HCA pleaded guilty to 14 felonies and admitted systematically overcharging the government by claiming marketing costs as reimbursable, striking illegal deals with home care agencies, and filing false data about use of hospital space.\nIn late 2002, HCA agreed to pay the U.S. government $631 million, plus interest, and pay $17.5 million to state Medicaid agencies, in addition to $250 million paid up to that point to resolve outstanding Medicare expense claims. In all, civil lawsuits cost HCA more than $2 billion to settle. The name subsequently reverted to \"Hospital Corporation of America.\" HCA abandoned the use of its name in its home market and instead promotes its Nashville hospitals under the TriStar brand. The federal investigations, which spanned nearly a decade, drew to a close in 2003 with \"the government receiving a total of over $2 billion in criminal fines and civil penalties for systematically defrauding federal health care programs.\" The case has been referred to as the longest and costliest investigation for health-care fraud in U.S. history.\n\nIn July 2005, U.S. Senator Bill Frist sold all of his HCA shares two weeks before disappointing earnings sent the stock on a 9-point plunge. Frist claimed that he sold his shares to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest if he ran for president. Other executives sold their stock at the same time. Shareholders sued HCA and alleged that the company made false claims about its profits to drive up the price, which then fell when the company reported disappointing financial results. Eleven of HCA's senior officers were sued for accounting fraud and insider trading. HCA settled the lawsuit in August 2007, agreeing to pay $20 million to the shareholders.\n\nThe Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County gave $1 million to HCA for \"moving expenses\" into their new building in North Gulch in 2014. By 2018, HCA had spent the amount on office furniture, leading to concerns on the part of council member Erica Gilmore, who blamed it on Nashville's Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency, and the Beacon Center of Tennessee.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15382", "title": "Invisible balance", "text": "Invisible balance\n\nThe invisible balance or balance of trade on services is that part of the balance of trade that refers to services and other products that do not result in the transfer of physical objects. Examples include consulting services, shipping services, tourism, and patent license revenues. This figure is usually generated by tertiary industry. The term 'invisible balance' is especially common in the United Kingdom.\n\nFor countries that rely on service exports or on tourism, the invisible balance is particularly important. For instance the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia receive significant international income from financial services, while Japan and Germany rely more on exports of manufactured goods.\n\nInvisibles are both international payments for services (as opposed to goods), as well as movements of money without exchange for goods or services. These invisibles are called 'transfer payments' or 'remittances' and may include money sent from one country to another by an individual, business, government or non-governmental organisations (NGO) – often charities.\n\nAn individual remittance may include money sent to a relative overseas. Business transfers may include profits sent by a foreign subsidiary to a parent company or money invested by a business in a foreign country. Bank loans to foreign countries are also included in this category, as are license fees paid for the use of patents and trademarks. Government transfers may involve loans made or official aid given to foreign countries, while transfers made by NGO's include money designated for charitable work within foreign countries, respectively.\n\nIn many countries a useful distinction is drawn between the balance of trade and the balance of payments. 'Balance of trade' refers to the trade of both tangible (physical) objects as well as the trade in services – collectively known as exports and imports (in other words, 'visibles plus services') – while the 'balance of payments' also includes transfers of Capital in the form of loans, investments in shares or direct investment in projects.\n\nA nation may have a visibles balance surplus but this can be offset by a larger deficit in the invisibles balance (creating a Balance of Trade deficit overall) – if, for example, there are large payments made to foreign businesses for invisibles such as shipping or tourism. On the other hand, a Visibles Balance deficit can be offset by a strong surplus on the invisibles balance if, for example, foreign aid is being provided.\n\nIn a similar way, a nation may also have a surplus 'balance of trade' because it exports more than it imports but a negative (or deficit) 'balance of payments' because, it has a much greater shortfall in transfers of capital. And, just as easily, a deficit in the 'balance of trade' may be offset by a larger surplus in capital transfers from overseas to produce a balance of payments surplus overall.\n\nProblems with a country's balance of trade (or balance of payments) are often associated with an inappropriate valuation of its currency, its country's foreign exchange rate.\n\nIf a country's exchange rate is too high, its exports will become uncompetitive as buyers in foreign countries require more of their own currency to pay for them. In the meantime, it also becomes cheaper for the citizens of the country to buy goods from overseas,as opposed to buying locally produced goods), because an overvalued currency makes foreign products less expensive.\n\nThe simultaneous decline in currency inflows from decreased exports and the rise in outflows, due to increased imports, sends the balance of trade into deficit, which then needs to be paid for by a transfer of funds in some form, either invisible transfers (aid, etc.) or capital flows (loans, etc.). However, relying on funds like that to support a trade deficit, is unsustainable, and the country may eventually require its currency to be devalued.\n\nIf, on the other hand, a currency is undervalued, its exports will become cheaper and therefore more competitive internationally. At the same time, imports will also become more costly, stimulating the production of domestic substitutes to replace them. That will result in a growth of currency flowing into the country and a decline in currency flowing out of it, resulting in an improvement in the country's balance of trade.\n\nBecause a nation's exchange rate has a big impact on its 'balance of trade' and its 'balance of payments', many economists favour freely floating exchange rates over the older, fixed (or pegged) rates of foreign currency exchange. Floating exchange rates allow more regular adjustments in exchange rates to occur, allowing the greater opportunity for international payments to maintain equilibrium.\n"}

{"id": "23932822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23932822", "title": "Merge in transit", "text": "Merge in transit\n\nMerge-in-transit (MIT) is a distribution method in which several shipments from suppliers originating at different locations are consolidated into one final customer delivery. This removes the need for distribution warehouses in the supply chain, allowing customers to receive complete deliveries for their orders. Under a merge-in-transit system, merge points replace distribution warehouse. In today's global market, merge-in-transit is progressively being used in telecommunications and electronic industries. These industries are usually dynamic and flexible, in which products have been developed and changed rapidly.\n\nMerge-in-transit allows company to assemble and transport goods simultaneously. It aims to remove the needs for distribution warehouse in the supply chain, targets at cutting down the amount of inventory stored in firm warehouses into zero, and allows customers to receive complete deliveries of their orders. Thus, transportation expenses can be lowered. From customer perspective, merge-in-transit provides value since it facilitates the delivery of a single and consolidated shipment rather than multiple smaller shipments. This also helps firms to reduce the overall inventory and process lean manufacturing.\n\nThere are basically two ways of approaching merge-in-transit, either merging and forwarding or synchronization. Merge-in-transit depends on several factors, including the availability of multiple vendors for a customer, regularity of shipments to the customers, order size and the availability of a strategically located merge point. When these elements have been identified, a MIT operation can be created.\nA logistics company receives the goods from multiple origins, and assembles them at a single point near a customer, which is called \"merge point\" or \"merge centre\". Shippers pick up separate shipments from several suppliers and deliver them to a location near their final destination (merge points), where a merge process is being undertaken. However, no colossoal inventory is stored at these merge points. This kind of just-in time sequence delivery shorten the time required to consolidate, which allows an efficient delivery to customers. For example, a company bought electronic devices from three sources in Southwest Michigan. Instead of paying for three separate lorries from Southwest Michigan to Phoenix, the three shipments can be combined in Southwest Michigan, followed by a single lorry to Phoenix.\n\nMerge-in-transit can also be regarded as a synchronization of production, in which logistics and transportation operation prevents stocking of final products. Various shipments of goods will be delivered from multiple vendors, which they are all delivered to the customers at the same time. Synchronization is different from merging and forwarding, which the former neglects consolidation process.\n\nMerge-in transit has various advantages comparing to the traditional method, which includes the following:\n\nIncrease in flexibility\n\nMerge points can often be start-up expeditiously and cheaply, depending on the type of merge-in-transit system. MIT system simplifies the receiving and deposit processes by eliminating various shipments and receipts, making it accessible for manufacturer and supplier to work together.\n\nElimination of redundant transportation\n\nThe transportation time can be diminished as there are no double shipments of goods from the suppliers to the principal and the principal to the customer. Goods can be sent to the customer directly and instantly from the vendor to the customer, without the principal looking at the product.\n\nReduction of inventory\n\nThe most direct benefit is the reduced inventory that used to sustain the system. Many organizations target cut their inventories to zero by the replacement of merge points, whereby they no longer require warehouses to store inventory. For example, Micron technology does not store monitors or printers in their own warehouse.\n\nCurtail transportation and administration costs\n\nProducts are handled less frequently in merge-in-transit system due to the reduction of transportation and Inventory. Receiving and storing are not required as the products do not actually go into inventory. Also, goods are delivered directly to the customer rather than the principal then to the customer. Even the locations of merge points are placed near the customer. Consequently, the transportation and inventory costs could be exceedingly low.\n\nHeighten supply chain visibility\n\nManufactures can take advantages of point of sale data, forwarding the information decoupling points further back upstream and allowing deferment both in time and form. Hence, the orders and material flows are separated. These may further reduce uncertainty and cost of forecasting.\n\nImproved customer services\n\nMerge-in-transit enables delivery to take place more rapidly, which aids the firms to generate the ability of improving customer service. Customers have the opportunity to choose among a wider variety of products and a larger pool of suppliers due to the withdrawal of inventory and the increased flexibility. The distributor may also provide better customer service by broadening its product assortment.\n\nLower capital requirements\n\nMerge-in-transit demands lesser capital investment as it does not need to store inventory in a warehouse. With regard of this, firms might spend fewer resources to deliver goods to the customer, which benefits small and medium firms with limited capital.\n\nMerge-in transit has several disadvantages over the traditional way, which includes the followings.\n\nAdvanced information systems requirement\n\nThe merge-in-transit system necessitates with a considerable alteration and investment in information technology and innovation processes. These system and development do not come without corresponding investments, containing an escalation of costs that might be arduous to recover from firm's revenue.\n\nRise in overall cost\n\nMerge-in-transit system involves multiple loadings and unloading of consignments. This has the potential risk of increasing the overall cost if it is not optimized correctly, which the more times consignments is transiting, the higher the cost.\n\nPoor on-time delivery\n\nGiven that the time allowance is only a few days, in which each time period is commensurate with one day. Under merge-in-transit system, the firms will not schedule early or late arrivals to customers. They may easily impede and amend the delivery time. Hence, they have to provide compensations to the customers.\n\nEscalate in complexity\n\nAs the requirements for coordination of orders and material flows are becoming more intensified, the complexity of distribution will be increased. Thus, firms might often create distribution problems such as sending the wrong items and out of stocks of certain products. In addition, increasing customer orders will lead to a double of time for accessible products since there are not enough stocks available, leading to the situation that the supply does not meet with the demand in the customer order cycle.\n\nLack of inventory\n\nUnder the merge-in-transit system, there is little or zero inventory stored in a company, which aids to cut costs. However, inventory sometimes can be regarded as an advantage. For example, if a strike occurs within the company, without the stored inventory, the company will bear risks of paying compensation or closing down by the failure in delivering customer orders on time. In this regard, reduction of inventory is detrimental to firms.\n\nVicious circle of delay distribution\n\nMerge-in-transit system involves consolidated deliveries. The system relies heavily on the assumptions that the vendors will fulfill the order-filling operation at the identical level of efficiency and cooperation between vendors, which might involve risks. For example, a postponement in receiving a shipment form a vendor at the merge point would undoubtedly delay the shipment to the end of customer.\n\nLosing brand recognition\n\nThere is a potential problem that dealer other than the organization of the brand will gain brand recognition under merge-in-transit system. Unless the products has been consolidated properly in outlook with other elements, there might be a risk that dealer might gain control of the customer for further sales. This is one of the main reasons that merge-in-transit component products gather commodities, rather than differentiated or customized products from the dealers.\n\nDell computers, UPS worldwide, Starbucks coffees, Cisco System, Fedex and Micron are example of companies using merge-in-transit system.\n\nDell is an American multinational computer technology organization.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) is the world's largest package delivery company and a provider of supply chain management solutions.\n\n\nStarbucks is an American coffee company. It is now the largest coffeehouse company in the world.\n\n\nCisco Systems is an American multinational technology company that designs, sell and manufactures networking equipment.\n\nFedEx is an American global courier delivery services company.\n\n\nMicron Technology is an American multinational corporation, producing multiple forms of semiconductor devices, including dynamic random-access memory, flash memory, and solid-state drives. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1211498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1211498", "title": "Ricardo Semler", "text": "Ricardo Semler\n\nRicardo Semler (born 1959 in São Paulo) is the CEO and majority owner of Semco Partners, a Brazilian company best known for its radical form of industrial democracy and corporate re-engineering. Under his ownership, revenue has grown from 4 million US dollars in 1982 to 212 million US dollars in 2003 and his innovative business management policies have attracted widespread interest around the world. \"Time\" featured him among its Global 100 young leaders profile series published in 1994 while the World Economic Forum also nominated him. \"The Wall Street Journal\" \"America Economia\", The Wall Street Journal's Latin American magazine, named him Latin American businessman of the year in 1990 and he was named Brazilian businessman of the year in 1990 and 1992. \"Virando a Própria Mesa\" (\"Turning the Table on Yourself\"), his first book, became the best selling non-fiction book in the history of Brazil. He has since written two books in English on the transformation of Semco and workplace re-engineering: \"Maverick\", an English version of \"Turning Your Own Table\" published in 1993 and an international bestseller, and \"The Seven-Day Weekend\" in 2003.\n\nSemler went to work for his father's company, originally called Semler & Company, then a mixer and agitator supplier in São Paulo. Semler clashed with his father, Antonio Semler, who supported a traditional autocratic style of management whereas young Semler favoured a decentralised, participatory style. Furthermore, Ricardo favoured diversification away from the struggling shipbuilding industry, which his father opposed.\n\nAfter heated clashes, the son threatened to leave the company. Rather than see this happen, Antonio Semler resigned as CEO and vested majority ownership in his son in 1980 when Ricardo was 21 years old. On his first day as CEO, Ricardo Semler fired sixty percent of all top managers. He began work on a diversification program to rescue the company. Semler experienced health issues, culminating in a fainting spell at a pump factory (Baldwinsville, New York) when he was 25. After seeing a doctor at the Lahey Clinic (Boston), he was diagnosed with an advanced case of stress. This inspired him to want a greater work-life balance for himself and his employees.\n\nAttempts to introduce a matrix organisational structure in 1986 failed to achieve desired improvements. \n\nIn the late 1980s, three engineers at Semco proposed setting up a Nucleus of Technological Innovation (NTI) to develop new businesses and product lines which Semler endorsed. At the end of the first six months, NTI had identified 18 such opportunities. Following the success of this initiative, satellite units were encouraged throughout Semco. By the late 1980s, these satellite units accounted for two-thirds of its new products and two-thirds of its employees.\n\nAn assessment of Semler's business philosophy through phenomenological analysis (within the radical change of Semco's management style), led Bombała to conclude that it was an \"...excellent exemplification of good leadership.\" Eleanor Glor notes that the only accounts about the change in management style come from Ricardo Semler himself, rather than from the affected workers.\n\nAfter dramatic restrictions on liquidity instituted by Brazilian president Fernando Collor de Mello to combat hyperinflation in 1990, the Brazilian economy went into a severe downturn, forcing many companies to declare bankruptcy. Workers at Semco agreed to wage cuts, providing their share of profits was increased to 39%, management salaries were cut by 40% and employees were given the right to approve every item of expenditure.\n\nPerforming multiple roles during the crisis gave workers greater knowledge of the operations and more suggestions on how to improve the business. Reforms implemented during that time led to 65% reduction in inventories, a marked reduction in product delivery times and a product defects rate that fell to less than 1%. As the business climate improved, Semco's revenues and profitability improved dramatically.\n\n, Semco had annual revenue of $212 million, up from $4 million in 1982 and $35 million in 1994, with an annual growth rate of up to 40 percent a year. It employed 3,000 workers in 2003, as opposed to 90 in 1982. The company's units include:\n\nAs Semco grew, Ricardo Semler received a great deal of recognition. He was named Brazilian businessman of the year in 1990 and in 1992, and the World Economic Forum named him as one of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow. A high-profile committee appointed by \"CIO Magazine\" featuring Tom Peters, Jim Champy and Michael Hammer selected Semco as one of the most successfully re-engineered companies in the world. The BBC included Semco in its series on \"Reengineering the Business\" for creating one of the most successful management structures in business.\n\nSemler has reduced his involvement in Semco in the past decade to pursue other activities. He wrote a book \"Maverick\" on his experience at Semco which became a worldwide bestseller in 1993.\n\nHis second book, \"The Seven-Day Weekend: Changing the Way Work Works\" was published in 2003.\n\nHe has appeared in the media around the world and speaks regularly to business schools, businesses and groups to promote his philosophy of industrial democracy.

{"id": "3254324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3254324", "title": "Robert Durst", "text": "Robert Durst\n\nRobert Alan Durst (born April 12, 1943) is an American real estate heir, the son of New York City mogul Seymour Durst, and the elder brother of Douglas Durst, head of the Durst Organization. He is suspected of murdering three individuals in different states: Kathleen McCormack Durst, his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Susan Berman, his longtime friend, who was killed in California in 2000; and his neighbor, Morris Black, who was killed in Texas in 2001. Durst was the subject of a multi-state manhunt and was ultimately convicted of dismembering Black, but acquitted of his murder.\n\nOn March 14, 2015, Durst was arrested in New Orleans on a first-degree murder warrant signed by a Los Angeles judge in relation to the Berman killing. On November 4, 2016, he was transferred to California and soon after was arraigned in Los Angeles on first-degree murder charges. A preliminary hearing was initially scheduled for October 2017 but was postponed to April 2018 and concluded in October 2018 with Los Angeles Country Superior Judge Mark Windham ruling there is enough evidence to try Durst for the shooting of Berman.\n\nOne of four children, Robert Durst grew up in Scarsdale, New York. He is the son of real estate investor Seymour Durst and his wife Bernice Herstein. His siblings are Douglas, Tommy, and Wendy. Durst's paternal grandfather, Joseph Durst, a penniless Jewish tailor when he emigrated from Austria-Hungary in 1902, eventually became a very successful real estate manager and developer, founding the Durst Organization in 1927. Seymour Durst became head of the family business in 1974 upon his father's death.\n\nWhen Robert was seven, his mother died as a result of a fall from the family's Scarsdale home; he later claimed that, moments before her death, his father walked him to a window from which he could see her standing on the roof. In a March 2015 \"New York Times\" interview, however, his brother Douglas denied this. As children, Robert and Douglas underwent counseling for sibling rivalry; a 1953 psychiatrist's report on 10-year-old Robert mentioned \"personality decomposition and possibly even schizophrenia\".\n\nDurst attended Scarsdale High School, where classmates described him as a loner. He earned a bachelor's degree in Economics in 1965 from Lehigh University, where he was a member of the varsity lacrosse team and the business manager of \"The Brown and White\" student newspaper. He enrolled in a doctoral program at UCLA later that year, where he met Susan Berman, but eventually withdrew from the school and returned to New York in 1969. Durst went on to become a real estate developer in his father's business; however, it was his brother Douglas who was later appointed to run the family business in the 1990s. The appointment caused a rift between Robert and his family, estranging him from them.\n\nPolice have directly questioned Durst, and sometimes conducted searches, in connection to the disappearance of his first wife Kathie McCormack, and two homicides, Susan Berman and Morris Black. In one of those homicides, he was tried and acquitted.\n\nIn the fall of 1971, Durst met Kathleen McCormack, a dental hygienist, whose nickname was \"Kathie\". After two dates, Durst invited McCormack to share his home in Vermont, where he had opened a health food store; she moved there in January 1972. However, Durst's father pressured him to move back to New York City to work in the family real estate business. Durst and McCormack returned to Manhattan, where they married in April 1973.\n\nShortly before her disappearance, McCormack was a student in her fourth and final year at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in The Bronx and was only a few months short of earning her degree. She had intended to become a pediatrician. McCormack was last seen by someone other than Durst the evening of January 31, 1982, at her best friend's dinner party in Newtown, Connecticut. She had arrived unexpectedly and her friend noticed she was upset. She was also wearing red sweatpants, which the friend found odd since McCormack had often dressed in much better quality clothing. She later left for South Salem, New York, after a call from her husband. Although the couple argued and fought, Durst maintained that he put his wife on a train to New York City, had a drink with a neighbor, and spoke to his wife by telephone later that evening. \"That's what I told police,\" Durst later told documentary filmmakers. \"I was hoping that would just make everything go away.\"\n\nAfter McCormack had left her friend's house, she was supposed to meet her friend at a pub called The Lion's Gate in Manhattan. When she failed to show up, her friend became concerned and repeatedly called the police for several days. Days later, Durst filed a missing person report as well. A doorman at one of the two Manhattan apartments where the couple lived claimed to have seen McCormack there on February 1, which was one day after she was last seen, but also claimed that he had seen her only from behind and couldn't be 100% sure that it was her.\n\nMcCormack had been treated at a Bronx hospital for facial bruises three weeks before. She told a friend that Durst beat her, yet she did not press charges over the incident. McCormack asked Durst for a $250,000 divorce settlement. Durst cancelled his wife's credit card, removed her name from a joint bank account, and refused to pay her medical school tuition. At the time his wife disappeared, Durst had been dating Prudence Farrow for three years and was living in a separate apartment. Durst initially offered $100,000 for his wife's return, then reduced the reward to $15,000. Only three weeks after reporting her missing, he was seen discarding his wife's possessions, which he denied. When McCormack's friend and sister had heard she was reported missing, they broke into her cottage hoping to find her. Instead, they found the cottage ransacked and McCormack's mail left unopened. They then became afraid and left.\n\nAfter McCormack went missing, police said that Durst had claimed to have last spoken to her when she called him at their cottage from Manhattan. He claimed that the last time he had seen her was at Katonah train station, where she was planning to board a 21:15 train to Manhattan. He also claimed that on February 4, the supervisor at her medical school called him and said that she had called in sick on February 1 and was absent from class for the entire week. It is uncertain if it was indeed McCormack who made the call. The day after Durst received the call from McCormack's medical school, he reported her as missing. The police found his stories to be full of contradictions.\n\nThe McCormack family now wants Kathleen declared dead as they strongly believe she is deceased. Her mother, Ann McCormack, had before attempted to sue Durst for $100 million. Kathleen's parents are now deceased. Kathleen's younger sister, Mary McCormack Hughes, also believes that Durst killed her. The New York State Police quietly re-opened the criminal investigation into the disappearance in 1999, searching Durst's former South Salem residence for the first time. The investigation became public in November 2000.\n\nOn December 24, 2000, Berman, a longtime friend of Durst who had facilitated his public alibi after McCormack's disappearance and who had recently received $50,000 from Durst, was found murdered execution-style in her home in Benedict Canyon, California. Durst is known to have been in Northern California days before Berman was killed, and to have flown from San Francisco to New York the night before Berman's body was discovered. Although Durst confirmed to the LAPD that he had recently sent Berman $25,000, and faxed investigators a copy of her 1982 deposition regarding his missing wife, he declined to be further questioned about Berman's murder.\n\nDurst said in a 2005 deposition that Berman called him shortly before her death to say that Los Angeles police wanted to talk to her about McCormack's disappearance. A study of case notes by \"The Guardian\" cast doubt on whether the LAPD had made such a call, or whether then-Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro had scheduled an interview with Berman at all. Durst moved to Galveston, Texas, in 2000, lived in a boarding house, and began posing as a woman to avoid police inquiries. Durst had been tipped off to the re-opened investigation into his wife's disappearance on October 31, 2000, and immediately began planning for life as a fugitive. Berman biographer Cathy Scott has asserted that Durst killed Berman because she knew too much about McCormack's disappearance.\n\nOn October 9, 2001, Durst was arrested in Galveston shortly after body parts belonging to his elderly neighbor, Morris Black, were found floating in Galveston Bay. He was released on $300,000 bail the next day. Durst missed a court hearing on October 16 and a warrant was issued for his arrest on a charge of bail jumping. On November 30, he was caught inside a Wegmans supermarket in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, after trying to shoplift a chicken salad sandwich on pumpernickel bread, Band-Aids, and a newspaper, even though he had $500 cash in his pocket. A police search of his rented car yielded $37,000 in cash, two guns, marijuana, Black's driver's license, and directions to the Connecticut home of Gilberte Najamy, a former confidante of McCormack who had dogged Durst for years publicizing accusations he had murdered his wife. Durst also used his time on the run to stalk his brother Douglas, visiting the driveway of his home in Katonah, New York, while armed. Durst employed defense attorney John Waldron while he was held on charges in Pennsylvania. He was eventually extradited to Texas for trial. \n\nIn 2003, Durst was tried for the murder of Black. He employed defense attorney Dick DeGuerin and claimed self-defense; DeGuerin conducted two mock trials in preparation for the case. Durst's defense team had difficulty communicating with him, so they hired psychiatrist Dr. Milton Altschuler to find out why. Altschuler spent over 70 hours examining Durst and diagnosed him with Asperger syndrome, saying, \"His whole life's history is so compatible with a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder.\" Durst's defense team argued at trial that the diagnosis explained his behavior.\n\nDurst claimed he and Black, a cranky and confrontational loner, struggled for control of Durst's .22-caliber target pistol after Black grabbed it from its hiding place and threatened him with it. During the struggle, the pistol discharged, shooting Black in the face. During cross-examination, Durst admitted to using a paring knife, two saws, and an axe to dismember Black's body before bagging and dumping his remains in Galveston Bay. Black's head was never recovered, so prosecutors were unable to present sufficient forensic evidence to dispute Durst's account of the struggle. As a result of lack of forensics, the jury acquitted Durst of murder.\n\nIn 2004, Durst pleaded guilty to two counts of bail jumping and one count of evidence tampering. As part of a plea bargain, he received a sentence of five years and was given credit for time served, requiring him to serve three years in prison. Durst was paroled in 2005. The rules of his release required him to stay near his home; permission was required to travel. That December, Durst made an unauthorized trip to the boarding house where Black had been killed and to a nearby shopping mall. At the mall, he ran into former Galveston trial judge Susan Criss, who had presided over his trial. Due to this incident, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles determined that Durst had violated the terms of his parole and returned him to jail. He was released again from custody on March 1, 2006.\n\nAsked in March 2015 whether she believed Durst murdered Morris Black, Criss commented: \"You could see that this person knew what they were doing and that it was not a first time. The body was cut perfectly like a surgeon who knew how to use this tool on this bone and a certain kind of tool on that muscle. It looked like not a first-time job. That was pretty scary.\"\n\nOn March 16, 2015, DeGuerin advised court authorities in New Orleans that his client waived extradition and would voluntarily return to California. Late that same day, Louisiana State Police filed charges against Durst for being a felon in possession of a firearm and for possession of a firearm with a controlled substance, forestalling his immediate return to California. Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro commented that, in light of prior convictions that could influence Durst's sentencing, \"[j]ust for those gun charges here in Louisiana, [Durst] could face up to life in prison\".\n\nOn March 23, Durst was denied bail by a Louisiana judge after prosecutors argued he was a flight risk. In an effort to hasten his extradition to California and avoid a protracted Louisiana court battle, DeGuerin raised questions about the validity of the New Orleans arrest and hotel room search, pointing out that a local judge did not issue a warrant until hours after his client was detained. While communicating with the LAPD and conducting an inventory of Durst's hotel room possessions, \"[t]he FBI ... held him there, incommunicado, for almost eight hours\". According to DeGuerin, Durst was questioned extensively by a Los Angeles prosecutor and detective, without a lawyer present, on the morning after his arrest.\n\nIn failing to produce the arresting officers subpoenaed for a probable cause hearing, Durst's attorneys charged that Louisiana prosecutors engaged in a \"misguided attempt to conceal the facts from the court, the defendant, and the public.\" Peter Mansfield, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, said that his office instructed the two FBI agents and arresting officer not to appear, arguing that DeGuerin's subpoenas were issued in an attempt to conduct \"actions against them in their official capacities for the purpose of obtaining testimony, information and material maintained under color of their official duties.\"\n\nOn April 8, a day after the U.S. Attorney filed an independent federal weapons charge, Durst was formally indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for carrying a weapon with a controlled substance and for the illegal possession of a firearm by a felon. Later that month, Durst's lawyers requested that more than $161,000 seized by authorities during their searches be returned, saying the cash \"is not needed as evidence, is not contraband, and is not subject to forfeiture.\"\n\nAfter negotiations with Durst's defense team, Louisiana authorities ultimately dropped weapons charges against Durst on April 23, 2015. Durst's trial on the federal weapons charge was scheduled for September 21, 2015. DeGuerin confirmed rumors that Durst was in poor health, stating that he suffers from hydrocephalus and had a stent put into his skull two years before, as well as spinal surgery and a cancerous mass removed from his esophagus.\n\nDurst's attorneys requested a later date for the federal weapons charge trial, saying they'd need more time to prepare after rulings on pending motions. U.S. District Judge Helen Berrigan later rescheduled the trial to January 11, 2016. On November 16, 2015, a New Orleans federal judge ordered Durst re-arraigned on the weapons charges and scheduled a hearing for December 17. When asked, Durst's attorney said only that Durst did not kill Berman, and that he wants to resolve the other charges to expedite Durst's extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge.\n\nOn December 16, 2015, prosecutors and defense attorneys told Berrigan in a joint motion that scheduling conflicts ruled out all dates before a January 11 trial date. Berrigan ultimately rescheduled the trial for February 3, 2016, and Durst changed his plea to guilty to the federal gun charge and received an 85-month prison sentence.\n\nA few days after a first-degree murder warrant was signed by a Los Angeles judge in relation to the Berman killing, Durst was arrested by FBI agents on March 14, 2015, at the Canal Street Marriott in New Orleans, where he had registered under the false name \"Everette Ward\". Durst, who had been tracked to the hotel after making two calls to check his voicemail, was observed wandering aimlessly in the lobby and mumbling to himself, having driven to New Orleans from Houston four days before.\n\nIn addition to a .38 revolver loaded with four live rounds and one spent shell casing, police recovered five ounces of marijuana, Durst's birth certificate and passport, maps of Louisiana, Florida, and Cuba, a \"flesh-toned\" latex mask, the fake Texas ID used to check into the hotel, a new cellphone, and cash totaling $42,631. Police discovered a UPS tracking number, which led to an additional $117,000 cash in a package sent to Durst by a friend in New York, which was seized after his arrest. Bank statements found in one of Durst's Houston condominiums revealed cash withdrawals of $315,000 in little more than a month.\n\nOn March 15, 2015, New York State Police investigator Joseph Becerra, long involved with the McCormack case, and said to be working closely in recent months with the FBI and Los Angeles detectives, removed some sixty file boxes of Durst's personal papers and effects from the home of Durst's friend Susan T. Giordano in Campbell Hall, New York, where they had been sent by his present wife Debrah Lee Charatan three years prior for safekeeping. Also stored there were videotaped depositions of Durst, Charatan, and Douglas Durst, all related to the Black case.\n\nLos Angeles County Deputy District Attorney John Lewin, in charge of prosecuting Durst, claimed to have found information uncovered by the filmmakers in the HBO documentary series \"The Jinx\" to be compelling and repeatedly flew to New York to interview witnesses, including friends of Durst and Berman. The trial was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles after Durst was arraigned in California, but his transfer was delayed by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons due to \"serious surgery\", according to DeGuerin. Durst pleaded not guilty on November 7, 2016. The trial was postponed to April 16, 2018, to accommodate Durst's defense team, some of whom suffered damage to their homes and offices from Hurricane Harvey. The pretrial hearings included extensive testimony from a number of older witnesses who potentially would not be available when the trial itself begins. In October 2018, Los Angeles Country Superior Judge Mark Windham ruled there is enough evidence to try Durst for the murder of Berman, and Durst will be arraigned November 8, 2018. The following day during his court appearance, Durst pled not guilty.\n\nThe death date for Kathleen Durst has been changed to be most likely at the time she disappeared in 1982 due to murder instead of the previous determination of 1987 for a missing person.\n\nDays after the Berman murder, police were reportedly examining connections between Durst and disappearances of 17-year-old Lynne Schulze from Middlebury, Vermont, and 16-year-old Karen Mitchell from Eureka, California. Investigators are also looking into a possible connection with the disappearance of 18-year-old Kristen Modafferi, last seen in San Francisco in 1997.\n\nSchulze, a Middlebury College freshman, visited Durst's health food store on December 10, 1971, the day she disappeared, and was last seen that afternoon near a bus stop across from the store. DeGuerin characterized the Schulze investigation as \"opportunistic\" and said he would not permit his client to be questioned by Vermont police. Author and investigative journalist Matt Birkbeck reported in 2003, and again in his 2015 book \"A Deadly Secret\", that credit card records placed Durst in Eureka on November 25, 1997, the day Mitchell vanished. Mitchell may have volunteered in a homeless shelter that Durst frequented; Durst, dressed in women's clothing, had visited the Eureka shoe store owned by Mitchell's aunt. Mitchell was last seen walking to work from her aunt's store and possibly speaking to someone in a stopped car; a witness sketch of Mitchell's presumed abductor resembles Durst.\n\nAlthough the FBI ultimately could not connect Durst to the Long Island serial murders (in which some victims were disposed similarly to the Black killing), the Bureau created an informal task force in 2012 to work with investigative agencies in jurisdictions where Durst was known to have lived in past decades, including Vermont, New York, and California. In the wake of his recent arrest, the FBI encouraged such localities to re-examine cold cases. Texas private investigator Bobbi Bacha has also traced Durst operating under stolen identities in Texas, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Virginia.\n\nIn early 2015, a six-part HBO documentary titled \"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\" described circumstantial evidence linking Durst to the murder of Berman, who was believed to have knowledge of McCormack's disappearance. The documentary detailed the disappearance of McCormack, Berman's subsequent death, and the killing of Black. Against the advice of his lawyers and his wife Debrah Lee Charatan, Durst gave multiple interviews and unrestricted access to his personal records to the filmmakers. The FBI arrested Durst in New Orleans on the same day as the final episode was broadcast. The documentary ended with him moving into a bathroom where his microphone recorded him saying to himself: \"There it is. You're caught! What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported that a March 1999 letter from Durst to Berman, discovered by her stepson and turned over to the filmmakers during their research, provided \"key new evidence\" leading to the filing of murder charges.\n\nOn April 12, 1973 – Durst's 30th birthday – he married Kathleen McCormack. Durst divorced her in 1990, eight years after her disappearance, claiming spousal abandonment. On December 11, 2000, shortly before the Berman killing, Durst married Debrah Lee Charatan. According to \"The New York Times\", the couple briefly shared a Fifth Avenue apartment in 1990 but \"have never lived together as husband and wife\". Durst once told his sister that it was \"a marriage of convenience\"; \"I wanted Debbie to be able to receive my inheritance, and I intended to kill myself,\" Durst said in a 2005 deposition. Charatan currently lives with one of Durst's lawyers, Steven I. Holm.\n\nDurst traveled and lived under dozens of aliases over the years, using different identities to buy cars, rent apartments, and open credit card accounts. \"He had a scanner, copier, and a laminating machine,\" a former office employee of Durst told \"Newsweek\". \"What I didn't realize is that I unwittingly saw what would have allowed Robert Durst to make a fake driver's license.\" Durst was also \"a prolific user of private mailboxes,\" and apparently conducted business under a number of canine-themed names: Woofing LLC, WoofWoof LLC, and Igor-Fayette Inc.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Durst owned a series of seven Alaskan Malamutes each named Igor, which according to his brother Douglas all died under mysterious circumstances. In December 2014, prior to the airing of \"The Jinx\", Douglas told \"The New York Times\" that, \"In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing [of] his wife with those dogs.\" Durst was once recorded saying he wanted to \"Igor\" Douglas. Durst, however, has disputed the notion that he owned seven dogs named Igor; he owned three, he said, one that was run over and another that died in surgery after eating an apple core, \"before the Igor that lasted forever.\"\n\nIn late 1981, while Durst was still married to McCormack, he was nearing the end of a three-year affair with Prudence Farrow, who was also married at the time. A few months before McCormack's disappearance in January 1982, Farrow called her and asked that she give him up, as friends said she wanted him all to herself. After Durst's acquittal of murdering Black in 2003, Farrow contacted law enforcement authorities with concerns for her safety, as she said Durst was angry with her for terminating their relationship three days before McCormack disappeared.\n\nIn mid 2002, Durst signed over a power of attorney to his wife Charatan, a real estate investor, and it is believed their holdings remain closely intermingled. In 2006, Durst gave Charatan around $20 million of his $65 million trust settlement.\n\nIn 2011, Durst purchased a $1.75 million townhouse on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. A source close to his estranged family confirmed that he was living there at least some of the time, and they were keeping him under surveillance. Durst also owns three condominiums in a multi-story complex in Houston, and after filing suit, received a $200,000 settlement in 2006 from a Houston developer who refused to let him move into a unit newly purchased by his wife, which she had then immediately resold to Durst for $10. At the time of Berman's murder in Los Angeles, Durst had just sold a home in Trinidad, California, but maintained an office in Eureka while renting in nearby Big Lagoon.\n\nMedia have variously reported Durst's financial status as \"real estate baron\", \"rich scion\", \"millionaire\", \"multimillionaire\", and \"billionaire\". The Durst family's real estate holdings are worth more than $4 billion, but his brother Douglas was in control of the company beginning in 1994, shortly before their father's death. From about 1994 to 2006, Robert waged a legal campaign to gain greater control of the family trust and fortune. During that time he received $2 million a year from the trust. In 2006 the case was settled, with Durst giving up any interest in his family's properties and trusts in exchange for a one-time payment of about $65 million. It is unknown how much of that went to legal fees and taxes. Durst was still active in real estate; he reportedly sold two properties in 2014 for $21.15 million after purchasing them in 2011 for $8.65 million. At the time of his 2015 arrest, the FBI estimated Durst's net worth at approximately $100 million; \"The New York Times\" estimated his net worth at $110 million.\n\nOn May 1, 2015, the \"New York Post\" reported that Douglas had settled litigation against \"Jinx\" filmmaker Andrew Jarecki, having confirmed that Robert was the source of videotaped depositions that appeared in the documentary. Robert's disclosure apparently violated the terms of his 2006 agreement with the Durst family, which had dispersed to him a lump sum of family trust assets. Although it was unclear whether Jarecki confirmed Robert as his source—\"The New York Times\" reported in March 2015 that Jarecki was given \"unrestricted access\" to Robert's personal records, including the videotaped material—the settlement paves the way for Douglas to reclaim as much as $74 million of his brother's assets, effectively freezing those assets pending court judgment. This could affect Robert's ability to pay for high-caliber legal representation without tapping into real estate or other investments. The \"Post\" reported that Douglas was \"mulling his next move\".\n\nIn November 2015, nearly 34 years after her disappearance, McCormack's three sisters and 101-year-old mother sued Durst for $100 million, citing his apparent role in her murder and his denial to her family of the \"right to sepulcher\", a New York law that grants immediate relatives access to a deceased person's body and the opportunity to determine appropriate burial. If successful, the lawsuit could deprive Durst of most or all of his inherited fortune. McCormack's brother James had attempted in October 2015 to file a wrongful death suit against Durst on behalf of his mother, but was challenged by one of his sisters, who holds her mother's power of attorney. DeGuerin commented that \"there is no evidence that Robert Durst had anything to do with Kathleen's disappearance. Anybody can file a lawsuit, but eventually they'll have to come with evidence.\" On December 7, 2015, the same family members filed a suit asking the court to freeze Durst's assets. The family's attorney, Robert Abrams, called Durst the \"poster child\" for why courts block defendants from disposing assets while civil lawsuits are pending. In July 2016, the McCormack family asked the Surrogate’s Court in Manhattan to \"declare that Kathie died on January 31, 1982, when she was murdered by her husband, Robert Durst\" so the sepulcher lawsuit can proceed.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Durst's family members sought and received restraining orders against him, claiming they were afraid of him. Durst was charged with trespassing in New York for walking in front of townhouses owned by his brother Douglas and other family members. He went on trial and was acquitted in December 2014. The judge also vacated the thirteen orders of protection his family members had taken out on him.\n\nIn July 2014, Durst was arrested after turning himself in to police following an incident at a Houston CVS drugstore in which he allegedly exposed himself without provocation and urinated on a rack of candy. He then left the store and casually walked down the street. Durst was charged with misdemeanor criminal mischief. In December 2014, he pleaded \"no contest\" and was fined $500. His lawyer described the incident as an \"unfortunate medical mishap\", as Durst had just been released from a hospital where he had undergone two medical procedures. The incident was recorded on videotape.\n\n\n\n"}

A shareholder primacy approach often gives shareholders power to intercede directly and frequently in corporate decision-making, through such means as unilateral shareholder power to amend corporate charters, shareholder referenda on business decisions and regular corporate board election contests. The shareholder primacy norm was first used by courts to resolve disputes among majority and minority shareholders, and, over time, this use of the shareholder primacy norm evolved into the modern doctrine of minority shareholder oppression. James Kee writes, \"If private property were truly respected, shareholder interest would be the primary, or even better, the sole purpose, of the corporation.\"\n\nThe doctrine of shareholder primacy is criticized for being at odds with corporate social responsibility and other legal obligations because it focuses solely on maximizing shareholder profits .\n"}

It marked Humphrey Bogart's final film role. The film was nominated for Best Cinematography, Black and White for Burnett Guffey at the 29th Academy Awards. Joseph Ruttenberg for Somebody Up There Likes Me, however, got the award.\n\nSportswriter Eddie Willis is broke after the newspaper he works for goes under. He is hired by boxing promoter Nick Benko. He recruits Toro Moreno, an Argentinian boxer. Unbeknownst to Toro and his manager Luís Agrandi, all of his fights had been fixed to make the public believe that he is for real. Toro challenges Gus Dundee, a champion boxer who died of a brain hemorrhage, after losing to Buddy Brannen. Eddie hesitates to promote Toro. Despite the misgivings of his wife, Benko convinced him otherwise, due to Eddie's attempted pay-day. Feeling guilty, Toro wishes to return to Argentina, but Eddie convinces him to work together. In the meantime, Benko plans to use Toro and places the bet against any champion boxers. Eddie teaches Toro on how to hit one of the handlers. While fighting with Brannen, Toro ends up having a broken jaw. When Eddie takes the money owed to him and Toro, he finds out that Benko has rigged the accounting and Toro earns $49.07. Ashamed, Eddie sends Toro home to Argentina with their share of the proceeds, $26,000. Eddie writes the exposure about the corruption.\n\n\nIn early 1956, Bogart was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and he died on January 14, 1957. Steiger said:\n\n\"Bogey and I got on very well. Unlike some other stars, when they had closeups, you might have been relegated to a two-shot, or cut out altogether. Bogey didn't play those games. He was a professional and had tremendous authority. He'd come in exactly at 9am and leave at precisely 6pm. I remember once walking to lunch in between takes and seeing Bogey on the lot. I shouldn't have because his work was finished for the day. I asked him why he was still on the lot, and he said, 'They want to shoot some retakes of my closeups because my eyes are too watery'. A little while later, after the film, somebody came up to me with word of Bogey's death. Then it struck me. His eyes were watery because he was in pain with the cancer. I thought: 'How dumb can you be, Rodney'!\"\n\nThe film was released with two different endings: one where Eddie Willis (inspired by Harold Conrad) demanded that boxing be banned altogether, and the other where he merely insisted that there be a federal investigation into boxing. The video version contains the \"harder\" ending, while most television prints end with the \"softer\" message. Occasionally inaudible in a take, some lines are reported to have been dubbed in post-production by Paul Frees.\n\nThe film premiered at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. \"The New York Times\" film critic, Bosley Crowther, liked the film, writing, \"It's a brutal and disagreeable story, probably a little far-fetched, and without Mr. Schulberg's warmest character—the wistful widow who bestowed her favors on busted pugs. But with all the arcana of the fight game that Mr. Yordan and Mr. Robson have put into it—along with their bruising, brutish fight scenes—it makes for a lively, stinging film.\" Dennis Schwartz wrote, \"The unwell Bogie's last film is not a knockout, but his hard-hitting performance is terrific as a has-been sports journalist out of desperation taking a job as a publicist for a fight fixer in order to get a bank account ... The social conscience film is realistic, but fails to be shocking or for that matter convincing.\"\n\nPrimo Carnera sued Columbia with $1.5 million for privacy invasion of the film.\n\n\n"}

Martin was the land agent of the Northern Neck Proprietary for his uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1693–1781) and served two terms in the House of Burgesses.\n\nMartin was born in Kent in 1731, and was the grandson of Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1657–1710) through his mother, Frances Fairfax Martin. Raised in humble surroundings in England, Martin relocated to Virginia in 1751 to assist his uncle, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax), in administering the Northern Neck Proprietary, which encompassed up to . Martin resided with his uncle on their frontier Greenway Court estate in present-day Clarke County, Virginia. He earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature and loyalty, and through Martin's growing influence Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary's base of operations to Greenway Court in 1762 and made Martin steward and land agent of the proprietary.\n\nMartin took an active role in political and civil affairs within the proprietary's domain. He served as a vestryman for the Anglican Frederick Parish, and upon the creation of Hampshire County in 1754, he presided as the county's first justice and was further appointed the County Lieutenant. He later represented Hampshire County in the House of Burgesses from 1756 to 1758 and serving with George Washington, represented Fredrick County from 1758 until 1761. Martin was appointed a trustee of the frontier towns of Winchester, Stephensburg (present-day Stephens City), and Bath (present-day Berkeley Springs). He was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia. Though not in the best of health, Martin was relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources in response to Native American attacks. Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Martin refused reappointment by Governor Patrick Henry as a justice of the Frederick County Commission of Peace. Afterward, Martin retreated from civil service entirely, and retired to Greenway Court.\n\nHe maintained a low profile during the war, and his uncle Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration despite being the only resident peer in the American colonies. Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Martin's brother Reverend Denny Martin Fairfax inherited the Northern Neck Proprietary, and Martin was given the Greenway Court estate. He took his uncle's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress and died unmarried in 1798. Martin bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining to his housekeeper Betsy Powers. Martin's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly maintain the proprietary and conveyed the remaining lands in 1797, thus terminating the Fairfax and Martin families' interests in the proprietary before it was formally dissolved in 1806. The city of Martinsburg, West Virginia, was named for Martin by his friend Adam Stephen.\n\nThomas Bryan Martin was born in Kent, England, in 1731 and was the son of Denny Martin (1695–1762) of Salts Manor and his wife Frances Fairfax Martin (1703–1791). His father and mother married in Loose, Kent. Martin's mother was the daughter of Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1657–1710) and his wife Catherine Colepeper Fairfax, and thus a sister of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1693–1781) and Robert Fairfax, 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1707–1793). His grandmother Catherine Colepeper Fairfax was the daughter of Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper and his wife Margaretta van Hesse, who was from a Dutch noble family. Martin was named in honor of his uncle Thomas. He was baptized into the Anglican faith as \"Thomas Brian\" in Loose on April 11, 1731. Martin and his siblings were raised amid humble surroundings in England. He had seven siblings, including four brothers and three sisters:\n\nMartin's uncle Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (known as Lord Fairfax) owned the Northern Neck Proprietary land grant, which he had inherited from Martin's great-grandfather Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper in 1719. The proprietary constituted up to of Virginia's Northern Neck and a vast area spanning west to the North Branch Potomac River headwaters. The Northern Neck Proprietary had been awarded by the exiled Charles II of England to seven of his supporters in 1649, and again in 1688 by official patent. One of these seven supporters, Lord Colepeper, acquired the right to the entire proprietary in 1681, and his grandson, Lord Fairfax, inherited the land grant upon the death of his mother, Katherine Colepeper. Lord Fairfax dispatched his first cousin William Fairfax (1691–1757) to replace Robert Carter I as the steward and land agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary, a position in which Fairfax served until his death in 1757. In 1750, Martin's uncle Lord Fairfax established himself at his hunting plantation Greenway Court estate near present-day White Post in Clarke County with the intention of administering the proprietary himself. Lord Fairfax had previously reserved this land as his private residence in 1747, then known as \"the Quarter\". With his cousin William Fairfax acting as land agent, Lord Fairfax sought additional assistance in managing the proprietary and scrutinized which of his family members from England would be up to the task. Lord Fairfax first considered his brother Robert, then his brother-in-law Denny Martin, and in 1751, he finally decided upon enlisting the assistance of his twenty-year-old nephew and Denny Martin's son, Thomas Bryan Martin.\n\nLord Fairfax sent for Martin, who arrived in Virginia from England aboard the \"Hatley\" on May 24, 1751, accompanied by William Fairfax, who had been seeking an appointment to a position in England. Martin and Fairfax arrived in Williamsburg, where they dined with Fairfax's fellow Virginia Governor's Council member John Blair, Sr., and visited the Governor's Palace and the Capitol before beginning their journey toward the Northern Neck on May 31. Following his arrival at the Northern Neck Proprietary, Martin settled at Greenway Court with his uncle that autumn. Due to his humble upbringing, Martin quickly adapted to frontier life at Greenway Court. He soon earned the affections of Lord Fairfax on account of his energetic nature, his loyalty, and his good eyesight, which greatly assisted his myopic uncle. On May 21, 1752, shortly after Martin had come of age on his twenty-first birthday, Lord Fairfax granted Greenway Court to his nephew, along with of limestone lands on the west bank of the Shenandoah River across from Leeds Manor, which were \"to be known and called by the name of the Manor of Greenway Court\" and subject to an annual quit-rent fee of \"a good buck and doe\" due on the feast day of Saint Michael the Archangel. Greenway Court had taken its name from the Culpeper family's manor in Kent.\n\nDesiring a larger role for himself in the proprietary's administration, Martin sought to influence his uncle into reorganizing the management of the proprietary. At Martin's suggestion, Lord Fairfax relocated the proprietary's base of operations northwest from Belvoir to an expressly built land office depository and archive at Greenway Court in 1762. Prior to this move, a small land office had been in operation at Greenway Court. Following William Fairfax's death in 1757, his son George William Fairfax (1729–1787) had succeeded him as steward and land agent of the proprietary. Martin succeeded Fairfax as the steward and land agent of the proprietary in 1762. Fairfax's replacement by Martin, the transfer of the land office and Martin's increased influence over Lord Fairfax caused bitter feelings from George William Fairfax, as evidenced by his letters during this period. Fairfax and his wife Sally Cary Fairfax returned to England in 1773 prior to the American Revolutionary War and did not return afterward.\n\nWhile residing at Greenway Court, Martin would have preferred more comfortable quarters than the rustic estate, as their living situation there was originally supposed to have been only temporary until the construction of a grander estate. In 1767, Martin wrote that plans for further construction and improvements at Greenway Court \"remain in status quo and in quo state they are likely to remain, ...we are building castles, tho' not on earth where one is greatly wanted, but castles in the air.\" Martin's uncle Robert Fairfax remarked on the primitive life at Greenway Court among \"strange, brutish people... past all conception\". For the next thirty years, until Lord Fairfax's death in 1781, Martin remained at Greenway Court and shared in the loneliness and solitude of his \"self-exiled\" uncle. While established at Greenway Court, Martin engaged in agricultural pursuits. In 1768, Martin described tobacco as the crop \"which is our all\". Like many other planters and farmers in the Shenandoah Valley, Martin had transitioned to the farming of wheat by 1792, at which time he wrote to his brother in England, \"Are you all starving that you give such prices for our flour; farming is now my object.\"\n\nIn addition to his management of the proprietary, Martin began taking an active role in political and civil affairs within his uncle's domain. Following an act of the Virginia General Assembly in February 1752, the Anglican Frederick Parish was authorized to hold an election for twelve parish vestrymen before June 15 of that year. Martin was elected as a vestryman, alongside his uncle Lord Fairfax and Gabriel Jones. Martin and his fellow vestrymen set about expanding and enlarging the Anglican presence within the parish.\n\nIn 1754, upon the creation of Hampshire County, Martin presided as the inaugural justice of the county's court. Under the act establishing the county, the first county court was to have been held in June 1754; however, the first court was not held until December 1757. The first court to be held was, in addition to Martin, composed of justices James Simpson, William Miller, Solomon Hedges, and Nathaniel Kuykendall with Gabriel Jones serving as the Clerk of Court. In 1755, Martin was further appointed as the County Lieutenant of Hampshire County. Martin was then elected alongside Thomas Walker to the House of Burgesses representing Hampshire County from 1768 to 1758. In 1758, Martin and George Washington challenged the incumbents and ran for election to represent Frederick County in the House of Burgesses against Hugh West and Thomas Swearingen. Martin and Washington received considerable support from Lord Fairfax, and the leading Anglican cleric in Frederick County, William Meldrum. Washington received the most votes with 310, followed by Martin with 240 votes, 199 votes for West, and 45 votes for Swearingen. Martin and Washington served alongside one another representing Frederick County until 1761. Martin chose not to run for reelection and retired from legislative politics in 1761.\n\nIn September 1758, the Virginia General Assembly appointed Martin as one of the trustees of Winchester. Martin was further appointed as a trustee of the town of Stephensburg (present-day Stephens City). His uncle Lord Fairfax, John Hite, Gabriel Jones, Robert Rutherford, Lewis Stephens, and James Wood were also appointed trustees of the towns alongside Martin. When the town of Bath (present-day Berkeley Springs) received its charter from the Virginia General Assembly in October 1776, Martin was appointed as a trustee alongside Bryan Fairfax, Philip Pendleton, Robert Rutherford, Samuel Washington, Warner Washington, Alexander White, and others.\n\nMartin was also appointed as the colonel of the Frederick County militia. While Martin was not in the best of health, he could be relied upon by the settlers of the proprietary to use his considerable resources to act promptly during an emergency, especially in response to attacks by Native Americans.\n\nBy the outbreak of the American Revolution, Martin was serving as an appointed justice on the Commission of Peace for Frederick County. Martin was reappointed as a justice of the peace by Governor Patrick Henry, along with William Booth and Warner Washington, but all three men declined to serve another term. Martin did not swear into the committee because he refused to serve under the new revolutionary regime, initially believing that American independence from Great Britain was a futile effort. The committee had also been actively arresting Loyalists, which may have influenced Martin's decision to turn down his reappointment. Martin retreated from performing civil service entirely, and afterward retired to Greenway Court. Prior to his death, Martin became an active Freemason.\n\nAs a Loyalist, Martin maintained a low profile following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. By 1778, the Virginia General Assembly had abolished quit-rents, but in recognition of Lord Fairfax's loyalty, the Northern Neck Proprietary was made an exception. Lord Fairfax was treated with respect and consideration by the assembly, and despite being the only resident peer in the American colonies, he was accorded all the privileges of a Virginia citizen. Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, his will was recorded on March 5, 1782, and conveyed his title to the remnants of his American properties, including the Northern Neck Proprietary, to Martin's elder brother Reverend Denny Martin, who then assumed the surname and coat of arms of Fairfax. Lord Fairfax devised his property and title to Denny Martin on the condition that he apply to the Parliament of Great Britain for an act to authorize him to inherit the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron. Martin was appointed by his uncle, along with Gabriel Jones and Peter Hog, as an executor of his will and estate. Martin inherited the plantation Lord Fairfax had purchased from John Borden consisting of . Martin was also bequeathed the Greenway Court estate and \"all the stock of cattle, sheep, hogs, implements of husbandry, household goods and furniture\" there. Martin and his brothers Denny and Philip also inherited all Lord Fairfax's slaves. Martin's uncle and Lord Fairfax's brother Robert Fairfax appealed his claim to the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron to Parliament, and succeeded as the 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.\n\nOn account of his residency in England, Denny Fairfax appointed Martin and Jones as managers of the proprietary. Martin and Jones placed advertisements in newspapers petitioning proprietary tenants to bring their claims against the Lord Fairfax estate forward and prove them. The descendants of William Fairfax continued to assert back claims against the estates of Lord Fairfax, which had been rendered by William Fairfax prior to 1757. In order to absolve himself of these back claims, Denny Fairfax renounced his appointments of Martin and Jones, and instead appointed Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron as the sole steward of the proprietary in an official transposition in London on September 21, 1784.\n\nBecause Denny Fairfax was a British subject residing in England, he had no legal rights under American jurisdiction; thus, he and his British relatives were considered \"alien enemies\" and his landholdings were confiscated under escheat laws. In 1785, the Virginia General Assembly ordered that all records, books, and documents pertaining to the proprietary's lands be confiscated by the state of Virginia and removed to the Virginia State Land Registrar's Office in Richmond. Virginia seized the remaining proprietary lands that had not yet been granted, and citizens that had already acquired grants from the proprietary were permitted to keep their land. Land values in the Northern Neck continued to increase in value, which Martin noted in a 1790 letter. The higher land prices caused many residents of the proprietary to sell their lands and relocate further into the frontier, which Martin commented: \"The emigration of inhabitants is... astonishing.\"\n\nFollowing the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Martin took his uncle's housekeeper Mrs. Crawford as his mistress, and fathered a daughter by her. Mrs. Crawford remained Martin's mistress for several years until her death. Their daughter married British captain Francis Geldart; however, she died without issue soon after their marriage, and Martin gave Geldart of Greenway Court and a number of slaves. Following the death of his daughter, Martin employed housekeeper Betsy Powers at Greenway Court. Martin died unmarried in 1798, and his will dated July 24, 1794, was proved on October 1, 1798. In it, he bequeathed his Greenway Court estate and an adjoining to his housekeeper Betsy Powers. Powers also inherited \"all houses thereon, household goods (except plate and watch), one half of stock of horses, cattle, sheep and hogs and choice of ten slaves\". Martin's living sisters Frances, Sybilla, and Anna Susanna Martin received \"all moneys, and remainder of personal property\" not bequeathed to Powers. Each of the executors of Martin's will received ten guineas. Martin bequeathed the remainder of his property and the of Greenway Court, should Powers have predeceased him, to his will executors Gabriel Jones, Robert Mackey, and John Sherman Woodcock to divide into parcels and sell, the profits from which were to be given to Martin's sisters. Powers also received a chariot, harness, and in Stafford County near Falmouth. Following Martin's death, Powers married W. Carnagy.\n\nDue to his advanced age and his inability to relocate to America, Martin's brother Denny Fairfax was unable to properly protect and maintain his American possessions and conveyed by deed on August 30, 1797, to James Markham Marshall \"all and every of those divers tracts, pieces and parcels of land, being part and parcel of the proprietary of the Northern Neck of Va., with all beneficial right and interest of whatsoever nature the same may be\". This conveyance thus terminated the Fairfax and Martin families' interest in the proprietary. In 1799, the Virginia General Assembly authorized Marshall as the legal titleholder of Fairfax's remaining landholdings. The Northern Neck Proprietary was officially dissolved in 1806 when Virginia again became its legal owner.\n\nThe legality of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands continued to be contested in state and federal courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in \"Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee\", 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in \"Martin v. Hunter's Lessee\", 14 U.S. 304. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in \"Martin v. Hunter's Lessee\" as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.\n\nProprietor Adam Stephen, a close personal friend of Martin, had the town of Martinsburg in Berkeley County formally established by the Virginia General Assembly in 1778. Stephen named the town in honor of his friend Martin.\n\n"}
{"id": "39095498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39095498", "title": "Vaillancourt Fountain", "text": "Vaillancourt Fountain\n\nVaillancourt Fountain, sometimes called Quebec libre!, is a large fountain in Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco, designed by the Québécois artist Armand Vaillancourt in 1971. It is about high and is constructed out of precast concrete square tubes. Long considered controversial because of its stark, modernist appearance, there have been several unsuccessful proposals to demolish the fountain over the years. It was the site of a free concert by U2 in 1987, when lead singer Bono spray painted graffiti on the fountain and was both praised and criticized for the action.\n\nThe fountain is in a highly visible spot on the downtown San Francisco waterfront, in Justin Herman Plaza, where Market Street meets The Embarcadero. The Hyatt Regency Hotel is at the edge of the plaza, adjacent to the other four highrise towers of the Embarcadero Center. Across The Embarcadero is the Ferry Building, and the eastern end of the California Street cable car line is on the other side of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.\nWhen Vaillancourt designed the fountain, the elevated Embarcadero Freeway or Interstate 480, was still in existence along the Embarcadero. The fountain was designed with the freeway environment in mind, but it was built to bring people to an expansive public space, as \"San Francisco Chronicle\" architecture critic John King calls it \"an act of defiant distraction until the freeway came down in 1991\".\n\n\"Vaillancourt Fountain\" was a product of the redevelopment of San Francisco that took place in the 1950s and 1960s. The Transamerica Pyramid was constructed from 1969-1972 and BART was also being constructed, the Embarcadero Station would eventually open in 1976.\n\nJustin Herman, for whom the plaza was named, was a leading figure in this process and the executive director of the redevelopment agency in charge. Modernist landscape architect Lawrence Halprin was selected for the redesign of Market Street from the Embarcadero to the Civic Center, the most visible two mile thoroughfare in San Francisco. Halprin had designed other spaces in the city such as Ghirardelli Square and the United Nations Plaza. He designed Justin Herman Plaza, but hired Armand Vaillancourt to design the fountain. Vaillancourt, 38 years old at the time, had won the invitational fountain design competition that Halprin had judged. Halprin was quoted as saying that if the fountain didn't prove to be among the \"great works of civic art ... I am going to slit my throat\".\n\nThe fountain is about high, weighs approximately , and is constructed out of precast concrete square tubes. The fountain is positioned in a pool shaped like an irregular pentagon, and is designed to pump up to of water per minute.\n\nThe fountain looks unfinished, like concrete that has not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza \"like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.\" There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water. The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US $310,000. It was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that its cost was US $607,800.\n\nJust before the dedication, the slogan \"Quebec Libre\" (a reference to the Quebec sovereignty movement) was painted on the fountain at night, and the graffiti was erased. During the dedication, attended by Thomas Hoving, director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, a rock band played, and Armand Vaillancourt himself painted \"Quebec Libre\" on the fountain in as many places as he could reach. A redevelopment agency employee started to paint over the slogans during the ceremony, but Herman stopped him, saying it could be done later. When asked about why he defaced his own fountain with graffiti he responded, \"No, no. It's a joy to make a free statement. This fountain is dedicated to all freedom. Free Quebec! Free East Pakistan! Free Viet Nam! Free the whole world!\" Vaillancourt said his actions were \"a powerful performance\" intended to illustrate the notion of power to the people. \"Quebec Libre\" has been an alternate name for the fountain since.\n\nOn the first leg of The Joshua Tree Tour by the rock band U2 in 1987, they performed concerts at the Cow Palace just south of San Francisco on April 24 and April 25, 1987. On the third leg of the tour, concerts had been announced for November 14 and 15, 1987, across the San Francisco Bay, at the Oakland Coliseum.\n\nOn the morning of November 11, 1987, local radio stations announced that U2 would hold a free-admission concert that day in Justin Herman Plaza, with the stage set up in front of the Vaillancourt Fountain. Within a few hours, a crowd estimated at 20,000 people gathered in the plaza. The concert was jokingly called \"Save the Yuppies\", in reference to the 1987 stock market crash that had taken place three weeks earlier.\n\nThe band closed their nine-song performance with their hit \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\". During the instrumental portion in the middle of the song, Bono, lead singer of the band, climbed onto the sculpture and spray painted graffiti on it, reading \"Rock N Roll Stops The Traffic\". Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who had been waging a citywide campaign against graffiti that had resulted in over 300 citations during the year, was angry and criticized Bono for defacing a San Francisco landmark. She said, \"I am disappointed that a rock star who is supposed to be a role model for young people chose to vandalize the work of another artist. The unfortunate incident marred an otherwise wonderful rock concert.\" Bono was issued a citation for misdemeanor malicious mischief. U2 manager Paul McGuinness said, \"This is clearly not an act of vandalism. This act was clearly in the spirit of the artwork itself.\" The numerous callers to Ronn Owens' radio talk show on KGO-AM were evenly split, with younger listeners defending the singer's action and older ones not. Bono soon apologized, saying \"I really do regret it. It was dumb.\" The singer explained that he thought that he was honoring the artist's work and that the artist had agreed, but later Bono realized that the city owned the fountain. The group covered the cost of removal of the graffiti.\n\nArmand Vaillancourt flew from Quebec to California after the incident, and spoke in favor of Bono's actions at U2's Oakland performance several days later. Vaillancourt said, \"Good for him. I want to shake his hand. People get excited about such a little thing.\" The sculptor spray-painted a slogan of his own on the band's stage, \"Stop the Madness\".\n\nThe episode received further attention when it was featured in U2's 1988 documentary film \"Rattle and Hum\". There, footage of it was shown over, and interspersed with, the band's opening number, \"All Along the Watchtower\", a song by Bob Dylan that had been a big hit for Jimi Hendrix. This has led some people to misidentify the song being played when the spray painting occurred. In any case, the fountain and plaza ended up on one U2 fan site's list of recommended group-related places in the U.S. to visit.\n\nFollowing the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the elevated Embarcadero Freeway was so badly damaged that it was torn down, and was replaced by a boulevard at ground level. An architect hired by the city also proposed demolition of the fountain, but no decision was made. \n\nIn 2004, San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin renewed the call to demolish the fountain. The water supply to the fountain had been turned off for several years, because of California's energy crisis of those years. Armand Vaillancourt immediately pledged that he would \"fight like a devil to preserve that work\". Debra Lahane, a member of the San Francisco Arts Commission, said that \"it succeeds as a work of art if it provokes dialogue and discussion. Art that engages the public has had a measure of success.\" Within a few months, the water was flowing again, and plans to tear down the fountain were abandoned.\n\nAt the fountain's opening in 1971, both the water flow and human participation were considered integral to the work. Alfred Frankenstein, writing for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", noted \"the heart of the idea is the unique one of public entry into and intimate exploration of the fountain’s innards; in this it is unique and decidedly a success. It is not a great work of sculpture, which is like observing that an automobile is not much of a success as a horse.\"\n\nThe water was turned off at the fountain from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated the cost of electricity was approximately US $200,000 per year to operate the fountain. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city would pay for the operating costs (at a revised estimate of US $76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US $20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again during the winter of 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.\n\nIn reaction to the 2011–17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was turned off in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason it had not been reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow again was approximately US $500,000.\n\nCharles Desmarais, the current art critic of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" echoed Frankenstein's comments from 1971, calling for the water to return in an August 2017 opinion article:\nOn August 15, 2017, water was restored to the fountain as a test run, with the intention that it will stay on until November, when the ice rink reopens. The water has been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The nontoxic aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of light into the water, and tints the water blue.\n\nThe fountain has been considered controversial since its construction, and criticism of it has continued over the years. Hoving, in his dedication speech, said of the fountain had some of the daring of Baroque sculpture and that \"A work of art must be born in controversy.\" Herman himself said it was \"one of the greatest artistic achievements in North America.\"\nAt the time of its dedication, the San Francisco chapter of the National Safety Council said that the fountain \"may be a safety hazard\". Opponents of the work handed out leaflets at the dedication of the fountain describing it as a \"loathsome monstrosity\", a \"howling obscenity\", an \"obscene practical joke\", \"idiotic rubble\", and a \"pestiferous eyesore\". Art critic Alfred Frankenstein of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" responded that \"its very outrageousness and extravagance are part of its challenge\" and therefore, it \"can't be all bad.\" He added that the fountain was intended to be participated in rather than just observed. \nAn early comment by architecture critic Allan Temko, often repeated over the years, describes \"technological excrescences\" that had been \"deposited by a giant concrete dog with square intestines\". Another pithy remark that gained press attention, from critic Lloyd Skinner, was that the fountain was \"Stonehenge, unhinged, with plumbing troubles\".\n\nArtists have been critical of the work as well. Sculptor Benny Bufano called it \"a jumble of nothing\", artist Willard Cox likened it to \"dynamited debris\", and sculptor Humphrey Diaquist said it had been created by \"a figure of deranged talent\". Ruth Asawa noted in 1989 that \"In the attempt to provide a disguise and diversion from the freeway, the goal of the fountain as a work of art was lost.\"\n\nThe fountain has been called the \"least revered modernist work of art\" in San Francisco. Due to its size, it has been said that it \"dominates the landscape\" of the north side of Justin Herman Plaza. It has also been said that the design intent was \"to mock and mirror the clumsy, double-decked roadway\", referring to the elevated Embarcadero Freeway which separated the fountain from the waterfront at the time of construction. \n\nCharles Birnbaum, noted Halprin expert, stated the architect \"always wanted people to interact with his water features\" and that Justin Herman Plaza \"was intended as a total environment, a space animated by people as well as water\", so the fountain was designed to attract the public to an area otherwise cut off from the waterfront by the Embarcadero Freeway.\n\n\n"}
