Completed in 1938, the building is part of Rockefeller Center, which was built in the Art Deco style. \n\nRockefeller Center occupies three blocks in Midtown Manhattan bounded by Fifth and Sixth Avenues to the east and west, between 48th Street to the south and 51st Street to the north. By 1936, most of the complex had been completed. Rockefeller Center Inc. only needed to develop three empty plots in the middle of the complex's northern and southern blocks.\n\nRockefeller Center's executives went into talks with the Associated Press for a building on the northern empty lot, which was occupied by the complex's truck delivery ramp. The lot had been reserved for the Metropolitan Opera house, but the managers could not wait to develop the lot anymore, so in 1937, the opera plans were formally scrapped. The lot had also been planned as a hotel site, but this was also deemed economically infeasible. In January 1938, Associated Press agreed to rent the fourth through seventh floors of the structure, with the building to be named for the company.\n\nConstruction of the steelwork started in April 1938, and after 29 working days, it was topped out by June. The Associated Press moved into the structure in December. The building, located at 50 Rockefeller Plaza, was built to the outer limits of its lot without any setbacks or rooftop gardens; it rose only 15 floors because of the 1916 zoning law and the paucity of other tenants. The presence of Associated Press and Time Inc. expanded Rockefeller Center's scope from strictly a radio-communications complex to a hub of both radio and print media. In 1938, the Associated Press opened the Guild, a newsreel theater, along the curve of the truck ramp below the building.\n\n50 Rockefeller Plaza is located on the west side of Rockefeller Plaza between 50th and 51st Streets. The only building in the Center built to the outer limits of its lot line, the 15-story building took its shape from Associated Press's need for a single, undivided, loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate—namely, a blocky structure with no setbacks. At one point, of transmission wire were embedded in conduits on the building's fourth floor. The complex's truck ramp descends under the building from 50th Street, while the rear of the building is located next to the Radio City Music Hall. The building also contained the Guild Theater, a 450-seat newsreel theater, from 1938 to 1999.\n\nIsamu Noguchi's stainless steel panel, \"News\", is located above the building's entrance. His work, which depicts the various forms of communications used by journalists in the 1930s, honors the different occupations in the news industry. It is one of Noguchi's last abstract works as well as the only stainless steel work he ever commissioned.\n\n"}

Rising 619 feet (189 m), the 43-story tower is the tallest office building in Michigan and the second tallest building overall in the state behind the central hotel tower of the Renaissance Center, located a few blocks away. Although the Penobscot Building has more floors above ground (45), those of Ally Detroit Center are taller, with its roof sitting roughly taller than that of the Penobscot. Its floor area is .\n\nThe building was designed by noted architects John Burgee & Philip Johnson, partners influential in postmodern architecture. Ally Detroit Center was constructed from 1991 to 1993. It houses numerous tenants, including many prominent Detroit law firms and PricewaterhouseCoopers. In addition to retail, the building also contains a restaurant and a gym.\n\nThe building is famous for its postmodern architectural design topped with Flemish-inspired neo-gothic spires which blend architecturally with the city's historic skyline. It is constructed mainly of granite. Sometimes called a \"twin gothic structure\", for its pairs of spires, it is oriented North-South and East-West (as named on a plaque along the Windsor waterfront park). Ally Detroit Center won an Award of Excellence for its design in 1996. Ally Detroit Center replicas have become a souvenir item along with those of other Detroit skyscrapers.\n\nProject plans for a twin tower directly to the east, Two Detroit Center, were placed indefinitely on hold. Two Detroit Center parking garage was constructed on the site in 2002.\n\nThe law firm Dickinson Wright (formerly Dickinson, Wright, Moon, Van Dusen & Freeman) has its headquarters in Ally Detroit Center. The company moved into the building when it opened in 1992. In 2007 the company had almost of space in the building. That year it renewed its lease. Additionally, the law firm of Clark Hill, PLC rents three floors in the building.\n\nThe building has been occupied by Comerica Bank. In efforts to expand its U.S. presence, the bank has engaged in a succession of takeovers in Texas, Florida, Arizona, and California. The bank's lease on Comerica Tower at Detroit Center ran through 2012. Comerica is a major sponsor of Comerica Park, the home of the Detroit Tigers baseball team. In December 2009, tenant Comerica announced it would vacate Ally Detroit Center by 2012, consolidating its Michigan operations at 411 West Lafayette Boulevard.\n\nIn March 2015, following the purchase of the building by Dan Gilbert, and Bedrock Real Estate Services, it was announced that Ally Financial will move its main office into the building from the nearby Renaissance Center as well as move all employees in suburban Detroit to the building, occupying 13 floors. The tower was renamed Ally Detroit Center.\n\n\n"}

Aimed at global financial professionals, \"Bloomberg Markets\" publishes articles on the people and issues related to global financial markets. \"Bloomberg Markets\", which is based in New York City, has readers in 147 countries. More than half of its readers live outside the U.S.\n\nAs of December 2011, the magazine had a circulation of 375,000 and was available for sale at bookstores and selected newsstands. All subscribers of the Bloomberg Professional service and the Bloomberg Terminal also receive \"Bloomberg Markets\" as part of their subscription. Newsstand sales averaged 6,154 in 2010.\n\n\"Bloomberg Markets\" was launched in July 1992 as \"Bloomberg: A Magazine for Bloomberg Users\" and was originally intended to be a guide for the Bloomberg Professional service. Although every issue included instructions for navigating terminal functions, content also included articles about financial markets aimed at portfolio managers, corporate executives, brokers, bankers and securities traders. William Inman served as \"Bloomberg Markets\" founding editor.\n\nIn 1999, the magazine became part of Bloomberg News and Ronald Henkoff became editor. Prior to joining \"Bloomberg Markets\", Henkoff worked as a reporter and editor at \"Newsweek\" and \"Fortune\". Henkoff was tapped by Bloomberg News chief Matt Winkler to bolster the magazine's feature writing, which had not been a focus of the publication. In 2000, the magazine's name was changed to \"Bloomberg Markets\" and became available on newsstands.\n\nIn fall 2010, \"Bloomberg Markets\" was redesigned in an effort to attract a broader array of advertisers and expand its content. The redesign, led by \"Bloomberg Markets\" editor Ronald Henkoff and publisher Michael Dukmejian and developed by the firm of Priest + Grace, gave the publication a new, more contemporary look. In April 2011, \"Bloomberg Markets\" hired its first creative director, Siung Tjia, the former creative director of ESPN The Magazine. In addition to design changes, the editors added regular coverage of careers and personal finance following a global survey of readers.\n\nIn addition to the redesign, \"Bloomberg Markets\" unveiled a trade advertising campaign to position itself as the leading publication for the \"global financial elite\" and increased its circulation rate base from 355,000 to 375,000 by December 2011. The campaign and shift in design lead to new advertising deals with luxury brands such as Range Rover, Goldman Sachs and Allianz. The ultimate goal, according to Dukmejian, is for \"Bloomberg Markets\" to reach a circulation of 450,000 with 15,000 on newsstands.\n\nIn June 2011, \"Bloomberg Markets\" announced the launch of the 50 Most Influential franchise, its list of the most influential people in global finance, which appeared in the October 2011 issue. To coincide with the issue, the magazine hosted the inaugural Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit, a day-long event, held in September 2011 in New York City. A second 50 Most Influential ranking was published in the magazine's October 2012 issue.\n\n\"Bloomberg Markets\" would be testing a spin-off luxury title with a spring 2012 issue called \"Bloomberg Pursuits\".\n\nIn October 2015 it was announced by the parent company that \"Bloomberg Markets\" would reduce publication from 11 issues a year to six.\n\n\"Bloomberg Markets\" has a staff of editors in the U.S., Latin America, Europe and Asia. In addition, the magazine draws on contributions from journalists at Bloomberg News, a global news service with 146 bureaus in 72 countries.\n\n\"Bloomberg Markets\" has won almost 200 journalism and design awards including a Gerald Loeb Award, a Scripps Howard Award and a George Polk Award. In 1995, the magazine was a finalist for the National Magazine Awards in the General Excellence category for magazines with a circulation under 100,000.\n\nIn 2006, editor Ron Henkoff won the Lawrence Minard Award as part of the Gerald Loeb Awards, which recognizes an editor whose career achievements and contributions to the profession of business, financial and economic journalism exemplify excellence in the area of editing.\n\nIn 2011, \"Bloomberg Markets\" was named a finalist for the American Society of Magazine Editors' General Excellence Award for Finance, Technology and Lifestyle Magazines and \"Bloomberg Markets\" senior writer David Evans was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist in the National Reporting category. Evans also received the 2011 John Chancellor Award given by Columbia Journalism School.\n\nIn 2012, \"Bloomberg Markets\" was made available in digital form for the iPad alongside its Businessweek subscription circulation.\n\n\"Duping The Families of Fallen Soldiers\" (September 2010)\n\nFollowing a six-month investigation, David Evans's article revealed that life insurance companies were withholding billions of dollars in benefits from the families of slain soldiers and millions of other Americans. As a result of the article, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs required that Prudential offer the families of slain soldiers the option of receiving one check for the full amount of the death benefit. Evans was named as a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for his article.\n\n\"Toxic Debt\" (July 2007)\n\nThis three-story cover package revealed the complicit role of rating companies Moody's and Standard and Poor's in creating the complex mortgage-backed securities stuffed with subprime debt that would trigger the global credit crisis.\n\n\"Big Pharma's Shameful Secret\" (December 2005)\n\nThe article revealed that poorly supervised clinical trials for potential new drugs often injure and kill participants. As a result of the magazine's expose, the largest clinical trial company in the U.S. ousted its three top managers and government authorities shut down its biggest test center.\n\n\"The Banks That Fleeced Alabama\" (September 2005)\n\n\"Bloomberg Markets\" magazine reported that a group of banks led by JPMorgan Chase had overcharged Jefferson County, home to Birmingham, by at least $60 million in fees assessed on $5.8 billion in complex contracts called Interest-rate swaps that the county used to finance a sewer system. In October 2009, former Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford was convicted of taking bribes to steer a share of the JPMorgan deals to a local bank.

{"id": "3452243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3452243", "title": "Chairman", "text": "Chairman\n\nThe chairman (also chair) is the highest officer of an organized group such as a board, a committee, or a deliberative assembly. The person holding the office is typically elected or appointed by the members of the group, and the chairman presides over meetings of the assembled group and conducts its business in an orderly fashion. \n\nIn some organizations, the chairman position is also called \"president\" (or other title), in others, where a board appoints a president (or other title), the two different terms are used for distinctly different positions.\n\nOther terms sometimes used for the office and its holder include \"chair\", \"chairperson\", \"chairwoman\", \"presiding officer\", \"president\", \"moderator\", \"facilitator\", and \"convenor\". The chairman of a parliamentary chamber is often called the \"speaker\".\n\nThe term \"chair\" is sometimes used in lieu of chairman, in response to criticisms that using chairman is sexist. It is commonly used today, and has been used as a substitute for chairman since the middle of the 17th century, with its earliest citation in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" dated 1658–1659, only four years after the first citation for chairman.Major dictionaries state that the word derives from \"chair\" (a seat or office of authority) and \"man\", a person.\n\nA 1994 Canadian study found the \"Toronto Star\" newspaper referring to most presiding men as \"chairman\", and to most presiding women as \"chairperson\" or as \"chairwoman\". The \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" uses \"chairman\" for men and \"chairperson\" for women. An analysis of the British National Corpus found chairman used 1,142 times, chairperson 130 times and chairwoman 68 times. The National Association of Parliamentarians does not approve using \"chairperson\". \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The New York Times\" and United Press International all use \"chairwoman\" or \"chairman\" when referring to women, and forbid use of \"chair\" or of \"chairperson\" except in direct quotations. \n\nIn World Schools Style debating, male chairs are called \"Mr. Chairman\" and female chairs are called \"Madame Chair\". The FranklinCovey Style Guide for Business and Technical Communication, as well as the American Psychological Association style guide, advocate using \"chair\" or \"chairperson\", rather than \"chairman\". The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style suggests that the gender-neutral forms are gaining ground. It advocates using \"chair\" to refer both to men and to women.\n\nThe word \"chair\" can refer to the place from which the holder of the office presides, whether on a chair, at a lectern, or elsewhere. During meetings, the person presiding is said to be \"in the chair\" and is also referred to as \"the chair\". Parliamentary procedure requires that members address the \"chair\" as \"Mr. (or Madam) Chairman (or Chair or Chairperson)\" rather than using a name – one of many customs intended to maintain the presiding officer's impartiality and to ensure an objective and impersonal approach.\n\nIn the United States, the presiding officer of the lower house of a legislative body, such as the House of Representatives, is frequently titled the \"Speaker\", while the upper house, such as the Senate, is commonly chaired by a \"President\". In his 1992 State of the Union address, then-U.S. President George H. W. Bush used \"chairman\" for men and \"chair\" for women.\n\nIn the British music hall tradition, the Chairman was the master of ceremonies who announced the performances and was responsible for controlling any rowdy elements in the audience. The role was popularised on British TV in the 1960s and 1970s by Leonard Sachs, the Chairman on the variety show \"The Good Old Days\".\n\n\"Chairman\" as a quasi-title gained particular resonance when socialist states from 1917 onward shunned more traditional leadership labels and stressed the collective control of \"soviets\" (councils or committees) by beginning to refer to executive figureheads as \"Chairman of the X Committee\". Vladimir Lenin, for example, officially functioned as the head of Soviet Russia not as tsar or as president but in roles such as \"Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR\".\nNote in particular the popular standard method for referring to Mao Zedong: \"Chairman Mao\" (officially: Chairman of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission).\n\nIn addition to the administrative or executive duties in organizations, the chairman has the duties of presiding over meetings. Such duties at meetings include:\n\n\nWhile presiding, the chairman should remain impartial and not interrupt a speaker if the speaker has the floor and is following the rules of the group. In committees or small boards, the chairman votes along with the other members. However, in assemblies or larger boards, the chairman should vote only when it can affect the result. At a meeting, the chairman only has one vote (i.e. the chairman cannot vote twice and cannot override the decision of the group unless the organization has specifically given the chairman such authority).\n\nThe powers of the chairman vary widely across organizations. In some organizations the chairman has the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions, while in others the chairman only makes recommendations to a board of directors, and still others the chairman has no executive powers and is mainly a spokesman for the organization. The amount of power given to the chairman depends on the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.\n\nIf the chairman exceeds the given authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform the duties, the chairman may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include censure, suspension, or removal from office. The rules of the particular organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures and the extent that they can be done. Usually, whoever appointed or elected the chairman has the power to discipline this officer.\n\nThere are three common types of chairman in public corporations.\n\n\n\n\nThe non-executive chairman's duties are typically limited to matters directly related to the board, such as:\n\n\nMany U.S. companies have an executive chairman, and this method of organization is sometimes called the American model. Having a non-executive chair is common in the United Kingdom and Canada, and is sometimes called the British model. Expert opinion is rather evenly divided over which is the preferable model overall.\n\nCompanies with both an executive chairman and a CEO include Ford, HSBC, Google, HP, and Apple.\n\nA \"vice-chairman\" or \"deputy chairman\", subordinate to the chairman, is sometimes chosen to assist the chairman and to serve as chairman in the absence of the chairman, or when a motion involving the chairman is being discussed. In the absence of the chairman and vice chairman, groups sometimes elect a \"chairman pro tempore\" to fill the role for a single meeting. In some organizations that have both titles, deputy chairman ranks higher than vice chairman, as there are often multiple vice chairs but only a single deputy chair. This type of deputy chairman title on its own usually has only an advisory role and not an operational one (such as Ted Turner at Time Warner).\n\nAn unrelated definition of vice chair and deputy chair describes an executive who is higher ranking or has more seniority than an executive vice president (EVP). Sometimes, EVPs report to a vice chair, who in turn reports directly to the chief executive officer (CEO) (so vice chairs in effect constitute an additional layer of management), while other vice chairs have more responsibilities but are otherwise on an equal tier with EVPs. Executives with the title vice chair and deputy chair are usually \"not\" members of the board of directors. The Royal Bank of Canada previously used \"deputy chair\" (i.e. Anthony S. Fell, Deputy Chairman of RBC, who was also Chairman and CEO of RBC Dominion Securities) and \"vice chair\" (i.e. Peter Currie, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer) in their inner management circle until 2004.\n\n"}

{"id": "13245601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13245601", "title": "Competition law theory", "text": "Competition law theory\n\nCompetition law theory covers the strands of thought relating to competition law or antitrust policy.\n\nThe classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the individual liberty of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods. Restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances. Hence the courts found specific categories of agreement, specific clauses, to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness, and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power. Earlier theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis.\n\n\"A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by keeping the market constantly under-stocked, by never fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate.\"\n\nIn \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776) Adam Smith also pointed out the cartel problem, but did not advocate legal measures to combat them.\n\n\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary.\"\n\nSmith also rejected the very existence of, not just dominant and abusive corporations, but corporations at all.\n\nBy the latter half of the nineteenth century it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy. John Stuart Mill's approach was laid down in his treatise \"On Liberty\" (1859).\n\n\"Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society... both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, qua restraint, is an evil...\"\n\nThe use of the word \"society\" to mean the state, and the false claim that because a \"social act\" effects the \"interest\" of other persons it comes under the \"jurisdiction\" of the state, even if the act is entirely voluntary (i.e. an act of Free Will, agency, for both parties in the exchange). Liberty in commercial matters (in the voluntary buying and selling of goods and services) is not some different \"principle\" to liberty generally - it is clearly the same principle.\n\nAfter Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasised a more precise and theoretical model of competition. A simple neo-classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes social welfare. This model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms, or to use legal language, there are no barriers to entry. By this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver allocative, productive and dynamic efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also known as Pareto efficiency after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto and means that resources in an economy over the long run will go precisely to those who are willing and able to pay for them. Because rational producers will keep producing and selling, and buyers will keep buying up to the last marginal unit of possible output - or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced - there is no waste, the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and utility is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off; society has achieved allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can. Free markets are meant to reward those who work hard, and therefore those who will put society's resources towards the frontier of its possible production. Dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research, create and innovate to keep its share of consumers. This traces to Austrian-American political scientist Joseph Schumpeter's notion that a \"perennial gale of creative destruction\" is ever sweeping through capitalist economies, driving enterprise at the market's mercy.\n\nContrasting with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When only one or a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices raise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing social welfare by creating a deadweight loss. Sources of this market power are said to include the existence of externalities, barriers to entry of the market, and the free rider problem. Markets may fail to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law's intervention to the rule of \"laissez faire\" is justified. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that perfect competition is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called \"workable\" or \"effective competition\". This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best option by using the law to tame market operation where it can.\n\nA group of economists and lawyers, who are largely associated with the University of Chicago, advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition. The US Supreme Court has used the Chicago School approach in several recent cases. One view of the Chicago School approach to antitrust is found in United States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner's books\"Antitrust law\" and \"Economic Analysis of Law\" Posner once worked in the Department of Justice's antitrust division, has long been a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and is likely the most widely cited antitrust scholar and jurist in the United States.\n\nRobert Bork was highly critical of court decisions on United States antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book \"The Antitrust Paradox\". Bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was pursuit \"only\" of consumer welfare, the protection of competition rather than competitors. Furthermore, only a few acts should be prohibited, namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets, mergers that create monopolies, and dominant firms pricing predatorily, while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and price discrimination on the grounds that it did not harm consumers. Running through the different critiques of US antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good. \"The only cure for bad theory\", writes Bork, \"is better theory\". The late Harvard Law School Professor Phillip Areeda, who favours more aggressive antitrust policy, in at least one Supreme Court case challenged Robert Bork's preference for non intervention.\n\nSome economic libertarians have criticised competition law in its entirety,\nchallenging the legitimacy of action against price fixing and cartels.\n\nSee Dominic Armentaro \"Antitrust: The Case for Repeal\" (Ludwig Von Mises Institute 1986) and \"The Case Against Antitrust\" by Robert A. Levy (Cato Institute 2004). The case being that \"competition law\" (or \"Antitrust\") is based upon a false view of economics - that it harms rather than benefits consumers in the long term. And that \"competition law\" (or \"Antitrust\") is based upon principles of law and philosophy that are both false and confused.\n\nAnti-cartel enforcement is a key focus of competition law enforcement policy. In the United States the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act 2004 raised the maximum imprisonment term for price fixing from three to ten years, and the maximum fine from $10 million to $100 million. In 2007 British Airways and Korean Air pleaded guilty to fixing cargo and passenger flight prices.\n\nThese actions complement the private enforcement which has always been an important feature of United States antitrust law. The United States Supreme Court summarised why Congress allows punitive damages in \"Hawaii v. Standard Oil\".\n\n\"Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation.\"\n\nIn the EU, the Modernisation Regulation 1/2003 means that the European Commission is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of European Community competition law. This was done in order to facilitate quicker resolution of competition-related inquiries. In 2005 the Commission issued a Green Paper on \"Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules\", which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier.\n\n\n\n"}

It is where a large number of the city's highrise buildings are located, as well as being the center of government and business for the region.\n\nDowntown is roughly defined as the area between Marble Avenue, Coal Avenue, Sixth Street, and the New Mexico Rail Runner Express railroad tracks. The area on the east side of the railroad tracks is known as East Downtown or EDo.\n\nDowntown Albuquerque is laid out in a standard grid pattern, with numbered north-south \"streets\" and named east-west \"avenues\". Central Avenue (originally known as Railroad Avenue) is the main east-west thoroughfare through the center of Downtown, while Lomas Boulevard (originally New York Avenue) is a major east-west arterial through the north part of downtown.\n\nThe streets start with First Street just west of the railroad tracks and increase in number moving westward. Fourth Street was originally the main north-south thoroughfare through Downtown but today it is discontinuous, interrupted by Civic Plaza. The two block stretch between Central and Civic Plaza was once converted into a pedestrian mall, but was reverted to a vehicular roadway in late 2014. Since these developments took place Second Street has been the main north-south street through downtown.\n\nFourth Street through downtown Albuquerque was part of U.S. Route 66 prior to the route's 1937 realignment. Afterwards, Route 66 ran along Central Avenue until its decommissioning.\n\nDowntown Albuquerque is divided into six official districts, which are identified by a unified system of signage and icons.\n\nLocated on the north side of downtown, this district is bounded by Marble Avenue, Roma Avenue, Second Street, and Seventh Street. It is named for the three major courthouses located at the intersection of Fourth and Lomas: Pete V. Domenici United States Courthouse, Bernalillo County Courthouse, and the Bernalillo County Metropolitan Courthouse.\n\nOn the north side of downtown along the railroad tracks, the Warehouse District includes the area between Second and the railroad tracks, north of the Convention Center to Slate Avenue. As its name implies, this area contains mostly warehouses from the railroad era.\n\nThe Plaza District is the central area of downtown, bounded by Roma, Copper, Seventh, and the railroad tracks. It is centered on Civic Plaza and includes many of Albuquerque's large office and government buildings including the Albuquerque City-County Building, the Convention Center, Albuquerque Plaza, the Compass Bank Building, and the Albuquerque Petroleum Building. The Main Library of the Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System is also located in this district.\n\nThis district is centered along Central Avenue and Gold Avenue east of First Street. It contains most of downtown Albuquerque's historic buildings as well as most of its shopping, dining, and nightlife destinations. Notable landmarks in this district include the KiMo Theater, Occidental Life Building, First National Bank Building, and Sunshine Building. There is a small concentration of government and office buildings on Gold Avenue which includes the Dennis Chavez Federal Building, Gold Building, and Simms Building. Amy Biehl High School is also located in this district.\n\nThis is the smallest district, encompassing the area south of Central Avenue and east of First Street. Most of the district is occupied by Alvarado Transportation Center.\n\nThe southernmost part of downtown, the Casa District includes the area between Gold and Coal Avenue, extending all the way west to Tenth Street. This is a primarily residential district, with a large number of loft apartment buildings. Alvarado Square, the location of the PNM Building and the headquarters of Bernalillo County, is also located in the Casa District.\n\nNot one of the official downtown districts, EDo (East Downtown) is a small but expanding neighborhood centered on Central and Broadway on the east side of the railroad tracks, bounded roughly by the railroad tracks on the west, I-25 on the east, Coal on the south, and Martin Luther King Avenue on the north. EDo is a trendy area containing several loft apartment buildings and a number of small shops and restaurants. The focal point of EDo is the renovated Old Albuquerque High School campus, which is now a residential complex. The name \"EDo\" was coined in imitation of the LoDo area of Denver which in turn was an imitation of SoHo and TriBeCa in New York City .\n\nDowntown Albuquerque contains most of the city's highrise buildings, including the four tallest. The tallest downtown buildings are listed below:\n\nThere are a number of buildings in downtown that are on the National Register of Historic Places:\n\nDowntown is the center of public transit in the city, and is served by a network of ABQ RIDE routes including local routes, the Albuquerque Rapid Transit BRT route, and the Rapid Ride express routes, most of which include stops at the Alvarado Transportation Center. ABQ RIDE also operates a free circulator bus service in the downtown area named Downtown Get Around (or \"D-Ride\" for short) which runs from 6:30 am to 7:00 pm every 7 minutes on weekdays. D-Ride service will end on May 12, 2018, and will be replaced by various local routes, such as 12th Street/Rio Grande (routes #36 and #37) and Menaul (route #8). All inbound routes to the Alvarado Transportation Center, except route #66 and Rapid Ride routes, will have a fare-free zone.\n\nIn addition to local bus transit, the Alvarado Transportation Center also incorporates Amtrak and Greyhound bus facilities, as well as a stop on the New Mexico Rail Runner Express commuter rail line. The rail runner express provides commuter service seven days a week along a 96.5-mile corridor that runs through multiple counties in New Mexico through 13 stations.\n\n"}

{"id": "19463862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19463862", "title": "Employee voice", "text": "Employee voice\n\nEmployee voice refers to the participation of employees in influencing organisational decision making. Because research and analysis have grown around the voice concept in a variety of disciplines, ‘employee voice’ has become an elastic term meaning somewhat different things to different policy, academic and practitioner actors. In the many disciplines that cover voice, such as human resource management, political science, economics, organisational behaviour, psychology or law, perspectives toward the concept differ. Drawing on Dundon et al. voice can be seen with different lenses. First, voice is an articulation of individual dissatisfaction or concern that aims to address a specific problem or issue with management. Second, voice takes the form of collective organisation, where voice provides a countervailing source of power to management. Third, there is the role of voice as a contribution to management decision-making. Here the purpose is to gain employee input to improve work organisation and efficiency more generally, perhaps through quality circles or teamwork, or eliciting workforce engagement. Fourth, voice can be seen as an instrument for mutual gain, with productive collaboration between capital and labour increasing the long-term viability of an organisation and economic well-being of employees. The editors of the Elgar Handbook of Employee Voice define employee voice as the ways and means through which employees attempt to have a say and potentially influence organisational affairs about issues that affect their work and the interests of managers and owners. This definition combines a variety of voice mechanisms that analysts often group in separate boxes (e.g. involvement or bargaining; union and non-union). It allows for employer implemented Non-union Employee Representative (NER) systems as a collective form of voice, be it chosen to marginalise a union presence or to provide an alternative to union influence In general, employee voice is about how employees are able to have a say over work activities and decisions within the organizations in which they work, regardless of the institutional channel through which it operates—whether through speak-up programmes, quality circles, teamwork, or collective negotiation.\n\nArguments for employee voice can be both moral and political as well as economic. There are a wide range of mechanisms related to employee voice, and these may be direct or indirect, formal or informal, and power-centred or task-centred. As well as trade union representation, voice may refer to a wide array of techniques including Empowerment, Employee Engagement and Teamworking initiatives. In reality, many employers adopt a blend of voice mechanisms. However, some employers may also wish to limit employee voice, believing instead that the best approach is for management to command and control the organisation. Equally, some employees may not want to have their voice heard, or may not want to express their thoughts.\n\nIn July 2013, an international workshop on the benefits of employee voice was organised by Dr Andrew R Timming, an employee voice scholar based at the University of St Andrews. The workshop, entitled, 'Strengthening Democracy at Work', brought together the world's leading employee voice researchers, including: Peter Ackers (University of Loughborough), John Budd (University of Minnesota), Tony Dundon (National University of Ireland, Galway), Stewart Johnstone (University of Newcastle), Andrew Pendleton (York University) and Andrew Timming (University of St Andrews). Also present were several practitioners. The workshop was funded by the Scottish Universities Insight Institute and the Russell Trust. The first day took place in Glasgow and the second day was held at New Lanark. The workshop participants discussed the benefits of employee voice for employees, organisations and societies. In short, when employers give employees a 'say' in the strategic direction of the organisation, all three levels benefit.\n\nEmployee voice is attained through both informal and formal mechanisms. Informal employee voice mechanisms include general conversation between employees and employers, email communication, employee feedback, social functions and meetings at the workplace. Employees can also influence corporate decision making through their actions, such as turnover and absenteeism\n\nFormal mechanisms include communication tools implemented by an organisations human resource department, such as employee surveys and suggestion boxes. Some organisations promote employee voice through financial participation, such as share ownership and profit-sharing opportunities. Employee consultative committees and representation through trade unions are also formal ways of ensuring employees are informed and are given a voice in decisions that affect their employment\n\nIn an international context, the role of employee voice varies immensely. The European model is fundamentally based on employee communication and consultation between employees and corporate management. European Works Councils were introduced through the European Directive 1994 to accommodate these goals and provided employees with an opportunity to gain access to senior levels of their employers. The European model has required amendments to improve its effectiveness in managing employee voice and legal compliance\n\n"}
{"id": "645516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=645516", "title": "Euronymous", "text": "Euronymous\n\nØystein Aarseth (; 22 March 1968 – 10 August 1993), better known by his stage name Euronymous, was a Norwegian guitarist. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem and was the only constant member from the band's formation in 1984 until his death in 1993. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete.\n\nEuronymous professed to be a Satanist and was known for making extreme misanthropic statements. He presented himself as leading a militant cult-like group known as the \"Black Metal Inner Circle.\" \n\nIn August 1993, he was murdered by fellow musician Varg Vikernes.\n\nAarseth formed Mayhem in 1984 along with bassist Jørn \"Necrobutcher\" Stubberud and drummer Kjetil Manheim. At the time he was going by the stage name Destructor but later changed his name to Euronymous, derived from the demon Eurynomos which had inspired the Hellhammer song of the same name.\n\nIn summer 1986, Euronymous, Necrobutcher and Jon \"Metalion\" Kristiansen visited the German thrash metal band Assassin and recorded the \"Metalion in the Park\" demo under the name Checker Patrol, Metalion contributing background vocals to the title song \"Metalion in the Park.\"\n\nIn 1988, Per \"Dead\" Ohlin became Mayhem's vocalist and Jan Axel \"Hellhammer\" Blomberg became its drummer. By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near Kråkstad, which was used as a place for the band to rehearse. Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, Dead and Euronymous \"got on each other's nerves a lot\" and \"weren't really friends at the end.\" Hellhammer recalls that Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous then went outside and began shooting into the air with a shotgun. Varg Vikernes claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife.\n\nOn 8 April 1991, Dead was found dead by Euronymous at his home with slit wrists and a shotgun wound to the head. Dead's death was considered suicide. Before calling the police, he went to a shop and bought a disposable camera with which he photographed the body, after rearranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: \"Dawn of the Black Hearts\". Necrobutcher recalls how Euronymous told him of the suicide:Øystein called me up the next day ... and says, \"Dead has done something really cool! He killed himself\". I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, \"Relax, I have photos of everything\". I was in shock and grief. He was just thinking how to exploit it. So I told him, \"OK. Don't even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures\".\n\nEuronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's \"evil\" image and claimed Dead had killed himself because death metal had become \"trendy\" and commercialized. In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a stew with bits of Dead's brain and had made necklaces with bits of his skull. The band later denied the former rumor but confirmed that the latter was true. Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy, which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like Bård \"Faust\" Eithun and Metalion.\n\nNecrobutcher later speculated that taking the photographs and forcing others to see them was a way for Euronymous to cope with the shock of seeing his friend dead. He claimed that Euronymous \"went into a fantasy world.\" Faust of Emperor believes that Dead's suicide \"marked the point at which, under Euronymous' direction, the black metal scene began its obsession with all things satanic and evil.\" Kjetil Manheim said that, after the suicide, Euronymous \"tried to be as extreme as he had talked about.\" The suicide caused a rift between Euronymous and some of his friends, who were disgusted by his attitude towards Dead before the suicide, and his behavior afterwards. Necrobutcher ended his friendship with Euronymous. Thus, after the suicide, Mayhem was left with only two members: guitarist Euronymous and drummer Hellhammer. Stian \"Occultus\" Johannsen was recruited as Mayhem's new singer and bassist. However, this was short-lived; he left the band after receiving a death threat from Euronymous.\n\nDuring May–June 1991, Euronymous opened a record shop named \"Helvete\" (Norwegian for \"hell\") at Schweigaards gate 56 in Oslo. Norwegian black metal musicians often met in the shop's basement, including the two members of Mayhem, the members of Emperor, Varg \"Count Grishnackh\" Vikernes of Burzum, and Snorre \"Blackthorn\" Ruch of Thorns. Euronymous also started an independent record label called Deathlike Silence Productions, which was based at Helvete. It released albums by Norwegian bands Mayhem and Burzum, and Swedish bands Merciless and Abruptum. Euronymous, Varg, and Emperor guitarist Tomas 'Samoth' Haugen all lived at Helvete at various times. Emperor drummer Faust also lived and worked there. The shop's walls were painted black and bedecked with medieval weapons, posters of bands, and picture discs, while its window featured a polystyrene tombstone.\n\nAccording to Occultus, the space that Euronymous rented \"was far too big and the rent was too high. That's the reason why it never did well.\" Only a small part of the building was used for the shop itself. Nevertheless, it became the focal point of the Norwegian black metal scene. Metalion, writer of the fanzine \"Slayer\", said that the opening of Helvete was \"the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene.\" Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,\nWithin just a few months [of Helvete opening], many young musicians had become obsessed with Euronymous and his ideas, and soon a lot of Norwegian death metal bands transformed into black metal bands. Amputation became Immortal, Thou Shalt Suffer turned into Emperor, and Darkthrone swapped their Swedish-inspired death metal for primitive black metal. Most notoriously, Old Funeral's guitar player Kristian (later renamed as Varg) Vikernes had already left the band to form his own creation, Burzum.\n\nEuronymous helped many younger bands in the scene, especially Emperor and Enslaved, both of whom he recommended to Candlelight Records. Ihsahn of Emperor said that \"if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious in your views, you were accepted\" by the Helvete scene. Euronymous \"took Vikernes, who was five years younger than him, under his wing: inviting him to play bass with Mayhem and offering to release his music as Burzum\". However, it has been claimed that their friendship turned to rivalry. Looking back, Faust said: \"It sounds really silly, but I think there was a little bit of a contest between them to see who could be more evil. It created a very difficult situation, especially for Euronymous, who wanted the glamour and the showbiz. With him, there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire\".\nOn 6 June 1992, the Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen was destroyed by arson. Vikernes is strongly suspected as the culprit but was never convicted. There followed a wave of church burnings across Norway perpetrated by musicians and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene. Euronymous was present at the burning of Holmenkollen Chapel together with Vikernes and Faust, who were convicted for the arson after Euronymous was dead. Faust says he believes that Euronymous got involved because he \"felt he had to prove that he could be a part of it and not just in the background.\" To coincide with the release of Mayhem's \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", Vikernes and Euronymous had allegedly plotted to bomb Nidaros Cathedral, which appears on the album cover. Euronymous' death in August 1993 put an end to this plan and stalled the album's release. In a 1993 interview on a Swedish radio show, Euronymous said of the church burnings:They [Christians] must feel that there is a dark, evil power present that they have to fight, which…will make them more extreme. We also believe that when a church burns it's not only Christians who suffer, but people in general. Imagine a beautiful old stave church...what happens when it burns? The Christians feel despair, God's house is destroyed and ordinary people will suffer from grief because something beautiful was destroyed. So you end up spreading grief and despair, which is a good thing.\n\nIn January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, \"Bergens Tidende\", brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight. Varg Vikernes (using his pseudonym Count Grishnackh) gave an anonymous interview to a journalist from the newspaper, in which he claimed to have burnt the churches and killed a man in Lillehammer. According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete. He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Vikernes himself was released in March 1993, also for lack of evidence. That month, \"Kerrang!\" published an article about the Norwegian black metal scene. In it, Euronymous and Vikernes presented themselves as leaders of a militant, cult-like group of \"Satanic terrorists.\" Euronymous claimed that Helvete helps fund its activities, but said that he is not directly involved in its crimes, because if he was caught the organization would fall apart.\n\nAfter the \"Bergens Tidende\" episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media. Vikernes and the authors of \"Lords of Chaos\" claim that Euronymous' parents pressured him into shutting Helvete.\n\nIn early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, as well as between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene as a whole.\n\nOn the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre \"Blackthorn\" Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Tøyengata in Oslo. Upon their arrival, a confrontation began, and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back. Euronymous' murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media.\n\nIt has been speculated that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at \"outdoing\" the stabbing in Lillehammer. Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up, and torture him to death while videotaping the event. Vikernes explains: \"If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me.\" He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him. Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor. Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous \"panicked\" and kicked him in the chest. The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle. After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes. The self-defense story is doubted by Faust and other members of the scene.\n\nAccording to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was \"in the wrong place at the wrong time\". Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost committed to a mental hospital but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, \"I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Øystein\". Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a \"defense […] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]\".\n\nVikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, \"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\". Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.\n\nAt Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" album. Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: \"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was rerecording the bass parts, but I never did.\" The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994.\n\nA part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous and turning his back on Satanism in favor of nationalism and Odinism, although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used Satan to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers \"have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death.\" A few years after the murder, Ihsahn of Emperor said, \"There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop.\" After his death, a \"cult developed around the memory of Euronymous,\" and he was hailed by some as \"the King\" or \"Godfather of Black Metal.\" \n\nA new generation of musicians also tried to gain credibility by riding on the back of his legacy. However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates \"speak of the killing with a tone of indifference.\" \"Lords of Chaos\" remarks: \"what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another.\" In the book, Hellhammer, Ihsahn and Samoth claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. Anders Odden (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: \"It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences.\" He added: \"I think many people felt relief once he was gone.\" Writer and musician Erlend Erichsen agreed, saying, \"Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone.\"\n\nThe book \"Lords of Chaos\" says of Euronymous:He was always dressed in black from head to foot, his hair dyed black for added effect. He sported long, aristocratic mustaches and wore knee-high boots. His black leather biker jacket was decorated with badges [...] When talking, he seemed stern and serious, sometimes with pomposity verging on the theatrical\".\n\nIn interviews, Euronymous claimed to be against individualism, compassion, peace, happiness and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil. In a 1992 interview, he said \"The hardcore [punk] pigs have correctly made themselves guardians of morality, but we must kick them in the face and become guardians of anti-morality.\" The following year, he told \"Kill Yourself\" zine, \"There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted\" and claimed \"I have no problem with killing someone in cold blood.\" Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985 and considered him his best friend) said Euronymous \"was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts [...] worshipping death and being extreme\". Euronymous' shop attracted a lot of new young fans, many of whom looked up to and even idolized him.\n\nHowever, some who knew Euronymous claim that \"the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that — a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality.\" They include Necrobutcher, Kjetil Manheim, Vikernes and Blackthorn. Faust said that with Euronymous, \"there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire.\" When asked why Euronymous made such extreme statements to the press, Ihsahn said: \"I think that was very much to create fear among people.\" He added that the scene \"wanted to be in opposition to society\" and \"tried to concentrate more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy.\" Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim (Euronymous' friend from 1983 until his death) described him as \"health oriented ... A nice guy, a family guy,\" but said that when his older friends weren't around, \"he could play out his role.\" Manheim claimed that Euronymous became \"extreme\" towards the end of his life: \"He liked telling people that they were worthless; that he was the best. He was all 'I define black metal. Black metal is me!' … I think he was trapped in the image of Mayhem. He became a megalomaniac.\" In the documentary \"Pure Fucking Mayhem\", he said \"Øystein's daily life was a total theater\" that was based on the black metal \"archetype\" of Euronymous.\n\nIn interviews, Euronymous said he was a theistic Satanist.\nIn an interview by Esa Lahdenperä conducted in August 1993, Euronymous stated:\nI believe in a horned devil, a personified Satan. In my opinion all the other forms of Satanism are bullshit. [...] Satanism comes from religious Christianity, and there it shall stay. I'm a religious person and I will fight those who misuse His name. People are not supposed to believe in themselves and be individualists. They are supposed to OBEY, to be the SLAVES of religion. \n\nThe theistic Satanism espoused by Euronymous was an inversion of Roman Catholic dogma, and he claimed \"We praise the evil and we believe blindly in a godly creature just like a Christian.\" On the relationship between religion and science, he said: \"Scientists can't disprove [...] religion. No matter how hard you try, you can't explain the universe. You can't leave out a religious belief.\"\n\nHe opposed the Satanic and occultist teachings of Anton LaVey and Aleister Crowley, for unlike Euronymous, they promoted what he saw as \"peace\" and commercial frivolity, as well as individualism in contrast to dogma. He said he would \"never accept any band which preaches Church of Satan ideas, as they are just a bunch of freedom and life-loving atheists, and they stand exactly the opposite of me.\" When asked what he thought of Crowley's code of \"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law\", he answered, \"People shall do what WE want them to do. We're against freedom, and forced a band from Rogaland in Norway—Belsebub—to split up.\"\n\nAs noted earlier, some of those who knew Euronymous claim that his \"extreme Satanic image\" was an act. While Mortiis said that Euronymous \"was such a devil worshipper you wouldn't believe it,\" in the black metal documentary \"Until the Light Takes Us\", Varg Vikernes claimed that Euronymous was not a Satanist. He said: \"To Aarseth everything was about image and he wanted to appear extreme. He wanted people to think of him as being extreme; the most extreme of them all. But he didn't want to \"be\" extreme and he wasn't \"really\" extreme.\" While Metalion, who was friends with both Vikernes and Euronymous when the latter died, and called Euronymous his best friend, wrote that \"some people in our scene read a few books and considered themselves Satanists,\" he made no such statements about Euronymous. Tenebris (allegedly Jon Nödtveidt) from the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, a Swedish Satanic order formed in 1995, wrote that \"back then, in 1991, things mainly concerned black metal and ideological Satanism […] and kind of stood and fell with Euronymous and his shop. Therefore, it vanished with his death in '93\".\n\nOver time, some members of the Norwegian scene began to follow Paganism. Vikernes later claimed that Euronymous—\"obsessed with this 'Satanist' thing\"—disapproved of Vikernes promoting paganism. Euronymous showed no explicit disapproval of paganism though, and released the pagan band Enslaved's first album, \"Vikingligr Veldi\", on Deathlike Silence Productions.\n\nEuronymous said that the term \"black metal\" can apply to any kind of metal so long as it is \"Satanic\" and \"heavy\". He said, \"If a band cultivates and worships Satan, it's black metal,\" and that \"in a way, it can be ordinary heavy metal or just noise. What's important is that it's Satanic; that's what makes it black metal.\" He rejected bands like Immortal being called black metal, \"as they are not Satanists,\" but supported the band nonetheless. As noted earlier, bands who had LaVeyan beliefs were also rejected. When it was pointed out that Venom (the band that coined the term \"black metal\") only used Satanism as a gimmick, Euronymous said that he and the Black Circle \"choose to believe otherwise.\"\n\nLikewise, Euronymous said that the term death metal can apply to any kind of metal, so long as the band \"cultivates and worships death.\" Euronymous lamented the commercialization and loss of extremity within death metal. He said \"Real Death Metal should be something normal people are afraid of, not something mothers can listen to,\" and \"Death Metal is for brutal people who are capable of killing, it's not for idiotic children who want to have [a] funny hobby after school\".\n\nLike many others in the black metal scene, Euronymous originally believed that black metal should stay underground. However, he later changed his mind. He believed that the idea of staying underground came from hardcore punk, and said, \"Those who scream most about being in 'underground' is also often those who make so bad music that they don't have a chance to get big themselves.\" He added: \"I wouldn't mind making DSP big and earn a million, as long as I don't change my ways of thinking and being. […] If there were one million black metal fans in the world, most of them would be jerks, but there would be really many true and brutal people as well. The bigger we get, the more we can manipulate people into thinking like us\".\n\nEuronymous was interested in totalitarian communist states such as the Soviet Union under Stalin and Romania under Nicolae Ceaușescu. He collected Eastern Bloc memorabilia, and in the '80s, he was a member of the Norwegian communist youth group Rød Ungdom, which was Marxist-Leninist at the time. He left Rød Ungdom, allegedly because he came to realise that they were \"just a bunch of humanists.\" He said \"as I HATE people I don't want them to have a good time, I'd like to see them rot under communist dictatorship.\" He had a fascination with the idea of mass surveillance, secret police and forced disappearance. Mayhem's Attila Csihar said Euronymous was not a communist \"in the political sense\" but was fascinated by the power communist dictators had over their people.\n\nIn a private letter written in the early '90s, Euronymous claimed that \"almost all\" Norwegian black metal bands at the time were \"more or less Nazis,\" including Mayhem. He did not, however, use the music of Mayhem to promote any kind of politics.\n\nEuronymous played a Standard sunburst Gibson Les Paul guitar, which can be seen in many pictures of him playing. He stated in various interviews that his and Mayhem's main influences were Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer, Sodom and Destruction, whilst he also liked Iron Maiden, Kiss, Celtic Frost and Metallica. He played through a slightly modified 1981 Marshall Super Lead tube amp and used an Ibanez Tube Screamer pedal, as well as an Arion Metal Master distortion pedal.\n\nEuronymous was ranked No. 51 out of \"The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time\" by \"Guitar World\".\n\nIn March 2012, low-cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle set up a public poll asking customers to pick a famous Norwegian historic figure whose picture would decorate the aircraft's tail fin. Aarseth was leading the poll, but his name was removed from the campaign after his family's request.\n\nEuronymous played guitar on the following albums except where noted, any additional instruments or credits in notes.\n\n"}

Fazenda now denotes any kind of farm.\n\nFazendas created major export commodities for Brazilian trade, but also led to intensification of slavery in Brazil. Coffee provided a new basis for agricultural expansion in southern Brazil. In the provinces of Rio de Janeiro and then São Paulo, coffee estates, or \"fazendas\", began to spread toward the interior as new lands were opened. By 1850, coffee made up more than 50% of Brazil's exports, and more than half of world coffee production.\n\nAlong with the expansion of coffee growing came an intensification of slavery in Brazil, as the country's primary form of labor. More than 1.4 million Africans were forced to be slaves in Brazil in the last 50 years of the slave trade, and even after the trans-Atlantic slave trade ended, slavery continued until 1888.\n\nBecause of the increased profit from the trade of coffee, the years after 1850 saw considerable growth and prosperity in Brazil. Dom Pedro II proved to be willing to expand economic prosperity, even if that prosperity was based on slave labor. Railroads, steamships and the telegraph were introduced to Brazil, all paid for by the money the fazendas supplied from their coffee crop. In growing cities such as Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, merchants, lawyers, a middle class, and an urban working class grew, once again paid for by the money coming from the fazendas.\n\n"}

Andresen Sr. lived, Andresen added 'Jr.' to his name, but ended this practice when his father died in 2011.\n\nAndresen was born in 1961 in Oslo, as the son of industrialist Johan Henrik Andresen (1930–2011), and Swedish noblewoman Marianne Ebba Therese Bielke. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government and Policy Studies from Dartmouth College in 1988, and an MBA in 1993 from the Rotterdam School of Management.\n\nAndresen is married to Kristin Gamlemshaug. The couple has two daughters, Katharina and Alexandra. In 2007, Andresen transferred most of the Ferd Holding shares, for an estimated value of NOK 12 billion, to his daughters. He is the grandson of Johan H. Andresen, and the great-grandson of Johan Henrik Andresen.\n\nAndresen was Product Manager in International Paper Co., USA from 1989 to 1991. In 1993 he became a Partner in the Norwegian industrial group Tiedemanns-gruppen. He succeeded his father as the sole owner and CEO in 1998, and thus became the fifth generation of the Andresen family in charge of the company since the first Johan H. Andresen bought the tobacco company J.L. Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik in 1849. In 1998 the tobacco production of Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik was merged with the Scandinavian Tobacco Company, and in 2005 Andresen sold all his shares in the company for NOK 3.3 billion.\n\nTiedemanns-gruppen changed its name to Ferd in 2001. Today, Ferd owns Elopak, Aibel (50%),TeleComputing, Interwell and Swix Sport, among other companies, in addition to substantial portfolios of stock, hedge fund investments, Private Equity and property. The company’s net asset value has grown from NOK 7,4 billion in 2003 to NOK 24,3 billion as of year’s end 2013.\n\nIn September 2006, Andresen famously attempted to acquire the Swiss packaging and former weapons producer SIG, by placing a bid of NOK 11 billion for 50.01% of the shares in the company. Andresen's plan was to merge SIG with Ferd-owned Elopak, making it the world's second largest packaging manufacturer. SIG, however, initiated a bidding war, and in March 2007 Ferd announced that it would no longer be pursuing the transaction. This would have been one of the largest acquisitions in Norwegian history.\n\nAndresen chairs the Council on Ethics for the Government Pension Fund Global. He is Chairman of the Board of Ferd AS, and serves as a board member of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEB) in Sweden, NMI – Norwegian Microfinance Initiative, Junior Achievement –Young Enterprise, Europe, and Junior Achievement –Young Enterprise, Norway (Ungt Entreprenørskap).\n\nIn 2006, Andersen initiated a collaborative project between public and private interests. This led to the launching of NMI – Norwegian Microfinance Initiative in 2008, a microfinance institution aimed at stimulating growth in impoverished countries. In 2009 he formed Ferd Social Entrepreneurs, a separate non-commercial business area within Ferd that supports selected organizations, projects and individuals in activities where the social results carry greater weight than the financial results.\n\n"}

As defined by Steve Banks : “Start-up entrepreneurs have a more idealistic mentality, being more socialist, vs. the SME entrepreneurs, which are more financially driven. It is a “temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.” A startup is searching for answers to the product it will sell, the customer it will serve and the way it will make money from delivering value to its customers.\n\nA business which falls under the \"Republic Act 9501 Magna Carta for Micro, Small, Medium Enterprise (MSME)\" is eligible of the following incentives from the BMBE:\nThe government, in its objective to strengthen Barangay Micro Business Enterprises in the country and provide more jobs, livelihood and a better quality of life for Filipinos, has enacted Republic Act 9178, otherwise known as the “Barangay Micro Business Enterprises Act of 2002”.\n\nIn other words, a business or activity may be eligible to register as BMBE if they meet the following criteria:\n\nSenator Bam Aquino was reported to announce his intention to pass two bills on MSMEs within a year. These are: the Small Business Tax Reform Act, which aims to give MSMEs a three-year operation period before imposing taxes; and the Philippine Startup Bill, which seeks to provide a viable environment for startups.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has announced during his SONA held on July 25, 2016 that he vows to carry out the following during his term:\nDTI Region 10 has held the \"Negosyo Konsumer at iba pa\" for MSMEs and consumers last August 17–19, 2016 in Cagayan de Oro.\n\nThe activity included the launching of a fabrication laboratory; innovation technopreneurship; the Negosyo Center in the region; an E-Commerce forum; and a host of trainings for various business types.\n\nSince the third quarter of 2016, a move to empower micro businesses through an active eco system of support through funding, logistics and creative guidance has begun to take place. The move challenges everyone to consider the micro business model as a viable business option, and empowers aspiring entrepreneurs to pursue their business goals with the support they need. It gives due emphasis to the microbusiness model and how it can grow into a strong and stable enterprise that generates a steady stream of income, enough for it to expand as a world-class conglomerate while staying in the micro model.\n\nIt challenges the status quo to #thinkmicro, as the current hashtag relating to this school of thought suggests.\n\nThe move is both a nod and a push toward greater influence to earlier efforts of business advocates with similar intentions. Among them, the Go Negosyo]and DTI’s Kapatid campaign; Josiah Go's mentoring programs; and PLDT's SME Nation \"Ka-Asenso\" campaign.\n\n\n"}

In these cases it is contrasted with the term \"gross\", which refers to the pre-deduction value. For example, net income is the total income of a company after deducting its expenses—commonly known as profit—or the total income of an individual after deducting his or her income tax. Profit may be broken down further into pre-taxed or gross profit and profit after taxes or net profit. Similarly, an individual's net worth the difference between their assets (what they own) and their liabilities (what they owe to others).\n\nSimilarly, net investment in physical capital such as machinery equals gross (total) investment minus the dollar amount of replacement investment that offsets depreciation of pre-existing machinery, thus giving the change in the amount of machinery available for use. Likewise, net national product equals gross national product minus depreciation.\n\nThe word \"net\", in this sense, originally derives from the Latin \"nitere\" (to shine) and \"nitidus\" (elegant, trim), and more recently from the French \"net\" (sharp, neat, clean).\n\nIn this sense, it may appear, separated by a comma, \"following\" the noun it modifies, e.g., \"earned two million dollars, net\".\n\n"}

After claiming that Aeroflot worked as a \"cash cow to support international spying operations\", he was arrested and tried in Russia on the allegation of channeling Aeroflot money through another company in 1999. He was convicted and released in 2004, after serving three years. He emigrated to the UK in 2010 and received political asylum. In 2017 he was convicted in absentia in Russia for allegedly stealing money from Aeroflot, but his extradition from Britain had been denied. Initially treated as \"unexplained\", his death is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police who are now treating it as a murder inquiry.\n\nIn 1972, Nikolai Glushkov graduated from the Moscow Peoples' Friendship University with a degree in physics. In 1981, he completed the Academy of Foreign Trade with a degree in economics.\n\nGlushkov had been AvtoVAZ's Finance Chief until he left his job in autumn 1995 and was appointed as Deputy General Director of Aeroflot on request from Yevgeny Shaposhnikov in February 1996. According to Alexander Goldfarb, he found that the airline company worked as a \"cash cow to support international spying operations\": 3,000 people out of the total workforce of 14,000 in Aeroflot were FSB, SVR, or GRU officers. All proceeds from ticket sales were distributed to 352 foreign bank accounts that could not be controlled by the Aeroflot administration. Glushkov closed all these accounts and channeled the money to Swiss company called Andava in Switzerland. He also sent a bill and wrote a letter to SVR director Yevgeny Primakov and FSB director Mikhail Barsukov, asking them to pay the salaries of their intelligence officers in Aeroflot in 1996. Both Glushkov and Berezovsky were the main shareholders of Andava at that time.\n\nIn 1996, a Forbes article claimed that Glushkov was convicted of theft in 1982. Glushkov and Berezovsky sued Forbes for libel in the United Kingdom, with the ruling coming down against the publisher.\n\nGlushkov was arrested in December 2000 by Russian law enforcers and charged with channeling money through his accounting center \"Andava\". He was a business partner and close friend of Boris Berezovsky, who from November 2000 resided in Britain; Berezovsky had to give up his ownership of the ORT TV channel transferred them to Roman Abramovich's Sibneft) in exchange for the promise to release Glushkov, which was not fulfilled.\n\nIn April 2001 Andrey Lugovoy organized an \"escape\" of Glushkov from a hospital where he was kept by authorities. According to Glushkov, that was a set-up by FSB. He had no intention to escape and \"was walking in his slippers to the hospital gate to go home for the night, with his guards' knowledge, as he had done a few days earlier\".\n\nDuring his trial, Glushkov was incarcerated in Lefortovo Prison. He was cleared of the original fraud and money laundering charges by the court in March 2004, but found guilty of attempted escape and \"abuse of authority\" and sentenced to 3 years and 3 months of imprisonment. Glushkov was released in the courtroom, since he had already served his sentence in the pre-trial detention center. However, the Moscow City Court rejected the verdict and returned the case for new consideration. In 2006, the Savelovsky District Court terminated the prosecution of Glushkov, but gave him a two years of suspended sentence.\n\nGluskov emigrated to the UK and received political asylum in 2010. The Russian state resumed his criminal prosecution. In 2017, during a trial \"in absentia\" in Russia, Glushkov was sentenced to eight years in prison for allegedly stealing $123 million from Aeroflot. The UK refused to extradite him to Russia.\n\nOn 13 March 2018, friends of Glushkov revealed that he had been found dead the night before in his home in New Malden, London. His death was initially treated by police as unexplained. His death came a week after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, which along with his reputation as a critic of the Putin government, was said to be the reason for putting the Counter Terrorism Command in charge of the investigation. Glushkov reportedly feared being on Putin's hit list and expected to be a likely target.\n\nDuring the subsequent post-mortem his body was found to have marks consistent with strangulation on the neck. On 16 March 2018, the Metropolitan Police stated they were now treating his death as murder. However, they stated that \"at this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury\". Counter-terrorism investigators maintain a lead role in the investigation. The Russian Embassy in London has requested a meeting with the head of Scotland Yard over its investigation into the murder.\n\nIt was reported after his death that Glushkov may have been poisoned by two Russian men five years earlier. A paramedic said that he treated Mr Glushkov in Bristol in 2013 after he had collapsed in his room. He had been sharing drinks with two men from Moscow the night before at the Grand Hotel in Bristol and believed he had been poisoned with champagne. The paramedics found him with multiple carpet burns of his body and an unusual heart rhythm which they could not recognise.\n"}

Costs are assigned to products, usually in a large batch, which might include an entire month's production. Eventually, costs have to be allocated to individual units of product. It assigns average costs to each unit, and is the opposite extreme of Job costing which attempts to measure individual costs of production of each unit. Process costing is usually a significant chapter. It is a method of assigning costs to units of production in companies producing large quantities of homogeneous products..\n\nProcess costing is a type of operation costing which is used to ascertain the cost of a product at each process or stage of manufacture. CIMA defines process costing as \"The costing method applicable where goods or services result from a sequence of continuous or repetitive operations or processes. Costs are averaged over the units produced during the period\".\nProcess costing is suitable for industries producing homogeneous products and where production is a continuous flow. A process can be referred to as the sub-unit of an organization specifically defined for cost collection purpose.\n\nCosting is an important process that many companies engage in to keep track of where their money is being spent in the production and distribution processes. Understanding these costs is the first step in being able to control them. It is very important that a company chooses the appropriate type of costing system for their product type and industry. One type of costing system that is used in certain industries is process costing that varies from other types of costing (such as \njob costing) in some ways. In process costing unit costs are more like averages, the process-costing system requires less bookkeeping than does a job-order costing system. Thus, some companies often prefer to use the process-costing system.\n\nProcess costing is appropriate for companies that produce a continuous mass of like units through series of operations or process. Also, when one order does not affect the production process and a standardization of the process and product exists. However, if there are significant differences among the costs of various products, a process costing system would not provide adequate product-cost information. Costing is generally used in such industries such as petroleum, coal mining, chemicals, textiles, paper, plastic, glass, food, banks, courier, cement, and soap.\n\nCompan units of product in a given period of time.\n\nThere are four basic steps in accounting for Process cost:\n\nThe journal entries for process costing are the same as those for job-order costing with one exception. The entry to transfer cost from one work-in-process account to another is:\n\nWork-in-process inventory-second department Debit (Left)\n\nWork-in-process-first department Credit (Right)\n\ne.g.(1) Micro Labs Company produces house paint in two processing departments: the Mixing Department which mixes the paint colors and the Finishing Department which puts the paint in containers and labels them.

{"id": "5371565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5371565", "title": "Santa Fe, Mexico City", "text": "Santa Fe, Mexico City\n\nSanta Fe is one of Mexico City's major business districts, located in the west part of the city in the \"delegaciones\" (boroughs) of Cuajimalpa and Álvaro Obregón. The Paseo de la Reforma avenue and Constituyentes avenue are the primary means of access to the district from the central part of Mexico City. Santa Fe consists mainly of highrise buildings surrounding a large shopping mall, Centro Santa Fe, which is currently the largest mall in Latin America. The district also includes a residential area and three university campuses, among other facilities. The Toluca–Mexico City commuter rail, due to open in 2020, will also improve mobility and development in the district.\n\nThe current area of Santa Fe took its name from Santa Fé de México, the 16th century \"Pueblo Hospital of Santa Fe\", founded by Vasco de Quiroga in 1532. The ruins of the hospital still exist in the area.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial era (late 15th century – early 19th century) and the first century of independent Mexico (early 19th century – early 20th century), the then town of Santa Fe had an open landscape of sand mining activity, which was divided between the towns of Santa Fe, Santa Lucia, San Mateo and San Pedro in Cuajimalpa.\n\nSanta Fe was situated along the route of the former royal road connecting Tacubaya to Toluca. This road was located on the present-day avenue that is known by the name of Cuajimalpa Arteaga and Salazar, traversing the Sierra de las Cruces mountains and continuing by the current route of the federal interstate highway that connects Mexico City to Toluca. During the Porfiriato era, a steam tramline was built on the former royal road, which at first ended at Santa Fe, and later expanded to La Venta, Cuajimalpa, and San Ángel. Several trees were removed during the construction of the tramline towards San Ángel.\n\nThe presence of sandbanks in the area was exploited in the 1930s to feed the growing construction industry in Mexico City. The extraction of sand had the unfortunate consequence of creating a deep trench in the landscape, almost 4 km long by 2 km wide and in some places up to 100 meters in depth.\n\nA number of other land usage problems surfaced during this time period.\n\nIn 1953, after a derailment where several were killed in what is now the colony's Ocote Cuajimalpa, electric train service was withdrawn. the old royal road to Toluca already had by then strong competition from road federal Toluca, which runs along the west ridge which had to be stopped to avoid the collapse of the road. Today, in the south of the Calle 16 de Septiembre, one can see the outline of the path that requires them to leave the eastern ridge bordering the area and who once was a slum called Romita. This right of way gave rise to the Avenida Tamaulipas which connects with the road from Santa Lucia and the avenue Vasco de Quiroga.\n\nIn the 1960s, sand deposits became difficult to exploit because reinforcement of the walls became increasingly difficult and costly, so the mine owners began to sell the mines to the Federal District, which used it as landfill. Contrary to what is said, from the northern edge of Santa Fe Shopping Center to the area of the colony was used as Pena Blanca dump, even on the side of Cuajimalpa with tunnels that cross to walk of Tamarind. It was a mess that was duly closed and locked when President José López Portillo built his residential complex in the place popularly known as \"Dog Hill.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, an urban development plan was created for the area, which would be built in an industrial zone in the area to provide jobs to locals and develop import substitution, between what is planned consider creating the social rehabilitation center west \"Ceres\" like those built in the north, south and west of Mexico City. This plan did not consider the construction of residential areas as it was anticipated the weak capacity to carry water or drainage out of the area. This even had to be ratified by the boards of neighbors from the surrounding towns.\n\nIn the 1980s, most landfills had been closed and building construction had begun.\n\nIn 1982, the Universidad Iberoamericana was built on land donated by the Santa Fe unity government, marking the change from industrial land usage to the development of a residential area of great economic importance.\n\nDuring the administration of President Salinas de Gortari (1988–1994), the mayor of the city, Manuel Camacho Solís, and his colleagues devised a project that in theory would be similar to the edge city of La Défense in Paris, which would be located on existing landfills. A major risk due to building on existing landfills was the spread of contaminated water that would slip into Mexico City's water supply. Modern building techniques had to be initiated to spread several flattened layers of sand over millions of tons of garbage. To safely build upon the landfill, the City created a modern Master Program which the government and investors regulate.\n\nIt is in this decade that a construction boom began with the arrival of the Santa Fe Mall. At this time and under the authority of Manuel Camacho Solís, evictions were issued to the dwellers of Romita and other neighborhoods. Most of the dwellers have resettled in the San Jose neighborhood at Cuajimalpa. Through this avenue there is access to Tamaulipas and there started the construction of the toll highway Mexico-Toluca, which was to be extended on the outskirts of the city to reach the highway to Cuernavaca.\n\nAs a result of the economic crisis in Mexico in 1994, the master plan was halted and it was not until 2000 when the first phase of Santa Fe City was reinstated. Another of Santa Fe's original projects was cancelled, the so-called \"Mountain Meadows Park\", as the West Alameda Park; there are three other Alameda Parks in the northern, eastern, and southern parts of Mexico City.\n\nThe inadequate road infrastructure, energy, hydro power, which was originally planned for a residential zone, and residents, generated active participation in solving their basic problems, so they propose and manage a new organization where they create a sort of government procedure in which a special item given: the GDF without telling borough governments, leading to coordination problems. For example, for drinking water can not connect to networks and to get their Cuajimalpa sewage cannot connect to networks of Álvaro Obregón and no treatment plant exists in proximity. Hence the new Government of Mexico City \"GDF\" has presented proposals for solution, as a road tunnel that starts from the Roma to City Santa Fe, which fail to be viable the high economic investment.\n\nFor those circumstances, in 2011, the possibility of creating a new office in the area is considered. The new borough of Mexico City was seen more as a way of validating the almost self-government in the area for the trust that manages it because the proposal covers only residential and commercial areas of high economic level, excluding the low level found on its periphery, which are part of the problem, since that is where are the roads and networks that feed the area.\n\nAlong with the creation of Santa Fe industrial project in the 1970s was created a trust, where the government of the then Federal District \"DDF\" participate with their respective offices responsible for urban development, giving investors the facilities in the area electricity, lighting, roads, water and drainage to install its industry. But with the change of plans the plans were modified the characteristics of flows and inflows, which have great impact on the area.\nIn 1994 the Association of Settlers Zedec Santa Fe, CA with the first investors in this development, among these we have:\n\n\nResidents created the Association of Settlers Zedec Santa Fe in 1999, to present a common front to the problems that were found in the area.\n\nOn February 23, 2004 under the government of Marcelo Ebrard, who had been Secretary to the Government of the DDF under the government of the regent Manuel Camacho Solis, with infrastructure problems and challenges for the Federal District to meet the objectives of the original trust was created the Trust Colon de Santa Fe, constituted by the Government of the District Federal and Settlers Association Zedec Santa Fe This is because in its origin was an urban infrastructure development, where the federal government represented by the DDF was responsible for providing urban infrastructure for industrial use, even thought to use the right of way of the old railroad to build a radio station, connecting the cities of Toluca and Mexico. Something similar to the current \"Tren Suburbano\" (suburban train) from Buenavista Station to Cuautitlán, which is partly drawn from the current highway. For this reason it has kept the local governments out of both the administration and budgets have been invested in the area by the government. Not to mention that some areas for security reasons are closed to the public way, has had to hire police corps and industrial bank, has had to provide water supply service pipes and removal by sewage pipes also.\n\nThe agreement invested amounts are a percentage of property tax and are subject to review and approval expressed by the technical committee as the highest authority of the trust and trustee, this is composed of 7 members of which 4 are appointed by the association and the 3 remaining the Federal District government and decisions are taken by majority vote and at least 1 of the GDF with the president casting vote in case of tie and extraordinarily many times as needed.\n\nThe area defined by Mexico City’s government as the \"Zona de Santa Fe\" is in size and consists of the \"colonias\":\n\nBorders of the \"Zona de Santa Fe\" as described above are:\n\n\nAcademics from many universities in Mexico and abroad have studied Santa Fe's design. Some believe that the design is well-planned while others believe that the design is poor and will harm the area. Enrique Martín Moreno and María Moreno of Iberoamericana University characterize Santa Fe as a self-contained city where the inhabitants do not venture outside. Jeffrey Inaba of Harvard University argued that Santa Fe should build connections to other parts of Mexico City. Roque González, the author of the original Santa Fe development project, said in 2005 \"in 15 years will be a serious problem due to the fact that there are insufficient roads, public spaces, pedestrian areas. We're headed straight into gridlock and a lack of spaces usable by humans.\"\n\nThe airline Volaris has its headquarters in Colonia Zedec, Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón; previously they were in Peña Blanca, Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón. Grupo Bimbo has its headquarters in Peña Blanca, Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón. Chrysler Group Mexico has its head office in Santa Fe. Liverpool has its headquarters in Santa Fe and in Cuajimalpa.\n\nOther companies with business offices in Santa Fe include Best Buy, Huawei, Ford, Sony, Movistar (Telefónica), Microsoft, Televisa, Roche, PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Amazon, Apple Inc. among others.\n\nRoad access from central Mexico City remains inadequate, with Paseo de la Reforma and Avenida Constituyentes both congested at peak hours. Plans have been circulated to build a tunnel from the Circuito Interior in Condesa along Constituyentes to the point where it meets Reforma just before Santa Fe.\n\nIn 2013 the Supervía Poniente opened, a toll road linking Santa Fe with the Anillo Periférico ring road at San Jerónimo in southwestern Mexico City.\nJust west of Santa Fe, the Chamapa-La Venta toll road connects to the Interlomas edge city and points north.\n\nAs far as public transportation, there are pesero minibuses and regular public buses. The \"Ecobus\" connects Santa Fe with Metro Balderas in downtown Mexico City and other buses connect to Metro Tacubaya and Metro La Villa-Basílica.\n\nThe area will be connected by a commuter train in 2018 on the Toluca–Mexico City commuter rail.\n\nDespite the criticism Santa Fe continues its development. However, the lack of infrastructure and over-investment have created an oversupply of commercial real estate. According to Colliers the vacancy rate in Santa Fe is 27 percent (2005), the highest in the city. This oversupply in the commercial real estate market can also be seen in the monthly rent, having been the highest in the city for A+ buildings it is now in the average c (range of $20–25 per square meter), Higher that of the central Paseo de la Reforma and Polanco markets.\n\nPrivate schools in Santa Fe and Cuajimalpa:\n\nUniversities in Santa Fe and Cuajimalpa\n\n\n\n"}

He is principally associated with selling and racing De Dion-Bouton, Gladiator; Clemént-Panhard, Napier and AC cars.\n\nEdge was born in Concord township, near Sydney, on 29 March 1868; his parents were Alexander Ernest Edge and Annie Charlotte Sharp. At age three, he was taken to London where in his teens he competed successfully as a bicycle racer, winning the Westerham Hill climb when he was nineteen. One of the English Team and aged 23 he came 3rd in the first Bordeaux–Paris cycle race in 1891. He worked for Rudge then Harvey Du Cros as manager of his new Dunlop offices in London. In 1892 he married Eleanor Rose Sharp who died sometime before 1917; his second wife, Myra Caroline Martin, whom he married in 1917, had two daughters by him.\n\nFrom 1910 until at least 1922 he resided at Gallops Homestead, Ditchling, Sussex, and from 1912–19, courtesy of his contract with Napiers, he devoted himself to farming.\n\nHe died 12 February 1940 in Eastbourne, Sussex, England.\n\nIn 1899, he went into partnership with pioneering motorist Charles Jarrott and Herbert Duncan to found De Dion-Bouton British and Colonial Ltd as importers of cars. He had become friends with Montague Napier (of Napier & Son), another keen cyclist, and in 1898 asked Napier to carry out some improvements to his Panhard. In 1899, along with Harvey du Cros, Edge formed the Motor Vehicle Company Ltd to sell these improved cars, made by Napiers (Edge paid ₤400, selling at £500), as well as Gladiators and Clément-Panhards, both manufactured in Paris by Adolphe Clément-Bayard.\n\nIn 1907 \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" reported: \"S. F. Edge (1907), Ltd., has been registered at Somerset House, London, with a capital of £275,000, to carry on the business of motor car, cycle, launch, and flying machine manufacturers.\" He sold his company, S.F. Edge Ltd, to Napier in 1912, for £120,000. The sale included an agreement not to be involved in motor manufacturing for seven years. During this period he devoted himself to farming at Ditchling, Sussex.\n\nIn 1917 he was appointed controller of the agricultural machinery department of the Ministry of Munitions.\n\nWhen the embargo on motor manufacturing expired in 1919 he started to build up a shareholding in AC Cars, gaining full control in 1922. About 1923 Edge was also managing director of William Cubitt & Company, who had entered the car market with the Cubitt \"marque\", but were out of business by 1925. Edge switched the contract for purchasing engines for the AC car from Anzani, where he also sat on the board, to Cubitt, who produced what was essentially a copy of the Anzani design. Edge purchased AC cars outright for £135,000 in 1927. When AC collapsed in 1929, Edge sold his interest in the company and took no further business interest in the motor industry.\n\nRecognizing the value of publicity gained from auto racing, which no other British marque did, Edge entered an 8 hp (6 kW) four-cylinder Napier in the Automobile Club's 1900 Thousand Miles (1600 km) Trial of the Automobile Club on behalf of Edward Kennard; driven by Edge, with Kennard along, on a circuit from Newbury to Edinburgh and back, she won her class, being one of only thirty-five finishers (of sixty-four starters) and one of just twelve to average the requisite 12 mph (19 km/h) in England and 10 mph (16 km/h) in Scotland. He did the same (with C. S. Rolls his riding mechanic) at the 837 mi (1350 km) Paris-Toulouse-Paris rally in June; the car would be eliminated due to ignition trouble.\n\nIn the 1901 Gordon Bennett Cup, Edge entered a special 17-litre Napier which he was only able to test \"en route\" because it had been completed on 25 May, only four days before the event. Montague Napier was the riding mechanic. The car was too powerful for the Dunlop tyres and fitting new French tyres led to disqualification, since they were not of the same national of origin. In the concurrent Paris-Bordeaux rally, it retired with clutch trouble.\n\nFor the 1902 Gordon Bennett, Edge's Napier was the sole British entrant; with his cousin, Cecil Edge, as riding mechanic, he won, at an average 31.8 mph (51.2 km/h) (though by default, since the French entrants all fell out). The preparation of the car was hurried with some parts being fitted on the train to Paris. Additionally the second gear had not been hardened properly so, on arriving in Paris, Edge got the gear out, contacted his friend Adolphe Clément (Adolphe Clément-Bayard), borrowed his factory, hardened the gear, reassembled everything, and went on to win the race.\n\nAt the 1903 Gordon Bennett, Edge had an 80 hp (60 kW) Napier, the Type K5, but was disqualified. Edge (with Arthur McDonald, manager of Napiers' Genoa factory, as riding mechanic) fared no better with the K5 in the 1904 Gordon Bennett in Germany.\n\nIn 1903 Edge's eye for publicity created a world first when, on 2 October, Dorothy Levitt won her class at the Southport Speed Trials driving his 12 Hp Gladiator, shocking British society as she was the first woman, a working secretary, to compete in a 'motor race'. \n\nIn June 1907 Edge broke the 24-hour distance record, driving a 60 hp (44.7 kW) Napier six, at the newly opened Brooklands track, accompanied by riding-mechanic Joseph H Blackburn.(Born 17 December 1875 D 8 May 1919) He covered 1,581 miles (2544 km), 1,310 yards at an average speed of 65.905 mph (106.06 km/h). This record stood for 18 years. In 1910 Edge was awarded the Dewar Trophy for his drive in top gear in a Napier on the route London-Edinburgh-London.\n\nIn 1922 Edge returned to Brooklands in a Spyker setting a new \"Double 12\" world record covering 1,782 miles 1,066 yards (2,868 km 693 m) at an average speed of for the aggregate 24 hours.\n\nHis final contribution to motor racing was the inauguration of the Campbell Circuit at Brooklands in 1937.\n\nIn 1903 Edge won the inaugural British International Harmsworth Trophy for speedboats held on the River Lee, Queenstown, Cork Harbour, Ireland, in a boat called \"Napier I\". The steel-hulled, 'Napier' speedboat fitted with a 3-blade propeller, achieved . It was driven by Dorothy Levitt, but as both owner and entrant \"S.F.Edge\" is engraved on the trophy as the winner. The third crew member, Campbell Muir, may also have taken the controls.\n\nIn May 1905 \"The Rudder\" reported that :\n\nEdge, driving \"Napier II\", won the race for racers in the eight to 12 metres classes in 1 hour 5 minutes, he also finished second in \"Napier 1\" as it was common practice to describe the owner and entrant as the driver, even if he did not take the wheel.\n\n"}

{"id": "1317043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1317043", "title": "Trade and development", "text": "Trade and development\n\nTrade can be a key factor in economic development. The prudent use of trade can boost a country's development and create absolute gains for the trading partners involved. Trade has been touted as an important tool in the path to development by prominent economists. However trade may not be a panacea for development as important questions surrounding how free trade really is and the harm trade can cause domestic infant industries to come into play.\n\nThe current consensus is that trade, development, and poverty reduction are intimately linked. Sustained economic growth over longer periods is associated with poverty reduction, while trade and growth are linked. Countries that develop invariably increase their integration with the global economy, while export-led growth has been no no no they used writing to remember about the leaders \n\nContinents, countries and sectors that have not developed and remain largely poor have comparative advantage in three main areas:\n\n\nCrucially for poverty reduction, the latter two at least are labor-intensive, helping to ensure that growth in these sectors will be poverty-reducing. However, low value-added, price instability and sustainability in these commodity sectors means they should be used only temporarily and as stepping stones in the path to economic development.\n\nIn many developing countries, agriculture employs a large proportion of the labor force, while food consumption accounts for a large share of household income. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) notes that this means that “even small changes in agricultural employment opportunities, or prices, can have major socio-economic effects in developing countries”. Thus whatever the development strategy a particular country adopts, the role of agriculture will often be crucial. In 1994, the agricultural sector employed over 70% of the labor force in low-income countries, 30% in middle-income countries, and only 4% in high-income countries (UNCTAD 1999).\n\nIn poor countries with low population densities and enough suitable land area, which includes most countries in Africa and Latin America, agriculture is central to the economy. In poor regions and rural areas within middle-income developing countries, the concentration of poverty in rural areas of otherwise better-off developing countries makes the development of agriculture vital there. Finally, in Net Food Importing Developing Countries (NFIDCs), there is a positive link between growing agricultural exports and increases in local food production, which makes agricultural development if anything even more important, as food security and the financial stability of the government are also at stake. In Vietnam in the 1990s, increases in production and export of coffee of 15% a year contributed to a nearly 50% rise in food production in the same period. As agricultural GDP grew 4.6% per year, rural poverty fell from 66% in 1993 to 45% in 1998 (Global Economic Prospects 2002:40).\n\nAnderson et al. (1999) estimate annual welfare losses of $19.8 billion for developing countries from agricultural tariffs – even after Uruguay Round reforms. This is three times the loss from OECD import restrictions on textiles and clothing. A combination of better market access, and domestic reforms and foreign aid to enhance the ability of developing countries to take advantage of it, could have a significant impact on poverty reduction, and help to meet the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nThe largest beneficiaries of agricultural liberalization would be OECD countries themselves: welfare losses of $62.9bn a year are estimated as resulting from the distortionary policies (Binswanger and Ernst 1999:5). Nor is the traditional objective of OECD agricultural subsidy (supporting small farmers) achieved by this system in a manner that could be characterised as efficient: most of the producer support incomes goes to better-off farmers, with the poorest 40% receiving just 8% of the support spent.\n\nThe issue of market access to high-income countries is a thorny but crucial one. The issues fall into three main groups: first, those relating to deliberately imposed barriers to trade, such as tariffs, quotas, and tariff escalation. Second, barriers to trade resulting from domestic and external producer support, primarily in the form of subsidies, but also including, for example, export credits. Third, those relating to indirect barriers to trade resulting from developing countries’ lack of institutional capacity to engage in the global economy and in multilateral institutions (e.g., the World Trade Organization) on equal terms.\n\n\n\nThis includes non-tariff barriers such as food regulations and standards, which developing countries are often not (or not effectively) involved in setting, and which may be deliberately used to reduce competition from developing countries. In any case, the lack of capacity to meet implement regulations and ensure compliance with standards constitutes a barrier to trade, and must be met by increasing that capacity.\n\nResearchers at the Overseas Development Institute have identified many capacity related issues that developing economies face aside from tariff barriers:\nThe benefits of trade agreements for developing countries are not automatic, especially for SMEs whether or not they are already exporting as the costs of entering a new market are greater for them than for large companies when compared to their potential revenue.\n\n\nIt is important to recognise that the issues facing LDCs and middle-income developing countries differ significantly. For the middle-income countries, the primary issue is market access. Many of the world’s poor live in these countries, and so market access alone can have significant poverty-reducing effects in these countries. However, for the least developed countries, the principal problem is not market access, but lack of production capacity to achieve new trading opportunities. This is recognised by paragraph 42 of the Doha Development Agenda:\n\nSo while the further development of middle-income countries, and in particular the tackling of rural poverty in these countries, can be achieved most importantly through increased market access in agriculture, lower-income countries need additional help, not only to take advantage of new opportunities, but to be able to adapt to changing conditions due to the loss of preferences. This additional help must take three main forms: support for developing-country agricultural production; support for participation in trade; and support for good policies and good governance.\n\n\nCases such as Haiti’s post-1986 liberalization show that the opportunities thereby created will not be taken advantage of if macroeconomic policies, institutions, and the investment climate are not favorable. This includes\n\nGiven the importance of agriculture for poverty reduction, additional policies and institutional capacity are needed to ensure an effective supply response to market incentives provide by better market access. Rural infrastructure is particularly important in enabling agricultural exports in developing countries. Sufficient credit at competitive conditions is important for private sector investment in storage, transportation and marketing of agricultural products. Investment in skills and education in rural areas is needed to bolster agricultural productivity. Trade policy reforms must address any remaining anti-export bias. Efficient land policies and land tenure institutions are needed to ensure the functioning of land markets, property rights, and efficient farm structures.\n\nThe most recent round of World Trade Organization negotiations (the Doha \"Development\" Round) was promoted as being directed at the interests of developing countries, addressing issues of developed country protectionism. The introduction of the (investment-related) Singapore issues together with a lack of sufficient concessions to developing countries' interests has put the success of the negotiations in doubt.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9264170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9264170", "title": "Water supply and sanitation in Chile", "text": "Water supply and sanitation in Chile\n\nWater supply and sanitation in Chile is characterized by high levels of access and good service quality. Compared to most other countries, Chile's water and sanitation sector distinguishes itself by the fact that almost all urban water companies are privately owned or operated (the only exception is SMAPA). The sector also prides itself of having a modern and effective regulatory framework, including an innovative subsidy to water demand by the poor. One weakness of the sector is the relatively high water losses.\n\nThis article is part of a comparing the institutional and financial characteristics of water supply and sanitation around the world.\n\nIn 2015, in Chile 99% of the population had access to \"improved\" water, 99.6% and 93%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. In 2015, there were around 180 thousand people who lacked access to \"improved\" water. Regarding sanitation, in 2015, 99% of the population had access to \"improved\" sanitation, 100% and 90%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. Around 170 thousand still lacked access to it.\n\nOne of the reasons of the high coverage rates in Chile is the early effort for extending and improving the infrastructure (see below). As a result, in 1990 97% of the urban population was already connected to water and 84% to sanitation.\n\nService quality is generally good in Chile. It is regularly controlled by the SISS since it was founded in 1990. The agency examines if the services comply with the Chilean norm NCh 409, which was modified for the last time in 2005 and includes standards concerning water quality, water pressure and continuity among others. \nAt the beginning of the 1990s, there were problems regarding the chlorination systems of some water service providers. Consequently, in 1991 20% of the companies did not comply with the bacteriological norms. In 2006, this share had dropped to about 1%. In the same period, compliance with disinfection norms increased from 89% to more than 99%.\n\nWater supply is continuous (24/7), both in urban areas and in concentrated rural areas and water pressure is adequate.\n\nThe sector currently undergoes a major wastewater treatment investment program with the goal of treating 100% of all collected municipal wastewater in 2012. This share has increased from 8% in 1989 to 82% in 2006.\n\nWater use has gradually decreased since 1998. An estimated 96% of water consumption is measured resulting in precise information concerning water consumption. In 2006, the total water consumption was 958 million m³. Each customer therefore used on average 19.9 m³ per month, resulting in 196 liters daily p/capita. Water consumption is highest in the capital region, ranging from 44m3/month (Aguas Cordillera) to 125m3/month (Aguas de Manquehue).\n\nThe Chilean water supply and sanitation sector today is characterized by one of the best coverage and quality levels of Latin America. One of the reasons was a gradual and lasting extension of infrastructure which began in the 1970s. In the 1990s, most utilities improved their economic efficiency and became self-financing companies which were partially handed over to the private sector.\n\nBefore 1977, urban water and sewer services in Chile were provided by a multitude of public entities. The largest entity was the Sanitation Department (Dirección de Obras Sanitarias, DOS) of the Ministry of Public Works, which was in charge of service provision in towns outside of the two largest cities, Santiago and Valparaíso. In these two cities municipal utilities were responsible for service provision. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development also had water and sanitation departments. To guarantee its operation, the service was directly subsidized by the national government.!\n\nIn 1977, the national public water and sanitation company SENDOS (Servicio Nacional de Obras Sanitarias) was created which had 11 regional branches. The municipal utilities in Santiago and Valparaíso were corporatized and modernized. During that time employment in the utilities was significantly reduced.\n\nThe public utilities for Santiago and Valparaíso, EMOS (Empresa Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias) and ESVAL (Empresa Sanitaria de Valparaiso), were strengthened through loans from the World Bank during that period. In parallel, the government of General Augusto Pinochet privatized the electricity and telecommunications sector.\n\nWater coverage during this period increased substantially from 78% in 1976 to 98% in 1988. Sewer coverage increased from 52% in 1976 to 82% in 1988.\n\nIn 1988, the Chilean people denied General Augusto Pinochet a new term in a referendum, thus passing a key step in the country's transition to democracy. Unlike the privatization and liberalization in other infrastructure sectors, reform of the water and sanitation sector was thus not imposed by the military government but initiated in a climate of democracy.\n\nBetween 1988 and 1990, a number of legal reforms and the creation of new institutions had two principal objectives:\n\nTherefore, in December 1988 the General Water and Sanitation Law (Ley General de Servicios Sanitarios) allowed the granting of 13 regional concessions to public, private or mixed shareholding companies in each of Chile’s regions. In 1990 the regulatory agency SISS (Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios) was created through a separate law. An innovative model of tariff regulation was borrowed from the Chilean electricity and telecommunications sector: Efficient cost levels were estimated for an imaginary model company and used as a benchmark to set tariffs for the utilities. Means-tested subsidies (i.e. subsidies that are granted only to those that demonstrably have limited means) were also introduced at the same time to cushion the effect of the tariff increase on the poor. The legal framework with some modifications is still in force today.\n\nInitially, the regional companies remained public, but the intent was to prepare them for privatization. During that period they achieved financial self-sufficiency, were granted tariff increases, improved their efficiency and increased coverage. The regional companies were also transformed into private law companies (Sociedades Anónimas). Investments increased from less than US$ 80m annually on average during the 1980s to US$ 260m in 1998. However, regional utilities still did not have sufficient resources to expand wastewater treatment.\n\nUnder the government of Christian Democrat President Eduardo Frei, the law was amended in 1998 to promote private sector participation. The stated motive was to increase efficiency, to improve service quality and to mobilize capital to extend wastewater treatment. Subsequently, all regional branches of SENDOS, as well as the water and sanitation companies of Santiago and Valparaiso, were privatized. Staffing was further reduced, new complaints management procedures were introduced and the share of collected wastewater treated increased significantly.\nContrary to the case of many other Latin American cities where the private sector was asked to provide services, the Chilean service providers were financially self-sufficient when the private sector took responsibility for them. The public companies had been prepared to gradually improve efficiency and profitability since the legal reforms of 1988-1990. This may explain the stable process of private sector participation compared to other Latin American cases. A factor that explains the continuity of sector policies during various administrations is the fact that all Presidents since Chile's return to democracy in 1990 belonged to the same Coalition of Parties for Democracy.\n\nThe privatization was carried out in stages, beginning with the five largest of the 13 regional water companies serving more than 75% of users. Because of the staging, it is possible to compare the performance of the privatized and public utilities at that time. This comparison shows that from 1998 to 2001 private companies invested substantially more than public companies and - unlike the public companies - increased their labor productivity significantly. Tariffs increased for both types of companies, but more so for the privatized ones. However, according to one study, \"in Chile a social consensus emerged that has made the higher water rates acceptable given the improvements in service quality and the addition of new services such as wastewater treatment.\"\n\nThe participation of the private sector occurred in two different ways. From 1998 to 2001, when the biggest companies were privatized, the majority of their shares were sold to the private actors. The government then decided to not continue to sell parts of the companies, but to transfer the operation rights of the companies to private actors for 30 years between 2001 and 2004. This latter way of private sector participation, also known as concession, differs substantially from selling shares of the companies because the infrastructure remains property of the Chilean state. All seven companies which were privatized in the second way merged in 2005, assuming the name ESSAN.\n\nAccording to the World Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure database, investment commitments by the private sector in Chile's water and sanitation sector reached US$5.7 bn in 1993–2005 through 20 projects, with US$4 bn of commitments made in 1999 alone through 4 projects. 7 projects were divestitures, 10 were concessions and 3 were greenfield projects in wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThe Socialist Presidents Ricardo Lagos (2000–2006) and Michelle Bachelet (since 2006) maintained the basic institutional structure of the sector established under previous governments based on private service provision, means-targeted subsidies and regulation by a public, autonomous regulator.\n\nIn 2011, the state holding company Corfo sold its stakes in the three largest water companies—Aguas Andinas, Esval and Esbio—on the stock exchange, primarily to individual local and foreign shareholders. The sale of the 30% stake in Aguas Andinas alone brought the state revenues of USD 984 million. The sale of the stakes in the two other companies brought USD 564 million in revenues. However, the planned sale of shares in a fourth water company, Essal, was suspended because of low prices offered. In 2015, Antofagasta plc, which had won the concession for the local water supply in Antofagasta in 2003, sold its shares to the publicly owned Colombian multi-utility Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM)for USD 965 million.\n\nResponsibility for sector policy in Chile is vested primarily in the Ministry of Public Works, which grants concessions and promotes rural water supply and sanitation through its Department of Sanitation Programs. The responsibility for regulation is shared between the Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios SISS, the economic regulator in urban areas, and the Ministry of Health which controls drinking water quality standards in both urban and rural areas.\n\nThe SISS controls water and sanitation services in urban areas according to financial and quality norms (see above). To guarantee political independence, it is a decentralized organization with its own budget. The SISS has the right to impose fines on the service providers in case of violation of norms, which directly flow in the regulator's budget. Furthermore, it receives user complaints, assesses their validity and acts on them. The agency has databases of all 53 urban service providers.\n\nThe water and sanitation regulatory system in Chile is considered by the WHO to be a model not only for Latin America, but also for Europe. One of its innovative features is the use of a hypothetical efficient model enterprise to assist in determining if tariff increases requested by service providers are justified.\n\nIn the Chilean rural areas, the ministry of health and the ministry of economy are responsible for supervising water cooperatives and water committees. In rural areas there is no independent regulator, such as the SISS in urban areas. Since 1994, the Direction for Water Works (DOH) is in charge of executing the national program of Rural Potable Water (APR). Unlike urban service providers, rural water supply and sanitation sector has not been subject of regulation like urban services. Currently, the Government of President Bachelet has submitted before the Chilean Congress a Bill to give this sector a new institutional framework. According to Law 19,549 of 1998, urban concessionaires have to provide technical and administrative assistance to water committees and cooperatives in their respective region.\n\nThe responsibility for service provision is different in urban and rural areas.\n\nWater supply and sanitation services in Chile's urban areas is provided by 53 entities. To prevent monopolization, the providers were classified into three categories according to the percentage of the population served by them. No person or society is allowed to possess more than 49% of the companies within one category:\n\nThe three largest companies are\n\n\nTogether, the three companies serve 63% of urban water customers in Chile.\n\nUntil 2011, the Chilean state held 36% of water and sanitation companies through its Production Development Corporation (CORFO). Today, this share has substantially decreased. As shown in the following table which shows the situation of 2006, the majority of the sector was still owned by Chilean actors.\n\nThe Ontario Teachers Pension Plan from Canada is a major shareholder of the private water utilities Essbio and Esval.\n\nIn rural areas, local water cooperatives and water committees provide water supply services. In concentrated rural areas (i.e. rural communities with 150 to 3,000 inhabitants with a concentration of not less than 15 houses per km of water network), there was a significant development due to the national program of Rural Potable Water (APR). However, most isolated housings in Chile still lack adequate water connections.\n\nNon-revenue water (\"water losses\") in Chilean water companies was on average 34% in 2006, an unusually high level for a sector that is so modern in so many other aspects. The level of non-revenue water is thus still higher than in Germany, France or the United Kingdom. (see e.g. water losses in Germany). Indeed, non-revenue water in Chile increased from 29% in 1999 to the current 34%. The regulator considers a level of 15% efficient.\n\nIn 2006, on average one employee of the urban water supply and sanitation providers served 418 clients, resulting in 2.4 employees per 1000 connections, below the Latin American average of 5.\n\nTariff level Water tariffs in Chile differ substantially between regions, reflecting differences in the cost of supplying water. Tariffs in urban areas varied between US$0.8 (Aguas Manquehue in Chicureo) per cubic meter and US$4.1 (Aguas Patagonia in Coyhaique) per cubic meter in 2006. In rural areas, tariffs only cover operation and maintenance costs\n\nAffordability On average, the water and sanitation bill accounted for 1.14% of household income according to a 1998 survey by the National Statistical Institute. They varied between 0.77% for the highest (wealthiest) quintile and 2.35% for the lowest (poorest) quintile.\n\nFinancing and Subsidies Urban water and sanitation systems do not receive direct subsidies and are financed through the capital market, and ultimately through user fees. However, Chile has an innovative system of means-tested subsidies that allows qualifying poor households to receive a subsidy administered by the municipalities to pay parts of their water and sanitation bills. Rural water systems receive a partial investment subsidy that is defined in the Ley del Subsidio al Agua Potable y Saneamiento. By law, the subsidy can cover 25-85 percent of a household's water and sewer bill up to 15 m³ per month. The client pays the rest of the bill. Beyond 15 m³, households are charged full price. The subsidy is meant to target only those households that are unable to buy water at a subsistence level and is based on willingness to pay. In 1998, about 13% of households benefited at a level of ~$10 per month. The total cost of the program in 1998 was US $36 million. Opponents argue this subsidy program can act as a regressive policy and actually hurt the poor because a false assumption is made that high consumption is positively correlated to high income. On the contrary, poor families do not have access to efficient methods of using water in cooking, cleaning, and washing.\n\nInvestment Since the sector was prepared for self-sufficiency, investment increased significantly from an annual average of about US$ 100m in the period 1965 to 1989 to an annual average of US$ 242m in the period 1990 to 1998, when the first company was privatized. According to SISS, since 1998 the annual investment ranges between US$ 151m (1999) and US$ 443m (2002). Total investment in 2006 was US$ 325m.\n\nThe IDB supports the water and sanitation sector in Chile through two technical assistance grants:\n\nThe World Bank supports the water and sanitation sector through a US$90m project approved in 2005, of which about 30% will be used for rural water supply and sanitation. The project is being executed by the Vice-Ministry of Regional Development in the Ministry of Interior. Investments are being undertaken in Coquimbo, Maule Region, Bio-Bio Region, Araucania Region, and Los Lagos Region.\nApproved June 14, 2007, 20% of a US$30 million loan was appropriated and spent in the general water, sanitation, and flood protection sectors.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In his youth he studied economics and carved out a career as an accountant at a bank. In 1933 he joined the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) at 18 years old, and was assigned to the \"Junkerschule SS\". On 20 April 1936, he was commissioned an SS-\"Untersturmführer\" (second lieutenant) and thereafter promoted to the rank of SS-\"Obersturmführer\" (first lieutenant) on 11 September 1938. He was made the commander the \"Deutsches SS Standarten\" in Munich, Germany.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second World War, he had already reached the rank of SS-\"Hauptsturmführer\" (captain) and was given command of \"SS-Sturmbann Nº 13\", a unit of the \"SS Standarte Deutschland\". He was mobilized with his unit during the conquest of France and was wounded in combat in June 1940.\n\nAt the suggestion of Joachim Peiper, Grothmann was appointed second assistant to \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler until July 1942, when he was promoted to \"aide-de-camp\" to the leader of the SS. As Himmler's aide, Grothmann accompanied him on all field visits. In 1943 he was promoted to SS-\"Sturmbannführer\" (major) and then to SS-\"Obersturmbannführer\" (lieutenant colonel).\n\nDuring the last few days of the war in Europe, Himmler, Grothmann and Heinz Macher traveled from Lübeck to Flensburg, where Himmler offered his services as second-in-command to the new interim government led by Karl Dönitz, successor to Adolf Hitler. Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. Himmler was formally dismissed from all his posts.\n\nUnwanted by his former colleagues and hunted by the Allies, Himmler attempted to go into hiding. Himmler had not made extensive preparations for this, but he had equipped himself with a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger of the \"Geheime Feldpolizei\" (Secret Field Police), which was a mistake since members of this organization were sought after by the liberation forces. Grothmann and Macher were both dressed as army privates. Grothmann, Himmler, and Macher were stopped at a checkpoint, which had been set up by former Soviet POWs, on 21 May and detained. The three men were taken to an Allied barracks in Lüneburg on 23 May. During a routine interrogation, Himmler admitted who he was, and was then taken to the headquarters of the Second British Army. During an attempted medical examination, Himmler bit into a hidden cyanide pill and died. After Himmler's suicide, Grothmann and Macher were arrested.\n\nGrothmann was taken to a barracks at Lübeck, where he was extensively questioned. He denied any knowledge of Operation Reinhard. Then he was taken to an SS prison camp. Grothmann served as a prosecution witness against several SS officials between 1946 and 1948, but during the trial of Karl Wolff he denied having any knowledge of the Final Solution. \nAfter release from Allied internment, Grothmann was denazified, considered part of category III (Lesser Offenders), by a court in Freising in March 1949.\n\nGrothmann remade his life as a businessman and granted a few interviews in the 1970s in which he disparaged Himmler's character.
