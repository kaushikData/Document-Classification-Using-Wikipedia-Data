{"id": "32933085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32933085", "title": "Accounting networks and associations", "text": "Accounting networks and associations\n\nAccounting networks and associations are professional services networks whose principal purpose is to provide members resources to assist the clients around the world and hence reduce the uncertainty by bringing together a greater number of resources to work on a problem. The networks and associations operate independently of the independent members. The largest accounting networks are known as the Big Four.\nThe Big Four are the four largest international professional services networks, offering audit, assurance, tax, consulting, advisory, actuarial, corporate finance, and legal services. They handle the vast majority of audits for publicly traded companies as well as many private companies, creating an oligopoly in auditing large companies. It is reported that the Big Four audit 99% of the companies in the FTSE 100, and 96% of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index, an index of the leading mid-cap listing companies. The Big Four firms are shown below, with their latest publicly available data. None of the Big Four firms is a single firm; rather, they are professional services networks. Each is a network of firms, owned and managed independently, which have entered into agreements with other member firms in the network to share a common name, brand and quality standards. Each network has established an entity to co-ordinate the activities of the network. In one case (KPMG), the co-ordinating entity is Swiss, and in three cases (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young) the co-ordinating entity is a UK limited company. Those entities do not themselves perform external professional services, and do not own or control the member firms. They are similar to law firm networks found in the legal profession. In many cases each member firm practises in a single country, and is structured to comply with the regulatory environment in that country. In 2007 KPMG announced a merger of four member firms (in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) to form a single firm. Ernst & Young also includes separate legal entities which manage three of its four areas: Americas, EMEIA (Europe, The Middle East, India and Africa), and Asia-Pacific. (Note: the Japan area does not have a separate area management entity). These firms coordinate services performed by local firms within their respective areas but do not perform services or hold ownership in the local entities. This group was once known as the \"Big Eight\", and was reduced to the \"Big Six\" and then \"Big Five\" by a series of mergers. The Big Five became the Big Four after the demise of Arthur Andersen in 2002, following its involvement in the Enron scandal.\n\nAccounting networks were created to meet a specific need. “The accounting profession in the U.S. was built upon a state-established monopoly for audits of financial statements.” Accounting networks arose out of the necessity for public American companies to have audited financial statements for the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). For over 70 years, the SEC has continually sought for greater coordination and consistent quality in audits everywhere in the world. Networks were the logical model to address these requirements. They expanded outside of the United States since financial results had to be audited wherever a company conducted business. In the US, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's (PCAOB) regulations provide for inspection of non-United States firms. Without a network with common standards and internal means of communications, conducting the required audits would not be possible.\n\nThere were other profession-based factors which favored the growth of accounting networks. As a result of competition for the audit work, consolidation was inevitable. These include the fact that a network can establish a brand. A brand establishes the credibility of the network and allows the individual members to charge more. Creating a brand is very difficult when all of the members of a network are providing essentially the same services.\n\nBeing a network member establishes that the firm is part of a large group. Additionally, the larger the firm, the more likely it will be invited to render auditing engagements. A large organized network allows for spreading the costs to price competitively. Ultimately, size is the only real means of differentiation that is readily available on accounting firms to assure clients that they can do international work.\n\nNetworks also reflect the clients’ needs for seamless worldwide services because they are more efficient and cost-effective., From the perspective of the accounting firm, a global regulated organization with consistently applied standards significantly reduced the risk. However, increasing the size of the networks can enhance legal liability risks and quality control issues that have not been resolved.\n\nWith these factors in play, some networks continued to grow; others remained in a stasis position. Individual members of networks began to offer other services related to accounting. These services included forensic accounting, business appraisals, employee benefits planning, strategic planning, and almost anything associated with financial parts of the client’s business. The network’s structure easily accommodated these services and their geographical expansion.\n\nAs the Big 8 consolidated to become Big 6, the Big 5 and then the Big 4, new networks naturally developed to emulate them. BDO and Grant Thornton were the earliest followers. Networks were then developed to serve mid-market companies and private businesses. New networks also sprang up as an extension of a single accounting firm in the same way the Big 8 were formed. New structures were created to further extend the networks.\n\nThe largest accounting networks adopted trade names that each member used. The names of the original firms that became part of the networks were lost and replaced with trade names. For example, PriceWaterhouseCoopers became PWC. The perception was created that these networks were more than networks, but single entities rather than completely independent firms. This was never the case. The result was that the Big 8 concept was established which separated the eight firms from all other accounting firms.\n\nAnother factor in the development of networks in accounting was the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants(AICPA)’s prohibition of advertising. While the largest firms indirectly advertised their services, the small firms complied with the rules and believed advertising to be unprofessional. Additionally, midsize firms were de facto restricted from advertising simply because of limited budgets. They could not create a brand that was able to compete with the one established by the Big 8. The advertising restriction was lifted in the 1970s by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIn the 1990s, the large accounting firms reached another ceiling in the services they made available to their clients. Having reached their natural limit on growth with more than 90% of auditing for public companies, the Big 6 branched out to become multidisciplinary in legal, technology, and employment services. Since the essential infrastructure was in place, it was thought to be relatively simple to incorporate other services into the existing network. As a network, it was natural to create independent entities in these other professions which themselves could be part of the network. The method and structures varied from firm to firm.\n\nWhen the Big 6 began its expansion to the legal profession, it was met with fierce opposition from law firms and bar associations. Commissions, panels and committees were established by legal and accounting firms to argue their positions. Government agencies were enlisted. For more than five years the debate escalated. This movement ended abruptly with the fall of Arthur Andersen as a result of its association with Enron. Sarbanes Oxley followed, which effectively ended this trend. Some international associations of independent firms, such as Alliott Group, now include law firms within the membership.\n\nHere are the top 10 global accounting firms in 2017, according to research conducted by \"CA magazine.\"\n\nAccounting networks are now facing a new challenge that go to the heart of the image that the firms wish to project to clients. The perception has been that the Big 4, Grant Thornton and BDO are single entities that perform services around the world for clients of this single entity. As a result of court cases this has introduced significant vicarious liability issues requiring the networks to distance themselves from the perception of being a single entity. The Parmalat case is the best illustration of the issues.\n\nWhile the firms have lost a number of cases, the facts and circumstance, or procedural elements have reduced their actual liability.\n\nThe vicarious liability issues carry over into operations. Regulations in the EU have been imposed that require the “networks” to define whether they are \"associations\" of independent firm or are more integrated networks operationally and financially. Additional standards have been passed by IFAC, an independent associations of accountants, on distinguishing networks from associations. The objectives of each are to provide the clients a level of understanding about the degree of integration with each other. Examples of international associations of accounting firms include Alliott Group, Geneva Group International and Leading Edge Alliance.\n\nSelf-definition as a network or associations may determine if there is a conflict of interest. If the group is perceived as a network, it may be foreclosed from representation of clients because they cannot represent a competitor. Association members would not be foreclosed from representation because the firms are perceived as independent by clients.\n\nAccounting scandals have again focused on the fact that the Big 4 has a near monopoly on audits of public companies. Networks are demanding regulations on auditing to require that auditors rotate and include the smaller networks in this rotation. The demands also request that mid-market firms be able to participate to break up the monopoly of the Big 4.\n\n\n"}

Those awards were restricted to writers from Australia and New Zealand. For more on those awards in 2010, see: \"Australian Aviation’s McLaughlin ‘Aviation Journalist of the Year’\", on australianaviation.com.au December 6, 2010.\n\nThe international Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards (abbreviated \"AJOYA\") were awards for writers and broadcasters working in the aerospace and aviation field, including specialists and those working for non-specialist titles. The awards dinner took place in mid-July (timed to coincide with the Farnborough Air Show and the Paris Air Show), and brought together aviation media and industry representatives.\n\nThe awards were organised between 1996 and 2010 by Malcolm Turner and his company (the \"World Leadership Forum, Ltd,\" of the UK) under the auspices of the Royal Aeronautical Society of the U.K. and the Aero Club of France (Aéro-Club de France).\n\nThe Awards, given annually, were typically organized in a hierarchy:\n...which judges narrowed down to...\n...from which, based on judges' scores, were selected...\n...from which were selected, based on judges' scores...\n...and an additional award...\n\nThe AJOYA awards were originally trophies in the form of a bronze eagle - leading the awards to become known colloquially as 'budgies', and for the competition to become known as the 'Budgie Awards'. The design of the Trophy changed several times, becoming a representation of the Aerospace Journalist of the Year logo, and then a simple engraved glass 'spike'.\n\nThe aerospace industry's writing awards, previously for many years (1960s to mid/late-1990s), had been awarded annually by the U.S.-based Aviation & Space Writers' Association, at a grand banquet gathering aviation industry leaders and luminaries. That organization and its awards program dissolved, leaving a vacuum in the aviation media world.\n\nStarting in the late 1990s, until 2009-2010, that void was filled by a British enterprise—the World Leadership Forum, Ltd. -- in collaboration with the world's two oldest aviation organizations: the Aero Club of France (Aéro-Club de France), and the Royal Aeronautical Society (of the United Kingdom).\n\nAwards were issued in several \"Category\" topic areas (see lists below).\n\nContest entries (copies of published articles or broadcasts) were received from publications and authors, then copied and redistributed to judges in each category, who then narrowed the submissions down to a few finalists (the prestigious \"Shortlist\") in each category, which was then published on the organization website during the months leading up to the Banquet.\n\nThe \"Shortlist\" candidates were invited to the Awards Banquet, where they would then discover who, among them, would be awarded the \"Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award\" in that respective category. Then from the category winners, a tally of judges' scores determined the one overall \"Aerospace Journalist of the Year,\" and one Honoree for a \"Decade of Excellence\" Award.\n\nThe awards were first presented in London in 1996, and throughout the years, the presentation ceremonies have alternated between Paris and London—roughly coinciding with the world's two main airshows: the Paris Air Show and Farnborough Air Show (England), held on alternate years.\n\nIn London, the AJOYA ceremonies have taken place at the Ballroom of the Park Lane Hotel, Piccadilly, and at the Royal Courts of Justice and they directly preceded the biennial Farnborough Airshow.\n\nThe organization depended upon aerospace industry companies to sponsor the awards, and reciprocated their generosity by offering them seating with the AJOYA finalists at the awards banquet—a public-relations opportunity for aerospace industry leaders and P.R. execs to charm their industry's leading writers and opinion-shapers.\n\nHowever, remotely located from most of the world's aviation media (in London or Paris, far removed from the Americas, Africa and Asia), many aerospace writers who made the awards-finalist \"Shortlists\" (and were thus invited to the banquet), were unable to attend—undermining the value of the banquet, and sponsorships, to AJOYA's commercial sponsors.\n\nThe awards then began to be limited to only those writers who would make the trip to the banquet, sharply reducing eligibility for the awards.\n\nInitially, relatively few of the world's aerospace journalists competed, and the awards were almost exclusively from the U.S. and Britain, with a few contestants from Western Europe and British Commonwealth nations.\n\nBut as the years went by, many more entered the contests, and additional categories of judging were added, and non-English entries were admitted (and translated into English for the judges), drawing contest entries from throughout the world—Russia and Eastern Europe, China and East Asia, South Asia, Latin America and Africa.\n\nThe volume of entries began to overwhelm the limited number of AJOYA judges, creating difficuties.\n\nThe global economic \"Great Recession\" that started in 2007 soon collapsed the aerospace industry, and forced drastic budget-tightening on nearly all aerospace companies. \"Extras\"—such as support of aviation organizations and programs—were cut out of many companies' budgets.\n\nThe awards ended amid rumours that they folded due to a lack of sponsorship.\n\nThe World Leadership Forum, Ltd. organization dissolved in 2009, according to the business-info website Duedil.com.\n\nThe AJOYA.com website is now off-line and the domain name is for sale.\n\nThere were no awards in 2011, and in 2012 a different organiser held a new Aerospace Media Awards dinner at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London.\n\nJudges were chiefly leading aerospace industry editors & writers, and business/technical leaders & experts—largely chosen from the ranks of former AJOYA Winners or \"Shortlist\" finalists—from around the world.\n\nThe judges came from aerospace industry publications such as:\n\nTo ensure fair judging, judges were recused from voting on their own submissions, and from voting on any other submissions from any publication for whom they wrote, or any \"sister\" publication (owned by the same, or a related, company).\n\nThe final list of AJOYA judges (see below) finished with the note:\n\"The judges have not marked any entry from their own publication/company, or any sister publication/company\"\n\nThis is the last list of Judges, which remained on the AJOYA.COM website until 2010:\n\n2009 Judges:\n\nThe categories for the awards include:\n\nWinners are grouped below into:\n\nTHE DECADE OF EXCELLENCE Award\n\nTHE AEROSPACE JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR:\n\nThe CATEGORY WINNERS in each category,\nfor each year were:\n\nBEST AIR SHOW SUBMISSION\nBEST AIR SHOW DAILY\nBEST AIR TRANSPORT SUBMISSION\nBEST AVIONICS SUBMISSION\nBEST BREAKING NEWS SUBMISSION\nBEST BUSINESS AIRCRAFT SUBMISSION\nBEST BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL SUBMISSION\nBEST DEFENCE SUBMISSION\nBEST ENVIRONMENT SUBMISSION\nBEST GENERAL AVIATION SUBMISSION\nBEST MAINTENANCE SUBMISSION\nBEST PROPULSION SUBMISSION\nBEST REGIONAL AIRCRAFT SUBMISSION\nBEST SAFETY SUBMISSION\nBEST SPACE SUBMISSION\nBEST SYSTEMS OR TECHNOLOGY SUBMISSION\n\n"}

The Evenk Autonomous Okrug was later merged into the Krasnoyarsk Krai on January 1, 2007, and incorporated into the Krasnoyarsk Krai as the Evenkiysky District.\n\nBokovikov was elected as the first chairman of the Evenk Autonomous Okrug legislature, known as the Sulgan, in 1994.\n\nBokovikov announced his candidacy for Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug in the 1996 gubernatorial election. He ran with the backing of both the National Patriotic Union of Russia and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Bokovikov's main opponent was the incumbent head of the Evenk Autonomous Okrug, Anatolii Yakimov, who was supported by the All Russia Coordinating Council.\n\nThe gubernatorial election was held on December 22, 1996, but it would be March 1997 before a victor was announced due to irregularities in the election results. The initial election results showed Bokovikov defeating Yakimov by less than 100 votes. However, the final vote tally had Yakimov being re-elected by 550 votes over Bokovikov. Bokovikov filed a lawsuit against the Evenk Autonomous Okrug's election commission, with the goal of having the 1996 election results overturned. The results were not overturned, but a new gubernatorial election was held in March 1997 instead.\n\nAleksandr Bokovikov was elected Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug on March 16, 1997, nearly four months after the disputed December election.\n\nMuch of his focus as Governor pertained to economic development in the okrug and raising the standard of living. He also opposed the sale of public land.\n\nBokovikov actively supported the Evenk Autonomous Okrug remaining a constituent part of the Krasnoyarsk Krai. Bokovikov signed a June 1997 treaty with then Krasnoyarsk Krai Governor Valerii Zubov which explicitly stated that Evenk Autonomous Okrug was part of Krasnoyarsk Krai. The agreement also allowed residents of Evenk Autonomous Okrug to vote in Krasnoyarsk Krai's gubernatorial and legislative elections.\n\nBokovikov remained Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug until 2001. He was succeeded by Boris Zolotaryov, the last Governor of Evenk Autonomous Okrug before the okrug was abolished and incorporated into Krasnoyarsk Krai on January 1, 2010.\n\nBokovikov became the director of the Evenkiyanefteprodukt company after leaving office. He was elected to the Council of deputies in Tura, Evenkiysky District.\n\nAleksandr Bokovikov died on August 8, 2010, at the age of 53.\n"}

In 1992, when the country experienced growth in paid-subscription media, the Parliament of Australia enacted the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 that gave free-to-air broadcasters essentially first refusal to certain sporting event broadcasting rights. The anti-siphoning list is a list of events, the televising of which should, in the opinion of the relevant Minister, be available free to the general public. To effect this 'freedom', the \"Broadcasting Services Act 1992\" includes a licence condition on pay TV providers that prohibits them from acquiring anti-siphoning events unless a national broadcaster or a network of commercial television broadcasters have the right to televise the events. This prohibition drops away a certain period before the event starts. The current anti-siphoning rules also prohibit national television broadcasters and commercial television broadcasters from premiering listed events on digital multi-channels. Listed events may be shown on digital multi-channels if they have already been broadcast, or are simultaneously broadcast on the broadcaster's main channel.\nThe anti-siphoning list came into effect in 2006. The relevant Minister has the power to add, amend or remove events from the list. Currently, only sporting events are listed, even though the \"Broadcasting Services Act 1992\" does not limit the types of events that can be listed. There are currently ten sport types (e.g. tennis, soccer, rugby league) on the anti-siphoning list plus the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. Events on the anti-siphoning list are delisted 12 weeks before they start to ensure pay TV broadcasters have reasonable access to listed events, if free-to-air broadcasters decide not to purchase the broadcast rights for a particular event. Any rights to listed sporting events that are not acquired by free-to-air broadcasters are available to pay TV. Before the end of 2009, the Federal Government conducted a review of the anti-siphoning scheme, with the Minister proposing changes to the scheme.\nThese changes can not come into effect until amending legislation is passed through the Australian Parliament.\nAfter the broadcasting deals were announced with Cricket Australia, Seven Network and Fox Cricket, Men’s ODIs and T20s will be live and exclusively broadcast on Foxtel.\n\nThe most accurate and up to date anti-siphoning list is available on the comlaw website \nGenerally, the following events are anti-siphoning events:\n\nSporting events are added and removed from the list from time to time.

It was designed by the noted local firm of Walker and Weeks for the W. Bingham Company, and is one of the architectural firm's few utilitarian commercial buildings. For many years, W. Bingham Co. was the Midwest's largest hardware manufacturer and wholesaler. The W. Bingham Co. went out of business in 1961, and the warehouse was sold to a succession of owners of the years. The warehouse was sold to private investors in 2001, who converted it into apartments, known today as The Bingham.\n\nCleveland entrepreneurs William Bingham and Henry C. Blossom purchased the Clark & Murfey hardware store in 1841, and incorporated it as the W. Bingham Co. in 1888.\n\nIn April 1913, the W. Bingham Co. announced it would construct a new building in the city's Warehouse District as its new headquarters. Intended to be the largest warehouse in Cleveland, \n\nBy June 1914, work on the architectural plans had advanced to the point where W. Bingham Co. was ready to place an order for up to of structural steel and rebar. But city officials had extensive concerns about the architectural design, and extensive (if unreported) changes to the plans were under way in July 1914. At the end of July, W. Bingham Co. awarded the contract for the general contractor's job to the Cleveland construction firm Crowell-Lundoff-Little. Although the city was still withholding final approval for the architectural plans and building permit, enough of the design had won approval for the contractor to advise steel companies that it was interested in purchasing about of shaped steel. Although the design controversy continued, the McClintic-Marshall Corp. received the contract for of shaped steel in early August 1914, the Ayer & Lord Tie Co. of Chicago won the contract for of flooring and Carnegie Steel received the contract for of rebar in reinforcing bars in late August.\n\nFinal approval of the architectural plans must have been close by the beginning of August 1914, because excavation at the site began. Plans now showed 10 above-ground floors (each of reinforced concrete) and three basement levels. At a total estimated cost of land and construction at $1 million ($ in dollars), it was reportedly the largest warehouse in the United States. The Fred R. Jones Company did the excavation work. The work was extremely difficult. The excavation site was , a large existing building abutted the southwest side of the site, and there was a very steep change in grade from the northeast to southwest. A steam shovel was used to remove the of earth, and steel sheet pilings were rammed into the soil to prevent cave-ins along the sides. These pilings were left in place to support the combined slab and pier foundation and freestanding retaining wall. Both the Big Four and the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (the \"Nickel Plate\") ran a joint spur onto the site, then hauled the earth several miles to Kingsbury Run (where it was used as landfill). Excavation was complete in mid-October.\n\nThe city issued a permit for construction of the foundation about the time the excavation was complete. The foundation used a combination of piers, slab, footings, and retaining walls. The total cost of the foundation was originally estimated to be about $50,000 ($ in dollars). Soil tests revealed a hard bluish clay about below the surface, and the piers rested on this clay. Cantilevered retaining walls with buttresses were built to hold back the surrounding earth, and two-way reinforced spread footings poured to support the walls. The William Edwards Co. building on the southwest side of the new warehouse left insufficient space for regular footings and a buttressed retaining wall to be used. Instead, Lackawanna sheet pilings were used to reinforce the wall, and two separate footings were built. As construction of the foundation proceeded, numerous pockets of quicksand were found in the soil. Further investigation revealed that pockets of quicksand lay beneath almost all the footings on the building's northeast side. A test pit was dug, and soil engineers discovered a solid clay further down. Light sheet pilings were used to create caissons. These were excavated, and the footings carried down to the firm clay.\n\nThe city issued a building permit in late February or early March 1915. Work on the basement floors and walls proceeded very slowly. Enormous coal and ash bins and long steel rails for the moving of heavy items were designed to hang from ceiling beams in these areas. This required the use of shaped steel pieces which had to be perfectly joined, and the pouring of concrete around them. Once the basements were complete, the rest of the building rose very swiftly. Upper floors were poured at a rate of three floors a day, and the exterior brick walls rose at the rate of one floor every two days.\n\nThe W. Bingham Co. warehouse opened for business in February or March of 1916.\n\nThe W. Bingham Co. warehouse building cost $600,000 ($ in dollars). It is largely constructed of brick, concrete, and steel. The slightly L-shaped building was wide on W. 9th Street and wide on W. 10th Street and had a total length of ( between the basement walls). On W. 9th Street, eight floors were visible and the building height was . On W. 10th Street, 11 floors were visible and the building height was . Each floor had of space, for a total building interior space of .\n\nAs viewed from W. 9th Street, the building had three basements. The rear (or southwest) wall of the third basement was actually a heavily reinforced slab and pier retaining wall high, giving the third basement a ceiling high. The third basement extended about under W. 9th Street, while the second and first basements only extended about under the street. There were originally only two large shipping doors, each roughly wide and high, in the rear wall of the third basement. To accommodate the doors, two exterior columns had to be omitted. In their place are two massive girders, each long and resting on a single massive pier between the doors. A railroad spur ran under the building's ell (along the line of the old Mandrake Avenue), and there were 24 truck loading docks on the structure's northwest side.\n\nThe superstructure of the building featured unusually heavy columns and floor slabs designed to permit on the floors of the first and second basement and the first and second floor, and on floors three and higher. In order to accommodate the weight of the boiler, coal bin, ash bin, and associated equipment at the rear of the second basement, a portion of this floor was designed to withstand . The octagonal, steel core-and-concrete columns in this area were tall, extending from the foundation up to the second floor. Four of the exterior wall columns as well as all interior columns in the three basements and first floor were also steel core-and-concrete, to support the stresses on the structure below-ground. Above the second floor, all columns were reinforced concrete. The bases of all the columns consisted of cast iron-and-two-way reinforced concrete. All column caps were reinforced with shelf angles attached to the flanges and core reinforcement plates, and all columns were topped with octagonal plates reinforced with stiffeners. Above the second floor, all column tops were flared to help support the floor slab above. Due to complications created by the William Edwards building next to it, there were fewer exterior and interior columns in the structure's southwest corner. Instead, cantilevers supported the exterior walls above the third floor.\n\nThe floors of the basements and upper floors were poured in slabs. These slabs were thick in the basements and on the first floor, and thick on all other floors. The roof was a slab. Spandrel beams were not used in the flooring system. The exception was on the fourth floor: With offices to be located on the third floor, the architects wanted to do away with column caps in order to provide space for lighting fixtures and to avoid light-scattering. Spandrels in the fourth floor were needed to compensate for the weaker support. Flooring throughout the structure was Kreolite, a creosote-impregnated wood block.\n\nThe exterior of the building was clad in paving brick rejects. Walker & Weeks had used uniformly-colored paving brick on the Renkert Building, which it had designed shortly before beginning work on the W. Bingham Co. warehouse. Architect Harry Weeks recommended paving brick for the Bingham building because it was strong, long-wearing, and inexpensive. \"Seconds\" (bricks which were not uniform in color due to chemical differences, miscasting, or after spending too much time curing in the kiln) were recommended by Weeks because they created an aesthetically pleasing \"tapestry effect which might be assumed to have resulted from careful artistic design, rather than accident and economy.\" Windows in the building all had steel sashes and wire mesh glass. The roofline was a simple concave cavetto cornice.\n\nThe interior of the building, as befit a warehouse, was relatively spartan. Five elevators were grouped in the center of the structure, and a pneumatic tube network installed in the shafts as a space-saving measure. The building also featured several spiral package chutes, and an exterior surface parking lot.\n\nThe cost of the land and completed building was $1 million ($ in dollars). All told, of cast iron, of structural steel, of rebar, and of concrete were used in its construction. When completed, it was reportedly the largest single-unit warehouse in the world.\n\nThe W. Bingham Co. warehouse building is widely considered one of the finest Commercial style buildings in Cleveland. It features extremely high-quality construction and design, which is unusual for a utilitarian building. It is also, according to the \"Ohio Historic Places Dictionary\", an early example of \"vertical rectangular construction of a building in a manner clearly appropriate to its function.\"\n\nThe structure is widely celebrated for the inspired use of paving brick seconds, which adds color and texture to the building. The exterior is considered unusually sophisticated, with \"subtle refinements of proportion and detail\". It has also won praise for the simple, repetitive piers that bring it to life.\n\nWith the completion of the warehouse, the W. Bingham Co. shifted from retail to wholesale-only operations. Over the years, changes to the interior reduced the available space to just .\n\nW. Bingham Co. ceased operations in June 1961. Several executives with the company purchased the corporate indicia, inventory, and equipment and formed a new company, Bingham, Inc. The new firm continued to sell Bingham products to manufacturing, mining, and railroad customers. W. Bingham Co. continued to own the warehouse, and leased space in it to various kinds of firms (including Bingham Inc.)\n\nSome time on or before 1971, the Bingham building was purchased by the Ostendorf-Morris Co., a local real estate investment company.\n\nIn November 1973, the W. Bingham Co. warehouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nHaving been purchased by outside investors in 1970 and by Formweld Products Co. in 1973, Bingham Co. moved out of the building in 1980.\n\nDuring the W. Bingham Co. warehouse's first half century, Cleveland and the Warehouse District went into significant decline. The rapid and significant expansion in heavy industry in Cleveland ended about 1930, and contracted dramatically after 1950. As the century neared its close, only chemical, instrument and medical equipment, and plastics manufacturing remained as major employers. The city's population reached a high of 914,808 in 1950, but dropped to under 400,000 at the turn of the century (and continued to decline). In the Warehouse District, 115 of the 175 buildings, representing more than half the area, were demolished. The number of residents living in the area had dropped from a high of 12,068 in 1950 to a low of 3,844 in 1970 (although they had recovered slightly to 4,651 in 1990). \n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the W. Bingham Co. warehouse was relatively unused. A few small city and county agencies and offices had leased space on the structure's ground floor, while the remainder of the building was used for storage or was empty. Although the building had never been renovated in the past 85 years, it was in good condition. It was also the largest building in the Warehouse District which had yet to undergo demolition or redevelopment.\n\nIn February 2000, Bingham Burnside LLC, a company established by owners and executives of the Burnside Construction Co. of Chicago, initiated a process to purchase the Bingham building for an undisclosed sum.\n\nBingham Burnside sought to redevelop the structure into a mixed-use development. The company planned spending $66.7 million ($ in dollars) on converting of space into 339 apartments, of space into a 340-vehicle parking garage, and of space into ground-floor retail. Bingham Burnside hired Marous Brothers Construction as the general contractor overseeing the project, which it hoped to begin on April 1, 2001. To pay for the conversion, Bingham Burnside received a $2 million ($ in dollars) loan from the city of Cleveland, $7.4 million ($ in dollars) in historic preservation tax credits from the state; and a $7.8 million ($ in dollars) conservation easement from the state. The city also agreed to give the developers a 75 percent tax abatement for the project's first five years, a 50 percent tax abatement for its next five years, and a 25 percent tax abatement in its 11th and 12th years.\n\nRelocation of tenants was nearly complete by early June 2002, somewhat behind schedule. By then, the cost of converting the building had risen to $70 million ($ in dollars). The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded Bingham Burnside a $41.8 million ($ in dollars) conversion loan. The Bingham became the largest HUD-financed project in Ohio to date. The loan allowed construction on the project to begin in the fall of 2002, with construction expected to be completed in summer 2003.\n\nUnanticipated construction delays meant that the Bingham apartments did not open until May 2004. The final cost of the conversion was $80 million ($ in dollars).\n\nIn late 2004, Constantino's Market opened in of space on the ground floor of the Burnham on W. 9th Street. The space, a former showroom for W. Bingham Co. hardware goods, was restored and conserved. Although the space was broken up by several columns, these were reutilized as display shelves. Constantino's received a $380,000 ($ in dollars) below-market loan from the city to help pay for the space's renovation.\n\nThe conversion of the warehouse won two awards. The first was the Downtown Development Award, given by the Downtown Cleveland Partnership in March 2005 to Bingham Burnside . The second Award for Excellence in Renovation (Other Buildings), given by the Northern Ohio Chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties to Marous Brothers Construction in May 2005.\n\nBurnside Construction suffered severe economic losses during the Great Recession of 2008-2010, and in May 2007 filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (liquidation). Although The Bingham apartment building was 80 percent full and Constantino's was expanding its space on the ground floor, Bingham Burnside LLC was unable to make its loan payments without the support of its parent company. HUD seized the mortgage and title to the building, and actioned off the mortgage. Resource Real Estate bought the loan for $25 million in March 2010, and successfully completed a foreclosure proceeding against Bingham Burnside. Resource Real Estate won court approval to sell The Bingham in July 2010 in order to satisfy the mortgage.\n\nResource Real Estate won the November 1, 2010, auction for The Bingham. The company said it planned no major changes at the complex, but would make cosmetic improvements to the common areas.\n\n"}

{"id": "41520725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41520725", "title": "Gatwick Diamond", "text": "Gatwick Diamond\n\nThe Gatwick Diamond is a name invented as a brand for a loosely defined economic area that surrounds Gatwick Airport, some 30 miles south of London.\n\nThe area stretches from the edge of London and the North Downs in the north to the edge of Brighton and the South Downs in the south, and from Horsham in the west to East Grinstead in the east. It benefits from two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: the Surrey Hills and the South Downs National Park. It has an area of some 400 square miles and a population of 680,000; its economy generates £20.7bn GDP. 12 million people live within one hour's drive. There are 406,000 economically active people in the Gatwick Diamond; 81% of the working age population is economically active. 74% of Gatwick Diamond workers are residents (annual population survey 2011). The unemployment level is very low at 1.4%. The Gatwick Diamond is home to 45,000 businesses including many UK and European Headquarters. Some of these companies are: Unilever, Exxon Mobil, Toyota, Doosan, Thales Group, Varian Medical Systems, Elekta, Nestle, EDF Energy, Edwards Vacuum, Canon Inc. and G4S. It also contains the Manor Royal Business Park – the largest business park in the UK, housing 550 businesses and employing around 35,000 people.\n\nThe Gatwick Diamond Initiative is a business-led private/public partnership that was established in April 2003 to improve the economic performance of the area. It now includes seven local borough/district councils (Horsham, Crawley, Mid Sussex, Tandridge, Reigate & Banstead, Mole Valley and Epsom & Ewell) and two county councils (West Sussex and Surrey), as well as a range of private sector partners.\n\nOne of its first actions was to arrange a meeting of the principal stakeholders (both public and private sector) to determine what actions could be taken to improve the economic performance of the area. Business leaders considered that the first priority should be to give the area an image and identity. The Initiative therefore launched the \"Gatwick Diamond\" on 15 July 2004. Since then the term \"Gatwick Diamond\" has achieved widespread recognition and acceptance. It was first referred to in parliament by Nicholas Soames, MP for Mid Sussex, on 13 Jun 2006. The Gatwick Diamond Initiative lobbies government and the public sector on issues that prevent businesses in the area from growing; they encourage international trade; promote, attract and help UK and foreign inward investors looking to locate in the area; campaign on issues such as Air Passenger Duty, Gatwick's second runway and the Gatwick Express; and encourage the three Further Education colleges at Redhill, Crawley and Epsom to work together with the University of Brighton and University for the Creative Arts to provide Higher and Further Education to meet business needs.\n\nThe Gatwick Diamond area is situated directly south of London and covers the east of Surrey and northwest of Sussex. The heart of the area is 30 miles from Central London. By rail, the Gatwick Express can get to Central London in 30 minutes. Gatwick Airport is situated at the centre of the Gatwick Diamond and is a nominal 1 hour's drive from Heathrow Airport, subject to frequent delays on the M25. The Gatwick Diamond is within 1 hour from the sea ports of Shoreham and Newhaven and 90 minutes from Dover, Southampton and Portsmouth sea ports. By road, the M23 bisects the Gatwick Diamond and is just 10 minutes from the M25. By bus, the Metrobus Fastway service takes many employees in the Gatwick Diamond to their workplace; coaches leave Gatwick to reach 400 UK towns and cities. The Gatwick Diamond is an economic area worth £20.7bn GDP (growing at 3% per year), with a population of 680,000.\n\nGatwick Airport has 48 airlines which fly to 200 destinations, more than any other UK airport. The airport connects to 45 out of 50 top European destinations and over half of the world’s emerging markets. In 2014, the airport had 38.6 million passengers pass through it. This contributes towards Gatwick being the busiest single-runway airport in the world. The airport's railway station was used by 18 million passengers in 2015-16, making it the busiest airport station in the UK.\n\nThe Gatwick Diamond Business Association (until 2012, the Crawley and District Industry Association) offers networking opportunities at its monthly members' meetings. It operates like the other membership organisations in the area such as the Chambers of Commerce, Sussex Enterprise and Surrey Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses, but concentrates on the Gatwick Diamond area. It also delivers the Gatwick Diamond Business Awards.\n\n"}

Lunger (1905–1976) who worked at All American Aviation Company, a company founded by Richard du Pont and based in Wilmington, Delaware. During 1936-1937 the Lungers built \"Oberod,\" a stone mansion on rural acreage at 400 Burnt Mill Road in the Brandywine River Valley about 8 miles from downtown Wilmington, Delaware.

He was a prominent brewer and Resident Magistrate in Nelson and his sixth generation descendants still operate a brewery in the city.\n\nDodson was originally from England. He arrived in Nelson on 16 May 1854 from Melbourne in Australia on the brig \"Return\" (via Wellington). Within days, he bought a share of a Nelson brewery. Soon afterwards, he returned to Melbourne to sort out his business affairs. He returned with his wife and four children on the \"Marchioness\", arriving on 27 September 1854.\n\nAfter his first arrival from Melbourne, Dodson bought the shares of the late Dr Renwick in the Hooper & Co brewery. In 1855, he established the Raglan Brewery and leased Charles Harley's Bridge Street Brewery. In 1860, he sold his brewery shares and went back to England with his family for six years. On his return to Nelson, he brought farming equipment with him and established himself as a reseller of these goods. Once he was established, he took up a shareholding in Hooper & Co again.\n\nIn 1884, Dodson suffered a significant loss with the death of his business partner of 30 years, George Hooper. Dodson took over Hooper's shareholding, and the name of the brewery changed to \"J. R. Dodson & Son\". His son Henry had joined the business in 1879. Henry Duncan joined them in 1888; he was the son of Joseph Dodson's daughter Mary-Ann.\n\nDescendants of Henry Duncan have continued brewing. His great-grandchildren Matt Duncan and Callum Duncan now operate a boutique brewery of international acclaim. Founders Brewery, established in 1999, was the first fully certified organic brewery in the southern hemisphere. They have twice won the award of \"Champion Small Brewery\" at the Australian International Beer Awards.\n\nDodson was former member of the Board of Works. He was elected a Councillor, possibly in 1874, and elected by his fellow Councillors as Mayor at a Council meeting on 1 May 1874. He was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1874.\n\nDodson did not receive a salary as Mayor although he entertained visiting dignitaries at his own expense, such as the Governor Sir James Fergusson on behalf of the city. This provoked some debate in the local papers about the behaviour of the Provincial Superintendent in comparison.\n\nDuring his term negotiations began with the local Gas Works, a Provincial Government owned facility, for gas lighting for the city. In September 1874 the Council sought to employ the first town clerk and rate collector.\n\nOn 16 December 1874 Dodson was reconfirmed as Mayor for 1875. The council was in conflict with the provincial government over finances. Nelson went bankrupt, the mayor resigned on 8 January 1875, and so did most of the councillors. A special meeting of the remaining Councillors was held on 12 January 1875 to appoint a new Mayor but no one was forthcoming. A public meeting was held on the Friday to determine the wishes of the ratepayers. In mid February, seven people stood for Council and since that was the number of vacancies, they were declared elected. At a council meeting on 26 February, a new mayor was elected and Joseph Levien accepted the position.\n\nDodson served a second period as mayor, from 16 December 1877 until he retired on 22 November 1881. This was described as a 'happier term'. The city hosted another Governor during this term, The Lord Rosmead. Also during his term, Dodson and the Council lobbied Government to extend the existing railway and link it to the main line at Blenheim. When Dodson retired as Mayor, Edward Everett was elected in his place.\n\nDodson died on 12 October 1890 in Nelson, aged 78 years. He was buried at Wakapuaka Cemetery on 14 October.\n"}

Foreign employees were brought in and local employees were shipped out as Lee tried to foster a more international attitude to doing business.\n\nUnder Lee's guidance, the company has been transformed from a Korean budget name into a major international force and arguably the most prominent Asian brand worldwide. One of the group's subsidiaries, Samsung Electronics, is now one of the world's leading developers and producers of semiconductors, and was listed in Fortune magazine's list of the 100 largest corporations in the world in 2007. Today Samsung's revenues are now 39 times what they were in 1987, it generates around 20 percent of South Korea's GDP, and Lee is the country's richest man.\n\nOn April 21, 2008, he resigned and stated: \"We, including myself, have caused troubles to the nation with the special probe; I deeply apologize for that, and I'll take full responsibility for everything, both legally and morally.\" On December 29, 2009, the South Korean government moved to pardon Lee Kun-hee.\n\nOn March 24, 2010, he announced his return to Samsung Electronics as its chairman.\n\nIn an interview, Lee expressed pride in the fact that Samsung attracts the brightest minds in South Korea but added that his new goal is to attract talent from all over the world to ensure that Samsung will remain one of the top companies in the world for years.\n\nNotable Samsung industrial subsidiaries include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information technology company measured by 2011 revenues), Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues), Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T (respectively the world's 35th- and 72nd-largest construction companies),Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. Ltd. (Established in 1973, Samsung Electro-Mechanics has become a remarkable developer and manufacturer of key electronic components not only in Korea but also in other parts of the world) and Samsung Techwin (a weapons technology and optoelectronics manufacturer). Other notable subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th-largest life insurance company), Samsung Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea) and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 19th-largest advertising agency measured by 2010 revenues).\n\nSamsung produces around a fifth of South Korea's total exports and its revenues are larger than many countries' GDP; in 2006, it would have been the world's 35th-largest economy. The company has a powerful influence on South Korea's economic development, politics, media and culture and has been a major driving force behind the \"Miracle on the Han River\".\n\nOn January 14, 2008, Korean police raided Lee's home and office in an ongoing probe into accusations that Samsung was responsible for a slush fund used to bribe influential prosecutors, judges, and political figures in South Korea. On April 4, 2008, Lee denied allegations against him in the scandal. After a second round of questioning by the South Korean prosecutors, on April 11, 2008, Lee was quoted by reporters as saying, \"I am responsible for everything. I will assume full moral and legal responsibility.” On July 16, 2008, \"The New York Times\" reported the Seoul Central District Court had found Lee guilty on charges of financial wrongdoing and tax evasion. Prosecutors requested Lee be sentenced to seven years in prison and fined 350 billion won (approx $312 million USD). The court fined him 110 billion won (approx $98 million USD) and sentenced him to three years' suspended jail time. Lee has not responded to the verdict. Months later, South Korean president Lee Myung-bak pardoned Lee so he could remain on the International Olympic Committee.\n\nIn 2010, the company's former chief legal counsel, Kim Yong-chul, published a book called \"Think Samsung\". It revealed shocking alleged details of Lee Kun-hee's personal corruption, claiming he stole up to 10 trillion won (approx $8.9 billion USD) from Samsung subsidiaries, destroyed evidence, and bribed government officials to ensure the smooth transfer of power to his son.\n\nLee Kun-hee's wife, Hong Ra-hee, is the daughter of Hong Jin-ki, the former chairman of the JoongAng Ilbo and Tongyang Broadcasting Company, and Kim Yoon-nam. Kim was born in the coastal city of Mokpo, South Jeolla. While attending Ewha Womans University as a junior in 1943, she married Hong Jin-ki (1917–86), who at the time was working as a judge at the Jeonju District Court in Jeonju, North Jeolla. The two are survived by four sons and two daughters: Ra-hee, director general of Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art and the wife of Lee Kun-hee; Seok-hyun; Seok-joh, CEO of BGF Retail; Suk-joon, CEO of Bokwang Investment; Seok-kyu, CEO of Bokwang; and Ra-young, deputy director at Leeum. Kim was also the mother-in-law of Cholsoo Charles Lho, publisher of the Korea JoongAng Daily. Kim Youn-nam died of natural causes at Samsung Medical Center in Gangnam District, southern Seoul in 2013 when she was 90 years old.\n\nHong Ra-hee majored in applied art at Seoul National University and gained experience as a museum art director in 1995 at Ho-am Art Museum in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province. The museum was established by Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul in 1978.\n\nHis siblings and some of their children are also executives of major Korean business groups. Lee Boo-jin, his eldest daughter, is president and CEO of Hotel Shilla, a luxury hotel chain, as well as president of Samsung Everland, a theme park and resort operator that is \"widely seen as the de facto holding company for the conglomerate\" according to Associated Press. As of 2010, his son Lee Jae-yong is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics.\n\nLee has 4 children: the eldest child and the only son Lee Jae-yong (born 1968) and three daughters Lee Boo-jin (born 1970), Lee Seo-hyun (born 1973) and Lee Yoon-hyung (born 1979, died 2005)†.\nLee's eldest brother's son is currently chairman and CEO of the CJ Group, a company holding businesses in food, beverages and adult entertainment. His second eldest brother's sons ran Saehan Media, one of the largest blank media producers. His older sister is the owner of Hansol Group, the country's largest paper manufacturer and producer of electronics and telecommunications. One of his sisters is married to Koo Ja-hak, brother of a former chairman of the LG Group and himself a former chairman of LG Semiconductor. He is currently running one of the largest food services firms in South Korea. Lee's younger sister, Lee Myung-hee, is chairwoman of the Shinsegae Group, the largest retail company in South Korea, with major holdings such as the Shinsegae Department Stores and E-Mart. His daughter Lee Yoon-hyung committed suicide in Manhattan in 2005.\n\nIn late 2005, Lee was tested for cancer at the MD Anderson Medical Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nLee's older brother Lee Maeng-hee and older sister Lee Sook-hee initiated legal action against him in February 2012, asking a South Korean court to award them shares of Samsung companies totaling US$850 million (913.563 billion won), which they claim their father willed to them. Court hearings began in May 2012. On February 6, 2014, courts in South Korea dismissed the case. On May 11, 2014, Lee was hospitalized for a heart attack. On May 16, 2014, the AsiaN claimed that Lee had died, citing a whistleblower inside the firm. It deleted the article seven months later, saying it was unable to obtain further information to substantiate the claim.\n\nLee speaks Korean, English, and Japanese.\n\n"}

It culminated in a multi-option white paper for a proposed Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010.\n\nThe National Conversation was launched on 14 August 2007 by Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland. It consisted of a 59-page white paper, titled Choosing Scotland's Future, and a website. The white paper included a draft bill for a referendum to allow for negotiations with the UK Government on Scottish independence. The website encourages comments to be made on the white paper. Comments are encouraged from members of the public, rather than just interest groups.\n\nAs a culmination to the National Conversation, a white paper for the proposed Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010 was published on St. Andrew's Day on 30 November 2009. The 176 page paper was titled, \"Your Scotland, Your Voice\". The paper detailed four possible scenarios for Scotland's future, with the text of the Bill and Referendum to be revealed later. The scenarios were: No Change, Devolution per the Calman Review, Full Devolution, and Full Independence.\n\nOn 6 December 2007, the Scottish Parliament voted to create a Commission on Scottish Devolution, chaired by Sir Kenneth Calman, and with the remit:\n\nThe Commission was supported by the three main pro-Union political parties in Scotland: Labour, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Wendy Alexander, at the time leader of the Labour party in the Scottish Parliament, proposed the motion, rejecting the National Conversation and an amendment proposed by the Scottish National Party calling for support for the National Conversation was defeated, Ms Alexander associating it with moves towards Scottish independence and making the following response:\n\nNotably the remit of the Commission on Scottish Devolution precludes the consideration of Scottish independence.\n\nThe rejection of the National Conversation by the Scottish Parliament has led to criticisms as to its legitimacy. Concerns have also been raised by\n\nOn 24 April 2008, Lord Foulkes, a Labour Member of the Scottish Parliament, claimed that the National Conversation had been met with \"complete indifference\" by the people of Scotland, quoting website visiting figures. He further claimed that the website had become a meeting place for SNP activists, noting also that although 41 comments had been removed from the site, \"there are still anti-English remarks bordering on racism.\"\n\nThe initiative influenced the Parti Québécois and, in March 2008, shortly before the Parti Québécois National Council, leader Pauline Marois presented the party's plan to propose a \"conversation nationale\" to Quebecers as part of Marois' renewal of the party's approach on independence and social democracy. In this case, however, the conversation is to be solely on independence, instead of three options. The expression was met with less enthusiasm in Quebec and arose cynicism in the press and objection with some party hardliners. Shortly after, the Parti Québécois replaced the term with \"débat sur la souveraineté\" (\"debate on sovereignty\").\n\n\n"}

The game was released in German-speaking countries on 31 January 2013. The international German download version for Windows was released through the Steam-service as well. The English version was released just a day after in the rest of Europe whereas the version for the US market was released on 12 February. A version for Mac OS X was published on 2 August 2013.\n\nThe title covers the time of the 1920s - the Roaring Twenties - at the time of the Prohibition in the United States. The game's story takes place in Atlantic City, Atlantic County where, due to the ban of any alcohol in this era, Mafia organizations were able to become powerful off the back of the illegal speakeasys.\n\nIn a time where criminal gangs rule the city and a handful of morally-questionable men were able to succeed through illegal gambling, high-strength spirits and shady machinations, the player's storyline takes place as the main character creates his empire in this melting pot of illegality. Boss D'Angelo is an immigrant who was born in a small village in Sicily and has just arrived in Atlantic City. He has to work his way up the ladder through the -like world. Working his way up from nothing, He must establish himself in the criminal underworld by buying and raiding businesses and attacking rivals, all the while simultaneously fulfilling his version of the American dream.\n\nArriving at Atlantic City, Boss D'Angelo begins his foothold on the criminal empire as he makes money off the prohibition and gambling trade. Sending money back to his brother, he keeps his status as a mob boss secret from him as he works for Louie, a Capo under the eye of Danny Corsini, the leader of the Mafia in Atlantic City. His enemies ranges from independent gangsters to the Ku Klux Klan, which is at bitter odds with the growing immigration problem. Eventually tired of working for Louie, he was sent to perform one last job which was revealed to be a trap, as Danny Corsini was the intended target. The Boss thwarts the assassination and becomes a Capo under Corsini.\n\nExpanding his criminal empire eventually allows his brother to come to Atlantic City but not as a brother in crime an FBI Agent in New York. When the Boss' attempts to set up a source of income through the gambling/nightclub trade draw suspicion to him, Danny Corsini attempts to defend him killing his brother. Forced to turn on Corsini, the Boss emerges victorious. Knowing that his position is fragile, he attempts to unite the Jewish Gangs and Irish Mob in an alliance only for it to be attacked by the KKK. With the D'Angelo mob as the sole survivor of the struggle, the Boss is named Capo de Tutti. He later earns money through real estate and by supporting Mr. Smith as mayor which gives him great influence in the city, upon reaching Michigan Ave his brother offers one last chance for the Boss to come clean, the Boss rejects the idea of selling his men out and eliminates the witnesses who planned to rat out the boss. The Boss came out clean and triumphant and made amends with his brother and owns a private island which he calls Nova Sicilia and his brother left the agency to pursue his dream of being a shipwright and vowed to never speak of their days in the prohibition again.\n\nThe Japanese Incentive\n\nSomewhere in between the meeting of his brother and the death of Louie Castaneda, Boss D'Angelo receives a lucrative offer from a Japanese Yakuza Hikaro Eda and Fritz, a backer who wanted to help Eda exert his influence into America as laws back then prohibited Asians from owning property. There he meets the beautiful Mikoto Mori, the trophy wife of the Yakuza boss. Little did the boss know, she has a personal vendetta against Hikaro and the Boss now is caught in between love for the woman and the wrath of a powerful man.\n\nThe story begins with Karl Fritz who approaches the Boss with a deal from Hikaro Eda, an influential Japanese man who had him muscle into McGyure Clan's turf and quickly proves his worth to Hikaro and was tasked with a smuggling job from him. Upon preventing the McGyure Clan from destroying the cargo did he realize what was he smuggling, his wife Kumiko Mori. Angered by the McGyure's attempt at murdering her he personally wipes out the clan and earns a promising alliance with the Yakuza. When Hikaro and his men were attacked at a Cherry Blossom festival by members of the Ku Klux Klan did Hikaro sent him to find who tried to kill him and the Boss learned that Hikaro's own wife was the culprit. Sickened by this senseless conflict he tries to run off with her in an attempt to escape from the criminal underworld only to be dragged down by Hikaro when he tries to kill them both. Then she reveals her past, her family's lands was taken away by Eda and her sister was killed by Hikaro and she was forced to become the bride and assassin of Hikaro. They both work together to take down Eda and eventually have feelings for one another but the heist on Eda's personal assets goes awry when Mikoto goes off to try and kill Eda only to die in the process, in a fit of rage the Boss personally attacks Eda and gets his revenge for Mikoto as he bitterly says that she was the first and last woman he had ever truly loved.\n\nOmerta, the game's title, refers to the infamous honor code called \"Omertà\", a \"Code of silence\" which binds members of the Mafia or similar criminal organizations to professional discretion against any third parties.\n\nUpon the official retail-release of the boxed- and digital distributed version, the game was also simultaneously released on GOG.com without any copy-protection, nor other digital rights management restrictions.\n\nBeginning with small deals, the player gradually expands his criminal career, eventually advancing highly enough to establish his own business. The player can purchase untenanted shops, buildings and structures to establish his own bar, brewery or distillery. The player can also buy out an opposing \"speakeasy\". A more legal way for generating income is buying apartments to obtain leasing. Warehouses can be acquired to extend storage.\n\nAs the game progresses, the character can recruit companions, create his own gang, and conquer the territories of rival gangsters. Characters provide specific role-playing elements based on their individual characteristics and equipment. In these turn-based confrontations, the player expands his influence by using henchmen to drive other godfathers out of business, to ultimately reign supreme as the unchallenged patron of Atlantic City.\n\nIn addition to co-operative and competitive multiplayer game-play, the game offers a sandbox mode to freely explore the game world – six district maps covering \"Atlantic City\".\n\nThe game provides an explorable three-dimensional world which is displayed through a Top-down perspective. The in-game world represents, according to the publisher Kalypso Media, an almost accurate and historical correct reproduction of the American city \"Atlantic City\" of this period.\n\nReal vintage buildings and places are present like the Traymore Hotel, the Absecon Lighthouse, the \"Atlantic City Jail-house\" or the board-walk \"Eastern Promenade\" as well as streets like \"Illinois Avenue\" or the \"North Carolina Avenue\" which ends at the beach. Beside those real buildings the remaining ones - which are shown in Art Deco - are very similar to each other and seems to consist only of a few types.\n\nKalypso Media licensed the name 'Omerta' from the MMORPG browser based game of the same name, Omerta.\n\nMetacritic aggregated a score of 54 from 100 points for the Windows version.\n\n\"PCGamer\" gave the PC-version a rating of 78 out of 100 points, praising the game's mechanics as well as the AI while comparing its combat style elements to X-COM or Jagged Alliance. The story is described as too superficial and simple, just depth-less. The atmospheric music, on the other hand, was lauded as a brilliant melange of the Jazz, Ragtime and Klezmer music of the period.\n\nRating the game at just 30 percent, \"Metro GameCentral\" tested the PC-version as well. Initially intrigued by the promise of a new kind of \"made-men\" game, the turn-based combat system was ultimately deemed ungainly.\n\n\"Hooked Gamer\" gave the PC-version a rating of 8.4 out of 10. It describes the game as \"different\", and the turn-based combats as short but satisfying.\n\n"}

When it was completed in 1828 it was the tallest structure in the United States. \n\nThe tower was originally known as the \"Phoenix Shot Tower\", then the \"Merchants' Shot Tower\", and now is also sometimes called the \"Old Baltimore Shot Tower\". It is the only surviving shot tower among three that existed in Baltimore, and was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 11, 1971. It was designated as a local Baltimore City Landmark on October 14, 1975.\n\nThe Shot Tower lends its name to the nearby Shot Tower/Market Place station on the Baltimore Metro subway system's northeast line. Additionally, the original Baltimore Bullets were named in honor of its role in producing shot.\n\nThe tower was built by Jacob Wolfe using bricks manufactured by the Burns and Russell Company of Baltimore. Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, a Roman Catholic lay leader and wealthiest man in America at that time, laid its cornerstone.\n\nThe circular brick structure's walls are thick from the bottom to about up; then they narrow in stages of each, until reaching a thickness of at the top.\n\nMolten lead was dropped from a platform at the top of the tower, through a sieve-like device, into a vat of cold water at the bottom of the tower to produce both \"drop shot\" for pistols and rifles and \"moulded shot\" for larger weapons such as cannons. When hardened, dried, and polished, the shot was sorted into 25-pound bags. The annual production was about 100,000 bags of shot a year, with the capability of doubling that in case of war or other high demand.\n\nThe tower stopped producing shot in 1892, when a new method of making shot made the tower obsolete. It re-opened for a brief period of production at the beginning of the twentieth century, and then closed for good.\n\nThe tower remained the tallest structure in the United States until 1846, when Trinity Church, New York on Wall Street was erected, and the tallest in Baltimore until the completion of the spire of the First Presbyterian Church at West Madison Street and Park Avenue in the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood in 1875.\nThe shot tower was originally owned by the Merchants' Shot Tower Company which closed in 1898.\n\nIn 1921 the tower was purchased for $14,500 by the Union Oil Company, which planned to tear it down and put a gas station in its place. After strong objections by the community, by 1928 enough money had been raised to purchase the tower and present it to the City of Baltimore as one of its first preserved local historic landmarks.\n\nThe tower was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1971 and a bronze plaque was attached to the tower's brick wall at the base. In the early 1980s, the management, exhibits, and tours were combined with those of the former Peale Museum. In 1985, other historic sites and homes were added to the newly created Baltimore City Life Museums system. The BCLM was closed in 1997, and in 2002 Carroll Museums, Inc was created to manage both the Carroll Mansion and the Shot Tower.\n\n"}

After facing violent repression, such as during the 1934 United Fruit Strike, unions gained more power following the 1948 Costa Rican Civil War, and public sector unions appeared. Previous administrations and assesmblies paid very little attention to Costa Rica's trade unions;, however when the Luis Guillermo Solís and the 2014 legislative assembly took office, Solís and eight members of the Citizens' Action Party and Broad Front promised to listen to unions. Libertarian Otto Guevara expressed concern. Today, Costa Rican unions are strongest in the public sector, including the fields of education and medicine. There is also a strong presence in agricultural sectors for unions. In general, Costa Rican unions support government regulation of the banking, medical, and education fields, as well as improved wages and working conditions.\n\nOne important issue for public sector unions is passage of the Código Procesal Laboral (Procedural Labor Law), which former president Laura Chinchilla vetoed. If passed, Chinchilla said it would allow emergency service workers, such as police, medical service staff and doctors to strike. President Luis Guillermo Solís said that the issue of the Procedural Labor Law should be finalized within his first year in office. Legislative Assembly president Henry Mora Jiménez, also supported the law, as do the public sector unions.\n\nThere are public-sector trade unions in Europe that negotiate agreements between public employees and the institutions for which they work. In 2010, severe financial crises forced several governments to cut back on wages and benefits in austerity measures, leading to protests, most notably in Greece. In Greece, a one-day protest was held because of requirements placed by the EU on Greece's public spending.\n\nLabor unions generally bypassed government employees because they were controlled mostly by the patronage system used by the political parties before the arrival of civil service. \nPost Office workers did form unions. The National Association of Letter Carriers started in 1889 and grew quickly. By the mid-1960s it had 175,000 members in 6,400 local branches.\n\nSeveral competing organizations of postal clerks emerged starting in the 1890s. Merger discussions dragged on for years, until finally the NFPOC, UNMAPOC and others merged in 1961 as the United Federation of Postal Clerks. Another round of mergers in 1971 produced the American Postal Workers Union (APWU). In 2012 the APWU had 330,000 members. The various postal unions did not engage in strikes.\nHistorian Joseph Slater, says, \"Unfortunately for public sector unions, the most searing and enduring image of their history in the first half of the twentieth century was the Boston police strike. The strike was routinely cited by courts and officials through the end of the 1940s.\" Governor Calvin Coolidge broke the strike and the legislature took control of the police away from city officials.\n\nThe police strike chilled union interest in the public sector in the 1920s. The major exception was the emergence of unions of public school teachers in the largest cities; they formed the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), affiliated with the AFL. In suburbs and small cities, the National Education Association (NEA) became active, but it insisted it was not a labor union but a professional organization.\n\nIn the mid 1930s efforts were made to unionize WPA workers, but were opposed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Moe points out that Roosevelt, \"an ardent supporter of collective bargaining in the private sector, was opposed to it in the public sector.\" Roosevelt in 1937 told the nation what the position of his government was: \"All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service... The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations.\n\nChange came in the 1950s. In 1958 New York mayor Robert Wagner, Jr. issued an executive order, called \"the little Wagner Act,\" giving city employees certain bargaining rights, and gave their unions with exclusive representation (that is, the unions alone were legally authorized to speak for all city workers, regardless of whether or not some workers were members.) Management complained but the unions had power in city politics.\n\nBy the 1960s and 1970s public-sector unions expanded rapidly to cover teachers, clerks, firemen, police, prison guards and others. In 1962, President John Kennedy issued Executive Order 10988, upgrading the status of unions of federal workers.\n\nAfter 1960 public sector unions grew rapidly and secured good wages and high pensions for their members. While manufacturing and farming steadily declined, state- and local-government employment quadrupled from 4 million workers in 1950 to 12 million in 1976 and 16.6 million in 2009.\n\nIn 2009 the U.S. membership of public sector unions surpassed membership of private sector unions for the first time, at 7.9m and 7.4m respectively.\n\nIn 2011 states faced a growing fiscal crisis and the Republicans had made major gains in the 2010 elections. Public sector unions came under heavy attack especially in Wisconsin, as well as Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio from conservative Republican legislatures. 2012 update. Conservative state legislatures tried to drastically reduce the abilities of unions to collectively bargain. Conservatives argued that public unions were too powerful since they helped elect their bosses, and that overly generous pension systems were too heavy a drain on state budgets.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "776293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=776293", "title": "Rodney Frelinghuysen", "text": "Rodney Frelinghuysen\n\nRodney Procter Frelinghuysen (born April 29, 1946) is the U.S. Representative for , serving since 1995. The district includes most of Morris County, an affluent suburban county west of New York City. It also includes some of the wealthier areas near Newark and Paterson, and is the 10th richest congressional district in the nation in terms of median income. A member of the Republican Party, Frelinghuysen has served as Chair of the House Appropriations Committee since 2017. Frelinghuysen announced on January 29, 2018, that he would not seek re-election that year.\n\nOn domestic issues, he has at times supported abortion rights and at times voted to limit access to abortion, opposed federal funding of Planned Parenthood, and opposed sanctuary cities, gun control, gay marriage, and federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. He endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. He voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and replace it with the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Frelinghuysen was criticized for using a fundraising letter to \"[out] a member of an activist group opposing him to her employer\" which resulted in a complaint by the Campaign for Accountability made with the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nFrelinghuysen was born in New York City to Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., a New Jersey politician and Beatrice Sterling Procter, an heir to the Procter & Gamble fortune.\n\nFrelinghuysen is a member of a family long prominent in New Jersey politics, one which was ranked the seventh greatest American political dynasty by Stephen H. Hess, senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institution, and author of \"America's Political Dynasties\".\n\nHis father, Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., served as the U.S. Representative from New Jersey's 5th congressional district from 1953–75, representing much of the same area Rodney does today. He is the great-great-grandson of Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen, who was a U.S. Senator for New Jersey and U.S. Secretary of State in the administration of President Chester A. Arthur. His great-great-great-uncle, the adoptive father of Frederick Theodore, Theodore Frelinghuysen was a U.S. Senator for New Jersey, served as president of both New York University and Rutgers College, and was the vice-presidential running mate of Henry Clay on the Whig ticket in the presidential election of 1844. Frelinghuysen's great-great-great-great-grandfather Frederick Frelinghuysen was one of the framers of the first Constitution of New Jersey, a U.S. Senator for New Jersey, and a soldier in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nAside from the Frelinghuysen name, he is a great-great-great-grandson of Peter Ballantine, founder of Ballantine Brewery in Newark. On his mother's side, he is a great-great-grandson of William Procter, co-founder of Procter & Gamble.\n\nHe attended St. Mark's School, an exclusive Episcopal preparatory school in Southborough, Massachusetts. Rejected by Princeton, the alma mater of his father and grandfather, Frelinghuysen instead matriculated at Hobart College in New York. There he served as president of the Kappa Alpha Society and earned a BA in American history in 1969.\n\nFrelinghuysen next enrolled in a graduate program at Trinity College but was soon drafted into the United States Army. Following basic training at Fort Dix, he was assigned as a clerk to the commanding officer of the 93rd Engineer Battalion, which was primarily responsible for building roads and water supply systems in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam.\n\nAfter his military service, Frelinghuysen was hired by then-Morris County Freeholder Director Dean A. Gallo to be the county's state and federal aid coordinator and administrative assistant. He held this position until 1974, when he was elected as a Morris County Freeholder in his own right. He served three terms on the board, the last as its director.\n\nIn 1983, Frelinghuysen was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, representing the 25th legislative district. Frelinghuysen served in the Assembly until 1994. He was Chairman of the Assembly Appropriations Committee during the 1988–89 legislative session. In 1990 he ran in the Republican primary for New Jersey's 12th congressional district against Dick Zimmer and Phil McConkey.\n\nDuring the race, the Frelinghuysen campaign \"broke ground in high-tech politicking\" when it sent voters a seven-minute video cassette of Frelinghuysen. The video, which contained photographs of Frelinghuysen in Vietnam and praise from former Gov. Tom Kean, served as a preemptive tactic against opponents' attempts to characterize Frelinghuysen as \"an irrelevant debutante\". Frelinghuysen finished in third place.\n\nIn late August 1994, U.S. Congressman Dean Gallo, the six-term Republican incumbent of New Jersey's Eleventh Congressional District, announced his intention to withdraw from the upcoming election for medical reasons (he had recently been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and died two days before the election). As Gallo had already defeated three opponents in a hard-fought primary the previous June, his withdrawal triggered a convention of Republican committee members from the district's municipalities. Frelinghuysen, who had been Gallo's former employee and fellow Morris County freeholder and state assemblyman, sought the committee's nomination at Gallo's request, and was chosen to be the Republican nominee for the district.\n\nFrelinghuysen went on to defeat former Democratic State Senator Frank Herbert 71% to 28% in the November 1994 election. However, the 11th had long been one of the most Republican districts in the Northeast, and Frelinghuysen had effectively clinched a seat in Congress by winning the Republican nomination. He was reelected nine times with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 59% of the vote. He has been challenged in the Republican primary three times: in 2008, 2010, and 2014. In 2008, he defeated Kate Erber in the June primary 87% to 13%. In 2010, he defeated Richard Luzzi 76% to 24%. In 2014, he defeated Rick Van Glahn 67% to 33%. On January 29, 2018 Frelinghuysen announced that he wouldn't run for another term in 2018.\n\nIn 2000, progressive activist filmmaker Michael Moore attempted to have a ficus challenge Frelinghuysen's unopposed re-election to make the point that most Members of Congress \"run unopposed in their primaries and 95% are re-elected every time in the general election\", adding \"we think it's time to point out to the Frelinghuysen family that we live in a democracy, not a dynasty.\"\n\nThe top sectors supporting Frelinghuysen's campaigns have been the aerospace, defense, pharmaceutical and health care industries.\n\n\n\nSince the start of his congressional tenure in 1995, Frelinghuysen has been the chief sponsor of 123 bills. Of these, four have become law:\n\nHe has been the chief sponsor of nine resolutions, none of which passed. He introduced an amendment to the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, the initial Hurricane Sandy relief legislation, which added $33.7 billion to the $17 billion initially allocated by the act. The amendment passed the House in a 228–192 vote, with the support of 38 Republicans and 190 Democrats. The amended act was not significantly modified by the Senate, and was signed into law.\n\nAs of January 2018, Frelinghuysen had voted with his party in 95.4% of votes so far in the 115th United States Congress and voted in line with President Trump's position in 90.2% of the votes. From the start of his tenure in the 104th Congress to the current 113th, Frelinghuysen has voted with his party 90% of the time.\n\nFrelinghuysen's voting record has been described as moderate. He is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership. During the 2012 election season, Frelinghuysen rejected claims from Planned Parenthood leaders and progressive activists that he \"toes the line of Republican leadership\" and had aligned himself with the Tea Party movement.\n\nAs Frelinghuysen is less conservative than many members of the Republican caucus, he was elevated to the Appropriations Committee chairship only based on his assurance to the conservatives that he would be willing to set aside his personal views to implement party policy. One conservative on the committee, Representative Robert Aderholt, said, \"One of the things we had discussed going into this, when he wanted to take the chairmanship, was that at the end of the day he understood that when he was negotiating these bills he'd be negotiating on behalf of his conference, as opposed to his own philosophy.\"\n\nIn a tele-townhall on March 20, 2017, he stated that was \"not sold\" on attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) and had not seen any evidence to support claims that President Trump was wiretapped during the campaign. He believes Trump should release his tax returns, but does not support attempts to compel their release, adding \"I need to support the Chair's ruling regardless of what the issue is.\"\n\nFrelinghuysen is a member of Republican Majority For Choice and Republicans for Choice. In 2017, he voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would have implemented a national ban on abortions performed after 20 weeks of gestation.\n\nFrom 2010-12, his NARAL rating averaged 7%. He and fellow New Jersey Republican Leonard Lance were singled out by NARAL President Nancy Keenan over their support of H.R. 3 \"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act\". Frelinghuysen voted in 2015 to strip all federal funding from Planned Parenthood, despite having opposed similar measures in 2011, 2009 and 2007. He cited the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy for his change in position.\n\nIn October 2017, Frelinghuysen was the only representative from New Jersey to vote in favor of a Republican budget resolution that would increase the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion. He said he voted \"for the budget resolution to get my appropriations bills done\" and that he would \"evaluate tax reform when I see the details.\" In December 2017, Frelinghuysen voted against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\nFrelinghuysen is a supporter of earmarking, calling the practice a \"constitutional responsibility.\" He consistently ranks in the top 5% in terms of dollars procured. In fiscal year 2008 he ranked 21st, sponsoring or co-sponsoring 44 earmarks totaling $88 million; in fiscal year 2009 he ranked 12th, with 45 earmarks totaling $119 million; and in fiscal year 2010 he ranked 21st with 39 earmarks totaling $76 million. During the same period, Frelinghuysen was the top earmarker among New Jersey lawmakers. The majority of his earmarks were for defense-related expenses.\n\nFrelinghuysen's environmental position, as measured by the League of Conservation Voters annual \"Environmental National Scorecard\", was largely centrist from 1995 to 2008, averaging 55%. Beginning in 2009, his environmental record veered sharply negative, averaging just 14% over the next nine years, through 2017. In 2017 Frelinghuysen was given a rating of 9%, the lowest of any New Jersey congressional representative. As of 2017, Frelinghuysen's lifetime LCV Scorecard score was 33%.\n\nIn May, 2003, Frelinghuysen introduced H.R. 1964, the Highlands Conservation Act, a bill that recognized \"the importance of the water, forest, agricultural, wildlife, recreational, and cultural resources of the Highlands region, and the national significance of the Highlands region to the United States\", and authorized up to $10 million a year in federal matching funds for land preservation and protection in the Highlands states (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut), as well as $1 million a year for United States Forest Service research and technical assistance programs. In November, 2004, George W. Bush signed the Highlands Conservation Act into law. In 2014, Congress failed to re-authorize the Act and the program expired.\n\nAs of May, 2014 Frelinghuysen was one of eight Republican members of Congress who \"accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is both real and man-made,\" according to PolitiFact. However, he opposes federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The Sunlight Foundation pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Frelinghuysen has the third-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.\nHe favors repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and voted in support of the budget resolution to repeal Obamacare in January 2017. In March 2017, when the Republican leadership was seeking support for the \"repeal-and-replace\" bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), he announced that he would oppose it on the grounds that it \"would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey\" and would result in a \"loss of Medicaid coverage for so many people in my Medicaid-dependent state.\" On May 4, 2017, he voted for a revised version of the AHCA, although the provisions he had previously cited as objectionable were unchanged. He said that he \"voted for an improved health care act\".\n\nFrelinghuysen stressed the need to \"protect those with pre-existing conditions\", but according to NJ.com, the bill \"would allow for exemptions from rules preventing those with pre-existing conditions from being charged more for their insurance. It also would allow states to request waivers from federal requirements that all insurers cover specific benefits such as hospitalization, mental health treatment and maternity care.\" Asked why he voted for the bill without waiting for an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office on its impact, Frelinghuysen said, \"I think there was a feeling that we needed to act and get the bill to the Senate so we can get them to act on it.\"\n\nFrelinghuysen opposes sanctuary cities.\n\nAs Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, he was part of the 29 representatives voting to send the 2018 Homeland Security appropriations bill to the full House. Among other funding, the bill includes $5 billion in funding for Trump's border wall. Referring to the bill, Frelinghuysen stated the bill \"provides the necessary funding for critical technology and physical barriers to secure our borders\".\n\nFrelinghuysen endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFrelinghuysen is in favor of auditing the Federal Reserve, and supported the Iraq War. He opposes same-sex marriage, and has voted against legislation which would establish net neutrality, which refers to the principle that Internet service providers cannot discriminate by user, content, website, or platform, and has voted in favor of legislation that would require photo IDs for voting in federal elections.\n\nHe has a \"D\" rating from NORML regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. He twice voted against providing veterans access to medical marijuana via their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation. He blocked a vote on an amendment that would have given banks the ability to lend to legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses without having to worry about subsequent punishment by federal financial regulators.\n\nFrelinghuysen, who has not appeared at a public town hall since 2013, prefers small events at schools, community groups, and veteran organizations, according to \"The New York Times\". Since the 2016 election, a grassroots activist group called NJ 11th for Change has organized demonstrations and town halls in an effort to get a face-to-face between Frelinghuysen and his constituents.\n\nIn 2017, Frelinghuysen wrote a campaign fundraising letter to a board member of a local bank. While Frelinghuysen did not name NJ 11th for Change, a progressive lobbying group, he included a handwritten postscript warning \"One of the ringleaders works in your bank!\", with an attached news article about one of NJ 11th for Change's members. The individual subsequently resigned from her position as assistant general counsel and senior vice president at that bank, citing pressure over her political involvement as one of the reasons.\n\nAccording to a lawyer and former staffer for the Office of Congressional Ethics, to be unlawful such a letter would need to threaten action or be written on congressional stationery, not campaign letterhead, and/or the bank would have to have business pending before a Frelinghuysen committee. The progressive lobbying group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) opined that \"whether or not [Frelinghuysen's letter] breaks a criminal statute is one issue, but the very clear issue is that it appears that a member of Congress might be using his power to threaten someone's employment because of their political activities.\" Richard W. Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota and former chief White House ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, described Frelinghuysen's actions as \"not illegal but an awful thing to do.\"\n\nNonprofit ethics watchdog Campaign for Accountability filed a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics requesting an investigation into whether Frelinghuysen violated House ethics rules in his letter to the board member of the bank. Anyone can file a complaint with the Office of Congressional Ethics; the office reviews complaints from the public and can choose to refer those it considers valid to the House Ethics Committee.\nFrelinghuysen hired lawyers following the complaint.\n\nIn June 2013, Frelinghuysen was awarded the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award, the Navy's highest civilian honor, for the \"long and selfless service\" he had provided to the force, ensuring it had necessary resources and supporting its members' quality of life.\n\nFrelinghuysen was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal for his service during the Vietnam War.\n\nAt the start of the 112th Congress, Frelinghuysen was ranked the ninth wealthiest member of congress, with an estimated personal wealth between $20 million and $65 million.\n\nA CQ Roll Call report on Frelinghuysen's wealth in 2010 indicated that about a third stemmed from personal and family trust investments in Procter & Gamble stock. He owns multiple properties, including nearly 18 acres of undeveloped land in Frelinghuysen Township, New Jersey.\n\nOn May 24, 2007, Frelinghuysen chased down a pickpocket who had stolen his wallet near his home in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Two Washington police officers saw the chase and arrested the 18-year-old suspect who had been caught by the 61-year-old congressman.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1994, Stuart Bacha received 436 votes.

Disney\n\nRoy Oliver Disney (June 24, 1893 – December 20, 1971) was an American businessman, becoming the partner and co-founder, along with his younger brother Walt Disney, of Walt Disney Productions, since renamed The Walt Disney Company.\n\nRoy was born to Irish-Canadian Elias Charles Disney and English-German-American Flora Call Disney in Chicago, Illinois. The family moved to Marceline, Missouri, in 1896, and to Kansas City in 1911. On July 1, 1911, Elias purchased a newspaper delivery route for \"The Kansas City Star\". It extended from Twenty-seventh Street to the Thirty-first Street, and from Prospect Avenue to Indiana Avenue. Roy and Walt were put to work delivering the newspapers. The Disneys delivered the morning newspaper \"The Kansas City Times\" to about 700 customers, and the evening and Sunday \"The Kansas City Star\" to more than 600. The number of customers served increased with time.\n\nRoy graduated from the Manual Training High School of Kansas City in 1912. He left the paper delivery route and worked on a farm over the summer. He then found employment as a bank clerk along with his brother Raymond Arnold Disney at the First National Bank of Kansas City.\n\nRoy served in the United States Navy from 1917 to 1919. A year later his brother Walt tried to join the U.S. Army but was refused because he was underage. After Roy contracted tuberculosis, he was discharged from military duty and became a banker in Los Angeles. In 1923 Walt moved to Hollywood, joined Roy, and the two founded the Disney Bros. Studio. The brothers ordered kit houses from Pacific Ready Cut Homes (a Los Angeles company) and, in 1928, built their homes side by side on Lyric Avenue in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nWhile Walt was the creative man, Roy was the one who made sure the company was financially stable. Roy and Walt both founded Disney Studios as brothers, but Walt would buy out most of Roy's share in 1929 so, unlike Max and Dave Fleischer of rival Fleischer Studios, Roy was not a co-producer. However, Roy would be equal partner in all facets of the production company.\n\nRoy became the company's first CEO in 1929, although the official title was not given until 1968. He also shared the role of chairman of the board with Walt from 1945. Walt however dropped the chairman title in 1960 so he could focus more on the creative aspects of the company. After Walt Disney's death in 1966, Roy postponed his retirement to oversee construction of what was then known as Disney World. He later renamed it Walt Disney World as a tribute to his brother. Roy became the president of Walt Disney Productions on December 15, 1966, and remained so until 1968.\n\nRoy was married to Edna Francis from April 1925 until his death. Their son, Roy Edward Disney, was born on January 10, 1930. Throughout his life, Roy rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Walt's brother. He was extremely camera shy and a passive individual, resulting in few public photos being in existence.\n\nAfter Walt Disney World opened in October 1971, Roy Oliver Disney finally retired. On December 20, 1971 at age 78, he died from a intracranial hemorrhage. He is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) in Los Angeles.\n\nOne of the Walt Disney World Railroad locomotives was named after Roy. On June 6, 2002, his son Roy E. Disney rededicated this locomotive in his father's honor. As of 2016, this locomotive became a hundred years old.\n\nOne of the Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad locomotives is also named the Roy O. Disney.\n\nA statue of Roy Oliver Disney seated on a park bench beside Minnie Mouse is located in the Town Square section of Main Street, U.S.A., at the Magic Kingdom theme park in Florida. A duplicate is located outside the Team Disney building at Disney's corporate headquarters in Burbank, California. There is a third statue at the Tokyo Disneyland theme park. The Roy O. Disney Suite is located on the top floor of the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel.\n\nIn 2014, Roy O. Disney was portrayed in the feature film \"Walt Before Mickey\" by Jon Heder.\n\n\n\n"}

Dawes (July 4, 1838 – August 1, 1899) was a military officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He used the middle initial \"R\" but had no middle name. He was noted for his service in the famed Iron Brigade, particularly during the Battle of Gettysburg. He was a post-war businessman, Congressman, and author, and the father of four nationally known sons, one of whom, Charles G. Dawes, won the Nobel Peace Prize and served as Vice President of the United States, and of two daughters. He was himself a great-grandson of William Dawes, who alerted colonial minutemen of the approach of the British army prior to the Battles of Lexington and Concord at the outset of the American Revolution, and a maternal great-grandson of the Rev. Manasseh Cutler, who was instrumental in adoption of the Northwest ordinance of 1787, led the formation of the Ohio Company of Associates, and became \"Father of Ohio University\".\nHaving migrated to Wisconsin prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, Dawes organized a volunteer company from Juneau County in May, was elected Captain and appointed as such by the State on May 5, and on July 16, 1861, his Company K was mustered into the 6th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry for three years service. The regiment served for almost a year in Northern Virginia without seeing major action. In June, 1862, Dawes was promoted to major. He served with his regiment at the Battle of Groveton and at Antietam and Fredericksburg. In March, 1863, Dawes received a promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel and served in the Chancellorsville Campaign, leading a river crossing under fire at Fitzhugh's Crossing on April 29.\n\nDuring the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, Dawes led a counterattack on Confederate Brigadier General Joseph R. Davis's brigade of the 2nd, 11th and 42nd Mississippi Infantry Regiments and the 55th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, many of whom were sheltered in an unfinished railroad cut west of town, and forced the surrender of more than 200 of the Confederate soldiers. He later served that year in the Mine Run Campaign. During a furlough, Dawes returned to Ohio and married Mary Beman Gates (1842–1921), from Marietta, Ohio, on January 18, 1864. Returning to the Army of the Potomac, he served at the Battle of the Wilderness and the Siege of Petersburg In July 1864, Dawes was offered the full rank of colonel, but declined the promotion. He was mustered out of the army on August 10, 1864, following the Battles of Spotsylvania and Cold Harbor.\n\nOn February 24, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Dawes for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on April 10, 1866.\n\nAfter the war, Dawes became a Companion of the Ohio Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.\n\nSome of Dawes' letters are available to researchers. From his time in the Civil War, Dawes likely suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was able to cope with the symptoms.\n\nDawes returned home to Marietta, Ohio and entered the lumber business. In August of that year, his son Charles Gates Dawes was born, a future Vice President of the United States. In July 1867, Rufus C. Dawes was born at the family home. He would become a well-respected businessman and lawyer, being awarded Chicago's Most Distinguished Citizen Award\" in 1934. A third son, Beman Gates Dawes, would later serve as a Congressman from Ohio, and Henry May Dawes would be a powerful banker who would serve as Comptroller of the Currency for the United States under Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. Rufus and Mary Dawes also had two daughters, Mary Frances Dawes Beach and Betsey Dawes Hoyt.\n\nDawes also served on the Board of Trustees of Marietta College from 1871 until his death, 28 years later. He was also a Trustee for Ohio's Institute for the Deaf and Dumb. Dawes was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1881 as a representative from the 15th Congressional District. A Republican, he served for one term before losing his bid for re-election because he voted against the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 In 1890, he published a well-received account of his Civil War career, \"Service with the 6th Wisconsin Volunteers.\" This memoir was republished in Madison, Wisconsin by the State Historical Society of Wisconsin for the Wisconsin Civil War Centennial Commission, in 1962. His reputation as an orator and his influential voice for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Persia prompted President William McKinley to offer Dawes the position of Minister to Persia in 1897, a post he declined due to failing health.\n\nDawes died two years later, August 1, 1899, in Marietta, Ohio and was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, Marietta.\n\nDawes was elected to Marietta College's Hall of Honor in 2003.\n\n\n\n"}

The bill also provides guidelines for the formation of special fast trial courts. \n\nAfter the Saradha Group financial scandal, the Government of India formed an inter-ministerial group to find ways to close off loopholes the regulations which allowed such pyramid schemes to operate. The Securities Law (Amendment) Ordinance was promulgated on 17 July 2013, then for a second time in September 2013. It lapsed on 15 January 2014. The bill couldn't be presented in the winter session of Parliament as the standing committee on finance had not finalized the report. It promulgated for a third time on 28 March 2014. \n\nOn 24 July 2014, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the bill. The bill was introduced by Minister of State for Finance Nirmala Sitharaman in the Lok Sabha on 4 August 2014. She also introduced bills to amend Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and Depositories Act, 1996. The bills were introduced in the name of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, but he himself was unable to attend the house. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 6 August 2014.\n\nThe ordinance passed in March 2014 had 30 clauses, whereas the bill contained 57 clauses. The bill amended three pre-existing market related laws. It retained the powers given to SEBI in the ordinance, but also introduced safeguards against misuse.\n\nThe new law gave SEBI the power to search and obtain information, including call records, about any suspected entity from within or outside the firm. However, before conducting such searches SEBI must obtain a warrant from a Mumbai court. Any unregistered scheme with a capital of more than a crore was deemed as a collective investment scheme, allowing SEBI to regulate it. Under pre-existing regulations, all collective investment schemes had to register with SEBI. However, many came to SEBI's attention only after complaints from defrauded investors.\n\nDepending on the nature of the crime, minimum penalties may range from lakh to lakh. The minimum penalty for securities related crimes was set at lakh. The minimum penalty for insider trading was at lakh. The maximum penalty for insider trading was set at crore or three times the profit, whichever was higher. SEBI was given the authority to initiate recovery and sale of assets. SEBI has also been given the power to enhance a penalty or settle an ongoing legal proceeding. Guidelines for special courts were also included in the bill.\n\n"}

This article section makes extensive reference to that study.\n\n, the United States Space Shuttle, the Russian Progress, and to a very limited extent, the Russian Soyuz vehicles were the only space transport systems capable of transporting ISS cargo.\n\nHowever, in 2004, it was already anticipated that the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) and Japanese H-IIA Transfer Vehicle (HTV) would be introduced into service before the end of ISS Assembly. As of 2004, the US Shuttle transported the majority of the pressurized and unpressurized cargo and provides virtually all of the recoverable down mass capability (the capability of non-destructive reentry of cargo).\n\nBaker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:\n\nBaker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:\n\nBaker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:\n\nBaker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:\n\nBaker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:\n\nBaker and Eichstadt also wrote, in 2005:\n\nWhile significant focus of space logistics is on \"upmass\", or payload mass carried up to orbit from Earth, space station operations also have significant downmass requirements. \nReturning cargo from low-Earth orbit to Earth is known as transporting \"downmass\", the total logistics payload mass that is returned from space to the surface of the Earth for subsequent use or analysis.\nDownmass logistics are important aspects of research and manufacturing work that occurs in orbital space facilities.\n\nFor the International Space Station, there have been periods of time when downmass capability was severely restricted. For example, for approximately ten months from the time of the retirement of the Space Shuttle following the STS-135 mission in July 2011—and the resultant loss of the Space Shuttle's ability to return payload mass—an increasing concern became returning downmass cargo from low-Earth orbit to Earth for subsequent use or analysis.\nDuring this period of time, of the four space vehicles capable of reaching and delivering cargo to the International Space Station, only the Russian Soyuz vehicle could return even a very small cargo payload to Earth. The Soyuz cargo downmass capability was limited as the entire space capsule was filled to capacity with the three ISS crew members who return on each Soyuz return. None of the remaining cargo resupply vehicles — the Russian Space Agency Progress, the European Space Agency (ESA) ATV, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) HTV — can return any downmass cargo for terrestrial use or examination.\n\nAfter 2012, with the successful berthing of the commercially contracted SpaceX Dragon during the Dragon C2+ mission in May 2012, and the initiation of operational cargo flights in October 2012, downmass capability from the ISS is now per Dragon flight, a service that is uniquely provided by the Dragon cargo capsule.\n\nNine additional Dragon cargo resupply flights are scheduled to depart the ISS with downmass in the next several years.\n\n\n"}
