She excelled at art and design and won a scholarship to study at Sheffield Technical School of Art.\n\nAnnie, together with three other ex-art school students, her sister Dorothy Bindon Carter, Phyllis Lawton and Edith Jagger, all volunteered at Wharncliffe War Hospital, Sheffield during 1915/16. They assisted in the rehabilitation of servicemen returning injured from the Great War through informal art classes. The four women went on to found Painted Fabrics in 1917, with the aim of 'establishing a charitable organisation which would actively rehabilitate severely injured ex-servicemen through occupational therapy'.\n\nThe result was Painted Fabrics, a ground breaking charitable organisation designed to enable severely disabled soldiers and sailors, which included double amputees and those suffering from shell shock to work and to have a roof over their and their families' heads. A policy which adhered to the company's motto 'Work not Charity'.\n\nAnnie, was the wife of the successful Sheffield industrialist, Geoffrey Carter, who was himself, a serving officer abroad. From the outset, Annie, being the dominant personality of the group was instrumental in making sure Painted Fabrics became a limited company in 1923. The company then acquired the lease to a former army camp at Norton, on the south-west edge of Sheffield. The wooden huts became print and design workshops and accommodation was supplied to the men and their families.\n\nThe ex-servicemen hand-printed designs onto various fabrics, using a wide variety of printing techniques. These fabrics were then made up into a myriad of ‘Painted Fabrics products’, which included dresses, table cloths and curtains.\n\nAnnie, affectionately known as \"ABC\" by the employees of Painted Fabrics, dealt with the day-to-day running of the company. She acted as the conduit between the men, the press and the companies illustrious board. As one of the company's five directors and Honorary Secretary, Annie used her administrative skills perfectly, through her, the company were conferred with several Royal Warrants. She was awarded an MBE in 1926, in recognition of her work ‘for disabled soldiers and sailors’.\n\nThe Sheffield Daily Telegraph, in August 1930, wrote about Annie in the ‘Who’s Who in Sheffield’ ; \"It is difficult to write of Mrs. Carter without giving the history of Painted Fabrics, as she has been so closely associated with it. The greatness of the work has often over-shadowed the personality of its originator, who is one of the simplest and happiest of people. An instance of the fine effect that living for others has upon one’s own outlook.\"\n\nBy the early 1930’s, Painted Fabrics Limited employed 36 ex-servicemen and also supported their immediate families. The administration of Painted Fabrics took up most of her time. Despite national press coverage, exhibitions and displays across the country, sales fluctuated and the company faced continual financial hardship. The company effectively ceased in 1939, when the companies site at Norton was requisitioned by the War Office. Painted Fabrics was re-established after World War Two finished, though not to the same extent as its earlier incarnation. Driven by Annie’s self-belief it continued through until it was officially closed in 1959.\n\nShe was awarded an honorary M.A. by the University of Sheffield in 1959. After a visit to the newly built main university library in 1961 (renamed Western Bank Library), she presented the librarian with a cheque for £1,000. These funds were used to purchase ‘outstanding examples of modern book production by private presses’.\n\nAnnie died in 1969. A blue plaque was unveiled in 2000, at the former site of Painted Fabrics, the plaque described Annie Bindon Carter as a ‘humanitarian’. An exhibition featuring work produced by Painted Fabrics entitled ‘Business and Benefaction: the colourful life of Sheffield artist Annie Bindon Carter’, was held at Weston Bank Library, The University of Sheffield in 2016.\n"}

Although such a clause may or may not specify that arbitration occur within a specific jurisdiction, it always binds the parties to a type of resolution outside the courts, and is therefore considered a kind of forum selection clause.\n\nIn the United States, the federal government has expressed a policy of support of arbitration clauses, because they reduce the burden on court systems to resolve disputes. This support is found in the Federal Arbitration Act, which permits compulsory and binding arbitration, under which parties give up the right to appeal an arbitrator's decision to a court. In \"Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co.\", the U.S. Supreme Court established the \"separability principle\", under which enforceability of a contract must be challenged in arbitration before any court action, unless the arbitration clause itself has been challenged.\n\nSome jurisdictions exclude or restrict the possibility of arbitration for reasons of the protection of weaker members of the public, e.g. consumers. For example, German law excludes disputes over the rental of living space from any form of arbitration, while arbitration agreements with consumers are only considered valid if they are signed, and if the signed document does not bear any other content than the arbitration agreement.\n\nMandatory arbitration clauses are widespread but not universal in the United States. For example, they are used by Amazon.com, 15 of the largest 20 U.S. credit card issuers, and 7 of the 8 largest cell phone companies, and 2 out of 3 major bike sharing companies in Seattle.\n\nThe American Arbitration Association provides the following template for an arbitration clause:\nAny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial [or other] Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\nIn keeping with the informality of the arbitration process, the law in England and Wales is generally keen to uphold the validity of arbitration clauses even when they lack the normal formal language associated with legal contracts. Clauses which have been upheld include:\n\nThe courts have also upheld clauses which specify resolution of disputes other than in accordance with a specific legal system. These include provision indicating:\n\nA number of international arbitration bodies provide sample arbitration clauses for parties to use. Examples of these are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires, and earned a \"juris doctor\" in 1970. Bulgheroni developed lymphoma at age 24, but recovered.\n\nHe joined his father Alejandro in Bridas Corporation, founded by the Bulgheroni family in 1948 and by the 1970s one of the largest private firms in the Argentine energy sector. The senior Bulgheroni died in 1985 and left a controlling stake in the firm to Carlos and his elder brother, Alejandro. Carlos Bulgheroni became the firm's chief political point man, establishing good working relationships with the various administrations in power since 1983. He was named president and chairman in 1993; president of the BP-controlled PanAmerican Energy in 1997; of Allis-Chalmers's energy unit in 2006; and of EDIC, a company specializing in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the North African, Russian, Central Asian, and Middle and Far Eastern markets.\n\nBulgheroni obtained, in 1992, some of the first gas exploration concessions granted in Turkmenistan to a foreign energy company. He was further involved during 1997 in negotiations between Bridas and the ruling Taliban faction in Afghanistan to build the Trans-Afghanistan Gas Pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan. These negotiations were in competition with those undertaken by Unocal, and although an agreement with Unocal-led corporation CentGas was reached, the deal was forfeited in January 1998 in favor of one with Bridas. Instability in Afghanistan delayed construction of the pipeline, however, and following the United States Invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the Bridas contract was rescinded in favor of the former one with Unocal. In 2006, Bulgheroni indicated interest in Bridas' involvement with the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline project, which continued to be hampered by the ongoing chaos in the Central Asian nation.\n\nBulgheroni is a co-founder of the Colón Theatre Foundation (1978) and of the Federal District Police Foundation (1989); the latter helps maintain the Churruca Police Officers Hospital, in Buenos Aires. He is also a member of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, the Foundation for Latin American Economic Research (FIEL), the Peres Center for Peace, the Argentine Russian Business Council, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). At CSIS, in addition to acting as a trustee, he also serves as an international councillor and a senior adviser to the Space Exploration Initiative.\n\nHe previously served as co-chairman of the International Committee at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and currently serves as a member there. He is the founder and current partner of the U.S. & Argentine Caucus. He was named Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. Previously, Bulgheroni served as president of the Argentine Business Council, as a member of the Business Advisory Board of the World Trade Organization in Geneva, as president and representative for Mercosur from 1990 to 2002 for the Mercosur European Business Forum, and as a member of the Executive Board of the ICC in Paris. The Bulgheroni brothers sold a 50% stake in Bridas to Chinese oil giant CNOOC in 2010 for US$3.1 billion.

After the war, he attended New York University School of Law at night on the G.I. Bill. While in school, he worked during the day as the advertising director for the trade magazine, \"The Women's Reporter.\" Although he earned a law degree, he instead accepted a job as an account executive with the fashion house, Irving Serwer Advertising. In 1950, he founded Altman & Stoller with fellow Irving Serwer alumni Max Stoller where he served as chairman.\n\nAltman focused on the fashion industry which was ripe for development as most clothing manufacturers typically pitched their concepts direct to the stores rather than develop the brand with the general public. Through his ad campaigns, Altman was credited with transforming then unknown fashion brands into household names. He developed the Wrangler jeans brand with ads that promised that the jeans would fade exactly how teenagers wanted them. He transitioned Monet jewelry from being perceived as low-cost to a premier brand by photographing inexpensive pieces on supermodels. He promoted the Russ Togs brand with a red neon sign the read \"RRRRRRRRRuss Toggs\" at the entrance to the Midtown Tunnel in Manhattan, elongating the name into a sexy purr.

The firm then diversified out of fashion advertising winning accounts with the Spanish tourist board, Ezo denture adhesive, and Lanson champagne, and handled the introduction of Newsweek's Inside Sports magazine.

He financed the Biosphere 2 project, an artificial closed ecological system, which was built between 1987 and 1991. He is the chairman of Fine Line, an investment and venture-capital management firm in Fort Worth, and Chairman of the board of directors of the Sid W. Richardson Foundation, a philanthropic organization. He was listed as #239 on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans in 2012, with an estimated net worth of $2 billion.\n\nBass was born in Fort Worth, Texas to Perry R. (1914–2006) and Nancy Lee (née Muse) Bass (1917-2013), the second-oldest of four sons; his brothers are Lee Marshall Bass, Sid Richardson Bass, and Robert Muse Bass. His father, Perry, was an adviser and later partner of his own bachelor uncle, Sid W. Richardson (1891–1959), starting in the 1930s. When Richardson died, he left each of the Bass brothers $2.8 million, and Perry managed the bulk of the family oil fortune, which was initially beset by legal problems.\n\nEd Bass attended Phillips Academy, and graduated from Yale in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in administrative science. He served for a short time in the United States Coast Guard and returned to Yale, studying for a master's degree in architecture, which he did not complete. All four brothers attended Yale, from which their father had also graduated in 1937.\n\nAfter leaving Yale, Bass \"set out to explore the world\". He moved to New Mexico and spent some time with \"an unusual counterculture group at Synergia Ranch\", run by John P. Allen. While in New Mexico, Bass built the Llano Compound, a condominium in Santa Fe and began an association with Allen that focused on ecology projects. He later spent money on a hotel in Nepal, a Australian ranch, a Puerto Rican rainforest, and the now-defunct Caravan of Dreams performing arts center in Fort Worth.\n\nIn 1984, Bass and Allen founded the Biosphere 2 project, which Bass funded with an initial commitment of $30 million. The project was part of a ranch in the Santa Catalina Mountains in Oracle, Arizona, near Tucson. The purpose of its 3 acre living space was to be an experiment in \"recreating the earth\" and as a possible way to settle Mars. The project began with eight people living inside in an attempt to be a self-contained settlement, raising food and recycling air and water. After the environment was sealed in 1991, noxious gases built up, and while some of the 4,000 species thrived, the water and crops failed in 1994. \n\nIn April 1994 Bass obtained a court order to \"formally oust the key managers of the Biosphere and seize the premises,\" and he dissolved Space Biospheres Ventures, a partnership, which the Los Angeles Times called a \"volatile blend of New Age idealism and corporate sophistication.\" The Biosphere project had in 1992 installed an independent Science Advisory Committee (SAC), chaired by Thomas E. Lovejoy, a senior official at the Smithsonian Institution, and the members came to be at odds with Bass \"on questions of scientific standards,\" and the science committee was dissolved in February 1993. Bass attempted to make Steve Bannon the interim chief executive officer. The existing management, however, refused Bannon admittance to the property, according to an affidavit Bass later submitted to a Fort Worth court, where he filed his dissolution suit.\n\nIn 1995, it was turned into a research facility overseen by Columbia University, which declined to provide funding for continued research after June 2003. In 2007, Bass sold some of the land adjacent to the project, and the building was leased to the University of Arizona. The total cost of the privately funded Biosphere project has been variously reported as $150 million to $200 million. The University of Arizona announced a full acquisition of the Biosphere buildings and grounds in June 2011.\n\nBass has funded numerous projects focused on environmental conservation, and has stated that he feels conservation \"most effective when approached as an enterprise\". His investment in Nepal also included conservation efforts for rhinos and tigers. He has supported and worked with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the New York Botanical Garden, the Jane Goodall Institute, and the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation. He is currently the vice chairman of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas and is the founder of the ecological nonprofit Philecology Trust, which he created in 1986.\n\nBass is a long-time supporter of downtown redevelopment, and has been described as a \"leader in what is recognized as one of the most successful urban revitalization efforts in America\". He and his family began the Sundance Square development in 1982. It combines commercial and residential space in the central business area of Fort Worth, and it received the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce's Spirit of Enterprise award in 2004.

{"id": "2682738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2682738", "title": "European Works Council", "text": "European Works Council\n\nEuropean Works Councils (EWC) are information and consultation bodies representing employees in European multinational companies.\n\nThe rationale behind the establishment of European Works Councils is related to the economic and political integration of the European Union. As companies became more transnational, the local information and consultation bodies (such as works councils) lacked a direct link to the level on which the real decisions are taken. As EWCs bring employee representatives of all over Europe together with the European management, they have an opportunity to be informed and consulted on the transnational companies strategy and status.\n\nEuropean Works Councils are regulated by two European directives. The first EWC directive was adopted in 1994 (94/45/EC) and a revised directive was adopted in 2009 (2009/38/EC). These directives are transposed into national legislation in all European Union and European Economic Area countries.\n\nThe adoption of the EWC Recast Directive came after a long period of discussion on the desirability of giving these councils extra rights and putting an extra burden on companies. In the end, the EWC Recast Directive adopted in 2009 contained some important changes regarding the definitions of information, consultation and transnational issues, included a right to training for employee representative and provided some more requirements for EWC agreements.\n\nEuropean Works Councils can be established in multinationals operative in more than two EEA countries if they pass a certain threshold of number of employees. Currently, the company (or the group of companies) needs to employ at least 1000 employees in the EEA and at least 150 employees in two member states. If a company passes these thresholds, an initiative can be taken by the employer or the employees to establish a European Works Council.\n\nAfter such an initiative, a Special Negotiation Body enters into negotiation on the practicalities of the European Works Council: the composition, the competences, the amount of meeting, the need for translation and interpretation in the meetings and much more. This negotiation results in an EWC agreement which forms the basis for all EWC functioning.\n\nSince the first Directive on European Works Councils was adopted, over a 1000 EWCs have been created. According to estimations, they would cover an estimated amount of 19 million employees in the EEA. Most EWCs are established in companies from the metal, chemical and services industries. Geographically, most EWCs are established in companies headquartered in Germany, the US, France and the UK.\n\nAccording to the EWC Recast Directive, the implementation of the Directive was to be evaluated no later than 5 June 2016. This evaluation was however postponed to the end of 2016 and further postponed to 2017. In the meantime, several evaluation studies have been published from the ETUC, the Leuven University and the ETUI.\n"}

Participants form teams of 3-5 members, and each team is placed in a group of 5-8 teams, depending the competition. The teams are then given a virtual company, initially identical to every other company in the competition. Each team then develops their company by making a series of decisions relating to every aspect of the business, such as how many machines to buy, or how much to spend on advertising. In each round, five sets of decisions are taken, corresponding to five quarters. A quarter is a period said to span three months.\n\nThese decisions - made on the Decision Sheet - are run through sophisticated business simulation software, which generates in-depth Management Reports, showing the consequences of the decisions. The aim is to finish the game with the highest share-price on the virtual stock exchange.\n\nThe competition is divided into rounds with usually 3 or 4 rounds on national level and 2 rounds on international level. The number of national rounds can vary in each country and depends on number of participants. Some countries use slightly different approach and combine Global Management Challenge with other competitions. In India teams compete in another competition which is more sector related (e.g. they run a car manufacturing company) and the last 8 teams join GMC national final. Also in Germany the participants play GMC only in their final round. As it might seem interesting it brings disadvantage to those teams because they are not so familiar with the simulation compared to other teams on the international level.\n\nThe concept of the competition emerged in 1980 in Portugal by SDG – Simuladores e Modelos de Gestão – in partnership with Expresso, a weekly newspaper. The GMC computer model was designed by Edit 515 Limited, registered in Scotland, U.K. It is updated frequently to reflect real world trading conditions and business risks, the aim being to present competitors with very realistic and complex business scenarios, with varied challenges and problems.\n\nThe Global Management Challenge is now the world's biggest strategic management competition - 20000 participants annually. More than 400,000 university students and company managers around the world participated since 1980.\n\nThirty-three countries currently participate in the contest: Angola, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hong Kong SAR (China), Hungary, India, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Macau SAR (China), Mexico, Morocco, People's Republic of China, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and Venezuela.\n\nFor the 2010-2011 session, two new African countries are entering the contest: Ivory Coast, Benin, in partnership with Educarriere.net, a leading website in Ivory Coast which have been famous because it used to publish the result of many exams.\n\nEach country organizes its own National competition, the model producing all material in the language of that country. The winners of the National competition meet to contest the International Semi-Finals and, if successful, go on to compete in the International Final (with results still in each of the countries' native language).\n\nIn 1980—the first year of the competition—only Portuguese teams competed. For the next two years, the GMC winner was decided by a Luso-Brazilian final, between Portugal and Brazil. Brazil won in 1981 and Portugal won in 1982. Since 1983, the winner has been decided at an International Final, hosted by one of the competing countries. The winners of each year's competition are listed below:\n\n"}

He expanded the company from Berlin into Mark Brandenburg and already counted six employees to help with the business. When he was conscripted for military service during the Second World War, Günter Herlitz’s mother took on the running of the business.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the business premises were destroyed by bombs several times, and thus Günter Herlitz resumed business operations in 1945, following completion of his military service, in a basement in the Berlin district of Moabit. Initially selling bargains of all kinds, the Herlitz company was the only one of around 20 Berlin wholesalers to succeed in securing a minimal amount of goods during the Berlin Blockade. When the blockade ended, the company extended its product range considerably. As one of the most important wholesale firms nationwide, Herlitz was able to employ 50 people by 1950.\n\nDue to the political situation in Germany at the time, it became increasingly difficult for the company to get its goods from West Germany to Berlin. As a result, Günter Herlitz decided to manufacture his own stationery. The company began with the production of exercise books, drawing pads and index cards. In 1955, the company was already processing 60 tons of paper each month. Even though the political situation at the time initially prevented Herlitz from supplying customers outside West Berlin, the company was able to boast an annual turnover circa 1.1 million Euro.\n\nInitial attempts to sell the products on the West German market were unsuccessful; however, in 1960, the breakthrough came about with notebooks and drawing pads with illustrated covers, which was an absolute novelty at the time. In the following years, from 1960 to 1994, the company was able to double its turnover each year. This meant an increase in annual turnover from 2 million Euros in 1960 to 885 million Euros in 1994.\n\nIn 1996, Günter Herlitz was honoured for his life’s work at the company’s general meeting and resigned from the board of management. He became the company’s honorary chairman. From then on, he never attended another general meeting of the company.\n\nTo this day, the company headquarters are located in Berlin.\n\nAfter the death of Günter Herlitz in September 2010, his family continues his social commitment and is amongst the most active families in Berlin.

The hotel was named after Henry Roger Wolcott, a businessman, politician and philanthropist.\n\nBefore it was even completed, the building was leased by Dewey to James H. Breslin, a prominent hotelier of the time, for three years. Nonetheless, Dewey had difficulty with the financing for the building: unable to purchase steel locally, he imported it from Europe, which caused an unusually long construction period, which in turn made it difficult for Dewey to pay his creditors.

These incomes were judged greatly excessive by the press, considering the usual Belgian remunerations for the functions of upper management. The lack of transparency was also pointed out, in particular by company's minority shareholders. Facing growing criticism, Jan Coene was forced to resign from both Picanol and Belgacom in October 2004. He accepted to reimburse ten million euros to Picanol (which because of the height of the sums reserved for Jan Coene had become financially unhealthy) but kept 12 million.\n\nThe affair became a political issue in Belgium and a bill was introduced in Parliament (the \"Picanol law\") to force big companies to publish the remuneration of their upper management personnel.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the affair also shed another bad light on the Network of Vlerick-Boys, a circle of business men with low moral standards who all studied at the Vlerick Management School. Members of the circle include Jan Coene, Ronald Everaert, Luc Debruyckere and Louis Verbeke, who were all implied in scandals of greed, mismanagement and fraude (Lernout & Hauspie, Ter Beke, Picanol).

He also served as leader of the liberal party's parliamentary group until 2010, when SZDSZ failed to win any seats after 20 years. Kóka left the party that year. In 2010 he returned to business life and presently works as Chairman and CEO of Cellum Global Zrt. and Chairman of the Board of Cellum Bulgaria.

He continued his studies at Semmelweis University of Medicine, where he received his degree in 1996.\n\nKóka got involved in the emerging Hungarian IT industry while still at university, working as Project Manager and later Sales Director at one of Hungary's first ISPs, Elender LLC from 1994 and 1996. From 1996 he served as Managing Director of Elender Computer LLC, then from 1998, following the company's transformation into a private limited company, as CEO of Elender IT, Inc. In 1999 Elender was acquired by PSINet, Inc. and Kóka became Country Manager, then from 2000 European Vice President of Business Development. He also became Chairman of the Board of Webigen Inc. in July 2000. He returned to his former company in October 2002, serving as CEO of Elender Business Communications. In 2004 he was appointed President of Euroweb Internet Service Provider Inc.\n\nHe was a board member of the ICT Association of Hungary (IVSZ) from 2000, and President from March 2003 until October 2004. From 2003 prior to his ministerial appointment he served as Member of the Board of EICTA (European ICT Association) based in Brussels, and Chairman of the Hungarian-Indonesian Joint Business Council. In 2000 he received the ’IT Manager of the Year’ award founded by the ICT Association of Hungary.\n\nIn October 2004, Kóka was appointed Minister of Economy and Transport, supported by SZDSZ, which he later became a member of in 2006. During this period his main tasks included the development of a business-friendly environment, stimulating the growth of the corporate sector, promoting a knowledge-based economy and increasing the international presence of domestic businesses. In June 2006 he was reappointed Minister of Economy and Transport. Between 2007-2008 he served as President of the Liberal Party, and until 2010 as parliamentary group leader, member of the Budget Committee, and Chairman of the Nabucco Committee aiming to reduce the country's reliance on Russian gas.\n\nHis popularity began to drop in 2006 following the announcement of his Ministry's intention to shut down 14 regional lines of Hungarian State Railways on a total length of . The government, referring to obligation under the constitution, ensured access to public transit in all settlements by installing bus routes and buses from Volán, which, in cases of single railway stations for multiple villages, meant stations in the centers or ends of every settlement.

He considers the most important achievements of his ministerial activities to be the construction of 500 km of motorway, the influx of EUR 4-5 billion of operating capital annually into the country and the commencement of the construction of Megyeri Bridge.\n\nOn March 31, 2008, various reform-related disagreements between the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and SZDSZ led SZDSZ leader Kóka to announce that his party would quit the coalition by May 1, 2008. This also meant that MSZP would have to form the first minority government in Hungary since the political transition in 1990. However, the legitimacy of Kóka's position as party president became questioned when it was discovered that some signatures of the delegates to the assembly electing him had been forged. Since he had won his position by a very small margin over Gábor Fodor, these votes might have changed the outcome. Consequently, a new leadership election was held in June and Gábor Fodor was returned. In 2009, the parliamentary group he led ensured the majority of votes to elect Gordon Bajnai Prime Minister and facilitate the measures taken by the Bajnai Government. He did not run during the parliamentary elections in 2010 and he did not renew his party membership either.\n\nAfter leaving politics in 2010 Kóka returned to the business world. First he was involved in the reorganization of Cellum Group as a consultant, then in 2011 he was appointed Chairman and CEO of Cellum Global Inc., established with the aim of international expansion.\n\nAs the representative of the company, in September 2011, he concluded a venture capital program agreement with Portfolion Zrt., member of OTP Bank Group, and soon afterwards he signed an agreement with Bulgaria's Corpbank on the establishment of a joint technological subsidiary. Since January 2012 he has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors in the Cellum Bulgaria subsidiary, with its head office in Bulgaria.

He is the son of Motown records founder Berry Gordy, the half-brother of singer and rapper Redfoo and Rhonda Ross, daughter of Motown legend Diana Ross.\n\nGordy was born in Detroit, Michigan the same year that his father, Berry Gordy, Jr., founded Motown Records. Gordy was brought home from the hospital to live in the historic home that housed the Hitsville Motown Recording Studios on West Grand Blvd. which was renamed Berry Gordy Jr. Blvd. Gordy’s mother, Raynoma, was a child prodigy in music and played eleven instruments and introduced him to music. Gordy followed in his mother’s footsteps and plays several instruments as well.\n\nGordy lived with his mother until the age of 13 and then moved to Los Angeles with his father Berry. He attended Beverly Hills High School with Benny Medina. Years later Medina created the TV show Fresh Prince of Bel-Air; a semi-autobiographical TV sit com loosely based on Gordy inviting Medina to move into the Gordy Estate in Bel Air when they were teenagers. Later the two wrote and produced records together for Motown and founded a teen idol band called Apollo for the Motown Records label. Teena Marie was originally in the group as the female lead, but dropped out before the band released their first single for Motown entitled \"Astro Disco\".\n\nGordy's career began in 1973 working in the Motown Records mailroom. The early years of his career were spent in various administrative and creative capacities. Then in 1979, he released an album on Motown as a member of the group, Apollo. By the 1980s, he was known professionally as Kerry Ashby to separate himself at Motown from his father. He also worked as a writer and producer for various up and coming artists.\n\nLater Gordy was promoted to the position of Director of A&R, where he worked on projects with artists such as The Temptations, The Four Tops, Rick James and Billy Preston among others. He also worked on compilation albums for Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. He became a Senior Executive for the Gordy Company (his father’s company after selling Motown) in 1988 where he was responsible for supervising Business Affairs, A&R, Product Development, Administration and Personnel. Between 1991 and 1993 Gordy also consulted for Al Bell’s independently distributed label, Bellmark Records. \nIn 1993, Gordy became the Vice President of two divisions for Paisley Park Records, A&R and Artist Development, (a joint venture between Time-Warner and the superstar \"Prince\"). He produced and co-wrote George Clinton’s comeback hit \"Paint the White House Black\" utilizing icons of the rap and rock community such as Platinum artists Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The following year, he orchestrated a joint venture between Prince’s N.P.G. label and Bellmark Records. This union again yielded a world wide # 1 smash single, \"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World.\"\nGordy served as Vice President of A&R for Warner Bros. Records Black Music Division, where in 1995 the R.I.A.A. (Recording Industry Association of America) awarded him with Gold records on Zapp and Roger's \"All the Greatest Hits\" and Prince's \"Come\" Album. His production of \"I’m Looking Out For You,\" was the theme song for \"Real Stories of the Highway Patrol.\" It was broadcast six nights a week in over 190 markets, including CBS in Los Angeles and also aired on the REAL TV Network.\nHe managed Rick James from 1996 until Rick died in 2004. Prior to that, in 1994, Gordy Kerry negotiated and obtained a three-act production deal with Interscope Records joint venture partner B-Rite Records. The first release from that venture (Gospel Gangstaz) enjoyed success.\n\nIn 1998 Gordy partnered with Gordon Bizar under the name Gordy-Bizar to securitize artists' and publishers' royalties. Financing deals were signed with Alice Walton's investment banking firm Llama Company as well as Lehman Brothers.\n\nIn 2003 Gordy signed a deal with Clear Channel Entertainment to produce his company’s first theatrical. He also signed a worldwide deal with the William Morris Agency to be represented in that arena.\nIn 2004 Gordy co-founded Siebers Style with exercise guru Debbie Siebers who earlier that year struck a deal with Beachbody to sell the \"Debbie Siebers Slim in 6\" rapid weight loss program. Debbie also became the fitness expert on the prime time reality show \"The Swan\" on Fox. Gordy negotiated two book deals for Debbie with Silverback Publishing entitled \"Energy Boost\" and \"Nutritional Makeover\". Gordy also started a fifty item clothing line for Debbie in conjunction with the Romar Group.\n\nGordy consults the \"Writers Collective\" and has also consulted for Stevie Wonder.\nIn 2007, Gordy founded Kerry Gordy Enterprises, LLC, an intellectual property and branding company focused in entertainment. He has signed Debbie Siebers, Clark Anderson, and Reggie Benjamin to his company. He also closed a publishing deal for his long-time client, partner, and friend, Bruce Fisher, songwriter of several number one hits including the \"You Are So Beautiful\" with Evergreen Publishing.\nIn 2008, Gordy teamed up with John Davis, to produce two urban genre movies.\n\nIn 2012, Gordy contributed to writing and executive producing on the entire season's episodes of the television series \"The Jadagrace Show\".\n\nThe fourth eldest child of Berry Gordy, Kerry's paternal half-siblings are:\n\nKerry has three maternal half-siblings from his mother Raynoma Mayberry:\n\nKerry has one daughter named Juliet Gordy.\n\nKerry Gordy Joins Top Music Industry Executives who Launch a Clothing Line, for Client Debbie Siebers \n\nKerry Gordy's Client, Debbie Siebers, One of America's Top 12 Fitness Experts of All Time \n\nDebbie Siebers and Kerry Gordy Sign Deal with Romar Group \n\nKerry Gordy Produces George Clinton's Comeback Hit, \"Paint the White House Black\" on the \"Smell My Finger\" Album \n\nPaisley Park Recruits Kerry Gordy to Oversee its Roster \n\nGeorge Clinton Music Video \"Paint the White House Black\", Produced by Kerry Gordy Starring Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Yo Yo, MC Breed and Kam Among Others \n\nKerry Gordy Signs Indian \"King of Pop\", Reggie Benjamin\n\nChemical Engineer Turned Indian Pop Star, Reggie Benjamin Signs with Kerry Gordy Enterprises \n\nManager Kerry Gordy Talks About Rick James Album Plans in 2000 \n\nRick James' Long Time Manager, Kerry Gordy, Talks About the Super Freak After His Death\nTop Warner Bros.

Once admitted to KAIST, Lee transferred to Harvard University and received a B.A. in Economics and Computer Science.\n\nLee interned as South Korean lawmaker Yoo Seong-min's assistant.\n\nIn lieu of military service, he did alternative service at Innotive, an IT firm owned by Nexon, as a junior software engineer. During his service he founded Edushare, a service organization similar to Teach for America to provide academic services to students who are a part of low-income families. Lee first began the organization by an online plea in Seoul Science High Alumni website to recruit volunteers.\n\nIn 2010, he founded ClasseStudio, an online education startup along with the people he met at Innotive.\n\nHandpicked by Rep. Park Geun-hye, the party’s leading presidential candidate, Lee Jun-seok is the youngest ever to hold a leadership position in the history of the conservative ruling party. Being a part of the Leadership Council, Lee's role was to make key decisions on behalf of the party, including the selection of candidates to run in the parliamentary elections in April. Pundits view the appointment to appeal to the younger demographic and counter the surging popularity of Ahn Cheol-soo. Lee's background in computer science and a track record of public service resemble those of Ahn and some see that as the reason for the appointment. Lee remained as a member of Saenuri Party after Park Geun-hye became the President of South Korea.\n\nDuring 2016 South Korean political scandal, Lee harshly criticized the former president Park Geun-hye, whom Lee supported at 18th presidential election. Lee quit Saenuri Party (currently renamed as Liberty Korea Party) and joined Bareun Party with conservative lawmakers who had opposed Park.\n\nLee's background and comments have been reported heavily in the Korean media upon his appointment. Recently he asked the host of \"I'm a Weasel\", a progressive and popular podcast for political satire and criticism of the conservative Grand National Party, for help to investigate the political scandal that is plaguing the Grand National Party. \nKang Yong-suk, a national assemblyman made some attacks on Junseok Lee's qualifications. The critics of the Grand National Party argue that Junseok Lee's old Tweets show his indifference to the average Korean and that he belongs to the upper elite as his Harvard education shows. Lee's tweet that stated \"The National Council of the Victims of Forced Eviction must be mentally retarded\" was viewed as evidence of his indifference and created particularly harsh criticisms.

It is the home of the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. The stadium is immediately adjacent to Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the home of the Baltimore Orioles. Often referred to as \"Ravens Stadium\", M&T Bank Stadium officially opened in 1998, and is currently one of the most praised stadiums in the NFL for fan amenities, ease of access, concessions and other facilities.\n\nThe stadium was originally known as Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards, until PSINet acquired the naming rights in 1999, naming it PSINet Stadium. It then reverted to Ravens Stadium in 2002 when PSINet filed for bankruptcy. The naming rights deal for M&T Bank Stadium was renewed for $60M over 10 years in 2014, extending the name through 2027.\n\nGround was broken for the new stadium in mid-1996, shortly after the arrival of the Ravens. The team played its first two years at Memorial Stadium. Although there was some sentiment from Baltimore residents in having the Ravens stay there permanently, it was deemed too old to host an NFL team. (The Orioles moved away from Memorial Stadium after the 1991 season.)\n\nThe stadium site was previously the site of the Wm. Knabe & Co. piano factory, which closed during The Great Depression. A sidewalk keyboard mosaic on the southwest corner of the stadium honors the company's legacy.\n\nIn 2003, M&T Bank acquired naming rights to the stadium. The bank had recently entered the Baltimore market with its purchase of Allfirst Bank. Two other companies were in the running to be granted naming rights to the stadium; they were reportedly Nextel and CarMax. Following the September 2002 death of Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, public sentiment leaned toward renaming the then-sponsorless stadium after the Baltimore icon. However, the Ravens and the Maryland Stadium Authority held firm in their right to negotiate naming rights fees. In the end, the plaza in front of the main entrance to the Ravens' stadium was named \"Unitas Plaza\", complete with a bronze statue of the Hall of Famer. The plaza formerly featured large banners, each containing a picture of Unitas in his playing days, flanking the stadium entrance. After 10 years, these were replaced by large metal 19s (Unitas's number) for the 2012 season. In 2014, the Ravens unveiled a new statue of long-time Raven Ray Lewis next to Unitas' statue. The bronze figure depicts Lewis in the final pose of his iconic \"squirrel dance\", which he would perform before every Ravens home game upon coming on to the field.\n\nThe stadium contains five levels, being the lower bowl, club level, 300 suites level, 400 suites level, and the upper bowl. The lower bowl contains 42 rows of seats, split into two sections. The seats below the tunnel entrances are labeled from 1 to 18, while the seats above the tunnels are labeled from 19 to 42, except in sections 123-130, which contain rows 19-35, due to the press box taking up sideline space. On the club level, the rows are labeled from 1 to 13 on the sidelines, and 1 to 17 in the corners where no suites are located. In the upper bowl, the sideline seats are labeled from 1 to 32, while in the upper bowl end zones, the rows range from 1 to 26. Seat widths for the lower and upper bowls of the stadium vary from 19 to 21 inches, due to the curve design of the stadium, while the padded club seats range from 21 to 23 inches respectively.\n\nThe venue is served by the Hamburg Street station of the Baltimore Light Rail.\n\nThe stadium originally featured a natural grass surface. However, an artificial surface, Sportexe Momentum Turf, was installed for the 2003 season, which in turn was replaced by a new-generation Sportexe Momentum 51 in 2010. On December 4, 2015, the Ravens announced that in 2016 the team will go back to natural grass playing surface. The listed capacity for M&T Bank Stadium is 71,008.\n\nThe Ravens are the stadium's primary tenants. On December 7, 2008, an M&T Bank Stadium then-record crowd of 71,438 watched the Baltimore Ravens defeat the Washington Redskins 24-10 on \"Sunday Night Football\", only to be surpassed the next week when the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Ravens 13–9 in front of 71,502. On January 15, 2012, a record crowd of 71,547, the largest in Ravens history, was in attendance at the 2011 Divisional Playoff Game in Baltimore against the Houston Texans, which the Ravens won 20–13.\n\nIn 2000, the stadium hosted the Army–Navy Game for the first time and has subsequently hosted the rivalry game in 2007, 2014, and 2016.\n\nIn 2005, the stadium was the site of the first rematch in the Maryland–Navy series known as the \"Crab Bowl Classic\" in 40 years. The two teams played again at M&T Bank Stadium on September 6, 2010 and Maryland won 17–14.\n\nOn October 28, 2006, the stadium held a contest between Notre Dame and Navy in which Notre Dame won 38–14. In 2014, the stadium played host to Ohio State–Navy, Ohio State won 34–17.\n\nIn 2013, the annual rivalry between Maryland and West Virginia was held at the stadium.\n\nOn October 24, 2015, the stadium hosted a Big Ten match-up between Maryland and Penn State in which Maryland lost 31–30.\n\nThe Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA) holds the four state football championships for Maryland's public high schools at M&T Bank Stadium. Two Baltimore high school football rivalry games have been held at the stadium in November. Baltimore City College plays Baltimore Polytechnic Institute every November, in one of the oldest high school football rivalries in the United States. Every Thanksgiving, Loyola Blakefield and Calvert Hall College also square off in what has now been called for many years as the Turkey Bowl, usually reaching up to 13,000 people in the audience. Both games were once played back-to-back on Thanksgiving Day at Memorial Stadium. However, when City College and Polytechnic joined the MPSSAA before 1994 season, the game was forced to be played in early November, due to MPSSAA rules and playoff schedule.\n\nOn July 24, 2009, English Premier League club Chelsea F.C. won 2–1 against Italian Serie A team A.C. Milan in the first World Football Challenge at M&T Bank Stadium in front of a crowd of 71,203. On July 28, 2012 the stadium hosted a match between Premier League teams Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur before 42,723 fans.\n\nThe stadium was a venue for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, drawing a crowd of 70,450 to watch a quarter finals doubleheader between the United States v. El Salvador, and Honduras v. Costa Rica. The 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup had two quarterfinals games at the stadium: United States v. Cuba and Haiti v. Jamaica, played in front of 37,994 spectators.\n\nThe stadium serves as an alternate venue for the Johns Hopkins University men's lacrosse team, and was the site of the semifinals and final of the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship in 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2014. Major League Lacrosse's Baltimore Bayhawks used the stadium as their home during the 2002 season.\n\nPopular music festival HFStival appeared at the stadium in 1999 & 2005, as Foo Fighters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Silverchair, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Offspring, Blink-182, Goo Goo Dolls, Billy Idol, and Coldplay have all played the concert.\n\nMonster Jam was held at the stadium for the first time in 2011, and the stadium has been announced to become a normal stop on the summer tour. Monster Jam returned for the third time on June 8, 2013.\n\nIt served as Nextel Stadium, the home field for the fictional Washington Sentinels in the 2000 film \"The Replacements\". The stadium was also supposed to be the location of the football game in the 2002 film \"The Sum of All Fears\" and included footage of the presidential motorcade going to the building. However, the stadium used for the aerial shots is the domed Olympic Stadium in Montreal, while the book used Denver as the locale for the attack.\n\nIt was featured in \"Stadium,\" a 2013 television public service announcement which was part of the \"I Want To Be Recycled\" advertising campaign for Keep America Beautiful and the Ad Council. The stadium is partially constructed from post-consumer recycled aluminum.\n\n"}

{"id": "38368658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38368658", "title": "Profit model", "text": "Profit model\n\nThe profit model is the linear, deterministic algebraic model used implicitly by most cost accountants. Starting with, profit equals sales minus costs, it provides a structure for modeling cost elements such as materials, losses, multi-products, learning, depreciation etc. It provides a mutable conceptual base for spreadsheet modelers. This enables them to run deterministic simulations or 'what if' modelling to see the impact of price, cost or quantity changes on profitability.\n\nwhere:\n\nFor an expansion of the model see below.\n\nThe justification for wanting to express profit as an algebraic model is given by Mattessich in 1961:\n\nMost of the definitions in cost accounting are in an unclear narrative form, not readily associated with other definitions of accounting calculations. For example, preparing a comparison of fixed cost variances in stock under different stock valuation methods can be confusing. Another example is modelling labour variances with learning curve corrections and stock level changes. With the absence of a basic profit model in an algebraic form, confident development of such models is difficult.\n\nThe development of spreadsheets has led to a decentralisation of financial modelling. This has often resulted in model builders lacking training in model construction. Before any professional model is built it is usually considered wise to start by developing a mathematical model for analysis. The profit model provides a general framework plus some specific examples of how such an a priori profit model might be constructed.\n\nThe presentation of a profit model in an algebraic form is not new. Mattessich's model, while large, does not include many costing techniques such as learning curves and different stock valuation methods. Also, it was not presented in a form that most accountants were willing or able to read. This paper presents a more extended model analysing profit but it does not, unlike Mattessich, extend to the balance sheet model. Its form, of starting with the basic definition of profit and becoming more elaborate, may make it more accessible to accountants.\n\nMost cost accounting textbooks explain basic Cost Volume Profit modeling in an algebraic form, but then revert to an 'illustrative' approach. This 'illustrative' approach uses examples or narrative to explain management accounting procedures. This format, though useful when communicating with humans, can be difficult to translate into an algebraic form, suitable for computer model building. Mepham extended the algebraic, or deductive, approach to cost accounting to cover many more techniques. He develops his model to integrate with the optimizing models in operations research. The profit model comes out of Mephams work, extending it but only in a descriptive, linear form.\n\nThe basic profit model is sales minus costs. Sales are made up of quantity sold multiplied by their price. Costs are usually divided between Fixed costs and variable costs.\n\nUsing:\n\nThus the profit can be calculated from:\n\nNotice that \"w\" (average unit production cost) includes the fixed and variable costs.\nThe square brackets contain the cost of goods sold, \"wq\" not cost of good made \"wx\" where \"x\" = cost of good sold.\n\nTo show cost of good sold, the opening and closing finished goods stocks need to be included\nThe profit model would then be:\n\n\nPresenting the profit calculation in this form immediately demands that some of the costs be more carefully defined.\n\nThe unit production costs (\"w\") can be separated into fixed and variable costs:\n\nwhere\n\n\nThe introduction of this separation of \"w\" allows for consideration of the behaviour of costs for different levels of production. A linear cost curve is assumed here, divided between the constant (\"F\") and its slope (\"v\"). If the modeller has access to the details of non-linear cost curves then \"w\" will need to be defined by the appropriate function.\n\nReplacing \"wx\" in (equation 2) and making \"F\" = \"F\" + \"F\":\n\nMoving on to other extensions of the basic model, the cost elements such as direct materials, direct labour and variable overheads can be included. If a non-linear function is available and thought useful such functions can be substituted for the functions used here.\n\nThe material cost of sales = m * µ * q, where\n\nm is the amount of material in one unit of finished goods.\n\nµ is the cost per unit of the raw material.\n\nThe labour cost of sales = \"l λ q\", where\n\n\nThe variable overhead cost of sales = \"nq\" where \"n\" is the variable overhead cost per unit.\n\nThis is not here subdivided between quantity per finished goods units and cost per unit.\n\nThus the variable cost v * q can now be elaborated into:\n\nIf the production quantity is required the finished goods stock will need to be added.\n\nIn a simple case two materials can be accommodated in the model by simply adding another m * µ. In more realistic situations a matrix and a vector will be necessary (see later).\n\nIf material cost of purchases is to be used rather than material cost of production it will be necessary to adjust for material stocks. That is,\n\nwhere \n\nAll depreciation rules can be stated as equations representing their curve over time. The reducing balance method provides one of the more interesting examples.\n\nUsing c = cost, t = time, L = life, s = scrap value, Fd = time based depreciation:\n\nThis equation is better known as the rule: Depreciation per year = Last year's written down value multiplied by a constant %\n\nThe limits are 0 < t < L, and the scrap value has to be greater than zero. (For zero use 0.1).\n\nRemembering that time-based depreciation is a fixed cost and usage-based depreciation can be a variable cost, depreciation can easily be added into the model (equation 5).\n\nThus, the profit model becomes:\n\nwhere, nd = usage (as q) based depreciation and π = annual profit.\n\nIn the above, the value of the unit finished goods cost ‘w' was left undefined. There are numerous alternatives to how stock (w) is valued but only two will be compared here.\n\nThe marginal versus absorption costing debate, includes the question of the valuation of stock (w).\n\nShould w = v or as (3) w = (Fm + v x)/x.\n\n(i) Under marginal costing: w = v. Inserting in (4),\n\nBecomes\n\nThis can be simplified by taking v out and noting, opening stock quantity + production - closing stock quantity = sales quantity (q) so,\n\nNote, v q = variable cost of goods sold.\n\n(ii) Using full (absorption) costing\nUsing (equation 3), where xp = planned production, x1 = period production\nw = (Fm + v xp)/xp = Fm/xp + v.\nThis can be shown to result in:\n\nNote the strange presence of 'x' in the model.\nNotice also that the absorption model (equation 10) is the same as the marginal costing model (equation 9) except for the end part:\n\nThis part represents the fixed costs in stock. This is better seen by remem¬bering q — x= go—g1 so it could be written\n\nThe model form with 'q' and 'x' in place of' g and g allows profits to be calculated when only the sales and production figures are known.\n\nA spreadsheet could be prepared for a company with increasing then decreasing levels of sales and constant production. It could have another column showing profit under increasing sales and constant production. Thus the effects of carrying fixed costs in stock can be simulated. Such modelling thus provides a very useful tool in the marginal versus full costing debate.\n\nOne way of modeling for losses is to use: \n\nThe model, with all these losses together will look like,\n\nNote that labour and variable overhead losses could also have been included.\n\nSo far the model has assumed very few products and/or cost elements. As many firms are multi-product the model they use must be able to handle this problem. Whilst the mathematics here is straightforward the accounting problems introduced are enormous: the cost allocation problem being a good example. Other examples include calculation of break-even points, productivity measures and the optimisation of limited resources. Here only the mechanics of building a multi-dimension model will be outlined.\n\nIf a firm sells two products (a and b) then the profit model (equation 9),\n\nAll fixed costs have been combined in F\n\nTherefore, for multiple products\n\nWhere Σ = the sum of. Which can be drafted as a vector or matrix in a spreadsheet\n\nor\n\nThe profit model may represent actual data (c), planned data (p)or standard data (s) which is the actual sales quantities at the planned costs.\n\nThe actual data model will be (using equation 8):\n\nThe planned data model will be (using equation 8):\n\nThe standard data model will be (using equation 8):\n\nOperating variances are obtained by subtracting the actual model from the standard model.\n\nIt is possible to add non linear cost curves to the Profit model. For example, if with learning, the labour time per unit will decrease exponentially over time as more product is made, then the time per unit is:\n\nwhere \nr = average time. \nb = learning rate.\nq = quantity.\n\nInserting into equation 8\n\nThis equation is best solved by trial and error, the Newton Raphson method or graphing. Like depreciation within the model, the adjustment for learning does provide a form of non-linear sub-modelling.\n\nRather than the variable be absolute amounts, they might be percentage changes. This represents a major change in approach from the model above. The model is often used in the 'now that ... (say) the cost of labour has gone up by 10%' format. If a model can be developed that only uses such percentage changes then the cost of collecting absolute quantities will be saved.\n\nThe notation used below is of attaching a % sign to variables to indicate the change of that variable, for example, p% = 0.10 if the selling price is assumed to change by 10%,\n\nLet x = q and C = contribution\n\nStarting with the absolute form of the contribution model (equation (9) rearranged):\n\nThe increase in the contribution which results from an increase in p, v and/or q can be calculated thus:\n\nrearranging and using α = (p — v)/p,\n\nThis model might look messy but it is very powerful. It makes very few demands on data, especially if some of the variables do not change. It is possible to develop most of the models presented above in this percentage change format.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2070495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2070495", "title": "Vorstand", "text": "Vorstand\n\nIn German corporate governance, a Vorstand is the executive board of a corporation (public limited company). It is hierarchically subordinate to the supervisory board (\"Aufsichtsrat\"), as German company law imposes a two-tier board of directors.\n\nGerman law confers executive powers on the executive board as a body. It is expected to act collectively and collegially. Unlike the executive committee (\"aka\" operating committee or executive council) of a US or UK company, the executive board is not an adjunct of the CEO (managing director). In contrast to Japanese corporate governance, the German executive board has real decision-making power. It is, by law, the managing body of a company and cannot be instructed by any legal person, be they natural or artificial, to act in such a way as to harm the business. Executive board members are personally liable for accepting any such instructions.\n\nThe specific scope of an executive board's duties varies from business to business. (A group of companies may each have their own individual executive boards, for example). The president of the executive board (i.e., the CEO) and the position's role are determined by the supervisory board. German law permits, but does not require, executive board members to elect a president/CEO from among their number. There are no specific legal requirements regarding the CEO's role, or even for the title given to the holder of the CEO position, although in practice the most common title is simply \"Vorstandsvorsitzender\", literally, \"\"Vorstand\" chairman\". A noticeable minority refer to their CEOs as \"Sprecher\" (lit., \"speaker\"), implying that the CEO is no more than \"primus inter pares\"; probably the best-known example for a company which uses this terminology is Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe exact relationship between the CEO and the other executive officers depends on the company's type, how it was founded, and indeed the individual personalities of the people involved. A family business could, for example, have a strong CEO who is a member of the founding family and exercises a great deal of power over the rest of the board. In other companies, executive officers may hold themselves accountable to the executive board as a whole and not at all accountable to the CEO as an individual.\n\nThe relationships among executive officers can vary too. It is common practice for board members to be senior executives with specific areas of functional responsibility. However, the law requires that they oversee the activities of their fellow officers, since they are still personally liable for any failings outside their specific departments/subdivisions. Each board member has one vote. Decisions are \"never\" escalated, when there is a lack of consensus, to the supervisory board. Executive board meetings are commonly held on a weekly basis and can last up to a whole day.\n\nFormally, the power to appoint executive officers to the board lies with the supervisory board, which can appoint officers with a two-thirds majority vote of approval, or a simple majority if multiple rounds of voting are required in order to reach a decision. Since up to 50% of the supervisory board members are delegates of the employees (or even external trade union representatives, for details see Mitbestimmung), this prevents employees from blocking the appointment of executive officers to the executive board.\n\nExecutive officers have a certain degree of job security, which is partly a preventative measure aimed at ensuring that executive boards are not dominated and that they are not \"packed\" with hand-picked appointees. Officers are usually appointed for the maximum statutory term—5 years. Removal must be for good cause, such as serious breach of duty, and is subject to the supervisory board's veto. When an executive officer's ability to perform his duties is diminished due to old age, it is customary for him to serve out the remainder of his term but with a deputy to help perform his duties. Neither the shareholders nor the executive board can compel an officer to retire, whereas the supervisory board can.\n\nCommonly, the CEO receives between 30% and 50% greater salary than that of the other executive officers. An officer's remuneration usually comprises 65% basic salary, and 35% that is equally split between annual bonuses and benefits.\n"}

Welfare capitalism is also the practice of businesses providing welfare services to their employees. Welfare capitalism in this second sense, or industrial paternalism, was centered on industries that employed skilled labor and peaked in the mid-20th century.\n\nToday, welfare capitalism is most often associated with the models of capitalism found in Central Mainland and Northern Europe, such as the Nordic model, social market economy and Rhine capitalism. In some cases welfare capitalism exists within a mixed economy, but welfare states can and do exist independently of policies common to mixed economies such as state interventionism and extensive regulation.\n\n\"Welfare capitalism\" or \"welfare corporatism\" is somewhat neutral language for what, in other contexts, might be framed as \"industrial paternalism\", \"industrial village\", \"company town\", \"representative plan\", \"industrial betterment\", or \"company union\".\n\nIn the 19th century, some companies—mostly manufacturers—began offering new benefits for their employees. This began in Britain in the early 19th century and also occurred in other European countries, including France and Germany. These companies sponsored sports teams, established social clubs, and provided educational and cultural activities for workers. Some offered housing as well. Welfare corporatism in the United States developed during the intense industrial development of 1880 to 1900 which was marked by labor disputes and strikes, many violent.\n\nOne of the first attempts at offering philanthropic welfare to workers was made at the New Lanark mills in Scotland by the social reformer Robert Owen. He became manager and part owner of the mills in 1810, and encouraged by his success in the management of cotton mills in Manchester (see also Quarry Bank Mill), he hoped to conduct New Lanark on higher principles and focus less on commercial profit. The general condition of the people was very unsatisfactory. Many of the workers were steeped in theft and drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected and most families lived in one room. The respectable country people refused to submit to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills. Many employers also operated the truck system, whereby payment to the workers was made in part or totally by tokens. These tokens had no value outside the mill owner's \"truck shop\". The owners were able to supply shoddy goods to the truck shop and charge top prices. A series of \"Truck Acts\" (1831–1887) eventually stopped this abuse, by making it an offence not to pay employees in common currency.\n\nOwen opened a store where the people could buy goods of sound quality at little more than wholesale cost, and he placed the sale of alcohol under strict supervision. He sold quality goods and passed on the savings from the bulk purchase of goods to the workers. These principles became the basis for the cooperative stores in Britain that continue to trade today. Owen's schemes involved considerable expense, which displeased his partners. Tired of the restrictions on his actions, Owen bought them out in 1813. New Lanark soon became celebrated throughout Europe, with many leading royals, statesmen and reformers visiting the mills. They were astonished to find a clean, healthy industrial environment with a content, vibrant workforce and a prosperous, viable business venture all rolled into one. Owen’s philosophy was contrary to contemporary thinking, but he was able to demonstrate that it was not necessary for an industrial enterprise to treat its workers badly to be profitable. Owen was able to show visitors the village’s excellent housing and amenities, and the accounts showing the profitability of the mills.\n\nOwen and the French socialist Henri de Saint-Simon were the fathers of the utopian socialist movement; they believed that the ills of industrial work relations could be removed by the establishment of small cooperative communities. Boarding houses were built near the factories for the workers' accommodation. These so-called model villages were envisioned as a self-contained community for the factory workers. Although the villages were located close to industrial sites, they were generally physically separated from them and generally consisted of relatively high quality housing, with integrated community amenities and attractive physical environments.\n\nThe first such villages were built in the late 18th century, and they proliferated in England in the early 19th century with the establishment of Trowse, Norfolk in 1805 and Blaise Hamlet, Bristol in 1811. In America, boarding houses were built for textile workers in Lowell, Massachusetts in the 1820s. The motive behind these offerings was paternalistic—owners were providing for workers in ways they felt was good for them. These programs did not address the problems of long work hours, unsafe conditions, and employment insecurity that plagued industrial workers during that period, however. Indeed, employers who provided housing in company towns (communities established by employers where stores and housing were run by companies) often faced resentment from workers who chafed at the control owners had over their housing and commercial opportunities. A noted example was Pullman, Illinois—a site of a strike that destroyed the town in 1894. During these years, disputes between employers and workers often turned violent and led to government intervention.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, however, business leaders began embracing a different approach. The Cadbury family of philanthropists and business entrepreneurs set up the model village at Bournville, England in 1879 for their chocolate making factory. Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury pioneered pension schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service. By 1900, the estate included 313 'Arts and Crafts' cottages and houses; traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, they were designed by the resident architect William Alexander Harvey.\n\nThe Cadburys were also concerned with the health and fitness of their workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans and encouraging swimming, walking and indeed all forms of outdoor sports. In the early 1920s, extensive football and hockey pitches were opened together with a grassed running track. Rowheath Pavilion served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields, several bowling greens, a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming lido, a natural mineral spring forming the source for the lido's healthy waters. The whole area was specifically for the benefit of the Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families.\nPort Sunlight in Wirral, England was built by the Lever Brothers to accommodate workers in its soap factory in 1888. By 1914, the model village could house a population of 3,500. The garden village had allotments and public buildings including the Lady Lever Art Gallery, a cottage hospital, schools, a concert hall, open air swimming pool, church, and a temperance hotel. Lever introduced welfare schemes, and provided for the education and entertainment of his workforce, encouraging recreation and organisations which promoted art, literature, science or music.\n\nLever's aims were \"to socialise and Christianise business relations and get back to that close family brotherhood that existed in the good old days of hand labour.\" He claimed that Port Sunlight was an exercise in profit sharing, but rather than share profits directly, he invested them in the village. He said, \"It would not do you much good if you send it down your throats in the form of bottles of whisky, bags of sweets, or fat geese at Christmas. On the other hand, if you leave the money with me, I shall use it to provide for you everything that makes life pleasant—nice houses, comfortable homes, and healthy recreation.\"\nIn America in the early 20th century, businessmen like George F. Johnson and Henry B. Endicott began to seek new relations with their labor by offering the workers wage incentives and other benefits. The point was to increase productivity by creating good will with employees. When Henry Ford introduced his $5-a-day pay rate in 1914 (when most workers made $11 a week), his goal was to reduce turnover and build a long-term loyal labor force that would have higher productivity. Turnover in manufacturing plants in the U.S. from 1910 to 1919 averaged 100%. Wage incentives and internal promotion opportunities were intended to encourage good attendance and loyalty. This would reduce turnover and improve productivity. The combination of high pay, high efficiency and cheap consumer goods was known as Fordism, and was widely discussed throughout the world.\n\nLed by the railroads and the largest industrial corporations such as the Pullman Car Company, Standard Oil, International Harvester, Ford Motor Company and United States Steel, businesses provided numerous services to its employees, including paid vacations, medical benefits, pensions, recreational facilities, sex education and the like. The railroads, in order to provide places for itinerant trainmen to rest, strongly supported YMCA hotels, and built railroad YMCAs. The Pullman Car Company build an entire model town, Pullman, Illinois. The Seaside Institute is an example of a social club built for the particular benefit of women workers. Most of these programs proliferated after World War I—in the 1920s.\n\nThe economic upheaval of the Great Depression in the 1930s brought many of these programs to a halt. Employers cut cultural activities and stopped building recreational facilities as they struggled to stay solvent. It wasn't until after World War II that many of these programs reappeared—and expanded to include more blue-collar workers. Since this time, programs like on-site child care and substance abuse treatment have waxed and waned in use/popularity, but other welfare capitalism components remain. Indeed, in the U.S., the health care system is largely built around employer-sponsored plans.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Germany and Britain created \"safety nets\" for their citizens, including public welfare and unemployment insurance. These government operated welfare systems is the sense in which the term 'welfare capitalism' is generally understood today.\n\nThe 19th century German economist, Gustav von Schmoller, defined welfare capitalism as government provision for the welfare of workers and the public via social legislation. Western Europe, Scandinavia, Canada and Australasia are regions noted for their welfare state provisions, though other countries have publicly financed universal healthcare and other elements of the welfare state as well.\nEsping-Andersen categorised three different traditions of welfare provision in his 1990 book 'The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism'; Social Democracy, Christian Democracy (conservatism) and Liberalism. Though increasingly criticised, these classifications remain the most commonly used in distinguishing types of modern welfare states, and offer a solid starting point in such analysis. It has been argued that these typologies remain a fundamental heuristic tool for welfare state scholars, even for those who claim that in-depth analysis of a single case is more suited to capture the complexity of different social policy arrangements. Welfare typologies have the function to provide a comparative lens and place even the single case into a comparative perspective (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2011).\n\nThe ideal Social-Democratic welfare state is based on the principle of universalism granting access to benefits and services based on citizenship. Such a welfare state is said to provide a relatively high degree of autonomy, limiting the reliance of family and market (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2011). In this context, social policies are perceived as 'politics against the market' (Esping-Andersen 1985). Christian-democratic welfare states are based on the principle of subsidiarity and the dominance of social insurance schemes, offering a medium level of decommodification and a high degree of social stratification. The liberal regime is based on the notion of market dominance and private provision; ideally, the state only interferes to ameliorate poverty and provide for basic needs, largely on a means-tested basis. Hence, the decommodification potential of state benefits is assumed to be low and social stratification high (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2011).\n\nBased on the decommodification index Esping-Andersen divided into the following regimes 18 OECD countries (Esping-Andersen 1990: 71):\n\n\nThese 18 countries can be placed on a continuum from the most purely social-democratic, Sweden, to the most liberal country, the United States (Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser 2011).\n\nEuropean welfare capitalism is typically endorsed by Christian democrats and social democrats. In contrast to social welfare provisions found in other industrialized countries (especially countries with the Anglo-Saxon model of capitalism), European welfare states provide universal services that benefit all citizens (social democratic welfare state) as opposed to a minimalist model that only caters to the needs of the poor.\n\nIn Northern European countries, welfare capitalism is often combined with social corporatism and national-level collective bargaining arrangements aimed at balancing the power between labor and business. The most prominent example of this system is the Nordic model, which features free and open markets with limited regulation, high concentrations of private ownership in industry, and tax-funded universal welfare benefits for all citizens.\n\nAn alternative model of welfare exists in Continental European countries, known as the social market economy or German model, which includes a greater role for government interventionism into the macro-economy but features a less generous welfare state than is found in the Nordic countries.\n\nIn France, the welfare state exists alongside a dirigiste mixed economy.\n\nWelfare capitalism in the United States refers to industrial relations policies of large, usually non-unionised, companies that have developed internal welfare systems for their employees. Welfare capitalism first developed in the United States in the 1880s and gained prominence in the 1920s.\n\nPromoted by business leaders during a period marked by widespread economic insecurity, social reform activism, and labor unrest, it was based on the idea that Americans should look not to the government or to labor unions but to the workplace benefits provided by private-sector employers for protection against the fluctuations of the market economy. Companies employed these types of welfare policies to encourage worker loyalty, productivity and dedication. Owners feared government intrusion in the Progressive Era, and labor uprisings from 1917 to 1919—including strikes against \"benevolent\" employers—showed the limits of paternalistic efforts. For owners, the corporation was the most responsible social institution and it was better suited, in their minds, to promoting the welfare of employees than government. Welfare capitalism was their way of heading off radicalism and regulation then.\n\nThe benefits offered by welfare capitalist employers were often inconsistent and varied widely from firm to firm. They included minimal benefits such as cafeteria plans, company-sponsored sports teams, lunchrooms and water fountains in plants, and company newsletters/magazines—as well as more extensive plans providing retirement benefits, health care, and employee profit-sharing. Examples of companies that have practiced welfare capitalism include Kodak, Sears, and IBM, with the main elements of the employment system in these companies including permanent employment, internal labor markets, extensive security and fringe benefits, and sophisticated communications and employee involvement.\n\nWelfare capitalism was also used as a way to resist government regulation of markets, independent labor union organizing, and the emergence of a welfare state. Welfare capitalists went to great lengths to quash independent trade union organizing, strikes, and other expressions of labor collectivism—through a combination of violent suppression, worker sanctions, and benefits in exchange for loyalty. Also, employee stock-ownership programs meant to tie workers to the success of companies (and accordingly to management). Workers would then be actual partners with owners—and capitalists themselves. Owners intended these programs to ward off the threat of \"Bolshevism\" and undermine the appeal of unions.\n\nThe least popular of the welfare capitalism programs were the company unions created to stave off labor activism. By offering employees a say in company policies and practices and a means for appealing disputes internally, employers hoped to reduce the lure of unions. They dubbed these employee representation plans \"industrial democracy.\"\n\nIn the end, welfare capitalism programs benefited white-collar workers far more than those on the factory floor in the early 20th century. The average annual bonus payouts at U.S. Steel Corporation from 1929 to 1931 were approximately $2,500,000; however, in 1929, $1,623,753 of that went to the president of the company. Real wages for unskilled and low-skilled workers grew little in the 1920s, while long hours in unsafe conditions continued to be the norm. Further, employment instability due to layoffs remained a reality of work life. Welfare capitalism programs rarely worked as intended, company unions only reinforced that authority of management over the terms of employment.\n\nWage incentives (merit raises and bonuses) often led to a speed-up in production for factory lines. As much as these programs meant to encourage loyalty to the company, this effort was often undermined by continued layoffs and frustrations with working conditions. Employees soured on employee representation plans and cultural activities, but they were eager for opportunities to improve their pay with good work and attendance and to gain benefits like medical care. These programs gave workers new expectations for their employers. They were often disappointed in the execution of them but supported their aims. The post-World War II era saw an expansion of these programs for all workers, and today, these benefits remain part of employment relations in many countries. Recently, however, there has been a trend away from this form of welfare capitalism, as corporations have reduced the portion of compensation paid with health care, and shifted from defined benefit pensions to employee-funded defined contribution plans.\n\n\n"}
