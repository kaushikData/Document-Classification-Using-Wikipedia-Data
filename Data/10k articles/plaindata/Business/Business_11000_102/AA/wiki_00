The bill would \"amend the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) to deny the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board any authority to require that audits conducted for a particular issuer of securities in accordance with SOX standards be conducted by specific auditors, or that such audits be conducted for an issuer by different auditors on a rotating basis,\" according to a summary by the Congressional Research Service. The bill passed the House 321-62 on July 8, 2013.\n\nIn 2011, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) asked for public comments on a concept release they made about whether auditor term limits and rotations would actually improve auditor independence. As of June 2013, the PCAOB had not decided whether to move forward with the concept or abandon it.\n\n\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.\"\n\nThe Audit Integrity and Job Protection Act would amend the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) to deny the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board any authority to require that audits conducted for a particular issuer of securities in accordance with SOX standards be conducted by specific auditors, or that such audits be conducted for an issuer by different auditors on a rotating basis.\n\nH.R. 1564 would prohibit the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) from requiring public companies to use a specific auditor or to use different auditors on a rotating basis. The bill also would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to update a report completed in 2003 that reviewed the potential effects of mandatory rotation for auditing firms.\n\nBased on information from the PCAOB, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 1564 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. The PCAOB has no immediate plans to issue a ruling specifying how public companies should choose a financial auditor; therefore, the prohibition in H.R. 1564 would not change its workload. Based on information about similar reporting efforts, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1564 would have a discretionary cost of about $1 million for the GAO to complete the required study and report.\n\nH.R. 1564 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.\n\nThe Audit Integrity and Job Protection Act was introduced into the House on April 15, 2013 by Rep. Robert Hurt (R-VA). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Financial Services and the United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. It was reported alongside House Report 113-142. On July 8, 2013, the House voted 321-62 to pass H.R. 1564 in Roll Call Vote 306.\n\nThe Audit Integrity and Job Protection Act was received in the United States Senate on July 9, 2013 and referred to the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\nLawmakers in favor of the bill argued that the bill is necessary because mandatory auditor rotations would be an expensive burden on businesses, cause significant disruptions, and would be generally \"unworkable\" due to the small number of auditing firms. Business groups also agreed that mandatory auditor rotations were a poor idea, since it would take time for the new auditor to learn the details of the business they were newly assigned to audit, lowering the quality of the audit.\n\nOpponents of the bill argued that the current audit system has clear flaws that are not being addressed - that many public companies have long-term, close relationships with the firms that are supposed to be holding them accountable.\n\n\n"}

Affleck\n\nBenjamin Franklin \"Ben\" Affleck (March 1, 1869 – February 13, 1944) was an American cement businessman in the Chicago, Illinois area. He was noted by colleagues and area residents for his rise from humble beginnings as a machinist to the head of sales and later the presidency of the Universal Portland Cement Company. \n\nBorn in Belleville, Illinois, Affleck was educated in the public schools there. He did not have much formal higher educational background; one co-industrialist described him as having learned his trade in the \"school of hard knocks\". As a young man, he spent four years working for the Harrison Machine Works company in his home town, leaving afterwards to work for American Express. In 1890, at the age of 21, he joined the Alton Terre Haute Railroad where he worked until 1896, before taking a position at the Illinois Steel Company. He was hired initially as a machinist, but rose to the position of sales manager in the cement department with his knack for bringing in profits and business acumen. In 1906, the Illinois Steel Company spun off their cement department, incorporating it as the Universal Portland Cement Company; Affleck continued as sales manager of the new company until 1915, when he became its president.\n\nOn March 2, 1921, Affleck and thirty-nine other officers of cement corporations were indicted by a federal grand jury under the Sherman Antitrust Act for restraint of trade and attempts at monopoly. The companies involved were alleged to have tightly controlled the supply of cement, refusing to sell any builder more than the amount needed for a single job, and preventing them from using any unexpected surplus on other jobs; prices quoted on cement were invariably the same to the penny.\n\nAffleck became president of the Universal Atlas Cement Company after its merger with the Universal Portland Cement Company in January 1930; however, he retired from the position just six years later, in 1936.\n\nAffleck lived in Winnetka, a middle-class suburb, for some time; by the 1920s, he was well-off enough financially to move to Lake Forest. He had one daughter, Mildred, with his wife, Rene Mansfield of Oshkosh, Wisconsin; Mildred married Victor Spoehr of Winnetka in October 1923. Affleck served as trustee of a number of local institutions, including the Field Museum of Natural History, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Chicago Association of Commerce, while his wife was active in the Alliance française and the Chicago Woman's Musical \nClub. The Union League Club elected him their president in 1928. Around that time, he also founded the Chicago Benjamin Franklins, an association of people with the given name Benjamin Franklin; they often held events in honor of the most famous Ben Franklin. He also belonged to a number of industry associations, including the American Concrete Institute.\n\nAffleck later moved back to Winnetka, where he would remain until his death. On February 13, 1944, he died while shoveling snow off the walk outside of his home. After his death, it came to light that, despite his illustrious career, his estate was worth much less than previously believed, possibly as little as $20,000. A steamer of the United States Steel Corporation was named in his honor. His grandson, Peter Adams Spoehr, went on to attend Hamilton College and married Sally Rambeau of Bronxville, New York on December 1, 1956 in her hometown; the elder Spoehr was already deceased by then.\n\n"}

She was convicted of horse theft in 1883. She was fatally shot in 1889 in a case that is still officially unsolved. Her story was popularized by Richard K. Fox—editor and publisher of the \"National Police Gazette\"—and she later became a popular character in television and movies.\n\nBelle Starr was born Myra Maybelle Shirley on her father's farm near Carthage, Missouri, on February 5, 1848. Most of her family members called her May. Her father, John Shirley, prospered raising wheat, corn, hogs and horses, though he was considered to be the \"black sheep\" of a well-to-do Virginia family which had moved west to Indiana, where he married and divorced twice. Her mother, Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Hatfield Shirley, was John Shirley's third wife and a distant relative to the Hatfields of the famous family feud. In the 1860s, her father sold the farm and moved the family to Carthage, where he bought an inn, livery stable and blacksmith shop on the town square.\n\nMay Shirley received a classical education and learned piano, while graduating from Missouri's Carthage Female Academy, a private institution that her father had helped to found.\n\nAfter a Union attack on Carthage in 1864, the Shirleys moved to Scyene, Texas. According to legend, it was at Scyene that the Shirleys became associated with a number of Missouri-born criminals, including Jesse James and the Youngers. In fact, she knew the Younger brothers and the James boys because she had grown up with them in Missouri. Her brother, John A. M. \"Bud\" Shirley, was called Captain Shirley by local Confederate sympathizers. He does not appear on any list of Quantrill's Raiders, but rode with a group who were called partisans by some and bushwackers by Union sympathizers. Bud Shirley was killed in 1864 in Sarcoxie, Missouri, while he and another scout were eating at the home of a Confederate sympathizer. Union troops surrounded the house and when Bud attempted to escape, he was shot and killed.\n\nFollowing the war, the Reed family also moved to Scyene and May Shirley married Jim Reed in 1866, after having had an earlier crush on him as a teen. Two years later, she gave birth to her first child, Rosie Lee (nicknamed Pearl). Belle always harbored a strong sense of style, which would feed into her later legend. A crack shot, she used to ride sidesaddle while dressed in a black velvet riding habit and a plumed hat, carrying two pistols, with cartridge belts across her hips. Jim turned to crime and was wanted for murder in Arkansas, which caused the family to move to California, where their second child, James Edwin (Eddie), was born in 1871.\n\nLater returning to Texas, Jim Reed was involved with several criminal gangs. While Jim initially tried his hand at farming, he would grow restless and fell in with bad company—the Starr clan, a Cherokee Indian family notorious for whiskey, cattle, and horse thievery in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), as well as his wife's old friends the James and Younger gangs. In April 1874, despite a lack of any evidence, a warrant was issued for her arrest for a stagecoach robbery by her husband and others. Jim Reed was killed in August of that year in Paris, Texas, where he had settled down with his family.\n\nAllegedly, Belle was briefly married for three weeks to Charles Younger, uncle of Cole Younger in 1878, but this is not substantiated by any evidence. There are numerous claims that Belle's daughter Pearl Reed was actually Pearl Younger, but in Cole Younger's own biography (quoted in Glen Shirley's \"Belle Starr and her times\") Cole Younger discounted that as rubbish and set down what he truly knew of Belle. In 1880 she did marry a Cherokee man named Sam Starr and settled with the Starr family in the Indian Territory. There, she learned ways of organizing, planning and fencing for the rustlers, horse thieves and bootleggers, as well as harboring them from the law. Belle's illegal enterprises proved lucrative enough for her to employ bribery to free her cohorts from the law whenever they were caught.\n\nIn 1883, Belle and Sam were arrested by Bass Reeves charged with horse theft and tried before \"The Hanging Judge\" Isaac Parker's Federal District Court in Fort Smith, Arkansas; the prosecutor was United States Attorney W. H. H. Clayton. She was found guilty and served nine months at the Detroit House of Corrections in Detroit, Michigan. Belle proved to be a model prisoner and during her time in jail she won the respect of the prison matron, while Sam was more incorrigible and was assigned to hard labor.\n\nIn 1886, she escaped conviction on another theft charge, but on December 17, Sam Starr was involved in a gunfight with Officer Frank West. Both men were killed, while Belle's life as an outlaw queen—and what had been the happiest relationship of her life—abruptly ended with her husband's death.\n\nFor the last two-plus years of her life, gossips and scandal sheets linked her to a series of men with colorful names, including Jack Spaniard, Jim French and Blue Duck, after which, in order to keep her residence on Indian land, she married a relative of Sam Starr, Jim July Starr, who was some 15 years younger than she was.\n\nOn February 3, 1889, two days before her 41st birthday, she was killed. She was riding home from a neighbor's house in Eufaula, Oklahoma, when she was ambushed. After she fell off her horse, she was shot again to make sure she was dead. Her death resulted from shotgun wounds to the back and neck and in the shoulder and face. Legend says she was shot with her own double barrel shotgun.\n\nAccording to Frank \"Pistol Pete\" Eaton, her death was due to different circumstances. She had been attending a dance. Frank Eaton had been the last person to dance with Belle Starr when Edgar Watson, clearly intoxicated had asked to dance with her. When Belle Starr declined, he later followed her. When on the way home, she stopped to give her horse a drink at a creek, he shot and killed her. According to Frank Eaton, Watson was tried, convicted and executed by hanging for the murder.\n\nHowever, another story says there were no witnesses and no one was ever convicted of the murder. Suspects with apparent motive included her new husband and both of her children, as well as Edgar J. Watson, one of her sharecroppers, because he was afraid she was going to turn him in to the authorities as an escaped murderer from Florida with a price on his head. Watson, who was killed in 1910, was tried for her murder, but was acquitted, and the ambush has entered Western lore as \"unsolved\".\n\nOne source suggests her son, whom she had allegedly beaten for mistreating her horse, may have been her killer.\n\nAlthough an obscure figure outside Texas throughout most of her life, Belle's story was picked up by the dime novel and \"National Police Gazette\" publisher, Richard K. Fox. Fox made her name famous with his novel \"Bella Starr, the Bandit Queen, or the Female Jesse James\", published in 1889 (the year of her murder). This novel is still often cited as a historical reference. It was the first of many popular stories that used her name.\n\nBelle's son, Eddie Reed, was convicted of horse theft and receiving stolen property in July 1889. Judge Parker sent him to prison in Columbus, Ohio. Belle's daughter, Rosie Reed, also known as Pearl Starr, became a prostitute to raise funds for Eddie's release. She did eventually obtain a presidential pardon in 1893. Ironically, Eddie became a deputy in Fort Smith and killed two outlaw brothers named Crittenden in 1895, and was himself killed in a saloon in Claremore, Oklahoma on December 14, 1896.\n\nPearl operated several bordellos in Van Buren and Fort Smith, Arkansas, from the 1890s to World War I.\n\n\n\"Belle Starr In Velvet\" by Kenneth D.

He was their third son, and the first to survive to adulthood.\n\nBlyth was trained as a railway engineer under an apprenticeship with Grainger & Miller, a railway contractor. In 1848 he established an engineering practice on the prestigious George Street (at no 124) in Edinburgh where it would remain for the next 100 years.

{"id": "479512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=479512", "title": "Better Business Bureau", "text": "Better Business Bureau\n\nThe Better Business Bureau (BBB), founded in 1912, is a private, nonprofit organization whose self-described mission is to focus on advancing marketplace trust, consisting of 106 independently incorporated local BBB organizations in the United States and Canada, coordinated under the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau is not affiliated with any governmental agency. Businesses that affiliate with the BBB and adhere to its standards do so through industry self-regulation. To avoid bias, the BBB's policy is to refrain from recommending or endorsing any specific business, product or service.\n\nThe organization has been the subject of controversy, particularly related to its alleged practice of giving higher ratings to businesses that pay a membership fee. The BBB disputes the claim that payment from businesses is required for them to receive an \"A\" rating. Business consultant and previous national Manager of Customer Service for Checker Auto Parts Eva Love observed, \"Complaining about a business to the Better Business Bureau is like complaining to the mouse's mother after a mouse steals your cheese. It will help if the wind is blowing in your direction.\"\n\nNearly 400,000 local businesses in North America are accredited by the BBB. The BBB prospects successfully vetted businesses to become dues-paying 'accredited businesses' that pledge and continue to adhere to the BBB Code of Business Practices. In return, the BBB allows accredited businesses in good standing to use its trademarked logo in marketing materials.\n\n\"Medical quackery and the promotions of nostrums and worthless drugs were among the most prominent abuses which led to the establishment of formal self-regulation in business and, in turn, to the creation of the NBBB.\" The concept of the Better Business Bureau has been credited to several court cases, such as United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola, initiated by the government against a number of organizations, including the Coca-Cola Company, in 1906 after the Pure Food and Drug Act had become law. Samuel Candler Dobbs, sales manager of Coca-Cola and later its president, took up the cause of truth in advertising in the wake of those judgments.\n\nIn 1909, Dobbs became president of the Associated Advertising Clubs of America, now the American Advertising Federation (AAF), and began to make speeches on the subject. In 1911, he was involved in the adoption of the \"Ten Commandments of Advertising,\" one of the first codes of advertising developed by groups of advertising firms and individual businesses. Similar organizations in succeeding decades, such as the National Better Business Commission, Inc. of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World (1921), and the National Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (1933), merged to become the Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., in 1946. In 1970, the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) was established.\n\nThe 112 BBBs are independently governed by their own boards of directors and must meet international BBB standards, which are monitored by the CBBB. The CBBB is governed by leaders of local BBBs, as well as by senior executives from major corporations, and community leaders such as academics and legal experts. Each BBB is run separately and is chiefly funded by its accredited businesses, who often serve on its board. A study by a business school dean at Marquette University found that ninety percent of BBB board members are from business.\n\nBusinesses that move from one BBB jurisdiction to another may need to apply for BBB accreditation in the new BBB location unless they have a system-wide accreditation. CBBB receives membership dues from BBBs, which amounted to US $4,884,226 in 2009.\n\nThe organization's dispute resolution procedures are established by the Council of the Better Business Bureaus, and implemented by local BBBs. Usually, disputes can be resolved through mediation; when appropriate, low- or no‑cost arbitration may also be offered and provided through the BBB. The BBB acts as a neutral party when providing dispute resolution services.\n\nComplaints about the practice of professions like medicine and law are usually not handled by the BBB and are referred to associations regulating those professions. The BBB does not handle complaints that have gone to court or are in the process of going to court as the complaint is already being handled by an alternative entity.\n\nIf a BBB receives a consumer dispute, the BBB contacts the business in question and offers to mediate the dispute. A business does not need to be a member of the BBB to use its mediation services. BBB accreditation, or membership, is completely optional for a business to accept and participate in through the payment of dues. Past complaints allege that the BBB compiles scores based upon their ability to collect their money from businesses, and not entirely upon business performance.\n\nThe National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus in the United States and Canada reviews factual claims made in national advertisements. They offer alternative dispute resolution services for advertisers, typically reaching a conclusion within 90 days of a filing. Compliance with findings is voluntary.\n\nUntil 2008, the BBB rated companies \"satisfactory\" or \"unsatisfactory.\" On January 1, 2009, the BBB moved to a new system based on a school-style A to F rating system. The 16 factors have been posted on each business review since the program's inception and the details on the points awarded as well. Initially there was a 17th factor worth 4 points for businesses that were Accredited and paid a fee to BBB. That process was changed in November 2010 in response to criticism in the media and from the Connecticut attorney general who accused BBB of using \"pay to play\" tactics.\n\nIf a business chooses not to provide basic information, such as size and start date, the BBB may assign a not-rated (NR) rating. A low rating due solely to a company not providing information would read: \"BBB does not have sufficient background information on this business.\"\n\nA business is eligible for BBB accreditation if it meets, in the opinion of the BBB, the \"BBB Standards for Trust\". There are eight BBB Standards for Trust that the BBB expects its accredited businesses to adhere to build trust (\"maintain a positive track record in the marketplace\"), advertise honestly, tell the truth, be transparent, honor promises, be responsive (address marketplace disputes), safeguard privacy (protect consumer data) and embody integrity.\n\nThe Attorney General of Connecticut demanded that the BBB stop using its weighted letter grade system, calling it \"potentially harmful and misleading\" to consumers. Responding to the Attorney General of Connecticut and others, the BBB has since modified its letter grade system.\n\nIn 2010 ABC's \"20/20\" reported in a segment titled \"The Best Ratings Money Can Buy\" about the irregularities in BBB ratings. They reported that a man created two dummy companies which received \"A+\" ratings as soon as he had paid the membership fee. They also reported that business owners were told that the only way to improve their rating was by paying the fee. In one case a \"C\" was turned to an \"A\" immediately after a payment and in another case a C‑minus became an \"A+\". The chef Wolfgang Puck said that some of his businesses receive \"F\" because he refuses to pay a fee. Ritz Carlton, which does not belong either, also receives Fs for not responding to its complaints.\n\nIn response, the president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has stated the BBB ratings system will cease awarding points to businesses for being BBB members. The national BBB's executive committee voted to address the public's perception of the ratings system. It voted that the BBB ratings system would no longer give additional points to businesses because they are accredited. It voted to implement a system to handle complaints about BBB sales practices. Despite the vote, the BBB website still states that points are taken away if accreditation is lost.\n\nIn Canada, CBC News reported in 2010 that Canadian BBBs were downgrading the ratings scores of businesses who stopped paying their dues. For example, a moving business who had an \"A\" rating and had been a BBB member for 20 years, dropped to a D‑minus rating when they allegedly no longer wanted to pay dues.\n\nBBBs have been accused of unduly protecting companies. If a branch does not act reasonably on behalf of a consumer, a complaint may be filed with the Federal Trade Commission. Moreover, recent reports have suggested that the Austin chapter of the Better Business Bureau refused to resolve complaints against companies if customers do not pay a $70 mediation fee.\n\nAdditionally, while the BBB publishes names of corporations, it withholds the names of individuals lodging complaints. The BBB also publishes the complainant's claim without any attempt at verification. The net result is that the BBB can be used to launch anonymous attacks on businesses with the onus falling on the business to refute any untrue or exaggerated claims made by the complainant.\n\nIt has been reported that the BBB encourages and solicits money from the very businesses they monitor which, again, raises the question of neutrality. The BBB states that they hold their Accredited businesses to a higher standard, as outlined in their Accreditation standards. This behavior is likely the reason for such backronyms as, \"Better for Businesses Bureau\" and \"Bribes from Businesses Bureau,\" popular nicknames for the organization presumably stemming from the frustration regarding the above criticisms.\n\nOn December 22, 2010, William Mitchell, CEO of the Los Angeles BBB, and originator of the BBB letter grading system, resigned as a result of an internal investigation conducted by the CBBB. The resignation was rescinded shortly afterward, however, with Mitchell claiming that his health prompted him to resign, and criticizing the National Council for attempting to take over the Southern California chapter.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan Toronto closed in 1995 following reports of high executive pay.\n\nOn August 16, 2011 the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB) announced the formal integration of operations in the United States & Canada, effective immediately. The CBBB Board of Directors voted earlier this month on the integration plan. The Council of Better Business Bureaus is the international headquarters of the BBB system and the governing body that licenses local BBBs and provides support services to increase their effectiveness.\n\nAccording to the statement, integration marks the way \"...for an improved customer experience for those who purchase goods and services across the border.\" \"The U.S. and Canada remain each other's largest trading partners,\" noted Stephen A. Cox, President and CEO of CBBB. \"We are really one North American marketplace, and the BBB system now reflects that. Not only will it be easier for consumers to check out businesses in either country, it will be simpler for them to file a complaint or resolve a dispute.\"\n\nThe move was supported by the Canadian Council of Better Business Bureaus (CCBBB). \"Given the advances in technology and the globalization of services, it no longer makes sense to maintain two separate systems,\" said M. Jean Lemyre, chair of the CCBBB. \"The vast majority of consumers initially contact BBB through the Internet.

The CBBB said it made the move to withdraw trademark authorization from the offices in Hamilton, Windsor, Montreal and St. John's after determining these four Canadian offices did not meet the defined standards of operation.\n\nCBBB realigned the boundaries of its affected Canadian offices and folded them into larger offices. Hamilton has been gathered under the banner of the BBB's Kitchener office, while the territories in SW Ontario (including Windsor) are now part of the Western Ontario region based in London, ON.\n\nThe former President of the Better Business Bureau of Windsor and South Western Ontario claims that he continues to operate under the name IntegrityLink in 2011, although services offered under that name have not been verified and the CBBB maintains concerns that some of the former BBB's continue to make use of proprietary information to which they are no longer entitled.\n\nSince 2011 the Hamilton, Montreal & St. John's offices have also changed their names or closed following what they termed a takeover by the U.S.-based Council of Better Business Bureaus. The Hamilton, Ontario BBB adopted the name Canadian Businesses and Charity Bureau. In May 2012, the Hamilton organization was locked out of its office by its landlord in a rent dispute.\nLocal BBBs in Montreal and St. John's, Newfoundland also left the CBBB and lost the right to use the BBB name. The Montreal BBB changed its name to L'Office de Certification Commerciale du Québec or Québec Commercial Certification Office, while the BBB in St. John's, Newfoundland, reportedly closed.\n\nOn March 12, 2013, the Council of Better Business Bureaus expelled the Los Angeles-based Better Business Bureau of the Southland, the largest local BBB, claiming that the local group had not met the Council's \"standards relating to accreditation, reporting on businesses, and handling complaints.\" \n\nThe Los Angeles group changed its name to the Business Consumer Alliance and said that it had followed all the Council's policies. The Council of Better Business Bureaus launched a new local BBB for the Los Angeles area.\n\n\n"}

Michael Porter used the term \"blind spots\" to refer to conventional wisdom which no longer holds true, but which still guides business strategy. The concept was further popularized by Barbara Tuchman, in her book \"The March of Folly\" (1984), to describe political decisions and strategies which were clearly wrong in their assumptions, and by other authors since, such as social psychologists Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald in their study of prejudice.\n\nBen Gilad fully developed, in his book, \"Business Blindspots\" (1994), the following three-step \"Gilad method\" for uncovering blind spots\n\nUnderlying Blindspots Analysis is an assumption about the inherent biases of decision making at the top of organizations (business, government or otherwise) exceeding those of their subordinates or outsiders. While many top executives in business and government organizations are smart, capable people, they are also vulnerable to several decision biases that come with their powerful positions, including cognitive dissonance, motivated cognitions, overconfidence, and ego-involvement. The impaired ability of leaders to see reality for what it is, and the more objective (less ego-involved) analysis of analysts and mid-level planners means that Step 3 of the Blindspots Analysis can be a powerful tool for pointing to potential blinders\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26715055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26715055", "title": "Eduardo Georgetti", "text": "Eduardo Georgetti\n\nEduardo Georgetti (October 11, 1866 – 1937), was an agriculturist, businessman, philanthropist, and politician. Georgetti, who came from a family of prosperous land owners, became one of Puerto Rico's wealthiest sugar barons and benefactors. In 1917, he became the first Vice-president of the Puerto Rican Senate.\n\nGeorgetti (sometimes also spelled as \"Giorgetti\") was born in the town of Manatí. His father was Dr. Pedro Juan Giorgetti Battesti, an immigrant from Corsica and his mother Guadalupe Fernandez Vanga y Freites, native of Puerto Rico whose family were land owners. He became orphaned at a young age and went to live with his maternal uncle. He received his primary education in the \"Colegio de los Jesuitas de San Juan\" (School of the Jesuits of San Juan). Georgetti inherited the lands of his parents which his uncle administrated, during the time that he was in Corsica pursuing his secondary education at the \"Liceo de Córcega\" (Lyceum of Corsica).\n\nUpon his return to Puerto Rico he found that the lands which he had left in the hands of his uncle had prospered enormously. Georgetti married Aúrea Balseiro Dávila in 1888. Together with is father-in-law, Rafael Balseiro, he purchased a company called \"Florida Agrícola\" and renamed it \"Sociedad Agrícola Industrial Balseiro y Georgetti\" (the Balseiro and Georgetti Industrial Agricultural Society). Georgetti founded and was the owner of the \"Plazuela Sugar Company,\" a sugar refinery, in the town of Barceloneta which had its own dock that was used to transport sugar by barge to the waiting ships on the ocean. The company, which was the core of his fortune, was the main source of income and employment of the towns' inhabitants. \n\nGeorgetti expanded his sugar industry empire by purchasing land and other sugar refineries. Among the sugar plantations which Georgetti purchased were \"Los Canos\" in Arecibo and the \"Central Plata,\" in which he served as the corporation's president. He was also the owner of the island's second largest pineapple plantation. Giorgetti was also a member of the board of directors of various banks, including the American Colonial Bank, \"Banco Comercial de Puerto Rico\" and \"Banco Nova Scotia.\"\n\nIt was common practice in Puerto Rico for businessmen to become involved in politics. On December 23, 1897, Georgetti was named Mayor of Barceloneta by Sabas Marin Gonzalez, the then-appointed Spanish governor of Puerto Rico. After the United States invaded Puerto Rico and the island became a U.S. territory as a result of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, which ended the Spanish–American War, the military-appointed governor, Major General John R. Brooke, permitted, upon the advice of Luis Muñoz Rivera, that Georgetti continue as mayor. Under the new administration, Barceloneta was merged with the town of Manati, as part of a joint municipality. Georgetti did not agree with this, and fought successfully for the re-establishment of Barceloneta as a separate, stand-alone municipality. \n\nGeorgetti continued to serve as mayor of Barceloneta from 1897 to 1898. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico, which supported the Spanish government headed by Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, which had promised an autonomous government for Puerto Rico. After the Spanish–American War, when Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States, Georgetti, together with his friend Luis Muñoz Rivera, Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Antonio R. Barceló and José de Diego, founded the Union Party of Puerto Rico. The party won the elections in 1904 and Georgetti was elected to the Puerto Rican House of Representatives. This Union Party opposed the passage of the U.S. Foraker Act, which extended every U.S. federal law into Puerto Rico, and subsumed the entire body of Puerto Rico's statutory and regulatory code under the framework of U.S. federal law. The Union Party also favored the acquisition of greater political autonomy for Puerto Rico, as a pathway to full independence.\n\nIn 1916, Georgetti's long-time friend Luis Muñoz Rivera fell gravely ill in New York City and returned to Puerto Rico, staying in Georgetti's house to recuperate. Georgetti summoned Muñoz Rivera's wife and son, Luis Muñoz Marin, to Puerto Rico and informed them that he was suffering from an infection that had begun in the gallbladder, before expanding throughout his body. On November 15, 1916, Muñoz Rivera died during his stay in the Georgetti residence. Georgetti's 1914 Pierce Arrow automobile was used in the statesman's funeral procession. Together with a group of friends, Georgetti purchased Muñoz Rivera's newspaper \"La Democracia\" and provided Muñoz Rivera's widow Amalia Marín Castilla with a small monthly pension. \"La Democracia\" also provided Rivera's son, Muñoz Marin, with an outlet to publish his written works. Georgetti also purchased the Muñoz Rivera home in 1916 and donated it together with the Pierce Arrow car to the town of Barranquitas to be preserved as a national monument.\n\nAfter Muñoz Rivera's death, Barceló became the leading force behind the Union Party and its liberal ideas for the island. In the elections of 1917, the Union Party was victorious. Antonio R. Barceló was named President of the Puerto Rican Senate and Georgetti was named vice-president, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to hold said position. In 1924, Barceló later formed a political coalition with José Tous Soto, the president of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico, and founded the Alianza Puertorriqueña (\"Puerto Rican Alliance\"). This coalition came about because both Barceló and Tous Soto came to believe that neither independence nor statehood would be considered by the United States. Therefore, rather than wage a futile political battle, their \"Alliance\" would concentrate on Puerto Rico's economic situation. This led to ideological conflict between Georgetti and Barceló. \n\nGeorgetti was committed to the original \"independentista\" ideals of the Union Party, and found these incompatible with an \"economic partnership\" with the United States, as espoused by the Alliance coalition. Barceló and a group of party delegates had traveled to Washington, D.C. to seek changes in the Jones Act of 1917, by claiming that the Puerto Rican economy was sound and that Puerto Ricans were capable of electing their own governor. In response, Georgetti traveled to Washington as a representative of various island organizations, among them the Agriculturist Association and the Association of Sugar Producers. The group which he represented became known by the press as the \"Fuerzas Vivas\" (Live Forces). \n\nGeorgetti and the \"Fuerzas Vivas\" submitted a \"Fiscal Memorandum\" to the U.S. Secretary of War, which presented a much bleaker view of the Puerto Rican economy. According to this memorandum, the island was on the brink of economic ruin unless it diversified its agricultural production, and become less dependent on the sugar industry as its sole source of income. Georgetti's actions were viewed by Barceló as an attempt by Georgetti and the \"Fuerzas Vivas\" to discredit Barceló and weaken the Alliance. Georgetti denied this, and quit the Alliance.\n\nIn 1923, Georgetti and his wife built a mansion in Santurce. Known as the \"Mansion Georgetti,\" it was located on the \"Avenida Ponce de León\" (Ponce de León Avenue), designed and built by Czech architect Antonin Nechodoma, and considered to be the grandest mansion in the Caribbean at the time. \n\nPrior to the mansion, Georgetti lived in a Rio Piedras house built in 1868. The house, known as the \"Casa Georgetti,\" is the oldest Spanish colonial structure in Puerto Rico. \n\nGeorgetti and his wife did not have any offspring, however they were the benefactors of many talented children who lacked the economic means to pursue an education. As a philanthropist, he was a sponsor of the arts and sciences. Georgetti was also the president of the Children's Tuberculosis Sanitarium of Puerto Rico. \n\nEduardo Georgetti died in his Santurce residence in 1937. His wife Aúrea died the following year. Their \"Mansion Georgetti\" was sold in 1971, demolished, and replaced with an apartment building complex. \n\nThe \"Casa Georgetti\" in Rio Piedras was landmarked and restored to its original condition.\n\nThe town of Barceloneta honored Georgetti's memory by naming a principal avenue and an urbanization (Villa Georgetti) after him. In the town of Santurce there is also a theater, \"Teatro Georgetti,\" named in his honor. Other cities in Puerto Rico have honored his memory by naming several streets after him, including San Juan, Humacao, Comerio and Vega Alta.\n\n\n"}

(ETI) was a joint venture between the Škoda group in the Czech Republic and AAI Corporation in the United States which made trolleybuses for the Dayton and San Francisco trolleybus systems, constructing a total of 330 trolleybuses. ETI was formed in 1994, and ownership was divided as 65% by Škoda and 35% by AAI. The latter was a wholly owned subsidiary of United Industrial Corporation. Up to that time, Škoda had built more than 12,000 trolleybuses since 1935, but none for cities outside Europe and Asia.\n\nThe company was awarded its first contract in November 1994, when the Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority, of Dayton, Ohio placed an order for 63 two-axle trolleybuses. The order was later reduced to 61 vehicles, and ultimately to 57. Three prototype trolleybuses were delivered in December 1995 and January 1996. These were designated by ETI as model 14TrE, the E standing for \"export\", and were given fleet numbers 9601–9603 by MVRTA. Following modifications to the design, construction of the 54 production-series ETI trolleybuses for Dayton took place in 1998–99. These were model 14TrE2 and were numbered 9801–9854 in MVRTA's fleet. Among the modifications were the moving of the wheelchair lift from the rear door to the front door, which necessitated widening the body from to and changing from a one-piece windshield to a two-piece one.\n\nIn July 1997, the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) contracted with ETI for the provision of 250 trolleybuses, comprising 220 standard/two-axle () and 30 articulated () vehicles. ETI designated the two types for San Francisco as models 14TrSF and 15TrSF, respectively. In February 2000, Muni exercised contract options to purchase an additional 20 two-axle and three articulated vehicles. Two prototypes for the two-axle trolleybuses (numbered 5401–5402) were received by Muni in January 1999 and June 1999, respectively, while an articulated prototype (No. 7101) was received in April 2000. The 238 production-series two-axle trolleybuses (Nos. 5403–5640) were delivered between May 2001 and early 2004. The production-series articulateds (7102–7133) were all delivered in 2003. All 273 of Muni's ETI trolleybuses had entered service by April 2004.\n\nWith both the Dayton and San Francisco orders, the chassis/body-frame (or shell) and motors of each vehicle were fabricated at Škoda's plant in Ostrov nad Ohří, Czech Republic, then shipped to a facility in Hunt Valley, Maryland (near other AAI facilities) for initial fitting-out. Except in the case of the prototypes, final fitting-out was undertaken in leased premises located in the two cities purchasing the vehicles, Dayton and San Francisco.\n\nETI originally was based in Dayton, but after completion of the contract for that city, the Dayton office was closed and ETI moved its administrative office to Hunt Valley, sharing space with partner AAI there.\nIn 2003, ETI engaged in a competitive bidding for a large contract (245 trolleybuses) being offered by TransLink, of Vancouver, B.C., Canada for supply of trolleybuses to the Vancouver trolleybus system, but lost out to New Flyer Industries. The joint venture did not seek any further new business, and in May 2004 it finalized an agreement with San Francisco Muni to transfer to Muni its remaining contractual obligations.\n\n\n"}

It was built in 1911 as the residence of real estate developer Robert Wilson Goelet (not to be confused with his first cousin, Robert Walton Goelet) on the grounds of his sprawling estate in Sugar Loaf, a hamlet of the town of Chester, New York.\n\nRobert Wilson Goelet (1880–1966), the only son of Ogden Goelet, commissioned the architects Carrère and Hastings to design a country villa in 1911. It was designed in a Tuscan style because Goelet's wife, the former Miss Elsie Whelen of Philadelphia, had always wanted to live in an Italian villa. The house features a central courtyard with an Italian marble fountain, and ochre-colored stucco walls. Beatrix Jones Farrand was hired to landscape the grounds, and Samuel Yellin did the ironwork for the house.\n\nIn addition to their horses, Goelet and his wife were breeders of Highland Terriers and Great Danes, and they maintained extensive kennels. Soon, the estate and its storied hunting grounds became a regular haunt of Babe Ruth, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.\n\nGoelet hosted numerous sporting-set events at the estate, including equine ice-racing. The younger of Goelet's two sons, Peter, began radio station WGNY on the grounds of the mansion in 1930.\n\nGlenmere was sold to Abraham Prusoff during World War II. He transformed the private mansion into a resort hotel with upscale amenities, including a golf course, ski run, and tennis courts. By the 1960s, Prusoff found it increasingly difficult to keep the resort's finances in order. In the next decade, the mansion and estate were seized by Orange County as a tax lien. In 1985, the mansion and estate were purchased at a tax auction by real estate magnate Rickey Mandel.\n\nThe mansion changed hands again in 2007, becoming a luxury 19-room hotel, restaurant, and spa, after undergoing an extensive and costly renovation. In 2008, the restoration project was temporarily halted over concern for the endangered Northern cricket frog.\n\nIn 2010, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation again halted the construction when it became apparent that the developers were operating without the required permits and endangering the Northern cricket frog and plant life in the area. The mansion's developers were fined and cited by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation for violations of having improper paperwork with regard to the impact of construction on the endangered Northern cricket frog. Studies found no frog habitats on the property, and the mansion was made into a luxury hotel whose amenities include a luxury penthouse costing $3,400 a night.\n"}

His father, also named John Jervis, was an army captain from Staffordshire who died young, leaving his wife and six children. \nComing from an intensely military family, the 14-year-old Hercules Crosse was offered a commission in the army by his relative the Admiral of St Vincent, but he had other plans and turned the offer down. He was also of a very gentle and sensitive nature, and the idea of war deeply repelled him.\n\nAfter briefly visiting the Cape in 1816, he decided to move to the colony permanently, and arrived in Cape Town in 1821 with the intention of settling and making his fortune.\n\nSoon after moving to Cape Town, he found a job as a clerk in the trading firm \"Hudson, Donaldson & Dixon\" and worked his way up to being its manager - a position he held throughout his life until he retired from business in 1864. \nHe was enormously influential in starting and developing the Cape's wine exports, and founded a distillery for that purpose in the vicinity of Paarl. He came to have a presence in many of the Cape's institutions, including directorship in Mutual Life (1846), the Union Bank (1847), the Harbour Board and even the South African College (1860). He was also a veteran member of the Cape Town Commercial Exchange.\n\nJarvis married an Afrikaans woman, Elizabeth Maria Vos, joining the local Dutch Reformed Church (where he was later made an Elder) in order to do so. He was aged 19 at the time, and she was only 16. They had five daughters. One of them, Elizabeth Maria, met and married the young John Charles Molteno, who was later to become the Cape's first Prime Minister. Another daughter, Elizabeth Magdalena Christina (\"Betty\") married the Wynberg Mayor James Bisset and was mother to the Governor and cricketer Sir Murray Bisset. A third daughter, Sophia St Ives married the influential Cape businessman and exporter Percy John Allport. Anne Jarvis married the widower and Indian army officer Major William Bazett Gordon Blenkins C.B. The youngest daughter Emmie never married.\n\nHercules Crosse became a prominent fighter for the establishment of a representative Cape parliament, and when it was finally created he took a seat as the first minister to stand for Cape Town. In addition, the city of Cape Town was set up with a \"Board of Commissioners\" (later, \"Municipal Council\") in 1840 and Jarvis was immediately elected onto it, soon becoming its chairman. He had particularly good relations with the Cape Malay community of Cape Town, and throughout his political career he derived a good deal of his political support from this important voting bloc.\n\nHe went on to become mayor and first citizen of Cape Town from 1848 to 1861, making him the longest serving of any first citizen of Cape Town. \nAs mayor, Jarvis was responsible for much of the early development of Cape Town's infrastructure. He drew up the plans for the city's first breakwater and harbour, and was a member of the Harbour Board for forty years. \n\nHe was an impartial and influential spokesman of the city during the Anti-Convict Movement (1848-1850), holding public meetings and presiding over debates. This local movement had developed in response to an attempt by the British government to turn the Cape Colony into a penal colony. In the end, it was Jarvis' resolutions on the matter that ended up being conveyed to the Governor and the Queen. He subsequently suggested a renaming of a portion of the Heerengracht to \"Adderley Street\" - now the central street of the Cape Town CBD - after the man who had championed the opinion of the Cape citizens in the House of Commons.\n\nIn the 1860s he joined the growing movement for Responsible government that was led by his son-in-law John Molteno.\n\nThe Cape's economy was in a severely depressed state in the 1860s, and Jarvis's vast business interests were one of the many victims of this economic stagnation. Once the leading wine merchant in the country, he eventually declared bankruptcy in 1864 and, already elderly, never completely recovered financially, even in the country's 1870s economic boom. He sold his Somerset Road house and moved in with the extended family of his son-in-law John Molteno, in Claremont. \nIn later life, he took an avid interest in mining. He unsuccessfully prospected for coal in the Cape Town City Bowl area, before setting up a Manganese mining venture outside Paarl.\n\nHe died at the house of his daughter Sophia St Ives Mary Alport, in Claremont, Cape Town, in 1889 and was buried beside his wife at Claremont St. Saviours Church.\n"}

{"id": "46351868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46351868", "title": "Kilkenny Design Workshops", "text": "Kilkenny Design Workshops\n\nThe Kilkenny Design Workshops (KDW) were a government-funded research and development centre of excellence for design (and design advocacy, research and promotion) which was established in Ireland in 1963. It was created to inspire, support and demonstrate to industry how design could be the key factor in change and lead to economic success. This was a new departure, up to this point no model had existed anywhere in the world for this type of practice. Teamwork is common today in design practices but this method was new for its time. KDW operated from the converted Ormonde Stables in Kilkenny City from its official opening in 1965 until its closure in 1988.\n\nWilliam H. Walsh was the founder of KDW and Chief Executive of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta (CTT) or Irish Export Board. He had a vision for improving standards of design in industry to encourage commerce, trade and export. Walsh also realised the importance of design for the Irish market and how the existing situation in Ireland in the early 1960s (including protective tariffs) meant that a strategy would be required to encourage appreciation and promotion of good design.\n\nSteps had been taken to ensure that the design situation in Ireland was carefully assessed. A group of selected Scandinavian designers were commissioned to compile the \"Design in Ireland\" report (also known as \"The Scandinavian Report\"), auditing the standards of design in Ireland. William H. Walsh spearheaded the establishment of Kilkenny Design Workshops, itself a revolutionary move as this was to be the first state agency established outside Dublin.\n\nThe early workshops in Kilkenny were Ceramics, Candle making, Precious Metals and Metalwork Woodturning and Textiles; which comprised weaving and printed textile departments. Graphic Design was added to in 1969 and 3D work included Furniture Design. Designers also contributed to packaging production and exhibition’s design. Industrial Design and Design Consultancy services were offered to clients as the shift moved from traditional industry to engineering based production industries.\n\nWorkshops were staffed with teams of creatives; artists designers, craftspeople, apprentices, graduates and students, including technicians and chemists to assist with research and development. The management team also consisted of a creative and active board that included artists Louis le Brocquy, Pat Scott and Sir Basil Goulding.\n\nRetail was seen as an opportunity from the early days of KDW and the KDW shop was used to sell prototypes, promote design and provide manufacturers with a working example of the business opportunities around well designed and promoted Irish products. Links were forged with buyers from American and UK retailers. KDW opened a shop in Ghiradelli Square in San Francisco and participated in in-store promotions in Altman's in New York, Heal's in London and Neiman Marcus in Dallas.\n\nDesign advocacy included seminars and exhibitions, the education of the designers in the workshops led to the potential for good design to spread out of the Kilkenny Graduate Programmes which refined the skills of young designers. Many of those who partook in programmes ran by KDW went on to establish their own creative enterprises or teach in design departments at second and third level in Ireland. KDW also had participation in and representation on international design organisations including the World Crafts Council, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and the International Council of Design (Ico-D), formerly known as International Council of Graphic Design Associations (ICOGRADA). Later KDW itself became an inspiration and a model for design development in other countries, its legacy spread to several countries around the world interested in building up design for industry and using KDW’s example as a template for establishing this approach in their own country.\n\nAlthough Kilkenny Design Workshops ceased operation in 1988 their output had transformed the visual culture of Ireland. KDW demonstrated the importance of design for efficient manufacturing processes and well designed marketing material to communicate the quality of products, it also endorsed the creation of beautiful products that could be both functional and visually appealing.\n\nIn 2013, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the KDW, the Design & Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI) held a conference titled \"KDW@21C\" that sought to investigate the continuing legacy and acknowledge the influence of the KDW on Irish design practice and culture. Part of the conference was a \"Remembering KDW\" event, a reunion for former KDW participants.\n\nIn 2015, the DCCoI released an iOS app titled \"Kilkenny Design Workshops\" highlighting the work of the KDW.\n\n2015 marked 50 years since KDW officially opened. To commemorate this event, the Global Irish Economic Forum in 2013 conceived of ID2015, a year-long programme celebrating the history of Irish design. ID2015 was a major government backed initiative that explored, promoted and celebrated Irish design through events and activities on the island of Ireland and in renowned international capitals of design and commerce.\n\nThe initiative sought to:\n\nThe all-island initiative was convened by the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI), in collaboration with partner organisations, on behalf of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Enterprise Ireland. President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins was the Patron of Irish Design 2015.\n\nAs part of ID2015, Dublin was designated World Design Hub 2015 by the International Association of Designers, providing Ireland with a platform to promote the skills and talents of Irish designers to a worldwide audience.\n\nThe achievements and impact of ID2015 are discussed in \"Irish Design 2015 - Making Design Matter\" a book that offers a comprehensive examination of the year of Irish design. Through a series of essays by key participants in the initiative, spotlight reports on the different projects mounted throughout the year, and group discussions featuring leading Irish and international figures from the sector, \"Making Design Matter\" captures the why and the how of the landmark initiative that was Irish Design 2015 (ID2015). Edited by Professor Alex Milton, ID2015 Programme Director; Karen Hennessy, CEO of ID2015 and DCCoI and Rachel Donnelly, ID2015 Content Editor, the publication takes a broad view of the design sector in Ireland, reflecting on key moments in its past, engaging with its vibrant present, and speculating about its optimistic future. The publication also presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of the year's activities, alongside statistics representing the economic footprint of the design sector in Ireland. ID2015 was pioneering in its target-focused approach to making design matter, with the result that this is the first ever quantitative analysis of the impact of design activity mounted on this scale.\n\nKey outcomes of the initiative were:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20153125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20153125", "title": "Legal governance, risk management, and compliance", "text": "Legal governance, risk management, and compliance\n\nLegal Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance or \"LGRC\", refers to the complex set of processes, rules, tools and systems used by corporate legal departments to adopt, implement and monitor an integrated approach to business problems.\nWhile Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance refers to a generalized set of tools for managing a corporation or company, Legal GRC, or LGRC, refers to a specialized – but similar – set of tools utilized by attorneys, corporate legal departments, general counsel and law firms to govern themselves and their corporations, especially but not exclusively in relation to the law.\nOther specializations within the realm of governance, risk management and compliance include IT GRC and financial GRC. Within these three realms, there is a great deal of overlap, particularly in large corporations that have legal and IT departments, as well as financial departments.\n\nLegal governance refers to the establishment, execution and interpretation of processes and rules put in place by corporate legal departments in order to ensure a smoothly-run legal department and corporation.\n\nLegal risk management refers to the process of evaluating alternative regulatory and non-regulatory responses to risk and selecting among them. Even with the legal realm, this process requires knowledge of the legal, economic and social factors, as well as knowledge of the business world in which legal teams operate. In an organizational setting, risk management refers to the process by which an organization sets the risk tolerance, identifies potential risks and prioritizes the tolerance for risk based on the organization’s business objectives, and manages and mitigates risks throughout the organization.\n\nLegal compliance is the process or procedure to ensure that an organization follows relevant laws, regulations and business rules. The definition of legal compliance, especially in the context of corporate legal departments, has recently been expanded to include understanding and adhering to ethical codes within entire professions, as well. There are two requirements for an enterprise to be compliant with the law, first its policies need to be consistent with the law. Second, its policies need to be complete with respect to the law.\nThe role of legal compliance has also been expanded to include self-monitoring the non-governed behavior with industries and corporations that could lead to workplace indiscretions.\nWithin the LGRC realm, it is important to keep in mind that if a strong legal governance component is in place, risk can be accurately assessed and the monitoring of legal compliance be carried out efficiently. It is also important to realize that within the LGRC framework, legal teams work closely with executive teams and other business departments to align their goals and ensure proper communication.\n\nLegal Consistency is a property that declares enterprise policies to be free of contradictions with the law. Legal Consistency has been defined as not having multiple verdicts for the same case \n. The antonym Legal Inconsistency is defined as having two rule that contradict each other. Other common definitions of consistency refer to “treating similar cases alike”. In the enterprise context, legal consistency refers to “obedience to the law”. In the context of legal requirements validation, legal consistency is defined as, \" Enterprise requirements are legally consistent if they adhere to the legal requirements and include no contradictions.\"\n\nLegal Completeness is a property that declares enterprise policies to cover all scenarios included or suggested by the law. Completeness suggests that there are no scenarios covered by the law that cannot be implemented in the enterprise. In addition, it implies that all scenarios not allowed by the law are not allowed by the enterprise.\n\nEnterprise policies are said to be legally complete if they contain no gaps in the legal sense. Completeness can be thought of in two ways: Some scholars make use of a concept of ‘obligational’ completeness such as Ayres and Gertner. \nAccording to this usage, a system or a contract is ‘obligationally’ complete if it specifies what each party is to do in every situation, even if this is not the optimal action to take under some circumstances. Others discuss ‘enforceability’ completeness in the sense that failing to specify key terms can lead a court to characterize a system as being too uncertain to enforce (May & Butcher v the King 1934), and hence a system may be complete with respect to enforceability. This leads to the following definition: enterprise regulations or requirements are legally complete if it specifies what each party is to do in each situation while covering all gaps in the legal sense.\n\nLebogang says. Like the Sarbanes-Oxley act, legal industry thought leaders saw a need for a new framework for legal GRC, and borrowed heavily from IT, RIM and other industries to try to come up with new, clear processes and rules to make navigating the choppy waters of the post-financial crisis legal world go as smoothly as possible.\n\nThe Legal GRC Center for Innovation is a nonprofit institute for the advancement of the concepts and applications of Legal GRC. The LGRC Center for Innovation serves as a forum for legal industry leaders to discuss and determine ways to systematize and streamline within the legal industry. The membership of the LGRC-CFI is made up of a group of [thought leaders] in the legal, business, IT, and RIM fields. They meet in online forums and at periodic conventions and summits to determine best practices for Legal GRC. The LGRC-CFI also publishes a blog and several industry-specific white papers regularly. The LGRC Center for Innovation addresses legal governance, risk management, and compliance exclusively.\n\nThe Institute on Governance (IOG), although it does not address LGRC exclusively, is a useful resource for knowledge on governance in general, and has collected some significant basics about legal governance online.\nThe IOG is an independent, Canadian, nonprofit [think tank] founded in 1990 to promote better governance for public benefit. Through our research and services we help public organizations and societies realize their objectives by putting good governance into practice.\n\nThe Association of Corporate Counsel (\"ACC\"), formerly the American Corporate Counsel Association (\"ACCA\"), is an association of in-house counsel, attorneys who work for corporations. The association publishes the magazine ACC Docket and arranges one of the United States’ largest annual meetings for in-house attorneys. ACC was founded in 1982. It currently has more than 24,000 members from over 10,500 corporations in 77 countries.[1]\nThe ACC does not address LGRC exclusively, but can be credited with laying some foundations for corporations – the original practitioners of governance, risk management, and compliance – and legal departments to begin to work together on overarching issues of governance, risk management, and compliance.\n\n"}

She said that when she delivered the tissues to his room, Omar locked his door, grabbed her in a bear hug, and began groping her breasts and kissing her on her neck and lips, squeezed her buttocks, and ground his crotch against her leg. She said that Omar only let her leave after she agreed to give him her phone number, and that she gave him a false one. Police said the maid reported the incident to her supervisor immediately, but that the supervisor told her to report the incident to a hotel security official the following day, and consequently the police weren't notified until the following day. A police spokesman said that detectives found the maid to be credible.\n\nOmar was arrested on May 30, 2011. He was charged with two counts of sexual assault, consisting of sex abuse and forcible touching. He appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court, and was released from Rikers Island on June 3, 2011, after posting $25,000 cash bail and surrendering his passport as he awaits trial. Omar was scheduled to return to court on August 23, 2011. His lawyer said he denies the charges.\n"}

{"id": "15660437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15660437", "title": "Patrick van der Eem", "text": "Patrick van der Eem\n\nPatrick Paul van der Eem (born 1973; Curaçao) is a Dutch Antillean entrepreneur and convicted drug dealer known for his part in the undercover television report about Joran van der Sloot that was produced by Dutch crime reporter Peter R. de Vries. The program set a Dutch television viewing record and renewed attention in the ongoing investigation of the 2005 disappearance of American student Natalee Holloway in Aruba.\n\nPatrick van der Eem is the son of Leon van der Eem, a former operator of nine McDonald's franchises. The younger van der Eem was convicted twice on drug charges and has been blocked from entering the United States because of his criminal record. According to van der Eem in 2008, he had only received traffic tickets since his last drug offense in 1995. In 2003, van der Eem opened a Pirtek franchise which repairs hydraulic hoses. A company spokesperson stated that van der Eem's 7-person organization is the best operated in the Benelux region.\n\nVan der Eem has a visible scar on his left cheek which he says is a \"boca grande\" inflicted on him by criminals in retaliation for being an informant. However, he had told his CEO Martin Melkert that the scar was the result of a car accident.\n\nOn February 3, 2008, SBS 6 aired a program produced by de Vries in which one time Dutch suspect Joran van der Sloot discusses his knowledge of the Natalee Holloway case with van der Eem while riding in a Range Rover that contained hidden cameras. Van der Sloot is seen in the tape smoking marijuana. Van der Eem later said that he regularly used cocaine in front of van der Sloot over a seven-month period to retain his trust. The broadcast was watched by 7 million viewers in the Netherlands and was the most popular non-sports program in Dutch television history. Van der Eem was paid €25,000 for his work on the undercover report.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ABC News, van der Eem said that he first met van der Sloot in a Dutch casino in Nijmegen. Without introduction, he said, \"Hey murderer!\" in Papiamento, the language of Aruba, to gain van der Sloot's attention. Van der Eem said that he was \"totally convinced Joran is telling the truth\" in the recordings. Van der Eem said that ABC paid US$830,000 to secure the rights to broadcast the program in the United States.\n\nAruban prosecutor Hans Mos said that he took the \"very impressive\" taped account \"very seriously\" and that he would reopen the investigation. However, the evidence was deemed insufficient to warrant re-arrest. Although the taped confession appeared damning, van der Sloot argued that he was lying to impress van der Eem, who he believed to be a drug dealer.\n\nEarly in March 2008, van der Eem himself was secretly taped after giving an interview for the Aruban television program Un Dia den Bida (One Day in Life) with John Anthony \"Poentje\" Castro. Van der Eem continued talking candidly, under the assumption that cameras had been turned off. Van der Eem disclosed that he had been a friend of van der Sloot for years, contradicting his statement on the de Vries program that he had just met van der Sloot in 2007. Van der Eem said that he expected to become a millionaire from his involvement in the Holloway case. He said that he knew the person who supposedly disposed of Holloway's body and that van der Sloot had asked him for two thousand euros to buy the man's silence. According to Dutch news service Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau, van der Eem, who had signed a book deal, \"was furious\" after learning of the taping and \"threatened\" the interviewer, who sought legal advice. Castro was requested by the Aruban Justice Department to refrain from broadcasting any material that could compromise the Holloway case.\nCastro himself was assassinated in front of his own home in December 2010. The police have had no success in linking this cold case to van der Eem.\n\nIn December 2008, van der Eem was arrested in Arnhem, Netherlands for attacking his girlfriend with a crowbar and driving erratically while evading police. He claimed to be under the influence of drugs at the time and was sentenced to 30 hours of community service.\n\nVan der Eem collaborated with author Elizabeth E. Byars to write \"Overboord: hoe ik Joran van der Sloot aan het praten kreeg\" (\"Overboard: how I got Joran van der Sloot to talk\"), an autobiographical non-fiction book that was first published in Dutch on June 25, 2008 by TM, an imprint of FMB uitgevers. The book became a best seller in the Netherlands and was later published in English as an eBook under the title \"Disposed: One Man's Journey to Uncover the Truth\". De Vries wrote the introduction to the book in which van der Eem covers his past as a drug addict and dealer and recounts his experience with van der Sloot with transcripts of the undercover video.\n\nIn December 2008, van der Eem was briefly arrested after being reported for the abuse of his girlfriend with a crowbar. In August 2009, he was arrested in Aruba for failing to pay his Radisson Hotel bill and threatening the personnel. It was alleged that he had also failed to pay his bill in three other 5-star hotels. It was also reported that he was in possession of cocaine. \n\nIn June 2011, van der Eem was arrested during a traffic police check on the A12 highway in the Netherlands.\n\nIn the 2009 American television show ‘Border Security USA’ S01E05, van der Eem is featured where he is refused entry into the US because of his criminal past. This episode can be viewed on You Tube.\n\nOn May 3, 2013 van der Eem was sentenced by the Arnhem District Court to serve twelve months in prison. The reason for his punishment was his co-perpetration in a ram-raiding in Oosterbeek stealing ski clothing with a value of approximately 30.000 euro as well as handling stolen goods by using a stolen Volkswagen Caddy for a covert transport of the clothes.\n\n"}

It lies atop a large underground parking garage.\n\nIn the 1850s, the location was used as a camp by settlers from outside the Pueblo de Los Angeles, which lay to the northeast around the Our Lady Queen of the Angels' church, the Los Angeles Plaza, and present-day Olvera Street. Surveyors drew the site as 10 individual plots of land, but in practicality it was a single parcel. Canals distributing water from the Zanja Madre were adjacent. In 1866 the site was dedicated as a public square by Mayor Cristobal Aguilar; it was called \"La Plaza Abaja,\" or \"The Lower Plaza.\" At some point the owner of a nearby \"beergarden\", German immigrant George \"Roundhouse\" Lehman, planted small native Monterey cypress trees, fruit trees, and flowering shrubs in the park and maintained them until his death in 1882.\n\nIn 1867, St. Vincent's College, present-day Loyola Marymount University, was situated across the street, and so the park informally became known as St. Vincent's Park. In 1870, it was officially named Los Angeles Park. In 1886 it was renamed 6th Street Park, and it redesigned with an \"official park plan\" by Frederick Eaton. In the early 1890s it was renamed Central Park. During this period a bandstand pavilion was added for concerts and orators. The plantings became sub-tropically lush, and the park became a shady oasis and an outdoor destination. In 1894 the park was used as the staging area for the annual crowning of the queen of 'La Fiesta de Los Angeles.\n\nA monument to California's twenty Spanish–American War dead was erected in 1900; it is said to be modeled after a Spanish–American War veteran, 7th California Infantry volunteer Charlie Hammond of San Francisco, and it is believed to be the oldest work of public art in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles City Council declared it a historic-cultural monument in 1990.\n\nIn 1910 the park was renovated under a design by John Parkinson, who later designed Los Angeles City Hall and Union Station. Parkinson's design featured a three-tier fountain sculpted by Johan Caspar Lachne Gruenfeld, braced by four life-size concrete cherubs supporting a vase of cascading water. In November 1918, a week after Armistice Day ended World War I, the park was renamed Pershing Square, in honor of Gen. John J. Pershing. A plaque was added in his honor some four decades later.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s tropical plants were added to the park. In 1924, a life-size bronze of a World War I doughboy, sculpted by Humberton Pedretti, was unveiled, flanked by old cannons. In 1935, a bronze cannon from the USS Constitution was added. In 1932, a statue of Ludwig van Beethoven was added to honor William Andrews Clark, Jr., founder of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\n\nThe park was in heavy use during World War II for rallies and recruitment. After the war, the park began to decline as commercial decentralization and suburbanization took hold in Greater Los Angeles Area, and Downtown lost importance and intensity of use.\n\nMany of the palm trees that were excavated in the 1950s were sent to be used in the Disneyland ride The Jungle Cruise.\n\nThe entire park was demolished and excavated in 1952 to build a three-level underground parking garage. Atop the garage, concrete was covered by a thin layer of soil with a broad expanse of lawn. Entry and exit ramps cut the square off from the sidewalks around it. In 1954, Kelly Roth, a Hungarian immigrant who had owned a cigar store across from the square, donated $30,000 for twin reflecting pool water features in honor of his late wife and to thank Los Angeles for the opportunities that the city provided him. The Roth fountains were designed by architect Stiles O. Clements.\n\nThe park continued to be neglected for safe uses. Its problems were noted during the 1960 Democratic National Convention, with nominee and future president John F. Kennedy headquartered at the Biltmore Hotel facing the park. By the 1984 Summer Olympics the park had become a serious eyesore, leading the city to spend $1 million for a temporary renovation.\n\nIn 1992, the park was closed for a major $14.5-million redesign and renovation by Mexican architect and landscape architect Ricardo Legorreta and U.S. landscape architect Laurie Olin. The redesigned park opened in 1994 with a 10-story purple bell tower, fountains, and a walkway representing an earthquake fault line (by artist Barbara McCarren), concert stage, and perimeter seating. Pavement covered almost the entire block, with copses of trees placed in raised planters.\n\nIn 2000, a monument was installed to honor local veteran Eugene A. Obregon.\nPershing Square regularly hosts seasonal events such as a temporary Ice rink in the winter and live concert performances in the summer.\n\nPermanent and temporary public art has been placed in Pershing Square since 1900, beginning with Los Angeles' oldest public art sculpture, the Spanish American War Memorial. \n\n\nThe area is served by the Pershing Square station of the Metro Red and Purple lines.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24389", "title": "Public relations", "text": "Public relations\n\nPublic relations (PR) is the practice of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the public. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than marketing or advertising. But now advertising is also a part of greater PR Activities.\nAn example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a positive or favorable view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, and public officials as PIOs and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager.\n\nPublic relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organisation's target audience, the media, relevant trade media, and other opinion leaders. Common responsibilities include designing communications campaigns, writing news releases and other content for news, working with the press, arranging interviews for company spokespeople, writing speeches for company leaders, acting as an organisation's spokesperson, preparing clients for press conferences, media interviews and speeches, writing website and social media content, managing company reputation (crisis management), managing internal communications, and marketing activities like brand awareness and event management Success in the field of public relations requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of each of the company's many stakeholders. The public relations professional must know how to effectively address those concerns using the most powerful tool of the public relations trade, which is publicity.\n\nIvy Lee, the man who turned around the Rockefeller name and image, and his friend, Edward Louis Bernays, established the first definition of public relations in the early 1900s as follows: \"a management function, which tabulates public attitudes, defines the policies, procedures and interests of an organization... followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance.\" However, when Lee was later asked about his role in a hearing with the United Transit Commission, he said \"I have never been able to find a satisfactory phrase to describe what I do.\" In 1948, historian Eric Goldman noted that the definition of public relations in Webster's would be \"disputed by both practitioners and critics in the field.\"\n\nAccording to Bernays, the public relations counsel is the agent working with both modern media of communications and group formations of society in order to provide ideas to the public’s consciousness. Furthermore, he is also concerned with ideologies and courses of actions as well as material goods and services and public utilities and industrial associations and large trade groups for which it secures popular support.\n\nIn August 1978, the World Assembly of Public Relations Associations defined the field as \"the art and social science of analyzing trends, predicting their consequences, counseling organizational leaders and implementing planned programs of action, which will serve both the organization and the public interest.\"\n\nPublic Relations Society of America, a professional trade association, defined public relations in 1982 as: \"Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other.\"\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, the PRSA solicited crowd supplied definitions for the term and allowed the public to vote on one of three finalists. The winning definition stated that: \n\"Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics.\"\n\nPublic relations can also be defined as the practice of managing communication between an organization and its publics.\n\nPublic relations is to speak out its advocacy in public, and it builds up a talking platform to achieve its goals and protect the interests of people.\n\nPublic relations is not a phenomenon of the 20th century, but rather has historical roots. Most textbooks consider the establishment of the Publicity Bureau in 1900 to be the founding of the public relations profession. However, academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations, during the settling of the New World and during the movement to abolish slavery in England. Basil Clark is considered the founder of public relations in the United Kingdom for his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924.\n\nPropaganda was used by the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the World Wars, which led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector. Most historians believe public relations became established first in the US by Ivy Lee or Edward Bernays, then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the Marshall plan.\n\nThe second half of the 1900s is considered the professional development building era of public relations. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. The Cluetrain Manifesto, which predicted the effect of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.\n\n\"Cosmopolitan\" reported that the average annual salary for a \"public relations director\" was £77,619 in 2017.\n\nPublic relations practitioners typically have a bachelor's degree in journalism, communications, public relations, marketing, or English. Many senior practitioners have advanced degrees; a 2015 survey found that forty-percent of chief communications officers at Fortune 500 companies had master's degrees.\n\nIn 2013, a survey of the 21,000 members of the Public Relations Society of America found that 18-percent held the Accreditation in Public Relations.\n\nThe BLS reports the median annual wage for public relations specialists was $58,020 in 2016. The best-paid 10 percent in the field made approximately $110,560, while the bottom 10 percent made approximately $32,090. According to the 2018 Salary Survey, the median salary for a female was $88,000; for men it was $123,000. Females with five-plus years’ experience also reported much lower compensation than their male counterparts: $100,000 versus $135,000.\n\nAccording to a 2017 survey by Spring Associates, public relations practitioners in the United States private sector – working at PR agencies - earn salaries which range from $54,900 for an early career position as an account executive, to $118,400 for a mid-career position as an account director, to $174,200 for a senior position as an executive vice-president. Those working in the private sector within a company or organization’s PR department earn salaries ranging from $77,600 for an early-career position as a PR specialist, to $149,300 in a mid-career position as a PR director, to $185,000 for a senior position as a vice-president of public relations. Salaries tended to be higher for persons employed in major media markets such as New York and Los Angeles, and lower for those employed in tertiary markets.\n\nThe c-level position of chief communications officer (CCO), used in some private companies, usually earned more than $220,000 annually as of 2013. CCOs at Fortune 200 companies, meanwhile, had an average compensation package of just over $1 million annually, according to a 2009 survey by \"Fortune\"; this amount included base salary, bonus, and stock options.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported public relations specialists had a median annual salary of $59,020 in 2016.\n\nWithin the U.S. federal government, public affairs workers had a 2016 average salary of approximately $101,922, with the U.S. Forest Service employing the most such professionals. Of federal government agencies employing more than one public affairs worker, those at the Federal Aviation Administration earned the most, on average, at approximately $150,130. The highest-earning public affairs worker within the U.S. government, meanwhile, earned $229,333. \n\nSalaries of public relations specialists in local government vary widely. The chief communications officer of the Utah Transit Authority earned $258,165 in total compensation in 2014 while an early-career public information officer for the city of Conway, South Carolina had a pay range beginning at approximately $59,000 per year in 2017.\n\nPublic relations specialist is a job with potential as this specific sector is gauged to increase by 9% from 2016 to 2026, especially as social media usage increases and the need to react quickly after crises occur to continue to create and maintain a favorable public image for the organization they represent. Each sector, state, and job is paid and utilized differently which is why the United States Department of Labor broke down national estimates at each level for people to get a better idea of the job outlooks. \n\nThe national estimates for this occupation are:\n\nPercentage Wage Estimates are:\n\nIndustries with the highest level of employment are:\n\nIndustries with highest level of concentration are:\n\nIndustries with highest level of pay are:\n\nStates with the highest employment level in this occupation:\nPublic relations professionals present the face of an organization or individual, usually to articulate its objectives and official views on issues of relevance, primarily to the media. Public relations contributes to the way an organization is perceived by influencing the media and maintaining relationships with stakeholders. According to Dr. Jacquie L’Etang from Queen Margaret University, public relations professionals can be viewed as \"discourse workers specializing in communication and the presentation of argument and employing rhetorical strategies to achieve managerial aims.\"\n\nSpecific public relations disciplines include:\n\nBuilding and managing relationships with those who influence an organization or individual’s audiences has a central role in doing public relations. After a public relations practitioner has been working in the field, they accumulate a list of relationships that become an asset, especially for those in media relations.\n\nWithin each discipline, typical activities include publicity events, speaking opportunities, press releases, newsletters, blogs, social media, press kits, and outbound communication to members of the press. Video and audio news releases (VNRs and ANRs) are often produced and distributed to TV outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content.\n\nA fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the target audience and to tailor messages to be relevant to each audience. Sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages. These messages however should be relevant to each other, thus creating a consistency to the overall message and theme. Audience targeting tactics are important for public relations practitioners because they face all kinds of problems: low visibility, lack of public understanding, opposition from critics, and insufficient support from funding sources.\n\nOn the other hand, stakeholder theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue. All audiences are stakeholders (or presumptive stakeholders), but not all stakeholders are audiences. For example, if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease, the charity and the people with the disease are stakeholders, but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money. Public relations experts possess deep skills in media relations, market positioning, and branding. They are powerful agents that help clients deliver clear, unambiguous information to a target audience that matters to them.\n\nThe public is any group whose members have a common interest or common values in a particular subject, such as political party. Those members would then be considered stakeholders, which are people who have a stake or an interest in an organization or issue that potentially involves the organization or group they're interested in. The Publics in Public Relations are:\n\n-Traditional Publics: Groups with which you have an on-going and long term relationship with, this may include; Employees, Media, Governments, Investors, and Customers\n\n-Non-Traditional Publics: Groups that are typically unfamiliar with your organization and you have not had a relationship with but may become traditional publics due to changes in the organization, in society or if a group changing event occurs.\n\n-Latent Publics: A group whose values have come into contact with the values of your organization but whose members haven't yet realized it; the members of that public are not yet aware of the relationship.\n\n-Aware Publics: A group of members who are aware of the existence of a commonality of values or interests with your organization, but have not organized or attempted to respond to that commonality.\n\n-Intervening Publics: Any public that helps you send a message to another public, could be the media or someone with stature.\n\n-Primary Publics: If a public can directly affect your organization's pursuit of its values-driven goals. This publics would include media, employees, government, shareholder, financial institutions, and the immediate community.\n\n-Secondary Publics: Have high interest in the company such as the primary publics but will not be directly affected by decisions of the organization.\n\n-Internal Publics: People within your organization\n\n-External Publics: People outside of your organization\n\n-Domestic Publics: Those within your country\n\n-International Publics: Those outside of your country and when communicating with this publics you must be weary of that areas culture, beliefs, values, ethic, and other valuable cultural difference as to not offend anyone.\n\nMessaging is the process of creating a consistent story around: a product, person, company, or service. Messaging aims to avoid having readers receive contradictory or confusing information that will instill doubt in their purchasing choices, or other decisions that affect the company. Brands aim to have the same problem statement, industry viewpoint, or brand perception shared across sources and media.\n\nDigital marketing is the use of Internet tools and technologies such as search engines, Web 2.0 social bookmarking, new media relations, blogging, and social media marketing. Interactive PR allows companies and organizations to disseminate information without relying solely on mainstream publications and communicate directly with the public, customers and prospects.\n\nPR practitioners have always relied on the media such as TV, radio, and magazines, to promote their ideas and messages tailored specifically to a target audience. Social media marketing is not only a new way to achieve that goal, it is also a continuation of a strategy that existed for decades. Lister et al. said that \"Digital media can be seen as a continuation and extension of a principal or technique that was already in place\". \nPR professionals are well aware of the fact that digital technology is used in a practically different way than before. For instance, cellphones are no longer just devices we use to talk to one another. They are also used for online shopping, dating, learning and getting the most up to date news around the world.\n\nAs digital technology has evolved, the methods to measure effective online public relations effectiveness have improved. The Public Relations Society of America, which has been developing PR strategies since 1947, identified 5 steps to measure online public relations effectiveness. \n\nLitigation public relations is the management of the communication process during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its effect on the client’s overall reputation (Haggerty, 2003).\n\nPublic relations professionals both serve the public's interest and private interests of businesses, associations, non-profit organizations, and governments. This dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values. This conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations. In 2000, the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics \"advocacy\" – for the first time – as a core value of the discipline.\n\nThe field of public relations is generally highly un-regulated, but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations. The Chartered Institute of Public Relations, the Public Relations Society of America, and The Institute of Public Relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code. Still, Edelman's 2003 semi-annual trust survey found that only 20 percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible. Public relations people are growing increasingly concerned with their company’s marketing practices, questioning whether they agree with the company’s social responsibility. They seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policy-making role. On the other hand, marketing people are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing.\n\nAccording to Scott Cutlip, the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum, but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate.\n\nThe Public Relation Student Society of America has established a set of fundamental guidelines that people within the public relations professions should practice and use in their business atmosphere. These values are:\n\nAdvocacy: Serving the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for the clientele. This can occur by displaying the marketplace of ideas, facts, and viewpoints to aid informed public debate.\n\nHonesty: Standing by the truth and accuracy of all facts in the case and advancing those statements to the public.\n\nExpertise: To become and stay informed of the specialized knowledge needed in the field of Public Relations. Taking that knowledge and improving the field through development, research, and education. Meanwhile professionals also build their understanding, credibility, and relationships to understand various audiences and industries.\n\nIndependence: Provide unbiased work to those that are represented while being accountable for all actions.\n\nLoyalty: Stay devoted to your client while remembering you have a duty to still serve the public interest.\n\nFairness: Honorably conduct business with any and all clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, media, and general public. Respecting all opinions and right of free expression.\n\nSpin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit that is meant to manipulate the public, but since the 1990s has shifted to describing a \"polishing of the truth.\" Today, spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion. Companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are. Within the field of public relations, spin is seen as a derogatory term, interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation. Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called \"spin doctors.\"\n\nIn Stuart Ewen’s \"PR! A Social History of Spin\", he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless. Corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force. He claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages.\n\nThe techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions (cherry picking), the so-called \"non-denial denial,\" phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths, euphemisms for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful, and ambiguity in public statements. Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news.\n\nNegative public relations, also called dark public relations (DPR) and in some earlier writing \"Black PR\", is a process of destroying the target's reputation and/or corporate identity. The objective in DPR is to discredit someone else, who may pose a threat to the client's business or be a political rival. DPR may rely on IT security, industrial espionage, social engineering, and competitive intelligence. Common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target, producing misleading facts to fool a competitor. In politics, a decision to use negative PR is also known as negative campaigning. Public relations are frequently just recycled information used by a plethora of sources, thus giving way to minimal perspectives regarding events.\n\nIn \"Propaganda\" (1928), Bernays argued that the manipulation of public opinion was a necessary part of democracy. In public relations, lobby groups are created to influence government policy, corporate policy or public opinion, typically in a way that benefits the sponsoring organization.\n\nIn fact, Bernays stresses that we are in fact dominated in almost every aspect of our lives, by a relatively small number of persons who have mastered the ‘mental processes and social patterns of the masses,’ which include our behavior, political and economic spheres or our morals. In theory, each individual chooses his own opinion on behavior and public issues. However, in practice, it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence. This is the reason why the society has agreed upon an ‘invisible government’ to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale.\n\nWhen a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base, it is known as a front group. Front groups are a form of astroturfing, because they intend to sway the public or the government without disclosing their financial connection to corporate or political interests. They create a fake grass-roots movement by giving the appearance of a trusted organization that serves the public, when they actually serve their sponsors.\n\nPoliticians also employ public relations professionals to help project their views, policies, and even personalities to their best advantages.\n\n"}
{"id": "1154853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154853", "title": "Pyrosequencing", "text": "Pyrosequencing\n\nPyrosequencing is a method of DNA sequencing (determining the order of nucleotides in DNA) based on the \"sequencing by synthesis\" principle, in which the sequencing is performed by detecting the nucleotide incorporated by a DNA polymerase. Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction when pyrophosphate is released. Hence, the name pyrosequencing.\n\nThe principle of Pyrosequencing was first described in 1993 by Bertil Pettersson, Mathias Uhlen and Pål Nyren by combining the solid phase sequencing method using streptavidin coated magnetic beads with recombinant DNA polymerase lacking 3´to 5´exonuclease activity (proof-reading) and luminescence detection using the firefly luciferase enzyme. A mixture of three enzymes (DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase and firefly luciferase) and a nucleotide (dNTP) are added to single stranded DNA to be sequenced and the incorporation of nucleotide is followed by measuring the light emitted. The intensity of the light determines if 0, 1 or more nucleotides have been incorporated, thus showing how many complementary nucleotides are present on the template strand. The nucleotide mixture is removed before the next nucleotide mixture is added. This process is repeated with each of the four nucleotides until the DNA sequence of the single stranded template is determined.\n\nA second solution-based method for Pyrosequencing was described in 1998 by Mostafa Ronaghi, Mathias Uhlen and Pål Nyren. In this alternative method, an additional enzyme apyrase is introduced to remove nucleotides that are not incorporated by the DNA polymerase. This enabled the enzyme mixture including the DNA polymerase, the luciferase and the apyrase to be added at the start and kept throughout the procedure, thus providing a simple set-up suitable for automation. An automated instrument based on this principle was introduced to the market the following year by the company Pyrosequencing.\n\nA third microfluidic variant of the Pyrosequencing method was described in 2005 by Jonathan Rothberg and co-workers at the company 454 Life Sciences. This alternative approach for Pyrosequencing was based on the original principle of attaching the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support and they showed that sequencing could be performed in a highly parallel manner using a microfabricated microarray. This allowed for high-throughput DNA sequencing and an automated instrument was introduced to the market. This became the first next generation sequencing instrument starting a new era in genomics research, with rapidly falling prices for DNA sequencing allowing whole genome sequencing at affordable prices.\n\n\"Sequencing by synthesis\" involves taking a single strand of the DNA to be sequenced and then synthesizing its complementary strand enzymatically. The pyrosequencing method is based on detecting the activity of DNA polymerase (a DNA synthesizing enzyme) with another chemoluminescent enzyme. Essentially, the method allows sequencing a single strand of DNA by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step. The template DNA is immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides are sequentially added and removed from the reaction. Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template. The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template.\n\nFor the solution-based version of Pyrosequencing, the single-strand DNA (ssDNA) template is hybridized to a sequencing primer and incubated with the enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase and apyrase, and with the substrates adenosine 5´ phosphosulfate (APS) and luciferin.\n\nCurrently, a limitation of the method is that the lengths of individual reads of DNA sequence are in the neighborhood of 300-500 nucleotides, shorter than the 800-1000 obtainable with chain termination methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing). This can make the process of genome assembly more difficult, particularly for sequences containing a large amount of repetitive DNA. Lack of proof-reading activity limits accuracy of this method.\n\nThe company Pyrosequencing AB in Uppsala, Sweden was founded with venture capital provided by HealthCap in order to commercialize machinery and reagents for sequencing short stretches of DNA using the pyrosequencing technique. Pyrosequencing AB was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1999. It was renamed to Biotage in 2003. The pyrosequencing business line was acquired by Qiagen in 2008. Pyrosequencing technology was further licensed to 454 Life Sciences. 454 developed an array-based pyrosequencing technology which emerged as a platform for large-scale DNA sequencing, including genome sequencing and metagenomics.\n\nRoche announced the discontinuation of the 454 sequencing platform in 2013 when its technology became noncompetitive.\n"}

{"id": "13562782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13562782", "title": "Rex Heslop", "text": "Rex Heslop\n\nRex Wesley Heslop, (1905 – September 30, 1973) was a Canadian businessman noted for being a land developer and residential real estate developer.\n\nHeslop was born on a farm in present-day Northern Etobicoke. The property would have been located North of the 401 and East of Islington Avenue—note that neither road existed in 1905.\n\nHe worked with his father in the family construction business before moving to Detroit to seek opportunity. In Detroit, he drove a cab for a time; then he became a new car salesman. After his tenure in Detroit, he went to Northern Ontario, working in the mines, until he was injured in a rock slide at which point he moved back to Toronto to work in construction.\n\nHeslop was married and had two children.\n\nHeslop returned to Toronto. There was a major housing shortage with the veterans coming home from WW2. About 1947-48, he acquired a small piece of land on the southeast corner of Foch and Horner Ave. across from Sir Adam Beck Public School. On this property, he built three houses using a precast concrete wall system. They sold immediately.\n\nAbout 1949, he purchased the west half of a farm on the north side of Horner Ave., west of, but not connected to Brown's Line. It was subdivided into lots approximately 40 feet by 140 feet in size, and in five locations he designed L-shaped the streets. He built a mixture of homes, brick and precast concrete, bungalows and story-and-halfs, two, three and four bedrooms. It was very rare for the Toronto area at that time to find a subdivision that was not on perfectly straight streets and where all the houses were not identical to each other. Street names were all English locations like Chelsea Dr., Fulham Dr., Norfolk Dr., etc., except for one street called Heslop Dr.\n\nFrom the major success of that development, Heslop moved on by buying the east half of the same farm, including the old farmhouse (renovated and located on east side of Radlett Ave.). He repeated the development formula of the first phase, incorporating three more L-shaped streets, but no longer offering the four-bedroom house models. A couple of streets now connected both subdivisions to Brown's Line. The longest north-south street is called Delma Dr., his wife's first name.\n\nLand from both subdivisions was incorporated into one large park, bounded by Delma, Mitcham, Fulham and Eltham that Heslop gave to Etobicoke. Later, the municipality sectioned off the most easterly part of that park and sold it to Alderwood United Church for their new building in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1955 Heslop purchased farmland again, this time in the northern part of Etobicoke known at the time as Thistletown for a cost of $110,000. Water mains, streets and sewers were constructed, as well as houses which were listed for sale at either $9,000 or $10,000. The homes sold well, and soon 330 families were living in the development named \"Rexdale\". In 1956, Heslop opened the Rexdale Shopping Centre (now Rexdale Mall). By then, 70 industries and 3,600 homes were located in Rexdale.\n\nHeslop, the developer of Rexdale in Etobicoke, had purchased several farms on Georgetown's eastern boundary in 1954. By 1958, he and his wife Delma and their two children - Marilyn and Rex Jr. - had moved into their brand new spacious home on Heslop Court.\n\nHeslop then tried a similar venture to Rexdale, but this time in Georgetown by creating another subdivision, this one called Delrex. He ran into political problems and tired of name-calling and in-fighting, sold his interest and retired at the age of 61.\n\nRexdale, Ontario and the Delrex subdivision (area south of Highway 7 between Maple Avenue and Mountainview Road South) of Georgetown, Ontario are named after him. Various streets in Delrex named after him and his family (i.e. Rexway Drive, Heslop Court, Delrex Boulevard, Marilyn Crescent), and founded a line of Rex Heslops which currently ends with RCN sailor Rex Heslop III.\n\n"}
{"id": "11735150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11735150", "title": "SME finance", "text": "SME finance\n\nSME finance is the funding of small and medium-sized enterprises, and represents a major function of the general business finance market – in which capital for different types of firms are supplied, acquired, and costed or priced. Capital is supplied through the business finance market in the form of bank loans and overdrafts; leasing and hire-purchase arrangements; equity/corporate bond issues; venture capital or private equity; asset-based finance such as factoring and invoice discounting, and government funding in the form of grants or loans. \n\nHowever, not all business finance is external/commercially supplied through the market. Much finance is internally generated by businesses out of their own earnings and/or supplied informally as trade credit, that is, delays in paying for purchases of goods and services.\n\nThe economic and banking importance of the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is well recognized in academic and policy literature. It is also acknowledged that these actors in the economy may be under-served, especially in terms of finance. This has led to significant debate on the best methods to serve this sector.\nAlthough there have been numerous schemes and programmes in different economic environments, there are a number of distinctive recurring approaches to SME finance.\n\n\nA substantial portion of the SME sector may not have the security required for conventional collateral based bank lending, nor high enough returns to attract formal venture capitalists and other risk investors. In addition, markets may be characterized by deficient information (limiting the effectiveness of financial statement-based lending and credit scoring). This has led to claims of an \"SME finance gap\" or Nano gap– particularly in emerging economies. At a workshop hosted by The Network for Governance, Entrepreneurship & Development (GE&D) in Geneva in July 2008, SMEs that fall into this category have been defined as Small Growing Businesses (SGBs).\n\nThere have been at least two distinctive approaches to try to overcome the so-called SME finance gap.\n\nThe first has been to broaden the collateral based approach by encouraging bank lenders to finance SMEs with insufficient collateral. This might be done through an external party providing the collateral or guarantees required. Unfortunately, such schemes are counter to basic free market principles, and they tend to be unsustainable. This sector is increasingly called the Meso-finance sector.\n\nHowever, there are no evidence of any significant structural barriers to the supply of bank or private equity finance to suitable SME applicants on mutually satisfactory terms and conditions in Britain. The main obstacles to funding here appear to be on the demand rather than the supply side of the business finance market. This is mainly in the form of:\n\n\nThus, the second approach has been to broaden the viability based approach. Since the viability based approach is concerned with the business itself, the aim has been to provide better general business development assistance to reduce risk and increase returns. This often entails a detailed review and assistance with the business plan.\n\nA common aim or feature of the viability based approach is the provision of appropriate finance that is tailored to the cash flows of the SME.\n\nAlthough the returns generated by this approach in less developed countries may not be attractive to venture capitalists, they can be significantly better than conventional collateral based lending – whilst at the same time being less risky than the typical venture capitalist business. Thus, a new, distinct asset class, offering a new avenue for diversification, is available to investors. With higher profitability than traditional SME finance and lower risk than traditional venture capital, this sector has been named the \"growth finance sector\".\n\nIn the past, a significant obstacle to applying this approach in less developed countries has been getting the information required to assess viability, plus the costs of transferring and providing business development assistance. However, in the last several years, improved information and communications technology have made the process easier and cheaper. As technology and information sharing continue to improve, the approach could become significantly more cost-effective and attractive to established financiers with viability based approaches, and to consultants providing business development assistance to SMEs in other, more mainstream areas.\n\nSome investors have promoted this approach as a means of achieving wider social benefits, while others have been interested in developing it largely in order to generate better financial-economic returns for shareholders, investors, employees, and clients.\n\nA new organisation, Aspen Network for Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE), has been created to bring the growth finance stakeholders together, with the view to evolve into an association serving the sector, similar to what venture capital or microfinance associations do. They have declared their target audience to be Small Growing Businesses.\n\nIn 2008, a group of financial service providers and other stakeholders came together to form the Finance Alliance for Sustainable Trade (FAST). FAST is an association of financial service providers explicitly committed to improving access to finance for sustainable SMEs—defined as SMEs that are compliant with one or more of a host of growing sustainability standards (such as organics, fair trade, forest stewardship council etc.).\n\nThe effective management of lending to SMEs can contribute significantly to the overall growth and profitability of banks. There has been considerable research and analysis into the methods by which banks assess and monitor business loans, manage business financing risks, and price their products – and how these methods might be further developed and improved.\nThere has been particularly intensive scrutiny of the kinds of business financial information that banks use in making lending decisions, and how reliable that information actually is.\n\nBanks have traditionally relied on a combination of documentary sources of information, interviews and visits, and the personal knowledge and expertise of managers in assessing and monitoring business loans. However, when assessing comparatively small and straightforward business credit applications, banks may largely rely on standardized credit scoring techniques (quantifying such things as the characteristics, assets, and cash flows of businesses/owners). Using such techniques – and also centralizing or rationalizing business-banking operations generally – can significantly reduce processing costs. Standardized computer-based assessment may also be more accurate and fairer than reliance on the personal judgments of local bank managers. As a result, banks may now be able to offer more loans, faster and in larger amounts, and reduce previously high security requirements.\n\nHowever, business lending as a whole is substantially more diverse and complex than personal and residential mortgage lending. This, coupled with the large size and inherently risky nature of many business loans, tend to limit the scope and desirability of computerized credit scoring in assessment and monitoring.\n\nScottish Government make available funding for small and medium sized enterprises in order to help them reduce resource usage (in particular energy) and lessen carbon impacts. The Scottish Government SME Loan Fund is unsecured and interest free (loans for renewable technologies are charged at 5% due to the Renewable Heat Incentive.\n\n"}

She was honored with a 2012 Positively Powerful Women award for Philanthropic Leadership, by the Phoenix Business Journal as one of 2013's 25 Dynamic Women in Business, and most recently honored by National Bank of Arizona with the 2013 Woman of the Year award and Arizona Business Magazine as one of the 50 most Influential Women in Arizona Business.\n\nSharon Lechter graduated from Florida State University with an Accounting degree and \"magna cum laude\" honors.\nShe worked for a short while with a small accounting firm called \"Big Eight\". In the 1980s, Letcher and her husband husband Michael met Robert Kiyosaki and together formed the Rich Dad companies. Letcher claims to have held various management positions with unnamed computer, insurance and publishing companies while maintaining her credentials as a professional CPA. \nShe met her husband Michael Lechter in 1980.\n\nAfter co-founding the Rich Dad companies, Lechter spent 11 years on the managerial board. In June 2007, Lechter resigned from the managerial board of the Rich Dad companies to further pursue her passion with children's education and financial literacy.\n\n\"\"Our current educational system has not been able to keep pace with the global and technological changes in the world today,\" Lechter said. \"Money is a life skill. We must teach our young people the skills - both scholastic and financial - that they need to not only survive, but to thrive in the world.\"\"\n\nToday, she is actively engaged in several business ventures, curriculum, councils and media opportunities to advance financial literacy across the nation.\n\nMichael A. Lechter is an intellectual property lawyer, President and CEO of Tech Press, author, investor and entrepreneur. Michael has been practicing law as a patent attorney since the early 1970s. Among his other duties, Michael is an adjunct professor at Arizona State University, counsel to the international law firm of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey, LLP and former Rich Dad Advisor.\n\nHe is the author of several books including \"Protecting Your #1 Asset, Creating Fortunes from Your Ideas, An Intellectual Property Handbook\", \"OPM: How to Attract Other People's Money for Your Investments - The Ultimate Leverage\", editor of \"Successful Patents and Patenting for Engineers and Scientists\" and contributing author to the \"Encyclopedia of Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Licensing Best Practices: The LESI Guide To Strategic Issues and Contemporary Realities\".\n\nMichael maintains a column in an online company called Inc.com where he gives practical advice on a variety of different topics from protecting your assets to intellectual property.\n\nIn 2007 Lechter created \"a company dedicated to empowering children and families to build prosperous futures through financial literacy education.\"\n\nYOUTHpreneur launched in 2008 to \"ignite the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, today!\" YOUTHpreneur is a brand of products and services under the Pay Your Family First company. The brand features a business kit designed to teach children the basics of money management and how to operate an independent business. \"My Biz Kit\" includes both parent and youth guides, a resource guide, a tote bag, calculator, stationary, business cards and more. YOUTHpreneur also sells a branded gumball machine designed to be used as a \"starter business\" for those not looking to go out and create their own.\n\n\"ThriveTime for Teens\" is a board game under the Pay Your Family First company. The game is designed to teach teenage children financial skills by placing them in real life money and life decisions such as buying a car, giving to charity, using credit cards, buying or starting a business and more. Players have 15 game-time hours per game week of \"BIZtime\" in which they must decide what new activities or part-time work they will engage in. Players advance through the game with \"Thrive Score.\" Thrive Score increases by making financially good decisions and decreases with bad ones. Players receive game sheets with income, expenditures, assets and liabilities to total their progress.\n\nOn October 6, 2009, Lechter's published \"Think and Grow Rich: Three Feet from Gold\". The narrative follows the story of a young writer who interviews many of today's business leaders and other influential figures about the importance of persistence in obtaining your goals. The book advocates finding your own Success Formula, choosing good counsel and above all: never giving up.\n\nSharon Lechter has co-authored over a dozen different books under the Rich Dad brand with Robert Kiyosaki and coordinated or edited another 10 with the Rich Dad companies. She is one of three founding partners of the series of companies that fall under the Rich Dad brand with Robert Kiyosaki and Kim Kiyosaki. Robert Kiyosaki once said of Sharon Lechter that, \n\n\"“Sharon is one of the few natural entrepreneurs I have ever met. In The Rich Dad Company, I am the horn and Sharon is the engine.\"\"\nAt the Rich Dad companies Sharon claimed credit for developing several board games, audio cassettes, seminars, CDs and interactive Web sites. She claims to be the co-inventor of the Cashflow for Kids board game and spearheaded the launch of Rich Dad's interactive Web site for kids. However, the companies' most well-known work is their very first book and the #1 \"New York Times\" bestseller \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\".\n\nIn 2012, Robert Kiyosaki is re-releasing all Rich Dad books, removing Sharon Lechter's name as co-author and putting his picture on all covers.\n\nOriginally self-published by TechPress, Inc. before being picked up by Warner Books and becoming a bestseller, the story line follows anecdotal advice and lessons Robert Kiyosaki learned from his \"two fathers\" growing up in Hawaii. Robert's \"rich dad\" (his best friend's father) and his \"poor dad\" (his biological father) offer very different advice on how to live his life and earn a living. The anecdotal comparison of his \"rich dad\" and \"poor dad\" provide the basis for the book and later brand. His \"poor dad\" was the superintendent of the Hawaii State Department of Education and a well-educated man. However, Kiyosaki demonstrates that because he followed the traditional path of \"get a good education to get a good job\" he was constantly in debt later in life and had very little real net worth. In opposition to this is his \"rich dad\" who never even finished the 8th grade but became \"the richest man in Hawaii\" by investing his smaller income in a few good money producing investments. \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" is designed to challenge the way in which most people view money and how to make money work for you, instead of working for your money.\n\nThe rest of the Rich Dad books enforce these basic principles and ideas but elaborate on them within specific groups, time frames or opportunities.\n\nWarner Bros./Hachette Publishing - \"Sharon Lechter as co-author with Robert Kiyosaki\"\n\n\"Sharon Lechter as author with co-author Garrett Sutton\"\n\nLittle Brown/Hachette Publishing - \"Sharon Lechter as co-author with Robert Kiyosaki\"\n\nVideoPlus - \"Sharon Lechter as co-author with Robert Kiyosaki\"\n\nRich Publishing - \"Donald Trump and Robert Kiyosaki with Sharon Lechter and Meredith McIver as co-authors\"\n\nWarner Bros./Hachette \n\nLechter takes credit for adapting Rich Dad's Cashflow 101 board game for children. Cashflow for Kids, designed for children ages 5 to 9, aims to teach the very basic principles and concepts of investing and making money.\n\nThe game is broken into two stages, the \"rat race\" and \"the fast track.\" Kids must first raise their income above their expenses before they can escape the first stage of the game. In the second stage they must achieve the \"dream\" goal of $50,000 in monthly cash flow with the first to reach this goal declared the winner.\n\nKids learn hands on and by themselves how to invest and the difference between an asset and a liability. In place of \"score cards\" there are financial statements. Kids can see first hand what their money is going into.\n\nOn October 12, 2007, Sharon Lechter filed suit against \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" co-author Robert Kiyosaki in Clark County, NV (Civil Case # 07-A-549886-C). On September 4, 2008 the Lechters and Kiyosakis reached a settlement in their lawsuit.\n\nThe main goal of Kiyosaki's anecdotal lessons in the Rich Dad series of books is to create financially literate and aware persons who can support themselves on their investments alone, rather than running the \"rat race\" and living paycheck to paycheck. To do this they advocate investments such as real estate and small businesses. They clearly define the difference between an asset and a liability. Kiyosaki defines \"assets\" as things that generate money, such as rental properties or businesses and \"liabilities\" as things that cost money, such as house payments, cars and so on. Financial leverage is also a key component towards becoming rich. Lechter advocates learning to take existing infrastructures and systems and applying them to your project.\n\nLechter stresses what she calls \"financial literacy\" as the means to obtaining wealth. She says that life skills are often best learned through experience and that there are important lessons not taught in school.\n\nLechter and Kiyosaki speak often of what they call \"The Cashflow Quadrant,\" a conceptual tool that aims to describe how all the money in the world is earned. Depicted in a diagram, this concept entails four groupings, split with two lines (one vertical and one horizontal). In each of the four groups there is a letter representing a way in which an individual may earn income. The letters are as follows. \n\nFor those on the left side of the divide (\"E\" and \"S\"), Lechter and Kiyosaki say that they may never obtain true wealth. Conversely, those on the right side of the divide (\"B\" and \"I\") are supposedly following the road to true wealth.\n\nSharon Lechter's true passion is financial literacy, especially for woman in business, children and families. During her time at the Rich Dad companies she worked to advance and develop a variety of media for children and teens including; Rich Dad, Poor Dad for \"Teens\", Rich Kid Smart Kid Web site and the board game Cashflow for Kids.\n\nIn January, 2008, Sharon Lechter was appointed to the President's Council on Financial Literacy in a ceremony held in the Roosevelt room at the White House in Washington, D.C.\n\nLechter and the council, composed of 19 members from the business, faith and non-profit communities work to shape the course for a financially literate nation. The council is charged to gather information about financial literacy and its condition in the U.S., recommend improvements to national policies to the President and the Treasury secretary and \"assist the American people in understanding and addressing financial matters.\"\n\n\"“We want people to own assets; we want people to be able to manage their assets,” said President Bush in his remarks. “We want people to understand basic financial concepts, and how credit cards work and how credit scores affect you, how you can benefit from a savings account or a bank account. That's what we want. And this group of citizens has taken the lead, and I thank them.”\"\n\nMembers of the council include;\n\n\nA committed philanthropist, Lechter also gives back to world communities as both a volunteer and benefactor. Her dedication to her principles, ideas and convictions has landed her numerous awards and placed her on several committees.\n\n\n\nSharon was also honored in 2013 by the Business Journal as one of their 25 Dynamic Women in Business and by AZ Business magazine as one of the 50 Most Influential Women in AZ Business\n\n"}
{"id": "255475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=255475", "title": "Stress management", "text": "Stress management\n\nStress management is a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person's level of stress, especially chronic stress, usually for the purpose of improving everyday functioning. In this context, the term 'stress' refers only to a stress with significant negative consequences, or distress in the terminology advocated by Hans Selye, rather than what he calls eustress, a stress whose consequences are helpful or otherwise.\n\nStress produces numerous physical and mental symptoms which vary according to each individual's situational factors. These can include physical health decline as well as depression. The process of stress management is named as one of the keys to a happy and successful life in modern society. Although life provides numerous demands that can prove difficult to handle, stress management provides a number of ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.\n\nDespite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measurable, using various physiological tests, similar to those used in polygraphs.\n\nMany practical stress management techniques are available, some for use by health professionals and others, for self-help, which may help an individual reduce their levels of stress, provide positive feelings of control over one's life and promote general well-being. Other stress reducing techniques involve adding a daily exercise routine, finding a hobby, writing your thoughts, feelings, and moods down and also speaking with a trusted one about what is bothering you. It is very important to keep in mind that not all techniques are going to work the same for everyone, that is why trying different stress managing techniques is crucial in order to find what techniques work best for you. An example of this would be, two people on a roller coaster one can be screaming grabbing on to the bar while the other could be laughing while their hands are up in the air (Nisson). This is a perfect example of how stress effects everyone differently that is why they might need a different treatment. These techniques do not require doctors approval but seeing if a doctors technique works better for you is also very important. \n\nEvaluating the effectiveness of various stress management techniques can be difficult, as limited research currently exists. Consequently, the amount and quality of evidence for the various techniques varies widely. Some are accepted as effective treatments for use in psychotherapy, while others with less evidence favoring them are considered alternative therapies. Many professional organizations exist to promote and provide training in conventional or alternative therapies.\n\nThere are several models of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress. Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.\n\nWalter Cannon and Hans Selye used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress. They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures, then extrapolated from these studies to human beings.\n\nSubsequent studies of stress in humans by Richard Rahe and others established the view that stress is caused by distinct, measurable life stressors, and further, that these life stressors can be ranked by the median degree of stress they produce (leading to the Holmes and Rahe stress scale). Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead their effect is mediated by the individual's perceptions, capacities, and understanding.\n\nThe generalized models are:\n\nRichard Lazarus and Susan Folkman suggested in 1981 that stress can be thought of as resulting from an \"imbalance between demands and resources\" or as occurring when \"pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope\". Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather one's resources and ability to cope mediate the stress response and are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.\n\nAmong the many stressors mentioned by employees, these are the most common:\n\nIn order to develop an effective stress management program it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress, and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman's interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model contends that stress may not be a stressor if the person does not perceive the stressor as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging. Also, if the person possesses or can use adequate coping skills, then stress may not actually be a result or develop because of the stressor. The model proposes that people can be taught to manage their stress and cope with their stressors. They may learn to change their perspective of the stressor and provide them with the ability and confidence to improve their lives and handle all of types of stressors.\n\nThe health realization/innate health model of stress is also founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. Instead of focusing on the individual's appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person's thought processes that determine the response to potentially stressful external circumstances. In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one's circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of well-being results from approaching the world with a \"quiet mind\".\n\nThis model proposes that helping stressed individuals understand the nature of thought—especially providing them with the ability to recognize when they are in the grip of insecure thinking, disengage from it, and access natural positive feelings—will reduce their stress.\n\nHigh demand levels load the person with extra effort and work. A new time schedule is worked up, and until the period of abnormally high, personal demand has passed, the normal frequency and duration of former schedules is limited.\n\nMany techniques cope with the stresses life brings. Some of the following ways reduce a lower than usual stress level, temporarily, to compensate the biological issues involved; others face the stressor at a higher level of abstraction:\n\nTechniques of stress management will vary according to the philosophical paradigm.\n\nAlthough many techniques have traditionally been developed to deal with the consequences of stress, considerable research has also been conducted on the prevention of stress, a subject closely related to psychological resilience-building. A number of self-help approaches to stress-prevention and resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n\nLevels of stress can be measured. One way is through the use of psychological testing: \"The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale\" [two scales of measuring stress] is used to rate stressful life events, while the DASS [Depression Anxiety Stress Scales] contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in blood pressure and galvanic skin response can also be measured to test stress levels, and changes in stress levels. A digital thermometer can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the fight-or-flight response drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual. This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic.\n\nStress management has physiological and immune benefits.\n\nPositive outcomes are observed using a combination of non-drug interventions:\n\nAcute stress is the most common form of stress among humans worldwide.\n\nAcute stress deals with the pressures of the near future or dealing with the very recent past. This type of stress is often misinterpreted for being a negative connotation. While this is the case in some circumstances, it is also a good thing to have some acute stress in life. Running or any other form of exercise is considered an acute stressor. Some exciting or exhilarating experiences such as riding a roller coaster is an acute stress but is usually very enjoyable. Acute stress is a short term stress and as a result, does not have enough time to do the damage that long term stress causes.\n\nChronic stress is unlike acute stress. It has a wearing effect on people that can become a very serious health risk if it continues over a long period of time. Chronic stress can lead to memory loss, damage spatial recognition and produce a decreased drive of eating. The severity varies from person to person and also gender difference can be an underlying factor. Women are able to take longer durations of stress than men without showing the same maladaptive changes. Men can deal with shorter stress duration better than women can but once males hit a certain threshold, the chances of them developing mental issues increases drastically.\n\nStress in the workplace is a commonality throughout the world in every business. Managing that stress becomes vital in order to keep up job performance as well as relationship with co-workers and employers. For some workers, changing the work environment relieves work stress. Making the environment less competitive between employees decreases some amounts of stress. However, each person is different and some people like the pressure to perform better.\n\nSalary can be an important concern of employees. Salary can affect the way people work because they can aim for promotion and in result, a higher salary. This can lead to chronic stress.\n\nCultural differences have also shown to have some major effects on stress coping problems. Eastern Asian employees may deal with certain work situations differently from how a Western North American employee would.\n\nIn order to manage stress in the workplace, employers can provide stress managing programs such as therapy, communication programs, and a more flexible work schedule.\n\nA study was done on the stress levels in general practitioners and hospital consultants in 1999. Over 500 medical employees participated in this study done by R.P Caplan. These results showed that 47% of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress. 27% of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed. These numbers came to a surprise to Dr. Caplan and it showed how alarming the large number of medical workers become stressed out because of their jobs. Managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves. An eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54% of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital. Although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world, Caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals.\n\nMany businesses today have begun to use stress management programs for employees who are having trouble adapting to stress at the workplace or at home. Some companies provide special equipments adapting to stress at the workplace to their employees, like coloring diaries and stress relieving gadgets. Many people have spill over stress from home into their working environment. There are a couple of ways businesses today try to alleviate stress on their employees. One way is individual intervention. This starts off by monitoring the stressors in the individual. After monitoring what causes the stress, next is attacking that stressor and trying to figure out ways to alleviate them in any way. Developing social support is vital in individual intervention, being with others to help you cope has proven to be a very effective way to avoid stress. Avoiding the stressors altogether is the best possible way to get rid of stress but that is very difficult to do in the workplace. Changing behavioral patterns, may in turn, help reduce some of the stress that is put on at work as well.\n\nEmployee assistance programs can include in-house counseling programs on managing stress. Evaluative research has been conducted on EAPs that teach individual stress control and inoculation techniques such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive restructuring. Studies show that these programs can reduce the level of physiological arousal associated with high stress. Participants who master behavioral and cognitive stress-relief techniques report less tension, fewer sleep disturbances, and an improved ability to cope with workplace stressors.\n\nAnother way of reducing stress at work is by simply changing the workload for an employee. Some may be too overwhelmed that they have so much work to get done, or some also may have such little work that they are not sure what to do with themselves at work. Improving communications between employees also sounds like a simple approach, but it is very effective for helping reduce stress. Sometimes making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, such as giving them a voice in bigger situations shows that you trust them and value their opinion. Having all the employees mesh well together is a very underlying factor which can take away much of workplace stress. If employees fit well together and feed off of each other, the chances of lots of stress is very minimal. Lastly, changing the physical qualities of the workplace may reduce stress. Changing things such as the lighting, air temperature, odor, and up to date technology.\n\nIntervention is broken down into three steps: primary, secondary, tertiary. Primary deals with eliminating the stressors altogether. Secondary deals with detecting stress and figuring out ways to cope with it and improving stress management skills. Finally, tertiary deals with recovery and rehabbing the stress altogether. These three steps are usually the most effective way to deal with stress not just in the workplace, but overall.\n\nAviation is a high-stress industry, given that it requires a high level of precision at all times. Chronically high stress levels can ultimately decrease performance and compromise safety. To be effective, stress measurement tools must be specific to the aviation industry, given its unique working environment and other stressors. Stress measurement in aviation seeks to quantify the psychological stress experienced by aviators, with the goal of making needed improvements to aviators' coping and stress management skills.\n\nTo more precisely measure stress, aviators' many responsibilities are broken down into \"workloads.\" This helps to categorise the broad concept of \"stress\" by specific stressors. Additionally, since different workloads may pose unique stressors, this method may be more effective than measuring stress levels as a whole. Stress measurement tools can then help aviators identify which stressors are most problematic for them, and help them improve on managing workloads, planning tasks, and coping with stress more effectively.\n\nTo evaluate workload, a number of tools can be used. The major types of measurement tools are:\n\nImplementation of evaluation tools requires time, instruments for measurement, and software for collecting data.\n\nThe most commonly used stress measurement systems are primarily rating scale-based. These systems tend to be complex, containing multiple levels with a variety of sections, to attempt to capture the many stressors present in the aviation industry. Different systems may be utilised in different operational specialties.\n\n\nEarly pilot stress report systems were adapted and modified from existing psychological questionnaires and surveys. The data from these pilot-specific surveys is then processed and analyzed through an aviation-focused system or scale. Pilot-oriented questionnaires are generally designed to study work stress or home stress. Self-report can also be used to measure a combination of home stress, work stress, and perceived performance. A study conducted by Fiedler, Della Rocco, Schroeder and Nguyen (2000) used Sloan and Cooper's modification of the Alkov questionnaire to explore aviators' perceptions of the relationship between different types of stress. The results indicated that pilots believed performance was impaired when home stress carried over to the work environment. The degree of home stress that carried over to work environment was significantly and negatively related to flying performance items, such as planning, control, and accuracy of landings. The questionnaire was able to reflect pilots' retroactive perceptions and the accuracy of these perceptions.\n\nAlkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor started a 22-item questionnaire for U.S. Naval aviators in 1982 to test the hypothesis that inadequate stress coping strategies contributed to flight mishaps. The questionnaire consists of items related to lifestyle changes and personality characteristics. After completing the questionnaire, the test group is divided into two groups: \"at-fault\" with mishap, and \"not-at-fault\" in a mishap. Then, questionnaires from these two groups were analyzed to examine differences. A study of British commercial airline pilots, conducted by Sloan and Cooper (1986), surveyed 1,000 pilot members from the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA). They used a modified version of Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor's questionnaire to collect data on pilots' perceptions of the relationship between stress and performance. Being a subjective measure, this study's data was based on pilots' perceptions, and thus rely on how accurately they recall past experiences their relationships to stress. Despite relying on subjective perceptions and memories, the study showed that pilot reports are noteworthy.\n\nBeck Depression Inventory (BDI) is another scale used in many industries, including the mental health professions, to screen for depressive symptoms.\nParsa and Kapadia (1997) used the BDI to survey a group of 57 U.S. Air Force fighter pilots who had flown combat operations. The adaptation of the BDI to the aviation field was problematic. However, the study revealed some unexpected findings. The results indicated that 89% of the pilots reported insomnia; 86% reported irritability; 63%, dissatisfaction; 38%, guilt; and 35%, loss of libido. 50% of two squadrons and 33% of another squadron scored above 9 on the BDI, suggesting at least low levels of depression. Such measurement may be difficult to interpret accurately.\n"}
{"id": "21924100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21924100", "title": "The Journal of Commerce", "text": "The Journal of Commerce\n\nThe Journal of Commerce is a biweekly magazine published in the United States that focuses on global trade topics. First published in 1827 in New York, the \"Journal\" has a circulation of approximately 15,000. It provides editorial content to manage day-to-day international logistics and shipping need, covering the areas of cargo and freight transportation, export and import, global transport logistics and trade, international supply chain management and U.S. custom regulations.\n\nIn 1827, Arthur Tappan and Samuel Morse decided that New York needed another newspaper. The \"Journal of Commerce\" operated two deepwater schooners to intercept incoming vessels and get stories ahead of the competition. Following Morse's invention of the telegraph, the \"JoC\" was a founding member of the Associated Press, now the world's largest news-gathering organization.\n\nPublications in the 19th century took positions on political issues and were rarely concerned with being impartial. The \"JoC\" weighed in on the biggest issue of the day — slavery. Gerard Hallock and David Hale, partners in the \"JoC\", were opponents of slavery but also critics of the abolitionists, and they decried the tactics of the war wing of the Republican Party.\nAfter the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the postmaster general suspended the paper's mail privileges, effectively interrupting its publication, on grounds of \"disloyalty.\" Hallock challenged this decision but failed to have it overturned. With its evening edition suspended and the morning edition distributed only to non-postal subscribers, editor Gerard Hallock stepped down on August 31, 1861. David M Stone, head of the commercial news department, and William Cowper, took over his interest in the Journal \nThree years later, President Abraham Lincoln ordered the JoC closed after it was among New York papers victimized by a bogus story quoting the president as calling for 400,000 more volunteers.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, David Stone and William C. Prime, a lawyer who invested part of his fortune in the paper converted the paper from a partnership into a corporation. Prime soon retired to become president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Though continuing as one of the lead investors, Prime left Stone in sole control. Stone devoted himself to the paper, writing most of the editorials and many of the page one stories.\n\nBut he neglected the paper's physical plant, allowing its technology to become outdated. Type was still set by hand in an era when most papers had switched over to linotype machines. The paper lost ground to its competitors, including the \"Daily Commercial Bulletin\", founded in 1865 and owned by William Dodsworth, a friend of Stone's. But unlike his friend, Dodsworth believed it was more important to invest earnings in plant and equipment than to pay it out to investors.\n\nIn 1893, Prime and Stone agreed to sell the \"JoC\" to Dodsworth and merge it with the \"Commercial Bulletin\". Though Dodsworth was the acquirer, he retained the \"JoC\"'s name. The new paper became \"The Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin\", a name that was to be maintained through the 1990s.\n\nThe merged paper benefited enormously from the \"Commercial\"'s new presses and linotype machines, each of which could replace three or four men setting type by hand, one letter at a time. The papers also had complementary advertising support. The Commercial drew advertising from the grocery and provisions business, from insurance and banking. The JoC's coverage focused on shipping and chemicals, textiles and insurance.\n\nWhen Dodsworth took over, he immediately laid off most members of both staffs. He didn't want writers who couldn't write on the newfangled typewriting machines or compositors who couldn't run linotypes.\n\nAfter the 1907 panic, a young editor at \"The Journal of Commerce\", H. Parker Willis, became a leader in the drive to establish a Central Bank. He teamed up with Carter Glass, the Virginia senator, to write the Federal Reserve Act. Much of the work was done in the offices of the JoC.\n\nThroughout its history, the JoC maintained a different perspective on the news. Coverage of major events, such as the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and the U.S. entry into World War I, emphasized the effect on business. During World War II, the JoC reprinted and indexed the wartime regulations that controlled production and supplies.\n\nThe JoC's profits boomed during World War I with a sharp increase in advertising and circulation related to the wartime industrial expansion. The growth continued into the early 1920s. Then in 1921, the Dodsworths sold the paper to William C. Reick, who acquired it with money put up by Charles A. Stoneham, the wealthy owner of racehorses and the New York Giants. After Reick died in 1924, Stoneham appointed a new front man, Raphael Govin, who pushed the JoC into more sports coverage.\n\nWillis, who had become editor-in-chief of the \"JoC\" in 1919, watched with alarm as the paper's profits began to dwindle, when everyone else in the Roaring Twenties was making money. After Govin died and the JoC appeared to be on the verge of extinction, the paper was purchased in 1927 by the three Ridder brothers: Bernard H., Joseph E. and Victor F. They were the sons of Herman Ridder, the publisher of the German-language \"Staats Zeitung\", the \"New York Herald\" and the \"Long Island Press\".\n\nThe outbreak of World War II dramatically affected financial and commodity markets. The Ridder brothers soon built a newspaper empire of their own. They sold the JoC's AP franchise, which was a valuable asset in a day when access to the AP wires was restricted to franchise-holders. This enabled them to buy the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press-Dispatch\". Bernard H. Ridder became publisher of the \"Pioneer Press-Dispatch\", turning the JoC presidency over to Joseph E. Ridder.\n\nIn the postwar years, the \"JoC\" also earned a reputation as a prime source of international trade news. In 1973 the paper scooped the world on perhaps the most significant economic development of the last 30 years. Six days ahead of any other newspaper, the JoC reported that Arab nations were going to embargo oil shipments to the U.S.\n\nOn Saturday, October 20, 1973, as the Yom Kippur War raged, the world learned that Arab nations would be suspending the supply of oil to the United States. The Journal of Commerce had the story of the notorious Arab oil embargo more than a week earlier. \"It was a story that impacted the entire world\", said Harold Gold, who was editor of the JoC at the time. Few thought the Arab nations would use oil as a weapon against the U.S. in response to its military support for Israel, which included a $2.2 billion military aid package. There had been threats, and an attempted embargo in 1967 that failed, so most dismissed the idea that it would ever happen.\n\nIn the later part of the 20th century, the \"JoC\" intensified its coverage of shipping, earning its nickname as the Bible of the maritime industry. Shipping was transformed forever by the introduction by Malcom McLean in 1956 of the container ship. Containerized shipping made traditional breakbulk ports obsolete and provided the means for Asia's export boom, which changed the world's economic map. The JoC reported in detail on these and other developments in transportation and logistics.\n\nThe JoC never missed a day of publication, even on the day in February 1993, when terrorists detonated a bomb in the garage under the World Trade Center, killing six people. The paper's New York staff managed to find its way down the darkened, smoke-filled fire-escape stairs of the tower to safety below. The staff at the Phillipsburg, New Jersey printing plant put the paper out that day.\n\nThe shipping industry, which had flourished through the 1960s and 1970s, began a period of consolidation in the mid-1990s because of plunging freight rates. Separate shipping companies that had run multiple ads in the paper merged and eliminated competing routes. With the rapid growth of the Internet in the 1990s, many shipping companies began to switch their ship schedules onto their Web sites, where shippers around the world could access them.\n\nKnight-Ridder decided to get out of business information altogether to focus on its daily metropolitan newspapers. In 1995, it sold the \"JoC\" to The Economist Group of London, publishers of the widely respected, \"The Economist\". Under The Economist Group the JoC tightened its focus to cover international trade logistics. In 1999, the broadsheet newspaper was converted to a tabloid newspaper format.\n\nIt became increasingly apparent that a print newspaper with a worldwide readership faced a struggle in keeping its readers up-to-date on breaking news. By the time the newspaper was delivered, most readers had already gotten their news by fax, telephone or on the Internet. In 2000, the \"JoC\" converted the its daily print publication into a weekly magazine, \"JoC Week\", which provided analysis of trade logistics.\n\nIn 2001, \"The Economist\" sold the JoC to Commonwealth Business Media, the New Jersey-based publisher of \"Pacific Shipper\", \"Canadian Sailings\", and a number of railroad and trucking directories. The new owners had long-standing connections with the transportation industry, having previously owned \"Traffic World\", another magazine acquired with its purchase of the JoC Group.\n\nIn 2006, United Business Media acquired Commonwealth Business Media, from its owners: RFE Investment Partners, Bariston Partners, The Economist Group, ABRY Partners and Commonwealth's management. In 2008, United Business Media reorganized Commonwealth Business Media into two separate market-focused businesses. \"The Journal of Commerce\" became a part of the UBM Global Trade group, focusing on serving professional communities engaged in commercial sea, rail and road transportation and logistics worldwide.\n\nEffective March 2, 2009, \"Traffic World\" magazine and \"The Journal of Commerce\" merged into one publication under the flagship \"Journal of Commerce\" banner. The JoC introduced a redesigned, comprehensive editorial product that utilizes data from to enhance news stories, offer a variety of Web tools that will complement its move to a digital environment with real-time focus, provide more analysis and market-oriented content.\n\nThe combined publication integrates the trucking, rail transport, express and domestic-focused logistics coverage of \"Traffic World\" with the international, U.S. Customs, container shipping, intermodal and breakbulk focus of \"The Journal of Commerce\" titles. The new publication is led by Paul Page, Editorial Director, and Joe Bonney, Executive Editor.\n\nUBM sold the majority of its data business to Electra Partners in 2013, who formed AXIO Data Group. IHS Inc. announced in November 2014 that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire JOC Group Inc.\n\n"}
{"id": "37254146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37254146", "title": "Torbjörn Evrell", "text": "Torbjörn Evrell\n\nRune Torbjörn Evrell (March 29, 1920 – April 22, 2008) was a Swedish inventor and businessman who made major innovations in folding knife construction, knife designs and knife production methods at EKA-knivar AB Eskilstuna, Sweden.\n\nBorn 1920 in Stockholm, Lidingö. Between 11 and 12 years of age he lived in Muncie Indiana, USA. His father, Kaleb Evrell, developed a patent for an automatic transmission for passenger cars for Warner Gears. After the US experience the family moved to Eskilstuna.\n\nTorbjörn Evrell received his degree mechanical engineering in 1945 from the Royal Institute of Technology. His first job was at Centrala Torpedverkstaden, CTV (Torpedo factory of the Swedish Defence Industries) in Motala.\n\nIn 1946 Torbjörn Evrell took management of Eskilstuna Knivfabriks AB (EKA) knife making company when the owner John Elmquist (Evrells father in law) unexpectedly died. Evrell, specialist in submersible motors and pumps, now became President of EKA at the age of 26. He took over a company, which in many respects was using production methods of the late 1800s, with a rather outdated machinery with many processes with belt drive from hydropower. Evrell started modernisation . Production technology was improved and the old knife range cut down and new modern knives had to be developed. Evrell first task was to clean up the knife range. He took out a full sales statistics and noted that many models were marginal to sales or outdated. He considered that he could immediately reduce the number of models from 91 to 37. Moreover, he introduced standard components which could be used in several knives.\n\nEvrell also introduced a new systematic production planning, improved methods and machinery were upgraded. Everything to make better knives cheaper. Evrell started using subcontractors and concentrated construction and production to knives.\n\nHe was throughout his career continuously involved in all areas of the company including knife innovation, production and marketing. There are a number of influential knife patents in his name. Out of the one time many dozens of knife making companies of Eskilstuna, his was the only one to survive by constant innovation and adaptions to new conditions.\n\nEvrell was the president of EKA until 1985, when he was succeeded by his daughter Karin Ingelson. Torbjörn Evrell continued as an advisor to EKA, especially in product development, for ten more years.\n\nPrior to 1970, all knives were riveted. Riveting was done by hand, and all work with assembly and adjustment, requires craftsmanship which is very labor-intensive. It took at least three to four years for a workman to reach the skill and speed required in production. Evrell realized the problems and wanted to find a faster and less labor-intensive method, while at the same time make the world's best folding knife with one blade. An effort started in November 1967 to come up with a new construction to hold a knife together. The final version of the knife was improved by two external consultants to the company: Olle Nordlund and the industrial designer Sigvard Bernadotte . The results were presented in March 1970 when Evrell could launch the first bolted folding knife in the \"Swede series\". The first two models were named Swede 38 (design Sigvard Bernadotte) and Swede 45. The special features of the Swede knives is that the scales are screwed in place. The knife scales can easily be removed, with a screwdriver or coin, for cleaning and lubrication of the blade and inside. The screws are also used to adjust the blade folding mechanism. This new way to manufacture folding knives was completely revolutionary and came to mean a big international breakthrough for EKA. The Swede series started with the EKA Swede 38 knife with plastic scales (offered in several colors) and brass screws with a blade in either carbon steel or stainless steel. The Swede 45 had wooden scales. These first models have been followed by several models with incremental developments.\n\nAnother of Evrells inventions is a small folding knife where the whole knife including the folding mechanism is welded together.\n\nWith increasing demand EKA-knivar continually made improvements to production methods. The production capacity was increased significantly. In 1971 the company with factory and office in central Eskilstuna was moved to newly built premises at Sättargatan 4 in Vilsta industrial area.\n\nTorbjörn Evrell was very aware of the value of marketing a knife. In 1967 he established a dedicated marketing department within his company, which was of great importance to the company's continued expansion. He also took advantage of the marketing value in a knife. All knife models have been available for branding and adaptation as promotional gifts to mark a sign of quality.\n\n"}
{"id": "13768829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13768829", "title": "Visy Industries", "text": "Visy Industries\n\nVisy Industries was established in Melbourne, Australia in 1948 and has since grown to become one of the world's largest privately owned paper, packaging and recycling companies. Today, Visy employs more than 9500 people in Australia and the United States (where it is known as Pratt Industries USA), with total sales exceeding more than $5 billion. Visy was owned by Richard Pratt until his death on 28 April 2009. when his son Anthony Pratt assumed the role of Executive Chairman. He has also presided over a major expansion into the Asian packaging market and moved to position Visy as a key player in food security for the region.\n\nToday, Visy's operational footprint extends from Sydney to Singapore, from Shanghai to San Francisco, with more than 180 facilities worldwide.\n\nVisy Industries began in 1948 with a 1000-pound loan from Richard Pratt's aunt, Ida Visbord, for whom the company is named. Originally, there were three partners – Visbord's husband Max Plotka, Richard Pratt's father Leon and engineer Les Feldman. From the day Visy opened for business in a Fitzroy, Melbourne factory there were indications this would be a company devoted to recycling and sustainability – the first corrugator it used was made from spare parts and recycled scrap metal.\n\nAfter Leon Pratt's death in 1969, his son Richard Pratt took over the reins and oversaw a dramatic expansion. Throughout the 1970s, Visy established new plants in New South Wales and Queensland, and by the end of the decade was making more than 100,000 tonnes of boxes a year. In the late 1970s and early 80s, Visy continued to grow but this time its major expansion was spearheaded by the decision to build 100% recycled paper mills, the first at Warwick Farm, Sydney. This decision not only signaled a shift in Visy's corporate philosophy but placed the company at the forefront of the recycling movement in Australia, setting the company on the path to record growth and profits. By 1990, Visy's national market share was over 40% with more than 2000 employees.\n\nRichard and Anthony Pratt then set their sights on the huge American market, with the younger Pratt moving to the U.S. to oversee the start-up and development of Pratt Industries USA. Through a combination of acquisition and greenfielding 100% recycled paper mills and state-of-the-art corrugators, Pratt Industries USA showed remarkable progress in the ensuing two decades, growing from the 46th largest corrugated packaging producer in America to the 5th. Today, Pratt Industries USA employs more than 4000 people, more Americans than any other Australian company. It is the only major paper company in the US that is 100% recycled.\n\nIn 2001, Visy undertook the-then largest development in its history, the construction of a $450 million kraft paper mill in Tumut, New South Wales. This was the first kraft mill built in the world in 20 years.\nIt was the biggest investment in regional Australia since the Snowy Mountains Scheme (RP Speech), and was hailed by Australia's leading environmentalists for its commitment to sustainability. It also boasts an advanced water usage system, with near-zero levels of effluent leaving the site. In fact, the Tumut mill is the most water efficient in the world - requiring just five tonnes of water to produce every tonne of product, compared to the global average of 25 tonnes. And it uses only forest thinnings and off-cuts for fibre.\n\nThe project was so successful that 10 years later Visy built Stage 2 on the same site – a second kraft paper mill bringing the total investment to Tumut to almost $1 billion. Stage 2, which was opened by NSW Premier Barry O’Farrell, was also hailed by environmentalists, and was a winner of the Australian Business Awards for “Environmental Sustainabilty.\"\n\nVisy continued to grow by acquisition as well as green-fielding. In 2001, the company effectively doubled in size when it acquired Southcorp Packaging. Visy was now operating at over 100 packaging and recycling sites in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. Moreover, Visy expanded its product mix to include steel and aluminum cans, PET bottles, beverage cartons and plastic packaging. It also continued to be a world leader in recycling and during this period Visy opened Australia's largest Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) in Smithfield, NSW.\n\nThe Pratt Foundation was established by Richard and Jeanne Pratt in 1978 to support various charitable causes and initiatives throughout Australia. Since then, it has donated more than $250 million. In addition, Jeanne and Richard Pratt helped raised a further $250 million by opening their home, Raheen, to other charitable fundraisers.\nThe Foundation is chaired by Anthony Pratt's sister, Heloise Waislitz. Its chief executive is Sam Lipski, a Melbourne-based journalist, and supports areas including medical research, education, the arts and relief of poverty.\n\nThe Pratt family is also behind VisyCares, a non-profit begun in 1995 which promotes social responsibility at Visy through donations to establish community-based projects such as youth, immigrant and learning centres.\n\nIn December 2005 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) commenced prosecution against Visy for alleged involvement in a cartel in the packaging industry. In 2007, Richard Pratt and the Visy group received a A$36 million fine for price fixing, representing the largest fine in Australian history at the time. That same year it was also learned that Visy was also one of a number of Australian companies that had used a trucking company later proved to be run by a former Hell's Angel.\n\nIn 2009, upon Anthony Pratt's ascendency to Executive Chairman, Visy appointed former ACCC Chairman Professor Allan Fels to chair its Governance Committee.\n\nIn addition, Pratt also announced former advisor to President Obama and the outgoing US Ambassador to Australia Jeffrey Bleich would join his company's advisory board. Bleich, an ex-clerk for former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, was a one-time special counsel to the President before being appointed Ambassador. He joins other advisory board members including Sir Dryden Spring, the former chairman of the Australian New Zealand National Bank, Allan Moss (AO), the former CEO of the Macquarie banking group and Jeanne Pratt (AC).\n\nIn 2016 the Australian Taxation Office revealed that in 2013-14, despite earning more than $2.5 billion in revenue, the holding company Pratt Consolidated Holdings had paid no tax. Further, that Thorney Investments, operated by Richard Pratt's son-in-law Alex Waislitz, which earned $430 million in revenue, had also paid no tax.\n\nVisy Industries has links with the outlaw motorcycle group, the Hells Angels. Visy Industries employs a trucking company run by Stephen James Rogers, a convicted drug trafficker and founding chapter boss of the Hells Angels. Rogers was sentenced in 2007 to three years' prison for drug trafficking, and a senior Visy Industries manager gave character evidence for Rogers at his trial and stated the company would stand by him despite his conviction for trafficking amphetamines. In 2012 Visy Industries was accused of using the Hells Angels to collect their debts. Police and industry sources state Visy founder Richard Pratt, who died in 2009, personally approved the deal with the Hells Angles. Visy Industries have called the accusations \"nonsense\".\n\nFollowing Richard Pratt's death in April, 2009, Anthony Pratt returned to Australia to assume the added responsibility of Global Executive Chairman of Visy Industries. This was in addition to him continuing in his long-time position as Chairman of Pratt Industries USA. Just two years after he assumed leadership of the company, Visy jumped from 43rd to 3rd in the AMR Corporate Citizenship Index, part of an annual survey of more than 60,000 Australians.\nUnder Anthony Pratt's leadership the company has also expanded its Asian presence and participation. Earnings from its Asian operations have increased by $100 million a year. This was achieved in several ways. Firstly, Visy established Build Run Repair, an engineering services company headquartered in Singapore to design and build sustainable pulp and paper mills and clean energy plants, leveraging the company's experience gained from building its own 15 paper mills and 4 clean energy plants.\nIts internal team of more than 40 engineers is also charged with maintaining Visy's worldwide portfolio of factories as well as source equipment and products from China, Vietnam, Malaysia other Asian countries. In addition, the Singapore operation houses a trading company. Its mission is to buy hundreds of millions of dollar worth of goods and services for both Visy and external customers. This period has also seen the growth of Visy's Thailand operations, which produce plastic products. The Thailand success builds on Visy's strategy of following its multinational customers into Asia.\n\nVisy has also set up warehouse distribution centres outside Shanghai and Beijing, as well as a trading office in Shenzhen which is selling Visy paper into the Chinese market. Visy's growing focus on Asian markets received a major boost in 2013 when Anthony Pratt announced plans to double the company's earnings in the region by building new packaging plants in at least four South-East Asian countries. They will be modeled on the group's existing plastics plants in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia.\n\nWork on the $260 million project is scheduled to begin in March, and will take 16 months. The 360,000-ton capacity plant will be built on a 50-acre site adjacent to Pratt's box-making plant in Valparaiso, Indiana, the world's largest. The new mill is expected to propel Pratt's USA sales to $2 billion.This follows other mills Pratt built in the US, most notably in New York City. That facility represents the largest manufacturing investment in the city since World War 2. And it is the only paper mill ever built in New York. New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg designated September 17, 2013, as “Pratt Industries Day” in the Big Apple, in tribute to the company's commitment to recycling and the environment. In a video posted on YouTube, entitled “NYC Mayor Salutes Pratt Industries,” Bloomberg cited a proclamation honoring Pratt's mill for having recycled 5 million tons of discarded paper since start-up in 1997.\n\nPratt also wants to ramp up Visy's logistics operations to help spearhead a four-fold increase in Australia's food exports to Asia, especially China. Visy is already the largest exporter of shipping containers from Australian ports at approximately 60,000 per year. Since his return to Australia, Pratt has taken a strong interest in sustainable agriculture and food security. More than 70 percent of Visy's customers are in the food and beverage industries.\n\nIn April 2013, Pratt gave the keynote address at the Global Food Forum, a major international conference on food security he organized in partnership with The Australian newspaper. Pratt said it was possible for Australia to sustainably quadruple its current food production through greater support for farmers and food companies and eventually feed 200 million people. The conference attracted leading political, agribusiness, food industry and academic figures.\n\nIn September 2013, Pratt was elected an executive member of the Australia-Japan Business Cooperation Committee, a group dedicated for more than 50 years to strengthening ties between the two countries. It includes some of the most prominent business leaders in Australia, and is chaired by former British Airways CEO and current News Corporation director Sir Rod Eddington (AO). In October, Pratt's growing business interests in Asia prompted Australia's new Prime Minister Tony Abbott to invite him on an official visit to Indonesia – the first overseas’ trip by the incoming leader.\n\nPratt has organised the build of a $50 million, 100% recycled plastics plant in Sydney. This plant will enable Visy to make its PET and HDPE bottles out of 100% recycled plastic resin for everything from soft drink bottles to shampoo bottles to milk bottles. At full capacity, this facility will remove some 2 billion plastic bottles from the waste stream and recycle them into new bottles.\n\nVisy-Pratt Industries USA have continued to build clean energy plants which now include facilities in Tumut, Atlanta, Ga., Melbourne and Queensland. These not only provide coal-free energy – thus reducing the company's carbon footprint – but they allow Visy to expand its recycling capabilities to beyond converting paper and plastics into 100% recycled products. It will also enable the company to convert almost all remaining garbage into clean energy, thus helping close down landfills.\n\nVisy has won awards including the 2011 Australian Packaging Design Awards where it was named Overall Show Winner at the Packaging Council of Australia annual awards.\n\nIn 2013, Visy and the Banksia Foundation – a leading Australian non-profit which promotes environmental excellence - teamed up to inaugurate the Richard Pratt-Banksia CEO Award. The award recognizes an individual executive's contributions towards the economic, social and environmental sustainability achievements of the organisation or company he/she leads. The award was named in honour of Pratt, who was seen as one of Australia's leading agents of change in the environmental sector. The 2013 winner was Ravi Naidu, CEO of the Cooperative Research Centre for Contamination Assessment and Remediation of the Environment. Naidu is a national leader in his field.\n\nVisy was also the 2004 Banksia Environmental Gold Award winner.\n"}

At , he played center and was known for his passing skills. He was among the first group of European basketball players to transfer to the NBA in the late 1980s and was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors. He is one of seven players in NBA history to record 13,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 3,000 assists and 1,500 blocked shots, along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett, Pau Gasol, and Hakeem Olajuwon. Divac was also the first player born and trained outside the United States to play in over 1,000 games in the NBA. On August 20, 2010, he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame in recognition of his play in international competition.\n\nAside from being noticed for his basketball abilities, Divac is also known as a humanitarian, helping children in his native country of Serbia, and in Africa. In October 2008, he was appointed as government adviser in Serbia for humanitarian issues. In February 2009, he was elected President of the Serbian Olympic Committee for a 4-year term and re-elected in November 2012. In 2013, Divac received an honor from the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame.\n\nDivac began playing basketball in his home town Prijepolje for the team KK Elan. He began his professional career in Yugoslavia playing for Sloga from Kraljevo, and was immediately noted for scoring 27 points against Crvena zvezda.\n\nIn the summer of 1986, Divac was the top star of the basketball transfer season, and he ended up signing with Partizan for DM14,000.\n\nIn the 1986–87 Yugoslav First League season, with players like Divac, Aleksandar Đorđević, Žarko Paspalj, Željko Obradović, and with coach Duško Vujošević at the helm, Partizan had a \"dream team\", which won the Yugoslavian League title. In the subsequent 1987–88 FIBA European Champions Cup season (now called EuroLeague), the club failed to reach the top of the EuroLeague, after having lost to Maccabi Tel Aviv in the semifinal in Ghent. Jugoplastika, with Dino Rađa and Toni Kukoč, was a stronger team in the subsequent three years, reigning both in Yugoslavia and in Europe.\n\nDivac had an unusual style compared to most other centers of his generation: despite his height, he possessed good mobility, had good control of the ball, and was a decent shooter. On occasion, he would also act as a play maker. His trademark moves included a mid-range shot at the top of the key and flip shots around the rim, while facing the complete opposite direction. His quirky moves complemented how he liked playing gags on the court: in the 1989 EuroBasket, he lifted teammate Zoran Radović for a slam dunk. In just four professional seasons in Europe, he became the most sought-after big man on the continent, after Arvydas Sabonis.\n\nDrafted into the NBA in 1989 by the Los Angeles Lakers, Divac became one of the first European players to have an impact in the league. Under the mentorship of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, he improved his play and adapted to the American style of basketball. Though he spoke no English, he quickly became popular among his teammates and the public for his charm and joviality. In the 1989–90 season, he was selected into the NBA All-Rookie Team.\n\nDivac earned a reputation for flopping, or deceiving the officials into calling a foul on the other team by purposely falling to the floor upon contact with an opposing player. Veteran NBA forward P. J. Brown claimed that Divac might have been the best of all time at flopping. Divac freely admitted doing so, adding that he usually did it when he felt like the officials had missed some calls and owed him. However, when the NBA instituted anti-flopping penalties in 2012, Divac expressed his support for such rules, stating that he felt players after him were \"overdo[ing] it\" with respect to flopping. Ian Thomsen, a \"Sports Illustrated\" columnist, grouped Divac with fellow international players Anderson Varejão and Manu Ginóbili as the players who \"made [flopping] famous\", exaggerating contact on the court in a manner analogous to diving in FIFA games.\n\nOn July 1, 1996, Divac was traded to the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and played two seasons there until signing with the Sacramento Kings in July 1998.\n\nDuring the 1998–99 NBA lockout, in January 1999, Divac played 2 games for Partizan's eternal rival KK Crvena Zvezda, in the 1998–99 EuroLeague season.\n\nHis debut for the \"crveno-beli\" took place mid-season, on Orthodox Christmas, versus a heavily favoured Žalgiris side led by Tyus Edney, Mindaugas Žukauskas, Saulius Štombergas, and Jiří Zídek Jr.. Supported by a raucous home crowd and energized by Divac's arrival, as well as his 16 points and 8 rebounds, Crvena zvezda pulled off a 77-69 memorable upset win.\n\nDivac's brief stint with Crvena zvezda, for which he reportedly got paid US$250,000 per game, immediately became a sore point with KK Partizan fans, who unfurled a banner calling him a traitor, at their club's next game.\n\nThe issue of playing for the hated cross-town rival reignited several years later, when Divac returned to KK Partizan as club president. At the time, he stated his decision to play for Crvena zvezda was \"a mistake\".\n\nHe then signed as a free agent with the Sacramento Kings where he played for six seasons alongside fellow countryman Peja Stojaković. Teamed with Stojaković, Hedo Türkoğlu, Chris Webber and Mike Bibby; Divac revitalized the Sacramento Kings franchise. The Kings rose in the NBA ranks, becoming a perennial playoff contender and eventually a championship contender, leading the league in wins in 2001–02. The Kings, however, could not get past the Los Angeles Lakers, who beat them in a 7-game series in 2002. \n\nAfter the 2003–04 NBA season, Divac became a free agent. He signed a deal to return to the Lakers, part of Mitch Kupchak's plan to overhaul Laker basketball. The Lakers, following a defeat in the NBA Finals, had traded away or released most of their players, including Shaquille O'Neal, Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Derek Fisher, and more; Divac was supposed to help fill that void.\n\nHowever, Divac suffered back problems and could not play most of the season, and even when he returned, could only play about nine minutes per game, averaging 2.3 points per game and 2.1 rebounds per game in 15 games, he played 8 games early in the season and 7 more in the final month of the season.\n\nOn 14 July 2005, 37-year-old Divac announced his retirement, ending his sixteen-year NBA and twenty-two-year professional basketball career. Divac accepted a position with the Lakers as a European liaison to help with scouting overseas.\n\nThe Kings retired his No. 21 jersey in a ceremony on March 31, 2009. Over his 16 years in the NBA, Divac earned over $93,000,000 in salary. In September 2009, he played for the \"NBA Generations\" team in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge, a series of exhibitions against Korean Basketball League and Philippine Basketball Association players.\n\nIn summer 1986, at 18, right after signing for KK Partizan, Divac debuted for the senior Yugoslavia national basketball team at the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Madrid, on invitation by the head coach Krešimir Ćosić. However, the excellent rookie's performance was spoiled by the event in the semi-finals against the Soviet Union. Forty-five seconds before the end, Yugoslavia had a comfortable lead of 9 points, but the Soviets scored two three-pointers within a few seconds and cut the difference to 3 points. Yugoslavia tried to hold the ball for the remaining time, opting to continue the play with throw-ins instead of free throws following fouls, but with only 14 seconds left, Divac committed a double dribble, the Soviets were awarded the ball, and tied the score with another three-pointer. In the overtime, the Soviets easily prevailed against the shocked Yugoslavs, who had to be content with the bronze.\n\nThe next year, Divac participated in the team that took the gold at the FIBA Junior World Championship (since split into separate under-19 and under-21 events) in Bormio, Italy. That event launched the young generation of Yugoslavian basket ballers, also featuring stars like Rađa and Kukoč, regarded as likely the best in history. Before the breakup of Yugoslavia, they would also take the titles at EuroBasket 1989 and the 1990 FIBA World Championship in Argentina, where they were led by Dražen Petrović, as well as the EuroBasket 1991 title, with Aleksandar Đorđević at point guard.\nWhen Yugoslavia won the gold in the 1990 FIBA World Championship, fans rushed onto the court. One of them was holding a Croatian flag, one of the six republics that made up Yugoslavia. Divac claims that he told the man that he should not be waving that flag, since this was a win for Yugoslavia. Divac claims the man made a derogatory remark about the Yugoslav flag, at which point Divac took his flag from him. This happened during a very tense time where nationalistic pride was threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart and ignite a war. The taking of the flag made Divac a hero to Serbs, and a villain to Croatians. Divac has stated that he did not mean it as an act against Croatia and he would have taken away a Serbian flag if a Serb fan had done the same.\n\nThis action, along with the Yugoslav Wars, alienated Divac from many of his former Croatian friends, particularly Dražen Petrović, whom he considered his best friend. When Yugoslavia won EuroBasket 1995, and Croatia won bronze, Croatia, still at war with Serbs from Croatia, walked off the podium during the medal ceremony. The teams had not faced each other in the tournament.\n\n\n\n\nThrough the twilight of his playing career and afterwards, Divac focused on three fields: humanitarian work, sport management, and investment.\n\nIn late 2000, following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević whose policies Divac had been openly critical of throughout mid-to-late 1990s, Divac and former teammate Predrag Danilović took over their former club KK Partizan. They did so on initiative by Ivica Dačić, the club's outgoing president and, more importantly, a suddenly marginalized politician who, due to his association with Milošević, was forced to leave his post at the club. Seeing that various state-owned companies and community property were being taken over in a dubious manner during the power vacuum that resulted from régime change, Dačić saw it prudent to bring the club's two former greats as a safeguard against the same happening to KK Partizan. Divac became the club's president while Danilović took the vice-president role.\n\nFreshly retired from playing, Danilović was actually running the club's day-to-day operations since Divac was still very actively involved with the Sacramento Kings at the time. The head coach they inherited, Darko Russo, finished out the 2000–01 season before they decided in summer 2001 to bring back their mentor Duško Vujošević to be the new head coach.\n\nThough the duo never stated so outright, their additional motivation in getting involved with KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the Serbian parliament. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, at least until the law appears. Divac and Danilović appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continued to be involved with it in a lesser capacity for a few years afterwards.\n\nIn October 2005, right after ending his playing career with the Los Angeles Lakers, Divac got hired as the Lakers' European scout, reporting directly to the team's general manager Mitch Kupchak. He left the position in 2006.\n\nIn June 2006, through his friendship with Predrag Mijatović, Divac linked up with Ramón Calderón as part of the lawyer's candidate bid for the presidency of Real Madrid polideportivo. When Calderón closely won the club elections on 2 July 2006, Divac was announced as the head of operations at Real Madrid basketball club though the scope of his job description soon got reduced to consulting duties as president Calderón's adviser for basketball and club's international coordinator.\n\nHowever, Divac's role in the club's day-to-day operations turned out to be largely symbolic, and he even admitted as much in a March 2007 interview for Croatian weekly \"Globus\": \"I literally do nothing and I only serve as part of the \"royal club\"'s image. I only accepted the job because of Mijatović, who is currently the football director at Real\". By the end of 2007, following a financial settlement between the two parties, Divac moved on from the post for which he had been reportedly receiving an annual compensation of €300,000.\n\nIn October 2008, Divac's political advisory engagement within the Serbian government as the sports, diaspora, and humanitarian advisor to the Deputy Prime Minister and Internal Affairs Minister Ivica Dačić, got announced.\n\nDivac was proposed in 2000 as Yugoslavia's candidate for the Sport Commission of the International Olympic Committee in spring 2000. This candidature was withdrawn under pressure from Milošević regime. In February 2009, Divac ran for presidency of the Olympic Committee of Serbia against incumbent president Ivan Ćurković. He won the race after Ćurković withdrew just before the scheduled voting. In November 2012, he was re-elected as the sole candidate; the end of his second mandate coincides with the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn December 2014, Kosovo was accepted as a full member of the International Olympic Committee. Divac and the Serbian Olympic Committee have been criticised, chiefly by the Democratic Party of Serbia, for failing to take any effort to prevent that. Divac stated that he is not happy with the decision of the IOC, but could not have prevented it as it had already been made, and said he would accept it \"in the interest of the athletes\".\n\nOn May 9, 2017, he was succeeded by Serbian former basketball coach Božidar Maljković on position of the president of Olympic Committee of Serbia.\n\nIn early March 2015, Divac was hired by the Sacramento Kings as their vice president of basketball and franchise operations. Brought into the organization by the principal owner Vivek Ranadivé towards the end of a turbulent season, Divac's arrival came in the wake of head coach Mike Malone's firing and the eventual hiring of George Karl. Working alongside the team's general manager Pete D'Alessandro, Divac's initial duties with the Kings were reported to be advising the front office and coaches as well as assisting with branding and fan outreach. However, such broadly defined job responsibilities immediately led to press speculation about Divac's role within the organization that in addition to general manager D'Alessandro also featured assistant GM Mike Bratz, special assistant to the GM Mitch Richmond, director of player personnel and analytics Dean Oliver, adviser to the chairman Chris Mullin, as well as a head coach, Karl, who has always wanted to be involved in personnel issues. Within a month of Divac's hiring, ESPN's Marc Stein reported that \"despite the Kings not yet announcing their new power structure, Divac is indeed already regarded as the team's top basketball official by owner Ranadivé\".\n\nOn 10 June 2015, two weeks before the NBA draft, general manager D'Alessandro left the Kings by accepting a front-office position with the Denver Nuggets amid reports he did so due to being stripped of his decision-making power after Ranadivé hired Divac.\n\nOnly days before the draft, animosity between head coach Karl and the team's star center DeMarcus Cousins reignited, as Karl reportedly lobbied Divac, as well as multiple players on the Kings' roster, in order to make the case to owner Ranadive that Cousins needs to be traded. As a result, against the backdrop of Cousins calling Karl a \"snake\" on Twitter, Divac reportedly discussed multiple Cousins trade scenarios with various teams, but ultimately no deal got made. At the 2015 NBA draft, with the 6th pick, the Kings selected 21-year-old center Willie Cauley-Stein out of Kentucky. Less than a week following the draft, with the dissolution of the Karl—Cousins relationship on public display, the Kings' ultimately unsuccessful attempt at landing University of Kentucky head coach John Calipari to replace Karl got reported.\n\nThen in early July 2015, in an effort of clearing salary cap space in order to immediately go after free agents, they agreed a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers, sending Nick Stauskas, Carl Landry, Jason Thompson along with the Kings' future first round draft pick to the Sixers as well as the rights to swap first round picks in 2016 and 2017 while receiving the rights to Sixers oversees players Artūras Gudaitis and Luka Mitrović in return. Two days later, they agreed the acquisitions of two free agents: twenty-nine-year-old Marco Belinelli on a three-year US$19 million contract and twenty-nine-year-old point guard Rajon Rondo for one year for US$10 million. This was followed by signing twenty-six-year-old center Kosta Koufos for four years and US$33 million with his role envisioned as backup for Cousins.\n\nWith the free agent signings done, Divac turned his attention to attempting to mend the relations between the team's head coach Karl and its star center Cousins ahead of the 2015-16 season, admitting publicly on 9 July 2015 on CBS Sports Radio's \"The Jim Rome Show\" that the relationship between the two \"isn't pretty right now\". A few days later, on 13 July 2015, during a 2015 NBA Summer League game in Las Vegas, the two shared an awkward on-camera handshake as Karl approached and Cousins reluctantly shook the coach's hand before turning away. Later that week, Divac summoned Cousins and Karl to a private counseling session.\n\nDivac was promoted to the Kings' vice president of basketball operations and general manager on 31 August 2015.\n\nAmid a tense and incident-filled season that saw the team briefly reach the final playoff spot in the Western Conference before unravelling with extended losing streaks in late January and early February 2016, the organization reportedly made a decision to fire their head coach George Karl during the upcoming All-Star break, a move pushed for by Divac. However, in a quick about-face, Karl got retained after meeting with Divac and reportedly pledging to make changes to address concerns within the organization about his defensive schemes and practice policies. It was later reported that the move to fire Karl on this occasion got scuttled by the Kings minority owners over financial concerns. Month and a half later, in late March 2016, Divac signed a multi-year contract extension with the organization. The team finished the season 33–49, eight games out of the playoffs, good for 10th spot in the Western Conference. Their final season in Sleep Train Arena, the team's home since 1988, it was also their first 30 plus win campaign after seven consecutive seasons of fewer than 30 wins.\n\nEarly into the team's off-season, in mid April 2016, the Kings organization fired head coach George Karl, a decision made by Divac who had reportedly been pushing for it for months. Within three weeks, during which Divac interviewed head coaching candidates Sam Mitchell, Vinny Del Negro, Mike Woodson, David Blatt, Mark Jackson, Jeff Hornacek, Nate McMillan, Patrick Ewing, Elston Turner, and Corliss Williamson, the Kings hired Dave Joerger as their new head coach, signing him to a four-year deal worth US$16 million. At the 2016 NBA draft, with the 8th pick, the Kings selected Marquese Chriss out of the University of Washington, but traded him to the Phoenix Suns for rights to Bogdan Bogdanović as well as the Suns' 2016 draft 13th and 28th picks, Georgios Papagiannis and Skal Labissière, respectively.\n\nAt the 2017 NBA draft, with the 5th pick, the Kings selected point guard De'Aaron Fox out of Kentucky.\n\nDivac has been involved in many non-basketball endeavors while still actively playing in the NBA, and more so after he retired. He is an active restaurant investor in the Sacramento, California area. However, his attempts to make major investments in Serbia failed, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe most notable affair was a highly publicized business venture—takeover bid of profitable beverage producer Knjaz Miloš. Divac's company \"Apurna\", in a joint venture with French dairy giant Danone, ostensibly proposed the best bid, but the takeover was aborted by the Serbia's Securities Commission, because Danone/Apurna allegedly offered extra money to small shareholders.\nIn the repeated bid, Divac and Danone eventually withdrew and the sale went to FPP Balkan Ltd., a privatization fund from the Cayman Islands. The entire messy affair caused great friction within the Serbian government, wide speculation about corruption, resignation of the Securities Commission chief, and even a police investigation.\n\nAnother similar, though less spectacular, episode happened with 2005 Divac's attempt to take over the \"Večernje novosti\", a Serbian high-circulation daily. He made an agreement with small shareholders to take over the company by means of registering a new company with joint capital, which would increase the share capital. However, the Serbian Government intervened and halted what should have been a mere technical move. While the attempted takeover was a \"backdoor\" one indeed, it was legal and similar cases had already occurred. The government ostensibly feared lack of control over the influential daily. Even though the Supreme Court of Serbia eventually ruled in Divac's favor, he withdrew from the contest, citing \"friendly advice\" by unnamed persons. Embittered, he decided to stop his attempts to invest in Serbia: \"All of this is ugly and I'm very upset... I realized that there's no place for me in Serbia and my friends can meet me in Madrid from now on... In Serbia, some different rules are in effect, and I can't conceive them\".\n\nHowever, that turned out not to be true, as in October 2007 Divac got legally registered as 100% owner of Voda Voda, a bottled water brand previously owned by businessman Vojin Đorđević. That transaction was also followed by a stir of controversy, as Đorđević publicly accused Divac of deceit, asserting that he broke a gentlemen's agreement they had, and questioning the validity of the contract that Divac presented to the Serbian Business Registers Agency. The circumstances surrounding the deal (as of November 2007) are still unclear: Divac claims that he indeed loaned some money to the Đorđević's Si&Si company, which was in financial troubles, and after Đorđević failed to fulfill his part of the deal, just used the contract, already properly signed by Đorđević, to claim ownership of the company.\n\nDivac is a humanitarian worker, focusing on aid to children worldwide and refugees in his home country. Along with six Serbian basketball teammates, Divac established the charity called Group Seven, later renamed to \"Divac's Children Foundation\", and works closely with International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC), helping them to raise around US$500,000 for humanitarian assistance in Serbia since 1997. Divac's own foundation, presided by his wife Snežana, provided over $2,500,000 in humanitarian assistance through 1998–2007.\n\nIn late 2007 Divac founded a humanitarian organization, \"You Can Too\" (Serbian: \"Можеш и ти/Možeš i ti\"), bent on assisting the refugees in Serbia. Serbia has around 500,000 refugees from the 1990s Yugoslav wars, making it the country with the largest refugee problem in Europe. Around 7,800 of those people still live in collective centers under poor conditions, so the organization has vouched itself to buy abandoned countryside houses, in an attempt to finally solve their accommodation problem.\n\nFrom September 21 to 23, 2007, Divac organized an official farewell from active basketball career in his hometown Prijepolje and Belgrade, simultaneously promoting the \"You Can Too\" campaign. The spectacle culminated in gathering of Divac and his worldwide friends in front of 10,000 people outside the National Assembly building.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the song \"Vlade Divac\" by Belgrade band Deca Loših Muzičara, devoted to his transfer to Lakers, was a big hit; the band finally got to personally meet Divac and perform the song with him on his farewell party in 2007.\n\nDuring his time with the Lakers, Divac's popularity and marketing potential, in addition to his entertaining and good-natured personality, were picked up on by the American TV industry. As a result, he appeared quite a few times on Los Angeles-based late night programmes such as \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" and \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\". In 1990, he was featured in a commercial with Laker teammates A. C. Green and Mychal Thompson for the Schick brand razors company. He also appeared in American sitcoms \"Married... with Children\" and \"Coach\", as well as in the short lived \"Good Sports\" sitcom. On the big screen Divac took part in basketball-based movies \"Eddie\", \"Space Jam\" and \"Juwanna Mann\". Later in his career, he appeared on \"Larry King Live\" in 1999 and \"The Late Late Show\" in 2002.\n\nIn Serbia, all throughout his playing career, Divac regularly appeared in commercials pitching products ranging from Atlas Beer to Société Générale Bank mortgage credit plans. He appeared in a national TV commercial in the United States alongside former NBA star Darryl Dawkins for Taco Bell.\n\nDivac appeared as a special guest on Eurovision 2008. He threw a ball into the audience, which marked the beginning of televoting.\n\nDivac features in the ESPN \"30 for 30\" documentary \"Once Brothers\", where he discusses the exploits of the Yugoslavia national basketball team in the late 1980s and early 1990s and how the Yugoslav Wars tore them apart, especially in context of his broken friendship with Croatian player Dražen Petrović.\n\nDivac appears in Boris Malagurski's documentary film \"The Weight of Chains\", in which he talks about the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.\n\nDivac and his wife, Snežana, have two sons, Luka and Matija, and an adopted daughter, Petra, whose biological parents were killed by Kosovo Liberation Army snipers during the Kosovo War.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8877168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8877168", "title": "WikiLeaks", "text": "WikiLeaks\n\nWikiLeaks () is an international non-profit organisation that publishes secret information, news leaks, and classified media provided by anonymous sources. Its website, initiated in 2006 in Iceland by the organisation Sunshine Press, claims a database of 10 million documents in 10 years since its launch. Julian Assange, an Australian Internet activist, is generally described as its founder and director. Kristinn Hrafnsson is its editor-in-chief.\n\nThe group has released a number of prominent document dumps. Early releases included documentation of equipment expenditures and holdings in the Afghanistan war and a report informing a corruption investigation in Kenya. In April 2010, WikiLeaks released the so-called \"Collateral Murder\" footage from the 12 July 2007 Baghdad airstrike in which Iraqi journalists were among those killed. Other releases in 2010 included the Afghan War Diary and the \"Iraq War Logs\". The latter allowed the mapping of 109,032 deaths in \"significant\" attacks by insurgents in Iraq that had been reported to Multi-National Force – Iraq, including about 15,000 that had not been previously published. In 2010, WikiLeaks also released the US State Department diplomatic \"cables\", classified cables that had been sent to the US State Department. In April 2011, WikiLeaks began publishing 779 secret files relating to prisoners detained in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\nDuring the 2016 US presidential election campaign, WikiLeaks released emails and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta. These releases caused significant harm to the Clinton campaign, and have been attributed as a potential contributing factor to her loss. The U.S. intelligence community expressed \"high confidence\" that the leaked emails had been hacked by Russia and supplied to WikiLeaks, while WikiLeaks denied their source was Russia or any other state. During the campaign, WikiLeaks promoted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. In private conversations from November 2015 that were later leaked, Julian Assange expressed a preference for a GOP victory in the 2016 election, explaining that \"Dems+Media+liberals woudl [sic] then form a block to reign [sic] in their worst qualities. With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities, dems+media+neoliberals will be mute.\" In secret correspondence with the Trump campaign on election day (8 November 2016), WikiLeaks encouraged the Trump campaign to contest the election results in case they lost.\n\nWikiLeaks has drawn criticism for its absence of whistleblowing on or criticism of Russia, and for criticising the Panama Papers' exposé of businesses and individuals with offshore bank accounts. WikiLeaks has also been criticised for inadequately curating its content and violating the personal privacy of individuals. WikiLeaks has, for instance, revealed Social Security numbers, medical information, credit card numbers, details of suicide attempts, and other sensitive personal information.\n\nThe wikileaks.org domain name was registered on 4 October 2006. The website was established and published its first document in December 2006. WikiLeaks is usually represented in public by Julian Assange, who has been described as \"the heart and soul of this organisation, its founder, philosopher, spokesperson, original coder, organiser, financier, and all the rest\". Sarah Harrison, Kristinn Hrafnsson and Joseph Farrell are the only other publicly known and acknowledged associates of Assange who are currently living. Harrison is also a member of Sunshine Press Productions along with Assange and Ingi Ragnar Ingason. Gavin MacFadyen was acknowledged by Assange as a ″beloved director of WikiLeaks″ shortly after his death in 2016.\n\nWikiLeaks was originally established with a \"wiki\" communal publication method, which was terminated by May 2010. Original volunteers and founders were once described as a mixture of Asian dissidents, journalists, mathematicians, and start-up company technologists from the United States, Taiwan, Europe, Australia, and South Africa. , the website had more than 1,200 registered volunteers.\n\nDespite some popular confusion, related to the fact both sites use the \"wiki\" name and website design template, WikiLeaks and Wikipedia are not affiliated. Wikia, a for-profit corporation affiliated loosely with the Wikimedia Foundation, purchased several WikiLeaks-related domain names as a \"protective brand measure\" in 2007.\n\nOn 26 September 2018, Julian Assange stepped down as editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks.\n\nAccording to the WikiLeaks website, its goal is \"to bring important news and information to the public ... One of our most important activities is to publish original source material alongside our news stories so readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth.\" Another of the organisation's goals is to ensure that journalists and whistleblowers are not prosecuted for emailing sensitive or classified documents. The online \"drop box\" is described by the WikiLeaks website as \"an innovative, secure and anonymous way for sources to leak information to [WikiLeaks] journalists\".\n\nSome describe WikiLeaks as a media or journalistic organisation. For example, in a 2013 resolution, the International Federation of Journalists, a trade union of journalists, called WikiLeaks a \"new breed of media organisation\" that \"offers important opportunities for media organisations\". Harvard professor Yochai Benkler praised WikiLeaks as a new form of journalistic enterprise, testifying at the court-martial of Chelsea Manning (then Bradley Manning) that \"WikiLeaks did serve a particular journalistic function,\" and that the \"range of the journalist's privilege\" is \"a hard line to draw\". Others do not consider WikiLeaks to be journalistic in nature. Media ethicist Kelly McBride of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies wrote in 2011: \"WikiLeaks might grow into a journalist endeavor. But it's not there yet.\" Bill Keller of \"The New York Times\" considers WikiLeaks to be a \"complicated source\" rather than a journalistic partner. Prominent First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams writes that WikiLeaks is not a journalistic group, but instead \"an organization of political activists; ... a source for journalists; and ... a conduit of leaked information to the press and the public\". Noting Assange's statements that he and his colleagues read only a small fraction of information before deciding to publish it, Abrams writes: \"No journalistic entity I have ever heard of—none—simply releases to the world an elephantine amount of material it has not read.\"\n\nAccording to a January 2010 interview, the WikiLeaks team then consisted of five people working full-time and about 800 people who worked occasionally, none of whom were compensated. WikiLeaks does not have any official headquarters. In November 2010 the WikiLeaks-endorsed news and activism site WikiLeaks Central was initiated and was administrated by editor Heather Marsh who oversaw over 70 writers and volunteers. She resigned on 8 March 2012.\n\nWikiLeaks describes itself as \"an uncensorable system for untraceable mass document leaking\". The website is available on multiple servers, different domain names and has an official Darkweb version (available on the Tor Network) as a result of a number of denial-of-service attacks and its elimination from different Domain Name System (DNS) providers.\n\nUntil August 2010, WikiLeaks was hosted by PRQ, a Sweden-based company providing \"highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services\". PRQ is said to have \"almost no information about its clientele and maintains few if any of its own logs\". Currently, WikiLeaks is hosted mainly by the Swedish Internet service provider Bahnhof in the Pionen facility, a former nuclear bunker in Sweden. Other servers are spread around the world with the main server located in Sweden. Julian Assange has said that the servers are located in Sweden and the other countries \"specifically because those nations offer legal protection to the disclosures made on the site\". He talks about the Swedish constitution, which gives the information–providers total legal protection. It is forbidden, according to Swedish law, for any administrative authority to make inquiries about the sources of any type of newspaper. These laws, and the hosting by PRQ, make it difficult for any authority to eliminate WikiLeaks; they place an onus of proof upon any complainant whose suit would circumscribe WikiLeaks' liberty, e.g. its rights to exercise free speech online. Furthermore, \"WikiLeaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations, keeps no logs and uses military-grade encryption to protect sources and other confidential information.\" Such arrangements have been called \"bulletproof hosting\".\n\nAfter the site became the target of a denial-of-service attack on its old servers, WikiLeaks moved its website to Amazon's servers. Later, however, the website was \"ousted\" from the Amazon servers. In a public statement, Amazon said that WikiLeaks was not following its terms of service. The company further explained: \"There were several parts they were violating. For example, our terms of service state that 'you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content ... that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity.' It's clear that WikiLeaks doesn't own or otherwise control all the rights to this classified content.\" WikiLeaks was then moved to servers at OVH, a private web-hosting service in France. After criticism from the French government, the company sought two court rulings about the legality of hosting WikiLeaks. While the court in Lille immediately refused to force OVH to deactivate the WikiLeaks website, the court in Paris stated it would need more time to examine the complex technical issue.\n\nWikiLeaks used EveryDNS, but was dropped by the company after distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against WikiLeaks hurt the quality of service for its other customers. Supporters of WikiLeaks waged verbal and DDoS attacks on EveryDNS. Because of a typographical error in blogs mistaking EveryDNS for competitor \"EasyDNS\", the sizeable Internet backlash hit EasyDNS. Despite that, EasyDNS (upon request of a customer who was setting up new WikiLeaks hosting) began providing WikiLeaks with DNS service on \"two 'battle hardened' servers\" to protect the quality of service for its other customers.\n\nWikiLeaks restructured its process for contributions after its first document leaks did not gain much attention. Assange stated this was part of an attempt to take the voluntary effort typically seen in \"Wiki\" projects, and \"redirect it to ... material that has real potential for change\". Some sympathisers were unhappy when WikiLeaks ended a community-based wiki format in favour of a more centralised organisation. The \"about\" page originally read:\n\nHowever, WikiLeaks established an editorial policy that accepted only documents that were \"of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical interest\" (and excluded \"material that is already publicly available\"). This coincided with early criticism that having no editorial policy would drive out good material with spam and promote \"automated or indiscriminate publication of confidential records\". The original FAQ is no longer in effect, and no one can post or edit documents on WikiLeaks. Now, submissions to WikiLeaks are reviewed by anonymous WikiLeaks reviewers, and documents that do not meet the editorial criteria are rejected. By 2008, the revised FAQ stated: \"Anybody can post comments to it. [ ... ] Users can publicly discuss documents and analyse their credibility and veracity.\" After the 2010 reorganisation, posting new comments on leaks was no longer possible.\n\nThe legal status of WikiLeaks is complex. Assange considers WikiLeaks a protection intermediary. Rather than leaking directly to the press, and fearing exposure and retribution, whistleblowers can leak to WikiLeaks, which then leaks to the press for them. Its servers are located throughout Europe and are accessible from any uncensored web connection. The group located its headquarters in Sweden because it has one of the world's strongest laws to protect confidential source-journalist relationships. WikiLeaks has stated it does not solicit any information. However, Assange used his speech during the Hack in the Box conference in Malaysia to ask the crowd of hackers and security researchers to help find documents on its \"Most Wanted Leaks of 2009\" list.\n\nThe US Justice Department began a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange soon after the leak of diplomatic cables began. Attorney General Eric Holder affirmed the investigation was \"not saber-rattling\", but was \"an active, ongoing criminal investigation\". \"The Washington Post\" reported that the department was considering charges under the Espionage Act of 1917, an action which former prosecutors characterised as \"difficult\" because of First Amendment protections for the press. Several Supreme Court cases (e.g. \"Bartnicki v. Vopper\") have established previously that the American Constitution protects the re-publication of illegally gained information provided the publishers did not themselves violate any laws in acquiring it. Federal prosecutors have also considered prosecuting Assange for trafficking in stolen government property, but since the diplomatic cables are intellectual rather than physical property, that method is also difficult. Any prosecution of Assange would require extraditing him to the United States, a procedure made more complicated and potentially delayed by any preceding extradition to Sweden. One of Assange's lawyers, however, says they are fighting extradition to Sweden because it might result in his extradition to the United States. Assange's attorney, Mark Stephens, has \"heard from Swedish authorities there has been a secretly empanelled grand jury in Alexandria [Virginia]\" meeting to consider criminal charges for the WikiLeaks case.\n\nIn Australia, the government and the Australian Federal Police have not stated what Australian laws may have been violated by WikiLeaks, but then Prime Minister Julia Gillard has stated that the foundation of WikiLeaks and the stealing of classified documents from the United States administration is illegal in foreign countries. Gillard later clarified her statement as referring to \"the original theft of the material by a junior U.S. serviceman rather than any action by Mr Assange.\" Spencer Zifcak, president of Liberty Victoria, an Australian civil liberties group, notes that without a charge or a trial completed, it is inappropriate to state that WikiLeaks is guilty of illegal activities.\n\nOn threats by various governments towards Julian Assange, legal expert Ben Saul argues that Assange is the target of a global smear campaign to demonise him as a criminal or as a terrorist, without any legal basis. The US Center for Constitutional Rights has issued a statement emphasising its alarm at the \"multiple examples of legal overreach and irregularities\" in his arrest.\n\nIn a UK Supreme Court judgement given on 8 February 2018, the court unanimously decided that a document leaked through WikiLeaks \"could be admitted into evidence\".\n\nThe appeal that led to this ruling centred on a US government cable provided by Chelsea Manning and published by WikiLeaks. The Chagos islanders argued that the document showed the UK's motive for setting up a marine park on their territory was improper, but it had been excluded from proceedings earlier in the case.\n\nIn an \"important test of Vienna Convention in relation to Wikileaks documents\" The Court ruled that \"the cable should have been admitted into evidence before the Administrative Court\", addressing the main issue. During this decision, the leaked document was said to not meet the criteria necessary to help the Chagos Refugee Group recover their homeland.\n\nWikiLeaks is a self-described not-for-profit organisation, funded largely by volunteers, and it is dependent on public donations. Its main financing methods include conventional bank transfers and online payment systems. According to Assange, WikiLeaks' lawyers often work pro bono. Assange has said that in some cases legal aid has been donated by media organisations such as the Associated Press, the \"Los Angeles Times\", and the National Newspaper Publishers Association. Assange said in 2010 that WikiLeaks' only revenue consists of donations, but it has considered other options including auctioning early access to documents. During September 2011, WikiLeaks began auctioning items on eBay to raise funds, and Assange told an audience at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas that the organisation might not be able to survive.\n\nOn 24 December 2009, WikiLeaks announced that it was experiencing a shortage of funds and suspended all access to its website except for a form to submit new material. Material that was previously published was no longer available, although some could still be accessed on unofficial mirror websites. WikiLeaks stated on its website that it would resume full operation once the operational costs were paid. WikiLeaks saw this as a kind of work stoppage \"to ensure that everyone who is involved stops normal work and actually spends time raising revenue\". While the organisation initially planned for funds to be secured by 6 January 2010, it was not until 3 February 2010 that WikiLeaks announced that its minimum fundraising goal had been achieved.\n\nThe Wau Holland Foundation helps to process donations to WikiLeaks. In July 2010, the Foundation stated that WikiLeaks was not receiving any money for personnel costs, only for hardware, travelling and bandwidth. An article in TechEye stated: \n\nHowever, in December 2010 the Wau Holland Foundation stated that 4 permanent employees, including Julian Assange, had begun to receive salaries.\n\nIn 2010, Assange said the organisation was registered as a library in Australia, a foundation in France, and a newspaper in Sweden, and that it also used two United States-based non-profit 501c3 organisations for funding purposes.\n\nOn 22 January 2010, the Internet payment intermediary PayPal suspended WikiLeaks' donation account and froze its assets. WikiLeaks said that this had happened before, and was done for \"no obvious reason\". The account was restored on 25 January 2010. On 18 May 2010, WikiLeaks announced that its website and archive were operational again.\n\nIn June 2010, WikiLeaks was a finalist for a grant of more than half a million dollars from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, but did not make the final approval. WikiLeaks commented via Twitter: \"WikiLeaks was highest rated project in the Knight challenge, strongly recommended to the board but gets no funding. Go figure.\" WikiLeaks said that the Knight foundation announced the award to \"'12 Grantees who will impact future of news' – but not WikiLeaks\" and questioned whether Knight foundation was \"really looking for impact\". A spokesman of the Knight Foundation disputed parts of WikiLeaks' statement, saying \"WikiLeaks was not recommended by Knight staff to the board.\" However, he declined to say whether WikiLeaks was the project rated highest by the Knight advisory panel, which consists of non-staffers, among them journalist Jennifer 8. Lee, who has done PR work for WikiLeaks with the press and on social networking websites.\n\nDuring 2010, WikiLeaks received €635,772.73 in PayPal donations, less €30,000 in PayPal fees, and €695,925.46 in bank transfers. €500,988.89 of the sum was received in the month of December, primarily as bank transfers as PayPal suspended payments 4 December. €298,057.38 of the remainder was received in April.\n\nThe Wau Holland Foundation, one of the WikiLeaks' main funding channels, stated that they received more than €900,000 in public donations between October 2009 and December 2010, of which €370,000 has been passed on to WikiLeaks. Hendrik Fulda, vice-president of the Wau Holland Foundation, mentioned that the Foundation had been receiving twice as many donations through PayPal as through normal banks, before PayPal's decision to suspend WikiLeaks' account. He also noted that every new WikiLeaks publication brought \"a wave of support\", and that donations were strongest in the weeks after WikiLeaks started publishing leaked diplomatic cables.\n\nThe Icelandic judiciary decided that Valitor (a company related to Visa and MasterCard) was violating the law when it prevented donation to the site by credit card. A justice ruled that the donations will be allowed to return to the site after 14 days or they would be fined in the amount of US$6,000 a day.\n\nWikiLeaks posted its first document in December 2006, a decision to assassinate government officials signed by Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys. In August 2007, the UK newspaper \"The Guardian\" published a story about corruption by the family of the former Kenyan leader Daniel arap Moi based on information provided via WikiLeaks. In November 2007, a March 2003 copy of \"Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta\" detailing the protocol of the US Army at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp was released. The document revealed that some prisoners were off-limits to the International Committee of the Red Cross, something that the US military had in the past denied repeatedly. In February 2008, WikiLeaks released allegations of illegal activities at the Cayman Islands branch of the Swiss Bank Julius Baer, which resulted in the bank suing WikiLeaks and obtaining an injunction which temporarily suspended the operation of wikileaks.org. The California judge had the service provider of WikiLeaks block the site's domain (wikileaks.org) on 18 February 2008, although the bank only wanted the documents to be removed but WikiLeaks had failed to name a contact. The website was instantly mirrored by supporters, and later that month the judge overturned his previous decision citing First Amendment concerns and questions about legal jurisdiction. In March 2008, WikiLeaks published what they referred to as \"the collected secret 'bibles' of Scientology\", and three days later received letters threatening to sue them for breach of copyright. In September 2008, during the 2008 United States presidential election campaigns, the contents of a Yahoo account belonging to Sarah Palin (the running mate of Republican presidential nominee John McCain) were posted on WikiLeaks after being hacked into by members of a group known as Anonymous. In November 2008, the membership list of the far-right British National Party was posted to WikiLeaks, after appearing briefly on a weblog. A year later, in October 2009, another list of BNP members was leaked.\n\nIn January 2009, WikiLeaks released 86 telephone intercept recordings of Peruvian politicians and businessmen involved in the 2008 Peru oil scandal. During February, WikiLeaks released 6,780 Congressional Research Service reports followed in March by a list of contributors to the Norm Coleman senatorial campaign and a set of documents belonging to Barclays Bank that had been ordered removed from the website of \"The Guardian\". In July, it released a report relating to a serious nuclear accident that had occurred at the Iranian Natanz nuclear facility in 2009. Later media reports have suggested that the accident was related to the Stuxnet computer worm. In September, internal documents from Kaupthing Bank were leaked, from shortly before the collapse of Iceland's banking sector, which caused the 2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis. The document shows that suspiciously large sums of money were loaned to various owners of the bank, and large debts written off. In October, Joint Services Protocol 440, a British document advising the security services on how to avoid documents being leaked, was published by WikiLeaks. Later that month, it announced that a super-injunction was being used by the commodities company Trafigura to stop \"The Guardian\" (London) from reporting on a leaked internal document regarding a toxic dumping incident in Côte d'Ivoire. In November, it hosted copies of e-mail correspondence between climate scientists, although they were not leaked originally to WikiLeaks. It also released 570,000 intercepts of pager messages sent on the day of the 11 September attacks. During 2008 and 2009, WikiLeaks published the alleged lists of forbidden or illegal web addresses for Australia, Denmark and Thailand. These were originally created to prevent access to child pornography and terrorism, but the leaks revealed that other sites featuring unrelated subjects were also listed.\n\nIn mid-February 2010, WikiLeaks received a leaked diplomatic cable from the United States Embassy in Reykjavik relating to the Icesave scandal, which they published on 18 February. The cable, known as Reykjavik 13, was the first of the classified documents WikiLeaks published among those allegedly provided to them by United States Army Private Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley). In March 2010, WikiLeaks released a secret 32-page US Department of Defense Counterintelligence Analysis Report written in March 2008 discussing the leaking of material by WikiLeaks and how it could be deterred. In April, a classified video of the 12 July 2007 Baghdad airstrike was released, showing two Reuters employees being fired at, after the pilots mistakenly thought the men were carrying weapons, which were in fact cameras. After the mistaken killing, the video shows US forces firing on a family van that stopped to pick up the bodies. In the week after the release, \"wikileaks\" was the search term with the most significant growth worldwide during the last seven days as measured by Google Insights. In June 2010, Manning was arrested after alleged chat logs were given to United States authorities by former hacker Adrian Lamo, in whom she had confided. Manning reportedly told Lamo she had leaked the \"Collateral Murder\" video, in addition to a video of the Granai airstrike and about 260,000 diplomatic cables, to WikiLeaks.\n\nIn July, WikiLeaks released 92,000 documents related to the war in Afghanistan between 2004 and the end of 2009 to the publications \"The Guardian\", \"The New York Times\" and \"Der Spiegel\". The documents detail individual incidents including \"friendly fire\" and civilian casualties. About 15,000 of the 92,000 documents have not yet been released by WikiLeaks, as the group is currently reviewing the documents to remove some of the sources of the information. WikiLeaks asked the Pentagon and human-rights groups to help remove names from the documents to reduce the potential harm caused by their release, but did not receive assistance. After the Love Parade stampede in Duisburg, Germany, on 24 July 2010, a local resident published internal documents of the city administration regarding the planning of Love Parade. The city government reacted by securing a court order on 16 August forcing the removal of the documents from the website on which it was hosted. On 20 August 2010, WikiLeaks released a publication entitled \"Loveparade 2010 Duisburg planning documents, 2007–2010\", which comprised 43 internal documents regarding the Love Parade 2010. After the leak of information concerning the Afghan War, in October 2010, around 400,000 documents relating to the Iraq War were released. The BBC quoted the US Department of Defense referring to the Iraq War Logs as \"the largest leak of classified documents in its history\". Media coverage of the leaked documents emphasised claims that the US government had ignored reports of torture by the Iraqi authorities during the period after the 2003 war.\n\nOn 29 July 2010 WikiLeaks added an \"Insurance file\" to the Afghan War Diary page. The file is AES encrypted. There has been speculation that it was intended to serve as insurance in case the WikiLeaks website or its spokesman Julian Assange are incapacitated, upon which the passphrase could be published. After the first few days' release of the US diplomatic cables starting 28 November 2010, the US television broadcasting company CBS predicted that \"If anything happens to Assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files. There would then be no way to stop the information from spreading like wildfire because so many people already have copies.\" CBS correspondent Declan McCullagh stated, \"What most folks are speculating is that the insurance file contains unreleased information that would be especially embarrassing to the US government if it were released.\"\n\nOn 28 November 2010, WikiLeaks and five major newspapers from Spain (\"El País\"), France (\"Le Monde\"), Germany (\"Der Spiegel\"), the United Kingdom (\"The Guardian\"), and the United States (\"The New York Times\") started simultaneously to publish the first 220 of 251,287 leaked documents labelled confidential – but not top-secret – and dated from 28 December 1966 to 28 February 2010. WikiLeaks planned to release the entirety of the cables in phases over several months.\nThe contents of the diplomatic cables include numerous unguarded comments and revelations regarding: critiques and praises about the host countries of various United States embassies; political manoeuvring regarding climate change; discussion and resolutions towards ending ongoing tension in the Middle East; efforts and resistance towards nuclear disarmament; actions in the War on Terror; assessments of other threats around the world; dealings between various countries; United States intelligence and counterintelligence efforts; and other diplomatic actions. Reactions to the United States diplomatic cables leak varied. On 14 December 2010 the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks. Twitter decided to notify its users. The overthrow of the presidency in Tunisia of 2011 has been attributed partly to reaction against the corruption revealed by leaked cables.\n\nOn 1 September 2011, it became public that an encrypted version of WikiLeaks' huge archive of unredacted US State Department cables had been available via BitTorrent for months and that the decryption key (similar to a password) was available to those who knew where to find it. \"Guardian\" newspaper editor David Leigh had just published the decryption key in his book, so the files were now publicly available to anyone. Rather than let malicious actors publish selected data, WikiLeaks decided to publish the entire, unredacted archive in searchable form on its website.\n\nIn late April 2011, files related to the Guantanamo prison were released. In December 2011, WikiLeaks started to release the \"Spy Files\". On 27 February 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing more than five million emails from the Texas-headquartered \"global intelligence\" company Stratfor. On 5 July 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing the Syria Files (emails from Syrian political figures 2006–2012). On 25 October 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing The Detainee Policies, files covering the rules and procedures for detainees in US military custody. In April 2013 WikiLeaks published more than 1.7 million US diplomatic and intelligence documents from the 1970s, including the Kissinger cables.\nIn 2013, the organisation assisted Edward Snowden (who is responsible for the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures) in leaving Hong Kong. Sarah Harrison, a WikiLeaks activist, accompanied Snowden on the flight. Scott Shane of \"The New York Times\" stated that the WikiLeaks involvement \"shows that despite its shoestring staff, limited fund-raising from a boycott by major financial firms, and defections prompted by Mr. Assange's personal troubles and abrasive style, it remains a force to be reckoned with on the global stage.\"\n\nIn September 2013, WikiLeaks published \"Spy Files 3\", 250 documents from more than 90 surveillance companies. On 13 November 2013, a draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership's Intellectual Property Rights chapter was published by WikiLeaks. On 10 June 2015, WikiLeaks published the draft on the Trans-Pacific Partnership's Transparency for Healthcare Annex, along with each country's negotiating position. On 19 June 2015 WikiLeaks began publishing The Saudi Cables: more than half a million cables and other documents from the Saudi Foreign Ministry that contain secret communications from various Saudi Embassies around the world.\n\nOn 23 June 2015, WikiLeaks published documents under the name of \"Espionnage Élysée\", which showed that NSA spied on the French government, including but not limited to then President Francois Hollande and his predecessors Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac. On 29 June 2015, WikiLeaks published more NSA top secrets intercepts regarding France, detailing an economic espionage against French companies and associations. In July 2015, WikiLeaks published documents which showed that the NSA had tapped the telephones of many German federal ministries, including that of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, for years since the 1990s. On 4 July 2015, WikiLeaks published documents which showed that 29 Brazilian government numbers were selected for secret espionage by the NSA. Among the targets there were also the President Dilma Rousseff, many assistants and advisors, her presidential jet and other key figures in the Brazilian government.\n\nOn 29 July 2015, WikiLeaks published a top secret letter from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) Ministerial Meeting in December 2013 which illustrated the position of negotiating countries on \"state-owned enterprises\" (SOEs). On 31 July 2015, WikiLeaks published secret intercepts and the related target list showing that the NSA spied on Japanese government, including the Cabinet and Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui. The documents revealed that United States espionage against Japan concerned broad sections of communications about the US-Japan diplomatic relationship and Japan's position on climate change issues, other than an extensive monitoring of the Japanese economy. On 21 October 2015 WikiLeaks published some of John O. Brennan's emails, including a draft security clearance application which contained personal information.\n\nOn 4 July 2016, WikiLeaks tweeted a link to a trove of emails sent or received by then-US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and released under the Freedom of Information Act. The link contained 1258 emails sent from Clinton's personal mail server which were selected in terms of their relevance to the Iraq War and were apparently timed to precede the release of the UK government's Iraq Inquiry report.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, in response to the Turkish government's purges that followed the coup attempt, WikiLeaks released 294,548 emails from Turkey's ruling Justice and Development party (AKP). According to WikiLeaks, the material, which they claim to be the first batch from the \"AKP Emails\", was obtained a week before the attempted coup in the country and \"is not connected, in any way, to the elements behind the attempted coup, or to a rival political party or state\". After WikiLeaks announced that they would release the emails, the organisation stayed for over 24 hours under a \"sustained attack\". Following the leak, the Turkish government ordered the site to be blocked nationwide. WikiLeaks had also tweeted a link to a database which contained sensitive information, such as the Turkish Identification Number, of approximately 50 million Turkish citizens, including nearly every female voter in Turkey. This information first appeared online in April of the same year and was not in the files uploaded by WikiLeaks, but in files archived by Michael Best, who then removed it when the personal data was discovered.\n\nOn 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released approximately 20,000 emails and 8,000 files sent from or received by Democratic National Committee (DNC) personnel. Some of the emails contained personal information of donors, including home addresses and Social Security numbers. Other emails appeared to criticise Bernie Sanders and showed apparent favouritism towards Clinton.\n\nOn 7 October 2016, WikiLeaks started releasing series of emails and documents sent from or received by Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, including Hillary Clinton's paid speeches to banks. According to a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, \"By dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing Vladimir Putin's dirty work to help elect Donald Trump.\" \"The New York Times\" reported that when asked, president Vladimir Putin replied that Russia was being falsely accused. \"The hysteria is merely caused by the fact that somebody needs to divert the attention of the American people from the essence of what was exposed by the hackers.\"\n\nOn 17 October 2016 WikiLeaks announced that a \"state party\" had severed the Internet connection of Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy. WikiLeaks blamed United States Secretary of State John Kerry of pressuring the Ecuadorian government in severing Assange's Internet, an accusation which the United States State Department denied. The Ecuadorian government stated that it had \"temporarily\" severed Assange's Internet connection because of WikiLeaks' release of documents \"impacting on the U.S. election campaign,\" although it also stated that this was not meant to prevent WikiLeaks from operating.\n\nOn 16 February 2017, WikiLeaks released a purported report on CIA espionage orders (marked as NOFORN) for the 2012 French presidential election. The order called for details of party funding, internal rivalries and future attitudes toward the United States. The Associated Press noted that \"the orders seemed to represent standard intelligence-gathering.\"\n\nOn 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks started publishing content code-named \"Vault 7\". In a series of tweets and a Facebook Live + Periscope press conference, WikiLeaks announced these documents contain CIA internal documentation of their \"massive arsenal\" of hacking tools including malware, viruses trojects, weaponised \"zero day\" exploits and remote control systems to name a few. Leaked documents, dated from 2013–2016, detail the capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera Software ASA), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nOn 5 May 2017, WikiLeaks posted links to e-mails purported to be from Emmanuel Macron's campaign in the French 2017 presidential election. The documents were first relayed on the 4chan forum and by pro-Trump Twitter accounts, and then by WikiLeaks, who indicated they did not author the leaks. Experts have asserted that the WikiLeaks Twitter account played a key role in publicising the leaks through the hashtag #MacronLeaks just some three-and-a-half hours after the first tweet with hashtag appeared. The campaign stated that false documents were mixed in with real ones, and that \"the ambition of the authors of this leak is obviously to harm the movement En Marche! in the final hours before the second round of the French presidential election\". France's Electoral Commission described the action as a \"massive and coordinated piracy action\". France's Electoral Commission urged journalists not to report on the contents of the leaks, but to heed \"the sense of responsibility they must demonstrate, as at stake are the free expression of voters and the sincerity of the election\". Cybersecurity experts initially believed that groups linked to Russia were involved in this attack. The Kremlin denied any involvement. The head of the French cyber-security agency, ANSSI, later said that they did not have evidence connecting the hack with Russia, saying that the attack was so simple, that \"we can imagine that it was a person who did this alone. They could be in any country.\"\n\nIn September 2017, WikiLeaks released \"Spy Files Russia,\" revealing \"how a St. Petersburg-based technology company called Peter-Service helped state entities gather detailed data on Russian cellphone users, part of a national system of online surveillance called System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM).\"\n\nIn January 2011, Rudolf Elmer, a former Swiss banker, passed data containing account details of 2,000 prominent people to Assange, who stated that the information will be vetted before being made publicly available at a later date. In May 2010, WikiLeaks said it had video footage of a massacre of civilians in Afghanistan by the US military which they were preparing to release. In an interview with Chris Anderson on 19 July 2010, Assange showed a document WikiLeaks had on an Albanian oil-well blowout, and said they also had material from inside British Petroleum, and that they were \"getting enormous quantity of whistle-blower disclosures of a very high calibre\" but added that they had not been able to verify and release the material because they did not have enough volunteer journalists. In December 2010, Assange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, told \"The Andrew Marr Show\" on BBC Television that WikiLeaks had information it considered to be a \"thermo-nuclear device\" which it would release if the organisation needs to defend itself against the authorities.\n\nIn a 2009 interview by the magazine \"Computerworld\", Assange claimed to be in possession of \"5GB from Bank of America\". In 2010, he told \"Forbes\" magazine that WikiLeaks was planning another \"megaleak\" early in 2011, from the private sector, involving \"a big U.S. bank\" and revealing an \"ecosystem of corruption\". Bank of America's stock price decreased by 3%, apparently as a result of this announcement. Assange commented on the possible effect of the release that \"it could take down a bank or two\". In August 2011, Reuters announced that Daniel Domscheit-Berg had destroyed approximately 5GB of data cache from Bank of America, that Assange had under his control.\n\nIn October 2010, Assange told a major Moscow newspaper that \"The Kremlin had better brace itself for a coming wave of WikiLeaks disclosures about Russia\". Assange later clarified: \"we have material on many businesses and governments, including in Russia. It's not right to say there's going to be a particular focus on Russia\".\n\nWikiLeaks has contended that it has never released a misattributed document and that documents are assessed before release. In response to concerns about the possibility of misleading or fraudulent leaks, WikiLeaks has stated that misleading leaks \"are already well-placed in the mainstream media. WikiLeaks is of no additional assistance.\" The FAQ states that: \"The simplest and most effective countermeasure is a worldwide community of informed users and editors who can scrutinise and discuss leaked documents.\" According to statements by Assange in 2010, submitted documents are vetted by a group of five reviewers, with expertise in different topics such as language or programming, who also investigate the background of the leaker if his or her identity is known. In that group, Assange has the final decision about the assessment of a document.\n\nColumnist Eric Zorn wrote in 2016 that \"it's possible, even likely, that every stolen email WikiLeaks has posted has been authentic.\" (Writer Glenn Greenwald goes further, asserting that WikiLeaks has a \"perfect, long-standing record of only publishing authentic documents.\") However, cybersecurity experts agree that it is trivially easy for a person to fabricate an email or alter it, as by changing headers and metadata. Some of the more recent releases, such as many of the emails contained in the Podesta emails, contain DKIM headers. This allows them to be verified as genuine to some degree of certainty.\n\nIn July 2016, the Aspen Institute's Homeland Security Group, a bipartisan counterterrorism organisation, warned that hackers who stole authentic data might \"salt the files they release with plausible forgeries.\" Russian intelligence agencies have frequently used disinformation tactics, \"which means carefully faked emails might be included in the WikiLeaks dumps. After all, the best way to make false information believable is to mix it in with true information.\"\n\nWikiLeaks has promoted conspiracy theories about the murder of Seth Rich. Unfounded conspiracy theories, spread by some right-wing figures and media outlets, hold that Rich was the source of leaked emails and was killed for working with WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks fuelled the conspiracy theories by offering a reward of $20,000 for information leading to the capture of Rich's killer and hinting that Rich may have been the source of the leaked emails. No evidence supports the claim that Rich was the source of the leaks.\n\nThe \"Guardian\" wrote that WikiLeaks, along with individuals and groups on the hard right, had been involved in the \"ruthless exploitation of [Rich's] death for political purposes\". The executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, an organization that advocates for open government, was critical of WikiLeaks' fueling of conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich: \"If they feel like they have a link to the staffer's death, they should say it and be responsible about it. The insinuations, to me, are just disgusting.\"\n\nWikiLeaks has popularized conspiracies about the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, such as tweeting an article which suggested Clinton campaign chairperson John Podesta engaged in satanic rituals (which was later revealed to be false), implying that the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed, suggesting that Clinton wore earpieces to debates and interviews, claiming that Hillary Clinton wanted to drone strike Assange, promoting conspiracy theories about Clinton's health, and promoting a conspiracy theory from a Donald Trump–related Internet community tying the Clinton campaign to child kidnapper Laura Silsby.\n\nShort of simply disclosing information in the public interest, WikiLeaks has been accused of purposely targeting certain states and people, and presenting its disclosures in misleading and conspiratorial ways to harm those people. Writing in 2012, \"Foreign Policy\"'s Joshua Keating noted that \"nearly all its major operations have targeted the U.S. government or American corporations.\" In a 2017 speech addressing the Center for Strategic and International Studies, CIA Director Mike Pompeo referred to WikiLeaks as \"a non-state hostile intelligence service\" and described founder Julian Assange as a narcissist, fraud, and coward.\n\nAssange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: \"I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgement and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ...  she certainly should not become president of the United States.\" In July 2017, during an interview by Amy Goodman, Julian Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea. \"Personally, I would prefer neither.\" WikiLeaks editor, Sarah Harrison, has stated that the site is not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information that is available to them.\n\nIn conversations that were leaked in February 2018, WikiLeaks expressed a preference for a Republican victory in the 2016 election.\n\nHaving released information that exposed the inner working of a broad range of organisations and politicians, WikiLeaks started by 2016 to focus almost exclusively on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In the 2016 US presidential election, WikiLeaks only exposed material damaging to the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks even rejected the opportunity to publish unrelated leaks, because it dedicated all its resources to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. According to \"The New York Times\", WikiLeaks timed one of its large leaks so that it would happen on the eve of the Democratic Convention. The \"Washington Post\" noted that the leaks came at an important sensitive moment in the Clinton campaign, as she was preparing to announce her vice-presidential pick and unite the party behind her. The Sunlight Foundation, an organisation that advocates for open government, said that such actions meant that WikiLeaks was no longer striving to be transparent but rather sought to achieve political goals: \"It's become something else. It's not striving for objectivity. It's more careless. When they publish information it appears to be in service of some specific goal, of retribution, at the expense of the individual.\"\n\nWikiLeaks explained its actions in a 2017 statement to \"Foreign Policy\": \"WikiLeaks schedules publications to maximize readership and reader engagement. During distracting media events such as the Olympics or a high profile election, unrelated publications are sometimes delayed until the distraction passes but never are rejected for this reason.\" On 7 October 2016, an hour after the media had begun to dedicate wall-to-wall coverage of the revelation that Trump had bragged on video about sexually harassing women, WikiLeaks began to release emails hacked from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. CNN notes that due to extensive coverage of the Trump tapes, the leaks were an \"afterthought\" in news coverage. Podesta suggested that the emails were timed to deflect attention from the Trump tapes.\n\nIn 2010, Donald Trump called WikiLeaks \"disgraceful\" and suggested that the \"death penalty\" should be a punishment for WikiLeaks' releases of information. Following the dump of e-mails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign, Donald Trump told voters, \"I love WikiLeaks!\" Trump made many references to WikiLeaks during the course of the campaign; by one estimate, he referenced disclosures by WikiLeaks over 160 times in speeches during the last 30 days of the campaign.\n\nIn November 2017, it was revealed that the WikiLeaks Twitter account corresponded with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential election. The correspondence shows how WikiLeaks actively solicited the co-operation of Trump Jr., a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it looked as if the Trump campaign would lose. WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share a false claim by Assange that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack him with drones. WikiLeaks also shared a link to a site that would help people to search through WikiLeaks documents. Trump Jr. shared both. After the election, WikiLeaks also requested that the president-elect push Australia to appoint Assange as ambassador to the US. After \"The New York Times\" published a fragment of Donald Trump's tax returns for one year, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for one or more of his father's tax returns, explaining that it would be in his father's best interest because it would \"dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality\" and not come \"through the most biased source (e.g. NYT/MSNBC).\" WikiLeaks also asked Trump Jr. to leak his own e-mails to them days after \"The New York Times\" broke a story about e-mail correspondence between Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-affiliated lawyer; WikiLeaks said that it would be \"beautifully confounding\" for them to publish the e-mails and that it would deprive other news outlets from putting a negative spin on the correspondence. Trump Jr. provided this correspondence to congressional investigators looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIn August 2016, after WikiLeaks published thousands of DNC emails, it was claimed that Russian intelligence had hacked the e-mails and leaked them to WikiLeaks. At the time, DNC officials made such claims, along with a number of cybersecurity experts and cybersecurity firms. In October 2016, the US intelligence community announced that it was \"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations\". The US intelligence agencies said that the hacks were consistent with the methods of Russian-directed efforts, and that people high up within the Kremlin were likely involved. On 14 October 2016, CNN reported that \"there is mounting evidence that the Russian government is supplying WikiLeaks with hacked emails pertaining to the U.S. presidential election.\" WikiLeaks has denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia. President Putin has strongly denied any Russian involvement in the election.\n\nIn September 2016, the German weekly magazine \"Focus\" reported that according to a confidential German government dossier, WikiLeaks had long since been infiltrated by Russian agents aiming to discredit NATO governments. The magazine added that French and British intelligence services had come to the same conclusion and said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev receive details about what WikiLeaks publishes before publication. The \"Focus\" report followed a \"New York Times\" story that suggested that WikiLeaks may be a laundering machine for compromising material about Western countries gathered by Russian spies.\n\nOn 10 December 2016, several news outlets, including \"The Guardian\" and \"The Washington Post\", reported that the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Russia intelligence operatives provided materials to WikiLeaks in an effort to help Donald Trump's election bid. \"The Washington Post\" article stated: \"The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.\" \"The Guardian\" article reported, \"individuals linked to the Russian government had provided WikiLeaks with thousands of confidential emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and others.\" WikiLeaks has frequently been criticised for its absence of whistleblowing on or criticism of Russia. \"The Guardian\" notes that journalists are killed frequently in Russia, and notes that \"Freedom House\" has ranked Russian press freedom as \"not free ... The main national news agenda is firmly controlled by the Kremlin. The government sets editorial policy at state-owned television stations, which dominate the media landscape and generate propagandistic content.\n\nIn April 2016, WikiLeaks tweeted criticism of the Panama Papers, which had among other things revealed Russian businesses and individuals linked with offshore ties (Vladimir Putin's associates had as much as $2 billion in offshore accounts). The WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted, \"#PanamaPapers Putin attack was produced by OCCRP which targets Russia & former USSR and was funded by USAID and [George] Soros\". Putin would later go on to dismiss the Panama Papers by citing WikiLeaks: \"WikiLeaks has showed us that official people and official organs of the U.S. are behind this.\" According to \"The New York Times\", both Assange claims are substance-free: \"there is no evidence suggesting that the United States government had a role in releasing the Panama Papers.\" Assange also falsely asserted that the Panama Papers gave Western figures a free pass, when the leaks in fact reported on a number of high-profile Western politicians, including UK Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nIn 2012 when WikiLeaks began to run out of funds, Assange began to host a television show on Russia Today, Russia's state-owned news network. Assange has never disclosed how much he or WikiLeaks were paid for his tv-show.\n\nAfter President Trump's National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn resigned in February 2017 due to reports over his communications with Russian officials and subsequent lies over the content and nature of those communications, WikiLeaks tweeted that Flynn resigned \"after destabilization campaign by U.S. spies, Democrats, press.\"\n\nIn April 2017, the WikiLeaks Twitter account suggested that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, which international human rights organisations and governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, France, and Israel attributed to the Syrian government, was a false flag attack. WikiLeaks stated that \"while western establishment media beat the drum for more war in Syria the matter is far from clear\", and shared a video by a Syrian activist who claimed that Islamist extremists were probably behind the chemical attack, not the Syrian government.\n\nIn May 2017, cybersecurity experts stated that they believed that groups affiliated with the Russian government were involved in the hacking and leaking of e-mails associated with the Emmanuel Macron campaign; these e-mails were published on Pastebin but heavily promoted by WikiLeaks social media channels.\n\nIn April 2017, CIA Director Mike Pompeo stated: \"It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is – a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.\" Pompeo said that the US Intelligence Community had concluded that Russia's \"primary propaganda outlet,\" RT had \"actively collaborated\" with WikiLeaks.\n\nIn August 2017, \"Foreign Policy\" reported that WikiLeaks had in the summer of 2016 turned down a large cache of documents containing information damaging to the Russian government. WikiLeaks justified this by saying \"As far as we recall these are already public ... WikiLeaks rejects all information that it cannot verify. WikiLeaks rejects submissions that have already been published elsewhere\". Whereas news outlets had reported on some contents of the leaks in 2014, the information that news outlets reported on was less than half of the data that was made available to WikiLeaks in the summer of 2016.\n\nIn October 2017, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a company working on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign, had contacted WikiLeaks about missing Hillary Clinton e-mails and the possibility of creating a searchable database for the campaign to use. After this was reported, Assange confirmed that WikiLeaks had been approached by Cambridge Analytica but had rejected the approach. WikiLeaks did not disclose what the subject of Cambridge Analytica's approach was.\n\nWikiLeaks has been accused of anti-semitism. The WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted anti-semitic jibes. The organisation has called out Jewish \"lobbies\" and claimed that a \"Jewish conspiracy\" is attempting to discredit the organisation. In July 2016, WikiLeaks suggested that triple parentheses, or (((echoes))) – a tool used by neo-Nazis to identify Jews on Twitter, appropriated by Jews across the Twittersphere – had been used as a way for \"establishment climbers\" to identify one another. Assange denied making claims of a Jewish conspiracy, stating, \"'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and in word. It is serious and upsetting.\"\n\nIn leaked internal conversations, WikiLeaks described a journalist as a \"rat\" and noted that \"he's Jewish\". WikiLeaks also noted that the journalist had been \"engaged\" in the contesting anti-Semitic jibes on Twitter, and encouraged others to troll the journalist.\n\nWikiLeaks has been criticised for making misleading claims about the contents of its leaks. Media outlets have also been criticised for reporting on WikiLeaks' claims about the CIA leak, which were later retracted.\n\nAccording to University of North Carolina Professor Zeynep Tufekci, this is part of a pattern of behaviour. After the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, WikiLeaks announced that it would release e-mails belonging to Turkey's ruling conservative Justice and Development Party. WikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents as a response to the Turkish government's crackdown on real or alleged government opponents that followed the coup attempt. When these e-mails were released, however, it \"was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks.\" According to Tufekci, there are three steps to WikiLeaks' \"disinformation campaigns\": \"The first step is to dump many documents at once — rather than allowing journalists to scrutinise them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalise the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit back and watch as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting.\"\n\nWikiLeaks has drawn criticism for violating the personal privacy of a multitude of individuals and inadequately curating its content. These critics include transparency advocates, such as Edward Snowden, the Sunlight Foundation and the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nWikiLeaks has published individuals' Social Security numbers, medical information, and credit card numbers. An analysis by the Associated Press found that WikiLeaks had in one of its mass-disclosures published \"the personal information of hundreds of people – including sick children, rape victims and mental health patients\". WikiLeaks has named teenage rape victims, and outed an individual arrested for homosexuality in Saudi Arabia. Some of WikiLeaks' cables \"described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees\". An analysis of WikiLeaks' Saudi cables \"turned up more than 500 passport, identity, academic or employment files ... three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables – including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates that reveal whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who says his wife stole his money. One divorce document details a male partner's infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C.\" Two individuals named in the DNC leaks were targeted by identity thieves following WikiLeaks' reveal of their Social Security and credit card information. In its leak of DNC e-mails, WikiLeaks revealed the details of an ordinary staffer's suicide attempt and brought attention to it through a tweet.\n\nWikiLeaks' publishing of Sony's hacked e-mails drew criticism for violating the privacy of Sony's employees and for failing to be in the public interest. Michael A. Cohen, a fellow at the Century Foundation, argues that \"data dumps like these represent a threat to our already shrinking zone of privacy.\" He noted that the willingness of WikiLeaks to publish information of this type encourages hacking and cybertheft: \"With ready and willing amplifiers, what's to deter the next cyberthief from stealing a company's database of information and threatening to send it to Wikileaks if a list of demands aren't met?\"\n\nThe Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for open government, has criticised WikiLeaks for inadequate curation of its content and for \"weaponised transparency,\" writing that with the DNC leaks, \"Wikileaks again failed the due diligence review we expect of putatively journalistic entities when it published the personal information of ordinary citizens, including passport and Social Security numbers contained in the hacked emails of Democratic National Committee staff. We are not alone in raising ethical questions about Wikileaks' shift from whistleblower to platform for weaponised transparency. Any organisation that 'doxxes' a public is harming privacy.\" The manner in which WikiLeaks publishes content can have the effect of censoring political enemies: \"Wikileaks' indiscriminate disclosure in this case is perhaps the closest we've seen in reality to the bogeyman projected by enemies to reform — that transparency is just a Trojan Horse for chilling speech and silencing political enemies.\"\n\nIn July 2016, Edward Snowden criticised WikiLeaks for insufficiently curating its content. When Snowden made data public, he did so by working with the \"Washington Post\", the \"Guardian\" and other news organisations, choosing only to make documents public which exposed National Security Agency surveillance programs. Content that compromised national security or exposed sensitive personal information was withheld. WikiLeaks, on the other hand, makes little effort to remove sensitive personal information or withhold content with adverse national security implications. WikiLeaks responded by accusing Snowden of pandering to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina Professor Zeynep Tufekci has criticised WikiLeaks for exposing sensitive personal information: \"WikiLeaks, for example, gleefully tweeted to its millions of followers that a Clinton Foundation employee had attempted suicide ... Data dumps by WikiLeaks have outed rape victims and gay people in Saudi Arabia, private citizens' emails and personal information in Turkey, and the voice mail messages of Democratic National Committee staff members.\" She argues these data dumps which violate personal privacy without being in the public interest \"threaten our ability to dissent by destroying privacy and unleashing a glut of questionable information that functions, somewhat unexpectedly, as its own form of censorship, rather than as a way to illuminate the maneuverings of the powerful.\"\n\nIn January 2017, the WikiLeaks Task Force, a Twitter account associated with WikiLeaks, proposed the creation of a database to track verified Twitter users, including sensitive personal information on individuals' homes, families and finances. According to the \"Chicago Tribune\", \"the proposal faced a sharp and swift backlash as technologists, journalists and security researchers slammed the idea as a 'sinister' and dangerous abuse of power and privacy.\" Twitter furthermore bans the use of Twitter data for \"surveillance purposes,\" stating \"Posting another person's private and confidential information is a violation of the Twitter rules.\"\n\nWithin WikiLeaks, there has been public disagreement between founder and spokesperson Julian Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the website's former German representative who was suspended by Assange. Domscheit-Berg announced on 28 September 2010 that he was leaving the organisation due to internal conflicts over management of the website.\nOn 25 September 2010, after being suspended by Assange for \"disloyalty, insubordination and destabilisation\", Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the German spokesman for WikiLeaks, told \"Der Spiegel\" that he was resigning, saying \"WikiLeaks has a structural problem. I no longer want to take responsibility for it, and that's why I am leaving the project.\" Assange accused Domscheit-Berg of leaking information to \"Newsweek\", claiming the WikiLeaks team was unhappy with Assange's management and handling of the Afghan war document releases. Daniel Domscheit-Berg wanted greater transparency in the articles released to the public. Another vision of his was to focus on providing technology that allowed whistle-blowers to protect their identity as well as a more transparent way of communicating with the media, forming new partnerships and involving new people. Domscheit-Berg left with a small group to start OpenLeaks, a new leak organisation and website with a different management and distribution philosophy.\n\nWhile leaving, Daniel Domscheit-Berg copied and then deleted roughly 3,500 unpublished documents from the WikiLeaks servers, including information on the US government's 'no-fly list' and inside information from 20 right-wing organisations, and according to a WikiLeaks statement, 5 gigabytes of data relating to Bank of America, the internal communications of 20 neo-Nazi organisations and US intercept information for \"over a hundred Internet companies\". In Domscheit-Berg's book he wrote: \"To this day, we are waiting for Julian to restore security, so that we can return the material to him, which was on the submission platform.\" In August 2011, Domscheit-Berg claims he permanently deleted the files \"in order to ensure that the sources are not compromised.\"\n\nHerbert Snorrason, a 25-year-old Icelandic university student, resigned after he challenged Assange on his decision to suspend Domscheit-Berg and was bluntly rebuked. Iceland MP Birgitta Jónsdóttir also left WikiLeaks, citing lack of transparency, lack of structure, and poor communication flow in the organisation. According to the periodical \"The Independent\" (London), at least a dozen key supporters of WikiLeaks left the website during 2010.\n\nThose working for WikiLeaks are reportedly required to sign sweeping non-disclosure agreements covering all conversations, conduct, and material, with Assange having sole power over disclosure. The penalty for non-compliance in one such agreement was reportedly £12 million. WikiLeaks has been challenged for this practice, as it seen to be hypocritical for an organisation dedicated to transparency to limit the transparency of its inner workings and limit the accountability of powerful individuals in the organisation.\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the Democratic National Committee filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit in federal district court in Manhattan against Russia, the Trump campaign, WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, alleging a conspiracy to disrupt the 2016 United States presidential election in Trump's favor. WikiLeaks called the lawsuit a \"publicity stunt\" by the DNC and said, \"As an accurate publisher of newsworthy information @WikiLeaks is constitutionally protected from such suits.\" WikiLeaks added that they were considering filing a countersuit against the DNC.\n\nWikiLeaks has received praise as well as criticism. The organisation won a number of awards in its early years, including \"The Economist's\" New Media Award in 2008 at the Index on Censorship Awards and Amnesty International's UK Media Award in 2009. In 2010, the New York \"Daily News\" listed WikiLeaks first among websites \"that could totally change the news,\" and Julian Assange received the Sam Adams Award and was named the Readers' Choice for \"TIME's Person of the Year\" in 2010. The UK Information Commissioner has stated that \"WikiLeaks is part of the phenomenon of the online, empowered citizen.\" During its first days, an Internet petition in support of WikiLeaks attracted more than six hundred thousand signatures. \n\nSympathisers of WikiLeaks in the media and academia commended it during its early years for exposing state and corporate secrets, increasing transparency, assisting freedom of the press, and enhancing democratic discourse while challenging powerful institutions. In 2010, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over the \"cyber war\" being led at the time against WikiLeaks, and in a joint statement with the Organization of American States the UN Special Rapporteur called on states and other people to keep international legal principles in mind.\n\nSeveral Republicans who had once been highly critical of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange began to speak fondly of him after WikiLeaks published the DNC leaks and started to regularly criticise Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Having called WikiLeaks \"disgraceful\" in 2010, President-Elect Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks in October 2016, saying, \"I love WikiLeaks.\" Newt Gingrich, who called for Assange to be \"treated as an enemy combatant\" in 2010, praised him as a \"down to Earth, straight forward interviewee\" in 2017. Sean Hannity, who had in 2010 said that Assange waged a \"war\" on the United States, praised him in 2016 for showing \"how corrupt, dishonest and phony our government is\". Sarah Palin, who had in 2010 described Assange as an \"anti-American operative with blood on his hands\", lavished praise on him in 2017. Ann Coulter called for Assange to be awarded the presidential medal of freedom.\n\nAt the same time, several US government officials have criticised WikiLeaks for exposing classified information and claimed that the leaks harm national security and compromise international diplomacy. Several human rights organisations requested with respect to earlier document releases that WikiLeaks adequately redact the names of civilians working with international forces, to prevent repercussions. Some journalists have likewise criticised a perceived lack of editorial discretion when releasing thousands of documents at once and without sufficient analysis. In 2016, Harvard law professor and Electronic Frontier Foundation board member Jonathan Zittrain argued that a culture in which one constantly risks being \"outed\" as a result of virtual Watergate-like break-ins (or violations of the Fourth Amendment) could lead people to hesitate to speak their minds.\n\nIn April 2017, CIA Director Mike Pompeo called WikiLeaks \"a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia\".\n\nAlso in April 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated that arresting Julian Assange of WikiLeaks was a priority: \"We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious. So yes, it is a priority. We've already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail.\"\n\nIn 2011, hacktivist group Anonymous published a secret proposal presented by a Palantir Technologies employee to Hunton & Williams, a Washington, D.C. law firm, to attempt to discredit WikiLeaks and supporters such as Glenn Greenwald with disinformation and cyberattacks. Two other private security firms, Berico Technologies and HBGary, were also involved in the proposal. Palantir temporarily suspended the employee, its CEO Alex Karp apologised to Greenwald, and a spokesperson said the company would have collapsed if it had carried out the proposal.\n\nRelease of United States diplomatic cables was followed by the creation of a number of other organisations based on the WikiLeaks model.\n\nA thriller about WikiLeaks was released in the United States on 18 October 2013. The documentary \"\" by director Alex Gibney premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. \"War, Lies and Videotape\" is a documentary by French directors Paul Moreira and Luc Hermann from press agency Premieres Lignes. The film was first released in France, in 2011 and then broadcast worldwide. \"The Source\" is a 2014 oratorio by Ted Hearne, with a libretto by Mark Doten that features WikiLeaks document disclosures by Chelsea Manning.\n\n"}
{"id": "8395730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8395730", "title": "Yves Leopold Germain Gaston", "text": "Yves Leopold Germain Gaston\n\nYves Leopold Germain Gaston was the patriarch of a large family with roots in the City of Silay, in the province of Negros Occidental, Philippines.\n\nThe real and legal surname of Yves Leopold was in fact Germain. He was born in Lisieux, France, the twenty one of the month of Brumaire, Year twelve of the French Republic at six o’clock evening. (November 13, 1803 in Gregorian calendar). Son of Pierre Germain, National Gendarme professional, and Marie Anne Logre married. Later on, he adopted the very French-sounding name of Gaston, certainly because for a Frenchman, the surname Germain created too many problems and confusion. The Name Gaston was retained by the following generations as their surname.\n\nHe settled in the Philippines, where he is credited as the first to commercially produce cane sugar, the primary product of the province.\n\nGaston first moved to Calatagan, Batangas in 1837 to help Domingo Roxas, a prominent businessman, set up his sugar business. It was there that Gaston met Prudencia Fernandez, who later became his wife. When his partner's business did not prosper, the Frenchman decided to try his prospects first in Iloilo and from there, he ventured to Negros. He arrived at the port city of Silay in 1840, where he found the soil conducive to planting sugarcane. He brought in an iron mill or \"horno economico\", which at that time was virtually unheard of.\nThe iron mill allowed him to begin commercial production of export-quality sugar. The Spaniards endorsed his residence in the Philippines due of the impact of his technology on the economy. He had become a sugar baron and was exporting the product alongside Nicholas Loney, the first British vice-consul in the country who, because of his efforts to promote sugar, became known as the \"Father of the Sugar Industry.\" Gaston later decided to bring his family to back to France. However, on the way, he fell ill and eventually died. His wife and three children, not knowing a word of French, returned to Silay and permanently settled there, continuing the family business. The sugar industry soon peaked, and sugarcane became the staple crop throughout Negros Occidental.\n\nThe house of Gaston's eldest son is now a museum open to the public and is fondly called the \"Balay Negrense\" (Hiligaynon, \"The Negrense House\").\nJosé Gaston, grandson of Yves Leopold Germain Gaston, built another house called the \"Hacienda Rosalia\" in Manapla, Negros Occidental, also open to the public.\n\n"}
