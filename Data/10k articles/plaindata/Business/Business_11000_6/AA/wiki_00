{"id": "37471093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37471093", "title": "Brian Gallant", "text": "Brian Gallant\n\nBrian Alexander Gallant, QC (born April 27, 1982) is a Canadian politician who served as the 33rd Premier of New Brunswick from October 7, 2014 until November 9, 2018. Of Acadian and Dutch descent, Gallant practised as a lawyer before winning the Liberal leadership in October 2012, securing the riding of Kent in a by-election on April 15, 2013, shortly followed by his swearing in as Leader of the Opposition. After the 2014 election, in which the Progressive Conservative government of David Alward was defeated, Gallant represents the riding of Shediac Bay-Dieppe.\n\nGallant announced, on November 15, 2018, that he will be stepping down as Liberal leader as soon as a leadership election is held to choose his successor.\n\nAt age 32, he was the second youngest Premier of New Brunswick to assume office (George Edwin King became premier at age 30 in 1870.) When Gallant left office at age 36, he was the youngest premier in Canada.\nGallant was born in Shediac Bridge. His Acadian father, Pierre, was the youngest of seven children, while his mother, Marilyn (born Scholten), was the child of Dutch immigrants who arrived in the 1950s. He also has two siblings, Melissa and Pierre. In his youth, he was educated at a variety of schools across New Brunswick; he ascribed his many moves to his parents' search for work, labouring at minimum wage jobs in convenience stores and fast food restaurants, eventually having to move the family into the small home of Gallant's grandparents. He ended up graduating from Polyvalente Louis-J.-Robichaud back in Shediac - his principal recalled telling Gallant he predicted he would one day be Premier, saying, \"You have all the qualities of being a future premier here in New Brunswick.\" Gallant says his interest in politics started when, with nobody else offering, he became vice president of his grade 5 class, and by the end of his teenage years he decided he would pursue a political career.\n\nIn order to pay his way through university, he started and ran two small companies, eventually allowing him to graduate from the Université de Moncton with both a BA in Business Administration and a Bachelor of Laws degree, later receiving a Master's in Law from McGill University. Whilst at Moncton, he was made president of the student federation. Afterwards, he practised corporate and commercial law with the firm Stewart McKelvey, and then became a partner at Veritas Law in Dieppe.\n\nHis first foray into provincial politics was an ambitious one as, at 24, he secured the Liberal nomination to run against Premier Bernard Lord in the Progressive Conservative's riding of Moncton East for the 2006 election. Although in the end Lord held his seat, the election was far from being a runaway. The campaign against a sitting premier gave added exposure to Gallant.\n\nWhen the Liberal government of Shawn Graham was defeated in 2010, Gallant authored a paper on reforming the Liberal Party, to make it more accessible for new members and a new generation of leaders to emerge; many of its recommendations were reportedly adopted. After Graham's resignation as leader of the party, Gallant put himself forward to succeed him, winning against former justice minister Mike Murphy and dairy farmer Nick Duivenvorden in its 2012 leadership election. After a successful by-election run in Graham's former riding of Kent, where he gained a commanding lead, Gallant was sworn into the Legislative Assembly on April 30, 2013, making him Leader of the Opposition to David Alward's PC government.\n\nHeading into the 2014 election campaign, Gallant pushed a $900 million package of infrastructure spending over six years as a way to create 1,700 jobs for a province with one of the country's worst unemployment rates. He also campaigned on a tax rise for some of the province's biggest earners, and on removing property tax breaks for businesses. The Liberal platform also promised a rise in the minimum wage, from $10 per hour, to $10.30 per hour by the end of 2014, and to $11 by the end of 2017.\n\nOn an election night marred by technical glitches with the voting tabulators, the Liberals won a majority and formed the government in the 58th New Brunswick Legislature with Gallant as Premier on October 7, 2014. Gallant's first cabinet, of 13 members, was less numerous than the outgoing cabinet.\n\nOn 1 December 2015, the Gallant government opened the legislature's second session with a promise to \"get tough\" on the province's tattered finances. The speech from the throne documented how the province had accumulated a debt of $12.4 billion by failing to produce a balanced budget since 2007. The province spent more on interest payments than it did on post-secondary education, and the consultation of citizens called the \"Strategic Program Review\" had all but concluded. The province said its credit rating was at risk, and the costs to service the debt if the rating were downgraded would then rise. The projected deficit for the 2015-16 budget was at the time $453 million. A report issued the previous Friday had calculated at $300 million the benefit to the government of a two-percent rise of the Harmonised Sales Tax from 13% to 15%.\n\nThe 2018 provincial election resulted in Gallant's Liberals winning only 21 seats compared to Blaine Higgs and the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick who won 22. Gallant vowed to attempt to remain in power with a minority government and hoped to retain the confidence of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick either on a vote-by-vote basis or with the agreement of the smaller parties, the Green Party of New Brunswick and the People's Alliance of New Brunswick, each of which won 3 seats in the election.\n\nOn November 2, 2018 Gallant's Liberal minority government was defeated by a confidence vote on its throne speech by a margin of 25 to 23 with the opposition Progressive Conservatives and People's Alliance voting against the government and the Greens voting with the government.\n\nGallant resigned as premier on November 9, 2018. Blaine Higgs was appointed in his place.\n\n \n"}

He is currently a Co-Chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a strategic advisory firm,\n\nGutierrez is a former Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Kellogg Company. He served as the 35th U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 2005 to 2009.\n\nGutierrez is of Spanish descent. He was born in Havana, Cuba, the son of a pineapple plantation owner. As a successful businessman, his father was deemed an enemy of the state by Fidel Castro's regime. Faced with the expropriation of their property following the Cuban Revolution, Gutierrez's family fled for the United States in 1960, when he was six years old, settling in Miami.\n\nWhen it became apparent they would not be returning to Cuba, Gutierrez's father accepted a position with the H. J. Heinz Company in Mexico and later started his own business. Gutierrez learned his first words of English from the bellhop at the hotel where they initially stayed and, some years later, he and his family acquired United States citizenship.\n\nGutierrez studied business administration at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education campus in Querétaro but never received a degree, making him the most recent U.S. Cabinet member without a college degree.\n\nGutierrez joined Kellogg's in Mexico in 1975, at the age of 22, as a sales representative and management trainee. One of his early assignments was driving a delivery-truck route around local stores.\n\nGutierrez rose through the management ranks. In January 1990 he was promoted to corporate vice president of product development at the company's headquarters in Battle Creek, Michigan, and in July of that year, he became executive vice president of Kellogg USA. In January 1999, he was elected to the company's board of directors. In April he was appointed president and CEO, becoming the only Latino CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Gutierrez was also the youngest CEO in the company’s nearly 100-year history.\n\nIn 1999, Kellogg faced a global decline or stagnation in cereal sales. Gutierrez's strategy, known as \"Volume to Value,\" was to increase sales by focusing resources on higher-margin products. Higher-margin products targeted specific markets and included products such as Special K, Kashi, and Nutri-Grain bars. Extra income would fund advertising, promotions, and R&D, which would encourage further high-margin sales growth. \"Volume is a means to an end--not an end,\" he said. \"What counts is dollars.\"\n\nIn September 2004, Fortune Magazine dubbed Gutierrez as \"The Man Who Fixed Kellogg\", and attributed his success to \"taking the slick salesmanship, financial discipline, and marketing savvy that he learned in his youth and blending it with disarming charisma, steely resolve, and an utter lack of pretension that you wouldn't expect in one so nattily dressed.\" The magazine also added that, \"He even makes golf shirts look debonair.\"\n\nOn November 29, 2004, Gutierrez was chosen by President George W. Bush to become Secretary of Commerce, succeeding Donald Evans. On the same day, Kellogg's board of directors accepted Gutierrez's resignation as chairman of the board and CEO, to be effective upon his confirmation by the Senate and swearing-in. On January 24, 2005, Gutierrez was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate; he was sworn in on February 7, 2005.\n\nAs Secretary of Commerce, Gutierrez also served as co-chair of the U.S. Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba. Secretary Gutierrez was actively involved in U.S.-Cuba policy alongside Co-Chair Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nGutierrez was also one of the President’s point men working with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation, an issue he sees as one of the greatest domestic social issues of our time. He believes a successful immigration solution must focus first on securing our borders, but must also address immigrants' contribution to our economy and the importance of American unity.\n\nGutierrez played a key role in the passage of CAFTA-DR, a landmark trade agreement that expanded opportunities for U.S. exports throughout Latin America. Gutierrez was also instrumental in promoting the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. In 2006 Gutierrez called for Congress to “work with us and pass the pending Free Trade Agreements with Colombia, Korea and Panama, so we can have fair, two-way trade with our allies and friends.” He also led the first-ever domestic trade mission to the Gulf region in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nIn December 2007, Ken Silverstein, the Washington editor of Harper's Magazine, reported that Gutierrez had Adnan Oktar's \"Atlas of Creation\", a book that advocates Islamic creationism and blames Charles Darwin for modern terrorism, including the 9/11 attacks, for display on a stand at the entrance to his U.S. government office. Gutierrez's office did not respond when asked whether the book had been purchased or mailed unsolicited to his office.\n\nGutierrez was the founder and Chairman of Global Political Strategies (GPS), an international strategic consulting service and a division of APCO Worldwide, a Washington-based global communications firm.\n\nIn February 2009, Gutierrez was named a Scholar at the University of Miami’s Institute For Cuban And Cuban American Studies. In April 2009, he joined the university's board of trustees. He is also Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Meridian International Center, as well as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Bipartisan Debt Reduction Task Force.\n\nOn February 21, 2009, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported that Gutierrez remained unemployed, along with a significant majority of George W. Bush's 3,000 political appointees who were seeking full-time employment. According to the article, 25% to 30% of those officials had found new jobs, a statistic notably lower than when Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton left the White House. The article notes that \"at least half those presidents' senior staffers landed employment within a month after the administration ended.\" Gutierrez commented that, \"This is not a great time for anyone to be job hunting, including numerous former political appointees.\" He added that he hopes to run a company like Kellogg again because \"I have a lot of energy.\" However, according to a press release from United Technologies Corporation, Gutierrez joined the company's board of directors on February 9, several days prior to the publication of the \"Wall Street Journal\" article.\n\nAccording to press releases, Gutierrez also serves on the Board of Directors of Occidental Petroleum, GLW Corning, and Intelligent Global Pooling Systems. He is also a television news contributor for the business news television channel CNBC. In March 2010, Gutierrez said he would not like to return to a CEO spot at a foodmaker, because as commerce secretary, he had something different to do each day, whereas, \"Business is pretty one-dimensional.\"\n\nIn December 2010, Gutierrez became a vice chairman of Citigroup in the Institutional Clients Group and member of the Senior Strategic Advisory Group. He left the company in February 2013\n\nGutierrez served as a member of the Debt Reduction Task Force at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nIn 2012 Gutierrez lead the creation of the SuperPAC Republicans for Immigration Reform; he said he believed that \"the far right of this party has taken the party to a place that it doesn't belong\".\n\nIn 2013, Gutierrez was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. On October of that same year, Time Warner elected him to its board of directors.\n\nIn August 2016, Gutierrez endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, stating that Donald Trump's economic policies were a \"disaster\".\n\nGutierrez and his wife Edilia have one son, Carlos Jr., and two daughters, Erika and Karina.\n\nGutierrez was recently involved in a civil court case, filed against by a Lori Foster, a woman engaged for \"ghost write\" a biography on the former Secretary. However, Ms Foster alleges that Mr. Gutierrez failed to pay her for work performed.

He is a former member of the Group of 184. Baker was a candidate for president in Haiti's 2006 and 2010 elections.\n\nBaker was born in Port-au-Prince. His father Édouard Baker was a mulatto who was a prominent engineer, agronomist, well-known soccer player, and son of an Episcopalian missionary from England, who married an Afro-Haitian woman. His mother, Louise Barranco, was a businesswoman from a light-skinned mulatto elite family, who was the founder of the first supermarket chain in Haiti and whose father was a trader. Baker has two brothers and three sisters.\n\nAfter completing his elementary education in Haiti, he traveled to the United States. In 1972 he graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California. He later attended Saint Leo University in Florida, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration in 1976. In 1975, he married Marie Florence Apaid, sister of André Apaid. He has four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nBaker began his business career as a manager at the age 21 in his family-owned and operated supermarket chain. When his father became ill, he took over the family-owned 90-acre farm Habitation Dujour, which grew sugarcane, banana, and tobacco. Eventually, the land expanded another 120 acres which made it the largest flue-cured tobacco farm in Haiti, with more than 200 acres. Simultaneously, from 1982 to 1985 he worked with the tobacco growers of Haiti through the Comme il faut Company, where he held the position of Assistant to the Leaf Growing Manager.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, Baker purchased a garment factory, Pantalon Boucanier S.A.. This factory, which is monitored by Betterworks an affiliate of OIT, adheres to strict international standards. It employs hundreds of Haitians who are paid the minimum salary required by Haitian law. It has set up an incentive program which permits workers to make 50% more than the minimum salary while getting the 25% benefits required by Haitian law. Baker sells the garments produced in these factories to major corporations such as Walmart and K-Mart.\n\nIn 2000, he joined the Association des Industries d’Haïti as a member and a year later became its vice president.\n\nBaker was a prominent member of the Group of 184 (G 184), a coalition of Haitian organizations opposing Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The group's actions contributed to the US orchestrated coup d'état against Aristide in 2004.\n\nIn August 2005, Baker announced his intention to run for the president of Haiti in the elections originally planned for November 2005 but later moved to February 2006.\n\nBaker and his Respè coalition received 8.24 percent of the vote, losing to René Préval.\n\nCharles Henri Baker ran for President of Haiti in the November 28, 2010 Haiti elections, under the Respè Party of Haiti. Newspaper articles alleged that Baker tried to buy votes in the run-up to the elections.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "336179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336179", "title": "Charter", "text": "Charter\n\nA charter is the grant of authority or rights, stating that the granter formally recognizes the prerogative of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or sovereignty), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and that sense is retained in modern usage of the term.\n\nThe word entered the English language from the Old French \"charte\", via Latin \"charta\", and ultimately from Greek χάρτης (\"khartes\", meaning \"layer of papyrus\"). It has come to be synonymous with a document that sets out a grant of rights or privileges.\n\nThe term is used for a special case (or as an exception) to an institutional charter. A charter school, for example, is one that has different rules, regulations, and statutes from a state school.\n\nCharter is sometimes used as a synonym for \"tool\" or \"lease\", as in the \"charter\" of a bus or boat or plane by an organization, intended for a similar group destination.\n\nA charter member of an organization is an original member; that is, one who became a member when the organization received its charter.\n\nAnglo-Saxon charters are documents from the early medieval period in Britain which typically make a grant of land or record a privilege. They are usually written on parchment, in Latin but often with sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s; the oldest surviving charters granted land to the Church, but from the 8th century surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to lay people.\n\nThe British Empire used three main types of colonies as it sought to expand its territory to distant parts of the earth. These three types were royal colonies, proprietary colonies, and corporate colonies. A charter colony by definition is a \"colony chartered to an individual, trading company, etc., by the British crown.\" Although charter colonies were not the most prevalent of the three types of colonies in the British Empire, they were by no means insignificant.\n\nA congressional charter is a law passed by the United States Congress that states the mission, authority, and activities of a group. Congress issued federal charters from 1791 until 1992 under Title 36 of the United States Code.\n\nA municipal corporation is the legal term for a local governing body, including (but not necessarily limited to) cities, counties, towns, townships, charter townships, villages, and boroughs. Municipal incorporation occurs when such municipalities become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a municipal charter.\n\nCharters for chivalric orders and other orders, such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.\n\nIn project management, a project charter or project definition (sometimes called the terms of reference) is a statement of the scope, objectives and participants in a project. It provides a preliminary delineation of roles and responsibilities, outlines the project objectives, identifies the main stakeholders, and defines the authority of the project manager. It serves as a reference of authority for the future of the project.\n\nIn medieval Europe, royal charters were used to create cities (i.e., localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter was granted is considered to be when a city was \"founded\", regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled.\n\nAt one time a royal charter was the only way in which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for limited companies) are generally now used instead.\n\nA charter of \"Inspeximus\" (Latin, literally \"We have inspected\") is frequently a royal charter, by which an earlier charter or series of charters relating to a particular foundation (such as a monastery or a guild) was recited and incorporated into a new charter, usually in order to confirm and renew its validity under present authority. Where the original documents are lost, an inspeximus charter may sometimes preserve their texts and lists of witnesses.\n\n"}

{"id": "48823121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48823121", "title": "Configuration lifecycle management", "text": "Configuration lifecycle management\n\nConfiguration Lifecycle Management (CLM) is the management of all product configuration definitions and configurations across all involved business processes applied throughout the lifecycle of a product.\n\nThe development of the concept of CLM has been prompted by the proliferation of configuration capabilities in different enterprise systems and a subsequent need to establish a master system of records for product definition logic and configurations, especially for manufacturing companies that rely on business processes related to assemble-to-order or mass customization. CLM differs from other business disciplines as it focuses on cross functional use of information of configurable products. This entails that users of CLM include both back-office engineers, financial controllers among others, and marketing, sales and customers.\n\nSystems and technologies for defining and maintaining configuration definitions developed and matured during the 1990s and 2000s and are today established in three different main areas:\n\n\nThese definitions operate with different domains for configurations expressed in bill of materials adapted for different business purposes, typically E-BOMs in the PLM world, M-BOMs in the ERP world, pricing and sales-BOMs in CRM/CPQ and S-BOMs and procedures in SRM.\n\nThe Concept of Configuration Lifecycle Management (CLM) was introduced in 2012 by Joy Batchelor and Henrik Reif Andersen following TATA Motors’ acquisition of the automotive manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and JLR’s subsequent search for a future platform to handle configuration of vehicles throughout the enterprise.\n\nFollowing an evaluation and decision to deploy a new Enterprise Resource Planning system and a Product Lifecycle Management system, both of which have rule authoring and configuration capabilities each developed for different purposes, JLR saw an opportunity to introduce a new rule authoring and configuration management system to avoid unnecessary duplication of configuration activities and subsequent errors due to misaligned configuration rules.\n\nThe \"CLM Summit\" hosted by the company \"Configit\" for Automotive and Industrial Machinery in 2015 identified a general need to change the current disconnected way of defining product configuration logic and issued the so-called \"2015 CLM Declaration\" which is a non-scientific paper reflecting a common agreement of the summit participants on CLM.\n\nAccording to the CLM Declaration, CLM should address the following complex configuration challenges:\n\nWithout a CLM approach integrating configuration capabilities available in different enterprise systems is problematic due to the differences in configuration paradigms used to solve different types of specific configuration problems. When applying a CLM approach to this challenge a configuration management system that is agnostic to the format of rules from different systems interprets the outcome of these rules and translates, enriches and exports these rules to other systems in the organization.\n\nIn the automotive industry a practice has developed over the last 30 years in which aspects of vehicles are modelled using an abstract notion of a \"feature\". A feature is an abstraction used to represent an aspect of a product. It is identified by a feature code and an associated feature description. Features can be commercial features capturing an aspect of relevance to a customer, for instance, the color of the vehicle, whether it is a diesel or petrol engine and whether it has a manual or automatic gearbox. Features can also be technical features of relevance to manufacturing but less so for a customer. Examples are, the frequency to be used for keyless entry, the variant of the exhaust system needed for a particular configuration of the vehicle and the emission standard to be fulfilled by the vehicle.\n\nIn CLM features are used as an abstraction layer between the CLM-system and subscribing systems. A \"feature string\" is a valid (as determined by the definitions in the CLM system) complete or partial selection of features that define a product. The feature string acts as a product’s DNA that is shared by all subscribing systems and processes.\n\nAny CLM solution needs a powerful configuration engine to support creation and validation of feature strings. Historically, there are three generations of configuration engines:\n\n\nBehind the seemingly simple process of configuring and ordering a configurable product, such as a car, lie several business processes of which configuration is an essential part:\n\nWhen developing a new product that is designed to be customized, allowable variants and options must be defined.\n\nPricing of customizable products must account for market acceptability and costs based on calculations of all the possible configurations\n\nMarket demands and local regulation are expressed as rules enabling enterprises to meet demands in a global market\n\nCustomizing to the specific wants and needs of the individual customer resulting in a valid order to be fed into downstream systems\n\nParts and assemblies from sub-suppliers are sourced to fit in the sequence of the assembly line.\n\nThe configuration determines how the product is built. Invalid configurations can cause the production line to stop and erroneous products, placing a huge importance on eliminating errors before this phase.\n\nThe phase of the lifecycle known in e.g. Automotive as aftermarket. In CLM the configuration of the product is updated, elements and components are replaced in a way that ensures that these activities are compliant with the configuration.\n\nOnce the product has reached end of life and is to be disposed, depending on the materials used in the product, disposal requirements may apply. These requirements are usually reflected by laws (e.g. REACH). In order to enable disposal of the product in conformance to these disposal requirements, the composition of the product must be documented, available and up to date - i.e. the complete configuration lifecycle information must be available.\n\nWhen moving towards mass customization, almost every business process from development, manufacturing through to the delivery of configurable products needs to be adapted to ensure both accuracy and efficiency. The creation of configuration capabilities in today’s market means that configuration data is increasingly likely to be distributed across multiple applications throughout an enterprise system. CLM software supplies the needed functionality for a lifecycle approach to product configuration. \n\nCLM Summit is a forum established to further develop CLM as a discipline. The first Inaugural CLM Summit was held in September 2015 at Lake Lanier, Georgia with participants from various industrial and educational organizations. The direct outcome of this summit was the CLM declaration, co-authored and signed by participants of the summit.\nThe date for next CLM Summit is yet to be published at CLMSummit.com.\n\n"}

He is one of the great national benefactors of Greece. Born in the town of Metsovo (Epirus, Greece, then Ottoman Empire) Averoff moved to Alexandria while still young. He was known through most of his life for founding numerous schools in both Egypt and Greece.\n\nGeorge Averoff was of Aromanian-Greek origin. He moved to Cairo, Egypt, in 1837 to work in a shop run by his brother, Anastasios. Thanks to his bold tactics and business activities he became the biggest merchant in Egypt. At the same time he participated in banking and real estate (buying and leasing land) while, thanks to his many riverboats travelling up and down the Nile, he managed to dominate Egypt’s domestic and foreign trade. \n\nThe Greek historian Antonios Chaldeos, who has written his PhD thesis about the history of the Greeks in Sudan, suggests that based on local histories in Sudan that Averoff was heavily involved in slave-trade there. In fact, the Omdurman quarter of \"Abu Ruf\", where historically the slave-market was situated, is still today named after him. \n\nHis business activities resulted his accumulating vast wealth, which he used to donate to charity and common good purposes. His charity work included significant donations for the development of educational and other infrastructure projects for the Greek communities of Alexandria, Metsovo, Athens and for the Greek state in general. Among them, the most notable ones were the founding of the School of Agriculture in Larisa, the construction of the Evelpidon Military Academy, the donation to the Athens Conservatory, the donation for the refurbishment of the Panathenian Stadium (raised by another two Aromanian benefactors), where the first modern Olympic Games were held, the completion of the National Technical University of Athens and the donation for building of the namesake flagship of the Greek Navy.\n\nThe restoration of the Panathenian Stadium for the 1896 Summer Olympics was done at the request of Crown Prince Constantine. The stadium was refurbished in 1895, its second refurbishment in the 19th century, using white marble from Mount Penteli pursuant to Averoff's request. The cost was initially estimated at 585,000 drachmas but eventually reached 920,000 drachmas. Averoff also served as a member of the reception committee for the foreign competitors at the Games.\n\nAveroff died in Alexandria in 1899. In gratitude for his generous donations and services, the Greek state declared him a Major National Benefactor and commissioned a marble statue of him which was placed in front of the Panathenian Stadium. It remains there today. On 12 March 1910, the armoured cruiser flagship of the Hellenic Navy, \"RHNS Georgios Averof\", was named in his honour, thanks to a bequest of 300,000 GBP (2,500,000 Gold francs) left to the navy by the terms of his Will & Testament.\n\n\n\n"}

Schwarzenegger uses the book to describe her personal journey and encourage other young women to achieve confidence and a positive self-image. She had body-image issues between fourth and seventh grade, but now controls her physical and mental health with walking exercises and yoga.\n\nAfter graduating from college in 2012 and unsure of her next steps, Schwarzenegger sought career advice from a variety of people, including athletes, singers, entrepreneurs and actors. She compiled their wisdom into her second book— \"I Just Graduated . . . Now What?—\"which was released in 2014 as a \"survival guide\" for recent college grads.\n\nIn 2017, Schwarzenegger authored a children’s book, \"Maverick and Me\". The book tells the story of how Schwarzenegger rescued and subsequently adopted her dog, Maverick. Using her own experience as a \"foster fail\" (when a foster home turns into a \"furever\" home), the book touts the benefits of pet adoption and rescue.\n\nAs of July 2018, she is in a relationship with actor Chris Pratt.\n\nSchwarzenegger is an ASPCA Ambassador and supports the Best Friends Animal Society.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32764522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32764522", "title": "Liberty Accounts", "text": "Liberty Accounts\n\nLiberty Accounts is an integrated online accounting and payroll system designed specifically for small and medium enterprises in the UK. Also described as a software as a service or SaaS cloud computing application, Liberty is available to both business owners and accountants. For accountancy firms it is available as a co-branded solution, including the firm's own visual identity and availability form their website.\n\nA second-generation online accounting system, Liberty was developed by Athene Systems Limited, along with Neil Chadwick — former Marketing Director of Easycounting. According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), \"This independent technology company has been coming up with innovative software solutions for business processes since 1996. Members of the team have worked for American Express, Black & Decker and Ernst & Young, and they been involved in offering online accounting solutions to accountants since the earliest days of the market.\"\n\nAthene Systems Limited was founded in 1996 by Alan Wright and Paul Taylor, who realised the potential of the internet as a means of collaboration between accountants and their clients. Development work on Liberty Accounts started in 2001, with the initial launch in 2003. Neil Chadwick joined Alan and Paul in 2006.\n\nSince 2004/05 the system has linked directly to the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) portal for online filing of PAYE and P11D, as well as facilitating IR35 income and expense association with contracts and employees.\n\nIn 2009, Liberty Accounts was accredited by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).\n\nThe Liberty Accounts system uses industry standard Oracle and Java (programming language) technologies. It delivers HTML in a cross-platform web browser environment, hosted in the UK in a secure data centre.\n\nLiberty Accounts offers different levels of functionality, depending on the skills and training of the user – meaning that both accountants and their clients can work on the same records, at their own level. This allows for closer and more ongoing collaboration between accountants and client businesses. According to accountant Ray Backler, \"I work with my clients on a day-to-day basis using the online system and the current financial position of the business is always up-to-date, so it is obvious when additional work is required, and it's easy to make recommendations for additional revenue streams.\" \n\nAccountants can set up a separate area within Liberty Accounts where they are able to access to cross-client views and a range of reports, as well as highlight key tasks and event dates. \"Global account settings can be enforced (for P11D classification, NIC classification, default VAT rates, and nominal codes for export to statutory accounts packages) from this control area, and the system can be tailored with the help of pre-packaged ‘roles’. These help members of the firm to manage their work efficiently, and make it easy for firms to control (and restrict) the menu options and structure available to clients.\" \n\nSecure transmission of data for online transactions is via a Thawte SSL web server certificate. The visual treatment is similar to that found in the Windows environment, featuring a typical management snapshot, lists of outstanding sales and purchase invoices and the current bank balance. \"The Windows-style drop down menus mirror desktop accounting packages...Reports are generated as PDFs almost instantly and displayed automatically. The presentation of reports and the range of report options look very much like QuickBooks, so there's instant familiarity for most accountants.\" Transactions — such as invoices, bank entries or journals — can be posted singly or in batches. \"Liberty supports the use of foreign currencies for invoices and customer statements (and can automatically calculate and post exchange rate gains and losses) and as well as having built-in stock control and payroll, it is unusual in offering the tools required for P11D compliance (including section 336 claims)...It captures P11D-related information at a transaction level, pulls the figures together on screen and then produces an HMRC approved facsimile of the P11D form, for ‘one click’ electronic filing.\" \n\nLiberty was the first online accounting provider to offer VAT functionality, including transactions such as European Union acquisitions, and production of the European Community Sales List (form VAT 101). Standard and cash accounting VAT schemes are supported, as well as flat-rate VAT (calculated on a transaction basis). According to David Harbron at the Fenchurch Group of commercial and residential property development companies: \"When the UK VAT rate rose to 20% in the New Year, [I] knew that Liberty would immediately be updated to reflect the increase, and that the automatic invoices the Fenchurch Group had set up for its tenants would all go out with the correct VAT rate on.\" \n\nat the University of Leeds\n"}

His sister was married to PrinceTurki bin Abdul Aziz, one of the brothers of Saudi King Fahd al Saud.\n\nAl Fassi's notoriety stems largely from his 1978 purchase (for $2.4 million in cash) of the 38-room white-stucco Whittier Mansion on Sunset Blvd., Beverly Hills, which, soon after its acquisition, he had painted an unpopular shade of green. He further decorated the grounds of his new home by having the publicly visible statuary around the property painted in flesh tones, with pubic hair also colorfully painted, raising the ire of many of his neighbors. In 1979 the mansion was used as a filming location for \"The Jerk\" starring Steve Martin. Within two years of its purchase, just after midnight on 1/2/81, the house was completely destroyed by a fire which was set by individuals burglarizing the house. The crowd that gathered to watch the spectacular fire, was characterized by amazement at how the inside wood, under the copper roof installed by the so-called Sheik, did not allow the Beverly Hills Firefighters to enter from above. Afterward, when the fire was put down, the mansion was gutted. No one there cheered but may have been relieved that the awful edifice, which had exerted such a poor, kitch influence on the other owners of the nearby homes along Sunset Boulevard, was gone. Eventually in 2010, the home was replaced by two new homes, reflecting the other attractive homes in the area. which\n\nAl Fassi soon relocated to Miami, joining other members of the Saudi royal family already there, and already provoking notoriety with helicopter commuting and large and unusual charitable contributions. Among his exploits there were disputes over fencing he erected on city property, the hiring of city police officers to serve as security guards, a lawsuit from a contractor for unpaid bills, and a dust-up over a proposed Big Ben-style clock to be built on Star Island in Biscayne Bay.\n\nAl Fassi had mixed success as an animal lover; he was known to have adopted scores of stray cats, and to have purchased live birds, fish, and even lobsters in order to set them free, but he was also charged with animal cruelty when investigators from the Greater Miami Humane Society found evidence of neglect.\n\nIn 1991 Al Fassi was arrested in Jordan and hastily extradited to Saudi Arabia, where he was held without charges until his release to house arrest. His arrest stemmed from his having taken the side of Iraq in the Persian Gulf War. He made broadcasts from Baghdad denouncing Saudi Arabia for its participation in the war, for its human rights policies, and calling for democracy.\n\nAl Fassi died Dec. 24, 2002 in Cairo. According to Marvin Mitchelson, the divorce lawyer for his first wife, Sheika Dena al Fassi, he died of an infected hernia, and was survived by four grown children.\n\n"}

He is the founder of the Kennedy Forum, a former member of the President’s Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, and co-founder of One Mind.\n\nA member of the Kennedy family, he is the youngest son of the long-time Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy and is a nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy. At the time of his father's 2009 death, Patrick was the last remaining member of the Kennedy family to serve in an elective office in Washington. After he chose not to seek re-election in 2010 and left office the following year, it was the first time that there were no members of the Kennedy family holding office in the United States Congress or as President since 1947.\n\nPatrick Kennedy was born in Brighton, Massachusetts. He is the youngest of three children born to Senator Edward Moore Kennedy Sr. (1932–2009) and musician/socialite/former model Virginia Joan Kennedy, \"née\" Bennett (born 1936). His sister Kara (1960–2011) was a television and film producer, while his brother Ted Jr. (born 1961), is a lawyer and member of the Connecticut State Senate. Patrick was named after his paternal great-grandfather, businessman and politician P. J. Kennedy (1858–1929).\nKennedy graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, (1986) and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island, (1991).\n\nWhile a Junior at Providence College, Kennedy defeated five-term incumbent John F. Skeffington Jr. for the Democratic nomination in District 9. In 1988, Kennedy became the youngest member of the Kennedy family to hold elected office, when he won election to the Rhode Island House of Representatives at age 21. He served two terms in the House representing District 9 in Providence. He chose not to run for a third term and was succeeded by Anastasia P. Williams.\n\nIn 1994, Kennedy was elected as a Democrat to represent the 1st Congressional District of Rhode Island. He was re-elected seven times, serving from January 3, 1995, to January 3, 2011 (the 104th to 111th Congresses).\n\nIn the House, Kennedy served on the Armed Services and Natural Resources Committees before being appointed to the Appropriations Committee.\n\nKennedy was lead sponsor of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which passed on October 3, 2008.\n\nKennedy authored and co-sponsored the Positive Aging Act, the Foundations for Learning Act, which established a grant program to improve mental and emotional health for school children through screening and early intervention, the National Neurotechnology Initiative Act, Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act; the COMBAT PTSD Act; the Nurse-Family Partnership Act, the Alzheimer’s Treatment and Caregiver Support Act, and the Ready, Willing, and Able Act\n\nKennedy was among the founders of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus and the 21st Century Healthcare Caucus and served as vice chairman of the Native American Caucus.

He won the election, defeating Republican candidate Kevin Vigilante. Kennedy was one of four Democrats in the 1994 congressional elections to win a congressional seat that had previously been held by a Republican, while Republicans gained dozens of seats to take over the U.S. House. He was re-elected every two years from 1996 until 2008 and did not run for re-election in 2010.\n\nIn 2000, Kennedy considered running against Republican Lincoln Chafee in the U.S. Senate election in Rhode Island but instead chose to run for re-election. Kennedy had recently won appointment to the House Appropriations Committee, a high-profile assignment that caused him to pass up the Senate race. He again considered running against Chafee in 2006 but instead chose to run for re-election.\n\nKennedy did not run for re-election in 2010 and completed his final term in January 2011. He finished his 8th term at the completion of the 111th United States Congress.\n\nSince leaving Congress, Kennedy has written and spoken publicly about his long struggle with bipolar disorder and drug addiction and become a leading advocate for a stronger mental health care system in the United States.\n\nPartnering with Shari and Garen Staglin in 2011, Kennedy launched One Mind (formerly One Mind for Research) with the intention of promoting the study of brain diseases. One Mind supports better diagnostics and new therapies to advance neuroscience discovery and fills the gaps in research funding by disseminating donor-supported funds.\n\nKennedy founded The Kennedy Forum in 2013, a behavioral health nonprofit, of which he is CEO, with the mission of leading the national dialogue on transforming mental health and addiction care delivery by uniting mental health advocates, business leaders, and government agencies around a common set of principles, including full implementation of the Federal Parity Law. In 2018, \"Politico\" termed Kennedy \"the unlikely go-to player for companies seeking to benefit from the Trump administration’s multibillion-dollar response to the opioid crisis\". Kennedy sits on the boards of eight corporations involved with the government's response to the drug crisis. He \"holds an equity stake in the firms\" and \"collects director fees\" from the latter organizations, many of which \"stand to benefit from fresh efforts in Congress and the Trump administration to combat the opioid crisis\". As such, Kennedy lobbied \"former congressional colleagues to advocate for higher levels of spending\".\n\nIn 2015, he co-authored \"A Common Struggle: A Personal Journey Through the Past and Future of Mental Illness and Addiction\" detailing his journey through mental illness, addiction, and his ongoing political advocacy for federal legislation in support of mental health and addiction health care.\n\nIn 2016, Kennedy founded Advocates for Opioid Recovery together with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Van Jones, a former domestic policy adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nHe is also co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, established in 2013 with Kevin Sabet and David Frum, an anti-legalization group. Speaking in the context of California's Proposition 64, Kennedy argued the legalization movement was \"putting our children at risk\" and \"exposed children from communities of color to more racial discrimination than before.\"\n\nKennedy is a vocal advocate for health care reform. During his tenure in Congress, he joined with U.S. Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM) in introducing legislation that places mental illness under the umbrella of health insurance.\n\nHe was a chief sponsor of one of the major pieces of legislation of 2008, the Mental Health Parity Act, a bill requiring most group health plans to provide coverage for the treatment of mental illnesses which is no less restrictive than coverage provided for physical illnesses.\n\nHe was a strong proponent of adding a comprehensive prescription-drug benefit to the U.S. Medicare and consistently opposed attempts to privatize the Medicare program. Kennedy also made numerous speeches advocating the re-orientation of the U.S. health-care system to preventive care. He has received numerous awards for his health care advocacy, including the Lymphoma Research Foundation's Paul E. Tsongas Memorial Award as well as the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Congressional Honors Award. He also received the Society for Neuroscience — Public Service Award (2002), Eli Lilly and Company 2003 Helping Move Lives Forward Reintegration Award, American Psychoanalytic Association 2003 President's Award, American Psychiatric Association Alliance award (2003), and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance — Paul Wellstone Mental Health Award (2003).\n\nHe has also been awarded the National Recovery Champion Award, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Humanitarian Award, the American Psychiatric Association Patient Advocacy Award, the New York Academy of Science Breaking the Chains of Stigma Award, the Society for Neuroscience Public Service Award, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology Distinguished Service Award, the Clifford Beers Foundation Centennial Award, the Autism Society of America Congressional Leadership Award, the Epilepsy Foundation Public Service Award, and the NAMI Humanitarian of the Year Award.\n\nIn a March 7, 2008, speech to the Cleveland City Club, Kennedy acknowledged having bipolar disorder and being a recovering alcoholic. He and his siblings have legal custody of their mother, who has long struggled with alcoholism.\n\nKennedy was named to the Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis signed by Executive order on March 29, 2017. This commission serves the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nOn January 28, 2008, Kennedy joined his father in endorsing Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, stating that Obama was the \"perfect antidote to George Bush\". Prior to that, Kennedy had joined his first cousin Timothy Shriver in endorsing U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd from Connecticut.\n\nKennedy has acknowledged being treated for cocaine use during his teenage years, and admitted that he abused alcohol and other drugs while he was a student at Providence College. He sought treatment for an OxyContin addiction in 2006. Due to his experience with addiction, Kennedy advocates against the legalization of recreational marijuana, but supports its medicinal use.\n\nOn May 4, 2006, Kennedy crashed his automobile into a barricade on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., at 2:45 a.m. A United States Capitol Police official said the congressman had appeared intoxicated when he crashed his car. According to Kennedy, he was disoriented from the prescription medications Ambien and Phenergan. Anonymous sources are alleged to have seen Kennedy drinking at the nearby Hawk & Dove bar prior to the accident. Kennedy also stated to officers that he was \"late for a vote\". However, the last vote of the night had occurred almost six hours earlier. The standard field sobriety test was not administered, and Kennedy was driven home by an officer.\n\nOn May 5, 2006, Kennedy admitted publicly that he had an addiction to prescription medication and announced he would be readmitting himself to a drug-rehabilitation facility at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota where he had sought treatment for prior addictions. He has stated that he has no recollection of the car crash. On May 8, 2006, Kennedy got a show of support when he was endorsed by the Rhode Island Democratic Party. On June 5, 2006, Kennedy was released from drug rehabilitation.\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Kennedy made a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to a charge of driving under the influence of prescription drugs. He was sentenced to one-year probation and a fine of $350. Two of the three charges (reckless driving and failure to exhibit a driving permit) were dismissed. He was also ordered to attend a rehabilitation program that includes weekly urine tests, twice-weekly meetings with a probation officer, near-daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and a weekly meeting of recovering addicts.\n\nOn June 12, 2009, Kennedy announced that he had again entered rehab, for an indefinite time at an undisclosed facility. In a statement to the press, Kennedy said that his recovery is a \"life-long process\" and that he would do whatever it takes to preserve his health: \"I have decided to temporarily step away from my normal routine to ensure that I am being as vigilant as possible in my recovery\", Kennedy said.\n\nAs of 2018, Kennedy says that he has been sober for more than six years.\n\nHis father, Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, died on August 25, 2009. Patrick made a tearful eulogy at the funeral, saying that \"He [Ted] would be very proud to see you all out here today paying a final respect and tribute to his memory\". He further elaborated on his experiences with his father as a child, saying his father would stay at his bedside during his frequent bouts of ill health.\n\nWhen Kennedy decided not to run for reelection in 2010, he cited his decision on the fact that his life \"has taken a new direction\". Mark Weiner, a major Democratic party fundraiser in Rhode Island and one of Kennedy's top financial backers, said \"It's tough to get up and go to work every day when your partner is not there, I think he just had a broken heart after his father passed away.\"\n\nKennedy now resides in Brigantine, New Jersey. In March 2011 he announced his engagement to eighth-grade history teacher Amy Savell (born c. 1975 to Leni and Jerry Savell). Amy has a daughter, Harper Petitgout (born c. 2008), from her previous marriage to Mark Petitgout. Kennedy and Savell married on July 15, 2011, in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. Patrick and Amy have four children:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2585824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2585824", "title": "Post-capitalism", "text": "Post-capitalism\n\nPost-capitalism includes a number of proposals for a new economic system to replace capitalism, examine more advanced forms, or otherwise speculate on the fate of the current form of the social order. According to some classical Marxist and some social evolutionary theories, post-capitalist societies may come about as a result of spontaneous evolution as capitalism becomes obsolete. Others propose models to intentionally replace capitalism. The most notable among them are socialism and anarchism.\n\nIn 1993, Peter Drucker outlined a possible evolution of capitalistic society in his book \"Post-Capitalist Society\". The book stated that knowledge, rather than capital, land, or labor, is the new basis of wealth. The classes of a fully post-capitalist society are expected to be divided into knowledge workers or service workers, in contrast to the capitalists and proletarians of a capitalist society. In the book, Drucker estimated the transformation to post-capitalism would be completed in 2010–2020.\n\nDrucker also argued for rethinking the concept of intellectual property by creating a universal licensing system. Consumers would subscribe, for a cost and producers would assume that everything is reproduced and freely distributed through social networks.\n\nIn 2015, according to Paul Mason the rise of income inequality, repeating cycles of unemployment and inflation and capitalism’s contributions to global warming had led both economists and philosophers to begin seriously considering post-capitalistic societies. Post-capitalism is expected to arise with further advances in automation and information sharing – both of which cause production costs to approach zero.\n\nThe emergence of post-capitalist dynamics were made possible through three major changes that were brought by the evolution and increasing sophistication of information technology. A first driver is a new dynamic that information technology brought to the workplace. Through increased connectivity the reachability of employees was improved and the lines between working hours and free time became blurred. In addition to that, the technological era led to an abundance of information that is easily retainable for everyone. While some industries only continued to exist due to information scarcity and secrecy, the market became disrupted by the emergence of new competitors that were able to enter the market and benefit from large sources of publicly-available information. A result of this was the increase in acquisition activities since the early 2000s which tried to counter decreasing margins through consolidation and monopoly building. A third dynamic that emerged from new technology was crowd-funding and crowd-sourcing. Crowd-funding led to a new option for corporate finance, which was often achieved for socially-accepted innovations. Crowd-sourcing on the other hand challenged the traditional employee-employer relationship under capitalism as people started to voluntarily contribute to product developments with a distinctive skill, such as programming or designing. A major reward for people engaged in crowd-sourcing is not monetary compensation, but the intrinsic reward of having a stake in an active development.\n\nSocialism often implies public ownership of companies and a planned economy, though it is argued whether either are essential features. In his book \"\", Paul Mason argues that centralized planning, even with the advanced technology of today, is unachievable. Alternatively, Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel argue that central planning is key to creating a participatory economy.\n\nFor post-capitalism to come from a socialist standpoint, a political and cultural transformation would need to occur alongside the economic transformation.\n\nAs Robin Hahnel states: \n\nHelpful definitions involving socialism:\n\nIn his book \"Of the People, By the People: The Case for a Participatory Economy\", Robin Hahnel describes a post-capitalist economy called the participatory economy. The book ends with the proposal of the Green New Deal, a package of policies that address climate change and financial crises.\n\nThe participatory economy focuses on the participation of all citizens through the creation of worker councils and consumer councils. Hahnel emphasizes the direct participation of worker and consumers rather than appointing representatives. The councils are concerned with large-scale issues of production and consumption and are broken into various bodies tasked with researching future development projects.\n\nIn a participatory economy, economic rewards would be offered according to need, the amount of which would be determined democratically by the workers council. Hahnel also calls for \"economic justice\" by rewarding people for their effort and diligence rather than accomplishments or prior ownership. A worker’s effort is to be determined by their co-workers. Consumption rights are then rewarded according to the effort ratings. The worker has the choice to decide what they consume using their consumption rights. Hahnel does not address the idea of money, currency, or how consumption rights would be tracked.\n\nPlanning in a participatory economy is done through the councils. The process is horizontal across the committees as opposed to vertical. All council members, the workers and consumers, participate directly in planning unlike in Soviet-type economies and other democratic planning proposals in which planning is done by representatives. Planning is an iterative procedure, always being changed and improved upon, that is accomplished at the level of either work or consumption. All information and proposals are freely available to everyone, those inside and outside of the council, so that the social cost of each proposal can be determined and voted on. Long-term plans such as structuring public transportation, residential zones and recreational areas, are to be proposed by delegates and approved by direct democracy (i.e. voting by the population).\n\nHahnel argues that a participatory economy will return empathy to our purchasing choices. Capitalism removes the knowledge of how and by whom a product was made: \"When we eat a salad the market systematically deletes information about the migrant workers who picked it\". By removing the human element from goods, consumers only consider their own satisfaction and need when consuming products. Introducing worker and consumer councils would reintroduce the knowledge of where, how and by whom products were manufactured. A participatory economy is expected to also introduce more socially oriented goods, such as parks, clean air, and public health care, through the interaction of the two councils.\n\nFor those that call the participatory economy utopian, Albert and Hahnel counter: \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31620642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31620642", "title": "Rolf W. Schnyder", "text": "Rolf W. Schnyder\n\nRolf W. Schnyder (1935 in Zurich – 2011 in Kuala Lumpur) was a Swiss businessman known for his role as the owner and CEO of watchmaker Ulysse Nardin.\n\nFrom the beginning a certain duality inhabited Rolf Schnyder's personality. On one side, his strong organizational skills and sharp analytical mind were typical of a Swiss German upbringing. However, there was also something unerringly romantic, a perpetual inquisitiveness and interest in the world beyond his immediate vicinity.\n\nIn 1956, Schnyder moved to Geneva to improve his French. Working in Jaeger-LeCoultre's advertising department on Geneva's historic Tour de L'Ile, Schnyder noticed that people in his office were easily intimidated by orders and correspondence that arrived in English. Realizing the insularity of the Swiss watch industry, Schnyder became determined to explore the world. He arranged to be posted for six months to his company's subsidiary, ‘De Travers' located on Cromwell Road in London. After this attachment he returned to Geneva, but somehow having been exposed to the sprawling universe beyond Switzerland he realized that he had to move again.\n\nLike many young men, Schnyder was infected with wanderlust; he wanted to dive into the rich vivid colors of foreign lands, to eat things with flavors he'd never tasted and to experience new cultures with total immediacy. A newspaper clipping aroused his attention. A Swiss company named Diethelm was distributing a vast array of goods in Thailand and they were searching for a Swiss junior manager. Though only 22 years old, Schnyder instantly responded to the ad and his application was accepted. As he boarded in Genoa the “Asia”, a ship bound for South East Asia, he felt the world opening its infinite golden mysteries to him.\n\nBecause of his experience in the Swiss watch industry, Schnyder was immediately put in charge of Diethelm's timepiece division. Schnyder and his sales team would embark on weeklong journeys throughout Thailand trumpeting the merits of Swiss watches. Thus, while the foreign nationals gathered together to eat vague approximations of European fare in their hotels, Schnyder was at street-side restaurants learning the culture and language of his Thai friends. Schnyder's ability to remain objective and not cast a Eurocentric sense of judgment on native behavior allowed him to understand and embrace the culture of the Thai people. Lean and rangy with the rawboned good looks of an American cowboy or a professional skier, Schnyder made friends easily. He began to look forward to these sales trips, as each one offered the opportunity to learn something new about the mysterious country he now inhabited.\n\nSchnyder also had an inborn sense of business acumen. This, combined with fine managerial skills and boundless energy, soon saw him multi-tasking. When Diethelm diversified its activities with a travel agency, Schnyder ended up running the operation. Eager to share his passion for the incredible sights of South East Asia, he initiated charter flights in a leased DC3 from Bangkok to Siem Riep where the ancient Buddhist city of Angkor Wat stood untouched by time.\n\nIn 1959 he and his friends took the historic trip down the River Kwai. They made their way through the thick forest from Kanchanaburi, a small town northwest of Bangkok, to the Burmese border. They lashed together a raft from bamboo poles with the help of a local who had plied through the forest to reclaim rails from the death railway built by Allied war prisoners during the Second World War, a task made famous by the movie, “The Bridge on the River Kwai”. From the source of the River Kwai they floated down the river on a handmade raft, capsizing at times on unexpected steep rapids. It was supposed to be a seven-day adventure trip. No one had any idea where exactly they were and how many more days were needed to get back to the office. Being late or absent was a serious offense in a tightly run Swiss office. They got finally back five days late and paid the price – a cut in holidays and bonuses. An image that Rolf Schnyder took during this adventure appeared on the cover of the Swiss magazine, Schweizer Illustrierte. An account of this trip, penned by Schnyder, could be found within its pages. It was the first of many travel reports published in Swiss and other European papers and magazines. In the next few years, Schnyder continued to explore Thailand, Laos, Bali, Cambodia and South Vietnam, where the war had just started.\n\nHe also developed a particular fondness for the white beaches around the fishing village of Pattaya which had not yet become part of the tourist track. He invested his first savings in the Nippa Lodge, Pattaya's very first hotel.\n\nAdvancing up the chain of command at Diethelm, Schnyder soon found himself in charge of the consumer products division. He was tasked with the distribution of basic goods from companies such as Procter and Gamble and Union Carbide. Ever the keen businessman, he soon realized that it would be more profitable to switch from imports to local manufacture under licence. This time it was his turn to share his culture — he imparted to his factory workers a Swiss sense of education, supervision and the institution of quality control. Schnyder recalls: “I was impressed with how fast the Thai people could learn new skills and how enthusiastic they were about their work. I could also see, in the way that they worked, that there was a high level of manual skill.”\n\nSchnyder also played rugby for the Royal Bangkok Sports Club. During this period, Schnyder learned to run large-scale operations. His boundless energy and his ability to be involved in almost every aspect at the factories as well as his uncanny ability with Thai language abetted his success.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1968, Schnyder switched gears. He left Thailand for a six-month voyage through the South Sea, sailing from Fiji to Samoa and around the islands of Tahiti and Bora Bora, visited South America and ended up in the head office of Philip Morris in New York where he got an assignment to develop the lucrative cigarette markets of South East Asia. Schnyder returned to Asia, basing himself in Hong Kong during the height of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. He applied for a visa to China to record with camera in hand the historical events that took place in the Empire of the Middle Kingdom. Westerners were not particularly welcome at the time. Having a neutral Swiss passport helped. Schnyder practiced reading verses of the Red Book but still got in trouble. On the last day in Guangzhou he was offered some antique gold carvings which Chinese no longer had the right to possess as they had been declared capitalist merchandise. Since no taxis were available, two hotel waiters offered their help to carry these artifacts to the railway station for the trip back to Hong Kong. On the way, the group was stopped by some Red Guards who were omnipresent in town and countryside. They objected to the fact that a Chinese carried goods for a white foreigner. The two waiters had to drop Schnyder's bags instantly and were sent home. Schnyder had to drop his travel bags as well, was taken to a building occupied by the Red Guards and made to quote verses from the Red Book backward and forward all night long. Only next morning was he released, given some tea and a bowl of rice and sent back to the street corner where the bags had been dropped by the waiters and himself the evening before. Nobody had touched them. It took Schnyder two trips on foot of 30 minutes each to get all his luggage to the railway station. He reached the Lo Wu bridge, the border between China and the then- British colony of Hong Kong, one day behind schedule. Nevertheless, Schnyder was met by a large group of journalists who were eager to buy the many photos which he had shot during the previous five days and which were later published in newspapers around the globe and in the important US magazine, “Life”.\n\nSchnyder's job with Philip Morris took him around the world and also back to the Philip Morris European headquarters in Switzerland, where he met Charles and Marcel Stern, the cousins of Philippe Stern, president of Patek Philippe. The cousins' owned one of the best watch dial factories in Switzerland and they invited Schnyder for a guided tour.\n\nAs Schnyder watched dials materialize in the skilled hands of factory workers, a blue flash of inspiration blazed through him. He was absolutely certain that Thai workers could learn the trade of dial-making given the opportunity. The vastly lower cost of human labor in the Far East meant that Schnyder could craft watch dials of similar quality at a far lower price per unit which would permit the Swiss watch industry to stay competitive against the lower-priced products emerging from the Japan's Seiko. Charles and Marcel Stern were immediately sold on the idea, but the rigid Swiss syndicate that presided over the Swiss dial manufacturers was more difficult to convince. Finally, in 1968 Schnyder helped forge a joint partnership between Swiss and Asian investors to open the Cosmo dial and watchcase factory in Thailand. Schnyder immediately quit his job with Philip Morris and took the helm of this new enterprise.\n\nBusiness boomed from the onset with Schnyder and the Cosmo team filling big orders from many Swiss watch companies like Mido, Certina, Rado, Tissot, Camy, Fortis and many others. Eventually even the iconic Swiss brand Omega was unable to disregard the tremendous savings offered. However, as business soared a fractured relationship erupted among the investors. Tiring of the politics involved, Schnyder sold his shares in Cosmo and moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1973.\n\nThe Precima factory, which became a key player in manufacturing watch accessories for Swiss watch companies, opened that same year. Aided by a 10- year tax-exempt grace period that allowed Schnyder to import materials tax free, business literally skyrocketed. Schnyder's trajectory of success soared. Soon he diversified to craft other micro-components, including balance springs and sapphire crystals. Business was growing at such a fast rate that Schnyder had to set up offices in Switzerland. These were located in the ASUAG building in the Seevorstadt neighborhood near Bienne. ASUAG owned several watch companies like Longines, Rado and Eterna, and key movement suppliers including ETA.\n\nIt was at this location that Schnyder met Pierre Renggli, the general manager of ASUAG, and, through him, Ernst Thomke, who headed ETA. Thomke was fascinated by the opportunities that Schnyder had created in the Far East and assisted in transferring part of the quartz module production to Precima.\n\nIn the winter of 1983 Schnyder found his calling, to restore one of the greatest names in high-end watchmaking to its former glory. Why buy a manufacture focused on making mechanical watches at a time when everyone told him this industry was dead? The answer to this question comes from the time Schnyder spent in Asia.\n\n“In China and India, quartz watches were not successful,” relates Schnyder. “That is because watch repairmen would open the case backs and, for them, it was like looking into the back of a radio. In these cultures, the mechanical watch had residual value. Any competent repairman could open a watch up and service or fix it. They could see where the energy came from, they could identify with the mechanical movement. When I saw that these cultures adamantly refused at that time to embrace quartz watches, I knew that one day mechanical watches would come back.\n\n“It is often said, but it is true, that the watch is a man's only piece of jewelry. This personal relationship becomes even stronger when the watch is mechanical. There is a beautiful symbiosis between a man and his mechanical watch. He gives the watch life by winding it and the watch unerringly serves him by providing him time. An almost fierce loyalty develops between a man and his watch.”\n\nIn 1983, at 48 years of age, Schnyder returned to St. Moritz, Switzerland to ski and race his beloved skeleton bobsleds, activities that he continues to enjoy today. (He still occasionally wins a race on the Cresta Run, as he did in February 2006.)\n\n“I was on holiday skiing when I read in the papers that Ulysse Nardin had filed for Chapter 11 (deferment of payment) to protect itself from creditors. This was during the Quartz Crisis and many famous companies in Switzerland were folding. Ulysse Nardin had many debts without any real way of paying them off,” says Schnyder. He, like many watch enthusiasts, knew Ulysse Nardin's name well. “I knew of the brand because of the many medals for accuracy and chronometric competitions that it had won. I was immediately interested in purchasing Ulysse Nardin. It was the opportunity to be involved in one of the truly great names in horology.”\n\nHowever, when Schnyder visited the manufacture, he discovered nothing more than a beautiful carcass housed in the original factory building that was constructed in 1864. There was only one full-time watchmaker named Leopold Berthoud who occupied himself by creating Ulysse Nardin's marine chronometers and deck watches for collectors looking to own an anachronistic but sublimely made piece of naval history. Another person that Schnyder found at the manufacture was Jean-Jacques Haldimann. “It was essentially with these one-and-a-half employees (as Haldimann was not actually on company payroll at that time) that I started at Ulysse Nardin. I realized that if I were to undertake this resurrection, I would have to breathe life back into this carcass based on the strength of our products,” says Schnyder.\n\nHis plan for Ulysse Nardin's rebirth was to elevate it to the highest position in watchmaking. “To do this, I knew I had to make a watch that had never been made before,” he explains. Fortunately for Schnyder, the ever-helpful Haldimann was deeply embedded in the Swiss watch industry. He told Schnyder that an independent watchmaker named Jörg Spoering had created a new tourbillon. Rolf was keen to see if Spoering had other ideas for high complications. As soon as he entered Spoering's atelier in Lucerne, a bizarre clock caught his eye. Says Schnyder: “I had only a vague recollection of seeing something like it before, so I asked: ‘Is this what they call an astrolabium?' Spoering said it was and explained that the clock was made by someone named Ludwig Oechslin. He sighed and added: ‘He is supposed to be my apprentice but he is never here.'”\nThree weeks later Spoering arranged for Schnyder to meet Oechslin. “I pointed to the Astrolabium clock and asked: ‘Can you make it in wristwatch size?' He puzzled for a moment and answered, genuinely confused: ‘I can, but who would want it so small.'” Rolf Schnyder smiled as he replied: “I do.”\n\nUnveiled in 1985, the Astrolabium Galileo Galilei was a major critical and commercial success. Although the Astrolabium went down in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most complex watch made, its significance was far greater than the sum of its parts. The Astrolabium, a machine powered by human kinetic energy that told time through the ancient poetry of celestial positions, was a sign of things to come and marked “the beginning of a beautiful friendship” between the brilliant leader Schnyder and the poet-philosopher Oechslin. Together, what they would accomplish over the next two-and-a-half decades is, in a word, ‘extraordinary'.\n\nDuring his years at the helm of Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder has created some of the most original and functionally innovative timepieces in horology. Rather than sticking to ‘tried-and-tested', Ulysse Nardin with the help of Ludwig Oechslin has constantly pushed the boundaries and opened up new worlds of manufacturing techniques and materials ahead of the rest of the watch industry. Ludwig's creative mind worked much faster than the small production team at the disposal of Schnyder. Schnyder followed up his awesome Astrolabium watch with the Planetarium Copernicus, a wristwatch that represents time through the shifting position of the planets in our solar system. In 1989 Ulysse Nardin, in cooperation with Christophe Claret, brought the world the first repeating wristwatch with Jaquemarts. Tiny figures carved in gold move on the dial synchronized in time to the repeater's hammer strikes.\n\nIn 1992 the manufacture completed the ‘Trilogy of Time' with the Tellurium Johannes Kepler, a watch that tells time using a stunning interpretation of our constantlyrotating planet. In 1993 Schnyder unveiled the Hourstriker San Marco, the fruit of his collaboration with technical wunderkind Giulio Papi. In 1994 Ulysse Nardin shifted gears and focused on the creation of the world's most functional GMT watch. The GMT ±'s ease of use and pure simple logic has been a revelation to frequent travelers.\n\nThen in 1996, on the 150th anniversary of his manufacture, Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin raised the curtain on the world's most purely functional perpetual calendar. This amazing timepiece has all calendar displays synchronized and adjustable through a single crown. Because of its reliance on special epicyclical gearwheels rather than levers, this incredible watch can be quickly adjusted both forwards and backwards! In 1999 the perpetual calendar received the added GMT ± indicator. Incredibly, all calendar displays were synchronized to this local time indicator. To this day, Ulysse Nardin's perpetual calendars represent the high reference in watchmaking for this complication, a remarkable benchmark that has never been surpassed.\n\nOn the first year of the new millennium, Rolf Schnyder and Ludwig Oechslin created a wristwatch that was irrevocably to change the face of modern horology. Their audacious Freak, a 7-day carrousel tourbillon with no hands or crown, is the world's first example of horological modern art. With its purity of design involving a movement that also gives indications of time, it still stands as the most creative innovation of the 21st century watch world. The Freak single-handedly smashed every convention known to haut de gamme watchmaking and opened the floodgates of creativity. As if this isn't enough, beating within it is the Dual Direct escapement, the first successful implementation of a non-lubricated alternative to the Swiss lever escapement. The Dual Direct escapement's wheels were made in silicium, another historical first in watchmaking history.\n\nIn 2002, Schnyder launched the Genghis Khan, the world's first carillon Westminster minute repeater tourbillon with Jaquemarts. In the same year, the Freak won the Watch of the Year award. In 2003, Schnyder and Oechslin once again conspired to change the face of watchmaking with their Sonata, the world's first alarm watch that could be set 24 hours in advance and had a dual time function. Ulysse Nardin in cooperation with GFD developed the first hairspring for the balance wheel in polycrystalline diamond.\n\nIn 2005, Ulysse Nardin created an updated version of the Freak, the Freak 28'800 V/h utilizing an updated and improved version of the Dual Direct escapement called the Dual Ulysse escapement. Schnyder also introduced the word's first watch to use diamond micro-components in its escapement, the Freak Diamond Heart.\n\nIn 2006, to celebrate the 160th anniversary of the manufacture he has so assuredly led for the last 23 years, Schnyder presents the Caliber 160, Ulysse Nardin's first completely in-house designed and executed automatic caliber. This caliber features the manufacture's Dual Ulysse escapement at its heart. Innovative design allows the plate of the movement to be customized to integrate other signature complications of Ulysse Nardin, creating integrated movements rather than the modular movements that currently dominate the high watchmaking world.\n\nWhen Schnyder first took the reins of Ulysse Nardin, he inherited the original, then-empty factory first built in 1864 and enlarged in 1895. Today, there are 250 inspired workers and staff at Ulysse Nardin. Moreover, each of these men and women exude a palpable sense of pride that is a singular phenomenon in Swiss watchmaking. With each success, Schnyder has focused on selfinvesting in his manufacture to create greater self-reliance and independence. The living testament to this is a huge two-storey factory plus basement located in La Chaux-de- Fonds. Opened in 2003, this factory of dreams represents the way forward and assures the enduring viable future of one of Swiss watchmaking's greatest names. This production facility, watched over by Ulysse Nardin's immensely capable technical director Pierre Gygax and chief engineer Lucas Humair, offers the manufacture great flexibility in the creation of new products. It also offers Schnyder and his team the psychological comfort of knowing that under this roof they are capable of producing almost anything necessary to the ticking entity known as the mechanical wristwatch.\n\nWith his boundless enthusiasm, clarity of vision and the conviction to constantly raise the bar in the industry, Schnyder has done what many didn't feel was possible when he first purchased Ulysse Nardin. Not only did he rescue the manufacture and return it to its former place of glory, but on the strength of his innovations he has enabled Ulysse Nardin to transcend its past and achieve an even higher place in the rarified constellation of watchmaking's legends. In his 23 years at the helm of Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder's personality and that of the manufacture have merged. They have become one. The spirit of the watchmaker Ulysse Nardin has reached out over the great ocean of time to become inextricably intertwined with Schnyder's own great warrior spirit, a spirit that can at once wholeheartedly plunge into the humor of life while taking on and out-swimming life's perilous currents. In the years he has led Ulysse Nardin, Schnyder has fulfilled his fate.\n\nSchnyder often shuttled between Switzerland and Malaysia. When he was not overseeing business in Le Locle, he was either at his home in Kuala Lumpur or visiting subsidiaries and retailers around the world. Schnyder shared a tropical home with his wife, and they are the parents of three children.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to watchmaking, Schnyder was awarded the \"Spirit of Enterprise\" Gaia Award in 2003 by the Musee International d'Horlogerie for his entrepreneurial achievements and commitments.

{"id": "23464409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23464409", "title": "Service voucher", "text": "Service voucher\n\nA service voucher is a financial instrument which allows a public authority to target social services at those it deems in need, and at the same time to promote employment and labour market integration. It effectively boosts demand for certain services which meet social policy objectives.\n\nA voucher scheme will typically start by defining services which are needed in society, but which are being supplied neither by the market nor by the public sector. These might include for example home care, household repairs, ironing, or bicycle hire and repair. The activities within the scheme will typically be agreed with trade unions and employers' organisations, to avoid concern about the disturbance of unfair competition.\n\nPotential providers of these services are identified, often from among the long-term unemployed.\n\nVouchers are sold to people who want to use the service. The price is subsidised, so that on the one hand the service is affordable - and for instance can compete with informal (illegal) work - and on the other provides decent condition working for the employees (including social insurance cover, holiday pay etc.). An example of this kind of subsidy regime can be found in Belgium, where service vouchers for house cleaning, laundry, ironing, sewing, cooking, running errands, and transport for people with reduced mobility are sold to people who require these services. Each person residing in Belgium with a National Register Number is entitled to a quota of 500 service vouchers a year, with the first 400 service vouchers sold at a rate of 9 EUR each, and remaining 100 service vouchers sold at a rate of 10 EUR. In addition, each household has a quota of maximum 1000 service vouchers, with exceptions given to single parents and people with disabilities, who may be entitled to 2000 service vouchers, depending on the circumstances. Mothers with their own business who have just given birth are also entitled to 105 extra service vouchers. This initiative was made in order to combat the black market and has resulted in the creation of many jobs. This subsidy scheme allows for domestic workers to be declared and benefit from a legal salary, health insurance, paid holidays, and a pension; benefits that were not all possible when working on the black market. For each service voucher, a domestic servant receives a salary of 22.69 EUR, paid by both the customer and the state. In addition, tax breaks are also given to the first 156 service vouchers purchased yearly, creating another incentive to purchase these services. Similar systems exists in France and in Sweden.\n\nVouchers can be defined as subsidies granting limited purchasing power to an individual to choose among a restricted set of services. In the field of personal and household services, their use has been growing in recent years, following successful experiences in some European countries. Vouchers can be seen as tools that would lie between in kind provision of services and cash distribution of income to be used (or not) for these services. Very basically, vouchers are simple means of payment. The payment can be integrally made by the user, or by a public financer, and mixed forms of payment with other actors can be imagined (e.g. companies paying for part of the cost or insurance companies providing some services through this means).\n\nIn the field of care policies, the increasing use of vouchers has sometimes been analysed as an element of a current commodification trend that corresponds to an increase in what can be labelled a “social market” logic. Social markets mainly rely on demand-side measures, the aim being to ensure that users or consumers of services are offered more choice and are, financially speaking, able to purchase personal services. The market logic involves developing the demand side with the aim of transforming “latent” demand into effective demand. These social markets thus involve competition between different modes of provision, with the user receiving direct or indirect assistance from public authorities to make their choice.\n\nIn the field of “non-care” services, vouchers are being used mostly for the same reasons as those in the care sector, that is for a series of supposed advantages in particular regarding efficiency of public spending, expected impact on undeclared labour but also quality issues (quality of services and quality of jobs). \n\n\nBelgium's service voucher sites per region:\n\nFlanders: http://www.dienstencheques-vlaanderen.be/\n\nBrussels: http://dienstencheque.brussels/\n\nWallonia: http://www.wallonie-titres-services.be/\n\n\"The Service Voucher in Belgium\", paper to EU mutual learning seminar, 26–27 October 2006\n\n\"Service vouchers - a family of instruments for employment\", Jean-François Lebrun, European Commission, 17 October 1996\n"}

In 1976 at age 38, he was appointed president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Bendix Corporation. From 1988 to 1995, Agee was the chairman, president, and CEO of Morrison-Knudsen.\n\nAgee was a business consultant, venture capitalist, and chairman of a charitable foundation. He received six honorary doctorate degrees and sat on the boards of Fortune 500 corporations including Equitable Life and Dow Jones as well as Bendix and Morrison Knudsen. In 1979, Agee was featured in a \"Time\" magazine cover story titled \"Faces of the Future\", and was named \"Finance\" magazine's \"Financial Man of the Year\" in 1976.\n\nBorn as William McReynolds Agee in Boise, Idaho, he was the middle child (and only son) of Harold J. and Suzanne (McReynolds) Agee. Harold, the son of a Baptist minister, had varied careers: manufacturing executive, dairy farmer, and state legislator.\n\nHarold moved the family to a dairy farm in nearby Meridian in 1953, and Bill transferred to Meridian High at age 15. He quickly established himself as a bright and popular student with leadership skills. Agee was elected class president in that first year as a sophomore and again in his senior year. He was a multi-sport varsity athlete and was named one of the two most studious members of his class, which graduated in 1956.\n\nAfter graduation from Meridian High School in 1956, in Agee attended Stanford University for one year before dropping out. He enrolled in the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he joined the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, unusual for a married man. He earned an associate's degree while working 40 hours per week in Albertson's accounting department. Agee was elected senior class president and graduated with highest honors in 1960.\n\nDuring the summer of 1959, Agee, along with his parents, played the part of the Dixon family in the ephemeral film \"Last Clear Chance\". Following graduation, Agee worked for the Title Insurance Company in Boise. He was promoted to controller and senior escrow officer at the age of 23. Agee enrolled in the Harvard Business School in 1961 and was awarded a Masters in Business Administration (MBA), with distinction, in 1963. He became a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in 1964 and joined the American and Idaho societies of CPAs.\n\nAgee was hired by Boise Cascade Corporation at age 25. Starting as Executive Assistant to CEO Bob Hansberger, Agee was appointed Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in 1969 at age 31, and Senior Vice President in 1971. Boise Cascade's stock price rapidly rose to $77 in 1969, then fell to $15 in the fall of 1971. \nAfter nine years, he left Boise in late May 1972, and the stock price was around $14.\n\nAgee joined Bendix Corporation, an automobile industry related manufacturer located near Detroit, Michigan, in May 1972. He had been recruited for the post by Bendix's then-CEO, Michael Blumenthal. Agee became CFO and Executive Vice President, and held a seat on the Board of Directors. He was elected President of the company in December 1976 at the age of 38, and was elevated to CEO a few weeks later when Blumenthal left Bendix to become the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in the new Carter Administration.\n\nAgee was recognized in \"Time\" magazine for his strategy of bold, selective acquisitions aimed at transforming Bendix from a slow-growth manufacturing company in a mature industry, into a diversified high-tech corporation. Agee's strategy dramatically increased the stock value of Bendix during Agee's tenure despite a recession that afflicted two of its traditionally main businesses, automobile parts and machine tools. While competitors floundered in 1981, Bendix' profits increased 136% and its fiscal year revenues rose to $4.4 billion.\n\nAgee was an unorthodox executive for the 1970s, often dressing in business casual attire years before it was in vogue. He removed the traditional boardroom table, replacing it with large, comfortable chairs to improve communication. He abolished reserved parking for top executives, allowing the best parking spots to go to employees who arrived at the office the earliest.\n\nHe was known for promoting young employees based upon merit rather than seniority. This practice caused a flurry of media interest in 1980 when he promoted 28-year-old Mary Cunningham, who had been his executive assistant, to the position of vice president for corporate communications and then VP for Strategic Planning. A nationally publicized account of an alleged office romance between Agee and Cunningham – which both denied – led to Cunningham’s resignation in October 1980 when she felt she could no longer effectively do her job. Both Agee and Cunningham divorced their spouses and married in June 1982.\n\nAgee sought to expand Bendix by launching a takeover bid for rival Martin Marietta. On August 25, 1982, Bendix announced it had purchased 1.6 million shares of Martin Marietta for $40 million. Martin Marietta fought the hostile takeover by attempting to acquire Bendix, employing the Pac-Man defense, in which a company that is threatened with a takeover, attempts to turn the tables by acquiring its would-be buyer. At one point, Bendix owned a majority of Martin Marietta shares, while Martin Marietta, in turn owned a majority of Bendix shares. Neither Agee nor Marietta President Thomas Pownall would concede defeat, with Pownall refusing even to meet with Agee. When Marietta enlisted the help of a third company, United Technologies, Agee sought a partner to fend off the threatened takeover of Bendix. Agee eventually found Edward Hennessy of Allied Corp., who offered a way out of the stand-off: Allied would take possession of Marietta's shares of Bendix in exchange for the return of Bendix's Marietta holdings. In effect, Martin Marietta would remain an independent company while Bendix would become a subsidiary of Allied. Agee resigned from Bendix following the merger.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1995 Agee was Chairman, President and CEO of the construction company, Morrison Knudsen Corporation (MK) in his hometown of Boise. He had served on MK's Board of Directors for several years, and was the Board's choice to step in as CEO and President. At that time, a hostile takeover attempt by Chicago businessman Edward Heil and record losses threatened the company’s existence. Agee thwarted the takeover and returned the failing Morrison Knudsen to profitability within one year. By 1990, Agee had made the company highly profitable and it was debt-free. Agee employed a diversification strategy which changed the company from one which was primarily reliant on heavy construction to one which was involved in railroad remanufacturing, precious minerals, and the transit business. Agee formed MK Gold and MK Rail, and was appointed CEO of each. He moved out of company headquarters in Boise to run the enterprise from his home in Pebble Beach. MK had record profits between 1989 and 1991, much of which derived from operating revenue, accounting decisions, and non-traditional sources of income such as investments. When the rail business disintegrated after the loss of several contracts, MK found itself unable to return to its core businesses.\n\nIn February 1995, when MK announced a loss of $310 million for fiscal year 1994, the MK board voted to terminate Agee. A leak of an intended Agee resignation drew broad media attention which resulted in Agee resigning earlier than originally planned.\n\nNearing bankruptcy in 1996, Morrison-Knudsen merged with Dennis Washington's Washington Construction Group in May, and later became Washington Group International, based at MK's headquarters in Boise.\n\nAgee was Chairman of Semper Charitable Foundation, the Semper family's charitable foundation, and chaired Semper Partners, a venture capital and consulting firm founded in partnership with his wife, Mary Cunningham Agee.\n\nAn example of Agee's success in venture capital and consulting was the growth and sale of Mozzarella Fresca, a company that he helped develop into the largest fresh mozzarella manufacturer in the West with customers ranging from Whole Foods to Domino's Pizza.\n\nAgee served on the Board of Directors of Fortune 500 firms including Dow Jones (1978–1993), the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company (1974–1977), Morrison Knudsen (1974–1977 and 1981–1985) Equitable Life (1976–1985), ASARCO (1979–1981), and General Foods (1979–1983).\n\nAgee also served as a Director of Allied Corporation, MK Gold Company, MK Rail Corporation, LoJack Corporation and Key Bank Corp. Other directorships included the Committee for Economic Development, National Council for U.S. - China Trade, the Urban Institute, the Citizens Research Council of Michigan, the Detroit Renaissance Foundation, the United Foundation, the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation and the Cranbrook Education Community.\n\nAgee died from complications of respiratory failure caused by vascular degeneration, Alzheimer's Disease and Scleroderma, a connective tissue disease, at a Seattle hospital on December 20, 2017 at the age of 79.\n\nAgee received honorary doctorates from the University of Detroit (1980), Lawrence Institute of Technology (1980), Eastern Michigan University (1980), Bryant College, Cleary University, and Nathaniel Hawthorne College. In 1978, he received the Harvard Business School’s Alumni Achievement Award and in 1990 received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Agee was elected to the alumni hall of fame at the University of Idaho in 1978, and was also that year's commencement speaker.\n"}
