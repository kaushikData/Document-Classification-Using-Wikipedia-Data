Construction on the building was completed in 1961. It has 60 floors, with 5 basement floors, and is 248 meters (813 ft) tall, making it the 26th tallest building in New York City, the 43rd tallest in the United States, and the 200th tallest building in the world.\n\nThe Chase Manhattan Bank president of that time, David Rockefeller, the late patriarch of the Rockefeller family, was the prime mover of the construction and the building's location, notably because many corporations had moved uptown, and the Financial District had languished as a result. It was begun in 1956 and completed in 1961.\n\nOne Chase Manhattan Plaza is shaped like \"an enormous steel-framed rectangle\". The building has about of aboveground floor area. Another in the basements contains \"a truck entrance, mechanical equipment rooms, vaults, a [Chase] branch bank, and a cafeteria\". There are aluminum panels—chosen for their durability and performance—as well as mullions and column cladding on the facade. The columns are about thick and are about apart from each other. The columns extend from the building on its long sides. The floors cantilever on the columns on the building's short sides.\n\nThe New York Landmarks Preservation Commission designated One Chase Manhattan Plaza a landmark in 2008. On October 18, 2013, JPMorgan sold the building to Fosun, a Chinese investment company, for $725 million. Fosun rebranded One Chase Manhattan Plaza as 28 Liberty Street in 2015.\n\nThe new name refers to the east-west street on which the building sits but also connects to the Statue of Liberty in the distance and to \"the good fortune that, according to Chinese tradition, is bound up in the number 8 [and] 28 denotes 'double prosperity'\".\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The principle is that a strong vessel containing the liquid is pressurized with gas or steam, forcing the liquid into a pipe (usually vertical upwards) thereby causing flow. When the liquid has been transferred, the pressure is released and more liquid is put in via gravity. It is thus cyclic in operation. The same principle has been used to lift water and called an \"air displacement pump\" or \"intermittent gas-lift pump\", and has been applied to pumping oil up from the formation.\nIts use has largely been superseded by modern pumps, but it is still used sometimes for special tasks.\n\nThis was specifically devised to deal with the highly corrosive sulfuric acid, but was extended to other corrosive substances. It was traditionally made of ceramic (to be corrosion resistant) and spherical in shape (to withstand the pressure) thus giving its name.\nA cylindrical version (with hemispherical ends) was described by Swindin, being 3 feet in diameter and 6 feet long, holding 40 cubic feet of acid.\nIn principle, the vessel is part filled with liquid, which is then expelled by pumping in compressed air. The liquid outlet is via a pipe from the top going down almost to the bottom of the vessel. When the acid egg is emptied, connections to the compressor and the delivery pipe are closed by valves, the air pressure is vented and the vessel refilled with acid. The cycle can then start again.\n\nA French invention used in sugar production to move the partially processed sugar liquid up a pipe to the next stage of purification. Hence the name “monte-jus” or “raise juice”. Unlike the acid egg, it traditionally consists of a vertical cylindrical vessel made of steel, with a pipe from the bottom turned upwards, and it is pressurized by steam.\n"}

{"id": "31844268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31844268", "title": "Bankruptcy Law in the Republic of Ireland", "text": "Bankruptcy Law in the Republic of Ireland\n\nBankruptcy in Irish Law is a legal process, supervised by the High Court whereby the assets of a personal debtor are realised and distributed amongst his or her creditors in cases where the debtor is unable or unwilling to pay his debts.\n\nBankruptcy in Ireland applies only to natural persons. Other insolvency processes including liquidation and examinership are used to deal with corporate insolvency.\n\nA bankrupt is somebody who has been adjudicated bankrupt by the High Court. Once a debtor is adjudicated bankrupt, bankruptcy law provides for the mandatory vesting of all of the bankrupt's assets and property in the Official Assignee (OA). Under the supervision of the Court, the OA will realise the bankrupt's assets and distribute the assets according to law among the bankrupt's creditors.\n\nThe essence of bankruptcy is that the debtor's assets are transferred to an official who administers and realises them for the benefit of all creditors. The purpose is to release the bankrupt from an unsustainable debt burden and to distribute his assets amongst all creditors equally (although certain types of creditor enjoy priorities). The bankrupt person is subject to restrictions and disabilities on trading and on obtaining credit while a bankrupt but leaves the process with their debts forgiven.\n\nThe Official Assignee in bankruptcy can challenge and set aside pre-bankruptcy transactions by the bankrupt to make the assets, the subject of those transactions, available to the creditors.\n\nThe classic definition of bankruptcy is that:\n\"it is a law for the benefit and relief of creditors and their debtors, in cases in which the latter are unable or unwilling to pay their debts.\"\n\nIrish bankruptcy law has been the subject of significant recent comment, from both government sources and the media, as being in need of reform. Part 7 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 has started this process and the government has committed to further reform.\n\nWhile bankruptcy is commonly considered to arise where a person is insolvent,in Ireland a person can be adjudicated bankrupt where he has committed any act of bankruptcy\n\nAn act of bankruptcy is defined as:\n\n\"an act of default, voluntary or involuntary, committed by a debtor, which is either evidence of intent to deprive creditors of their rights through fraudulent assignment or is an implication of insolvency.\"\n\nThe following situations are considered to be acts of bankruptcy pursuant to section 7 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988:\n\n\nThe most common act of bankruptcy is where a bankruptcy summons has been served on the debtor and he has failed to pay.\n\nBankruptcy law is aimed at achieving the following.:\n\nWhen a debtor is adjudicated bankrupt, the most notable effects on his personal situation are as follows:\n\n\nThe bankrupt commits a criminal offence if he does not disclose all his property to the Court or conceals any part of his estate or if he obtains by false representation any property or credit.\n\nOffences carry the penalty on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding €634.87 or up to 12 months prison or both and on indictment of a fine not exceeding €1,269.74 or up to 5 years prison or both.\n\nPursuant to S45 of the Bankruptcy Act (as amended), a bankrupt is permitted to retain as excepted articles: clothing, furniture, bedding, tools or equipment of his trade or occupation or necessary items for himself, his/her spouse or civil partner, children and dependent relatives residing with him/her, as he may select, not exceeding in value €3,100 or such further amount as the court on an application by the bankrupt may allow.\n\nIf, having selected items up to the specified value, the bankrupt requests the official assignee not to dispose of items of the kind set out above, the OA may not dispose of such items other than in accordance with an order of the court.\n\nOn an application by the OA or by the bankrupt under this section the court may postpone the removal and sale; permit the bankrupt to retain the items or order the sale of the items at any time.\n\nOnce a bankruptcy petition issues, all uncompleted legal enforcement against the debtor is stopped. This is to preserve equality among creditors as no enforcement action can be taken against a bankrupt.\n\nThe proceeds of execution of a Court order must be retained by the Sheriff for 21 days. If a bankruptcy commences in this period, the proceeds are sent to the official assignee rather than the creditors. If the process has not been completed, then bankruptcy will freeze enforcement and the assets collected by the sheriff must be turned over to the bankruptcy trustee or OA.\n\nThe OA can apply to have proceedings stopped or restrained. Legal proceedings will generally be stopped on such terms as the court deems appropriate.\n\nOn adjudication of bankruptcy, creditors may not take action against the bankrupt's person or property without Court consent.\n\nHowever, a secured creditor can realise its security separately from the bankruptcy.\n\nA creditor is entitled to present a petition for adjudication against a debtor, without having to give notice to the debtor, if:\n\n\nService of the petition is effected by serving a copy of the petition on the debtor and showing him the original.\n\nThe following additional steps are required prior to presenting a petition:\n\n\nIf the court is satisfied that all the relevant requirements have been complied with, it will adjudicate the debtor bankrupt. A duplicate copy of this order is given to the bankruptcy inspector who serves it on the debtor. The bankruptcy inspector is a civil servant employed in the office of the OA.\n\nThe bankrupt can appeal the order but if there is no appeal then the adjudication is published in Iris Oifigiúil and a newspaper as directed by the court and a statutory sitting is held within 3 weeks of the publication. The bankrupt must make a full disclosure of all his property to the court at this hearing.\n\nPart 5 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 makes provision for an application at the statutory sitting for the appointment of a trustee who will carry out the functions normally carried out by the OA in winding up the a bankrupt's estate. These provisions have rarely been invoked.\n\nBefore a debtor may bring bankruptcy proceedings against himself, he must show that\nhe is unable to pay his debts to his creditors and that his available estate is sufficient to produce at least €1,900.00.\n\nPetitions by debtors are relatively rare in Ireland. The most high profile debtor's petition in recent times was that of Seán FitzPatrick, former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank in July 2010.\n\nThe bankrupt is obliged (pursuant to section 19 of the Bankruptcy Act 1998) to:\n\n\nThe functions of the OA are to get in and realise the property, to ascertain the debts and liabilities and to distribute the assets.\n\nIn the performance of his functions the OA shall, in particular, have powers to:\n\n\nPursuant to section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 all of the bankrupt's assets vest in the OA. This includes the bankrupt's interest in the family home. However the OA must apply to court under section 61(5)to permit him to sell a family home. The court has a discretion to postpone a sale under this section \"having regard to the interests of the creditors and of the spouse and dependents of the bankrupt as well as the circumstances of the case\".\n\nIn most circumstances the spouse of the bankrupt will assert an interest in the family home. Notwithstanding this interest the court may make an order under section 31 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 for partition of land or for sale of the land and distribution of the proceeds as the court directs. Accordingly, the OA may obtain an order for sale subject to distributing a share of the proceeds to the spouse of the bankrupt.\n\nThe mechanisms by which a spouse's interest in the family home arise are complex and careful consideration needs to be given to the existence and percentage of such interest in the circumstances of any given case.\n\nIt should also be noted that where a spouse is engaging in behaviour which may lead to the loss of any interest in the family home, with the intention to deprive a spouse of dependent child of such an interest, it is open to the other spouse to apply to court for an order under section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act 1976 to protect such an interest.\n\nCOMI is a concept introduced by the EU Insolvency Regulation which states that a person's COMI \"should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties\".\n\nThe essential elements of the COMI principles are set out below.\n\nIn a significant judgment on 10 January 2012 the High Court in Belfast held that Sean Quinn who had interests on both sides of the border did not have his COMI in Northern Ireland. Accordingly, he now faces a bankruptcy petition in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nA secured creditor has 3 options available to it where the individual who granted the security is adjudged bankrupt.\n\n\nThere are 3 ways to terminate bankruptcy.\n\nDischarge frees the debtor from all pre-bankruptcy liabilities.\n\nA bankruptcy is automatically discharged after 12 years. This is a provision introduced in 2011 and historically there was no automatic discharge.\n\nObtaining a discharge earlier than 12 years requires an application to court.\n\nA court will order a discharge/release where:\n\n\nAnnulment involves cancellation of the bankruptcy and supposes that the bankruptcy was granted in error.\n\nThere are basically two grounds for annulment.\n\nThe first applies in any case where in the opinion of the court, the debtor ought not to have been adjudicated bankrupti.e. where the order was made without jurisdiction or where there had been a clear abuse of process; where the mechanisms of the Bankruptcy Act had been improperly used.\n\nThe second applies where the bankrupt within 3 days or such extended time not exceeding 14 days as the Court thinks fit from the service of the copy of the order of adjudication on him, show cause to the Court against the validity of the adjudication.\nThis involves the bankrupt showing that the creditor(s) have not complied with any of the Creditor's Petition requirements.\n\nOnly the bankrupt can apply to have the bankruptcy annulled. Such an order can be made at any stage during the proceedings. The effect of an order is to put the bankrupt in the position he was in prior to adjudication insofar as that is possible without causing prejudice to the creditors.\n\nThe Court may review, rescind or vary an order made by it in the course of a bankruptcy matter other than an order of discharge or annulment.\n\nThe Court can rescind an adjudication of bankruptcy where:\n\n\nAn arrangement is an agreement between the debtor and his creditors. An arrangement allows a debtor to:\n\n\nAn individual may try to come to a voluntary arrangement by deed with his creditors outside the control of the court with a view to agreeing a part-payment of his debts in settlement of the claims. This arrangement does not require court approval and avoids a bankruptcy.\n\nReasons for considering this option include:\n\n\nAny arrangement made between the debtor and creditor out of court is a matter of contract between them with there being no involvement by the bankruptcy jurisdiction of the High Court. A deed of arrangement must be registered with the High Court offices. Failure to register within seven days, will make it void.\n\nThe agreement is binding on the participating creditor regardless of whether the other creditors have assented to the offer or not.\n\nThe requirements for a debtor to come to an arrangement with his creditors which is under the control of the court are as follows:\n\n\nThe role of the OA is to present to the Court for approval:\n\n\nThe court may make such order as it thinks fit for the distribution of the estate or any part thereof by payment of the expenses, fees, costs and preferential payments as well as the relevant dividend.\n\nThe court's grounds for refusal of consent for such an arrangement are broad. The court can refuse consent if:\n\n\nand may refuse to approve on certain other grounds.\n\nIt is also possible to have an arrangement with creditors after bankruptcy commences. This is known as a composition in bankruptcy. It commences with an application to court which if granted, suspends bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThe features of a post-bankruptcy arrangement are as follows:\n\n\nThe bankruptcy may be discharged when:\n\n\nBankruptcy is, at present, relatively rarely used in Ireland. This can be partly explained by the prevalence of Bankruptcy tourism which allows people to avail of less stringent bankruptcy laws outside Ireland.\n\nIrish Bankruptcy laws have been the subject of sustained criticism both regarding the complexity of the process and the minimum length of time (12 years, until amended in 2011) taken to purge bankruptcy where all of the debts of the bankrupt have not been discharged.\n\nIn the wake of the bursting of the Irish property bubble, commentators have noted the appearance of bankruptcy tourism where Irish debtors move to other jurisdictions to avail of more lenient bankruptcy laws. The most prominent cases of alleged bankruptcy tourism are perhaps those of David Drumm former chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank and property developer John Fleming. Fleming, who had personally guaranteed much of the €1 billion debt of Tivway and associated companies in Ireland, was discharged from bankruptcy in the UK on 10 November 2011, the anniversary of the date on which he was declared bankrupt there. Former government minister Ivan Yates, who has described the Irish bankruptcy regime as \"purgatory\", has publicly announced that he is contemplating moving to the UK to avail of its bankruptcy regime. One UK-based insolvency solicitor, Steve Thatcher, claimed in 2012 that he had recently written off €1bn in Irish debt for his Irish clients in the UK in only eighteen months. The high level of Irish debt being written off in the UK has prompted the government there to seek to have EU law amended to make it harder for Irish residents to move to the UK and take advantage of more lenient bankruptcy laws there[3] where bankruptcy lasts for a period of twelve months as opposed to twelve years in the Bankruptcy in Ireland. Though Thatcher dismisses the validity of the term 'bankruptcy tourism' and instead calls it 'bankruptcy emigration' as he says people have to emigrate to the UK to go bankrupt, with the majority of his clients remaining in the UK once their bankruptcy is complete.\n\nThe Law Reform Commission published an interim report on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement (LRC 96-2010). From the perspective of bankruptcy law the main recommendations of this report include an automatic discharge from bankruptcy after 3 years (subject to debtor's assets remaining in the bankruptcy and the Official Assignee being permitted to require the bankrupt to make payments for up to 5 years), an increase in the level of debt required to bring a creditor's petition to €50,000 and a reduction in the range of priority debts in bankruptcy.\n\nThe government committed to reform personal insolvency law in a memorandum of understanding with the EU and the International Monetary Fund. Commentators have expressed the view that there is a risk that this will not be completed on the agreed timetable. The government has stated that it intends to publish a bill in this regard by Easter 2012.\n\nPart 7 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 while not going as far as proposed in the Law Reform Commission Report, has made substantial amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1988 including:\n\nOn 24 January 2012 the Department of Justice and Equality published the Draft General Scheme of a new personal insolvency bill. The proposed bill would, among other things, reduce the period of bankruptcy to 3 years and introduce three different non-judicial mechanisms to deal with debt. The full bill was expected to be published by the end of April 2012.\n\nOn 29 June 2012 the Irish Government published the text of the bill. The bill provides for, amongst other things:\n\nThe Personal Insolvency Act 2012 was signed by the President on 26 December 2012 and the Minister indicated that he expects licensing of personal insolvency practitioners to take place in April/May 2012 but did not indicate when he expected the first debtors would utilise the new insolvency mechanisms.\n\n\n"}

Beginning with the New York City financial crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, state and local governments began overhauling their financial management systems. In 1990, the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) act called for reforms that brought the goal of accountability to the forefront. The 1994 Bankruptcy of Orange County, California further underscored the need for ongoing excellence and expertise in the field of municipal finance.\n\nMembers are finance directors and treasurers of municipalities and other local government agencies, whether elected or appointed, having responsibility for collection, receipt, reporting, custody, investment or disbursement of municipal funds. Municipal funding sources are commonly property tax, sales tax, income tax, utility users tax (UUT), transient occupancy tax (hotel occupancy), and user fees such as licensing and permit fees.\n\nMichael Genest is the Finance Director and Bill Lockyer is the Treasurer of the State of California. There are 480 California cities, 58 California counties about 3,400 Special Districts and School Districts, each with independent fiscal stewardship. Many City Treasurers are elected, and are therefore directly accountable to their constituents; the remainder are appointed either by City Council or City Manager. Finance Directors typically are appointed by the City Manager.\n\nCertification is a guide for municipal finance directors and treasurers to become valued administrators in local government. CSMFO encourages professional certification for public finance directors and treasurers who meet standards of education, experience and commitment to a code of ethics. CSMFO does not offer its own post-nominal professional certificate since GFOA already administers the Certified Professional Finance Officer (CPFO), CMTA offers the Certified California Municipal Treasurer (CCMT) certification program, and the Association of Government Accountants offers the Certified Government Financial Manager (CGFM) certification, requiring six hours of testing on Federal, State and Local Government Financial material. \n\nMembers are enjoined to adhere to legal, moral and professional standards of conduct. The following ethical principles govern the conduct of the Municipal members of the California Society of Municipal Finance Officers who shall:\n\n1. Demonstrate and be dedicated to the highest ideals of honor and integrity in all public and personal relationships to merit the respect and confidence of the elected officials, other public officials, employees and the public.\n\n2. Recognize and be accountable for their responsibilities as public officials; be sensitive and responsive to the rights of the public.\n\n3. Exercise prudence and integrity in the management of funds in their custody and in all financial transactions.\n\n4. Maintain their own competence, enhance the competence of their colleagues and staff members, and provide encouragement to those seeking to enter the field of government finance.\n\n5. Seek excellence in the public service; be well informed and well prepared to exercise public authority.\n\n6. Demonstrate professional integrity in the issuance and management of information; prepare and present statements and financial information fairly, in accordance with law and generally accepted practices and guidelines.\n\n7. Respect and protect privileged information; be sensitive and responsive to inquiries from the public and the media within the framework of local government policy.\n\n8. Act with honor, integrity and virtue in all professional relationships; respect the rights of their colleagues and other public officials with whom they work and associate.\n\n9. Handle all matters of personnel within the scope of their authority on the basis of merit so that fairness and impartiality govern their decisions.\n\n10. Seek no favor or accept any personal gain which would influence, or appear to influence, the conduct of their official duties.\n\n11. Protect the public trust, avoid even the appearance of impropriety, and safeguard the integrity of the government they serve.\n\nCSMFO has technical and professional committees that deal with financial issues facing government and the public. CSMFO also provides web-based technical support resources, educational material, conferences and technical publications for its members. CSMFO's annual statewide conferences provide an array of education across many topics and alternate annually between various northern and southern cities. By assembling leadership from a broad representation of government agencies and also bringing in subject matter experts in various disciplines, the collective expertise and professionalism of financial managers and policymakers is enhanced and improved.\n\nCSMFO is recognized as a leading source of expert knowledge in public financial management by exercising leadership in research, recommended practice and policy development, and information dissemination. Nationwide recognition is furthered through a continued association with the nationwide Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). Statewide recognition is furthered through a thorough participation of members drawn from many cities, counties and special districts.\n\nStanding Committees\nFinancial Leadership is furthered by engaging in efforts to assist statewide finance officers to develop the skills and capabilities necessary to enable them to become organizational leaders as well as technical experts. <br>\nThe CSMFO website is a well-known statewide resource for a variety of documents relevant to local government, the most obvious benefit of which is to avoid inefficient duplication of effort and to make more knowledge available statewide to everyone. CSMFO's library of resources includes sample RFPs, job descriptions, and a variety of documents and information relevant to local government. Categories of posted information include Accounting/Financial Reporting, Budgeting, Consultants, Investments/Cash Management, Job Descriptions, Payroll, Human Resources, Policies & Procedures, Revenue Management, RFPs/RFQs, and Technology.\n\nCSMFO facilitates interagency communication for the purposes of sharing information and best practices. Cooperate with and complement the services provided by other organizations to increase the effectiveness of all.\n\nLike GFOA nationwide, CSMFO sponsors award programs designed to encourage good financial reporting in California, for financial documents including the Comprehensive annual financial report, or CAFR, and the annual budget.\n\nCSMFO provides technology information and analytical tools to help governments identify and apply appropriate, economical technologies to support efficient resource allocation, quality services, and effective decision making and to promote citizen involvement.\n\n"}

{"id": "374483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=374483", "title": "Chris Argyris", "text": "Chris Argyris\n\nChris Argyris (July 16, 1923 – November 16, 2013) was an American business theorist, Professor Emeritus at Harvard Business School, and held the position of \"Thought Leader\" at Monitor Group. Argyris is next to Richard Beckhard, Edgar Schein and Warren Bennis known as co-founder of organization development, and known for seminal work of learning organizations.\n\nBorn into a family of Greek immigrants to the United States in Newark, New Jersey, Argyris (pronounced AHR-JUR-ris) grew up in Irvington, New Jersey and Athens, Greece. In World War II he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. After his service he studied psychology at Clark University, where he met Kurt Lewin. He obtained his MA in 1947, and joined the Kansas University, where he obtained his MSc in Psychology and Economics in 1949. In 1951 received his PhD from Cornell University, with a thesis on the behavior in organizations under the supervision of William F. Whyte.\n\nIn 1951 Argyris started his academic career at Yale University as part of the Yale Labor and Management Center where he worked under its director and an early influence, E. Wight Bakke. At Yale he subsequently became appointed Professor of Management science. In 1971 he moved to Harvard University, where he was Professor of Education and Organizational Behavior, until his retirement. Argyris was active as director of the consulting firm Monitor in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nChris Argyris received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Toronto in 2006. He also received a Doctor of Science award from Yale University in 2011.\n\nChris Argyris' early research explored the impact of formal organizational structures, control systems and management on individuals and how they responded and adapted to them. This research resulted in the books \"Personality and Organization\" (1957) and \"Integrating the Individual and the Organization\" (1964). He then shifted his focus to organizational change, in particular exploring the behaviour of senior executives in organizations (\"Interpersonal Competence and Organizational Effectiveness\" (1962); \"Organization and Innovation\" (1965).\n\nFrom there he moved on to an inquiry into the role of the social scientist as both researcher and actor (\"Intervention Theory and Method\" (1970); \"Inner Contradictions of Rigorous Research\" (1980) and \"Action Science\" (1985) – with Robert Putnam and Diana McLain Smith). His fourth major area of research and theorizing – in significant part undertaken with Donald Schön – was in individual and organizational learning and the extent to which human reasoning, not just behavior, can become the basis for diagnosis and action (\"Theory in Practice\" (1974); \"Organizational Learning\" (1978); \"Organizational Learning II\" (1996) – all with Donald Schön). He has also developed this thinking in \"Overcoming Organizational Defenses\" (1990) and \"Knowledge for Action\" (1993).\n\nArgyris believed that managers who treat people positively and as responsible adults will achieve productivity. Mature workers want additional responsibilities, variety of tasks, and the ability to participate in decisions. He also came to the conclusion that problems with employees are the result of mature personalities managed using outdated practices.\n\nArgyris' collaborative work with Robert W. Putnam, (not to be confused with Robert D. Putnam), and Diana McLain Smith advocates an approach to research that focuses on generating knowledge that is useful in solving practical problems. Other key concepts developed by Argyris include ladder of inference, double-loop learning , theory of action/espoused theory/theory-in-use, high advocacy/high inquiry dialogue and actionable knowledge and the study of adult personality.\n\nArgyris' concept of Action Science begins with the study of how human beings design their actions in difficult situations. Human actions are designed to achieve intended consequences and governed by a set of environment variables. How those governing variables are treated in designing actions are the key differences between single-loop learning and double-loop learning. When actions are designed to achieve the intended consequences and to suppress conflict about the governing variables, a single-loop learning cycle usually ensues. On the other hand, when actions are taken, not only to achieve the intended consequences, but also to openly inquire about conflict and to possibly transform the governing variables, both single-loop and double-loop learning cycles usually ensue. (Argyris applies single-loop and double-loop learning concepts not only to personal behaviors but also to organizational behaviors in his models.)\n\nModel 1 illustrates how single-loop learning affects human actions. Model 2 describes how double-loop learning affects human actions. The following Model 1 and Model 2 tables introduce these ideas (tables are from Argyris, Putnam & Smith, 1985, Action Science, Ch. 3). Other key books conveying Argyris' approach include Argyris & Schon, 1974 and Argyris, 1970, 1980, 1994).\n\nTable 1, Model 1: Theory-In-Use: defensive reasoning\nTable 2, Model 2: Theory-In-Use: productive reasoning\n\n\n\n"}

It is the most widely-used analytics model. \n\nIn 2015, IBM corporation released a new methodology called \"Analytics Solutions Unified Method for Data Mining/Predictive Analytics\" (also known as ASUM-DM) which refines and extends CRISP-DM. \n\nCRISP-DM was conceived in 1996 and became a European Union project under the ESPRIT funding initiative in 1997. The project was led by five companies: Integral Solutions Ltd (ISL), Teradata, Daimler AG, NCR Corporation and OHRA, an insurance company.\n\nThis core consortium brought different experiences to the project: ISL, later acquired and merged into SPSS. The computer giant NCR Corporation produced the Teradata data warehouse and its own data mining software. Daimler-Benz had a significant data mining team. OHRA was just starting to explore the potential use of data mining.\n\nThe first version of the methodology was presented at the 4th CRISP-DM SIG Workshop in Brussels in March 1999, and published as a step-by-step data mining guide later that year.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2008 a CRISP-DM 2.0 SIG was formed and there were discussions about updating the CRISP-DM process model. The current status of these efforts is not known. However, the original crisp-dm.org website cited in the reviews, and the CRISP-DM 2.0 SIG website are both no longer active.\n\nWhile many non-IBM data mining practitioners use CRISP-DM, IBM is the primary corporation that currently embraces the CRISP-DM process model. It makes some of the old CRISP-DM documents available for download and it has incorporated it into its SPSS Modeler product.\n\nBased on current research CRISP-DM is the most widely used form of data-mining model because of its various advantages which solved the existing problems in the data mining industries. Some of the drawbacks of this model is that it does not perform project management activities. The fact behind the success of CRISP-DM is that it is industry, tool, and application neutral.\n\nCRISP-DM breaks the process of data mining into six major phases.\n\nThe sequence of the phases is not strict and moving back and forth between different phases as it is always required. The arrows in the process diagram indicate the most important and frequent dependencies between phases. The outer circle in the diagram symbolizes the cyclic nature of data mining itself. A data mining process continues after a solution has been deployed. The lessons learned during the process can trigger new, often more focused business questions, and subsequent data mining processes will benefit from the experiences of previous ones.\n\nPolls conducted at the same website (KDNuggets) in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that it was the leading methodology used by industry data miners who decided to respond to the survey. The only other data mining approach named in these polls was SEMMA. However, SAS Institute clearly states that SEMMA is not a data mining methodology, but rather a \"logical organization of the functional toolset of SAS Enterprise Miner.\" A review and critique of data mining process models in 2009 called the CRISP-DM the \"de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects.\" Other reviews of CRISP-DM and data mining process models include Kurgan and Musilek's 2006 review, and Azevedo and Santos' 2008 comparison of CRISP-DM and SEMMA. Efforts to update the methodology started in 2006, but have not led to a new version, and the \"Special Interest Group\" (SIG) responsible along with the website has long disappeared (see History of CRISP-DM).\n"}
{"id": "14200444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14200444", "title": "Dala Modu Dumbuya", "text": "Dala Modu Dumbuya\n\nDala Modu was an important Sierra Leonean Susu trader and translator between the British Colonial Government and the local chiefs in the interior in the early decades of the British Colony in Sierra Leone. His efforts helped in resolving a number of conflicts between the colonial and interior rulers. His reputation as a major commercial force was enhanced in the process, and he built up the prominent Soso community around Lungi in the Kafu Bullom country.\n\nDala Modu was born in 1770 in Wonkafong, Sumbuya near Conakry, Guinea into a family of traders. His father, Fenda Modu, had been advisor to the King of Sumbuya and Headman of Wonkafong. Although born in Guinea, he was raised in Freetown. Dala Modu first came to Freetown at the age of four years, with his father in 1774. Desirous of fostering his commercial contacts with the new colony, Fenda Modu sent his son Dala Modu with fifty followers in 1795 to settle on the outskirts of Freetown. The town Dala Modu built up there, named Dalamodiya after him, quickly became a commercial centre, and he became landlord for many traders from the interior, mostly from his own Soso ethnic group. Dala Modu was welcomed by the British, who were also keen on developing the trade with the interior on which the colony's survival depended. In Freetown Dala Modu learned English and studied the colony's monetary system and weights and measures.\n\nDala Modu's business activities became very extensive, involving colony officials, both European and African, and the local traders, for whom he acted as agent. He became the primary landlord to visiting traders from the distant interior, giving them advice and assistance on how to get the best out of their trade goods in the colony. In this process, he developed close contacts with the Freetown merchants to whom he directed the interior traders.\n\nDala Modu became the local agent to the European firm of Macaulay and Babington in 1826. The European agent of that Company, Kenneth Macaulay, was a close associate of Dala Modu when he acted as governor in that year. Modu organised the felling and processing of timber for the company from his base at Madina on the Bullom Shore, where he had lived since 1806. This was done with a large band of servile labour he retained there. For the 1826 season alone, he received £1,000 as partial payment. In 1834, many gold traders from the interior came to the colony through him, bringing him much wealth in broker's fees.\n\nDala Modu used his wealth and business contacts to build for himself a prominent position in the relations between the colony officials and the local rulers in the interior. He was helped in this by his powerful family connections in the Northern River areas (north of the Scarcies), where his family owned parts of the major trading islands. These came in handy in treaties of cession he negotiated in 1818 and 1825 with the colonial government, which was eager to use these islands, like Matacong and the Isles de Los, as customs posts.\n\nBut Dala Modu's personal qualities of diplomacy undoubtedly played a major role in winning the favoured position he came to enjoy. As early as 1802, soon after the rebellion of the Nova Scotian settlers in the colony, Dala Modu was instrumental in convincing the Mandinka chiefs to withdraw their support for the rebels and to hand over the leaders of the uprising to the British. But, in 1806, he was accused of slave trading and other charges. When called to answer these charges, he appeared in Muslim robes rather than the European dress he was used to wearing in Freetown. This angered the British authorities, who proceeded to expel him from the colony. Dala Modu then moved to Madina on the Bullom Shore from where he continued his business activities. It was there that he built up the Sosso community with migrants coming from the interior. Dala Modu thus because effectively the King of Kafu Bullom and Loko Masama, but his influence extended as far as the Port Loko areas. In fact, he became ruler of Rokon on the Rokel in 1837.\n\nThe colonial government in Freetown soon realized that it needed Dala Modu's services in settling disputes in the interior. From 1818, when he arranged the cession of the Isles de Los to the British, he started receiving an annual payment from them. Between 1820 and 1841, Dala Modu arranged peace talks on a number of occasions to settle local disputes the Colony Government felt were inhibiting trade. These included the rebellion on the north Rokel in 1835, and the Temne/Loko war in 1836. Though he did not get along well with some of the governors, succeeding ones were quick to realise his worth and do business with him. Governor Henry Dundas Campbell visited him in 1835 and was struck by his intelligence and affluent style of living.\n\nWhen Dala Modu died, over eighty cows were slaughtered during his funeral ceremonies, attended by British and African officials from the colony and by many local chiefs from the interior. Dala Modu was among the first indigenous entrepreneurs to take advantage of the new business opportunities arising after the abolition of the slave trade.\n"}
{"id": "3271879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3271879", "title": "Delbarton School", "text": "Delbarton School\n\nDelbarton School is a private all-male Roman Catholic college-preparatory school in Morristown, in Morris County, New Jersey, United States, educating young men in seventh through twelfth grades. Delbarton is a Catholic independent school directed by the Benedictine monks of St. Mary's Abbey. The school is located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson, operating on an independent basis.\n\nAs of the 2015-16 school year, the school had an enrollment of 572 students and 72.4 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 7.9:1. The school's student body was 75.2% White, 9.3% Asian, 5.2% Hispanic, 2.1% Black, 0.2% Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander and 8.0% two or more races. Delbarton's student body comprises students from more than eight New Jersey counties and 100 communities.\n\nIn 2007, \"The Wall Street Journal\" ranked Delbarton School ninth among America's high schools. For the 1983-84 school year, Delbarton School received the National Blue Ribbon Award of Excellence from the United States Department of Education, the highest honor that an American school can achieve. In 2018, Niche.com ranked Delbarton second among Catholic high schools in the United States, and eighth among all private schools.\n\nDelbarton is a member of the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools and has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Secondary Schools since 1961.\n\nThe school offers financial aid to families who cannot afford the cost of tuition, and financial aid offers are considered independently of admission. Annual tuition is $37,900 for the 2017-18 school year. Delbarton is a host site for NJ Seeds' young scholars program where every summer academically qualified but economically disadvantaged students attend classes on the Delbarton campus.\n\nIn the 1880s, Luther Kountze established an estate in northern New Jersey. He began to buy more land, eventually expanding his estate to cover . This eventually became the home of St. Mary's Abbey/Delbarton, Morristown National Historical Park and Lewis Morris County Park. Kountze eventually named the estate \"Delbarton,\" borrowing one syllable from the names of each of his first three children (DELancey, BARclay and LivingsTON).\n\nIn 1918, Kountze died, leaving the entire property to his family. The family decided to put the estate for sale. In 1925, the monks of Saint Mary's Abbey, then in Newark, purchased approximately four hundred acres of Delbarton to use as a separate house for younger members for studying, finally settling on the property in 1927.\n\nAfter some time, the monks decided to open a secondary school, as the Newark residence had done so with Saint Benedict's Preparatory School. After some deliberation, Abbot Patrick O'Brien opened Delbarton School in 1939, appointing Father Augustine Wirth as the first headmaster. At that time, the school was a boarding school for sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students.\n\nIn 1942, Father Stephen Findlay succeeded as Headmaster and introduced drastic changes. The grade levels were modified, ultimately resulting in seventh through twelfth grades being offered. The Kountze carriage house was destroyed in a fire in 1947, leading to the construction of the St. Joseph Gymnasium. Because of the fire, the school chose as its motto, \"Succisa Virescit\" (having been cut down, she grows back stronger), borrowing from the often destroyed Abbey of Monte Cassino in Italy. Trinity Hall opened in 1959, allowing the enrollment to increase to over 300. Father Stephen retired in 1967 to the position of Director of Development. In 1971, the Schmeil-O'Brien Hall dormitory was dedicated, although the majority of students were day students.\n\nDelbarton's fourth headmaster, Father Gerard Lair (1975–1980), initiated more changes. The system of discipline from demerits and detention changed to a conversational program designed to bring about positive changes. As the academic prestige of the School grew, the Board of Trustees decided to terminate the residential program in 1978. The last two resident students graduated in 1983.\n\nSince then, more facilities have been built, with the dedication of the Lynch Athletic Center in 1983, Findlay Science Pavilion in 1995, Fine Arts Center in 2006, the 40 Acres soccer and baseball fields in 2009, and the Cocoziello Field and Posserelli Track in 2010.\n\nMolestation allegations against a monk at Delbarton resulted in lawsuits being filed against the school by two former students who claimed to have been inappropriately touched by the Reverend.\n\nDelbarton has made many efforts to open up the student body to the international community. Over the past few years many respectable speakers have spoken to the student body including Dith Pran and Lech Wałęsa.\n\nDelbarton students also have several opportunities to travel abroad. The school participates in foreign exchange programs with schools in Ireland, particularly sister school Glenstal Abbey School in County Limerick, and the Bildungszentrum Markdorf School in Markdorf, Germany. Juniors can travel to the Caribbean during the summer between their junior and senior year to learn about the culture and history of select islands through the school's SOL program. Students also have the opportunity to experience eco-tourism first hand in Costa Rica. Students have visited nature reserves, Arenal Volcano, Poás Volcano National Park and Monteverde while studying at the CPI language school in Heredia, Costa Rica. Delbarton students have also traveled to Spain on several organized summer trips and to Germany for World Youth Day with the school's religious educator David Hajduk. The school has also sent several students to help assist in Operation Smile Missions in China, Honduras, and Thailand. The most recent established trip overseas was a mission trip to Nairobi, Kenya, and Hanga, Tanzania, where students donated money and aid to several schools. The school's various musical ensembles also travel to foreign countries to tour and perform.\n\nStudents participate in the school's Model United Nations and Challenge 20/20 clubs. The Model United Nations club participates in four to five Model UN Conferences every year and has attained much success, winning the Best Small Delegation Award at Princeton's 2005 conference, the 2007 Seton Hall University conference, and 2009 WAMUNC. The club also participated in The Hague International Model United Nations, held in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2008.\n\n Delbarton operates an 8:10 a.m. to 2:34 p.m. schedule, including six class periods, a conference period, and lunch. The schedule is a seven-day rotating block schedule (\"A day\" through \"G day\") with one class dropping out of the schedule each of the seven days. The blocks are named each school year in keeping with the year's academic theme, which honors figures of heroism, social justice, promoters of worldwide peace, or historically important figures. All students have a thirty-minute free period (\"M block\") from 10:00 to 10:35 AM. Teachers, guidance, and college counseling are available during M block and after school for extra assistance as needed. Although the school day ends at 2:40 PM, the first buses do not leave campus until 4:00 PM, which encourages students to pursue extracurricular activities, work with faculty on homework and special projects, and volunteer on one of the many community service projects the school sponsors. Late bus service is also offered at 6:00 PM.\n\nDelbarton offers 24 Advanced Placement courses. In 2009, 107 Delbarton students qualified as AP scholars, with 16 students qualifying for the National AP Scholar Award, 37 qualifying for the AP Scholar with Distinction Award, 26 qualifying for the AP Scholar with Honor Award, and 34 students qualifying for the AP Scholar Award. Delbarton does not offer any courses designated explicitly as \"honors\" because even classes not designated as \"AP\" are taught well beyond the traditional high school level. For example, students may take mathematics classes up to 3 years ahead of the nation-wide standard (Algebra 1 in freshman year). Advanced math courses such as Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and AP Statistics are offered, as are independent study options. Language and literature courses are also offered in several languages.\n\nWith few exceptions, nearly all graduates continue on to four-year colleges or universities. Delbarton students are recognized for their academic achievements. In 2010, there were two National Merit Scholarships, three finalists, and 13 commended students. Eleven students were named Edward J. Bloustein Distinguished Scholars.\n\nThe Delbarton Green Wave competes in the Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC), following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). Before the NJSIAA's 2010 realignment, the school had competed in the Northern Hills Conference an athletic conference made up of private and public high schools located in Essex, Morris and Passaic counties.\n\nDelbarton offers cross country, football and soccer as sports in the Fall season.\n\nDelbarton's football program has won state football championships in 1993 and in 1998. The team won the Group III Parochial title in 1993 with a 24-23 victory over Saint Joseph Regional High School. The team won the 1998 title with a 21-3 victory over Immaculata High School. Delbarton has also finished second in the state sectional finals in 1988, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2005, 2006, 2011, 2012 and 2014.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1987, Delbarton was coached by William Regan Sr., who compiled a 236-83-10 record with 33 winning seasons and 7 undefeated seasons.\n\nFrom 1987 to 2002, Delbarton was coached by John Kowalik whose tenure included state titles in 1993 and 1998, state tournament playoff losses in 1997, 1999, and 2001 by fewer than six points in each game and five consecutive Northern Hills Conference championships for 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, finishing his career with a record of 138-29.\n\nSince 2003, the coach has been Brian Bowers. During this time period, the team transitioned to the North Jersey Athletic Conference in 2009. Delbarton won NJAC championships in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Since 2016, the Green Wave joined the North Jersey Super Football Conference, playing in the \"White Division.\"\n\nDelbarton has won six Morris County soccer championships and seven New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (\"NJSIAA\") championships since 1995 under former all-American David Donovan. In 1997, under interim head coach Erin Sullivan, Delbarton won a triple crown - winning the Northern Hills Conference, Morris County Tournament and NJSIAA Parochial A state tournament. Again in 2003 and 2004, Delbarton won the triple crown, finishing second in \"The Star-Ledger\" state rankings in 2003 and first in 2004. In 2003, the team beat Saint Benedict's Preparatory School of Newark, New Jersey, which was the number one team in the country and had not lost to a New Jersey team in 12 years. In 2007, Delbarton's soccer team made it to the North Jersey Non-Public A final and had achieved a No. 4 ranking in the nation but lost by a 3-2 score to Seton Hall Preparatory School. Delbarton also earned a #2 ranking in the Non-Public A soccer group for the 2008 soccer season. The 2011 Delbarton soccer team won the Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference (\"NJAC\") regular season title as well as the NJSIAA Non-Public A North sectional championship and was ranked as high as #2 in the state.

The 2013 edition of Delbarton soccer followed the success of its predecessor with some historic feats of its own. While the 2012 side bludgeoned opponents with offense (scoring over 90 goals), the 2013 team suffocated its competition with defense, allowing only three goals all year and stamping its 22-1-1 record with 22 shutouts, including 18 in a row to close the season. Along the way, the Wave won the triple crown of conference, county and state championships and earned Delbarton both a second consecutive Star-Ledger #1 state ranking as well as a national ranking by the NSCAA (#24). \"The Star-Ledger\" named Coach Donovan its NJ Coach of the Year and Mike Moshier (NSCAA Regional All-American) a first-team All-State selection.

Through its industry initiatives and the euro payment systems it has delivered, the EBA is a key contributor to the creation of a standardised Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).\n\nThe Euro Banking Association (EBA) was founded in Paris in 1985 by 18 commercial banks and the European Investment Bank. The European Commission as well as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) supported the founding of the EBA. Since then, the number of members has risen to almost 200. The institutions come from all member states of the European Union as well as from Norway, Switzerland, Australia, China, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.\n\nIn its early years, the agenda of the EBA included the promotion of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the development and management of a private industry ECU clearing system stretching across Europe.\n\nFor the start of the EMU, the EBA delivered EURO1, a RTGS-equivalent large-value payment system for single euro transactions. The EBA also developed STEP1, a payment service for single euro payments of high priority and urgency for small and medium-sized banks, and STEP2, a Pan-European Automated Clearing House (PE-ACH), which processes euro retail payments. All three payment systems are run by EBA Clearing.\n\nAs the largest network of payment practitioners with a pan-European mindset and vision, the EBA provides a country-neutral forum for discussing and driving payment initiatives. Based on the support of its unique membership, the EBA contributes to the development and improvement of pan-European business practices in co-operation with regulatory and industry bodies. The communication and explanation of these business practices and other industry developments to its membership and to the wider industry constitute another important part of the EBA’s mission.\n\nOnce a year, the EBA brings together its member banks and organisations as well as other stakeholders in the market for a pan-European payments conference entitled EBAday.\n\nThe association is based in Paris.\n"}

{"id": "48690414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48690414", "title": "European consumer law", "text": "European consumer law\n\nEuropean consumer law concerns consumer protection within Europe, particularly through European Union law and the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nProtection of European consumers has been a central part of developing the EU internal market. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 169 enables the EU to follow the ordinary legislative procedure to protect consumers \"health, safety and economic interests\" and promote rights to \"information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests\". All member states may grant higher protection, and a \"high level of consumer protection\" is regarded as a fundamental right. Beyond these general principles, and outside specific sectors, there are four main Directives: the Product Liability Directive 1985, Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993, Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005 and the Consumer Rights Directive 2011, requiring information and cancellation rights for consumers. As a whole, the law is designed to ensure that consumers in the EU are entitled to the same minimum rights wherever they shop, and largely follows inspiration from theories of consumer protection developed in California and the Consumer Bill of Rights proclaimed by John F. Kennedy in 1962. The Court of Justice has continually affirmed that the need for more consumer rights (than in commercial contracts) both because consumers tend to lack information, and they have less bargaining power.<ref name=\"Case C-618/10\">See \"Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino\" (2012) Case C-618/10, [39] and \"Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores\" (2000) C-240/98 to C-244/98 and [2000] ECR I-4941, [25]</ref>\nThe Product Liability Directive 1985 was the first consumer protection measure. It creates strict enterprise liability for all producers and retailers for any harm to consumers from products, as a way to promote basic standards of health and safety. Any producer, or supplier if the ultimate producer is insolvent, of a product is strictly liable to compensate a consumer for any damage caused by a defective product. A \"defect\" is anything which falls below what a consumer is entitled to expect, and this essentially means that products should be safe for their purpose. A narrow defensive is available if a producer can show that a defect could not be known by any scientific method, thought this has never been successfully invoked, because it is generally thought a profit making enterprise should not be able to externalise the risks of its activities.\n\nThe Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993 was the second main measure. Under article 3(1) a term is unfair, and not binding, if it is not \"individually negotiated| and \"if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer\". The Court of Justice has continually affirmed that the Directive, as recital 16 states, \"is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge\". Terms which are very skewed, are to be conclusively regarded as contrary to \"good faith\" and therefore unfair. For example, in \"RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV\", clauses in gas supply contracts enabling the German utiliies company RWE to vary unilaterally prices were advised by the Court of Justice to be insufficiently transparent, and therefore unfair. In \"Brusse v Jahani BV\" the Court of Justice advised that clauses in a tenancy contract requiring tenants pay €25 per day were likely unfair, and would have to be entirely void without replacement, if they were not substituted with more precise mandatory terms in national legislation. In \"Aziz v Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya\", following the global financial crisis, the Court of Justice advised that even terms regarding repossession of homes in Spain had to be assessed for fairness by national courts. In \"Kušionová v SMART Capital a.s.\", the Court of Justice held that consumer law was to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, including the right to housing, in the event that a home could be repossessed. Because consumer law operates through Directives, national courts have the final say on applying the general principles set out by the Court of Justice's case law.\n\n\n\nThe European Commission announced plans in April 2018 to strengthen consumer law and the coordination of consumer rights enforcement by national authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hampel at various times identified himself as a Social Democrat/Socialist, and Progressive; and joined the Republicans when the Progressives rejoined the latter party.\n\nHampel was born in Milwaukee in 1885. He was educated at West Division High School, part of the Milwaukee Public Schools, and also took classes at the International Correspondence Schools and Hesse's Art School. Hampel was an accountant and president of Hampel's Book Shop, Inc.\n\nHe began his political career in 1916 by running unsuccessfully for State Treasurer of Wisconsin as a Social Democrat, as they were called in Wisconsin, receiving only 31,329 votes to Republican Merlin Hull's 232,171. In 1916 he was appointed to the Milwaukee Motion Picture Commission, a film censorship body; he would remain on the Commission until 1940. Hampel was soon elected as county clerk of Milwaukee County, serving from 1919 to 1920 While serving as clerk, Hampel testified and wrote an affidavit in support of fellow Wisconsin socialist Victor Berger for the Congressman's House hearings regarding whether he should be seated. In 1920, he was a delegate to the Convention of the Socialist Party of America.\n\nAfter ten years away from elected office, Hampel won election as a Socialist to the Wisconsin State Assembly representing Milwaukee County's third Assembly district in 1930, winning 2994 votes versus Republican Frank G. Pope's 2,058, and Democrat John H. Stemper's 545. Two years later he ran for the Wisconsin State Senate's Sixth District seat, but lost to Democrat Charles H. Phillips. Phillips received 14,885 votes; Hampel 13,951; Republican George W. Becker 3,433; and former Republican Assemblyman (running as an independent) Martin M. Higgins 267 Hampel was successful when he ran again for the seat in 1936, this time running as a Progressive. He was reelected as a Progressive in 1940. Although Hampel had been a member of both the Socialist Party of America and the Wisconsin Progressive Party, he left the Socialists in 1941 after that party ordered its members to quit the Progressive Party. He served as a vice chairman and Milwaukee County chairman of the state Progressive Party in the early 1940s. He failed to keep his state senate seat when he ran without any party affiliation in 1944, losing to Democrat Edward W. Reuther. Reuther received 22,163 votes; Republican Arthur H. Schroeder 17,272; Hampel 4,222; and Socialist former Assemblyman and Senator Alex C. Ruffing 3,112 votes.\n\nWhen the Wisconsin Progressive Party no longer remained a viable third party after the 1944 elections, Hampel and his son argued against joining the Democrats and instead favored rejoining the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Hampel then helped to lead the Progressives back into the Republican Party fold after the declining party voted in favor of such a merger on March 17, 1946.\n\nIn later years, Hampel worked as manager of the Cedar Creek Distillery in Cedarburg, Wisconsin.\n\nHampel was married to Louise Hampel. They had three children: Ruth, Gordon and George Jr., the latter of whom served as a member of the Milwaukee Board of Trustees. He died in Milwaukee in 1954, and was buried in Wanderer's Rest Cemetery.\n"}

HHI also has five non-core related subsidiaries: Hyundai Electric & Energy Systems, Hyundai Construction Equipment, Hyundai Robotics, Hyundai Heavy Industries Green Energy, and Hyundai Global Service.\n\nThe Hyundai Group started as a small South Korean construction firm in 1947, headed by its founder, Korean entrepreneur Chung Ju-Yung. Another widely known and closely related Korean company, the Hyundai Motor Company, was founded in 1967, five years prior to the founding of the Heavy Industry Group. The motor company was also founded by Chung. \n\nThe name is an informal romanisation of the Korean (\"hyeondae\") meaning \"contemporary\", which was Chung's vision for the group of companies that he founded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

LSF conducted historical research, maintained archives and published historically relevant materials and information. Their public support of climate-science denier Rep. Dana Rohrabacher in 2018 caused a backlash against the foundation and eroded their scientific credibility.\n\nOn December 1, 2015, the LSF and the Chemical Heritage Foundation finalized a merger, creating one organization that covers \"the history of the life sciences and biotechnology together with the history of the chemical sciences and engineering.\"\nAs of February 1, 2018, the organization was renamed the Science History Institute, to reflect its wider range of historical interests, from chemical sciences and engineering to the life sciences and biotechnology.\nThe organization is headquartered in Philadelphia but retains offices in the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nThe LSF mandate was to collect and promote the history of biotechnology. This includes telling the stories of \"scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, managers, executives, and financiers\" in order to \"humanize\" biotechnology to a lay audience. The history of the biotechnology industry includes examining the complex relationships and socio-political dynamics that occur when science and entrepreneurship come together.\n\nThe idea for a foundation that would collect and share the history of biotechnology came about at a meeting in early January 2009 in San Francisco attended by G. Steven Burrill of Burrill & Company, Dennis Gillings of Quintiles in Durham, NC, John Lechleiter of Eli Lilly & Co., Henri Termeer, then CEO of Genzyme and Arnold Thackray, founding President and CEO of the Chemical Heritage Foundation (CHF)\n\nThackray had shaped Chemical Heritage Foundation—\"the premier institution preserving the history of chemistry, chemical engineering, and related sciences and technologies.\" Oral history was one component of the CHF mandate of preserving interpreting, and promoting the history of science. In 1982 the University of Pennsylvania and the American Chemical Society had launched the Center for the History of Chemistry which was renamed the Chemical Heritage Foundation (CHF) in 1992. Thackray, a Fellow of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Historical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry, Thackray received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in the history of science from Cambridge University.\n\nThackray argued that before LSF was founded, the recorded history of biotechnology was \"fragmented, uneven, and rather paltry.\" He observed that, \"If you don't write your own history, somebody else will do it for you, and they may be hostile.\"\n\nBy the end of 2011, LSF's steering committee of industry leaders— Joshua Boger, Robert Carpenter, Bob Coughlin, Henri Termeer and Peter Wirth— were promoting the foundation's work by encouraging scientists and industrialists who were members of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, to contribute potential stories and materials to the archival record of the history of biotechnology in Boston and the surrounding region.\n\nThe Life Sciences Foundation conducted oral history interviews with scientists, entrepreneurs, executives, policy makers, and leaders of thought in the biotechnology industry. LSF's hosts timelines, transcripts and audio recordings and provides links to existing oral histories housed at institutions across the globe.\n\nOriginal documentary materials pertinent to the history of biotechnology and the life sciences are being collected. The materials include personal papers and correspondence, donated company records, laboratory notebooks, photographs, video and audio recordings. Collected materials will be guided to permanent repositories in appropriate institutional settings. Electronic reproductions will be made available to scholars, journalists, educators, and the general public in a digital archive.\n\nLSF historians work on a range of publications including a quarterly magazine, scholarly articles, white papers, and books. These works are intended for multiple audiences and focused on the emergence and evolution of biotechnologies in pharmaceutical discovery and development, agriculture, energy production, and environmental remediation. In October 2011, the University of Chicago Press released \"Genentech: The Beginnings of Biotech\" by Life Sciences Foundation historian Sally Smith Hughes.\n\nFounding partners of the Life Sciences Foundation include Burrill, Celgene, John Lechleiter, Genentech, Henri Termeer, Merck & Co., Millennium, Pfizer, Quintiles, and Thermo Fisher. MIT professor, Phillip Sharp, serves as LSF's academic advisor. Its executive and advisory board members are leaders from biotech, venture capital, academic institutions and trade associations.\n\nWhen Thackray retired in 2012, Heather R. Erickson, 34, was appointed as LSF President and CEO and member of the Board of Directors. Thackray remained as LSF advisor to its scholarly activities. The Board also includes Brook Byers of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in Menlo Park, California, Carl B. Feldbaum of Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) in Washington, DC who replaced Burrill, Frederick Frank of EVOLUTION Life Science Partners in New York, NY, Gillings in Durham, NC, Lechleiter in Indianapolis, IN, Scott Morrison from San Francisco, CA, Ivor Royston, MD, of Forward Ventures in San Diego, CA, Phillip Sharp from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA and Henri Termeer in Cambridge, MA. The first board of directors also included G. Steven Burrill, CEO of Burrill & Company— who also published The Journal of Life Sciences and Joshua Boger, former chairman and CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals.\n\n"}

PepsiCo's other drink brands, including Mountain Dew and Gatorade, also have a variety of famous spokespersons.\n\nCelebrities have been paid to advertise for Pepsi products.\n\nJoan Crawford was married to PepsiCo president Alfred Steele from 1955 to 1959 (his death), and was advertising executive and board of directors member from 1959 to 1973.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Joanie Sommers sang two popular commercial songs (\"It's Pepsi, for those who think young\" and \"Now you see it, now you don't, oh, Diet Pepsi\") for Pepsi-Cola that were run in commercials and for which she came to be often referred to as \"The Pepsi Girl\"\nin 1974 Joseph Nicoletti, then of Brooklyn N.Y. now music-film consultant, Laguna Beach, California, sung and produced the theme \"You're Drinking Diet Pepsi and it Shows.\" Hal Linden (Barney Miller) did the voice over and it was a BBD&O hit Commercial. Nicoletti was signed by legendary ad man Phil Dusenberry. Inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame, Dusenberry wrote the script \"The Natural.\" Dusenberry said Nicoletti was one of the best singing Voices in the business.\n\nIn 1984, Michael Jackson signed a contract with Pepsi that produced many commercials and world tours through 1993.\n\nDuring the 1989 Grammy Awards telecast, Pepsi and Puerto Rican singer Chayanne was featured in the first advertising spot in Spanish to be broadcast on national television without dubbing or subtitles.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Ray Charles was the star of a Diet Pepsi campaign called \"You Got the Right One, Baby,\" which was also known as \"Uh-huh.\"\n\nDuring the late 1990s the Spice Girls became the face of Pepsi with the tagline “Generation Next” inspired by their song Move Over from their album \"Spiceworld\". Promotion included TV commercials, CD singles for the promo single \"Step to Me\", and collectible cans and glasses with each Spice Girl on a different can or cup.\n\nIn 2001, Britney Spears became a spokesperson for Pepsi. During her contract Spears did many commercials including ones for the World Cup and other major events. Spears' contract concluded with an advertisement with Pink, Beyoncé Knowles, and Enrique Iglesias. The ad was made featuring the cover of the song \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen set in a Roman gladiator arena.\n\nIn 2004, Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and David Beckham all starred in a commercial for the brand together, featuring the two singers as assassin-like characters. \n\nIn 2005, Christina Aguilera was signed to promote the popular drink (she was previously promoting Coca-Cola in 2000). The campaign featuring Aguilera was released in 2006, but not in the United States. Some commercials featured singer Elissa, and some with Aguilera by herself. PepsiCo said in a recent interview that Christina Aguilera has that 'dare for more' approach. Aretha Franklin was also a spokesperson in 1998. And also in 1999 Janet Jackson signed on to the original \"Ask For More\" campaign which featured a song of the same name written and sung by Jackson.\n\nIn 2006, PepsiCo and Motorola launched the \"Cool Tones\" campaign. It involved Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige and The All American Rejects writing and performing ringtones that could be obtained by purchasing a Pepsi bottle. The artists also filmed commercials for the campaign in which they perform their original ringtones.\n\nIn 2012, Beyoncé was signed to promote Pepsi once again. This campaign will be her fifth for the soft drink since 2002 — and her face will be on a limited-edition line of soda cans. The multiyear campaign is estimated at $50 million, the bulk of it for media placements and promotions around the world, and the remainder split roughly equally between Beyoncé’s fee and what Pepsi calls a creative content development fund.\n\nNicki Minaj signed a promotional deal with Pepsi in February 2012. A commercial was released which includes her hit single, \"Moment 4 Life\", on Sunday, May 6 at approximately 6:06 pm.\n\nNASCAR driver Jeff Gordon is a spokesperson for Pepsi, and was sponsored by the company starting in 1997 as an associate sponsor, and sponsored Gordon in the Busch Series for two seasons. Since 2001, Pepsi has served as sponsor for Gordon in at least two races per season.\n\nIn 2013, New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and musical group One Direction co-starred in a Pepsi commercial.\n\nIn 2017, model and television personality Kendall Jenner starred in a commercial premiering the week of April 1 which caused much controversy over social media.\n\nFor the 1988 and 1989 seasons, Pepsi was the title sponsor of Suzuki's effort in motorcycle road racing's premier class, Grand Prix 500cc. The Pepsi livery was a new addition to grand prix motorcycling, and a change from tobacco sponsors.\n\nDuring 1988-9, Suzuki also produced a number of road going replicas of the GP bikes, emblazoned with the same Pepsi signage as the works bikes. Due to the livery's association with one of Suzuki's riders, the Texan, Kevin Schwantz, riders today are still producing their own replicas as tribute.\n\nIn 1998, the group Spice Girls have been spokeswomen in the international campaign. The ad was featuring the song \"Move Over (Generation Next)\".\n\nSince 2001, Sakis Rouvas has been a spokesperson in the Greek and Balkan campaign under contract with the headquarters of United Kingdom, being the only Greek artist to have ever been proposed to represent the brand.\n\nSince summer 2009, Inna is the spokeswoman in Romania, Moldova and secondly in Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia. She promoted Pepsi mostly in Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria through TV commercials and internet adverts. Some commercials have been translated from Romanian into Bulgarian or even Hungarian.\n\nIn Latin America, Colombian artists Shakira, and Juanes; Dominican Sammy Sosa, and Puerto Rican Daddy Yankee have promoted the soft drink. Spanish-speaking Jaci Velasquez did some commercials. In 2007 RBD promoted the drink in their home country of Mexico.\n\nAs for Asia, celebrity and singers Show Lo, Leslie Cheung, Jay Chou, Aaron Kwok, Jolin Tsai, Rain, Louis Koo, Nicholas Tse, F4, Faye Wong, Kelly Chan, Momo Wu, Bamboo Mañalac, Jericho Rosales, Jackson Wang, Daniel Padilla and Julia Barretto have appeared in several different advertisements.\n\nIn Pakistan, Pepsi sponsors the Pakistan cricket team and many Pakistani celebrities and personalities have been spokespersons for the brand including Hadiqa Kiani, Junaid Jamshed, Shoaib Akhtar, Bob Woolmer, Younus Khan, Kamran Akmal, Adnan Sami, Reema Khan, Call, and Vital Signs.\n\nIn India, Pepsi first used Aamir Khan, model turned actress Mahima Chaudhary and model and ex-Miss World Aishwariya Rai to promote its product. Later it used Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, Kajol, Rani Mukherjee, Saif Ali Khan, Fardeen Khan, Akshay Kumar, Shahid Kapoor (before he entered the movie world), Preity Zinta, John Abraham, Pawan Kalyan, Ram Charan Teja, Priyanka Chopra, and Kareena Kapoor as well as the national cricket team. Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone were signed for Pepsi's Youngistan campaign which targeted the youth.\n\nIn Australia, the trend has been to use local Australian celebrities to promote Pepsi including Kylie Minogue, Jennifer Hawkins (Miss Universe 2004), Holly Valance, Harry Kewell, Delta Goodrem, Mark Philippoussis and several others including New Zealander Sonny Bill Williams\n\nPepsi has had a notorious association with spokespersons, primarily popstars, over the last 25 years.\n\n"}

{"id": "237494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237494", "title": "Management information system", "text": "Management information system\n\nA management information system (MIS) is an information system used for decision-making, and for the coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of information in an organization; especially in a company.\n\nThe study of management information systems examines people and technology in an organizational context.\n\nIn a corporate setting, the ultimate goal of the use of a management information system is to increase the value and profits of the business.\n\nWhile it can be contested that the history of management information systems date as far back as companies using ledgers to keep track of accounting, the modern history of MIS can be divided into five \"eras\" originally identified by Kenneth C. Laudon and Jane Laudon in their seminal textbook \"Management Information Systems.\"\n\n\nThe \"first era\" (mainframe and minicomputer computing) was ruled by IBM and their mainframe computers for which they supplied both the hardware and software. These computers would often take up whole rooms and require teams to run them. As technology advanced, these computers were able to handle greater capacities and therefore reduce their cost. Smaller, more affordable minicomputers allowed larger businesses to run their own computing centers in-house / on-site / on-premises.\n\nThe \"second era\" (personal computers) began in 1965 as microprocessors started to compete with mainframes and minicomputers and accelerated the process of decentralizing computing power from large data centers to smaller offices. In the late 1970s, minicomputer technology gave way to personal computers and relatively low-cost computers were becoming mass market commodities, allowing businesses to provide their employees access to computing power that ten years before would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. This proliferation of computers created a ready market for interconnecting networks and the popularization of the Internet. (The first microprocessor — a four-bit device intended for a programmable calculator — was introduced in 1971 and microprocessor-based systems were not readily available for several years. The MITS Altair 8800 was the first commonly known microprocessor-based system, followed closely by the Apple I and II. It is arguable that the microprocessor-based system did not make significant inroads into minicomputer use until 1979, when VisiCalc prompted record sales of the Apple II on which it ran. The IBM PC introduced in 1981 was more broadly palatable to business, but its limitations gated its ability to challenge minicomputer systems until perhaps the late 1980s to early 1990s.)\n\nThe \"third era\" (client/server networks) arose as technological complexity increased, costs decreased, and the end-user (now the ordinary employee) required a system to share information with other employees within an enterprise. Computers on a common network shared information on a server. This lets thousands and even millions of people access data simultaneously on networks referred to as Intranets. \n\nThe \"fourth era\" (enterprise computing) enabled by high speed networks, consolidated the original department specific software applications into integrated software platforms referred to as enterprise software. This new platform tied all aspects of the business enterprise together offering rich information access encompassing the complete management structure.\n\nThe \"fifth era\" (cloud computing) is the latest and employs networking technology to deliver applications as well as data storage independent of the configuration, location, or nature of the hardware. This, along with high speed cellphone and Wi-Fi networks, has led to new levels of mobility in which managers may access the MIS remotely with laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.\n\nThe terms management information systems (MIS), information system (IS) , enterprise resource planning (ERP), computer science, electrical computer engineering, and information technology management (IT) are often confused. MIS is a hierarchical subset of information systems. MIS are more organization-focused narrowing in on leveraging information technology to increase business value. Computer science is more software-focused dealing with the applications that may be used in MIS. Electrical computer engineering is product-focused mainly dealing with the architecture behind computer systems. ERP software is a subset of MIS and IT management refers to the technical management of an IT department which may include MIS.\n\nWhile management information systems can be used by any and every level of management, the decision of which systems to implement generally falls upon the chief information officers (CIO) and chief technology officers (CTO). These officers are generally responsible for the overall technology strategy of an organization including evaluating how new technology can help their organization. They act as decision makers in the implementation process of new MIS.\n\nOnce decisions have been made, IT directors, including MIS directors, are in charge of the technical implementation of the system. They are also in charge of implementing the policies affecting the MIS (either new specific policies passed down by the CIOs or CTOs or policies that align the new systems with the organizations overall IT policy). It is also their role to ensure the availability of data and network services as well as the security of the data involved by coordinating IT activities.\n\nUpon implementation, the assigned users will have the appropriate access to relevant information. It is important to note that not everyone inputting data into MIS need necessarily be management level. It is common practice to have inputs to MIS be inputted by non-managerial employees though they rarely have access to the reports and decision support platforms offered by these systems.\n\nThe following are types of information systems used to create reports, extract data, and assist in the decision making processes of middle and operational level managers.\n\n\nThe following are some of the benefits that can be attained using MIS:\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was educated in the Sheboygan public schools and was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin (1901). For a number of year she taught English literature at the Sheboygan High School, and she was secretary of the Kohler Company from 1905 to 1909.\n\nKohler was instrumental in construction of the Waelderhaus in the Village of Kohler. It was designed by Austrian architect Kaspar Albrecht and was designed as a tribute to the tradition of Bregenzerwald (forest of Bregenz) Province of Vorarlberg, Austria.

{"id": "228061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=228061", "title": "Performance improvement", "text": "Performance improvement\n\nPerformance improvement is measuring the output of a particular business process or procedure, then modifying the process or procedure to increase the output, increase efficiency, or increase the effectiveness of the process or procedure. Performance improvement can be applied to either individual performance such as an athlete or organizational performance such as a racing team or a commercial business.\n\nIn organizational development, performance improvement is organizational change in which the managers and governing body of an organization put into place and manage a program which measures the current level of performance of the organization and then generates ideas for modifying organizational behavior and infrastructure which are put into place to achieve higher output. The primary goals of organizational improvement are to increase organizational effectiveness and efficiency to improve the ability of the organization to deliver goods and or services. A third area sometimes targeted for improvement is organizational efficacy, which involves the process of setting organizational goals and objectives.\n\nPerformance improvement at the operational or individual employee level usually involves processes such as statistical quality control. At the organizational level, performance improvement usually involves softer forms of measurement such as customer satisfaction surveys which are used to obtain qualitative information about performance from the viewpoint of customers.\n\nThe United States Coast Guard has published the \"Performance Improvement Guide (PIG)\", which describes various processes and tools for performance management at the individual and organizational levels.\n\nPerformance is a measure of the results achieved. Performance efficiency is the ratio between effort expended and results achieved. The difference between current performance and the theoretical performance limit is the performance improvement zone.\n\nAnother way to think of performance improvement is to see it as improvement in four potential areas. First are the resource input requirements (e.g., reduced working capital, material, replacement or reorder time, and set-up requirements). Second, is the THROUGHPUT requirements, often viewed as process efficiency; this is measured in terms of time, waste, and resource utilization. Third, OUTPUT requirements, often viewed from a cost/price, quality, functionality perspective. Fourth, OUTCOME requirements, did it end up making a difference.\n\nPerformance is an abstract concept and must be represented by concrete, measurable phenomena or events to be measured. Baseball athlete performance is abstract covering many different types of activities. Batting average is a concrete measure of a particular performance attribute for a particular game role, batting, for the game of baseball.\n\nPerformance assumes an actor of some kind but the actor could be an individual person or a group of people acting in concert. The performance platform is the infrastructure or devices used in the performance act.\n\nThere are two main ways to improve performance: improving the measured attribute by using the performance platform more effectively, or by improving the measured attribute by modifying the performance platform, which in turn allows a given level of use to be more effective in producing the desired output.\n\nFor instance, in several sports such as tennis and golf, there have been technological improvements in the apparatuses used in these sports. The improved apparatus in turn allows players to achieve better performance with no improvement in skill by purchasing new equipment. The apparatus, the golf club and golf ball or the tennis racket, provide the player with a higher theoretical performance limit.\n\nIn his study of innate human needs, renowned psychologist Abraham Maslow in his concept of a hierarchy of needs identified esteem and social fulfillment, garnered by recognition by family and peers, as a basic human need, and therefore able to be tied to structured programs that increase performance. Abraham Maslow, on “Third Force” psychology, combines aspects of behavioral, cognitive, and emotional psychology, and accounts for the impact of culture and society on behavior.\n\nIn business, human performance in sales, operations and employee engagement is able to be improved through psychologically rewarding experiences \"which can trigger a host of intrinsic human emotions and behavior as identified by Maslow. Including rewards in a performance improvement solution is a proven strategy to engage employees and align them with the company's goals. Awards can be cash or non-cash. Both stimulate human behavior. The addition of non-cash awards to the total rewards package creates a unique manner of unlocking the performance potential of people because it separates a reward from being used as or perceived as ordinary salary income. Non-cash awards break through the clutter to motivate higher achievement of and drive greater returns on investment. Cash as a reward can also be spent on day-to-day items like food or gas and does not create the increased \"psychological reward\" of achieving special items, or points to acquire items. By connecting with all levels of the organization, a complete rewards package can amplify performance across the organization and bring personal goals into alignment with organizational goals.\" Reward programs supporting improvement in sales and operations can be effectively paid for from the increase in revenue or profits which flow from the program, and without spending to reward for your current levels.\n\nThere is substantial evidence that monetary rewards are not effective outside the context of very rote work. In some cases, monetary incentive plans may decrease employee morale, as in Microsoft's stack-ranking system, where the total reward amount is fixed and employees are graded on an artificially fitted distribution\n\nPerformance improvement can occur at different levels:\n\nBusiness performance management and improvement can be thought of as a cycle:\n\n\n"}

As of May 2018, according to the \"Bloomberg Billionaires Index\", Kuok has an estimated net worth of $19.9 billion, making him the 48th richest person in the world.\n\nRobert Kuok is media-shy; most of his businesses are privately held by him or his family. Apart from a multitude of businesses in Malaysia, his companies have investments in many countries throughout Asia. His business interests range from sugarcane plantations \"(Perlis Plantations Bhd)\", sugar refineries, flour milling, animal feed, oil, mining, finance, hotel \"(Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts)\", property, trading, freight and publishing. His biggest source of wealth is a stake in Wilmar International, the world's largest listed palm oil trader company.\n\nKuok was born on 6 October 1923, in the sugar business. Kuok's father arrived in Malaya from Fujian, China, at the beginning of the 20th century, and Robert was the youngest of three brothers, born on 6 October 1923, in Johor Bahru. He grew up speaking his parents' Chinese Fuzhou dialect, English and Japanese during Japan's wartime occupation of Malaya. He was a student from Raffles Institution and English College Johore Bahru.\n\nHe claims he began in business as an office boy, and later started a business with relatives' support. Upon graduation, being a collaborationist with the Empire of Japan, he worked as a clerk in the rice-trading department of Japanese industrial conglomerate Mitsubishi Shoji Kaisha between the Japanese occupation period between 1942 and 1945, in Singapore, a conglomerate which with the help of Japanese military unit monopolized the rice trade in Malaya during the occupation period. He was soon promoted to head the rice-trading department. After the war, he took the skills he learned from the Japanese back to the family's business in Johor.\n\nKuok senior died in 1948, and Kuok and his two brothers and a cousin Kuok Hock Chin founded \"Kuok Brothers Sdn Bhd\" in 1949, trading agricultural commodities.

He was also instrumental in conveying information and setting up the meetings between Malaysia and China governments leading to full diplomatic cross recognition of the two countries.\n\nIn 2007, Kuok combined his plantations, edible oil and grains businesses with Wilmar International, hence making it the world's biggest palm-oil processor.\n\nOn 31 October 2009, PPB Group under the flagship of Robert Kuok issued a statement to the Bursa Malaysia that it had decided to dispose of its sugar units along with land used to cultivate sugar cane for RM 1.29 billion to FELDA. The sales resulted in a one-off gain for the company. The sugar unit and sugar cane plantation were the second largest business segment upon its grain and feed which were topping the sales.\n\nIn February 2014, Kuok's Singapore-based oil services company PACC Offshore Services Holdings (POSH) started pre-IPO talks with investors to list on the Singapore Stock Exchange to raise $400 million.\n\nKuok lives in Deep Water Bay on Hong Kong island.\n\nIn May 2018, Kuok was appointed to the Council of Eminent Persons along with Tun Daim Zainuddin, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Tan Sri Mohd Hassan Merican and Jomo Kwame Sundaram.\n\nRobert Kuok's brother, Philip Kuok Hock Khee was a former Malaysian Ambassador to Germany, Yugoslavia, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark.

In fact, Brazilian club Grêmio offered Assis' family a villa in order to keep the promising youngster with the club.\n\nPreviously, the family had lived in a wooden house in the middle of a \"favela\" or slum in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil. At this time, João (his father), a solderer by trade, often worked as a car park security guard at Grêmio's stadium in order to supplement his meager income.\n\nRoberto's success as a footballer helped his family leave the slots behind for a more comfortable home, but his hopes of playing top-level football with Grêmio were all but destroyed when he suffered a serious knee injury, which led him to play football in Switzerland. He played for Sion in 1992-1995 and 1996-1998. With Sion he won two Cups in 1995 and 1997 and became Swiss Champion that year. Then he went to stints in Japan and Mexico.\n\nYears later, Roberto's younger brother Ronaldo (now known only as Ronaldinho), would emerge as an even hotter talent at Grêmio's youth set-up before departing his home country for French side PSG and eventually Spanish club Barcelona, whom he was with for five years, before departing for Milan in 2008.\n\nToday, Assis acts as his brother's agent and adviser, and is credited by many, including Ronaldinho himself, as a major influence and guiding force of the player.\n\nDuring his acceptance speech after receiving the FIFA World Player of the Year award for a second consecutive year in December 2005, Ronaldinho paid tribute to his brother: \"He's my idol.

Machine shut-off nozzles serve as the connection between the plasticizing barrel (with reciprocating screw) and the mold. They are mounted on the machineside of the plastic injection molding process, unlike hot runner nozzles which are mounted on the moldside of the process. Machine shut-off nozzles differ from open nozzles because of their closable melt channel.\n\nShut-off nozzles are used to avoid drooling of the melt and stringing, as well as to feed with a retracted nozzle.\n\nShut-off nozzles can be self-controlled or externally controlled.\n\nThe needle keeps the nozzle orifice closed by spring pressure. When the injection pressure increases, the melt will push back on the needle head and try to open the nozzle. Once the melt inside the nozzle reaches a certain amount of pressure, it will succeed in pushing the needle back against the spring. There must, therefore, be a minimum pressure for the opening process to overcome the force of the spring. Once the nozzle opens, the pressure will drop again and the spring-operated needle will close the nozzle tip orifice.\n\nThe nozzle is opened by external force, independent of the melt-pressure. The shut-off nozzle’s actuation is hydraulically or pneumatically driven. Externally actuated shut-off nozzles can have different ways of closing the melt stream. Due to the fact that they operate independently of melt-pressure, they can be used for a range of applications such as melt pre-compression, physical and chemical foaming and high-speed injection molding.\n\nThe melt flow is shut off via a melt channel-axis positioned needle moving back and forth according to actuation. This nozzle type shuts off the melt stream directly at the nozzle orifice-mold interface which prevents drooling.\n\nA shut-off bolt, positioned perpendicular to the melt channel moves up and down according to actuation, and thus shuts off/opens the melt flow. This nozzle type has a single melt channel. It therefore does not require rerouting of the melt around the shut-off mechanism. This makes it more suitable for processing of large volumes as well as shear sensitive materials.\n\nThis nozzle type is fitted with a rotatable bolt assembly which has a cavity equal in size to the melt channel. In its open position, the bolt cavity is directly aligned with the melt stream. When the actuator rotates the bolt assembly, the cavity becomes misaligned and thus shuts of the melt flow.\n"}

It was established first as a publisher of trade publication, such as The Asian Banker Journal, before moving into research, consulting, benchmarking, and events organisation, all catering to the financial services industry.\n\nThe company's original product was The Asian Banker Journal, a quarterly publication of 40 pages that was launched in January 1997. Throughout 1997 and 1998, it provided on-the-ground coverage of the Asian financial crisis, anchored by Daniel's journalistic skills and award-winning articles—Daniel won the prestigious Citibank Excellence in Journalism Award for the Asian region in February 1999 for his work in determining the impact of the Internet on banking.\n\nThe magazine covers a wide range of industry topics, such as opinion editorials, current events analysis, retail banking, transaction banking, risk management, bank regulation and IT for financial services. It features profiles of individuals in the financial services industry, some of which can run to several pages if the individual is particularly influential.

The website contains interviews, 10 to 30 minutes in length, of prominent figures in banking, economics, IT, investing and academia.\n\nBy 2005, The Asian Banker Journal was published 10 times a year. While Daniel has turned over management of the magazine to staff, he still writes for a blog.\n\nThe company launched a forums division in 2000 to capitalise on the interest its readership had in taking part in a forum to discuss banking issues and challenges that had come to the fore in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. It held the first Asian Banker Summit in Singapore in 2000. Subsequent summits have been held in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Jakarta and Hanoi, Beijing and Singapore.\n\nThe Summit typically include fora on topics such as risk management, information technology, transaction banking, payment systems and regulation, and they include both opening, and closing, keynote speeches. Past keynote speakers include Al Gore (Summit 2005), William Seidman (Summit 2005–2007), Thomas Bliley (Summit 2006), Paul Keating (Summit 2007), Paul Sarbanes (Summit 2008), Kaspar Villiger (Summit 2008), Jeffrey Lacker (Summit 2009), Liu Mingkang (Summit 2009), Malcolm Knight (Summit 2009), Julie Dickson (Summit 2009), Neel Kashkari (Summit 2010), Richard Kovacevich (Summit 2012), and Thomas Hoenig (Summit 2013).\n\nIn The Asian Banker Summit 2008 in Hanoi and The Asian Banker Summit 2009 in Beijing, The Asian Banker collaborated with The Bankers' Association for Finance and Trade (BAFT) on a conference, held in conjunction with The Asian Banker Summit, called The BAFT Asia Conference on Cash, Treasury and Trade. On 27 October 2008, BAFT announced that it had renewed the agreement for the 2009 conference in Beijing.\n\nBesides the Summit, the company holds events in other cities around Asia.\n\nThe Asian Banker launched a research division in 2003. Asian Banker Research business compiles rankings, such as Asia Pacific banks by asset size and financial strength, CEO compensation, dividend payouts, the top 40 Islamic banking institutions in Asia, a databook of macro indicators of banking, payments and distribution, and industry performance. The division also writes management reports, research notes, country reports, and proprietary benchmarking on consumer banking technology and operations, and other topics.\n\nWhile The Asian Banker's research business covers a variety of research projects, its most visible product is The Asian Banker 300, a reference guide to the 300 largest banks in Asia Pacific by assets. The company expands the list to over 500 banks in its online version. The research comes out in September or October and is launched every year at Sibos, the large annual financial services convention organised by SWIFT. In the 2008 financial year, the 10 largest banks in the Asia Pacific region by assets were Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, Norinchukin Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and National Australia Bank. This has been unchanged since the previous years.\n\nSince 2003, the guide has added a strength ranking, which measures each of the 300 banks according to a strength formula. The formula weights assets, year-on-year growth in loans, year-on-year growth in deposits, and eight other criteria to arrive at a total strength score. Invariably, the largest banks are not necessarily the strongest banks, and in the 2009 financial year, the 10 strongest banks in the Asia Pacific region were HDFC Bank, Punjab National Bank, Public Bank, Bank of Nanjing, Bank Central Asia, China CITIC Bank, ANZ National Bank, Union Bank of India, Westpac Banking Corporation and China Construction Bank. The ranking is a recognised benchmark among financial institutions in Asia, and banks that have mentioned the ranking in their investor relations materials and financial reports include Siam Commercial Bank, Maybank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, DBS, Bumiputra-Commerce Holdings and Hang Seng Bank.\n\n"}

He was the leader of the opposition Group 24. He was shot and killed on 5 March 2015 in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nUmarali Izatovich Quvvatov was born on 21 November 1968 in the city of Dushanbe. He was married and had children.\n\nKuvvatov was a critic of Tajikistani president Emomalii Rahmon, accusing him of nepotism and corruption. He was a leader of the opposition Group 24, which he founded after going into exile in 2012. In October 2014 he publicly called on Tajikistanis to gather for a political protest on 10 October. However, no one showed up to the protests after Tajikistani authorities had blocked websites and deployed armored vehicles. The Supreme Court of Tajikistan ruled that Kuvvatov's Group 24 was an extremist movement and banned publications by it. Tajik authorities had blocked hundreds of websites after Group 24 used social media to call for an antigovernment protest in Dushanbe on 10 October 2014. Besides, a court in Dushanbe has sentenced Umedjon Solehov to 17 1/2 years in jail for his being a member of this opposition movement. Eurasianet reported that Kuvvatov was not widely known or liked before the failed protests, but that he became much more known afterwards.\n\nIn 2012 Kuvvatov went into exile to first Russia and later the United Arab Emirates after Tajikistan asked for his extradition. He was arrested in Dubai in September 2012 at the behest of Tajikistan. He was released in September 2013 after obtaining a pardon.\n\nKuvvatov went to Turkey, where he was arrested on 20 December 2014 on an alleged visa violation. His extradition was once more sought by Tajikistan, for extremism, economic crimes and hostage-taking. Turkey however refused extradition.\n\nAccording to Turkish media reports, conspirators planned his murder for three months. At first they wanted to poison Kuvvatov at the joint dinner on the night of 5 to 6 March 2015 in Istanbul. Then the killers used weapons and Kuvvatov was shot dead with a single bullet to his head when he got outside trying to reach the nearest hospital.\n\nRahmatullo Zoyirov, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Tajikistan, told RFE/RL's Tajik Service that Quvvatov's killing had been pre-planned. Quvvatov's wife, Kumriniso Hafizova, told RFE/RL on 8 March that she, her husband and their two sons had been invited for dinner at the house of Sulaimon Qayumov, a 30-year-old Tajik citizen. Qayumov has been living in Turkey for three months and positioned himself as a Quvvatov sympathizer. After dinner, Quvvatov and his family members felt sick and rushed out for fresh air. When they were outside, an unidentified Tajik-speaking man approached Quvvatov from behind, fired a single shot to his head and immediately fled the scene. The 47-year-old entrepreneur was already dead when medics arrived at the scene and police searched the area for evidence. Turkish media also reported that Mr Kuvatov's wife and children had symptoms of poisoning.\n\nSome observers have drawn parallels between the murder of Umarali Quvvatov and the late February assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. Speaking to journalists on 6 March, Muhiddin Kabiri, the leader of the opposition Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan, compared the killing to the recent deaths of Nemtsov and Rakhat Aliyev, the former son-in-law of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Rajabi Mirzo, an independent political analyst, described Quvvatov's death as a \"shameful and terrible event\" that could be compared with Nemtsov's killing. \"Nemtsov was killed the day before the announced rally, and Quvatov after the announcement of the [parliamentary] election results,\" he wrote.\n\n"}

{"id": "47504151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47504151", "title": "World Trade Center (2001–present)", "text": "World Trade Center (2001–present)\n\nThe World Trade Center is a mostly completed complex of buildings in Lower Manhattan, New York City, U.S., replacing the original seven World Trade Center buildings on the same site that were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. The site is being rebuilt with up to six new skyscrapers, four of which have been completed; a memorial and museum to those killed in the attacks; an elevated park adjacent to the site, called Liberty Park; and a transportation hub. The 104-story One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, is the lead building for the new complex.\n\nThe buildings are among many created by the World Trade Centers Association. The original World Trade Center featured the landmark Twin Towers, which opened in 1973, and were the tallest buildings in the world at their completion. They were destroyed on the morning of September 11, 2001, when al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the complex in a coordinated act of terrorism. The attacks on the World Trade Center killed 2,753 people. The resulting collapse of the World Trade Center caused structural failure in the surrounding buildings as well. The process of cleaning up and recovery at the World Trade Center site took eight months, after which rebuilding of the site commenced.\n\nAfter years of delay and controversy, reconstruction at the World Trade Center site started. The new complex includes One World Trade Center, 3 World Trade Center, 4 World Trade Center, 7 World Trade Center, and one other high-rise office building being planned at 2 World Trade Center. The new World Trade Center complex also includes a museum and memorial, and a transportation hub similar in size to Grand Central Terminal. 7 World Trade Center opened on May 23, 2006, making it the first of five skyscrapers to have been completed in the World Trade Center complex. 4 World Trade Center, the first building completed as part of the site's master plan, opened on November 12, 2013. The National September 11 Museum opened on May 21, 2014, and the memorial opened on September 11, 2011. One World Trade Center was opened on November 3, 2014. The World Trade Center Transportation Hub opened to the public on March 4, 2016, and 3 World Trade Center opened on June 11, 2018. 2 World Trade Center's full construction was placed on hold in 2009, with a new design announced in 2015.\n\nThe original World Trade Center featured the landmark Twin Towers, which opened on April 4, 1973, and were the tallest buildings in the world at their completion. The other buildings in the complex included the Marriott World Trade Center (3 WTC), 4 WTC, 5 WTC, 6 WTC, and 7 WTC. Despite high financial expectations for the original complex, it did not become profitable until the 1980s. On July 24, 2001, the Port Authority finalized an agreement that leased the complex to Larry Silverstein, who already owned 7 WTC. For $3.2 billion, Silverstein received the legal right to operate the complex and site for 99 years. At the time, the World Trade Center only had a few notable tenants, and Silverstein wanted to improve the complex to make it more attractive to potential tenants.\n\nThese plans for improvement were never realized. On the morning of September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda-affiliated hijackers flew two Boeing 767 jets into the Twin Towers in a coordinated act of terrorism. At 8:46 a.m. Eastern Time (ET), a team of five hijackers intentionally crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower. At 9:03 a.m. ET, a second team of five hijackers intentionally crashed United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern facade of the South Tower. After burning for 56 minutes, the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m. At 10:28 a.m., the North Tower collapsed, after burning for 102 minutes. The attacks on the World Trade Center killed 2,753 people. The resulting collapse caused structural failure in many of the surrounding buildings as well, and the entire complex was soon destroyed.\n\nThe process of cleaning up and recovery at the World Trade Center site continued 24 hours a day over a period of eight months. Debris was transported from the World Trade Center site to Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, where it was further sifted. Mayor Rudy Giuliani was tasked with coordinating the cleanup and recovery effort. On , 2002, a ceremony was held to officially mark the end of the cleanup efforts.\n\nIn 2002, ground was broken on construction of a new 7 World Trade Center building located just to the north of the main World Trade Center site. Since it was not part of the site master plan, the rebuilding of 7 World Trade Center was allowed to proceed without delay. While 7 World Trade Center was not part of the master plan, Silverstein and Con Edison recognized that the rebuilding of the tower would have to be consistent with the master plan anyway. The master plan called for reopening several streets that had been eliminated in the original complex, so the new 7 World Trade Center was designed so Greenwich Street, which had been blocked by the original 7 World Trade Center, could be continuous through the new complex. A temporary PATH station at the World Trade Center opened in , pending replacement by a permanent station designed by Santiago Calatrava.\n\nIn the months following the attacks, architects and urban planning experts held meetings and forums to discuss ideas for rebuilding the site. Outgoing Mayor Giuliani advocated for a \"soaring memorial\" to be the only thing at the World Trade Center site during his final speech as mayor. Meanwhile, Larry Silverstein wanted to construct a new World Trade Center as soon as possible: the insurance documents for his lease on the old World Trade Center had not been finalized at the time of the attacks, so he could not receive insurance benefits from the attacks unless he rebuilt all the office space that had been destroyed. George Pataki, the then-Governor of New York, controlled the Port Authority alongside the Governor of New Jersey and so was entitled to make the final decision regarding the site. He wished to balance the desires of people like Giuliani, who did not want any future development on the site, with those of people like Silverstein, who wanted a new World Trade Center as soon as possible. In January 2002, New York City art dealer Max Protetch solicited 50 concepts and renderings from artists and architects, which were put on exhibit in his art gallery in Chelsea.\n\nWith the World Trade Center site, numerous stakeholders were involved, including Silverstein and the Port Authority. In addition, the victims' families, people in the surrounding neighborhoods, and others wanted input. In November 2001, Governor Pataki established the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) as an official commission to oversee the rebuilding process. In order to bypass the approval of the New York State Assembly, Pataki left out Sheldon Silver, the State Assemblyman for the area, from the decision-making process regarding the LMDC. The LMDC coordinated federal assistance in the rebuilding process, and was tasked with working with the Port Authority, Larry Silverstein, and whoever was selected as the site's architects. The corporation also handled communication with the local community, businesses, the city of New York, and relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks. A 16-member board of directors, half appointed by the governor and half by the mayor of New York, governed the LMDC. The LMDC had questionable legal status regarding the restoration of the World Trade Center site, because the Port Authority owned most of the property and Larry Silverstein had the legal right to redevelop the World Trade Center. However, the LMDC, in an April 2002 articulation of its principles for action, asserted its role in revitalizing lower Manhattan.\n\nIn April 2002, the LMDC sent out requests for proposals to redesign the World Trade Center site to 24 Manhattan architecture firms, but then soon withdrew them. The following month, the LMDC selected Beyer Blinder Belle as planner for the redesign of the World Trade Center site. The new 7 World Trade Center, which was not part of the new plan, began construction on May 7, 2002. On July 16, 2002, Beyer Blinder Belle unveiled six concepts for redesigning the World Trade Center site. The roughly 5,000 New Yorkers that submitted feedback deemed all six designs to be \"poor\", so the LDMC announced a new international, open-design study. In an August 2002 press release, the LMDC announced a design study for the World Trade Center site. The following month, the LMDC, along with New York New Visions – a coalition of 21 architecture, engineering, planning, landscape architecture and design organizations – announced seven semifinalists. These architecture firms were then invited to compete to be the master plan architect for the World Trade Center:\n\nPeterson Littenberg, a small New York architecture firm, had been enlisted by the LMDC earlier that summer as a consultant, and was invited to participate as the seventh semifinalist. The seven semifinalists presented their entries to the public on December 18, 2002, at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center. Due to large public interest, NY1 broadcast the presentations on live TV. In the following weeks, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill withdrew its entry from the competition.\n\nDays before the announcement of the two finalists in February 2003, Larry Silverstein wrote to LMDC Chair John Whitehead to express his disapproval of all of the semifinalists' designs. As the Twin Towers' insurance money recipient, Silverstein claimed that he had the sole right to decide what would be built. He announced that he had already picked Skidmore, Owings & Merrill as his master planner for the site. On February 1, 2003, the LMDC selected two finalists, the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind, and planned on picking a single winner by the end of the month. Rafael Viñoly of the THINK Team and Studio Daniel Libeskind presented their designs to the LMDC, which selected the former design. Earlier the same day, however, Roland Betts, a member of the LMDC, had called a meeting and the corporation had agreed to vote for the THINK design before hearing the final presentations. Governor Pataki, who had originally commissioned the LMDC, intervened and overruled the LMDC's decision. On February 27, 2003, Studio Daniel Libeskind officially won the competition to be the master planner for the World Trade Center redesign.\n\nLibeskind's original proposal, titled Memory Foundations, underwent extensive revisions during collaboration with Larry Silverstein as well as from Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whom Silverstein hired. The plan was anchored by the One World Trade Center and featured a memorial and a number of other office towers. Out of the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition, a design by Michael Arad and Peter Walker titled \"Reflecting Absence\" was selected in .\n\nThough Libeskind designed the site, the individual buildings have been designed by different architects. While not all of Liebeskind's ideas were incorporated into the final design, his design and the public support it garnered did solidify the principle that the original footprints of the Twin Towers should be turned into a memorial and not be used for commercial purposes. As a result, Liebeskind's lawyers at the New York firm of Wachtell Lipton embarked on the multi-year negotiation process to frame a master plan for the rebuilding. The first step in this process, completed in 2003, was the \"swap\" in which Silverstein gave up his rights to the footprints of the Twin Towers so that they could become a memorial, and in exchange received the right to build five new office towers around the memorial. The \"swap\" and the ensuing negotiations, which lasted for many years, have been referred to as the most complex real estate transaction in human history because of the complexity of the issues involved, the many stakeholders, and the difficulty of reaching consensus.\n\nThere was much debate regarding the future of Ground Zero following the destruction of the World Trade Center. Disagreement and controversy regarding who owned the property and what would be built there hindered construction at the site for several years. Many wanted the Twin Towers to be rebuilt, but at a taller height than before. The project for the new Twin Towers was called Twin Towers II, which was led by an informal organization called the Twin Towers Alliance. Others did not want anything built there at all or wanted the entire site to become a memorial. Finally, a master plan was agreed upon, which would feature a memorial and museum where the original Twin Towers stood and six new skyscrapers surrounding it.\n\nThe social center of the old World Trade Center included a spectacular restaurant on the 107th floor, called Windows on the World, and its Greatest Bar in the World; these were tourist attractions in their own right, and a social gathering spot for people who worked in the towers. This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States, called \"Windows on the World Wine School\", run by wine personality Kevin Zraly. Despite numerous assurances that these local landmarks and global attractions would be rebuilt, the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild these WTC attractions, which has outraged some observers.\n\nAn episode of CBS's \"60 Minutes\" in 2010 focused on the lack of progress at Ground Zero, particularly on the lack of completion dates for a majority of the buildings, the main tower, One World Trade Center's having undergone three different designs, and the delays and monetary expense involved. Investor Larry Silverstein said the Port Authority's estimated completion date for the entire site was 2037, thirty-five years after work started. Although billions of dollars had already been spent on the project, he said Ground Zero \"is still a hole in the ground\". During an interview for the episode, Larry Silverstein said: \"I am the most frustrated person in the world...I'm seventy-eight years of age; I want to see this thing done in my lifetime\".\n\nOne World Trade Center itself was met with criticism early in its planning and construction stages. The original design, which was asymmetrical, significantly shorter, and called for an off-center spire, was met with much disapproval, causing a new one to be devised. A key feature of the final design, the fortified, windowless base, was also denounced as looking dreary and unwelcoming. To alleviate this problem, the designers decided to clad it with prismatic glass panels. The name change from \"Freedom Tower\" to \"One World Trade Center\" was met with some criticism. The then-Governor of New York, George Pataki, stated in 2003 that \"[t]he Freedom Tower isn't going to be One World Trade Center, it's going to be the Freedom Tower.\"\n\nThe design for the World Trade Center was finalized in 2004, but was revised extensively after the NYPD raised security concerns regarding various sites in the complex, which delayed the start of the construction of the entire complex by two years. The new plans for the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, which involved doubling the number of support columns, pushed back the construction timeline. In the original plan, the construction of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum would have begun after the Transportation Hub had been completed because the roof of the Transportation Hub provided the foundation on which the memorial rested upon and the walls of the museum. Due to the two-year delay and pressure by the victims' families to have the memorial completed by the 10-year anniversary, it was decided to concentrate on building the memorial and holding off construction of the transportation hub, which increased costs to an estimated $3.4 billion. A Performing Arts Center was also announced that year.\n\nIn 2006, the Port Authority took over One World Trade Center's ownership from Silverstein Properties. The project's developer Tishman Construction Corporation was the construction manager at the time. On March 13, 2006, workers arrived at the World Trade Center site to remove remaining debris and start surveying work. This marked the official start of construction of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, though not without controversy and concerns from some family members. In , the Port Authority and Larry Silverstein reached an agreement in which Silverstein ceded rights to develop Towers One and Five in exchange for financing with Liberty Bonds for Towers Two, Three, and Four. On , 2006, a ground-breaking ceremony was held for the Freedom Tower. The building was designed to be tall, the height of the original World Trade Center north tower, and its spire rises to the symbolic height of 1,776 feet (541 m), a reference to the year in which the United States Declaration of Independence was signed.\n\nIn May 2006, architects Richard Rogers and Fumihiko Maki were announced as the architects for 3 and 4 WTC, respectively. The final designs for 2, 3, and 4 WTC were unveiled on , 2006. Tower Two, or 200 Greenwich Street, was slated to have a roof height of and a tripod spire for a total of . 3 WTC, at 175 Greenwich Street, was to have a roof height of 1,155 feet (352 m) and a spire height reaching . 4 WTC, at 150 Greenwich Street, would have an overall height of . The new Trade Center opened on May 23, 2006, achieving LEED gold status and being the first tower in the complex to reopen. This had been considered a priority since restoring Con Edison's electrical substation in the building's lower floors was necessary to meet power demands of Lower Manhattan.\n\nOn , 2007, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced that JP Morgan Chase would build 5 WTC, a 42-story building that was occupied by the Deutsche Bank Building at the time. Kohn Pedersen Fox was selected as the architect for the building. Four renowned architects—including Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, who designed the transit hub; One WTC designer David Childs of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill; and the British architect Norman Foster of Foster and Partners, who designed Tower Two and masterminded the diamond design—would greatly enhance the street-level atmosphere of the rebuilt site. However, JPMorgan's March 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns caused construction on 5 WTC to stagnate, as the company changed its plans and relocated its headquarters to 383 Madison Avenue.\n\nGroundbreaking for 3 WTC occurred in fall 2008, and in May 2009, the Port Authority proposed reducing the tower to four stories. Work continued on One WTC, but digging the foundation and installing tower-foundation steel columns, concrete, and rebar for that tower took twice as long as it normally would due to the existence of the subway line under West Broadway nearby. The One WTC building reached grade level by 2010. From there, it progressed at a pace of one floor a week, Publisher Condé Nast agreed to move its headquarters to One World Trade Center in 2010, and with this shift, many more tenants were expected to move to the building.\n\nThe St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, which was destroyed during the 2001 attacks, was originally supposed to be relocated from the site, and on July 23, 2008, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reached a deal with the leaders of the church for the Port Authority to acquire the lot that the church occupied for $20 million, and relocate the church. Officials reneged in 2009, leading the Greek Orthodox Diocese of America to sue the Port Authority for failing to rebuild the church. On October 14, 2011, an agreement for the reconstruction of the church was signed that ended all legal action.\n\nBy August 2011, One World Trade Center was at 80 stories with glass up to the 54th floor, Tower Four was up around 38 stories with glass up to the 15th floor, and the former Deutsche Bank Building had been completely dismantled, and the Port Authority was working on their Vehicle Security Center. The memorial officially opened to relatives of the deceased on September 11, 2011, and to the general public on September 12. Construction on 5 WTC's foundation also began in September 2011. By December 2011, 2 WTC's foundations were finished and assembly of the frame was started. Because numerous American and Chinese companies were \"very interested\" in leasing space at the complex, 2 WTC was likely to be finished earlier than expected.\n\nIn January 2012, with Silverstein still unable to find tenants for 4 WTC, construction on the above-ground levels was delayed indefinitely, with plans for only 7 stories. Meanwhile One World Trade Center topped out in August 2012, and its spire was then shipped from Quebec to New York, with the first section of the spire being hoisted to the top of the tower on December 12, 2012. The September 11 Museum was supposed to open that year. However, construction was halted in December 2011 to September 2012 due to cost disputes, and further delays were caused when Hurricane Sandy significantly damaged the site in November 2012.\n\nSeveral of the towers reached significant milestones in 2013: for instance, One WTC's spire was installed from January 15 to May 10, 2013. Construction of 2 WTC up to street level was completed in mid-2013, with work on the rest of the building delayed until tenants for 2 WTC could be found. Work also progressed on 3 WTC's below-grade foundations and the ground-level podium, which was completed by October 2013. 4 WTC, meanwhile, opened in November 2013, making it the second tower on the site to open behind 7 World Trade Center, as well as the first building on the Port Authority property. The first tenants to move into 4 WTC were two government agencies. The foundation of 5 WTC was also completed by November 2013, although construction on the main structure stalled because of a lack of tenants. In early December 2013, Australian retail corporation Westfield announced that it would invest US$800 million for complete control of the retail space at the rebuilt center, with subsidiary Westfield Corporation buying out the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey’s 50 percent stake in the retail part of the World Trade Center site. Liberty Park, a new elevated park, also began construction in late 2013 when the Vehicle Security Center was completed. About $50 million was allocated to the park's construction by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in December 2013. \n\nThe September 11 Museum opened to victims' families on April 15, 2014, and to the general public six days later. Temporary fences were removed around the memorial. At the same time, the September 11 Memorial discontinued the requirement for tickets in order to enter the memorial, not only providing pedestrian access to the future towers, but also a path through the site to the Memorial Plaza and surrounding streets. 3 WTC's construction resumed in August 2014, with projected completion by 2018. In September 2014, it was announced that the original plans for the Performing Arts Center had been canceled; construction had been slated to start in December 2014. The St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church's ground blessing ceremony and symbolic laying of the cornerstone took place at Liberty Park in October 2014, with construction expected to be completed within two years. One WTC opened on November 3, 2014, and the first 170 employees of anchor tenant Conde Nast began their work there. In June 2015, the designers of 3 WTC scrapped plans for the rooftop spire in order to standardize the roofs with 2 and 4 WTC. The spire planned for 2 WTC was also canceled as part of a new plan for the tower.\n\nThe World Trade Center Transportation Hub formally opened on March 3, 2016, several years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. Liberty Park opened on June 29, 2016, while Westfield World Trade Center, located partially within the hub, opened with its first group of stores on August 16, 2016. The performing arts center was renamed that summer for billionaire businessman Ronald Perelman, who donated $75 million to the center, and on September 8, 2016, a design was revealed for the new center. 3 WTC was topped out in October 2016. On November 29, 2016, the St. Nicholas Church was ceremoniously topped out with a temporary cross.\n\nOn March 27, 2017, it was announced that construction on the Perelman Performing Arts Center would be delayed due to ongoing funding disputes. Construction on the center's underground parking garage began in August 2017, with the center itself expected to be built between 2018 and 2020. The same month, the Port Authority installed the iconic sculpture \"The Sphere\" within the park, overlooking its original location in the old World Trade Center. Previously, the damaged sculpture by Fritz Koenig had been located in Battery Park. On the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, a writer for \"Curbed New York\" said that although \"there is a World Trade Center again\", it was not finished: 3 WTC had yet to open; 2 and 5 WTC did not have definite completion dates; and the St. Nicholas Church and Performing Arts Center were still under construction. At the time, 3 WTC was slated to open in spring 2018, while the church was expected to open in November 2018. 3 WTC opened on June 11, 2018, becoming the fourth skyscraper at the site to be completed. The WTC Cortlandt subway station at Greenwich and Cortlandt Streets reopened on September 8, 2018, after being closed for nearly seventeen years following the September 11 attacks.\n\nFive towers, a 9/11 memorial and museum, a mall, a transportation hub, a parking lot, a park, a church, and a performing arts venue are to eventually occupy the new World Trade Center. As of June 2018, progress on the construction of the redesigned site was as follows:<section begin=\"construction\"/>\n<section end=\"construction\"/>\n\nOne World Trade Center (previously coined the \"Freedom Tower\" by Governor Pataki) is the centerpiece of Daniel Libeskind's design. The building rises to , the height of the original World Trade Center north tower, and its spire rises to the symbolic height of 1,776 feet (541 m). This height refers to 1776, the year in which the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. The tower was a collaboration between Studio Daniel Libeskind and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill architect David Childs. Childs acted as the design architect and project manager for the tower, and Daniel Libeskind collaborated on the concept and schematic design. The building opened on November 3, 2014.\n\n2 World Trade Center, also known as 200 Greenwich Street, was designed by Danish architect Bjarke Ingels. The building's gardens connect the adjacent neighborhood of Tribeca with the financial district at the World Trade Center. Construction of everything up to street level was completed in mid-2013, but the rest of the building has yet to be built until tenants for 2 WTC can be found.\n\n3 World Trade Center, located at 175 Greenwich Street, was designed by Richard Rogers Partnership. It stands across Greenwich Street from the Memorial's two reflecting pools. The below-grade foundations and the ground-level podium was completed by October 2013. After a two-year stoppage in above-ground construction, the tower project itself started in August 2014, and the building opened on June 11, 2018.\n\n4 World Trade Center, also known as 150 Greenwich Street, was designed by Maki and Associates. The building opened in November 2013, making it the second tower on the site to open behind 7 World Trade Center, as well as the first building on the Port Authority property.\n\n5 World Trade Center, which was supposed to stand on the site of the Deutsche Bank Building, was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox. Although the foundation was completed in 2013, construction on the main structure never commenced.\n\n7 World Trade Center stands off of Port Authority property. David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed the tower. The building is tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York. It opened on May 23, 2006, achieving LEED gold status and being the first tower in the complex to reopen.\n\n<section begin=\"memorial\"/>\nA memorial called \"Reflecting Absence\" honors the victims of the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The memorial, designed by Peter Walker and Israeli-American architect Michael Arad, consists of a field of trees interrupted by the footprints of the twin towers. Pools of water fill the footprints, underneath which sits a memorial space whose walls bear the names of the victims. The slurry wall, which holds back the Hudson River in the west and was an integral part of Libeskind's proposal, remains exposed. Walker and Arad were selected from more than 5,000 entrants in the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition in January 2004.\n\nOn October 12, 2004, the LMDC announced that Gehry Partners LLP and Snøhetta, an architectural firm from Norway, would design the site's performing arts and museum complexes, respectively, in the same area as the memorial. The Snøhetta-designed museum will act as a memorial museum and visitors' center, after family members of 9/11 victims objected to the building's original occupant, the International Freedom Center. The Ground Zero Museum Workshop is a privately run 501(c) nonprofit museum that is not connected to the official Ground Zero Memorial or Gehry's museum.<section end=\"memorial\"/>\n\nConstruction of the memorial was completed by early 2011. The memorial opened on September 11, 2011, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the attacks. The museum was initially scheduled to open on September 11, 2012, but was delayed due to financial disputes and again when Hurricane Sandy significantly damaged the site. The museum was opened in May 2014.\n\n<section begin=\"mall\"/>Westfield World Trade Center opened with its first group of stores on August 16, 2016. It has roughly of retail space, which once again makes it the largest shopping mall in Manhattan. Although the new mall is only spread over roughly one-half of the original mall's footprint (due to the new space required for the below-grade National September 11 Memorial & Museum), the mall is double-level, whereas the original mall was a single level. Three additional levels will exist above-grade on the lower floors of 2 and 3 World Trade Center, while 4 World Trade Center currently houses four above-grade levels. The World Trade Center station's headhouse, the Oculus, also houses a large amount of retail space.<section end=\"mall\"/>\n\n<section begin=\"hub\"/>\n\nSantiago Calatrava designed the World Trade Center Transportation Hub (its main asset being the PATH station) to replace the old World Trade Center station. The Transport Hub connects the PATH station to the WTC Cortlandt station (), the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal, the Brookfield Place, and One World Trade Center on the west; and the through the Fulton Center on the east. The new station, as well as the September 11 Memorial and Museum, is air-cooled via a heat exchanger fed by four pipes carrying water from the Hudson River. The cost for the transportation hub is estimated at $3.44 billion, a statistic that has seen much controversy given its greatly inflated cost.<section end=\"hub\"/> The hub formally opened on March 3, 2016, several years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.\n\n<section begin=\"pac\"/>\n\nThe World Trade Center's Performing Arts Center was announced in 2004, with the building to be designed by Gehry Partners LLP and Snøhetta. Gehry's performing arts complex was proposed to house only the Joyce Theater, as the Signature Theater Company dropped out due to space constraints and cost limitations. Construction was to begin in December 2014 when the removal of the temporary PATH station commenced. However, the original plans were shelved in September 2014. After a design was chosen in 2015, it was announced that Joshua Prince-Ramus was awarded the contract to design the building. In June 2016, the center was renamed after billionaire businessman Ronald Perelman, who donated $75 million to the center, and on September 8, 2016, a design was revealed for the new center. The underground parking garage started construction in 2017 and the center proper will begin construction in 2018, The center is planned to open in 2020.\n\nWhen completed, the Performing Arts Center will include approximately 90,000 square feet across three floors. The public floor will be located at street level, and will house a restaurant/bar to provide refreshments during show intermissions. The second floor will consist of rehearsal and dressing rooms for theater actors, and the third floor will house three distinguished theaters. All three theaters are designed so that the walls will be able to rotate and expand to provide extra space for a single theater if needed. The theaters will occupy approximately 1,200 people combined.<section end=\"pac\"/>\n\nLiberty Park, a new elevated park, was built on top of a parking complex named the Vehicular Security Center at the southwest corner of the site. Construction began in 2013 when the Vehicular Security Center was completed. About $50 million was allocated to the park's construction by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in December 2013. The park opened on June 29, 2016. On August 16, 2017, the Port Authority installed the iconic sculpture \"The Sphere\" within the park, overlooking its original location in the old World Trade Center. The St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church was originally supposed to be relocated, but the most recent plans call for the church to be built in Liberty Park.\n\n<section begin=\"park\"/>The park, measuring long and located at a height of , has a capacity of 750 people. A green wall is located on the Liberty Street facade. A walkway from the pedestrian bridge curves along the park; egresses include three stairways, the pedestrian bridge, and a straight ramp down to Greenwich Street. Of these exits, a wide staircase is located parallel to Greenwich Street and directly behind the church. There are wood benches and a small amphitheater-like elevated space at the West Street end of the park. Finally, there is an observation balcony along much of Liberty Street and another slightly curved balcony at the church's foot.<section end=\"park\"/>\n\n<section begin=\"fiterman\"/>\n\nThe original Fiterman Hall opened as an office building in 1959 and occupied a block bounded by Greenwich Street, Barclay Street, West Broadway, and Park Place. It was donated to BMCC in 1993 by Miles and Shirley Fiterman, for whom the building was subsequently named. In 2000, the State of New York Dormitory Authority, which owned the building, began a massive renovation to better adapt the building for classroom use. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, Fiterman Hall's structure was severely damaged by debris from the collapse of 7 World Trade Center. The renovation was never completed, and the building was condemned and demolished in 2008. After a series of delays, a new building designed by the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners broke ground in December 2009 and was completed in 2012.<section end=\"fiterman\"/>\n\nThe World Trade Center's new logo, revealed in August 2014, was designed by the firm Landor Associates and shaped like a \"W\". All the black bars, the empty spaces, and the \"W\" itself symbolizes something, giving the logo at least six meanings:\n\n\nLandor Associates was awarded a $3.57 million contract in 2013 for redesigns, which comprised \"the performance of professional services for the development and implementation of the World Trade Center (WTC) site-wide navigation, signage, and operational communications program\" and included the development of the new logo. Douglas Riccardi, the principal in the design firm Memo, stated, \"Its strength is its ability to be seen in many ways. You could never get more meaning in five little bars. The problem is that people may not bother to find out what the meanings are.\"\n\n"}
