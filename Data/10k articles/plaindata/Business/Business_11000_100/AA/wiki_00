The addition of adulterants is called adulteration. The most common reason for adulteration is the use by manufacturers of undeclared materials that are cheaper than the correct and declared ones. The adulterants may be harmful, or reduce the potency of the product, or they may be harmless.\n\nThe term \"contamination\" is usually used for the inclusion of unwanted substances due to accident or negligence rather than intent, and also for the introduction of unwanted substances after the product has been made. Adulteration therefore implies that the adulterant was introduced deliberately in the initial manufacturing process, or sometimes that it was present in the raw materials and should have been removed, but was not.\n\nAn adulterant is distinct from, for example, permitted food additives. There can be a fine line between adulterant and additive; chicory may be added to coffee to reduce the cost or achieve a desired flavour—this is adulteration if not declared, but may be stated on the label. Chalk was often added to bread flour; this reduces the cost and increases whiteness, but the calcium actually confers health benefits, and in modern bread a little chalk may be included as an additive for this reason.\n\nIn wartime adulterants have been added to make foodstuffs \"go further\" and prevent shortages. The German word \"ersatz\" is widely recognised from such practices during World War II. Such adulteration was sometimes deliberately hidden from the population to prevent loss of morale and propaganda reasons. Some goods considered luxurious in the Communist Bloc such as coffee were adulterated to make them affordable to the general population.\n\nAdulterants added to reduce the amount of expensive product in illicit drugs are called cutting agents. Deliberate addition of toxic adulterants to food or other products for human consumption is poisoning.\n\nPast and present examples of adulteration, some dangerous, include:\n\nHistorically, the use of adulterants has been common; sometimes dangerous substances have been used. In the United Kingdom up to the Victorian era, adulterants were common; for example, cheeses were sometimes colored with lead. Similar adulteration issues were seen in industry in the United States, during the 19th century. There is dispute over whether these practices declined primarily due to government regulation or to increased public awareness and concern over the practices.\n\nIn the early 21st century, cases of dangerous adulteration occurred in the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn some African countries, it is not uncommon for thieves to break electric transformers to steal transformer oil, which is then sold to the operators of roadside food stalls to be used for deep frying. When used for frying, it is reported that transformer oil lasts much longer than regular cooking oil. The downside of this misuse of the transformer oil is the threat to the health of the consumers, due to the presence of PCBs.\n\nAdulterant use was first investigated in 1820 by the German chemist Frederick Accum, who identified many toxic metal colorings in food and drink. His work antagonized food suppliers, and he was ultimately discredited by a scandal over his alleged mutilation of books of the Royal Institution library. The physician Arthur Hill Hassall conducted extensive studies in the early 1850s, which were published in \"The Lancet\" and led to the 1860 Food Adulteration Act and other legislation. John Postgate led a further campaign, leading to another Act of 1875, which forms the basis of the modern legislation and a system of public analysts who test for adulteration.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, industrialization in the United States led to a rise in adulteration which inspired some protest. Accounts of adulteration led the New York \"Evening Post\" to parody:\n<poem>\nMary had a little lamb,\nAnd when she saw it sicken,\nShe shipped it off to Packingtown,\nAnd now it's labeled chicken.</poem>\n\nHowever, even in the 18th century, people complained about adulteration in food:\"The bread I eat in London is a deleterious paste, mixed up with chalk, alum and bone ashes, insipid to the taste and destructive to the constitution. The good people are not ignorant of this adulteration; but they prefer it to wholesome bread, because it is whiter than the meal of corn [wheat]. Thus they sacrifice their taste and their health. . . to a most absurd gratification of a misjudged eye; and the miller or the baker is obliged to poison them and their families, in order to live by his profession.\" – Tobias Smollet, \"The Expedition of Humphry Clinker\" (1771)\n\n\n\n"}

D. A. Bagot\" was a South Australian adventurer, polemicist and politician active in the first half of the 20th Century, and related to Captain Charles Hervey Bagot.\n\nHis father, the Rev. E(dward) Arthur Bagot ( – 19 January 1930) of Kildoon, County Kildare, and mother had arrived in Adelaide on the \"Ormuz\" on 21 July 1891. Mrs Bagot had a daughter at 73 Hill Street, North Adelaide, and the son was born in Magill on Christmas Day, 1893. In 1894 they moved to Western Australia, where they had another son on 6 November 1895 at Cottesloe Beach and in 1899 returned to England, eventually retiring to Brighton.\n\nE. D. A. Bagot was educated at Framlingham and Lowestoft Colleges, in Suffolk, joined the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, assigned as second wireless operator to the \"S.S. Olympic\", and was on that ship when she received the fateful last broadcasts of her sister ship \"Titanic\".\n\nAt the outbreak of war in 1914 he was in Australia working for the Commonwealth Radio Service (later Postmaster-General's Department) at Alberton, South Australia. He applied for enlistment several times, and was finally accepted on 11 September 1916, and married Christobel Bollen on 20 September 1916. (Curiously, in his Army enlistment papers he gave his place of birth as Lowestoft, England.) He joined the Australian Imperial Forces as a lieutenant in the 1st Australian (Wireless) Signals Squadron, led by Major Charles William Marr, and left on the \"Karmala\" for the Middle East on 21 September 1916 and served in India and Mesopotamia, Mentioned in Despatches in 1918 (once not twice, and contrary to some references he was never awarded a DSO), promoted to captain on 1 October 1918 and returned to Australia on 14 April, his appointment terminating in Adelaide on 23 May 1919.\n\nAfter the war he spent another eight years organising tourist services between Iraq, Persia (now Iran) and Syria for the Mesopotamian Trading Agency of Ashar, Basrah. His wife may have joined him in 1924. He returned to South Australia in 1926 with the intention of setting up a regular service between Adelaide and Darwin via Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. He conducted a demonstration run with eight men and four women in three Studebaker cars and a Thornycroft truck, leaving Adelaide on 18 May and arrived in Darwin on 3 June; left there on 7 June and returned to Adelaide on 25 June, travelling via Camooweal, Queensland and Marree, South Australia, publicised by Duncan and Fraser (agents for both Thornycroft and Studebaker) and as they were equipped with a short-wave transceiver, gave nightly reports on radio 5CL. Despite a second successful round trip that year, Bagot abandoned his idea of regular service when the Commonwealth Government turned down his application for a subsidy. He found employment with General Motors and in 1930 \"Captain Bagot\" as he was called by admirers (or \"'Alphabetical Bagot' as he was known to the many who disliked him), founded the Citizens' League of South Australia, which opposed Unionism, Communism and the White Australia Policy as benefiting the working classes, yet also opposing Fascism. This was the time of the Great Depression and he also supported the Young People's Employment Council and the Rev. Samuel Forsyth's (1881–1960) Forsyth Industrial Colony \"Kuitpo Colony\" near Kuitpo Forest, which was training boys as farm workers. The Citizen's League attempted political influence by promising support to political candidates, and was a factor in the election of the Independent candidate George Connor to the Assembly seat of Alexandra in 1934.\n\nIn 1933 he founded Wannaway Options Limited, a gold-mining company with ten leases in Western Australia. A new company, New Milo Gold Mining, was set up to take over the options held by Wannaway which was voluntarily liquidated in August the same year.\n\nHe was a committee member of the S.P.C.A., one of many organisations supported by Mrs Alec Bagot. He founded the Australian Listeners' League in 1937, with the principal aim of having the Radio Listener's Licence fee halved from one guinea (£1.1s) to 10/6d.\n\nAfter several abortive attempts to enter parliament, he was elected to the Southern District seat on the South Australian Legislative Council in a by-election in 1938, largely on his stand against five year parliamentary terms.\n\nWhen not a full-time political operator, he was employed in the insurance industry in Adelaide then in 1943 moved to Broken Hill, from where he joined the Government Insurance Office of New South Wales. He was promoted and moved to Sydney, where amongst other duties he edited the in-house magazine \"Security\", retiring in 1963. and wrote a well-received biography of George S. Coppin. His wife was a close friend of Coppin's daughter Lucy.\n\nHe married Christobel Bollen on 20 September 1916. Her father, Dr. Christopher Bollen (29 July 1866 – 12 September 1952) of \"Clovelly\", Woodville Road, Woodville then Fitzroy, South Australia, was notable as having possibly the longest practising life of any Australian medical practitioner. Mrs Alec Bagot, as she was generally known, was a keen actor and was involved in many charitable organisations.\n\nThey had one son, Edward Christopher (5 January 1922 – 14 January 1944), who enlisted in the RAAF in March 1941, and left for England in September 1942 became a Pilot Officer, flying Lancaster bombers in the Pathfinder force for Bomber Command over Germany and was lost, reportedly when his plane crashed near Watenstedt in the Brunswick area. In the absence of evidence, his mother never abandoned hope of his survival and spent years searching for the facts surrounding his disappearance, to the discomfort of the Air Force's Missing, Research and Enquiry Service.\n\nTheir first home was \"Clovelly\", Woodville, South Australia then until 1937 \"Wellington House\", Wellington Square, North Adelaide; then 90 Jeffcott Street, North Adelaide (with a summer residence in Stirling West). Their Sydney home was initially at 104 Elizabeth Bay Road, Elizabeth Bay.\n\nInformation regarding E. D. A. Bagot's military service and E. C. Bagot's death and other details were obtained from the National Archives of Australia online.\n\n\n"}

Originally located in the old Bible House on Fourth Avenue’s famed “Book Row,” it moved to 114 East 59th Street in the 1930s and then moved next door to its current address in 1964 when the previous building was replaced with a skyscraper. Cohen’s wife, Ruth Shevin, managed the store’s art gallery into her 90s and worked with several other family members over the years. Now in its third generation of family ownership, the store is operated by Cohen’s three daughters and a grandson.\n\nSince its inception, the Argosy has worked with many prominent customers, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ordered books from an early catalogue, and later First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who needed help stocking the White House library with Americana. President Bill Clinton has been a \nregular customer ever since the owners restored his flood-damaged \ncollection of books in Chappaqua, New York. Other high-profile customers have included Michael Jackson, Stephen Sondheim, Princess Grace, Sally Field, Donatella Versace, Oriana Fallaci, and Kevin Rudd. Patti Smith was briefly an employee in 1967.\n\nIn October 2012 the Argosy suffered extensive damage during Hurricane Sandy, when bricks dislodged from the 32nd story of the adjacent building and crashed through the store’s roof. The resulting flood affected the top two floors and destroyed many historical artifacts, including acts of congress signed by Thomas Jefferson. The store made a full recovery by the fall of 2013.\n\nThe Argosy, known for its elegant old-world interior, has been used as a setting for movies and TV dramas, including \"The Front\" with Woody Allen, \"Law and Order\", and \"Person of Interest\".

{"id": "19555744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19555744", "title": "Asia (magazine)", "text": "Asia (magazine)\n\nAsia was an American magazine in the 1920s and 1930s that featured reporting about Asia and its people, including the Far East, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. From 1934 to 1946, it was edited by Richard J. Walsh, with extensive contributions from his wife, Pearl S. Buck. Under their influence, the journal published many prominent Asian literary and political figures and American authorities. In 1946, after many years of financial trouble, it was merged into a new journal, \"United Nations World\".\n\n\"Asia\" magazine was established by the American Asiatic Association in 1898 as \"Journal of the American Asiatic Association\". An editorial in the \"Journal\" explained: \"The ignorance of our people in regard to the countries of the Far East is unquestionably a serious obstacle to the legitimate extension of American influence. . In 1917 Willard Straight, who had been involved in promoting American trade and investment in Korea and China since the turn of the century, and his wife, Dorothy Payne Whitney Straight, bought the magazine and renamed it \"Asia\". and continued its publication as a popular journal of commerce and travel. The Straights also were co-founders of \"The New Republic\" magazine.\n\nWhen Willard Straight died of influenza in 1918, his widow took over publication of the magazine. She married Leonard K. Elmhirst in 1925. The editors included Louis D. Froelick and John Foord, and associate editors Gertrude Emerson and Marietta Neff. Elsie Weil, who joined the staff about 1920, was the long time managing editor.Frank H. McIntosh painted many of the covers.\n\nIn January 1934, although ownership remained unchanged, Richard J. Walsh, head of John Day publishers published his first issue as editor. He announced that the magazine would no longer be a tourist handbook, and despite objections from some readers, the magazine was shifted from advertising luxury goods, travel and promotion of American commerce in the Orient to discussion of international affairs and current Asian culture and literature. In the first editorial Walsh promised readers a wide range of topics and views. The magazine's political stance changed as well. Walsh wrote that it would \"look upon Communism as objectively as upon art, and bring to religious concepts as open a mind as we bring to economic problems.\" Walsh soon brought his new wife, Pearl S. Buck into the editorial process. \n\nIn the following years, Asia underwent revolution and war. Walsh, as publisher of John Day, and Buck, as America's most influential writer about Asia, attracted and recruited a new range of Asian and American writers, many of whom promoted an anti-colonial agenda, such as support for Indian independence, and anti-racist program. Subscriptions rose as Americans become more worried about the oncoming Second Sino-Japanese War. Writers included William Ernest Hocking, the Harvard liberal theologian; Hu Shih, leader of China's New Culture Movement; Owen Lattimore, the emerging authority on Central Asia; Lin Yutang; Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian independence leader; and reporters such as Nathaniel Peffer; Edgar Snow, Nym Wales, and Theodore H. White, who reported from the front line on China before World War II. Buck wrote a regular book review column titled “Asia Book Shelf.” The magazine recruited corresponding editors to gather articles, including Gertrude Emerson Sen in India and H.J. Timperley, an Australian journalist in China.\n\nIn 1941, Walsh and Buck bought the magazine from the Elmhirsts. They changed the name to \"Asia and the Americas\" in November 1942, and Buck assumed the editorship. She continued her attacks on imperialism, particularly British, and offered strong support for colonial independence movements. With the end of the war in 1945, however, Americans lost interest in Asia and the magazine suffered a financial crisis. Buck resigned as editor in 1947 merged the magazine with \"Free World\" and \"Inter-American\" to form a new journal,\"United Nations World\".\n\n\n"}

In many cases, the C&R regime for a given DRM is provided by the same company that sells the DRM solution. For example, RealNetworks Helix or Microsoft Windows Media DRM.\n\nHowever, for standardised DRM systems, it is fairly common for a separate body to be established to run the C&R regime.\n\nThe legal entity that establishes and maintains the regime. Usually this will be a joint venture or forum with representation from multiple companies, structured in such as way as to avoid accusations of antitrust violations. The nature of the business is that such bodies will generally be composed of manufacturers and content owners, with little or no direct representation from consumer advocates.\n\nThe C&R body is responsible for ensuring a chain of trust, such that the original content provider is sufficiently satisfied that their content will remain adequately secure throughout all future links in the chain. This may include export of content from one DRM system to another.\n\nTo meet this requirement, it is normal that any device planning to receive DRMed content is required to validate that it meets the C&R requirements, and this is usually done using a device certificate of some kind. The issuance of such certificates is the stamp of approval for both the manufacturer and the device.\n\nIf two devices can verify that they both have trusted certificates, they can then reasonably expect that content passed between them will remain secure.\n\nIn many cases there will be gaps, ambiguities or options left open in a DRM technical specification. The C&R regime must clarify exactly how a compliant device is to behave in these cases. For example, a compliance rule may define which other types of interfaces are acceptable on a device, something that the technical specification itself will never do.\n\nThe most controversial aspect of C&R is the agreement on how to ensure that a device is sufficiently robust at resisting attacks. These rules may require that certain elements are implemented only in hardware, or run on secure CPUs, or that the code must not be available as open source. Manufacturers then have to satisfy the C&R body that they meet this requirement before they are granted access to the certificates needed to establish their products as trusted.\n\nOne particular trick that is often used is to include some patented technology, often as part of the trust establishment mechanism. This means that anyone wanting to implement the DRM in a way that will work with others is forced to license these patents. A condition of obtaining such a license is to follow the rules of the C&R regime itself. Thus a C&R body has a 20-year window to pursue legal measures against a \"rogue\" implementation on the grounds of patent violation, rather than having to rely on a DMCA-style regulation provided by the relevant government. The need to license hook IP patents also impacts anyone thinking of building a product covered by the GPL.\n\nOne well-known example of a system employing such Hook IP is the DVB Common Scrambling Algorithm DVB-CSA, which though standardised by ETSI, includes patented elements that are only licensed to approved Conditional access systems vendors who agree to maintain the secrecy and integrity of the algorithm in their chip designs.\n\n"}

It typically involves direct contact with the brand's representatives, allowing for more direct interaction. Events are also a way to develop a relationship with media outlets, and work as an alternative for direct marketing. They may also be classified as an internal communication tool within a certain company. It should not be confused with event management, which is a process of organizing and conducting events while event marketing is a tool to promote brands or products with events.\n\nEvent marketing is also considered to be a part of experiential marketing and content marketing. Experiential marketing follows the process of corporate storytelling, and aims to further engage the audience. Experiential follows a simple formula of combining a brand's message and interactive components. This mode of marketing places the target audience in a live environment that will encourage the desired outcome.\n\nEvent marketing mostly relies on emotions and the activity of the human brain. Event marketing uses emotions and is based on the fact that people remember what they are experiencing. Emotional stimulus significantly affects the image of the offered service or product. Psychologists proved that while stimulated by emotions, the brain remembers certain facts and pieces of information better. Experiencing something makes it more memorable. In this condition, it is more likely that the brand will stay in the receiver's mind and create a long-lasting image.\n\nIn a thesis for the International Business and Economics Programme at the Luleå University of Technology, Jessica Eriksson and Anna Hjälmsson wrote:\nA completely different kind of event marketing is defined by B2B. The emotions involved are no longer a representation of the event, but rather, it is a possibility to make business contacts and networking which can only exist through a face-to-face meeting.\n\nEvent marketing was often misunderstood in the terms of its definition. The Cambridge Dictionary has two definitions for it:\n\n\nThe term itself became an important area of study in German, American, British, and Canadian markets. Event marketing had been considered equal to the promotion of an event in order to increase the sales of the tickets and was forgotten as a form of marketing.\n\nThis conception changed with excessive studies in the late-20th and early-21st century. Philip Kotler's \"Marketing\", which was published at the beginning of the century, is regarded as the first step to a clear definition of the term. It was later followed by a Danish publication \"Events as a strategic marketing tool\" written by Dorothe Gerritsen and Ronald van Olderen. Event marketing became recognized as a marketing tool, especially in Poland when it was introduced in the early 2000s. (Jaworowicz P., Jaworowicz M., Event marketing w Zintegrowanej Komunikacji Marketingowej, Warszawa 2016.) Polish academics mostly relied on Western studies and managed to build up the whole concept.\n\nRecently, event marketing has been gaining attention globally as its definition is acknowledged by a larger group of people.\n\nAccording to The US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the event industry will grow by 44% from 2010 to 2020. A plurality of marketers (31%) believe event marketing to be the single-most effective marketing channel, with 27% voting on Content Marketing, and 25% on Email Marketing.\n\nHubSpot has listed 11 experiential marketing campaigns from worldwide renowned brands like Facebook, Google, Zappos, and Guinness, who have hosted or created events as an innovative way of advertising a product. Each of them were successful and attracted thousands of new customers. Marketing Insider Group has also listed 5 event marketing examples that are still being talked about. Among them, The Kia Dream Chute is mentioned as one of the best ideas. All of those events are considered one of the best marketing campaigns in the world.\n\nA study made by Jack Morton Worldwide shows that 11 out of 14 consumers prefer to get to know new products or services by experiencing them personally.\n\nMoreover, 74% of consumers say that connecting with branded event marketing experiences is making them more likely to buy the products which are being promoted. That's a statistic from the report by The Event Marketing Institute and Mosaic.\n\nDue to the misunderstanding in regards to event marketing, its strategy has become recognized as a strategy of promoting a certain event. In the light of the right definition, event marketing strategy should be understood as a tailor-made plan to promote a brand/product with events as an advertising tool. The whole strategy should include an in-depth analysis of the plans of brand's presence on events. One of the only sources in this topic: eventory.cc highlights the importance of identifying the role in the event. This step includes answers whenever someone should actually participate in the event (conferences, fairs or exhibitors, participants), sponsor it or organize it. Such an analysis would take place while taking all other possible factors into the account. Further studies are required in this topic.\n\nIn order to measure the success of event marketing, the brand impact has to be verified. Based on Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) made in March 2006, engagement is \"turning on a prospect to a brand idea enhanced by the surrounding context\". There was also a function created to show the impact on a brand: \"Engagement + Trust x Targeted Group = Brand Impact.\"\n\nAccording to thebalance.com, events can be sorted out into nine different groups:\n\n\n"}

(formerly Hearst-Argyle Television) is a broadcasting company in the United States owned by Hearst Communications. From 1998 to mid-2009, the company traded its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"HTV.\"\n\nHearst-Argyle was formed in 1997 with the merger of Hearst Corporation's broadcasting division and stations owned by Argyle Television Holdings II, which is partially related to the company of the same name who (in 1994) sold its stations to New World Communications, stations that eventually became Fox-owned stations (Hearst itself, unusual for any American broadcast group, has never held a Fox affiliation on any of their stations). Hearst's involvement in broadcasting dates to the 1920s.\n\nIn terms of audience reach, Hearst is the third-largest group owner of ABC-affiliated stations, behind the E. W. Scripps Company and Sinclair Broadcast Group, and ahead of Tegna, Inc., and the second-largest group owner of NBC affiliates, behind Tegna.\n\nHearst-owned ABC affiliates in National Football League markets simulcast \"Monday Night Football\" games from ESPN that involve these teams - ESPN is 20% owned by Hearst, the rest being owned by ABC's parent, The Walt Disney Company. Other Hearst-owned stations also carry ESPN-aired NFL games, even though they are affiliated with other networks (like WBAL-TV, Baltimore's NBC affiliate). Hearst also holds some joint ventures for syndicated programming with NBCUniversal Television Distribution.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, the Hearst Corporation announced that it would purchase substantially all of the stock not held by Hearst. Hearst-Argyle Television then dropped \"Argyle\" from its name and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation.\n\nIn February 2009, Hearst-Argyle announced that its stations (except for KITV and its satellites in Hawaii, which had already completed their transition to digital, and WPTZ in Plattsburgh, New York and WNNE in Hartford, Vermont, which followed the other Champlain Valley in transitioning on February 17, 2009) would comply with the new DTV transition date of June 12, 2009.\n\nCurrently, Hearst owns a total of 34 overall television stations but considers two groups of four stations and an NBC station with an ABC digital subchannel joint operations, bringing their count down to 31 under that consideration: eleven NBC affiliates, fifteen ABC affiliates (one as a subchannel of an NBC affiliate, and one which acts as a two-station simulcast), two CBS affiliates, six CW affiliates (two traditional, two subchannel (which are part of a two-station simulcast), and two channel shares), two MyNetworkTV affiliates (one traditional, one subchannel), and one independent station. Most of the company's subchannel stations broadcast either Weigel Broadcasting's MeTV or NBC's Cozi TV through national affiliation deals, along with being charter carriers of Weigel's two newest concepts, Heroes & Icons and Movies!. Since December 1, 2014, Des Moines CBS affiliate KCCI has used their third subchannel as an H&I affiliate carrying MyNetworkTV programming in primetime. Hearst also owns two radio stations in Baltimore, the last remaining from the company divesting most of their radio assets after the Telecommunications Act of 1996 went into effect. As already mentioned above, none of Hearst's stations have ever held a Fox affiliation, with the exception of two WMUR translators in the northern part of New Hampshire dis-affiliating with the network upon Hearst's assumption of ownership of WMUR.\n\nSome Hearst-owned stations use the \"Commitment (Year)\" banner for all political news coverage leading up to the local, national, and statewide elections in lieu of a localized version of their associated network's political branding. This started in 2000. Hearst also maintains a Washington, D.C. bureau to assist their stations in coverage of national politics, including on-air reporters and facilities and equipment assistance for local stations. Many Hearst stations license the \"Operation High School\" branding for coverage of local high school sports. In 2007, Hearst-Argyle became one of the first television broadcasting groups to post their news stories on YouTube. WCVB, KCRA, WTAE, WBAL and WMUR were the first stations in Hearst-Argyle's station group to do this.\n\nUntil 2009, three of Hearst's television stations (KCWE, WMOR-TV, and WPBF) and its two radio stations (WBAL radio and WIYY) were owned by Hearst Broadcasting, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation through which Hearst ultimately controlled Hearst-Argyle Television, as opposed to Hearst-Argyle itself; Hearst-Argyle still operated these stations under a management services agreement. These stations were transferred to Hearst Television shortly after its privatization. Hearst's television and radio cluster in Baltimore additionally serves as the flagship stations and operation bases for the Baltimore Ravens radio and television networks.\n\nOn August 20, 2014, it was announced that Hearst Television would acquire WVTM in Birmingham, Alabama and WJCL in Savannah, Georgia from Media General, which divested those stations under FCC advisement as part of their acquisition of LIN Media.\n\nOn January 6, 2017, Hearst acquired majority control of Charleston, South Carolina-based syndicator Litton Entertainment, which has control of four of the five E/I-compliant Saturday morning blocks on the five major broadcast networks, along with being a syndicator of traditional programming. The deal closed on February 1.\n\nHearst Television also produces the weekly public-affairs program \"Matter of Fact with Soledad O'Brien\", which in fall 2018 entered its fourth season. Outside of the Hearst stations and A&E, the show is distributed in national broadcast syndication by Sony Pictures Television.\n\nStations are listed alphabetically by state and city of license.\n\nNote:\n\nOther Notes:\n\nNotes:\n\nIn addition to the above, Hearst-Argyle never owned WZZM or WGRZ. Those two stations were divested by one of the company's predecessors, Argyle Television Holdings II, several months prior to the merger with Hearst Broadcasting. The \"years owned\" information reflects the years of ownership by Argyle Television Holdings II. And WDTN was the only formerly owned television station that was owned directly by Hearst prior to the merger.\n"}

{"id": "31780978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31780978", "title": "High-density solids pump", "text": "High-density solids pump\n\nHigh-density solids pumps are hydrostatically operating machines which displace the medium being pumped and thus create a flow.\n\nHigh-density solids are mixtures of liquid and solid constituents; examples include farm grain, pulled pork, etc.. Each have their own typical physical and chemical characteristics such as specific weight, solids content, maximum particle size as well as how they behave, for example thixotropically, abrasively or adhesively.\n\nTypical examples for high-density solids are concrete, sludges and slurries.\n\nWithin industrial plants many substances with high proportion of solids - such as mechanically dewatered sewage sludges, filter cakes, bituminous coal sludges, waste and process sludges - have to be transported over relatively great distances to landfills or incineration plants.\n\nIn principle, long conveying distances can be bridged with mechanical conveying equipment or hydraulic high-density solids pumps.\n\nTypes of mechanical conveyors are belt, screw (worm), or scraper. They are suitable for nearly all types of high-density solids.\n\nHydraulic high-density solids pumps move sludges and slurries within an enclosed pipeline. However, not every sludge or slurry is pumpable, depending on:\n\nDepending on how the displacement principle is implemented, a distinction can be drawn between rotary and reciprocating pumps. The rotary circulation pumps includes eccentric screw pumps, centrifugal pumps, and squeezed tube (peristaltic) pumps. Reciprocating pumps include plunger, diaphragm, and piston pumps.\n\nThe high-density solids pumps which can be used in the widest range of situations is the hydraulically powered piston (or reciprocating) pump. It can be realized as single-cylinder or two-cylinder pump. In the latter case, power is transferred to the material via delivery pistons working in push-pull-mode.While one delivery piston sucks material from the feed hopper into the cylinder, the second piston simultaneously pushes the material in the other delivery cylinder and into the delivery line.\n\nThe PUMPMAN series pumps invented in INDIA in 2015-16 are however completely different from the presently available hydraulically operated piston pumps. The PUMPMAN series Pumps have been recently invented which do not use a hydraulic pump and complex hydraulic circuits for their operation. However they use a very simple mechanism which multiplies the reciprocating force several times without using a hydraulic system. These Pumps are protected under multiple patent applications, some of them are already published by the Indian Patent office. They have been invented by Amit & Anand Gokhale.\n\nThe most characteristic element of the transfer tube pump is the so-called \"S\" transfer tube installed inside the feed hopper. The job of the transfer tube is to control the flow of high-density solids - in other words, the pump cylinder which is currently pushing the material is connected to the delivery line by such tube. At (or nearby) the end of each piston stroke the S-shaped tube which is connected to the delivery line is swung over to the other delivery cylinder with the aid of two switch cylinders. A hydraulic circuit is used for synchronizing the position of the transfer tube and the movements of the two delivery pistons.\n\nThe S tube should swing over rapidly and not suffer undue wear. This is effected with two large-sized plunger cylinders and a so-called spectacle plate (so named from its shape) including seal rings.\n\nIn cross section the S-tube is circular with a diameter which tapers in the direction of flow. This keeps the risk of clogging down. The sealing faces of the spectacle plate and of the seal ring lie parallel with the swivelling movement of the S-tube, so that they cannot be damaged when foreign bodies are cut through or get stuck.\n\nThis pump does not need check valves.\n\nPiston pumps with S-tube are suitable for concrete and mortar, for sludges with a solids content of up to 50% by weight and a fluctuating particle size distribution but also for conveying fly ash, coal or minerals in a suspension.\n\nThe large cross section of the holes in the spectacle plate means that with a delivery cylinder diameter of e.g. it is possible to pump high-density solids with a mean grain size of as much as . The maximum diameter of individual foreign bodies may be as high as 60% of the diameter of the delivery line - in this example this would be .\n\nThe steel housing of the seat valve pump contains four hydraulically controlled seat valves, two suction and two delivery valves for the two hydraulic cylinders. The suction and discharge valves are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that the contents of the delivery cylinder is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the \"sucking\" piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened. If there is overpressure in the delivery line, the suction valve will close first. This prevents the pumped medium from being pushed out of the pressure line back into the hopper.\n\nThis pump does not need check valves.\n\nSeat valve pumps are suitable for an especially even pumping of media with a solids content of up to 50% and for the high-pressure pumping of paste-like industrial media such as sludges. Since valves are used in this two-cylinder pump it is suitable for grain sizes up to 8mm at most.\n\nWhich type of valve is selected will depend on the high-density solids to be conveyed. For materials containing grains with a solids content up to 50% a sharp-edged metal valve seat is required. With low-viscosity, rather watery fine sludges the choice would be a large-area elastomeric valve seal.\n\nIn one hydraulic control variant the valve is opened passively by the thrust of the medium. In this case the discharge valve has a non-return function which prevents flowback from the pressure line. At the same time the high-densitiy solids are precompacted to close to the line pressure before the discharge valve opens. This means that pipe knocking resulting from pressure pulsations can be avoided.\n\nDuring the suction stroke of the delivery piston the medium is sucked in via the open suction ball valve. At the same time the ball valve on the delivery line is pushed into the valve seating by the underpressure resulting from the suction (automatic valves). In parallel with this, the second delivery piston is making the pressure stroke and forces the medium through the discharge ball valve and into the delivery line. The suction ball valve is pushed into its seating by the delivery line pressure and thereby closes off the connection to pump intake.\n\nThe two-cylinder ball valve pump is suitable for in the low to middle pressure range for pumping highly liquid to paste-like media provided these can be sucked in through the valve openings - for example mortars, mineral and sewage sludges.\n\nThe ball valve pump is to all intents and purposes insensitive to corrosive and abrasive media since the ball valves do not have to be opened or closed from the outside.\n\nWith a single-cylinder piston pump the medium is \"stuffed\" out of a feed chute into the delivery cylinder and by the cylinder into the delivery line on the forward stroke. Depending on the level of the delivery pressure in the pipe and on the flow properties of the medium, the delivery flange of the pump will be fitted with a flat slide valve or a lamellar non-return valve in order to prevent flowback of the material on the return stroke. Which delivery piston is actually selected will depend on the material which is to be pumped: Free flowing media call for perturbane sealing elements while bulky materials which have to be chopped up during pumping mean that hardened cutting edges are required.\n\nThe single-cylinder pump is suitable for bulk materials with an awkward coarse composition - for example wood chips, organic waste, hazardous waste, or shredded paper. If such unsaturated material is to be conveyed over large distances, one possible approach is the hybrid feed system. Here compressed air is injected into the delivery line. It presses the plug of material into the pipe. As the compressed air expands the material being conveyed is loosened and separated. As distance increases from the air injection point, what was initially a series of plugs gradually turns into a continuous airborne stream. The amount of air required and the appropriate pipe diameter depend on the type and quantity of matter being conveyed.\n\nThe said type of gate valve is having a rotating member inside a rotating valve chamber wherein the center of the valve chamber is off-set with the center line of the pumping cylinder and the pumping cylinder and the delivery pipe are on the same axis. Further the value of the off-set decides the thickness of the rotating member's sealing portion as it is provided a cut section equivalent to the diameter of the pumping cylinder. This invention eliminates the through hole design of the rotary valve and also introduces a replaceable cutting edge for the rotating member. Further this valve ensures that it displaces minimum concrete during its operation and ensures elimination of dead zones. Further the symmetrical design of the rotating member & the valve chamber allow the end user to repair the valve by using conventional means of machining such as a normal lathe machine. This impossible with S-tube valve or rock valve. This valve has been invented by Amit and Anand Gokhale.\n\nMain parts are:\nand - depending on the type:\nas well as peripheral components such as:\n\nThe special kind of medium \"high-density solids\" and the wide range of applications require different construction principles and hence pump types. Following table permits a pre-selection depending on the media characteristics:\nThe hydraulic pumping of solids with high solids contents offers a range of possibilities in process engineering. Oil-hydraulically powered two-cylinder piston pumps with S-transfer tube have already been used for many years in civil engineering for transporting concrete. This technology has been transferred to further areas of application in various sectors of industry.\n\nMechanically dewatered sewage sludge can be pumped directly into furnaces via a pipe network. This avoids direct contact with the sludges and prevents from contamination and odour emission.\n\nHazardous and highly flammable substances are processed physically, chemically and biologically in order to reduce the waste materials. With the advantage of pipeline conveyance, high density solids pumps commonly transport such material.\n\nReal tunneling (in other words, not cut-and-cover) has increased palpably in recent years. Conveying mine water, soil and tailings to the tunnel entrance is a need.\n\nVarious aspects have to be considered in the planning and processing of conveying installations. This includes the space requirements, the accessibility in case of maintenance or cleaning purposes, as well as horizontal or vertical transport route for material discharge.\n\nDue to the nature of the material and the conveying method, odour nuisances is to be expected. Choosing the appropriate conveying method can reduce the environmental pollution\n\nThree forces have to be overcome when conveying with high density solids pumps:\n\nCalculation example:\nEnergy consumption = approx. per tonne of conveyed material and per kilometer (280 Btu per long ton or \n250 Btu per short ton per mile).\n\n\n"}

For twenty-six years she worked with Unilever, and since 1994 she has been a marketing consultant with Makki Makki.\n\nIndriati Iskak was born in Surabaya, East Java, on 9 June 1942. She is the daughter of Raden Iskak, an educator who transitioned to film in 1952, when he became the director of \"Penjelendup\" (\"Smuggler\").\n\nIndriati made her feature film debut in Usmar Ismail's \"Tiga Dara\" (\"Three Maidens\") in 1957, starring alongside Chitra Dewi and Mieke Wijaya. She portrayed Nenny, the youngest of three sisters raised by their grandmother after their mother's death. The film was a massive popular success, and Indriati, who was praised for having a more naturalistic acting style than her stage-trained fellow actors, saw the greatest popularity of her co-stars.\n\nThe following year Indriati appeared in another of Ismail's film, \"Sengketa\" (\"Conflict\", 1957). She again played the daughter in a family fraught with difficulties. After this film, Indriati completed two productions with Djuprihadi's Stupa Film, both under the direction of Wim Umboh: \"Djuara Sepatu Roda\" (\"Roller Skating Champion\", 1958) and \"Tiga Mawar\" (\"Three Roses\", 1959). With Rima Melati, , and Baby Huwae, she formed a girl group named the Baby Dolls in 1959.\n\nIndriati continued acting through 1963, when she made her last film, \"Daun Emas\" (\"Golden Leaves\"). It was directed by her father and co-starred her brother Boy. Indriati's popularity during the 1950s and 1960s has been credited with leading Indonesian film directors to seek out Indo-looking actresses for their films, and thus precipitating the careers of film stars such as Lydia Kandou, Meriam Bellina, and Tamara Bleszynski. Advertising for Perfini's \"Asrama Dara\" (\"Dormitory for Girls\"; 1958) touted its young star Suzzanna, an Indo girl from Bogor, as the next Indriati Iskak.\n\nAfter \"Daun Emas\", Indriati retired from acting and went to university, completing a degree in psychology at the University of Indonesia in 1968. After some time working at the Indonesian Air Force's psychological counselling bureau, in the 1970s she began working at Unilever.

He was a member of the Dudley–Winthrop family and married a member of the Astor family.\n\nJohn Winthrop Chanler was born in New York City on September 14, 1826, the only son of the Rev. Dr. John White Chanler, an Episcopalian clergyman, and Elizabeth Shirreff Winthrop. His mother was a great-great-granddaughter of Wait Winthrop and Joseph Dudley and a great-great-great granddaughter of Peter Stuyvesant.\n\nChanler received his early education from private tutors, and graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University in 1847. He attended the University of Heidelberg, studied law, and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1851.\n\nA Democrat affiliated with Tammany Hall, Chanler was member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 10th D.) in 1858 and 1859. He was nominated for New York State Senate in 1860 but declined.

The censure stemmed from a resolution he introduced expressing support for the vetoes of President Andrew Johnson, in which Chanler called acts of Congress vetoed by Johnson \"wicked and revolutionary,\" and called House members who overruled the vetoes \"malignant and mischievous.\"\n\nHe was defeated in his reelection to the 41st Congress for his hostility to Boss Tweed.\n\nAfter Tweed was overthrown from running Tammany Hall in 1871, Chanler became a Sachem and Chairman of the General Committee.

{"id": "17942527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17942527", "title": "Leopold Quarter", "text": "Leopold Quarter\n\nThe Leopold Quarter (, Dutch: ) is a quarter of Brussels, Belgium. Today the term is sometimes confused with European Quarter, as the area has come to be dominated by the institutions of the European Union and organisations dealing with them, although the two terms are not in fact the same, with the Leopold Quarter being a smaller more specific area. The Leopold Quarter was traditionally the area immediately south of the inner ring road, between the Porte de Namur and Porte de Louvain. Today it lies roughly between the ring road and Leopold Park, and Rue Joseph II/Jozef II Straat and Rue du Trone/Troonstraat. The district was created in 1837, named after King Leopold I, and covers the areas of the municipalities of the City of Brussels, Etterbeek, Ixelles and Saint-Josse-ten-Noode. The area was initially designed and built soon after Belgian independence in the 1830s and 40s and was a prestigious residential area for the elite of the new Belgian capital. It remained the most prestigious residential address in the capital until the early 20th century when many of its former residents began to relocate to Brussels' newly developing suburbs. Starting at that time, but accelerating rapidly only after the 1950s it became more and more a business/institutional area and is today dominated by facilities of the European Union.\n\nThe quarter contains the European Parliament (with its building known as the Espace Léopold) and other European Union offices. It is also a major financial district of Brussels. The Brussels-Luxembourg Station was formerly known as the Leopold Quarter station before undergoing major rebuilding.\n\nThe area south of the walls of Brussels was largely rural until the 19th century. In the last years of Austrian rule there were plans mooted to build a new residential district outside of the crowded city walls in the area that became the Leopold Quarter. When the walls were torn down in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars a plan was adopted to make the area formerly occupied by the walls into a boulevard, which is today the inner ring road of Brussels. In the wake of the Belgian Revolution in 1830, the new members of the Belgian upper class hoped to create a new prestigious residential area in the capital. An official plan for the quarter was drawn up by Tilman-Francois Suys in 1838. The area was designed to emanate from the Brussels Park located behind the palace. The area was laid out on a grid in a traditional classical pattern. The Leopold Quarter was quickly developed and already had 500 residents by 1847. By 1853 the population had reached 3,212, most property owners or landed gentry with domestic staff. Other typical residents included civil servants, military officers, members of liberal professions, embassy staff, and representatives of foreign companies.\n\nA railway station called \"Gare du Quartier Léopold\" was built, along with a large square at the end of Rue de Luxembourg, between 1854–55. The station is today known as Brussels-Luxembourg Station, while the square is still known as Luxembourg Square. They had not been included in Suys' original plans, as the railroad was a new development in the 1830s in Belgium. Designed by Gustave Saintenoy, the station and the railway came to be a defining feature of the area's geography. In those days the outer edge of the area was defined by the Maalbeek river valley, but in the 1850s plans were drawn up to build a bridge across it to connect Rue de la Loi to the new military parade ground on the Linthout Plateau (today Parc du Cinquantenaire).\n\nThe Eggevoorde Estate had dominated the Maalbeek Valley since the Middle Ages, but portions had been sold off in the intervening centuries. In 1851 a portion was sold off in exchange for shares in the Zoological and Horticultural Society, and the area became what is today the Leopold Park. The park was intended to be a home for scientific and leisure activities. Horticultural gardens and a zoo were created along with a community hall, reading room, and a cafe restaurant. However, the zoo was poorly managed and the management company went bankrupt in 1876. The horticultural gardens on the other hand were quite successfully managed by Jean Linden, and they became a commercial and scientific success story until 1898 when it was sold. Brussels bought the old Zoological gardens and it was converted into a public recreational park containing a variety of diversions, including the eventual Natural History Museum. In 1884 Ernest Solvay and Paul Héger, professors at the Université Libre de Bruxelles began a project to create an expanded university campus in the park. Several of the university's new institutes were created in the park, and stand to this day, including the original site of the Solvay Institute of Sociology.\n\nThe population of the area peaked around 1900. By 1930 the population had declined by 30%. Railway connections and then the rise in car ownership and allowed the wealthy residents to live further from the city in more open suburbs. The increasingly old fashioned mansions in the area, which were generally designed for use by families with the help of domestic servants became increasingly difficult to maintain. Property developers began to build apartments in the area in the 1920s and increasingly in the 1930s beginning a gradual change in its architectural character. Slowly at first, companies began to purchase unused mansions and adapt them to their use. Then after the Second World War several Insurance companies and colonial organizations began a trend toward demolishing the 19th century mansions and townhouses, and building new modern office blocks. With changes to the road infrastructure of the inner ring road for the 1958 World's Fair the area became even more attractive to companies, located between the administrative centre of Brussels and the residential suburbs further out. With the growing economy, and then the arrival of the European Institutions in the late 1950s, the area became a major target for property developers building office space for institutional and corporate use. Brussels had no development plan, and did not enforce existing legal restrictions, so most remaining residents left during this time as it had become completely transformed from a formerly quiet residential area into a congested centre of transport and business.\n\nIn 1987 the old Leopold brewery was torn down in anticipation of the construction of what would become Espace Léopold, which was unofficially intended to house the European Parliament. Political and legal wrangling had continually delayed a final conclusion regarding the unofficial seat for the parliament. However, as Brussels hoped to keep all of the official institutions in Europe, provision was made for the construction of a suitable facility. (See : Brussels and the European Union) The construction of the massive facility changed the face of the area again, putting the above ground railway tracks of the Leopold Quarter train station below ground and renaming it as the Brussels-Luxembourg station.\n\n\n"}

A March 2017 photograph of him sitting on his bed, smoking a pipe and listening to his wind-up record player in a rubble-strewn room has been widely reproduced.\n\nAnis studied medicine in Zaragoza, Spain, in the 1970s. His father was a wealthy textile dye entrepreneur.\n\nIn the 1970s, he was employed in Italy translating Fiat car manuals into Arabic. Later he went back to Syria and opened a cosmetics factory called \"Mila Robinson\".\n\nAnis states that his fascination with classic cars goes back to the 1950 Pontiac that his father drove, and which Anis still owns.\n\nHis first purchase was a 1947 Plymouth. His collection now includes dozens of cars from the 1940s and 1950s, and prior to the Syrian Civil War, he had hoped to open a museum in Syria. His favourite among his collection is a 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged, that he bought in a 2005 auction. He maintains that \"no car collection is complete without at least one Cadillac\", and his collection also includes a VW Thing, a 1955 Buick Super, a 1949 Hudson Commodore, a 1957 Mercury Montclair, a 1958 Chevrolet Apache, a cargo-van bodied Citroen 2CV, a 1947 Plymouth, as well as other vintage Buicks and Cadillacs.\n\nAnis's collection of classic cars reached some 30 vehicles, but has slowly dwindled during the war. In January 2016, he had 24 vintage cars, having lost six to shelling. To prevent theft of the cars, he removes the steering wheels and seats. During the conflict, his neighbours stopped rebels who wanted to mount an anti-aircraft gun on a 1958 Chevrolet.\n\nHe had to leave Aleppo for a time at the height of the Battle of Aleppo, and when he returned only 13 cars were left (including his 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged), seven having been impounded by the Syrian police, and 10 either missing or destroyed in the war. In March 2017, Anis estimated that altogether, one-third of the collection had been either destroyed or stolen. He says, \"When one of my cars is hit, it's as if I or one of my relatives has been hit. It's as if they were my children, so I come down to check on them\".\n\nAnis lives alone in the formerly rebel-held neighbourhood of al-Shaar in Aleppo, his family having fled due to the war. He has eight children with two wives, one in Aleppo, the other in Hama, and would like to leave his cars to his children, two to every boy, one to every girl. He speaks five languages, and likes to smoke a pipe while listening to classical music, and to Syrian singers such as Mohamed Dia al-Din.\n\n"}

Alongside Eastern Industries, Dangoor also ran factories producing matches and furniture.\n\nWith the founding of the State of Israel and the resulting conflict between Israel and the Arab states, the situation for Jews in the country worsened and in 1959 Dangoor took the difficult decision to take his family out. He continued travelling back and forth for business until 1963, when he decided that the worsening political situation made it too risky for him to return. As a result of laws specific to Jews, he lost his Iraqi citizenship, and his property and business interests were taken by the government. He was eventually permitted to settle in the UK where he set about rebuilding his life, setting up a property business that his four sons went on to join.\n\nIn November 1947, Dangoor married his cousin, Renée Dangoor (who had been crowned Miss Iraq earlier that year). They went on to have four sons.\n\nIn order to preserve the heritage of the community he had left behind, soon after settling in the UK, he founded a community centre in West Kensington for new Iraqi Jewish immigrants, and in 1971 began editing and publishing \"The Scribe – Journal of Babylonian Jewry\", with 4000 subscribers in 25 countries which continued to be published for 35 years.\n\nIn 1970 he revived the title of Exilarch – an ancient title held by the supreme leader of all the Jewish communities in Babylonia, up until the 13th Century.\n\nIn 2003 he demanded £12 billion ($20 billion) from Iraq's leaders as compensation for what the Iraqi-Jewish community had lost in Iraq after the Second World War.\n\nAs his business in the UK grew, he wanted to give back to the country that had taken him in. In 1980 he set up the Exilarch's Foundation, a charity that has made numerous donations to causes relating to education and health.\n\nIn 2004 he created the Dangoor Scholarships to help one thousand undergraduate students who had no family history of further education, at the 1994 Group of universities.\n\nA few years later in 2009 he created the Eliahou Dangoor Scholarships, in honour of his father. These were awarded to four thousand undergraduate students, with limited means, studying STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects.\n\nIn the same year Dangoor was made honorary President for the Association of Jewish Academics from Iraq.\n\nThe Exilarch's Foundation also sponsors the Westminster Academy in West London, whose pupils hail from over 60 countries, many in the Middle East. Dangoor's family have been closely involved with the running of the school and have seen it go from being issued with an Ofsted 'Notice to Improve' in 2009, to being rated as 'Outstanding' in 2013. Since the Academy opened the number of students achieving five A*-C GCSE grades including both English and Maths has increased from 17% to 70% in 2014.\n\nDangoor also donated a significant amount to Cancer Research UK to support their website, in memory of his late wife Renée, who died from breast cancer in 2008.\n\nAt Bar-Ilan University in Israel, Dangoor set up the Dangoor Centre for Personalised Medicine in the Galilee, which partners with hospitals to analyse the genetic makeup of individual patients, enabling doctors to implement the most effective treatments.\n\nIn 2014 he made the largest gift to the Royal Society of Medicine in its history. The donation is being used to help support young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who would like to pursue a career in medicine, as well as supporting the society's post-graduate education provision.\n\nDangoor was also the largest private individual donor to the Francis Crick Institute in London, Europe's largest biomedical research centre.\n\nDangoor Walk, a pathway that runs beside the Francis Crick Institute and links Midland Road with Ossulton Street, is named after him.\n\nThrough his foundation Dangoor promoted the idea of 'Universal Monotheism' a concept that he believes can bring about unity and create a framework for a global religious ethic. He has sponsored the setting up of a centre for Universal Monotheism at Bar-Ilan University from which he received an honorary doctorate in 2006.\n\nHe made contributions to the University of Nanjing in China, and had a particular interest in China because his late wife Renée was born and grew up in Shanghai. In Nanjing he funded scholarships for the university's Jewish Studies Institute and sponsored an international symposium on monotheism, attended by delegates from all over China, the US, Australia and Israel. In 2011 he was made a consultant professor of the University of Nanjing in recognition of his contributions.\n\nHe received an OBE in 2006, a CBE in the 2012 New Year's Honours List, and was made a Knight Bachelor in the Queen's 2015 birthday honours list. He became the second-oldest person to be knighted, and the oldest to be knighted for the first time – Robert Mayer was 101 when he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, but he had already been made a Knight Bachelor at the age of 60.\n\nIn 2012 Dangoor was made a fellow of Birkbeck College, part of the University of London. This was in addition to his honorary fellowship of the Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences, awarded in 2007.\n\nIn April 2015, to mark his birthday, Coca-Cola published a piece on the first Coca-Cola bottler of Iraq sharing a centenary with the iconic Coca-Cola bottle.\n"}

{"id": "15603168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15603168", "title": "Place management", "text": "Place management\n\nPlace management is the process of making places better. This is practiced through programmes to improve a location or to maintain an already attained desired standard of operation. Place management can be undertaken by private, public or voluntary organisations or a mixture of each. Despite the wide variety of place management initiatives the underlying common factor is usually a desire to maximise the effectiveness of a location for its users, whether they are residents, shoppers, tourists, investors, property developers or business owners.\n\nPlace management is defined by the Institute of Place Management as \"a coordinated, area-based, multi-stakeholder approach to improve locations, harnessing the skills, experiences and resources of those in the private, public and voluntary sectors\". However, as a conceptual field it remains relatively underdeveloped because of its infancy.\n\nPlace management has its roots in the management of towns, cities, neighbourhoods and other locations. The reasons for the need for place management are compelling. The proportion of the world’s population living in cities has grown from 13% in 1900 to nearly 50% now. Changes particularly in healthcare and technology have led to dramatic shifts in migration practices. Fluctuations in the movement of people places a strain on both urban and rural locations.\n\nMigration is not limited between rural and urban locations but can also happen between countries, creating issues relating to cultural integration. People will migrate for numerous reasons often linked with finding a better quality of life either through superior employment prospects, escaping war or poverty, or even to enjoy a better climate. This can create problems for locations which become exposed to increases in population, decreases in population, or a shift in the demographic composition of a population. Places subsequently act as focal points for the occurrence of phenomena such as globalisation and the clash of civilisations.\n\nFactors such as changing technology not only drive migration, but can in themselves trouble the prosperity of places. Technological development was a driver behind the Industrial Revolution which led to high levels of migration into urban locations. However, further technological development rendered many of the primary functions of successful industrial cities as obsolete towards the end of the twentieth century. Grimond cites New York City as being one city which “went through a bad patch in the 1970s” while other major cities, such as Manchester in the UK which is famed for instigating the Industrial Revolution, also suffered. Rapid technological and industrial change not only creates jobs but can also cause mass unemployment, damaging local economies and leaving pockets of deprivation across regions.\n\nAnother important factor in the development of the field of place management is the impact of the retail sector. As a non-judicial parliamentary review of the UK retail sector states, retailing is a necessity for local populations, supplying food and goods in the absence of self agricultural practices. However, shifts in the sector influenced by national and multi-national companies have led to the globalisation of the sector, which raises concerns about the sustainability of the supply of goods and the effectiveness of local economies. Furthermore, all business practices, either positively or negatively, can impact upon the prosperity of the area it is based through the employment of people, investment and skills retention.\n\nAs it now appears to be accepted that for numerous reasons places undergo a process evolution which can impact upon their prosperity, it has become more widely acknowledged that deliberate and co-ordinated intervention in this evolution is desirable. Recognising a symbiotic relationship between the prosperity of a location and the prosperity of retail, firms Boots the Chemist, J Sainsburys and Marks & Spencer in the UK contributed to the development of place management by supporting local authorities in the formation of locally based intervention schemes. This led to the appointments of the United Kingdom's first town centre managers in Ilford and the London Borough of Redbridge in 1987. This consequently led to the formation of the Association of Town Centre Management. Between 1987 and 2000 around 500 town centre management schemes covering 600 towns and cities dedicated to co-ordinating various functions of a particular location have been established.\n\nSince the 1970s and 1980s, similar intervention schemes were practiced elsewhere under different guises including urban revitalisation in Poland, activity centre management in Australia, and business improvement districts in the US. Despite their differences, as they each embody the aim of improving the effectiveness of a location, the Institute of Place Management has sought to unify them under the banner of ‘place management’ borrowing a term which was originally conceived in Australia.\n\nPlace management has existed for over 20 years in a variety of forms. It is encompassed within the practice of acts including town centre management, urban revitalisation, activity centre management, regeneration, management, marketing, economic development, neighbourhood management, neighbourhood renewal, socio-economic revitalisation, community development and business improvement district management. However, there exist questions about the practical nature of place management because no clear consensus has yet been developed.\n\nQuestions include both the positive and normative aspects of place management. The overwhelming amount of variables which impact upon the effectiveness of a location in serving the needs of its users makes it difficult to determine if place management is being practised in a particular location, how it is being practiced and how it should be practiced. A mixture of cultural, societal, demographic, economic, religious, political, legal and technological issues may all play a role. This is problematic for both the academic and the practical determination of place management.\n\nAlthough this term is relatively new, place management has, in practice, become an established concept over the last twenty years in Europe, having existed in parts of North America for much longer. It is also an emerging concept in other parts of the world such as Asia and Australia. The concept embraces management of a wide range of locations, which may include public and private spaces of various sizes and geographical spaces. Consequently, place management can take a number of forms. Initiatives can be differentiated by the origins of the resources which support it and the degree of formality which underpins the agreement to secure resources from the various funding bodies.\n\nOne example is a community-based (bottom-up) approach, where communities or businesses take the initiative of improving their street, town centre, public park or engage actively with NGOs and the voluntary sector. Among many other examples, this approach has been trialled successfully since 1995 by an association of independent retailers in Granollers, Spain where a not-for-profit association was formed which aimed to enhance the local area for residents and consumers, investing revenue in improvements and charitable causes. This demonstrates an informal place management initiative.\n\nA business improvement district (BID) is a predominantly private partnership (although it can also encompass some public resources) in which businesses in a defined area elect to pay an additional tax in order to fund improvements to the district's public realm and trading environment. These businesses hope to see a return on their investment through an increase in customer spend within the location. The concept of the BID is believed to have been developed in Canada before spreading to the US and across the globe. Unlike the Granollers example, as a BID is a formal place management initiative because it acts as an additional tax which is legally recognised in many of the areas in which they have been set up.\n\nContrary to the ‘bottom-up’ approach, many place management schemes have been initially formed publicly by local government, which has provided funding to create the post of a place manager. Local government is often seen as a natural home for place management initiatives, as its remit will be to obtain a desired standard of living for its residents. However, the additional financial burden or a lack of place management expertise can hamper efforts to locate place management initiatives with local government.\n"}

In roll bonding, two or more layers of different metals are passed through a pair of flat rollers under sufficient pressure to bond the layers. The pressure is high enough to deform the metals and reduce the combined thickness of the clad material. The mating surfaces must be previously prepared (scratched, cleaned, degreased) in order to increase their friction coefficient and remove any oxide layers.\nThe process can be performed at room temperature or at warm conditions. In warm roll bonding, heat is applied to pre-heat the sheets just before rolling, in order to increase their ductility and improve the strength of the weld. The strength of the rolled bonds depends on the main process parameters, including the rolling conditions (entry temperature of the sheets, amount of thickness reduction, rolling speed, etc.), the pre-rolling treatment conditions (annealing temperature and time, surface preparation techniques, etc.) and the post-rolling heat treatments.\n\nThe applications of roll bonding can be used for cladding of metal sheets, or as a sub-step of the accumulative roll bonding. Bonding of the sheets can be controlled by painting a pattern on one sheet; only the bare metal surfaces bond, and the un-bonded portion can be inflated if the sheet is heated and the coating vaporizes. This is used to make heat exchangers for refrigeration equipment. \n"}

VALS is a way of viewing people on the basis of their attitudes, needs, wants, beliefs and demographics. By using psychology to analyze and predict consumer preferences and choices, the VALS system constructs a link between personality traits and buying behavior.The system identifies current and future opportunities by segmenting the consumer market place on the basis of the personality traits that drive consumer behavior\n\nVALS was developed in 1978 by social scientist and consumer futurist Arnold Mitchell and his colleagues at SRI International. It was immediately embraced by advertising agencies and is currently offered as a product of SRI's consulting services division. VALS draws heavily on the work of Harvard sociologist David Riesman and psychologist Abraham Maslow.\n\nMitchell used statistics to identify attitudinal and demographic questions that helped categorize adult American consumers into one of nine lifestyle types: survivors (4%), sustainers (7%), belongers (35%), emulators (9%), achievers (22%), I-am-me (5%), experiential (7%), societally conscious (9%), and integrated (2%). The questions were weighted using data developed from a sample of 1,635 Americans and their significant others, who responded to an SRI International survey in 1980.\n\nThe main dimensions of the VALS framework are resources (the vertical dimension) and primary motivation (the horizontal dimension). The vertical dimension segments people based on the degree to which they are innovative and have resources such as income, education, self-confidence, intelligence, leadership skills, and energy. The horizontal dimension represents primary motivations and includes three distinct types:\n\n\nAt the top of the rectangle are the Innovators, who have such high resources that they could have any of the three primary motivations. At the bottom of the rectangle are the Survivors, who live complacently and within their means without a strong primary motivation of the types listed above. The VALS Framework gives more details about each of the groups.\n\nResearchers faced some problems with the VALS method, and in response, SRI developed the VALS2 programme in 1978; additionally, SRI significantly revised it in 1989. VALS2 places less emphasis on activities and interests and more on a psychological base to tap relatively enduring attitudes and values. The VALS2 program has two dimensions. The first dimension, Self-orientation, determines the type of goals and behaviours that individuals will pursue, and refers to patterns of attitudes and activities which help individuals reinforce, sustain, or modify their social self-image. This is a fundamental human need. \n\nThe second dimension, Resources, reflects the ability of individuals to pursue their dominant self-orientation and includes full-range of physical, psychological, demographic, and material means such as self-confidence, interpersonal skills, inventiveness, intelligence, eagerness to buy, money, position, education, etc. According to VALS 2, a consumer purchases certain products and services because the individual is a specific type of person. The purchase is believed to reflect a consumer’s lifestyle, which is a function of self–orientation and resources. \n\nIn 1991, the name VALS2 was switched back to VALS, because of brand equity. \n\nPsychographic segmentation has been criticized by well-known public opinion analyst and social scientist Daniel Yankelovich, who says psychographics are \"very weak\" at predicting people's purchases, making it a \"very poor\" tool for corporate decision-makers. \n\nThe VALS Framework has also been criticized as too culturally specific for international use. \n\nThe following types correspond to VALS segments of US adults based on two concepts for understanding consumers: primary motivation and resources.\n\n\nThere is little to no evidence of the use of this framework on a wide basis by any other industry other than the ad industry as indicated by SRI on what little it shares on its website (go to the SRI website for more info).\n\n\n\n"}
