{"id": "376998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=376998", "title": "American system of manufacturing", "text": "American system of manufacturing\n\nThe American system of manufacturing was a set of manufacturing methods that evolved in the 19th century. The two notable features were the extensive use of interchangeable parts and mechanization for production, which resulted in more efficient use of labor compared to hand methods. The system was also known as armory practice because it was first fully developed in armories, namely, the United States Armories at Springfield in Massachusetts and Harpers Ferry in Virginia (later West Virginia), inside contractors to supply the United States Armed Forces, and various private armories. The name \"American system\" came not from any aspect of the system that is unique to the American national character, but simply from the fact that for a time in the 19th century it was strongly associated with the American companies who first successfully implemented it, and how their methods contrasted (at that time) with those of British and continental European companies. In the 1850s, the \"American system\" was contrasted to the British factory system which had evolved over the previous century. Within a few decades, manufacturing technology had evolved further, and the ideas behind the \"American\" system were in use worldwide. Therefore, in manufacturing today, which is global in the scope of its methods, there is no longer any such distinction.\n\nThe American system involved semi-skilled labor using machine tools and jigs to make standardized, identical, interchangeable parts, manufactured to a tolerance, which could be assembled with a minimum of time and skill, requiring little to no fitting.\n\nSince the parts are interchangeable, it was also possible to separate manufacture from assembly, and repair—an example of the division of labor. This meant that all three functions could be carried out by semi-skilled labor: manufacture in smaller factories up the supply chain, assembly on an assembly line in a main factory, and repair in small specialized shops or in the field. The result is that more things could be made, more cheaply, and with higher quality, and those things also could be distributed further, and lasted longer, because repairs were also easier and cheaper. In the case of each function, the system of interchangeable parts typically involved substituting specialized machinery to replace hand tools.\n\nInterchangeability of parts was finally achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and machine tools, which were developed primarily for making textile machinery. These innovations included the invention of new machine tools and jigs (in both cases, for guiding the cutting tool), fixtures for holding the work in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts.\n\nEnglish machine tool manufacturer Joseph Whitworth was appointed as a British commissioner for the New York International Exhibition. Accompanied by another British commissioner, he traveled around several states visiting various manufacturers, and as a result published a highly influential report on American manufacturing, from which he is quoted:\n\nThe American system contributed to efficiency gains through division of labor. Division of labor helped manufacturing transition from small artisan's shops to early factories. Key pieces of evidence supporting efficiency gains include increase in firm size, evidence of returns to scale, and an increase in non-specialized labor. The need for firms to train uneducated people to perform only one thing in the productivity chain allowed for the use of non-specialized labor. Women and children were employed more frequently within larger firms, especially those producing furniture and clothing..\n\nIn the late 18th century, French General Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval suggested that muskets could be manufactured faster and more economically if they were made from interchangeable parts. This system would also make field repairs easier to carry out under battle conditions. He provided patronage to Honoré Blanc, who attempted to implement the \"Système Gribeauval\", but never succeeded. Until then, under the British factory system, skilled machinists were required to produce parts from a design. But however skilled the machinist, parts were never identical, and each part had to be manufactured separately to fit its counterpart—almost always by one person who produced each completed item from start to finish.\n\nMass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by Marc Isambard Brunel in cooperation with Henry Maudslay, and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham, the Inspector General of Naval Works at Portsmouth Block Mills at Portsmouth Dockyard, for the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic War. By 1808 annual production had reached 130,000 sailing blocks. This method of working did not catch on in general manufacturing in Britain for many decades, and when it did it was imported from America, becoming known as the \"American System of Manufacturing\", even though it originated in England.\n\nThe Lowell system is also related to the American system during this time. It emphasized procuring, training, and providing housing and other living necessities for the workforce, as well as using semi-automated machines in a centralized factory building or complex.\n\nGribeauval's idea was conveyed to the US by two routes. First, Blanc's friend Thomas Jefferson championed it, sending copies of Blanc's memoirs and papers describing his work to Secretary of War Henry Knox. Second, artillery officer Louis de Tousard (who had served with Lafayette) was an enthusiast of Gribeauval's ideas. Tousard wrote two influential documents after the American Revolution; one was used as the blueprint for West Point, and the other became the officer's training manual.\n\nThe War Department, which included officers trained at West Point on Tousard's manual, established the armories at Springfield and Harper's Ferry and tasked them with solving the problem of interchangeability. The task was finally accomplished in the 1820s. Historian David A. Hounshell believes that this was done by Captain John H. Hall, an inside contractor at Harper's Ferry. In a letter dated 1822 Hall makes the claim he achieved interchangeability in 1822. But historian Diana Muir argues that it is more probable that it was Simeon North, a Connecticut arms contractor manufacturing guns for the US Army. North, not Hall, was the inventor of the crucial milling machine in 1816, and had an advantage over Hall in that he worked closely with the first industry that mass-produced complex machines from mass-produced interchangeable parts, the Connecticut clock-making industry. By 1815 the idea of interchangeability was well established in the US government system of procurement; Congressional contracts stipulated this quality in muskets, rifles and pistols ordered after that date. Interchangeability of firearms parts at the U.S. armories was found to have been in use for a number of years by the time of the 1853 British Parliamentary Commissions Committee on Small Arms inquiry.\n\nA critical factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several machine tools, such as the slide rest lathe, screw cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. One of the most important and versatile of these machine tools was David Wilkinson's lathe, for which he received a $10,000 award from the government of the United States.\n\nEli Whitney is generally credited with the idea and the practical application, but both are incorrect attributions. Based on his reputation as the inventor of the cotton gin, the US government gave him a contract in 1798 for 10,000 muskets to be produced within two years. It actually took eight years to deliver the order, as Whitney perfected and developed new techniques and machines. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott apologizing for the delays, Whitney wrote:\nWhitney did use machinery; however, there is no evidence that he produced any new type of metalworking machinery. After completing the initial contract, Whitney went on to produce another 15,000 muskets within the following two years. Whitney never actually expressed any interest in interchangeability until 1800, when Treasury Secretary Wolcott exposed him to the memoirs of Blanc, but he spent far more time and energy promoting the idea than developing it.\n\nIn order to spread knowledge of manufacturing techniques, the War Department made contractors open their shops to other manufacturers and competitors. The armories also openly shared manufacturing techniques with private industry. Additionally, the idea migrated from the armories to industry as machinists trained in the armory system were hired by other manufacturers. Skilled engineers and machinists thus influenced American clockmakers and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860. Late to adopt the interchangeable system were Singer Corporation sewing machine (1870s), reaper manufacturer McCormick Harvesting Machine Company (1870s–80s) and several large steam engine manufacturers such as Corliss (mid-1880s) as well as locomotive makers. Large scale of production of bicycles in the 1880s used the interchangeable system.\n\nThe idea would also help lead to the American \"Golden Age\" of manufacturing when Henry Ford mass-produced the automobile. Mastering true interchangeability on the assembly line, the Ford plant produced standard model cars. These efficient production strategies allowed these automobiles to be affordable for the middle class.\n\nThe idea of interchangeable parts and the separate assembly line was not new, though it was little used. The idea was first developed in East Asia during the Warring States period and later the Qin Dynasty over 2200 years ago – bronze crossbow triggers and locking mechanisms were mass-produced and made to be interchangeable. Venice during the late Middle Ages had ships that were produced using pre-manufactured parts, assembly lines, and mass production. The Venetian Arsenal apparently produced nearly one ship every day, in what was effectively the world's first factory.\n\n"}

After attending public school, he quit his studies at Olivet College. He would eventually obtained his AM degree from Olivet College in 1914, and would obtain his doctor of laws from Northwestern University in 1927.\n\nShaw broke off his studies at the Olivet College before graduating in 1899, at the age of 23, and founded, with Louis C. Walker, the Shaw-Walker Company in Muskegon Michigan, specializing in office supplies and plugs and files.\n\nFour years later, in 1903, while still in the board of directors of the firm, he founded the Shaw Company, which published the reviews \"System\", \"The Magazine of Business\", specializing in the service and offices (typing, office furniture, etc.), and \"Factory\". The firm also published books on management. Shaw sold it in 1928 to the McGraw-Hill Company.\n\nShaw took a sabbatical in 1910, when his business was flourishing, to study the economy at Harvard University in Cambridge, where he especially appreciated the courses by Frank William Taussig, which demonstrated its influence later on in his writings. He also befriended the Professor of economic history Edwin Francis Gay, first dean of Harvard Business School. In 1911, Shaw became lecturer, inaugurating the first course in Business Policy, and became a member of the board of the Harvard Business School. He wrote the article\" Some Problems in Distribution Market,\" published in August 1912 in the \"Quarterly Journal of Economics,\" which became a seminal article in marketing studies. With E. Gay, he then helped found the Harvard Bureau of Business Research, which he helped to fund. He was also a shareholder and member of the board of the Kellogg Company.\n\nShaw argued in his books and \"System\" journal, that the federal government should be involved in the collection and data processing for business. In 1917, when the United States were about to enter war, he persuaded the Council of National Defense to create the Commercial Economy Board, of which he became the secretary. This council then became the conservation division of the War Industries Board under his responsibility.\n\nHe died in Winnetka, Illinois on March 9, 1962.\n\nThe journal \"System\" was first published in December 1900 by the Shaw-Walker Company. Since the second volume in December 1901 it went with the subtitle \"The magazine of business.\" In the very first article, entitled \"The Cost of Production.\" one of the initial aims of the magazine was described as:\n\nIn our next few issues we hope to present to our readers a cost system, which, while not applied in the sense of a balance ledger system, with all of its intricate problems, will furnish facts, sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes and one which will largely aid the progressive manager to establish his own costs in a satisfactory manner as well as point out to his superintendent any weaknesses existing in the factory, thereby profiting by a speedy remedy of excessive costs, etc.\n\nIn 1903 A.W. Shaw Company was founded and the \"System\" magazine became their flagship publication and a sensation of its time. Jeffrey L. Cruikshan (1987) recalled:\nUnder Shaw's direction, \"System\" attempted to take a practical approach to business. It was a successful magazine, and it grew steadily in size and influence during Shaw's tenure as editor. (In 1927, \"System\" was purchased by McGraw-Hill. and renamed \"Business Week.\"). But \"System,\" as Shaw saw it. faced a difficult question: how to uncover the principles that must underlie the evolving practice of business. It was a question that Shaw himself had faced in 1906, when he had helped Northwestern University design an undergraduate business curriculum.\n\nA few years late at Harvard Business School Shaw and Edwin Francis Gay were faced with a similar challenge when they were designing the curriculum for the business graduate studies.\n\n\n"}

They also contended that the workers recruited by ATC were not full-fledged Case Farms workers (despite the fact that the work, pay rates, and supervision of these workers were essentially identical to Case Farms employees.)\n\n1) A principal may be liable for the acts of a purported agent based on an actual agency relationship created by the principal’s express or implied delegation of authority to the agent.\n\n2) A principal is liable only if those actions are taken in the scope of the agent’s employment.\nExpress actual authority exists “where the principal has made it clear to the agent that he wants the act under scrutiny to be done.”\n\n3) Giving an agent express authority to undertake a certain act also includes the implied authority to do all things proper, usual, and necessary to exercise that express authority.\n\nThe evidence at trial supported the contention that Case Farms expressly authorized ATC to recruit and hire people to work at Case Farms’ Ohio plant, and that such an express agency existed with the scope of recruiting and hiring migrant workers.\nThe evidence also supported the contention that the housing and transportation activities were well within the agents implied authority—based on Case Farms’ unique recruiting challenges, the great distances the migrant workers sought were required to travel, and Case Farms outsourcing of this difficult recruiting task to ATC.\n\nAmerica's Tempcorps was an agent of Case Farms, ATC’s actions were attributable to Case Farms for the purpose of assessing compliance with the AWPA, and Case Farms was liable for ATC’s actions..\n\n"}

Instead, one competitor will take the lead in raising or lowering prices. The others will then follow suit, raising or lowering their prices by the same amount, with the understanding that greater profits result.\n\nThis practice can be harmful to consumers who, if the market power of the firm is used, can be forced to pay monopoly prices for goods that should be selling for only a little more than the cost of production. Nevertheless, it is very hard to prosecute because it may occur without any collusion between the competitors. Courts have held that no violation of the antitrust laws occurs where firms independently raise or lower prices, but that a violation can be shown when \"plus factors\" occur, such as firms being motivated to collude and taking actions against their own economic interests.\n\nThe term has also been used to describe industry-wide assumption of terms other than price. For example, all competitors in an industry might make only long-term leases of products such as heavy machinery, leaving lessors with no opportunity to make a short-term lease of that product from any competitor.\n\n"}

{"id": "1603488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1603488", "title": "Elevator pitch", "text": "Elevator pitch\n\nAn elevator pitch, elevator speech, or elevator statement is a short description of an idea, product, company, or oneself that explains the concept in a way such that any listener can understand it in a short period of time. This description typically explains who the product/company is for, what it does, why it is needed, and how it will get done. For the latter, when explaining an individual, the description generally explains one’s skills and goals, and why they would be a productive and beneficial person to have on a team or within a company/project. An elevator pitch does not have to include all of these components, but it usually does at least explain what the idea, product, company, or person is and why it/they are valuable.\n\nAn elevator pitch can be used to entice an investor, executive in a company, or explain an idea to a founder’s parents. The goal is simply to convey the overall concept or topic in an exciting way. Unlike a sales pitch, there may not be a clear buyer/seller relationship.\n\nThe name—elevator pitch—reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver the summary in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to two minutes. \n\nThere are many origin stories for the elevator pitch or elevator speech. One commonly-known origin story is that of Ilene Rosenzweig and Michael Caruso, two former journalists in the 90s. According to Rosenzweig, Caruso was a senior editor at Vanity Fair and was continuously attempting to pitch story ideas to the Editor-In-Chief at the time, but could never pin her down long enough to do so simply because she was always on the move. So, in order to pitch her ideas, Caruso would join her during short free periods of time she had, such as on an elevator ride. Thus, the concept of an elevator pitch was created, as says Rosenzweig.\n\nHowever, there is another known potential origin story that dates back prior to the story of Rosenzweig and Caruso. Philip Crosby, author of “The Art of Getting Your Own Sweet Way” (1972) and “Quality Is Still Free,” (1996) suggested individuals should have a pre-prepared speech that can deliver information regarding themselves or a quality that they can provide within a short period of time, namely the amount of time of an elevator ride for if an individual finds themselves on an elevator with a prominent figure. Essentially, an elevator pitch, or elevator speech, is meant to allow an individual to pitch themselves or an idea to a person who is high up in a company, with very limited time.\n\nCrosby, who worked as a quality test technician, and then later as the Director of Quality at International Telephone and Telegraph, recounted how an elevator pitch could be used to push for change within the company. He planned a speech regarding the change he wanted to see and waited at the ITT headquarters elevator. Crosby stepped onto an elevator with the CEO of the company in order to deliver his speech. Once they reached the floor in which the CEO was getting off, Crosby was asked to deliver a full presentation on the topic at a meeting for all of the general managers.\n\nThe concept of an elevator pitch, as created by Crosby, did not receive much popularity until two statisticians, Gerry Hahn from General Electric and Tom Boardman, a professor at the University or Colorado, started to push the concept onto other statisticians. The two pushed this concept in order to help other statisticians in promoting what they have to offer. Boardman pushed the concept much further than Hahn, resulting in the elevator pitch, or elevator speech, ultimately being linked to Boardman and his professional life.\n\nAnother origin story for the elevator pitch is from Elisha Graves Otis, the inventor of a device meant for elevator safety, which dates back to the 1850s. In 1852, Otis began developing a device that would improve the safety of elevators, specifically related to the hoists used to lift heavy equipment to upper floors. The device was created out of steel wagon spring meshing and provided a backup catch and hold mechanism if the rope lifting the elevator gave way. In 1854, in the Crystal Palace Exposition in New York in front of a big audience, Otis revealed his device. He did so by lifting an elevator, like normal, but as it was positioned approximately halfway up the elevator shaft, the rope was cut. The elevator platform was held in place by Otis’ device. This can be known as the first elevator pitch ever.\n\nAn elevator pitch is meant to last the duration of an elevator ride, which can vary in length from approximately 15 seconds to two minutes. Therefore, the main focus of an elevator pitch should be making it short and direct. According to the Idaho Business Review, the first two sentences of any elevator pitch are the most important, and should hook or grab the attention of the listener(s). Information in an elevator pitch, due to the limited amount of time, should be condensed in order to express the most important ideas or concepts within the allotted time. \n\nFurthermore, the Idaho Business Review suggests individuals who use an elevator pitch deliver it using simple language, and avoiding statistics or other language that may disrupt the focus of the listener. Bloomberg Businessweek suggests that an important lesson to think about when giving an elevator pitch is to “adjust the pitch to the person who is listening, and refine it as you and your business continue to grow and change.” When delivering an elevator pitch, individuals are encouraged to remain flexible and adaptable, and to be able to deliver the pitch in a genuine and fluent fashion. By doing so, the intended audience of the pitch will likely be able to follow the information, and will not interpret it as being too scripted.\n\nAdvantages to conducting an elevator pitch, or elevator speech, include convenience and simplicity. For instance, elevator pitches can be given on short notice and without much preparation due to the pre-planning of the content being delivered within said pitch. Furthermore, elevator pitches allow the individual who is giving the pitch the ability to simplify the content and deliver it in a less complicated manner by providing the information in a cut-down fashion that gets right to the point.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27110706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27110706", "title": "Experience management", "text": "Experience management\n\nExperience management is the activity where organizations measure and improve the various experiences they provide, not only to customers, but to all their stakeholders like vendors, suppliers, employees, and shareholders. It is premised on the idea that experiences are a distinct economic offering, that create economic value and competitive advantage.\n\nOrganizations are increasingly collecting experience data as opposed to operational data, since experiences are seen as a competitive advantage. Experience management platforms provide various services to automate the process of identifying and improving experiences across an organization.\n\nBroader than customer experience, experience management now encompasses customer experience along with other areas, such as brand experience, employee experience and product experience, which are all seen as interrelated.\n\nIn 1994 Steve Haeckel and Lou Carbone collaborated on a seminal early article on experience management, titled \"Engineering Customer Experiences,\" where they defined experience as \"the 'take-away' impression formed by people's encounters with products, services and businesses — a perception produced when humans consolidate sensory information.\" They argued that the new approach must focus on total experience as the key customer value proposition.\n\nThe concept reached a wide audience in 1999, when it was popularized by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore in their book \"Experience Economy\". In the same year, Bernd Schmitt published \"Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands.\"\n\nIn the 2000s, experience management emerged as a complex field unifying the experiences of brands, employees, products and more. It was acknowledged that generating new experiences for end customers requires designing better experiences for internal players of an organization. Value is created by focusing on the experiences of everyone involved in or affected by a new offer, such as customers, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders.\n\nTo create and manage the experiences, businesses must evaluate, implement, integrate, and build experiences from a fragmented landscape. Such needs are met by experience management platforms, which help automate the process of measuring and improving experiences across an organization by coordinating content, customer data and core services, and unifying marketing, commerce and service processes.\n\nExperience management platforms compare multiple layers of data and statistics to enable organizations to identify any experience gaps. They connect operational databases with human feedback, analyzing respondents' emotions, beliefs, and sentiments for a holistic view of the experiences they provide. Their methods include artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and statistical models.\n\nWhile the term \"experience management\" is predominantly used in business, it has another meaning. It is used for a special kind of knowledge management that deals with collecting, modeling, storing, reusing, evaluating, and maintaining experience. In that sense, the term is interchangeable with \"expertise management\".\n"}

For example, in the United Kingdom, to liquidate a company voluntarily on the ground that it cannot by reason of its insolvency continue its business, requires an extraordinary resolution.\n\nHowever, in certain circumstances a company may wish to amend its constitutional documents to provide that an extraordinary resolution needs to be passed prior to the company engaging in any reserved matters, purely as a matter of internal organisational control.\n"}

Boccardi has attempted to buy control of a Las Vegas casino, most notably Riviera Holdings, former owner of the Riviera Hotel & Casino on the strip of Las Vegas, and Riviera Casino in Black Hawk Colorado.\n\nBoccardi was born in Milan, Italy in October 1967. His father was the founder of the Istituto Finanziario Ambrosiano, a financial institution with interests in construction, real estate, and insurance. Boccardi attended the Leone XIII school in Milan, and then the Ophenaimer. He continued his studies in the United States, attending Villanova Preparatory School, in Ojai, California, but was unable to finish his junior year when his family’s holding company's collapsed.\n\nAt age 19 Boccardi established himself as a commodities trader in Monte Carlo. In his early twenties he began to invest in condominium development in Italy and in the South of France.\n\nBoccardi has attempted to buy a Las Vegas casino, since 1999.At that time, he signed an agreement to buy the New Frontier Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip, for $270 million owned at the time by Phil Ruffin. The price Boccardi was willing to pay in 1999 for the aged New Frontier Hotel & Casino, was considered too high by the lenders and gaming analysts as a result Boccardi was forced to pull out during due diligence and terminate the agreement with Ruffin. Phil Ruffin sold the New Frontier to El Ad Properties in 2007 at more than $1.2 billion, the 36 Frontier acres sold for more than $33 million an acre.\n\nIn 2000, Boccardi offered $200 million for the Desert Inn Hotel & Casino, but his offer was considered too low by owners Starwood Hotel & Resorts and was then sold to Las Vegas casino owner Steve Wynn for $275 million. \n\nIn 2003, Boccardi bid $8.50 per share for control of Riviera Holdings, owners of the Riviera Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip and a casino in Black Hawk, Colorado. The Boccardi's offer caused the stock of the company to increase substantially The offer was subject to a change of ‘control put’ and bondholders’ approval of the debt holders of the public company trading on the American Stock Exchange. Management rejected the offer, causing some shareholders to file suit against Riviera’s management for not considering the offer.Fabrizio Boccardi in an interview with the Wall Street Journal claimed that if successful buying the Riveria it would be rebranded as The Seven Sins.\n\nIn April 2004, DE Shaw Laminar Portfolios announced in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pending strategic discussions with Fabrizio Boccardi of Las Vegas regarding the Riviera Casino, and bought 10% in Riviera Holdings from Donald Trump.In May 2004, in subsequent filings with the SEC, DE Shaw Laminar Portfolios announced the termination of its discussions with Boccardi regarding Riviera Holdings. Stock of Riviera Holdings trading on the American Stock Exchange subsequently split 3 for 1 and was trading at a substantial premium.\n\nIn 2005 Boccardi Capital Systems filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, against DE Shaw Laminar Portfolios for breach of contract and other allegations in connection with Riviera Holdings, asking for compensation of approximately $140 million. The suit was finally dismissed in February 2009, and despite an appeal that Boccardi Capital filed immediately thereafter, the judgment was reaffirmed in December 2009 by the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit. \n\nTwentieth Century Fox and King Midas World Entertainment found a peaceful resolution in 2014 regarding the TYRANT Mark.

{"id": "15468281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15468281", "title": "Financial repression", "text": "Financial repression\n\nFinancial repression comprises \"policies that result in savers earning returns below the rate of inflation\" in order to allow banks to \"provide cheap loans to companies and governments, reducing the burden of repayments\". It can be particularly effective at liquidating government debt denominated in domestic currency. It can also lead to a large expansions in debt \"to levels evoking comparisons with the excesses that generated Japan’s lost decade and the Asian financial crisis\" in 1997.\n\nThe term was introduced in 1973 by Stanford economists Edward S. Shaw and Ronald I. McKinnon in order to \"disparage growth-inhibiting policies in emerging markets\".\n\nFinancial repression consists of the following:\n\nThese measures allow governments to issue debt at lower interest rates. A low nominal interest rate can reduce debt servicing costs, while negative real interest rates erodes the real value of government debt. Thus, financial repression is most successful in liquidating debts when accompanied by inflation and can be considered a form of taxation, or alternatively a form of debasement.\n\nThe size of the financial repression tax was computed for 24 emerging markets from 1974 to 1987. The results showed that financial repression exceeded 2% of GDP for seven countries, and greater than 3% for five countries. For five countries (India, Mexico, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe) it represented approximately 20% of tax revenue. In the case of Mexico financial repression was 6% of GDP, or 40% of tax revenue.\n\nFinancial repression is categorized as \"macroprudential regulation\"—i.e., government efforts to \"ensure the health of an entire financial system.\n\nFinancial repression \"played an important role in reducing debt-to-GDP ratios after World War II\" by keeping real interest rates for government debt below 1% for two-thirds of the time between 1945 and 1980, the United States was able to \"inflate away\" the large debt (122% of GDP) left over from the Great Depression and World War II. In the UK, government debt declined from 216% of GDP in 1945 to 138% ten years later in 1955.\nChina's economic growth has been attributed to financial repression thanks to \"low returns on savings and the cheap loans that it makes possible\". This has allowed China to rely on savings-financed investments for economic growth. However, because low returns also dampens consumer spending, household expenditures account for \"a smaller share of GDP in China than in any other major economy\". However, as of December 2014, the People’s Bank of China \"started to undo decades of financial repression\" and the government now allows Chinese savers to collect up to a 3.3% return on one-year deposits. At China's 1.6% inflation rate, this is a \"high real-interest rate compared to other major economies”.\n\nIn a 2011 NBER working paper, Carmen Reinhart and Maria Belen Sbrancia speculate on a possible return by governments to this form of debt reduction in order to deal with high debt levels following the 2008 economic crisis.\n\n\"To get access to capital, Austria has restricted capital flows to foreign subsidiaries in central and eastern Europe. Select pension funds have also been transferred to governments in France, Portugal, Ireland and Hungary, enabling them to re-allocate toward sovereign bonds.\"\n\nCritics argue that if this view was true, investors (i.e., capital-seeking parties) would be inclined to demand capital in large quantities and would be buying capital goods from this capital. This high demand for capital goods would certainly lead to inflation and thus the central banks would be forced to raise interest rates again. As a boom pepped by low interest rates fails to appear these days in industrialized countries, this is a sign that the low interest rates seem to be necessary to ensure an equilibrium on the capital market, thus to balance capital-supply—i.e., savers—on one side and capital-demand—i.e., investors and the government—on the other. This view argues that interest rates would be even lower if it were not for the high government debt ratio (i.e., capital demand from the government).\n\nFree-market economists argue that financial repression crowds out private-sector investment, thus undermining growth. On the other hand, \"postwar politicians clearly decided this was a price worth paying to cut debt and avoid outright default or draconian spending cuts. And the longer the gridlock over fiscal reform rumbles on, the greater the chance that 'repression' comes to be seen as the least of all evils\".\n\nAlso, financial repression has been called a “stealth tax” that \"rewards debtors and punishes savers—especially retirees\" because their investments will no longer generate the expected return, which is income for retirees. \"One of the main goals of financial repression is to keep nominal interest rates lower than they would be in more competitive markets. Other things equal, this reduces the government’s interest expenses for a given stock of debt and contributes to deficit reduction. However, when financial repression produces negative real interest rates (nominal rates below the inflation rate), it reduces or liquidates existing debts and becomes the equivalent of a tax—a transfer from creditors (savers) to borrowers, including the government.\"\n"}

Frenchy Lunning defines it curtly as \"a consumerism for the sake of consuming.\"\n\nIn a hyper-consumption society, \"each social experience is mediated by market mechanisms\", as market exchanges have spread to institutions in which they played lesser (if any) role previously, such as universities.\n\nHyperconsumerism is fueled by brands, as people often form deep attachment to product brands, which affects people's identity, and which pressure people to buy and consume their goods.\n\nAnother of the characteristics of hyperconsumerism is the constant pursuit of novelty, encouraging consumers to buy new and discard the old, seen particularly in fashion, where the product lifecycle can be very short, measured sometimes in weeks only.\n\nIn hyperconsumerism, goods are often status symbols, as individuals buy them not so much to use them, as to display them to others, sending associated meanings (such as displaying wealth). However, according to other theorists, the need to consume in hyper-consumption society is driven less by competition with others than by their own hedonistic pleasure.\n\nHyperconsumerism has been also said to have religious characteristics, and have been compared to a new religion which enshrines consumerism above all, with elements of religious life being replaced by consumerist life: (going to) churches replaced by (going to) shopping malls, saints replaced by celebrities, penance replaced by shopping sprees, desire for better life after death replaced by desire for better life in the present, and so on. Mark Sayers notes that hyperconsumerism has commercialized many religious symbols, giving an example of religious symbols worn as jewelry by non-believers.\n\nHyperconsumerism has been associated with cultural homogenization, globalization, Eurocentrism, Eurocentric modernizations, and consequently, the spread of Western culture. It has been blamed for environmental problems owing to excessive use of limited resources. It is seen as a symptom of overdevelopment.\n\n"}

He started his career with the Israel Defense Forces. After serving in the military, Kotler worked at Radware where he became the Security Operation Center Team Leader. In 2009, Kotler (along with colleague, Tomer Bitton) demonstrated at DEF CON how a hacker could feasibly spread malware through software updates for applications like Skype. At the conference, Kotler and Bitton released a tool known as Ippon (\"game over\" in judo parlance) that could ask users on a public Wi-Fi network to update a specific application. If the users agreed, they would download malware instead of the updated version of the application.\n\nKotler left Radware in 2010 and joined a digital security firm, Security Art. Kotler served as the company's CTO. In May 2011, Kotler presented at the HackInTheBox conference in Amsterdam where he demonstrated how a Stuxnet-like malware could physically destroy servers in a permanent denial-of-service (PDoS) attack. Later in 2011, Kotler and Iftach Ian Amit presented at DEF CON, demonstrating how a bot master could communicate with botnets and with \"zombie machines\" using VoIP conference calls.

A member of the Democratic Party, his congressional district extends from the western suburbs of Boston to the state's South Coast. A son of former Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, he worked as a Peace Corps volunteer and as an assistant district attorney in the Cape and Islands and Middlesex County, Massachusetts offices before his election to Congress.\n\nKennedy is a grandson of U.S. Senator and former United States Attorney General Robert F. \"Bobby\" Kennedy, a grand-nephew of President John F. Kennedy and U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, and a great-grandson of Joseph Patrick Kennedy, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom. His great-grandmother Rose Kennedy was the daughter of John F. Fitzgerald, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and Mayor of Boston.\n\nBorn in Brighton, Massachusetts, Kennedy was raised in the Boston area with his twin brother, Matthew Rauch \"Matt\" Kennedy. After graduating from Stanford University he spent two years in the Dominican Republic as a member of the Peace Corps, and earned his law degree at Harvard Law School in 2009. He resigned as a prosecutor in early 2012 to run for the seat held by retiring Congressman Barney Frank. He was sworn into office in January 2013 and sits on the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\nKennedy was born October 4, 1980 in Brighton, a neighborhood of Boston, to Sheila Brewster (Rauch) and Joseph Patrick \"Joe\" Kennedy II. He was born eight minutes after his fraternal twin brother, Matthew. He and Matt are the eldest grandsons of Senator Robert Francis \"Bobby\" Kennedy and Ethel Skakel. Kennedy was raised in Brighton and in the coastal town of Marshfield, also spending summers on Cape Cod. From birth, Kennedy was engulfed in politics; in 1980, his parents were working on the presidential campaign of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, the boys' great-uncle. Kennedy's father was elected to Congress in 1986. The pressures of political life strained Joseph and Sheila's marriage, and they divorced in 1991. The twins spent the following years moving between Brighton and Cambridge.\nAfter graduating from the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, Kennedy along with his brother enrolled in Stanford University, where he majored in management science and engineering. Kennedy's reputation as a teetotaler earned him the college nickname \"Milkman\", as his teammates on the club lacrosse team would jokingly order him glasses of milk at bars. While at Stanford, Kennedy roomed with future NBA player Jason Collins.\n\nAfter graduating in 2003, Kennedy joined the Peace Corps; a fluent speaker of Spanish, he worked in the Puerto Plata province of the Dominican Republic from 2004 to 2006, helping local tour guides in the 27 Charcos reserve in the Río Damajagua Park. He reorganized the group with some outside backing, directing the guides to rebuild parts of the park and develop skills to make the operation more attractive to tourists. \"We basically created a union,\" said Kennedy, who reported that the group's efforts won higher wages for employees while improving revenue for the tour companies. According to a press release, his other activities in the Peace Corps included \"stints as an Anti-Poverty Consultant for the Office of the President of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste and a Research Analyst for the United Nations Development Program.\"\n\nIn April 2006, Kennedy returned to Massachusetts, where he and his brother co-chaired Ted Kennedy's re-election campaign. That fall, Kennedy enrolled in Harvard Law School. While in school, Kennedy worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, providing legal aid to low-income tenants with foreclosure cases in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. As he was a prosecutor, Kennedy worked as a technical editor for the \"Harvard Human Rights Journal\", on a staff with his classmate and future wife, Lauren Anne Birchfield. In 2007 he and Birchfield co-founded \"Picture This: Justice and Power\", an after-school program for youths in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. He began an internship at the Cape and Islands District Attorney's Office in 2008.\n\nAfter receiving his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in 2009, Kennedy was hired at the Cape and Islands Office as an assistant district attorney (DA). He considered running for the Cape-based U.S. House seat held by retiring Rep. Bill Delahunt in early 2010, but decided against it. In September 2011, he joined the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office, also as an assistant DA. He resigned several months later, in preparation for the announcement that he would seek political office.\n\nIn January 2012, Kennedy announced he would form an exploratory committee to run in the newly redrawn 4th congressional district of Massachusetts. Congressman Barney Frank, who had previously represented the district, had announced his retirement, leaving an open field for the seat. Kennedy explained, \"I will then begin to reach out to the people of the Fourth District in order to hear directly from them about the challenges they are facing and their ideas on how we can restore fairness to our system. I will make a final decision about entering the race in the weeks thereafter.\"\nKennedy officially entered the election in February 2012. In an announcement video, Kennedy declared, \"I believe this country was founded on a simple idea: that every person deserves to be treated fairly, by each other and by their government.\" In the same video, Kennedy vowed to fight for a \"fair job plan\", a \"better educational system\", a \"fair tax code\" and a \"fair housing policy\".\n\nWhile several Democratic candidates had prepared to enter the race, the field nearly cleared once Kennedy announced his candidacy. His family roots made him the overwhelming favorite among Massachusetts Democrats. In the September 6 primary, he faced Rachel Brown, a Lyndon LaRouche acolyte; and Herb Robinson, an engineer and musician, winning the primary with 90 percent of the vote.\n\nIn the general election campaign he faced Republican nominee Sean Bielat, a technology executive and member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Bielat had run an unsuccessful campaign against Barney Frank in the 2010 election for the 4th district seat. In a series of debates, Bielat challenged Kennedy's qualifications for Congress, saying that the Democrat's campaign was coasting on name recognition rather than experience, and that he would be a party-line vote. Kennedy tried to tie Bielat to the budget platform of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, although Bielat responded that he only supported parts of the plan. Kennedy raised over $4 million in support of his campaign, far exceeding Bielat's draw of around $900,000. Kennedy won the November 6 election with 61 percent of the vote to Bielat's 36 percent.\n\nIn the 2014 election Joseph P. Kennedy III ran unopposed in the primary election and in the general election. On November 4, 2014, Kennedy was re-elected, winning a second term with 184,158 votes or 97.91%.\n\nIn 2016, after running unopposed in the Democratic primary, Kennedy was re-elected to a third term, defeating Republican David Rosa by a margin of more than 40 percentage points. \nOn November 6, 2016, Kennedy was re-elected, winning a 3rd term with 265,823 votes or 70.10%\n\nKennedy was mentioned as a potential candidate for the 2018 Massachusetts gubernatorial election but declined, stating that he did not have plans to run for another office.\n\nKennedy was sworn into the 113th U.S. Congress on January 3, 2013, and was assigned to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Science, Space and Technology. He praised the technology committee assignment as an opportunity to secure federal funding, including National Science Foundation and Small Business Innovation Research grants, for life sciences companies in his district. As a freshman in his party, he was unable to secure a seat on the Education Committee which he had sought.\n\nDuring a February science committee hearing, he questioned Texas Instruments president Richard Templeton regarding the company's efforts to compensate cancer-stricken former employees of its Attleboro, Massachusetts, nuclear facility. A prolific fundraiser, he launched his political action committee, the 4MA PAC, in April. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, he traveled in May with four other legislators to Afghanistan, where they met with President Hamid Karzai and members of the military. That month he was named chairman of Governor Deval Patrick's STEM Advisory Council.\n\nOn July 24, 2013, Kennedy was one of seven members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) who voted against the Amash-Conyers amendment to limit Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which tried to restrict NSA surveillance programs. In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as a supporter of the party leadership. His vote has been criticized as a sign for a lack of commitment to civil liberties.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he would deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's 2018 State of the Union address. The selection of Kennedy to give the Democratic response came after criticism that the Democratic Party relied too heavily on its oldest leaders since the 2016 presidential election. In choosing Kennedy, the party is trying to bridge the gap with a new face attached to one of the most famous names in American politics. He addressed the television cameras and a live studio audience in the automotive body shop of Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School at Fall River, Massachusetts. He is the second member of his family to give the Democratic response, after his great uncle Ted Kennedy replied to the 1982 State of the Union Address. During his response to the 2018 State of the Union, he praised Black Lives Matter and spoke in Spanish with regards to children who were brought into the United States illegally when they were minors.\n\nKennedy married health policy lawyer Lauren Anne Birchfield (born September 21, 1984) in Corona del Mar, California, on December 1, 2012. The couple met in a Harvard Law School class taught by future senator Elizabeth Warren. On December 29, 2015, Birchfield gave birth to their daughter, Eleanor \"Ellie\" Kennedy. On December 20, 2017, Kennedy announced the birth of their second child, son James Matthew Kennedy. The family lives in Newton, Massachusetts.\n\nAn heir to Joe Kennedy's fortune, he holds substantial investments in trusts and is estimated to be worth between $20 million and $60 million.\n\nOn Jimmy Kimmel Live! talk show in April 4, 2018, he stated that Markwayne Mullin was his best Republican friend.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50175094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50175094", "title": "John Wickström", "text": "John Wickström\n\nJohn Wickström (until ca. 1889 Johannes Wickström; 13 December 1870—7 June 1959) was a Finnish-Swede engineer and entrepreneur.\n\nWickström was born in Kvevlax, Ostrobothnia. He emigrated to the United States at age of 19 and settled in Chicago, where he studied engineering. Wickström specialised on combustion engines and founded company for automobile production, but, eventually, his interest focused on boat engines.\n\nWickström returned to Finland in 1906 and founded a boat engine factory together with his brother Jakob. The engines became reputable and sales grew until the 1950s, when imported outboard engines started to replace the heavy middle engines.\n\nWickström was married twice.\n\nWickström was born as Johannes Wickström in Vassor village, Kvevlax, Ostrobothnia. His father Johan Wickström was a coppersmith, manufacturer and painter. The family had nine children, the oldest of which died at a young age. He attended primary school in his home village, but, from a young age, he worked in his father's workshop. He was interested at testing and creating; after seeing a picture of a bicycle on a Swedish newspaper, he built one for himself.\n\nAs many other Ostrobothnians at the time, Johannes became interested in emigrating to the United States. After completing his school and confirmation, he borrowed money from his uncle for travelling over the Atlantic and left Finland in 1889. In the United States, he changed his name to John. Typical to Finnish immigrants, he became employed in a mine, but, due to his metalworking skills, he soon got a job in a plumbing company, after which he moved to a Chicago engineering company that produced pumps for pumping water inside skyscrapers. The company tested combustion engines, which were still undeveloped. Wickström studied mechanical engineering in North Park College, Chicago and was awarded some patents related to engines. Wickström's two younger brothers Mickel and Jakob moved to Chicago as well.\n\nSoon, Wickström focused solely on combustion engines and founded Chicago Motor Cycle Coach Co. for automobile production in 1898. The first car, branded the Caloric, was produced in the same year. Caloric featured a 10–12-hp petrol engine, and it gained attention on streets of Chicago. The car was further developed and at the early 20th century an upgraded Caloric II was introduced. Reportedly, Caloric was displayed in the first Chicago Automobile Exhibit in 1901. However, less than ten Caloric cars are known to be produced.\n\nWickström kept his focus on boat engine production. He ran the Chicago Caloric Engine Company with his business partners. The company built boat engines and repaired cars in its premises located on Wabash Avenue. The boat engines were used at lakes Michigan and Superior. Wickström was involved in a third company called Economy Engine Company.\n\nWickström had difficulties finding financing for engine development; he had to focus the production on existing, although still profitable, models. By using the property he had collected during his stay in the United States, Wickström believed he would be able to continue development of fishing boat engines in Finland, which was still an untapped market.\n\nUpon returning to Finland in 1906, Wickström had to create a market for his engines. Ostrobothnian fishermen, used to propelling themselves by rowing or sailing over many generations, were wary of combustion engines. In order to convince the potential clientele about the benefits of engine power, Wickström arranged an American-style show event in which he tugged two boats loaded with people by a motor boat up along the Kyrönjoki River. Despite the excessive load, the travelling took less than one third the time compared to rowing. Consequently, Wickström's engines gained a lot of attention and the demand grew high enough that Wickström could start serial production.\n\nWickström founded a boat engine factory in Palosaari, Vaasa together with his brother Jakob who also returned from America; the third emigrated brother Mickel stayed permanently in the United States. The factory was opened in autumn 1906, and, in addition to boat engines, the company produced stationary engines for Finnish farmers to power threshers and other machinery. Production of Wickström-engines grew over time and, in 1910, the brothers opened a new facility in Vaskiluoto, close to Vaasa harbour. The company name became Bröderna Wickströms Motorfabrik Ab in Swedish and Wickström-Veljesten Moottoritehdas Oy in Finnish (\"Wickström Brothers' Engine Works Ltd.\"). At the beginning, the brothers produced Caloric engines based on drawings which they had brought with them from America. As the engines turned out to be too complex and unreliable, the company developed modern four-stroke paraffin engines, which replaced the older portfolio.\nWickström engines changed the fishermen's way of living drastically. Due to their higher speed, the fishermen could travel home every evening, instead of bunking in fishing lodges. In 1912, 150 Ostrobothnian fishing boats featured engines. Among Finnish fishermen, Wickström's products reached a reputation of ultimately reliable power units.\nAfter the modest start, demand grew especially after World War I, and the facilities were enlarged several times. In the 1930s, the annual production was about 1,000 units, and the portfolio consisted of a number of marine and stationary engine models. The company bought production licences for British Lister diesel engines. At the turn of the 1950s, the headcount reached almost 200, and the company produced thousands of engines per year. By that time, few other engine producers had started production in Vaasa, and the city became the centre of the Finnish small engine production. Wickström was the leading producer of small engines, and any other boat engine brands were an exception in the area. As demand of stationary engines decreased after World War II, the company focused exclusively on boat engines. Wickström engines were exported to Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Japan and Canada.\n\nThe Wickström Brothers' Engine Works had a good reputation as an employer, and workers typically made long careers in the factory. Wickström led the company until the end of his life, and he was an appreciated manager. He believed that the robust middle engines, which the company produced, would stay competitive on the market; he considered outboard engines to be rubbish and did not believe in their future. However, as light glass fibre boats pushed aside the heavy wooden boats, American and Swedish produced outboard engines replaced the middle engines over time. After Wickström's death in 1959, the company kept existing for a couple of decades. By then, the Wickström company had lost the spirit of innovation, although the main reason for its decline was the spread of outboard engines and subsequent disappearing of its market.\n\nWickström married Ida Maria née Östman (1873–1952) in 1892. Their children were Sigrid Ingeborg (b. 1893), Werner Theodor (b. 1897), Roy John Elias (b. 1901) and Alma Ellida (b. 1902). The couple was divorced in 1919; as divorcing was rare and generally not socially accepted at the time, a possible reason could have been rumours about Wickström's illegitimate son in the United States. In the same year, Wickström married Julia Wilhelmina née Bergsten, with whom he had Ingrid Brita Maria (b. 1920) and Johannes Carl-Gustav (b. 1922).\n\nAt an early age, Wickström committed to total abstinence from alcohol, and he took part in temperance society activities. In Chicago, he was a member of the local Swedish–Finnish temperance society (Svensk-Finska Nykterhetsföreningen Topelius), and he was chairman of the Swedish–Finnish Temperance Federation (Svensk-Finska Nykterhetsförbundet). In Finland, Wickström supported prohibition.\n\nWickström was a founding member of the Finnish Odd Fellows fraternity in 1925. He was member of the Vaasa city council.\n\nWickström financed his birth municipality Kvevlax, his former school in Vassor village and craft school Kvevlax Slöjdskola. Many craft school students were inspired by Wickström's example, becoming entrepreneurs themselves.\n\nThe Vaasa City Theatre presented a play about Wickström's life. The performance, written by Antti Tuuri and directed by Erik Kiviniemi, had its premiere in autumn 2015. Jorma Tommila starred in the main role.\n\nWickström's patents registered in the United States are listed below:\n"}

Dr. Boulos and is one of 6 children (Frantz Boulos, Kathleen \nBoulos Weckering, Senator Rudolph Boulos, Marie Boulos, Dr. Carlo Boulos). Along with his brother Dr. Carlo Boulos, they attended and earned a medical degree in 1981 from the Port-au-Prince School of Medicine in Haiti. Reginald then furthered his education by graduating in 1982 with a Master of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the Tulane University School of Public Health in New Orleans. He conducted research with an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University. He also holds certification from the MIT Sloan School of Management for senior executives.\n\nIn 1996, Dr. Boulos left the medical practice to start a new career in business development. While representing his family's Boulos Investment Group, he became the Chairman of Intercontinental Bank S.A. (1996–1998) and negotiated a merger with Sogebank, one of Haiti's largest banks. In 2003, Dr. Boulos orchestrated the re-engineering of one of the oldest daily newspapers in Haiti, Le Nouveau Matin. From 2000 to 2010, Dr. Boulos created and developed Delimart, a chain of supermarkets, Autoplaza, a leading car dealership and Megamart, a membership food discount store. Recently, he organized renovation of a landmark Hotel in Haiti, El Rancho, re-opening as an NH.\n\nDr. Boulos is a longstanding champion of social improvement in Haiti. In 1992, he founded the Fond de Parrainage National (FPN), which today finances the education of close to 20,000 elementary school children in Haiti. He is still its Chairman. From 1982 to 1996, he was Chair and General Manager of the Centers for Development and Health, a Haitian non-governmental organization that provides services and integrated health care to the populations of disadvantaged areas of the country since 1974. Under his leadership, the Center developed and managed the most comprehensive health program in Haiti, providing health and social services to 550,000 people. He is also the founder of Haiti's Child Health Institute, a research institution and the Haitian Institute for Community Health, a training institution.\n\nDr. Boulos believes the 2010 Haiti earthquake presents new opportunities for Haiti, especially for business growth and sustainable development. Dr. Boulos proposed that donors allocate at least 50% of all funds and guarantees to formal Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and micro-enterprise financing, encourage broad ownership of larger companies, and implement SME set-asides, especially in the housing and construction sectors. Behind his recommendations, Dr. Boulos' principles are those of accountability, equality, and \"independence from international aid.\" Dr. Boulos is active in the reconstruction of Haiti, and is the Business Sector Representative for the HRIC - Haiti Reconstruction Commission, or also known as the CIRH - Commission Interimaire Pour La Reconstruction D'Haiti, which is co-chaired by former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive.\"But with foreign aid flowing and a sympathetic world watching, Boulos envisions a new Haiti: one focused on quickly creating jobs while purging its ruling class of the cronyism that helped make this one of the world's poorest countries.\"\n"}

The manager in revenue center is accountable for revenue only.\n\nA revenue center is one of the five divisions of a responsibility center – cost center, revenue center, profit center, contribution center and investment center. Cost centers, like revenue centers, only monitor costs, thereby making them a counterpart to the revenue center. Revenue centers only measure the output (in fiscal standings) and are therefore marketing establishments which are exempt from profit generation and accountability thereof. In a revenue center performance is measured by comparing actual sales to projected ones (as well as number of sales or revenue per time scale). Quota and budget comparisons are also used as a performance indicator.\n\nA revenue center has costs, however to the manager of a revenue center this is of little importance as revenue is his sole performance indicator. Not all costs are ignored in a revenue center. For example, the manager of a revenue center is responsible for the expenses of his department (such as maintenance costs). In a sales office (the most widespread example of a revenue center), maintenance costs can be construed as rent, salaries, taxes and security. However, any costs related to product sale and manufacturing are not included in such expenses. A revenue center becomes a profit center if the latter is encompassed, thus making a profit center a blend of both a cost and revenue center.\n\nIn a revenue center the manager usually has control over issues regarding marketing and sales. This is delegated to him because both of the spheres require extensive knowledge that is explicit to the local market. However, the revenue center manager will not be given control over decision on quantity or product mix. If the manager is given control over these decisions problems can arise (see below).\n\nTechnological advancements have been able to reduce expenses in revenue centers as well as bring non-traditional (online) revenue centers to non-retail companies that work in manufacturing or service industries. This can be done by setting up websites which offer products directly from the supplier. This reduces cost by shortening the distribution channel and cuts out wholesalers and retailers.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in a revenue center is that costs are mostly ignored. If costs are not monitored by another division of the business, profits can be hindered. Furthermore, the manager of a revenue center does not have the insight required for marketing decisions, consequently responsibility for a marketing decision cannot be given to a revenue center manager. Setting prices on products or services is an example of revenue center managers being unable to undertake marketing decisions.\n\nIt is easy to calculate the performance of a revenue center as revenue is the only variable being performed against. However, this means that performance evaluations are also limited to one variable which is usually not enough to see the performance of a business division.\n\nPure revenue centers hardly exist. This is due to the fact that costs cannot be completely ignored. Usually (as stated above) revenue center managers control expenses.\n\nRevenue center managers should not be allowed to make marketing decisions. For example, if a revenue center manager is allowed to set the revenue target, he will maximise revenue. This will cause the marginal revenue to become zero.\n\nIn large companies with multiple products revenue centers will be responsible for meeting revenue target for each product. The problem will arise if all revenues are added together into a total of all products. The revenue manager will then be able to make up any losses in revenue by taking the revenue from the ones that outperformed the targets to the ones that underperformed, thereby causing a loss in overall profits.\n\nBusinesses may decide to open revenue centers when entering new markets or industries. The initial cost of these centers is high and it is highly likely that a lot of time is required in order for those centers to become profitable and cover the start-up expenditures.\n\nThe following is a list of some examples of revenue centers.\n\n\n"}

He was a strong advocate of limited liability trading and promoted the advantages of the Limited Liability Company system.\n\nSeow Poh Leng, the second son of Seow Chye Watt, came from humble beginnings. He spent two years in a Chinese school and completed his schooling at the Anglo-Chinese School. After passing his Senior Cambridge examinations, he decided to become a teacher. He competed for the Queen's Scholarships in 1902. He failed to win the much-coveted prize, and attributed his failure to the fact that he had to divide his time between his duties as a pupil teacher and preparing for the examinations.\n\nIn order to help support his family, he was forced to take up additional work. After school each day he would sell nonya cakes and nasi lemak cooked by his mother and sisters. One day, when he saw some of his pupils in the distance, he threw all of his food away fearing they would see him and lose respect for him. He was punished when he returned home.\n\nLater, Seow moved on from teaching to become the manager of the Ho Hong Bank. He was also a cashier at John Little & Co for many years, before he entered the rice business. His chequered career included stints as a chemist's assistant, schoolmaster, lawyer's clerk, stock-broker, insurance agent and company liquidator.\n\nHe was one of the promoters of the Eastern United Assurance Corporation Ltd. (EUA), Chinese Commercial Bank (CCB) and Ho Hong Bank (HHB). He founded HHB in January 1917 together with Lim Peng Siang, Dr Lim Boon Keng and others, and served as its secretary and general manager. HHB was the first Straits Chinese institution to enter the field of worldwide banking and established connections with London, New York City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Batavia and many others, in order to facilitate direct trade between the Chinese in Malaya and people in other parts of the world. Later, HHB was amalgamated with CCB and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (OCBC).\n\nAccording to government archives, Seow was responsible for the development of a row of nine terrace houses along Cairnhill Road. The same records show that he owned bungalows in Emerald Hill Road and Lorong 20 Geylang Road, and had additions and alterations done to them. He bought 117 Emerald Hill in 1902.\n\nSeow Poh Leng was concerned with public welfare and engaged in many different roles and activities in this area. He suggested constructing a short connection road between Emerald Hill Road and Cairnhill Circle. He was also involved with the Singapore and South Malaya Boy Scouts Association since its inauguration, holding the position of secretary and treasurer, and did much to interest parents in the movement. Other activities included organising charity and social concerts and entertainment. His contributions to the \"Straits Chinese Magazine\" dealt with such subjects as education and social reform.\n\nA love of theatre ran in the family. According to Sir Song Ong Siang, Seow took part in amateur theatricals in the 1930s. He was a lover of Shakespeare and named his seaside bungalow in Siglap \"Titania\" and his house on Emerald Hill Road, \"Oberon.\" He was considered modern and loved artistic activities such as acting and singing, and served as the Hon. Secretary to the Straits Chinese Recreation Club in 1905.\n\nSeow was a keen sportsman on the football field and in club sports, a tennis player and a chess player. He was one of the early members of Tanjong Katong Swimming Party, now the Chinese Swimming Club, where he once held the office of vice-president. During the early years of the volunteer movement, he served in its ranks.\n\nIn 1936 His Excellency The Governor appointed him to be a member of the Council of Raffles College.\n\nIn 1937 he was elected to membership of the Council of the King Edward VII College of Medicine.\n\nApart from The Hawker Bill, in which he played a major role, he was also associated with other subjects he believed to be of importance to the common man like championing pedal rickshaws and the abolition of water meter rents.\n\nHawkers had been considered by some people to be a nuisance. In 1903, a bill was drafted by the Chinese Protectorate to provide licensing of hawkers and setting aside spaces where hawking was allowed. In 1905, Municipal Commissioners asked that the Municipal Ordinance be amended to provide them with the necessary powers to register hawkers and bring them under control, but this was refused by the Governor. There were numerous other activities through the years intended to regulate and control the number and activities of hawkers. The view among some people was that the evils of hawking were becoming more serious year on year.\n\nIn 1931, the Governor of Singapore appointed a committee \"to investigate the hawker question in Singapore and to make recommendations as to any change in policy in this respect which may be considered advisable\", consulting and taking evidence from the Municipal Health Officer, the police, Superintendent of Town Cleansing, Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Clerical Union, Teo Chew guilds, Indo-Ceylon Club and the Straits Chinese-British Association.\n\nSeow championed the plight of hawkers who he felt were being treated callously and without any regard for the social benefits they were bringing, or for their own precarious economic situation. Through articles in the newspaper, including a self-composed poem, depositions and meetings with the committee. He sought to achieve a fair and balanced outcome that would take into consideration the needs of the masses who were not European, and who relied on the lower-priced food and non-food merchandise provided by the street hawkers of Singapore, exposing in the process the constant brutality hawkers faced from the authorities and bribery hawkers often had to resort to in order to continue to operate.\n\nSeow's family lived in a shop house along Emerald Hill Road opposite Dr Lim Boon Keng, whom he had worked for on a part-time basis. When Lim heard that Lilian LuckNeo Tan's family were looking for a groom for her, he recommended Seow to them. Lilian's family wanted a kind and good man for her and it did not matter to them if he was from a poor or rich family. Lilian was the great grand daughter of famous philanthropist Tan Tock Seng. Her father was Tan Soon Toh and her mother was Lin Neo (Jambol) Seow. Tan Soon Toh's father was Tan Kim Ching, Siamese Consul General in Singapore and the person who introduced the schoolteacher, Anna Hariette Leonowens, to the King of Siam. Tan Kim Ching was the son of Tan Tock Seng.\n\nLilian Tan was a refined lady, spared from having to do household chores. Her family lived in a three-storey house along River Valley Road. When the time came for her to be bethrothed, her parents decided the groom should marry into their family which was a common practice at the time. This meant that her husband would come and set up home in her family's house. Their marriage produced three children - (Seow Sieu Jin, Amy Seow Guat-Cheng and Betty Seow Guat-Beng - later Mrs Betty Lim Koon Teck).\n\nOne evening, Lilian was out riding in the family's horse carriage and happened to pass by Bidadari, the Christian cemetery. She noted how peaceful it looked and mentioned that she would like to be buried there when her time came. When the first influenza epidemic hit Singapore, Lillian succumbed to the virus. She died in October 1918 at the age of 32. In accordance with her wish for a Christian burial, Seow asked a pastor to baptise her and she was buried at Bidadari. Lilian's mother later converted to Christianity.\n\nSeow remarried a few years after Lilian's death. His new wife, Polly Tan Poh Li (daughter of Tan Boo Liat) was his niece. Lilian's mother thought it would not be a bad thing for Seow to marry her. His children by Polly were Eugene Seow Eu Jin and Rosie Seow Guat Kheng.\n\nAn alumnus of the Anglo Chinese School, Seow instituted a medal in 1936 to be awarded to the top ACS boy at the Senior Cambridge/GCE \"O\" Level Examinations.\n\n"}

The scandal precipitated a collapse of the bank's share price which in turn led to its nationalisation on 21 January 2009.\n\nIn an RTÉ Radio 1 interview on \"The Marian Finucane Show\" in October 2008, FitzPatrick denied critics' charges that the bank had been reckless in making too many big loans to property developers as Ireland's property bubble grew. While saying he was grateful for the state's help, he refused to offer taxpayers an apology, saying\nFitzPatrick addressed the government in another speech on the same day and recommended cutting spending on what he called the \"sacred cows\" of Irish society: children, the elderly and health care. FitzPatrick was declared bankrupt on 12 July 2010.\n\nHe was born in County Wicklow, Ireland. His father was a small farmer and his mother was a civil servant who left the workforce to raise her children. FitzPatrick's only sibling, his older sister, Joyce, would go on to become the sixth President of National College of Ireland. FitzPatrick was educated locally at Presentation College, Bray. Following this he attended University College Dublin.\n\nFitzPatrick was chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank from 1986 until 2005, when he became its chairman. He resigned from that position in December 2008 when details of secret loans he had taken out with the bank were revealed.\n\nFitzPatrick was appointed to a number of positions by Fianna Fáil politicians. In 1998 the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government Noel Dempsey appointed FitzPatrick to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority where he served until 2007. FitzPatrick was also appointed as a non-executive to the Irish airline Aer Lingus in March 2004 by the prominent Fianna Fáil politician and then Minister for Transport Séamus Brennan\n\nWhen news of his secret loans became public and FitzPatrick resigned as chairman, the resulting furore also swept from office Ireland's chief banking regulator, Patrick Neary. FitzPatrick, while Anglo Irish chairman, had borrowed more than €100 million from the bank and hid the loans from auditors for eight years. The former multi-millionaire banker defaulted on the loans following a series of major business setbacks, valuable shareholding in Anglo Irish Bank once worth €80 million is now worthless followed by a failed oil venture in Africa and a stake in a casino in Asia stalled. His property investments in Ireland and Hungary were also hit by the international slump.\n\nBoth FitzPatrick and the bank said in statements on his resignation that his handling of the loans was neither illegal nor a breach of Irish banking regulations. But an apologetic new chairman O'Connor told shareholders that FitzPatrick's loans were \"wrong and unacceptable\".\n\nThe following day, headlines in the Irish papers illuminated the popular mood: \"Seán FitzPatrick Should Go To Jail\" competed with \"If FitzPatrick Lived in New York, He'd Have Been Arrested By Now\".\n\nWhen he resigned from Anglo Irish Bank, Fitzpatrick also resigned his non-executive directorships at Greencore, Aer Lingus, Experian, Smurfit Kappa, and Gartmore Irish Growth Fund.\n\nOn 16 March 2010 Gardaí were given a warrant to search Seán Fitzpatrick's house. FitzPatrick was arrested at around 06:30 on 18 March 2010 at his house in Greystones, County Wicklow. He was arrested by the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. He was questioned under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984. Under this he was able to be held for up to six hours without charge, but this was later extended. The Gardaí were also assisting another investigation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement for breach of company law. The Gardaí confirmed in a statement that \"There is an extensive Garda investigation under way, eager to see justice take its course\" In most western countries it is illegal to run a business and seek investment while insolvent. It was not confirmed by the Gardaí at first if FitzPatrick was the person in their custody, but by an independent source and RTÉ. Following the arrest, without naming FitzPatrick, the Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan commented on the situation. After more than 24 hours of questioning, he was released without charge on 19 March 2010. A file was prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nOn Friday 9 December 2011, Fitzpatrick was arrested a second time by Gardaí, allegedly as part of an investigation into \"Financial Irregularities at a Financial Institution\".\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Fitzpatrick was arrested a third time by Gardaí, allegedly as part of an investigation into \"Financial Irregularities at a Financial Institution\" He was charged with 16 offences by Gardaí attached to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement relating to his role in advising on and lending millions to a golden circle of investors to falsely inflate Anglo's share price.\n\nAfter the ODCE's investigation methods were found to be flawed, on 23 May 2017 the judge in Fitzpatrick's trial directed that he be acquitted of all charges.\n\nIn 2010 it was revealed that Sean Fitzpatrick, David Drumm, and former Anglo Irish Bank finance director Willie McAteer and Peter Fitzpatrick former director of finance at Irish Life and Permanent had 'prima facie' cases to answer in relation to their roles in controversial dealings at Anglo Irish Bank and transactions to Irish Life and Permanent, according to reports prepared by John Purcell, a special investigator.

He has been described as \"fighting to change how the West sees Arab youth — and how Arab youth see themselves — one superhero at a time.\"\n\nBakhit is the son of Marouf al-Bakhit, who served twice as prime minister of Jordan. Bakhit has said that when he was a child, \"I once had an art teacher who refunded my parents' money and advised me never to try again.\" Suleiman studied at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. His original intention was to study mechanical engineering, but after \"a couple years,\" he reportedly \"found it utterly intolerable.\" Instead, he chose to pursue a master's degree in human resources development. His graduation thesis on this subject was \"adopted by the Jordanian government.\"\n\nHe was at the University of Minnesota when 9/11 occurred. As president of the university's international student union, he began an \"awareness campaign\" to combat anti-Arab prejudice. The campaign received considerable media attention and shortly afterwards, Bakhit has said, \"four college kids attacked me on my way home late one night. They started with racial slurs, then attacked me with beer bottles. I suffered many scars and injuries that led to surgeries.\" He decided, \"Well, either I pack my bags and go home to Jordan, or I do something. And I decided the best way to fight racism is to start with the young. So I began talking to schoolchildren ages 6 and 7 about Middle Eastern culture and what happened to me on 9/11, spreading a very simple message: Not all Middle Easterners are terrorists, and Al Qaeda is like the KKK.\" Eventually he \"started realizing that mythology and stories have such great power to bridge cultural divides\" and also \"realized the power of empowering youth and women through positive role models in a medium they can relate to: comics.\"\n\nIn addition, he \"realized that actually, no, there aren’t any Arab equivalents to Western superheroes. Yes, there’s Aladdin and Sinbad, but no one has ever done an animation or comic book based on the actual mythology from within the culture.\" This recognition led Bakhit to do \"a couple of years of hardcore research, reading ancient texts, doing six month's archeological research in the Arab desert. I even learned Hebrew. I wanted to read Aramaic so I could read the Dead Sea Scrolls for inspiration. Meanwhile, I started to teach myself to draw, and came up with some characters based on my knowledge of Arab culture. It was a journey towards discovering my own culture more than anything else.\" Over time, he has said, he became convinced that his calling was to create \"characters and stories based in Arab tradition to spread the culture of tolerance.\"\n\nConsequently, he dropped out of the master's program in human resource development, returned to Jordan, and, in 2006, registered his company, Aranim. The name \"comes from a combination of 'Arab' and 'anime.'\"\n\nAfter returning to Jordan, Bakhit was physically attacked there, too, \"this time,\" he has said, \"for being such…a voice for moderation.\" According to his account, once he had \"started publishing my comic books, especially the ones that fight extremism and terrorism, I got attacked outside of my office by a couple of extremists. One of them hit me with a razor blade in my face. He was trying to take out one of my eyes. Because it was late at night and I drive a motorbike, I had to cauterize my own wound with a pocketknife before getting to a hospital. That's how I ended up with a big, massive scar on my face.\"\n\nAranim Media Factory, based in Amman, has become one of the largest producers of comics in the Arab language, it produces comic books, TV and film cartoons, digital comic strips, manga, creative media, and social-media games. His goal is “to entertain but more importantly to inspire Arab boys and girls to believe that real opportunities to be leaders are well within their grasp.” He describes himself as \"dealing in hope and tolerance\" and says that he wants \"to build the Arab Disney.\" He has said: \"I go to a lot of poor areas and ask the kids, 'Who are your role models?' Sometimes they say Zarqawi and Bin Laden. But in one neighborhood I gave them comics and when I went back a few months later; the superheroes were now their role models. It doesn't even have to be real people they look up to. There's a huge lack of positive role models in the region. Superheroes are an aspiration for what we want to be.\"\n\nBakhit develops \"the concepts, characters and stories\" for his comic books, and has a team of writers and artists who translate his ideas into the final product. He also runs \"focus groups to gauge what kids respond to.\" He and his programmers, Jordanian natives, \"learned from scratch how to program games. We bought books on Amazon and literally taught ourselves how to program, using blogs and online communities for support.\" He has said that his firm is \"the only Arab company in the entire Arab world that creates social games in-house at the quality that we do.\"\n\nAs an example of the fact that his stories \"have deep Middle Eastern mythologies ingrained in them,\" Bakhit has explained that \"in ancient Arabic mythology, fire has seven types, each color corresponding to a different one. So I gave Naar — which means 'fire' — the first hero of my first comic, the power of the seven flames. The story is about a group of kids who wake up in a future post-apocalyptic Middle East to discover they have superpowers.\" He has created another comic \"based on Jordan's real-life all-female counterterrorism team,\" an example of his belief \"in empowering young women,\" and has created a character named Element Zero, \"a special agent, kind of the Arabic Jason Bourne or Jack Bauer, who fights terrorism locally.\"\n\nIn January 2010, Bakhit founded Aranim Games. As of July 2011, his firms had sold 1.2 million copies of print comics. In 2011, Aranim Games launched \"a FarmVille-style social game called Happy Oasis\" which allows players to build a \"garden in traditional Islamic style.\" In 2012, he invented an iPhone game that he described as \"combining the Arab Spring and Animal Farm.\" He has also produced \"a web TV show based on Element Zero character.\"\n\nDuring the Libyan Civil War, Bakhit and another TED Fellow, Adrian Hong, created \"sort of a channel between Libya and Jordan to try to help some of the injured civilians come to Jordanian hospitals.\" As a result, \"over 15,000 injured civilians got treated in Jordanian hospitals.\"\n\nBakhit was named a 2011 TED Global Fellow. He spoke at the TED Global conference in Edinburgh in 2011.\n\nBakhit is scheduled to speak at the Oslo Freedom Forum in May 2014.\n"}

In 1982 general election, he cinched a landslide victory for the parliamentary seat in the opposition stronghold of Damansara, Selangor. 1984 saw him appointed as vice-president of the MCA.\n\nIn March 1984, Tan was sacked as vice-president from the MCA along with Lee Kim Sai as well as other members for urging the party to investigate its member records for the presence of non-existent people, an issue that had sparked off factionalism and crisis within the party. However, he and the other 13 were all reinstated two months later with the support of 1,600 MCA members in an extraordinary general meeting. In November 1985, he was voted to be president of the MCA winning 76.9% of the votes cast, the largest majority in the party's history, and the first challenger since 1954 to win national leadership.\n\nIn a memoir published by Robert Kuok, it was revealed that the MCA leadership approached Kuok to provide a bail payment for Tan in 1986. The amount paid by Kuok was S$20 million.\n\nTan remained a highly prominent member of the corporate sector, controlling numerous companies, including Sigma International, which had a 22.6% stake in Pan-Electric Industries (Pan-El), a Singaporean-based company. Pan-Electric entering receivership forced the closure of the Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges between December 2nd and 4th 1985, to try to contain the fallout on leveraged stockbroking firms. On 12 December 1985, Tan signed an agreement that gave the troubled company S$ 20 million of funds through an interest-free loan and allowed it to resume trading.\n\nIn 1986 he was charged in Singapore with abetting criminal breach of trust relating to the collapse of Pan-El. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment by Singapore High Court Justice Lai Kew Chai. In Lai's judgement, Lai said Tan's offences had \"struck at the very heart, integrity, reputation and confidence of Singapore as a commercial city and financial centre\". After his sentencing, Tan resigned in 1987 as MCA President and Member of Parliament for Gopeng, Perak that he won in 1986 general election earlier.\n\nIn 1988 Tan was also sentenced and imprisoned in Malaysia, declared a bankrupt, and reportedly owed over RM 400 million, at the time roughly equivalent to more than 100 million US dollars. He was ordered to pay RM1000 a month to the Official Assignee and the New Straits Times estimated it would take him 35,316 years to pay off his outstanding claims. In the mid-1990s, after full repayment, Tan was discharged from bankruptcy.\n\nIn 2012, a book by the former chief prosecutor Glenn Knight revealed that Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated in a 1996 hearing that Tan Koon Swan had been wrongfully charged in the Pan-El case. However, the book has been heavily criticised as containing factual errors.\n\nThe World Chinese Economic Forum awarded Tan a lifetime achievement award in November 2012.\n\n\n"}
