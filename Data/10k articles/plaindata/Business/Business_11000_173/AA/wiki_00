{"id": "29372362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29372362", "title": "Business relations", "text": "Business relations\n\nBusiness relations are connections between stakeholders in the process of businesses, such as employer–employee relationships, managers as well as outsourced business partners. The association of businesses began relationships which have been constructed through communication channels such as the likes of telephones, personal contacts, and e-mails. These types of contacts are maintained and deepened through similar channels in internal businesses and organizations.\n\nWithin the business of this era, the aim of many businesses whether small or internationally established is to develop a target to motivate all types of employees to form a professional relationship with one-another which will have many benefits to the business which will strongly lead to success. Furthermore, external business relationships are essential to any organization as it will improve the companies image, develop brand loyalty, and improve sales.\n\nThere are many different forms through which business relations are maintained. Primarily, these relations as stated previously, constructed through communication channels however face-to-face interactions and the social media are seen to be the most effective allowing people to form stronger ties. There have been many research studies suggesting that multiple modes of communication are important to build strong business relationships. Face-to-face interactions are typically the most effective due to the in-person communication aspect, as it allows people to form stronger ties. The more communication and interaction there is between two entities, the stronger the business relationship builds.\n\nMore specifically, internal business relations are important to maintain, as loyal employees can benefit the business by increasing profits. Moreover, loyal employees allow better relationships to be established with key suppliers and distributors and the business will be able to retain its customer satisfaction which will influence the service quality. Commitments of employees is therefore highly recommended for further positive influence on the business.\n\nBusiness relations are important both externally and internally. Research has shown that \"trust\" is one of the most critical factors to develop and enhance effective long-term relations. Whether its with other business networks, individuals in a partnered firm or employees within the organization; who with a strong positive relationship can increase one or more of the following; long-term stock market, employment rate, productivity, overall performance and other measures as stated, with companies that are more aware and engaged with CSR matters, leading to a better performance level. Moreover, researchers of organizational behavior stress about organizational effectiveness being linked with employee's attribution. Therefore, creating an environment with employee satisfaction will hinder and solve such disagreements and arguments between one employee to another and the data will significantly preferable.\n\nMoreover, as the business environment is constantly changing, it is causing firms to address new entrepreneurial innovative ideas that could out-stand them from the competition. Trust plays an important role in this as with developed business relations it allows one to react and initiate such innovative ideas to the business more effectively. There are two different types of trust that exists between business relations that affect one another, firstly \" interpersonal\" which refers to the individuals trust in one organization on other in the partnered organization. Secondly \" inter organizational \" which refers to members from the organization having a collective orientation or culture of trust towards a partner in a different organization.\n\nWith loyalty established internally in the organization and the employer aims and directs constant communication, the employer will form a strong relationship and bond between the employees and organizations; allowing them to feel more attached and sense commitment. This will result in a more motivated group of employees that will deliver high-quality services which is one of the key characteristics of \"social exchange\". Delivering high quality services is essential as it allows organizations to gain customer satisfaction which gives a positive impact on the firm as customer satisfaction boosts customer loyalty and future behaviors. Customers become less concerned and sensitive towards prices as by being satisfied they tend to pay and tolerate such an increase in prices which in the long-term establishes a positive reputation as well as increasing the economic performance of the firm. Therefore, loyalty is essential in order to gain a strong employee relationship which can link to having a better customer loyalty, with time resulting in a more organized business that has a good flow of communication both internally and externally.\n\nCommunication contact plays an important role in re-shaping the internal and external management in the organization. Communication cooperation internally can encourage \" processes, strategies, activities, policies and programs\" to be developed which enforce information and communication systems. This will have an effect on external relations which is considered to be rather important. Furthermore, establishing good communications at the beginning of the business between the employees, will provide the business with a positive reputation in the industry towards its rivalries and competitors in the market. Therefore, this could be constructed though the use of effective training programs and measurement systems.\n\nFocusing on the internal aspect of communications, will allow external networks to trust the business by having the right perspective on the processes which may occur. This is due to the fact that communication is vital to sustain, especially when partnering with another company; whether its through merging or just joining a particular project. Therefore, the ability of associating with the right businesses is relevant in order to keep the company more innovative; as networks allow for \" an effective transfer of information\". In addition, by gaining connections through networks; it can provide employee's, managers or owners to develop personal networks that can benefit oneself in the long term whether its towards a new entrepreneurial business plan, a project or even an incident that may occur within the business. An example is an entrepreneurial designer who used his personal connections in the industry to seek a potential supplier in China to continue developing his new business plan. This emphasizes on why obtaining and sustaining relations is beneficial for a business. Moreover, communication links with relationship marketing perfectly as both focus towards activities directed as establishing, developing and maintaining successful exchanges with customers and other constituents. (Morgan and Hunt 1994).\n\nOn the other hand, even though communication is a key concept to any business. Organizations should not fully depend on establishing only a few relations and shutting down others that may be beneficial, due to the fact that networking and developing relationships should not have limits. Engaging with new businesses frequently can provide positive change within the business by introducing new concepts and innovative ideas that keep up with the changes that take place in the industry regularly. Thus, businesses should accept some new organizations as well as keep close to old ones in order to sustain its position in the industry and adapt to the changes that take place.\n\nTo further extend, there are multiple ways of communicating within a business to improve relations whether its through technology, discussions in the office or through annual reports. More specifically, organizations are recommending the use of technological devices such a videoconferencing and teleconferencing which allows individuals to not be present at the same place but still be able to interact with one another, similarly the use of laptops and such. Owners and managers consequently highlight the importance of communication in the business, especially in large organizations as there are longer layers in the hierarchy as well as more commitment.\n\n'\"The effect of Social Media on business relationships'\"\n\nNowadays, Social Media plays an important role in establishing relationships. It is reported that there is 1.5 billion social media users globally, with at least 70% of companies using some form of social media (McKinsey Global Institute). Many connections can be constructed through organizations such as “ LinkedIn” where one can form new relations that can be beneficial in the longterm and contacts are usually made between individuals from different businesses. Moreover, the millennial generation more specifically are actively involved with social media on a daily basis and with the continuous change that is occurring in the industry, social media is essential for improving business performance and helping firms achieve a competitive advantage. In addition, (Cross and Katzenbach 2012 ) found that 90% of the information used for decision making came from informal networks rather than formal reports.\n\nBusiness relations within a small organization differs from the regular as it is a mix of both formal and informal management. However, this depends on the internal management and more specifically the owners/managers own personal preferences. Even though this style of management is seen to be less flexible, it is more beneficial towards expanding in size and profitability. Many believe that with owners/managers, having both a formal and informal approach operations will occur more efficiently; resulting with a better positive outcome causing growth, an increase in profitability and a positive reputation between other competitors in the market, which is what every small business intends to achieve. In addition, small business control more than half of the market but many are seen to fail due to poor planning and inefficient external business relations.\n\nSmall businesses external relations are essential for success, an external relationship is defined as \" a commercially oriented connected between a small business and other two organizations\". The most known types are alliances and networks, a relationship based on mutual interests and benefits as well as forming relationships within different organizations together into one. An example of forming an external relationship based on networking is engaging with a foreign organization, to increase financial gain and market share within the industry.This emphasizes the importance of forming external relationships, as this can push the business into having a more effective; higher position in the market, ahead of its competitors with greater brand awareness and recognition. Small businesses have a difficult time building good business relations as business relations is connected with such marketing performances and the need of having a good starting profit, time, planning and marketing expertise, therefore establishing strong external social ties from different organizations can strengthen the overall performance.\n\n"}

Mason was a scion of the prominent Mason political family of Virginia.\n\nMason was born on 17 August 1818 at Gunston Hall in Fairfax County, Virginia. He was the fourth child and second-eldest son of George Mason VI (11 August 1786–21 August 1834) and his wife Elizabeth Thomson Mason (1789–2 September 1821). Mason was a great-grandson of George Mason (11 December 1725–7 October 1792), a Founding Father of the United States.\n\nMason was a student in the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York between 1 July 1838 and 1 July 1842.\n\nUpon his graduation from West Point, Mason was promoted in the United States Army to Brevet Second Lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. Mason then served at the School of Cavalry Practice at Carlisle Barracks in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Following his service at Carlisle Barracks, Mason served at Fort Jesup in Louisiana between 1842 and 1843. From there, Mason served in an expedition to the Arkansas River in 1843. At Fort Leavenworth, Mason was transferred to the 1st U.S. Dragoons on 6 March 1843 and served at the fort between 1843 and 1844. Mason departed from Fort Leavenworth to participate in Scouting to Pawnee Villages in 1844 and then returned to Fort Leavenworth where he was again made a Second Lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons on 13 September 1844. Mason served in Fort Jesup between 1844 and 1845 and in the Military Occupation of Texas between 1845 and 1846.\n\nMason died on 26 April 1846 at age 27 near Fort Brown, Texas, 25 miles from Brownsville. Mason died of injuries sustained in the Thornton Affair (also known as the Skirmish of La Rosita), considered the first battle of the Mexican–American War. The two squadrons under the command of Captains May and Seth Thornton had marched out to reconnoiter Mexican movements when Thornton's command ran into a larger force of 500 Mexicans near La Rosita, and became surrounded. Mason and eight enlisted men were killed, along with two enlisted wounded.\n\nIt is believed that Fort Mason in Mason, Texas was named in honour of Mason. Although the fort's history dates as far back to 1845, official records indicate that Fort Mason was not established until 6 July 1851.\n"}

{"id": "958974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=958974", "title": "Henry Bonilla", "text": "Henry Bonilla\n\nHenry Bonilla (born January 2, 1954) is a former congressman who represented Texas's 23rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. He was defeated in his bid for re-election by Ciro Davis Rodriguez, a former Democratic member of Congress, in a special election runoff held on December 12, 2006. His term expired January 3, 2007 when the 110th Congress officially began.\n\nBonilla was born in San Antonio, the son of Anita Arellano and Enrique A. Bonilla. When he was young he joined a TRIO Educational Talent Search program, which provides academic support and college awareness activities to students. He graduated from South San Antonio High School in 1972 and received his Bachelor of Journalism degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1976. Before entering politics, he was a television news executive at San Antonio's CBS affiliate, KENS-TV. His former wife, Deborah Knapp (born December 1, 1954), continues as an anchor at the station. He has since married the former Sheryl White Shelby (born 1959).\n\nIn March 1992, Bonilla won the 23rd district's Republican nomination for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives (map). The 23rd had been a Democratic district since its creation in 1967, but Bonilla charged four-term incumbent Albert G. Bustamante with neglecting his constituents' needs, being involved in the House banking scandal by writing 30 \"cheques calientes\" in the House Bank, and taking excessive and questionable junkets abroad.\n\nBonilla got an inadvertent assist from the state legislature, which left a heavily Republican area of western San Antonio in the 23rd while carving the new 28th District out of much of the 23rd's territory. Despite being outspent by $758,453 to $594,032 and being in a district that Bill Clinton carried the same year, Bonilla won by a huge 21-point margin, 59 to 38 percent, the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent that year.\n\nIn March 1999, Governor George W. Bush named Bonilla as the only Texan on his presidential exploratory committee. Bonilla often represented Bush on national news programs and as a surrogate speaker. Although the 23rd had a slight Democratic lean, Bonilla developed a very conservative voting record. Largely because of his popularity in San Antonio, he did not face a credible challenge until 2002, when Democrat Henry Cuellar, a former Texas secretary of state, came within two points of unseating him.\n\nBonilla announced that he would probably run in 2006 for the United States Senate seat held by fellow Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison if she ran for governor in 2006 against the incumbent Republican Rick Perry. However, Hutchison decided to run for another term in the Senate.\n\nWhen Bonilla took charge in 1999 of an independent political fund called American Dream PAC, he made clear that its mission was to \"give significant, direct financial assistance to first-rate minority GOP candidates\". However, between 1999 and the end of 2003, only $48,750 (or 8.9 percent) of the $547,000 the PAC has received, has gone to minority office-seekers, while more than $100,000 has been routed to Republican Party organizations or causes.\n\nBonilla defends his PAC's record of assisting minority candidates, saying, \"We did the best we could.\" In all, 27 minority office-seekers, predominantly Hispanic-American, received money, mostly small donations. But Bonilla said it was sometimes difficult to find \"good, solid minority candidates to expend the funds on\". In July 2003, the treasurer of the PAC pleaded guilty to embezzling $119,021 between 1999 and 2003 and was sentenced to 15 months in prison. The thefts were not discovered until almost four years after they began. \"It was a black mark on my judgment\", Bonilla said in a 2004 interview.\n\nBonilla was priming for a rematch against Cuellar in 2004, but in 2003, a controversial mid-decade redistricting by the Texas legislature, the results of efforts by U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, moved most of Laredo, which had been one of the cores of the 23rd since its formation, to the 28th district. In its place, Bonilla received several heavily Republican San Antonio suburbs that had previously been in the nearby 21st District, all but assuring him of a seventh term. Meanwhile, Cuellar entered and won the 2004 primary against the 28th's incumbent Democrat Ciro Rodriguez and then went on to win the general election.\n\nBonilla contributed money from his American Dream PAC to the redistricting effort.\n\nSoon after the 2004 election, Bonilla was criticized when he proposed a procedural rule change that would permit House leaders to retain their leadership positions despite having been indicted by a state grand jury.\n\nThe proposal would have allowed Tom DeLay to remain as Majority Leader despite having been indicted by the Travis County district attorney's office for possible campaign finance violations. Many constituents believed that Bonilla was blatantly repaying a political favor to DeLay for having favorably redrawn the 23rd District.\n\nOn June 29, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court, with Justice Anthony Kennedy taking the lead, ruled in \"League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry\" that Bonilla's district violated the Civil Rights Act, although the justices upheld most of the 2003 redistricting. The Court declared that the Texas legislature violated the rights of Latino voters when it cut most of Laredo out of the 23rd. Although the reconfigured 23rd was still 55 percent Latino, only 46 percent of the district's voting-age population was Latino.\n\nThe justices held that as a result, the new district didn't have enough Latinos to pass muster under the Voting Rights Act. Since the legislature hadn't created an acceptable majority-Latino district (its intended replacement, the Austin-to-McAllen 25th, was not considered compact enough), the reconfigured 23rd had to be struck down as well. Because of the size of the 23rd, the ruling effectively forced the redrawing of nearly every district from El Paso to San Antonio. Precedent dictated that a new map had to be issued before the November elections.\n\nThe court issued the new lines on August 7. It moved all of Laredo out of the 23rd and into the 28th, but nevertheless made the district much friendlier to Democrats by boosting its Latino population to 65 percent. In particular, Bonilla lost many of the strongly Republican areas he had inherited in the 2003 redistricting. At the same time, he picked up much of heavily Democratic south San Antonio.\n\nBonilla had grown up in this area, which had been part of the 23rd from 1967-93. The court ordered an all-party primary on Election Day, with a December runoff if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote. The new map included Rodriguez' home and much of his former base, and he announced that he would run against Bonilla in November. Federal Elections Commission records show Bonilla paid the Los Angeles-based law firm of Latham & Watkins $100,000 in 2006, from his campaign funds, to argue that the district boundaries were constitutional. In February, the firm filed an \"amicus\" brief before the Supreme Court in support of the redistricting plan.\n\nOn November 7, Bonilla faced six Democrats, including Ciro Rodriguez and Vietnam War veteran Rick Bolanos in the all-candidate special election required by the court decision on redistricting (see above). The ballot also included one independent. Bolanos had won the Democratic primary earlier in the year.\n\nIn the first special election, Bonilla won 48 percent of the vote to Rodriguez's 20 percent. Since no one gained a majority, there was a runoff between the two former colleagues. According to unofficial results of the Texas Secretary of State , Rodriguez won the runoff with 54% of the vote to Bonilla's 46%. Bonilla was the first Republican incumbent in Texas to be unseated by a Democrat in 10 years, since Nick Lampson's defeat of Steve Stockman in a 1996 runoff election. Lampson was also returned to Congress in 2006 after being defeated for reelection in 2004, like Rodriguez in another district. Bonilla said in interviews the night of his defeat that his loss was in part a result of the changed districting. He ran controversial commercials that claimed that Rodriguez took funds from terrorists, which media outlets called \"bold claims\". He later apologized to the press for any of those who took offense, but stood by his statement.\n\nHowever, a large number of Hispanics and Latinos, who predominantly reside in District 23, had expressed disdain for Bonilla by stating that he had fallen out of touch with the needs and concerns of minorities. His reputation even earned him the nickname \"Henry Vanilla\", as some Hispanics claimed that Bonilla no longer could relate to his culture. In a year of war, illegal immigration issues, and a proposed border fence, Latinos left the Republicans side in droves.\n\nAfter his term in Congress expired, Bonilla was nominated to be Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the Organization of American States, with the rank of Ambassador.\n\nAfter two months with no action by the Senate, Bonilla asked U.S. President George W. Bush to withdraw his nomination. Following the withdrawal of his ambassador nomination, Bonilla joined the Washington-based firm The Normandy Group.\n\nIn December 2016, Bonilla and two other Texas Republicans, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and Miller's predecessor in that office, Susan Combs, were interviewed for the position of United States Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n\n"}

The circumstances of his death in 1919 in Westbury, Long Island, resulted in a sensational grand jury proceeding.\n\nBorn in 1868, Jacques Lebaudy was the oldest son of Jules Lebaudy (1828-1892), who with his brother Gustave (1827-1889) owned the family sugar refining business, Lebaudy Frères. Jules also owned property in Paris, including the Théâtre du Vaudeville. Jacques' mother Amicie (1847-1917) founded a charity to provide low-cost housing to the working poor which is still in existence. The death of Jacques' younger brother Max (1873-1895) in a military hospital in 1895 after being called up for military service despite a serious illness caused a scandal in France. Lebaudy had inherited about $15 million on the death of his father.\n\nJacques' cousins Paul and Pierre Lebaudy were notable builders of airships, such as \"La République\".\n\nIn June 1903, Lebaudy sailed with his yacht \"Frasquita\" and two other boats to an area near Cape Juby on the Moroccan coast and proclaimed the \"Empire of the Sahara\". Backed by as many as 400 hired soldiers and sixteen Hotchkiss guns, Lebaudy established a camp and set up a throne for himself in a large tent. He had various projects for ruling and improving his new domain, but European governments disapproved of his venture, and some of his mercenaries were captured by local Moorish bandits. (They later sued Lebaudy for damages for abandoning them, after being rescued by a French warship.) By October 1903 Lebaudy was installed at the Savoy Hotel in London, and soon installed his government there, appointing American adventurer George Edward Gouraud as his \"Governor-General\". Reportedly the orchestra in the Savoy restaurant would play his national anthem whenever he entered to dine under his imperial purple canopy. After several years the embarrassed French government issued a warrant for his arrest and Lebaudy left North Africa for good.\n\nAbout 1908 Lebaudy moved to the United States with his wife Augustine and daughter Jacqueline, residing mostly in expensive New York City hotels, and his behavior became more erratic. In 1915 he was placed in an asylum at the request of his wife; he at first fled the local sheriff on horseback, before surrendering but soon escaped,only to be recaptured after a few days. Lebaudy reportedly tried several times to have his wife and daughter killed, and was finally shot and killed by his wife on January 11, 1919 at her home in Westbury on Long Island. A grand jury refused to indict. He left a large estate, having inherited additional portions of the family money from his brother Max and his mother. He also had the reputation, despite his mental problems, of being at times a shrewd investor in stocks and property; he reportedly made a profit of over $1,000,000 in the stock of the Erie Railroad in 1907 when it became the subject of a takeover.\n\nLebaudy was buried in the Catholic parish cemetery of St. Brigid's, Westbury, now part of the Catholic Cemetery of the Holy Rood.\n\nIn 1922 his wife remarrried a French detective in a double wedding with her daughter, who married his son.\n\nLebaudy was the subject of wide public interest, first in France and then worldwide. Caricatures of him include that by Sem above and the 1904 poster of world political figures by Eugène Ogé to the right. He was the subject of several lampoons in London publications by the young P. G. Wodehouse. \"The Romance of Terence O’Rourke, Gentleman Adventurer\" by Louis Joseph Vance, a pulp novel from 1907 probably based on magazine stories published in 1904, is a romanticized version of the \"Empire of the Sahara\", with Terence O'Rourke being an American adventurer who is recruited to help a cowardly French millionaire become the \"Emperor of the Sahara\". Another work on Lebaudy was English artist John Copley's 1909 collection of lithographs \"The Fall and Rise of His Imperial Majesty Jacques Démodé\".\nThe adventures of Lebaudy even inspired a French game-maker to produce a wire puzzle in his honor.\n\n"}

He is best known for being the founder of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, the largest tennis museum in the world. A poet, musician, publisher, civic leader and raconteur, Jimmy Van Alen achieved his greatest renown in tennis. His greatest legacies are as the inventor of the tiebreak in tennis, and as founder and primary benefactor of the International Tennis Hall of Fame and Museum at the Newport Casino, which he gave to the United States Tennis Association in 1954, saving the national landmark from a proposed car park.\n\nVan Alen was born on September 19, 1902, in Newport, Rhode Island, United States, to James Laurens Van Alen (1878–1927) and Margaret Louise Post (1876–1969). His paternal grandparents were James John Van Alen (1848–1923) and Emily Astor (1854–1881) of the Astor family. These and other details are found in his 2010 biography\n\nHe graduated in 1924 from Cambridge University where he was a member of Christ's College and won his blue for Lawn Tennis. He was a member of the Hawks' Club in Cambridge where the main lounge is named the 'Jimmy Van Alen Room'. He was an avid tennis player and was a national singles and doubles champion in court tennis.\n\nHe helped found the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1954 at the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island. One of his contributions to the game was the development of the Van Alen Streamlined Scoring System (VASSS) which, among other elements, advocated a sudden-death tie breaker to end prolonged sets and matches. Van Alen actively promoted his system and in 1970 the U.S Open became the first Grand Slam tournament to introduce, on an experimental basis, the tie-break. Initially it was a best-of-nine-points, sudden death tie-break which made it possible to have simultaneous match points for both players. Via a few intermediary steps this would evolve into the current best-of-twelve-point tie-break.\n\nHe was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 1965.\n\nHe was a great fan of Clement C. Moore's famous poem \"A Visit from Saint Nicholas\" which is more commonly known as \"Twas the Night Before Christmas\". He purchased and restored the Clement C. Moore house on Catherine Street in Newport, RI and would make an annual public reading of the poem to children during the Christmas season.\n\nHe died after striking his head in a fall at his home on July 3, 1991. He is buried with his wife at the Berkeley Memorial Cemetery at Saint Columba's Chapel in Middletown, Rhode Island.\n\nTwo days after his death, on July 5, 1991, in a Wimbledon semifinal, Stefan Edberg lost to Michael Stich 6–4, 6–7, 6–7, 6–7. Edberg did not lose serve. Later, after hearing of Van Alen's death, Edberg said: \"If he hadn't lived, Michael and I might still be out there playing\".\n\n"}

{"id": "23062020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23062020", "title": "Marketing information system", "text": "Marketing information system\n\nA marketing information system (MKIS) is a management information system (MIS) designed to support marketing decision making. Jobber (2007) defines it as a \"system in which marketing data is formally gathered, stored, analysed and distributed to managers in accordance with their informational needs on a regular basis.\" In addition, the online business dictionary defines Marketing Information System (MKIS) as \"a system that analyzes and assesses marketing information, gathered continuously from sources inside and outside an organization or a store.\" Furthermore, \"an overall Marketing Information System can be defined as a set structure of procedures and methods for the regular, planned collection, analysis and presentation of information for use in making marketing decisions.\" (Kotler, at al, 2006)\n\nReid and Bojanic(2010) claimed that, \" The term market research informs relatively narrowerly than Marketing Information System(MkIS) which is altered from the term management information systemization. Market research indicates that information is not collected for a specific reason or project; the major objective is a one-time use. \"\n\n\"A marketing information system, which continuously collects the initial, routine and systematic data, is not only used for one particular topic but is designed for monitoring the degree of the marketing success to ensure the achievable of the operation as well.\"\n\nDeveloping a MKIS system is becoming extremely important as the strength of economies rely on services and to better understand the specific needs of customers. Kotler, et al. (2006) defined it more broadly as \"people, equipment, and procedures to gather, sort, analyze, evaluate, and distribute needed, timely, and accurate information to marketing decision makers.\"\n\nInsofar as an economy focuses on services, marketing is important to \"monitor the marketing environment for changes in buyer behavior competition, technology, economic conditions, and government policies.\" In this sense, the role of marketing is becoming pivotal for an organization to \"adapt to changes in the market environment.\" (Harmon, 2003)\n\nAs an economy relies on the acquisition of knowledge, MkIS systems are necessary to be able to define and differentiate the value proposition that one organization provides with respect to another, as well as to define their competitive advantage. (Harmon, 2003)\n\nThe main benefit of MkIS systems is to integrate market-monitoring systems with strategy development and the strategic implementation of policies and processes that help capture and act on customer management applications with marketing decision support systems. This area constitute Marketing intelligence that supports the analysis and market based activities that support customer relations and customer service with real time information with real time applications that support market based approaches.\n\nShajahan and arya(2004) stated that, \"Demands for the MkIS can be expressed by three crucial developments. Firstly, when companies expand and diversify into new markets, both the companies and customer's point of view are needed to be handled by the marketing managers. Therefore, there would be greater need for marketing information. Secondly, when consumers obtain an increment in the level of their income, it causes a tendency for them to be more discriminating during the purchasing procedure. A full awareness of the points that drive a consumer prefer a brand and the points that distinguished his brand from that of the rivals should be obtained by the marketers. This awareness is possible only with the help of a well- designed effective MkIS. Thirdly, the development of the markets and the movement from price to non-price grounds of competition lead to an increase in the importance of adoption and implementation by the competitors and finding the response of the consumers towards them. Analyzing the needs for MkIS from a third person's angle, three more factors come to the forefront viz., the information explosion, increasing complexity in decision making and the technological developments. \" \n\nIn addition, \"Great demand of information gathering for marketing decisions results in the need of attention by themselves. Though marketing research information can be generated by studies, which are normally conducted in the market place whereas marketing information systems are designed to gather, integrate, process and distribute marketing information comprehensively from all sources, including that from marketing research. The contrasting characteristics of MkIS and MR are presented in Table 5.1 as shown below:\n\nTable 5.1 Showing contrasting characteristic of MR and MkIS\n\nThe business function of marketing is concerned more with the planning, promotion and sale of products in existing markets and the development of new products and new markets. Thus marketing performs a vital function in the operation of a business enterprise. Business firms who turned to computers have been able to perform vital marketing function effectively for organizations' growth in the face of global competition.\"\n\nAccording to Robert Jamon (2003), MkIS systems are decomposed on four components: (1) user interfaces, (2) application software, (3) databases, and (4) system support. The following is a description of each one of these components.\n\n1. User interfaces. The essential element of the MAkINAS is the managers who will use the system and the interface they need to effectively analyze and use marketing information. The design of the system will depend on what type of decision managers need to make.\n\n2. Application software. These are the programs that marketing decision makers use to collect, analyze, and manage data for the purpose of developing the information necessary for marketing decisions.\n\n3. Database marketing. A marketing database is a system in which marketing data files are organized and stored.\n\n4. System support. This component consists of system managers who manage and maintain the system assets including software and hardware network, monitor its activities and ensure compliance with organizational policies.\n\nAlong with these components, MkIS systems include Marketing Decision Support Systems (MDSS), which in turn rely on simple systems such as Microsoft Excel, SPSS, and on-line analytical tools that help collect data. Data compiled for analysis is stored and processed from a data warehouse, which is simply a data repository system that helps store and further process data collected internally and externally. (Harmon, 2003)\n\nFrom Pride and Ferrell (2010), \"Internal database is a part of the most marketing information systems. In addition, it's relatively convenient for access and retrieve of information. A databases allow marketers to tap into an abundance of information useful in making marketing decisions: internal sales reports, newspaper articles, company news releases, government economic reports, bibliographies, and more, often accessed through a computer system.\"\n\nIn with Birn(2004), \" internal data is a part of the data that is needed to be collect and handled by the marketing information system. Further more, managers regard this as a command to make effective operation.But getting the information that is really needed from a marketing information system depends on what the information is and how it is used. The following internal operating data are essential:\n\nSandhusen(2000) defined that, environmental scanning is a display of the nature of MIS processed. \" It gives assistance for the marketers to develop the strategies, policies, plans and to make programs and budgets through dealing with the ongoing information on trends.\"\n\nAccording to Philip Kotler, the four components that comprise the MkIS system are Internal Reports (Records) System, Marketing Research System, Marketing Intelligence System, and Marketing Decision Support System\n\n1.Internal Reports System: It records various data from different department of a company, which is regarded as a major source of information.\n\n2.Marketing Intelligence System: It is a main source used by managers for gaining daily information of the external environment, hence assists the managers to react to the changing rapidly.\n\n3.Marketing Research System: It is used to collect primary and secondary data, and displays the results in forms of reports.\n\n4.Marketing Decision Support System: Compared to the supply of the data by the three previous systems, it focuses more on processing the data.\n\nBhasin stated that,\"With an increasingly competitive and expanding market, the amount of information needed daily by an organization is profound. So they have to establish a Marketing Information system. There are several advantages of Marketing information systems\n\n\n\"Nevertheless, the collection of marketing information should obey a high-frequent manner due to the rapid change in the external market.\" The possible risks the business may face if they disobey the manner according to Bhasin are:\n\nMaintenance, complexity and setting up a MkIS are one of the major hindrances to Marketing information systems. Furthermore, wrong information being fed in MkIS can become cumbersome and appropriate filters need to be established.\n\nKotler and Philip have said that \"both primary and secondary researches offer loads of the data and information needed for the marketers, whereas the secondary data sources are relatively superior in quick provision of data at lower cost. Simultaneously, a firm cannot find all the data required by itself, but sometimes can be done with the help of secondary research. However, researchers must assess those data collected from both primary and secondary data sources to enable the accuracy, updates and fairness. Each primary data collection method – observational, survey, and experimental – has its own advantages and disadvantages. Similarly, each of the various research contact methods – mail, telephone, personal interview, and online – also has its own advantages and drawbacks.\" \n\nA RuMIS is necessary not only for corporate organizations engaged in marketing of agricultural goods and manufactured goods intended for sales in rural areas. RuMIS is required also by the agriculturists and farmers who have enormous decis!ion-making to do.\n"}

His writing focuses on \"consultative selling,\" an approach he pioneered and documented in his book SPIN Selling (McGraw-Hill).\n\nRackham has been a consultant to executives and board members at more than 40 of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies, including IBM, Xerox, AT&T, Citicorp, GE, Microsoft, and Oracle, as well as to professional services organizations such as KPMG, Booz Allen, and McKinsey & Co..\n\nHe is currently a visiting professor at Portsmouth University, Cranfield School of Management, and Sheffield University, all in his native England, as well as at the University of Cincinnati, and is a frequent lecturer at conferences, business schools, and corporations around the world.\n\nNeil Rackham was born in England and spent some of his early years in Borneo. He was later educated at Totton Grammar School, Hampshire, England and then studied psychology at Sheffield University where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1966.\n\nHe continued as a post-graduate research fellow in psychology at Sheffield through 1969, developing new tools to study and measure the role of interpersonal skills in successful negotiating and selling.\n\nRackham’s work as a research fellow led to his first books, The Evaluation of Management Training (Gower Press, 1970), written with Peter B. Warr and Michael William Bird; Developing Interactive Skills (Wellens Publishing, 1971), co-authored with Peter Honey and Michael J. Colbert; and Behaviour Analysis in Training (McGraw-Hill UK, 1977), with Terry Morgan.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1974, Rackham served as managing director of Performance Improvement Ltd., improving high-level job skills for clients such as IBM, BP, British Airways, Xerox and Honeywell.\n\nIn 1974, he founded the Huthwaite Research Group, which later became Huthwaite Inc., a global research and consulting firm based in Northern Virginia, and, Huthwaite Ltd., based in the United Kingdom.\n\nHaving developed methods for measuring interactive behavior in his research fellowship, Rackham produced a series of seminal articles that focused on practices and behavior associated with successful negotiations:\n\nDeciding to apply these same methods to the world of sales and explore effective behaviors in successful business-to-business selling, Rackham sought the support of major multinational companies including Xerox and IBM, and raised an initial $1 million for a landmark study.\n\nThe project, the first to scientifically measure selling and buying behavior and by far the largest study of its kind, involved a team of 30 researchers who studied 35,000 sales calls in over 20 countries. The research spanned 12 years.\n\nIt led to the publication of Making Major Sales (Gower Press, 1988), a book that had a tremendous impact on the world of sales in Europe, and then to two New York Times business bestsellers — SPIN Selling (McGraw-Hill, 1988) and, one year later, Major Account Sales Strategy (McGraw-Hill) — earning international acclaim for its author.\n\nThe theories behind these books, seen as controversial at first, have since been recognized as game-changers in the world of selling.\n\nAt the time, the conventional wisdom in the sales world was that \"selling was selling\" - that the techniques that were successful in smaller consumer sales worked equally well in more complex business-to-business transactions. Rackham’s multi-year research project turned this thinking on its ear and showed that, on the contrary, conventional methods developed for small consumer sales, such as widely used techniques for closing the deal, failed miserably when applied in more complex transactions. He found that greater success could be achieved in larger-scale transactions by focusing on a pattern of questions (situation, problem, implication, and need-payoff) that became widely known as SPIN.\n\nRackham’s premise in SPIN®Selling was that the most successful sellers are seen by their customers as consultants or problem solvers who are working in the customers’ best interest.\n\nIn its list of the “Top 10 ‘How To Sell’ Books of All Time,” in 2013 Inc. magazine ranked SPIN®Selling No. 1, writing:\n\n″Finally, this is the book that turned selling from an art into a science. While other sales books are heavy with anecdotes and assumptions, Neil Rackham examined hard evidence of actual sales performance and codified what works — and what doesn’t — in real world sales situations. A must-read for everyone who sells″\n\nSPIN Selling remains one of McGraw-Hill’s all-time top-selling business books. It is currently Amazon’s best-selling book on sales.\n\nAmong Rackham’s other books on sales and marketing are The Management of Major Sales (McGraw-Hill, 1991) with Richard Ruff; Getting Partnering Right (McGraw-Hill, 1996), with Lawrence Friedman and Richard Ruff, and the New York Times business bestseller Rethinking the Sales Force (McGraw-Hill, 2000), co-authored with John DeVincentis.\n\nIn addition to books, Rackham has written more than 150 articles on marketing, selling and channel strategy including “Ending the War Between Sales and Marketing,” co-authored with Philip Kotler and Suj Krishnaswamy for Harvard Business Review (2006),“Breadth of a Salesman,” with John DeVincentis, for McKinsey Quarterly (1998), and “Why Bad Things Happen to Good New Products” for the Journal of Product Innovation Management (1998).\n\nRackham led Huthwaite Inc. until 2003 and later became a strategic advisor to the firm he founded.\n\nHe has been a visiting professor of sales and marketing at Portsmouth University since 2006; a visiting professor of sales strategy at the Cranfield School of Management since 2008; an executive professor of professional selling at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business at the University of Cincinnati since 2011; and visiting professor of sales at Sheffield University since 2014.\n\nHe has also been a guest or visiting lecturer at numerous U.S. business schools including Harvard Business School, Wharton, Kellogg School of Management, Darden School of Business, Kelley School of Business, Ohio University, and Purdue University.\n\n\nRackham lives in Northern Virginia with his wife, Ava Abramowitz, a professorial lecturer in law at George Washington University Law School. In his spare time, he writes poetry and science fiction, and his first book length work of fiction, \"A Telling Of Stones\", is to be published in 2016.\n"}

The firm was headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, with additional offices in New York City, London, Boston, San Francisco, and Chicago. It partnered with several large systems integrators and infrastructure software companies, including SAP, Thomson Reuters, Kx Systems, and One Market Data (OneTick). The company's name is derived from the Greek: 'pan' for all, 'optic' for sight. The company name is derived from the word panopticon which is an architectural concept originally intended to facilitate surveillance of prisons.\n\nIn August 2013, Panopticon was acquired by Datawatch Corporation.\n\nPanopticon Software was a key player in the data visualization sector along with for example Qliktech, Tableau Software and Tibco Software. Its Swedish origins are shared with GapMinder, Qliktech and Spotfire, making Sweden a centre for Information Visualization research and development.\n\nIt historically specialised in selling Treemapping and Heatmap visualisation software and development tools to clients within the financial services and telecommunications industries. It uses a variety of other visual analysis tools in its products, including Scatter Plots, Dot Plots, Pie Charts, Line Graphs, and Bullet Graph visualizations. The company's products are sometimes deployed as Executive Dashboards that allow managers to interact, explore, monitor and analyze rapidly changing and/or large data sets. Panopticon tools are also often embedded in other enterprise applications using the company's software development kit, which is available for Java, Microsoft .NET and the Windows Presentation Foundation. The Panopticon products are optimized for use with real-time data message buses, complex event processing engines, relational databases, and column-oriented databases and is a regular exhibitor at financial industry events such as Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, and SIA.\n\nThe company was founded in 1999 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the emerging markets brokerage Brunswick Direct before being spun off as a separate entity in 2002. It later was acquired by the UK based Hamsard Group (Hamsard is now known as Cantono Plc), and became a subsidiary of the Group. In March 2007 its competitor Spotfire undertook negotiations with Hamsard Group, to take full ownership of Panopticon. This potential deal was not completed, Spotfire pulling out of negotiations, and itself subsequently being purchased by Tibco. In May 2007 the company was sold back to its founders as part of a management buyout.\n\nIn March 2012, the company announced that Omaha Foreign Exchange had deployed Panopticon visual data analysis software within its new facilities to analyze risk, liquidity and other key performance factors.\nIn May 2012, the company announced that QlikTech had partnered with Panopticon to enable QlikTech clients to embed Panopticon data visualizations into their QlikView dashboards. Panopticon supports QlikView desktop, web, and mobile interactive dashboards and allows users to filter and interact directly with real-time data.\nIn June 2012, the company announced that SAP was utilizing its Panopticon data visualization tools as the front end for real-time deployments of the SAP HANA in-memory appliance.\nIn August 2012, the company announced that Campbell & Company, an asset manager with over $3 billion under management, had implemented its advanced data visualization tools as part of a OneTick deployment. Campbell & Co. decided it needed a better way to store, distribute and visualize its data, so it turned to OneMarketData and Panopticon for the solution.\n\nIn January 2013, the company announced record results for the previous year with 112% books growth.\nIn April 2013, Panopticon was selected for inclusion in UBM Tech Channel's CRN 2013 Big Data 100 list. The Big Data 100 recognizes innovative technology vendors that help businesses manage \"Big Data\" — the rapidly increasing volume, variety and velocity of information being generated today. The list covers three categories: business analytics, data management, infrastructure and services. The Big Data 100 includes many established vendors as well as startups and specialized suppliers of niche products that help businesses address Big Data needs.\nIn April 2013, Panopticon was named a Gartner \"Cool Vendor\" in the Cool Vendors for In-Memory Computing 2013 report by Gartner, Inc. The April 23, 2013 report was co-authored by Roy Schulte, Roxane Edjlali, et al. This is the first year that Gartner has called out In-Memory Computing specifically as a subject for one of its Cool Vendor reports.\nIn June 2013, Panopticon announced that Tony Evans had joined the company in the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer. Evans will head the growing Panopticon sales and marketing group and work directly and will be part of the company's executive management team. Evans will be based in the company’s expanded New York office.\nIn August 2013, Datawatch Corporation (NASDAQ-CM: DWCH) announced that it had completed its acquisition of Panopticon Software AB.\nPre-Attentive Processing is a term from the area of human cognitive psychology and refers to the ability of the low-level human visual system to rapidly identify certain basic visual properties. Examples of visual features that can be detected in this way include hue, intensity, enclosure, orientation, size, and motion.\n\nPanopticon's technology relies on in-memory OLAP cubes, which are displayed through a series of visualizations including treemaps. This allows the user to load data, select variables and hierarchical structures, and navigate through the resultant visualization, filtering, zooming and drilling (sometimes called slicing and dicing), to identify outliers, correlations and trends.\n\nIts streaming OLAP implementation takes an in-memory OLAP cube and allows data to be streamed through it. This combination makes the company's products attractive to industry verticals that require live streaming data, such as financial market data utility grid monitoring and telecommunications network traffic analysis. This is very different than the vast majority of OLAP implementations in which cubes are rebuilt periodically for new batches of data.\n\nThis support for streaming data with its products has allowed financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase\n, Citigroup\n, Citadel\n, and BlackRock\nto implement the Panopticon Products within their real-time trading and risk applications. \nEuromoney has stated that it provides the trader community with a way of quickly digesting information.\n\nPanopticon has two platform independent product lines: Its enterprise application, which support enterprise deployments and also provides the ability to embed Panopticon tools into third party applications, and its SDKs in Java language, .NET Framework and Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation.\n\n"}

He is best known as a close associate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\n\nPlaton Lebedev graduated from the Academy of National Economy Plekhanov in Moscow in 1981. After graduating he worked in the Foreign Trade Department \"Zarubezhgeologia\" (Russian: Зарубежгеология) of the Soviet Ministry of Geology until 1989. There he met Leonid Nevzlin who subsequently introduced him to Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Between 1989 and 1992, Lebedev headed the currency and finance department of Khodorkovsky's Bank Menatep and became president and a member of the board in 1993. He served as president until 1995. Since 1996 he sat on the board of oil company Yukos. Lebedev served as CEO of Group Menatep Ltd. (principal shareholder of YUKOS) from 2002 until his arrest in July 2003.\n\nSince 1997, Platon Lebedev holds a stake of about 7 percent in Group Menatep Limited, now GML Limited. Holding company GML Limited controls 51% of Yukos shares. The other four ultimate beneficial owners of GML Limited are Leonid Nevzlin, Mikhail Brudno, Vladimir Dubov and Vasily Shakhnovsky.\n\nOn 2 July 2003, Platon Lebedev, then chairman of the board of Menatep, was summoned as a witness to the Prosecutor General’s Office in an investigation into embezzlement of state funds. Shortly before the scheduled visit, Lebedev however felt ill at about 5 a.m. and was taken to a hospital. Lebedev then subsequently was arrested in the hospital on suspicion of stealing a 20% stake in JSC Apatit.\n\nOn 31 May 2005, Lebedev was convicted of tax evasion in 2005, and sentenced to nine years in prison. He was subsequently charged with embezzlement and money laundering in 2009, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. There has been speculation that these charges were politically motivated.\n\nOn 27 December 2010, Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky were each sentenced to 13 years in prison for money laundering and embezzlement. In the second case against them, they were found guilty of organizing a criminal group in the oil business, embezzling 218 million tonnes of oil from Yukos’ oil extraction subsidiary companies, Uganskneftegaz, Tomskneft and Samaraneftegaz. \nIn December 2013 Khodorkovsky was released while Lebedev was released on 24 January 2014. \"A short prison sentence might be considered a victory for Mr. Putin’s protégé, President Dmitri A. Medvedev, a former law professor who is thought of as less of a hard-liner. Mr. Medvedev has been promoting policies to modernize Russia, and analysts say the Khodorkovsky case is an obstacle toward convincing foreign investors that the country’s legal system is fair.\"\n\nOn 24 May 2011, Lebedev and Khodorkovsky were named prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International, which criticized the men's second trial and called for their release on the expiry of their initial sentences.\n\nOn 7 August 2012, Lebedev's 13-year sentence was reduced by 3 years and 4 months by a district court judge in the Arkhangelsk region city of Velsk, where Lebedev had been imprisoned. This action came as a result of the prosecutor's office requesting a re-qualification of Lebedev's offenses due to the passage of a new legal statute in the Russian Criminal Code which reduced the punishment for offenses of which he had been convicted.\n\nOn 25 October 2013, the Berlin International Literature Festival held a worldwide reading in solidarity with Platon Lebedev and all criminals who allege they are political prisoners in Russia.\n\nOn 23 January 2014, the Russian Supreme Court reduced Lebedev's sentence and ordered his release from prison. But Supreme Court Judge Pyotr Serkov did not change a court order under which Lebedev and Khodorkovsky had to pay 17bn roubles ($500m; £300m) in tax arrears. Immediately after his release, Lebedev said in an interview with Ren TV that he intended to resume business.\n\nIn February 2015, Platon Lebedev announced his first press conference after his release from prison in Moscow on 18 February 2015.\n"}

{"id": "6240335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6240335", "title": "Ruth Bryan Owen", "text": "Ruth Bryan Owen\n\nRuth Baird Bryan Leavitt Owen Rohde, also known as Ruth Bryan Owen, (October 2, 1885 – July 26, 1954) was a politician and the first woman appointed as a United States ambassador. The daughter of attorney William Jennings Bryan and Mary E. Baird, she was a Democrat, who in 1929 was elected as Florida's (and the South's) first woman US Representative, coming from Florida's 4th district. Representative Owen was also the first woman to earn a seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nIn 1933, she became the first woman to be appointed as a U.S. ambassador, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt selected her as Ambassador to Denmark and Iceland.\n\nRuth Bryan was born on October 2, 1885 in Jacksonville, Illinois to William Jennings Bryan and his wife Mary E. Baird. Ruth's father was an attorney and three-time presidential candidate. Growing up Ruth had to move several times depending on her father's work in politics. Ruth attended public schools in Washington, D.C and the Monticello Female Academy in Godfrey, Illinois. In 1901 she began to take classes at the University of Nebraska.\n\nIn 1903 Bryan dropped out of the University of Nebraska to marry William H. Leavitt, a well-known Newport, Rhode Island portrait painter. The couple met when he was painting Bryan's father's portrait. The couple had two children before divorcing in 1909.\n\nBryan married Reginald Owen, a British Army officer, in 1910, and had two more children with him. Her second husband died in 1928. She spent three years in Oracabessa, Jamaica, where she oversaw the design and construction of her home, Golden Clouds. It is now operated as a luxury villa. Owen kept her home in Jamaica for more than three decades and spent many winters there, particularly in later years when she lived in Denmark and New York City. She detailed her time in Jamaica and experiences at Golden Clouds in her book, \"Caribbean Caravel.\"\n\nDuring World War I, Bryan served as a war nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment in the Egypt–Palestine campaign, 1915–1918. She also served as a secretary for the American Women's War Relief Fund.\n\nRuth Bryan Owen was a female pioneer in the film industry. She was a director, producer, and screenwriter for a feature film in 1922, called \"Once Upon a Time/Scheherazade,\" which is now considered to be lost. In the spring of 1921, she started production of \"Once Upon a Time.\" The film featured the Community Players of Coconut Grove, Florida, and was not related to a major studio at the time.\n\nThe story line was said to revolve around a shah who is dethroned by his jealous subordinate, who in turn uses his new power to torture young women who do not amuse him. Towards the end, the sadistic ruler runs into the most beautiful one of all, and the exiled shah returns just in time to save the young woman from his nemesis. According to the Moving Picture World, the costuming was ornate and elaborately done, the staging was complicated, and the mise-en-scène evoked an \"atmosphere of experience in the Far East\". Owen had done extensive traveling, and visited countries such as India, Burma, Sri Lanka, China and Japan. Inspired by these places, she used them as the backdrop for her film.\n\nLittle would be known about the film except that Owen discussed it in correspondence with her friend, Carrie Dunlap. Dunlap was from Illinois and served as campaign treasurer for Ruth's father William Jennings Bryan. In her letters to Dunlap, Owen expresses great joy in her film, quoting, \"I can scarcely believe the film is mine when I see it 'projected' on the wall above our fireplace.\"\n\nShe thought of herself as a true pioneer in the industry. Her correspondence with Dunlap also revealed her intent to become one of the first female filmmakers in the U.S. Owen funded the film solely from her earnings in the public speaker circuit. In her letters, Owen discussed the support she gained from the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and their contribution to help secure a distribution deal with the Society for Visual Education.\n\nOwen first ran for office in 1926 for the Democratic nomination for Florida's 4th congressional district. It was a year after the death of her father. It then included nearly the entire east coast of the state from Jacksonville to the Florida Keys: with Miami, Orlando and St. Augustine. She lost by fewer than 800 votes.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1928, she was an administrator at the University of Miami.\n\nTwo years later, after the death of her husband, she ran again. Since Owen played a significant role when hurricane hit Miami in 1927 and put effort on promotions on newspapers, she won over Sears by more than 14,000 votes and was elected to Congress in November 1928 and began her term of office on March 4, 1929, while a widow and mother of four. Her election was contested on the grounds that she had lost her citizenship by marrying an alien. By the Cable Act in 1922, she could petition for her citizenship, which she did in 1925, less than the seven years required by the Constitution. She argued her case before the House Committee on Elections, saying that no American man had ever lost his citizenship by marriage. She said that she lost her citizenship because she was a woman, not because of her marital status. The U.S. House of Representatives voted in her favor.\n\nOwen ran for re-election in 1930, defeating Daytona Beach attorney Dewitt T. Deen by a wide margin in the June Democratic primary election. As the Republican Party was running its first primary campaign in Florida history in 1930 and did not nominate a candidate to run against the Democratic nominee, the pro-prohibition Owen was heralded in the press as presumably having won re-election by virtue of her Democratic nomination.\n\nOwen's two-year term won in 1930 would prove to be her last, however, as in the 1932 Democratic primary she was defeated by Democratic candidate J. Mark Wilcox, who advocated the repeal of Prohibition. Her Congressional career thus came to an end in March 1933.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1936 Bryan Owen served as United States Ambassador to Denmark, appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She served successfully until 1936, when she married Borge Rohde, a Danish Captain of the King's Guard, on July 11. The marriage gave her dual citizenship as a Dane—in addition to that of the United States—so she resigned her ambassadorial post in September. Ruth Bryan Owen married Captain Borge Rohde at the estate of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt in Hyde Park, New York. Fannie Hurst, noted novelist and close friend of the bride, was matron of honor. Mrs. Owen announced that she would retain her own name in her diplomacy and literary careers.\n\nShe served as a delegate to the San Francisco Conference, which established the United Nations after World War II. In 1948, President Truman named her an alternate delegate to the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nIn 1939, Ruth Bryan Owen and her husband purchased \"The Cedars\", located at Alderson, West Virginia, and began making repairs. They sold the property in 1945. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\nOwen died July 26, 1954 in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was cremated. Her ashes were interred at Ordrup Cemetery, Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1992, Owen was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "155698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155698", "title": "Sales", "text": "Sales\n\nSales are activities related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period.\n\nThe \"seller\" or the provider of the goods or services complete a sale in response to an acquisition, appropriation, requisition or a direct interaction with the \"buyer\" at the point of sale. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the item, and the settlement of a price, in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The \"seller\", not the purchaser generally executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of payment. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a salesman or saleswoman or salesperson, but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including \"salesclerk\", \"shop assistant\", and \"retail clerk\".\n\nIn common law countries, sales are governed generally by the common law and commercial codes. In the United States, the laws governing sales of goods are somewhat uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, albeit with some non-uniform variations.\n\nA person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer or prospect. Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same \"coin\" or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages. It is implied that the selling process will proceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally rewarded. The stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each party's need for the other's item of value, and determining if the values to be exchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer's terms, \"worth the price\". Sometimes, sellers have to use their own experiences when selling products with appropriate discounts.\n\nFrom a management viewpoint it is thought of as a part of marketing, although the skills required are different. Sales often form a separate grouping in a corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives known as \"salespersons\" (singular: \"salesperson\"). Selling is considered by many to be a sort of persuading \"art\". Contrary to popular belief, the methodological approach of selling refers to a \"systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, by which a salesman relates his or her offering of a product or service in return enabling the buyer to achieve their goal in an economic way\". According to a 2018 survey of salespeople, selling has become more difficult in recent years due to changes in technology and general access to prospects. While the sales process refers to a systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, the definition of the selling is somewhat ambiguous due to the close nature of advertising, promotion, public relations, and direct marketing.\n\nSelling is the profession-wide term, much like marketing defines a profession. Recently, attempts have been made to clearly understand who is in the sales profession, and who is not. There are many articles looking at marketing, advertising, promotions, and even public relations as ways to create a unique transaction.\n\nTwo common terms used to describe a salesperson are \"Farmer\" and \"Hunter\". The reality is that most professional salespeople have a little of both. A hunter is often associated with aggressive personalities who use aggressive sales technique. In terms of sales methodology, a hunter refers to a person whose focus is on bringing in and closing deals. This process is called \"sales capturing\". An example is a commodity sale such as a long distance salesperson, shoe salesperson and to a degree a car salesperson. Their job is to find and convert buyers. A sales farmer is someone who creates sales demand through activities that directly influence and alter the buying process.\n\nMany believe that the focus of selling is on the human agents involved in the exchange between buyer and seller. Effective selling also requires a systems approach, at minimum involving roles that sell, enable selling, and develop sales capabilities. Selling also involves salespeople who possess a specific set of sales skills and the knowledge required to facilitate the exchange of value between buyers and sellers that is unique from marketing, advertising, etc.\n\nWithin these three tenets, the following definition of professional selling is offered by the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD):\nTeam selling is one way to influence sales. Team selling is \"a group of people representing the sales department and other functional areas in the firm, such as finance, production, and research and development\". (Spiro) Team selling came about in the 1990s through total quality management (TQM). TQM occurs when companies work to improve their customer satisfaction by constantly improving all of their operations.\n\nMarketing and sales differ greatly but generally have the same goal. Selling is the final stage in marketing which puts the plan into effect, which also includes pricing, promotion, place, and product (the 4 P's). A marketing department in an organization has the goals of increasing the desirability and value to the customer and increasing the number and engagement of interactions between potential customers and the organization. Achieving this goal may involve the sales team using promotional techniques such as advertising, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations, creating new sales channels, or creating new products (new product development), among other things. It can also include bringing the potential customer to visit the organization's website(s) for more information, or to contact the organization for more information, or to interact with the organization via social media such as Twitter, Facebook and blogs. Social values also play a major role in consumer decision processes. Marketing is the whole of the work on persuasion made for the whole of the target people. Sales are the persuasion and effort that from one person to one person (B2C), one person makes to the corporation (B2B) in the face or in the phone or in the digital environment, to make a living resource enter the company.\n\nThe field of sales process engineering views \"sales\" as the output of a larger system, not just as the output of one department. The larger system includes many functional areas within an organization. From this perspective, \"sales\" and \"marketing\" (among others, such as \"customer service\") label for a number of processes whose inputs and outputs supply one another to varying degrees. In this context, improving an \"output\" (such as sales) involves studying and improving the broader sales process, as in any system, since the component functional areas interact and are interdependent.\n\nMany large corporations structure their marketing departments so they are directly integrated with all lines of business. They create multiple teams with a singular focus and the managers of these teams must coordinate efforts in order to drive profits and business success. For example, an \"inbound\" focused campaign seeks to drive more customers \"through the door\", giving the sales department a better chance of selling their product to the consumer. A good marketing program would address any potential downsides as well.\n\nThe sales department would aim to improve the interaction between the customer and the sales facility or mechanism (example, website) or salesperson. As Sales is the forefront of any organization, this would always need to take place before any other business process may begin. Sales management would break down the selling process and then increase the effectiveness of the discrete processes as well as the interaction between processes. For example, in many out-bound sales environments, the typical process includes outbound calling, the sales pitch, handling objections, opportunity identification, and the close. Each step of the process has sales-related issues, skills, and training needs, as well as marketing solutions to improve each discrete step, as well as the whole process. In many cases becoming a salesperson is a default career as not many people aspire to be a salesman but rather fall into the job due to circumstances. It can be highly rewarding as you receive remuneration in the form of a salary and also commission.\n\nOne further common complication of marketing involves the inability to measure results for a lot of marketing initiatives. In essence, many marketing and advertising executives often lose sight of the objective of sales/revenue/profit, as they focus on establishing a creative/innovative program, without concern for the top or bottom lines – a fundamental pitfall of marketing for marketing's sake.\n\nMany companies find it challenging to get marketing and sales on the same page. The two departments, although different in nature, handle very similar concepts and have to work together for sales to be successful. Building a good relationship between the two that encourages communication can be the key to success – even in a down economy.\n\nThe idea that marketing can potentially eliminate the need for salespeople depends entirely on context. For example, this may be possible in some B2C situations; however, for many B2B transactions (for example, those involving industrial organizations) this is mostly impossible. Another dimension is the value of the goods being sold. Fast-moving consumer-goods (FMCG) require no sales people at the point of sale to get them to jump off the supermarket shelf and into the customer's trolley. However, the purchase of large mining equipment worth millions of dollars will require a salesperson to manage the sales process – particularly in the face of competitors. Small and medium businesses selling such large ticket items to a geographically-disperse client base use manufacturers' representatives to provide this highly personal service while avoiding the large expense of a captive sales force.\n\nAnother area of discussion involves the need for alignment and integration of corporate sales and marketing functions. According to a report from the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council, only 40 percent of companies have formal programs, systems or processes in place to align and integrate the two critical functions.\n\nTraditionally, these two functions, as referenced above, have operated separately, left in siloed areas of tactical responsibility. Glen Petersen's book \"The Profit Maximization Paradox\" sees the changes in the competitive landscape between the 1950s and the time of writing as so dramatic that the complexity of choice, price, and opportunities for the customer forced this seemingly simple and integrated relationship between sales and marketing to change forever. Petersen goes on to highlight that salespeople spend approximately 40 percent of their time preparing customer-facing deliverables while leveraging less than 50 percent of the materials created by marketing, adding to perceptions that marketing is out of touch with the customer and that sales is resistant to messaging and strategy.\n\nThere are two types of sales: direct selling and indirect selling.\n\nA sale can take place through:\n\n\nAgents in the sales process can represent either of two parties in the sales process; for example:\n\n\nIn the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act defines outside sales representatives as \"employees [who] sell their employer's products, services, or facilities to customers away from their employer's place(s) of business, in general, either at the customer's place of business or by selling door-to-door at the customer's home\" while defining those who work \"from the employer's location\" as inside sales. Inside sales generally involves attempting to close business primarily over the phone via telemarketing, while outside sales (or \"field\" sales) will usually involve initial phone work to book sales calls at the potential buyer's location to attempt to close the deal in person. Some companies have an inside sales department that works with outside representatives and book their appointments for them. Inside sales sometimes refers to upselling to existing customers.\n\n"}

George was the younger brother of James Burns (1789-1871), with whom he formed a partnership, J. & G. Burns. Together, they started sailing ships between Glasgow and Liverpool, as well as across the Atlantic to Canada and the United States. J. & G. Burns set up the regular steamer service to the Inner and Outer Hebrides. This was sold to David Hutcheson & Co in 1851, and by the mid-1870s, it formed the basis of David MacBrayne Ltd, which today operates as Caledonian MacBrayne across the west coast of Scotland.\n\nBurns was party to the consolidation of a number of companies, including the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, into the Cunard Line, which had been begun by Sir Samuel Cunard. The Cunard Line merged with the White Star Line in 1936, and was to launch liners such as the RMS \"Queen Mary\" (1936).

He founded the brand Stelbel in 1973.\n\nAt the end of World War II, at the age of 13, Stelio Belletti began working for his father Antenore Belletti in his workshop in via Giovanni Antonio Amadeo in the Ortica district of Milan, where they repaired and built tubular steel aircraft fuselages. \nThey produced fuselages for some important aeronautical companies in Milan, working for the most part with the Società Italiana Ernesto Breda where his father, Antenore Belletti, apprenticed in the years before the war started. \nIn the early years of working with his father, they receive important commissions from Fratelli Nardi and Caproni di Taliedo. \nIn the 50s, they established a relationship with the newly founded Aviamilano owned by Mario Vietri, who commissions a variety of projects from Belletti. The projects were often contracted through the engineer Stelio Frati, who regularly commissioned projects from the Belletti workshop, the majority of which were prototypes. One of the most important projects was the development of a fuselage for the F.8L Falco, a lightweight aircraft designed by Frati. They also built all the fuselages for the P.19 Aircraft, also for Aviamilano and designed by the engineer Ermenegildo Preti. \nThe Belletti Workshop, driven by the aviation industry, was one of the first in Italy to acquire TIG welding equipment from the American company Miller.\n\nTowards the end of the 50s, while continuing to work in the aviation industry, the Belletti Workshop began to establish important relationships in the motorcycle racing industry, working closely with Eng. Lino Tonti, building motorcycle frames for racing competitions. Some of the first frames were built for Paton in Milan, who they continued to work with until 1973. Paton motorcycles with Belletti frames, or replicas of the same, are identified with the initials BL, as can be seen in the BL3-R model which is still in production today. \nStarting in the 60s, other important brands such as Linto, Puch Frigerio, and Guazzoni begin to commission the Belletti family to build prototypes and special motorcycle frames for racing. \nOne of the most significant achievements within the motorcycle industry dates back to 1967. That year, Mike Hailwood was to take part in the World Championship with a Honda 500 GP, but after the initial testing carried out that winter, the road racer began to complain about the performance of the frame. In 1967, the engineers at the Japanese company had been focused on developing the engine (which turned out to be among the most powerful in the Championship) and consequently decided not to make any further changes to the chassis. Referred by specialist Giuseppe Pattoni, Hailwood approached Stelio and Antenore Belletti as a private customer and commissioned them to construct a new chassis for his Honda 500 GP. They completed the tubular-steel double cradle frame in just 16 days. \nThe Honda 500 GP motorcycle equipped with the new Belletti frame was used for the first time at the Mototemporada Romagnola, in the Rimini stage on May 14, 1967. The road racer won the race, breaking the winning streak of racer Giacomo Agostini who rode a MV Agusta. The motorcycle was also used in the World Championship while testing the Hockenheim circuit, but Honda forbade the use of the motorcycle during the race and for all subsequent races. \nIn 1968, they also began construction on a limited series of frames to equip the Gran Prix motorcycle Linto 500 GP; all the frames for this model were designed by Belletti’s friend, Lino Tonti, and built by Belletti. \nThe Belletti workshop continued to work in the motorcycle industry until the early 70s.\n\nStelio Belletti has been passionate about racing bicycles ever since he was a boy. Starting in the 70s, he began to race in local and amateur competitions with excellent results.\nSpurred by a dry-spell in his family’s workshop and the dissatisfaction he felt towards the most recent racing bicycle he had purchased, Stelio Belletti tried his hand at bicycle frame building. His results encouraged him to found the Stelbel brand in 1973. \nHaving honed his TIG welding skills while working in the aviation industry, he became the first Italian frame builder to build TIG welded frames. \nIn 1975, Stelio Belletti patented the first bicycle frame welded with TIG welding techniques in Italy and that same year produced the frames for the Polish national team, who went on to win the gold medal in the men’s team time trial race at the UCI Road World Championships in Mettet. \nBy the second half of the 70s, the Belletti workshop concentrated on the production of Stelbel bicycle frames, and gradually began to decrease their commitment in other areas of production. \nIn the early 80s, for age reasons, his father Antenore left the company to Stelio, and under his management the company hired additional employees. \n\nStelio Belletti is recognized to have been on the forefront of bicycle frame construction, always pushing the boundaries and experimenting with new solutions. He remembers being one of the first manufacturers to make stainless steel frames. \nBelletti continued to work in his family’s workshop until 1990 when the company closed. \nOver the following years, Belletti collaborated with other Italian brands producing TIG welded frames made with steel or aluminum tubing. \nUpon his retirement, Stelio Belletti has devoted his time to sports, participating in several cycling events, and even organizing some himself. \n\n\n"}

They were published by Kadokawa Shoten and Bunkasha, and were serialized in \"Weekly Gendai\", a weekly manga magazine targeting salarymen.\n\nThe first TV series broadcast on TV Asahi's \"Friday Night Drama\" slot from July 4, 2003 until September 19, 2003, and garnered an average rating of 12.0%, reaching a high point of 14.1% according to the Kantō Area Video Research group, the highest rating of any show in the \"Friday Night Drama\" slot. During the final episode of the first series, viewers were told that Tadano and Moriwaki were going to take a 15-month vacation traveling around to various onsen across Japan. A special titled \"Tokumei Kakarichō Tadano Hitoshi Returns\" was aired on December 22, 2004, just over 15 months since the final episode of the first series.\n\nOn January 14, 2005, the second series began airing, running through March 18, 2005. According to the Kantō Area Video Research group, the series achieved a 16.0% rating with the episodes airing on February 11 and 18. The final episode garnered a rating of over 20% in its timeslot, due largely to the main character, Tadano, collapsing during the episode due to being overworked. On August 7, 2005, the second special was aired, titled \"Nerawareta Serebu na Onna-tachi\". The special garnered a 19.3%, the second highest rating ever for a drama, and making it the most popular drama aired between August 1 and 7.\n\nThe third series began airing January 12, 2007.\n\nWhile in the original manga Tadano is a \"lone wolf\", in the TV series he works in combination with Moriwaki, a character created for the TV series. Moriwaki has now made his appearance in the original manga.\n\nBased on a comic by Kimio Yanagisawa, Tokumei Kakaricho Tadano Hitoshi is a story about salaried worker who leads a double life as inept manager at the company, but moonlights as a heavy for the chairman of the company, investigating corruption within and outside of the company.\n\nJin Tadano (Katsunori Takahashi) is an assistant manager of operations department. Most people calls him Hitoshi Tadano because Jin can be read as Hitoshi, and this rhymes with Tadano Hito (an ordinary person). He pretends to be useless employee, but that's just a guise to hide his true function within the company. He's really like a ninja working for the chairman of the Denoudo corporation, always on a secret assignment to protect the people and the projects that the company is involved with. He is looked down by most of his fellow employees as useless oaf, but few girls likes him for who he is. This includes the secretary of the chairman Noriko Tsubouchi (Atsuko Sakurai), TV broadcaster Mayuko Shinmizu (Rieko Miura), and his coworker Kazue Yamabuki (Yuri Ebihara).\n\nIn each episode he's involved in solving corruption, murder, kidnapping, and all sorts of problems the company and its clients gets involved with. The program is made for adult audience, and was aired during late night time slot. The theme and characters that appears in the story reflects this. There're humor, action, some sexuality, and intrigue that makes this an excellent drama series coming out of Japan.\n\n"}
{"id": "216238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216238", "title": "Value of life", "text": "Value of life\n\nThe value of life is an economic value used to quantify the benefit of avoiding a fatality. It is also referred to as the cost of life, value of preventing a fatality (VPF) and implied cost of averting a fatality (ICAF). In social and political sciences, it is the marginal cost of death prevention in a certain class of circumstances. In many studies the value also includes the quality of life, the expected life time remaining, as well as the earning potential of a given person especially for an after the fact payment in a wrongful death claim lawsuit.\n\nAs such, it is a statistical term, the cost of reducing the average number of deaths by one. It is an important issue in a wide range of disciplines including economics, health care, adoption, political economy, insurance, worker safety, environmental impact assessment, and globalization.\n\nIn industrial nations, the justice system considers a human life \"priceless\", thus illegalizing any form of slavery; i.e., humans cannot be bought at any price. However, with a limited supply of resources or infrastructural capital (e.g. ambulances), or skill at hand, it is impossible to save every life, so some trade-off must be made. Also, this argument neglects the statistical context of the term. It is not commonly attached to lives of individuals or used to compare the value of one person's life relative to another person's. It is mainly used in circumstances of saving lives as opposed to taking lives or \"producing\" lives.\n\nThere is no standard concept for the value of a specific human life in economics. However, when looking at risk/reward trade-offs that people make with regard to their health, economists often consider the value of a statistical life (VSL). The EPA does not place a dollar value on individual lives. Rather, when conducting a cost-benefit analysis of new environmental policies, the Agency uses estimates of how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that may be caused by environmental pollution.These estimates of willingness to pay for small reductions in mortality risks are often referred to as the value of a statistical life (VSL). The VSL is the value that an individual places on a marginal change in their likelihood of death. Note that the VSL is very different from the value of an actual life. It is the value placed on changes in the likelihood of death, not the price someone would pay to avoid certain death. This is best explained by way of an example. From the EPA's website:Suppose each person in a sample of 100,000 people were asked how much he or she would be willing to pay for a reduction in their individual risk of dying of 1 in 100,000, or 0.001%, over the next year. Since this reduction in risk would mean that we would expect one fewer death among the sample of 100,000 people over the next year on average, this is sometimes described as \"one statistical life saved.” Now suppose that the average response to this hypothetical question was $100. Then the total dollar amount that the group would be willing to pay to save one statistical life in a year would be $100 per person × 100,000 people, or $10 million. This is what is meant by the \"value of a statistical life.” Economists often estimate the VSL by looking at the risks that people are voluntarily willing to take and how much they must be paid for taking them. These types of studies, which look at a person's actual choices, are known as revealed preference studies. A common source of such choices is the labor market, where jobs with greater risk of death are seen to correlate with higher wages.\nMuch of this research uses a wage hedonic approach, which looks at how wages change with changes in job characteristics. Such studies regress wages on job characteristics like risk of death, occupation, industry, risk of injury, location, etc. By controlling for as many job characteristics as possible, researchers hope to tease out the portion of the wage that is compensating for the risk of death on the job. A recent summary of this literature is the 2003 paper by Viscusi and Aldy.\n\nAnother method economists can use to estimate the VSL is by simply asking people (e.g. through questionnaires) how much they would be willing to pay for a reduction in the likelihood of dying, perhaps by purchasing safety improvements. These types of studies are referred to as stated preference studies. A well known problem with this method is the so-called \"hypothetical bias\", whereby people tend to overstate their valuation of goods and services.\n\nVSL estimates from wage hedonics are what the EPA uses when evaluating health benefits from programs. From the EPA's:\n\nData for these studies frequently include wage data from the Current Population Survey and workplace risk data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. Both sets of data are collected on behalf of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nAs an example, the EPA's retrospective study of the clean air act, which focused \"primarily on the criteria pollutants sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, ozone, and lead\", found that the benefits of the program, mostly from improvements to health, outweighed the costs:\n\nThe value of improvements to health conditions were converted to dollars by estimating the resulting decrease in the incidence of fatalities and valuing this change using estimations of the VSL from the literature. A table of specific values used for the various improvements in health can be found in the report's executive summary.\n\nThe cigarette industry was particularly concerned with value of life calculations since it came under regular attack in the 1980s and 1990s for the \"social cost\" of smoking on the national economy. The economic argument for increasing excise taxes on cigarettes was that these taxes compensated the state for a whole range of externalities that smoking imposed, including the costs of hospital and medical care for smokers and non-smokers alike, disability pensions for smoking-related diseases, welfare payments made to surviving spouses, the cost of street, home and office cleaning, the burden of home and forest fires, etc. \n\nTo counter this argument, the tobacco industry was increasingly forced to fall back on calculations made by a network of employed academics, who were paid to write op-ed articles for their local newspapers expressing the opinion that smokers already 'paid their way'. They relied on an argument by Kip Viscusi which became known as the \"death benefits\"—the idea that, since smokers died earlier than non-smokers, the nation was being saved hospital, pension and nursing-home costs, and that these offset many of the external costs (depending on how these are calculated).\n\nSince resources are finite, trade-offs are inevitable, even regarding potential life-or-death decisions. The assignment of a value to individual life is one possible approach to attempting to make rational decisions about these trade-offs.\n\nWhen deciding on the appropriate level of healthcare spending, a typical method is to equate the marginal cost of the healthcare to the marginal benefits received. In order to obtain a marginal benefit amount, some estimation of the dollar value of life is required.\nHowever the level that can be done is limited by available resources. So even though it may be 'beneficial' to spend more it is not possible, or else requires deficit spending which causes other intended consequences that are hoped to be less.\n\nThe rational strategy is to determine how much can be spent on saving lives and then allocating it to the most beneficial ways until the money is fully allocated.\n\nIn risk management activities such as in the areas of workplace safety, and insurance, it is often useful to put a precise economic value on a given life. There can be no such thing as a perfectly safe or risk free system—one can always make a system safer by spending more money. However, there are diminishing returns involved.\n\nIn transportation modes it is very important to consider the external cost that is paid by the society but is not calculated, for making it more sustainable. The external cost, although consisting of impacts on climate, crops and public health among others, is largely determined by impacts on mortality rate.\n\nEquivalent parameters are used in many countries, with significant variation in the value assigned.\n\nIn Australia, the value of a statistical life has been set at:\n\nIn New Zealand, the value of a statistical life has been set at:\n\nAccording to different estimates life value in Russia varies from $40,000 up to $2 million. On the results of opinion poll life value (as the cost of financial compensation for the death) in the beginning of 2015 was about $71,500.\n\nThe following estimates have been applied to the value of life. The estimates are either for \"one year\" of additional life or for the statistical value of a \"single\" life.\n\nThe income elasticity of the value of statistical life has been estimated at 0.5 to 0.6. Developing markets have smaller statistical value of life. The statistical value of life also decreases with age.\n\nHistorically, children were not valued very much but modern cultural norms attach a much higher value.\n\n\n"}
