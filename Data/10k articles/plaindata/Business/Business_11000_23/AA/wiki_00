Studies show that money spent locally circulates back into the community three times as much when it is not spent with an absentee-owned business. Local currency has been implemented in some communities as a countermeasure to this effect. Neighborhood investment, in which members of the community are given opportunities to become partial owners of new developments, is another method.\n\nIn Brazil, studies found that more than a third of the profits generated from tourism were exported to absentee business owners. In Vietnam, the economic expansion of the 1990s was associated with a rise in absentee business owners. There has also been concern that tourism profits in Southern Africa go to absentee business owners. \n\nAbsentee business owners can be more vulnerable to theft by employees, especially when recordkeeping is turned over to employees, unless proper internal controls and review are implemented. In the United States, many business-owning military reservists have become absentee business owners during long tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n"}

The necessary quality for an asset is that value remains after the period of analysis so it can be used as a store of value. As such, financial instruments like corporate bonds and common stocks are assets because they store value for the next period. If the good or factor is used up before the next period, there would be nothing upon which to place a value.\n\nAs a result of this definition, assets only have positive futures prices. This is analogous to the distinction between consumer durables and non-durables. Durables last more than one year. A classic durable is an automobile. A classic non-durable is an apple, which is eaten and lasts less than one year. Assets are that category of output which economic theory places prices upon. In a simple Walrasian equilibrium model, there is but a single period and all items have prices. In a multi-period equilibrium model, while all items have prices in the current period. Only assets can survive into the next period and thus only assets can store value and as a result, only assets have a price today for delivery tomorrow. Items which depreciate 100% by tomorrow have no price for delivery tomorrow because by tomorrow it ceases to exist.\n\nThe subfield of asset pricing (or valuation) is the financial evaluation of the value of such assets; the primary method used by today's financial analysts is the discounted cash flow method. With this method, an asset's future cash flows are either assumed to be known with certainty (as in a treasury bond which is risk free) or estimated. These future cash flows are discounting used present values.\n\nThe Flow of Funds tables from the Federal Reserve System provide data about assets, which are tangible assets and financial assets, and liabilities. The difference, assets minus liabilities, is net worth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1578179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1578179", "title": "Business operations", "text": "Business operations\n\nThe outcome of business operations is the \"harvesting\" of value from assets owned by a business. Assets can be either \"physical\" or \"intangible\". An example of value derived from a physical asset, like a building, is rent. An example of value derived from an intangible asset, like an idea, is a royalty. The effort involved in \"harvesting\" this value is what constitutes business operations cycles.\n\nBusiness operations encompass three fundamental management imperatives that collectively aim to maximize value harvested from business assets (this has often been referred to as \"sweating the assets\"):\n\n\nThe three imperatives are interdependent. The following basic tenets illustrate this interdependency:\n\nThe business model of a business describes the means by which the three management imperatives are achieved. In this sense, business operations is the execution of the business model.\n\nThis is the most straightforward and well-understood management imperative of business operations. The primary goal of this imperative is to implement a \"sustained\" delivery of goods and services to the business's customers at a cost that is less than the funds acquired in exchange for said goods and also self employee services—in short, making a profit.\n\nThe funds directly acquired by the business in exchange for the goods and services it delivers is the business's revenue.\n\nThe cost of developing, producing, and delivering these goods and services is the business's expenses.\n\nA business whose revenues are sufficiently greater than its expenses makes profit or income. Such a business is profitable. As such, generating recurring \"revenue\" is not the focus of operations management; what counts is management of the relationship between the cost of goods sold and the revenue derived from their sale. Efficient processes that reduce costs even while prices remain the same expand the gap between revenue and expenses and derive higher profitability.\n\nTypes of recurring income-\n\nThe more profitable a business is, the more valuable it is. A business's profitability is measured on the basis of how much income it generates for the:\n\n\n\nA business that can harvest a significant amount of value from its assets but cannot \"demonstrate\" an ability to sustain this effort cannot be considered a viable business.\n"}
{"id": "775003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=775003", "title": "Cornering the market", "text": "Cornering the market\n\nIn finance, cornering the market consists of obtaining sufficient control of a particular stock, commodity, or other asset in an attempt to manipulate the market price. One definition of cornering a market is \"having the greatest market share in a particular industry without having a monopoly.\"\n\nCompanies that have cornered their markets have usually done so in an attempt to gain greater leeway in their decisions; for example, they may desire to charge higher prices for their products without fears of losing too much business. The cornerer hopes to gain control of enough of the supply of the commodity to be able to set the price for it.\n\nThis can be attempted through several mechanisms. The most direct strategy is to simply buy up a large percentage of the available commodity offered for sale in some spot market and hoard it. With the advent of futures trading, a cornerer may buy a large number of futures contracts on a commodity and then sell them at a profit after inflating the price.\n\nAlthough there have been many attempts to corner markets by massive purchases in everything from tin to cattle, to date very few of these attempts have ever succeeded; instead, most of these attempted corners have tended to break themselves spontaneously. Indeed, as long ago as 1923, Edwin Lefèvre wrote, \"very few of the great corners were profitable to the engineers of them.\" A cornerer can become vulnerable due to the size of the position, especially if the attempt becomes widely known. If the rest of the market senses weakness, it may resist any attempt to artificially drive the market any further by actively taking opposing positions. If the price starts to move against the cornerer, any attempt by the cornerer to sell would likely cause the price to drop substantially. In such a situation, many other parties could profit from the cornerer's need to unwind the position.\n\nCornering is a condition of market when most of the assets are held by a particular group of individuals in a market. It is an undesirable activity and may affect interest of other investors.\n\nAccording to Aristotle in \"The Politics\" (Book I Section 1259a), Thales of Miletus once cornered the market in olive-oil presses:\n\nThales, so the story goes, because of his poverty was taunted with the uselessness of philosophy; but from his knowledge of astronomy he had observed while it was still winter that there was going to be a large crop of olives, so he raised a small sum of money and paid round deposits for the whole of the olive-presses in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a low rent as nobody was running him up; and when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for a number of presses at the same time, and by letting them out on what terms he liked he realized a large sum of money, so proving that it is easy for philosophers to be rich if they choose.\"\n\nJournalist Edwin Lefèvre lists several examples of corners from the mid-19th century. He distinguishes corners as the result of manipulations from corners as the result of competitive buying.\n\nOne of the few cornerers whose rationale was published and justified, Cornelius Vanderbilt started accumulating shares of the Harlem Railroad in 1862 because he anticipated its strategic value. He took control of the Harlem Railroad and later explained that he wanted to show that he could take this railroad, which was generally considered worthless, and make it valuable. The corner of June 25, 1863 can be seen as just an episode in a strategic investment that served the public well.\n\nThe 1869 Black Friday financial panic in the United States was caused by the efforts of Jay Gould and James Fisk to corner the gold market on the New York Gold Exchange. When the government gold hit the market, the premium plummeted within minutes and many investors were ruined. Fisk and Gould escaped significant financial harm.\n\nIn chapter 19 of his book, Edwin Lefèvre tries to summarize the rationale for the corners of the 19th century.\nThe corner of The Northern Pacific Railway on May 9, 1901, is a well documented case of competitive buying, resulting in a panic. The 2009 Annotated Edition of \"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\" contains Lefèvre's original account in chapter 3 as well as modern annotations explaining the actual locations and personalities on the page margins.\n\nCalled \"a forerunner of the Livermore and Cutten operations of a few years later\" by historian Robert Sobel, the March 1920 corner of The Stutz Motor Company is an example of a manipulated corner ruining everyone involved, especially its originator Allan Ryan.\n\nIn the late 1950s, United States onion farmers alleged that Sam Seigel and Vincent Kosuga, Chicago Mercantile Exchange traders, were attempting to corner the market on onions. Their complaints resulted in the passage of the Onion Futures Act, which banned trading in onion futures in the United States and remains in effect .\n\nBrothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt attempted to corner the world silver markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at one stage holding the rights to more than half of the world's deliverable silver. During the Hunts' accumulation of the precious metal, silver prices rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to nearly $50 an ounce in January 1980. Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an ounce two months later, much of the fall occurring on a single day now known as Silver Thursday, due to changes made to exchange rules regarding the purchase of commodities on margin.\n\nRogue trader Yasuo Hamanaka, Sumitomo Corporation's chief copper trader, attempted to corner the international copper market over a ten-year period leading up to 1996. At one point during this \"Sumitomo copper affair,\" Hamanaka is believed to have controlled approximately 5% of the world copper market. As his scheme collapsed, Sumitomo was left with large positions in the copper market, ultimately losing US$2.6 billion. In 1997 Hamanaka pleaded guilty to criminal charges stemming from his trading activity and was sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nDuring the financial crisis of 2007-2010 Porsche cornered the market in shares of Volkswagen, which briefly saw Volkswagen become the world's most valuable company. Porsche claimed that its actions were intended to gain control of Volkswagen rather than to manipulate the market: in this case, while cornering the market in Volkswagen shares, Porsche contracted with naked shorts—resulting in a short squeeze on them. It was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to the resignation of Porsche's chief executive and financial director and to the merger of Porsche into Volkswagen.\n\nOne of the wealthiest men in Germany's industry, Adolf Merckle, committed suicide after shorting Volkswagen shares. \n\nOn July 17, 2010, Armajaro purchased 240,100 tonnes of cocoa. The buyout caused cocoa prices to rise to their highest level since 1977. The purchase was valued at £658 million and accounted for 7 per cent of annual global cocoa production. The transaction, the largest single cocoa trade in 14 years, was carried out by Armajaro Holdings, a hedge fund co-founded and managed by Anthony Ward. Ward was dubbed \"Chocfinger\" by fellow traders for his exploits. The nickname is a reference to both the Bond villain Goldfinger and a British confection.\n"}

As directors carry certain personal legal obligations to a corporation (for example, being responsible for any money held in trust for another person, e.g. sales taxes not remitted to a government), those seeking recourse against directors are allowed to rely on the directors register as proof that a director held office on any particular day.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, corporations are required to keep the list of directors up to date with the corporate affairs office where the corpororation was incorporated.

Kaiser-Frazer was prepared to invest half a million dollars and it would be Ilin's responsibility to invest the other two million dollars. In 1950, Ilin, who was unsure if the investment would be successful, traveled to Brooklyn, N.Y. to meet Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson for advice on the matter.

The term \"European patent\" is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However, a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents, subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited opposition procedure, which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and limitation and revocation procedures, which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.\n\nThe EPC provides a legal framework for the granting of European patents, via a single, harmonised procedure before the European Patent Office. A single patent application, in one language, may be filed at the European Patent Office in Munich, at its branch in The Hague, at its sub-office in Berlin, or at a national patent office of a Contracting State, if the national law of the State so permits.\n\nBefore 1978, two important problems when seeking to obtain patent protection in Europe in a number of countries were first the need to file a separate patent application in each country, with a subsequent distinct grant procedure in each country, and secondly the need to translate the text of the application into a number of different languages. Different languages are indeed utilised across the European countries and there is substantial expense in preparing translations into each of those languages. While the European Patent Convention does not totally overcome the need for translations (since a translation may be required after grant to validate a patent in a given EPC Contracting State), it does centralise the prosecution in one language and defers the cost of translations until the time of grant.\n\nIn September 1949, French Senator Henri Longchambon proposed to the Council of Europe the creation of a European Patent Office. His proposal, known as the \"Longchambon plan\", marked the beginning of the work on a European patent law aimed at a \"European patent\". His plan was however not found to be practicable by the Council's Committee of Experts in patent matters. The meetings of the Committee nevertheless led to two Conventions, one on the formalities required for patent applications (1953) and one on the international classification of patent (1954). The Council's Committee then carried on its work on substantive patent law, resulting in the signature of the Strasbourg Patent Convention in 1963.\n\nIn 1973, the \"Munich Diplomatic Conference for the setting up of a European System for the Grant of Patents\" took place and the Convention was then signed in Munich (the Convention is sometimes known as the \"Munich Convention\"). The signature of the Convention was the accomplishment of a decade-long discussion during which Kurt Haertel, considered by many as the father of the European Patent Organisation, and François Savignon played a decisive role.\n\nThe Convention entered into force on 7 October 1977 for the following first countries: Belgium, Germany (then West Germany), France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland and United Kingdom, and on 1 May 1978 for Sweden. However, the first patent applications were filed on 1 June 1978 (date fixed by the Administrative Council which held its first meeting on 19 October 1977). Subsequently, other countries have joined the EPC.\n\nThe EPC is separate from the European Union (EU), and its membership is different; Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Turkey, Monaco, Iceland, Norway, the Republic of Macedonia, San Marino, Albania and Serbia are members of the EPO but are not members of the EU. The Convention is, as of January 2015, in force in 38 countries. Serbia became the 38th state on 1 October 2010.\n\nA diplomatic conference was held in November 2000 in Munich to revise the Convention, amongst other things to integrate in the EPC new developments in international law and to add a level of judicial review of the Boards of Appeal decisions. The revised text, informally called the EPC 2000, entered into force on 13 December 2007.\n\nThroughout the history of the EPC, some non-contracting States have concluded cooperation agreements with the European Patent Organisation, known as extension or validation agreements. These states then became \"extension states\" or \"validation states\", which means that European patents granted by the EPO may be extended to those countries through the payment of additional fees and completion of certain formalities. Such cooperation agreements are concluded by the President of the European Patent Office on behalf of the European Patent Organisation pursuant to , are not based on a \"direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC\", and exist to assist with the establishment of national property rights in these states. As is the case in EPO contracting states, the rights conferred to European patents validated/extended to these states are the same as national patents in those states. However, the extension of a European patent or patent application to these states is \"not subject to the jurisdiction of the [EPO] boards of appeal.\"\n\nAs of January 2015, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro have extension agreements with the EPO so that, in effect, these states can be designated in a European patent application. Several other \"extension states\" have since become states parties to the EPC. Furthermore, so-called \"validation agreements\" with Morocco, Moldova, Tunisia, and Cambodia are also in effect since 1 March 2015, 1 November 2015, 1 December 2017, and 1 March 2018, respectively.\n\nThe European Patent Convention is \"a special agreement within the meaning of Article 19 of the Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, signed in Paris on 20 March 1883 and last revised on 14 July 1967, and a regional patent treaty within the meaning of Article 45, paragraph 1, of the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 19 June 1970.\" The European Patent Convention currently does not lead to the grant of centrally enforceable patents in all 38 countries, although the European Union patent would allow for unitary effect: centrally enforceability throughout 24 of the 27 countries of the European Union.\n\nThe content of the Convention includes several texts in addition to the main 178 articles. These additional texts, which are integral parts of the Convention, are:\n\nOne of the most important articles of the Convention, , entitled \"Patentable inventions\", states:\nThis article constitutes the \"fundamental provision of the EPC which governs the patentability of inventions\".<ref name=\"T 154/04-r6\"> Decision T 154/04 of 15 November 2006, Reasons 6, to be published at the Official Journal of the European Patent Office.</ref>\n\nHowever, the EPC provides further indications on what is patentable. There are exclusions under Article 52(2) and (3) EPC and exclusions under Article 53 EPC.\n\nFirst, discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, aesthetic creations, schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, programs for computers and presentations of information are not regarded as inventions and are excluded from patentability only to the extent that the invention relates to those areas \"as such\". This is \"a negative, non-exhaustive list of what should not be regarded as an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC.\" \"(For further information, see also: Software patents under the EPC).\"\n\nThe second set of exclusions, or exceptions, include\n\nThe Convention also includes provisions setting out filing requirements of European applications, the procedure up to grant, the opposition procedure and other aspects relating to the prosecution of patent applications under the Convention.\n\nEuropean patent applications may be filed in any language, but they are prosecuted only in one of the three official languages of the EPO – English, French and German. If an application is filed in a language other than an official language, a translation must be filed into one of the three official languages, within two months from the date of filing. The official language of filing (or of the translation) is adopted as the \"language of proceedings\" and is used by the EPO for communications.\n\nEuropean patent applications are prosecuted in a similar fashion to most patent systems – the invention is searched and published, and subsequently examined for compliance with the requirements of the EPC.\n\nDuring the prosecution phase, a European patent is a single regional proceeding, and \"the grant of a European patent may be requested for one or more of the Contracting States.\" An applicant for a European patent designates those Contracting States in which protection for the invention is desired, and the designations need to be \"confirmed\" later during the procedure through the payment of designation fees. Once granted by the EPO, a European patent comes into existence effectively as a group of national patents in each of the designated Contracting States.\n\nThere are only two types of centrally executed procedures after grant, the opposition procedure and the limitation and revocation procedures. The opposition procedure, governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent. It is a quasi-judicial process, subject to appeal, which can lead to maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute). National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.\n\nIn contrast to the unified, regional character of a European patent application, the granted European patent does not comprise, in effect, any such unitary character, except for the opposition procedure. In other words, one European patent in one Contracting State is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the opposition procedure.\n\nA European patent confers rights on its proprietor, in each Contracting State in respect of which it is granted, from the date of publication of the mention of its grant in the European Patent Bulletin. That is also the date of publication of the B1 document, i.e. the European patent specification. This means that the European patent is granted and confers rights in all its designated Contracting States at the date of mention of the grant, whether or not a prescribed translation is filed with a national patent office later on (though the right may later be deemed never to have existed in any particular State if a translation is not subsequently filed in time, as described below).\n\nA translation of a granted European patent must be filed in some EPC Contracting States to avoid loss of right. Namely, in the Contracting States which have \"prescribe[d] that if the text, in which the European Patent Office intends to grant a European patent (...) is not drawn up in one of its official languages, the applicant for or proprietor of the patent shall supply to its central industrial property office a translation of this text in one of its official languages at his option or, where that State has prescribed the use of one specific official language, in that language\". The European patent is \"void ab initio\" in a designated Contracting State where the required translation (if required) is not filed within the prescribed time limit after grant. In other Contracting States, no translation needs to be filed, for example in Ireland if the European patent is in English. In those Contracting States where the London Agreement is in force the requirement to file a translation of the European patent has been entirely or partially waived. If a translation is required, a fee covering the publication of said translation may be due as well.\n\nAlmost all attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, except for the opposition procedure, limitation procedure, and revocation procedure as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive attributes of a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions. Thus, almost all post-grant proceedings – including renewal, revocation proceedings (when initiated by somebody else than the proprietor), and infringement enforcement are determined under national law.\n\nEPO Boards of Appeal decisions are not precedential at all upon national courts, which have exclusive jurisdiction on validity and infringement after a European patent has been granted (except during the 9-month opposition period, which can only relate to validity). However, national courts will tend to take note, and may find 'persuasive', decisions of the EPO Boards, though they can disagree with them.\n\nInfringement is remitted almost entirely to national law and to national courts. In one of its very few substantive interventions into national law, the EPC requires that national courts must consider the \"direct product of a patented process\" to be an infringement. The \"extent of the protection\" conferred by a European patent is determined primarily by reference to the claims of the European patent (rather than by the disclosure of the specification and drawings, as in some older patent systems), though the description and drawings are to be used as interpretive aids in determining the meaning of the claims. A \"Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC\" provides further guidance, that claims are to be construed using a \"fair\" middle position, neither \"strict, literal\" nor as mere guidelines to considering the description and drawings, though of course even the protocol is subject to national interpretation. The authentic text of a European patent application and of a European patent are the documents in the language of the proceedings.\n\nAll other substantive rights attached to a European patent in a Contracting State, such as what acts constitute infringement (indirect and divided infringement, infringement by equivalents, extraterritorial infringement, infringement outside the term of the patent with economic effect during the term of the patent, infringement of product claims by processes for making or using, exports, assembly of parts into an infringing whole, etc.), the effect of prosecution history on interpretation of the claims, remedies for infringement or bad faith enforcement (injunction, damages, attorney fees, other civil penalties for wilful infringement, etc.), equitable defences, coexistence of an EP national daughter and a national patent for identical subject matter, ownership and assignment, extensions to patent term for regulatory approval, etc., are expressly remitted to national law.\n\nFor a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all EP jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the European Court of Justice. In two cases in July 2006 interpreting Articles 6.1 and 16.4 of the Brussels Convention, the European Court of Justice held that European patents are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was \"unavoidable\" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available.\n\nValidity is also remitted largely to national law and national courts. limits the application of national law to only the following grounds of invalidity, and specifies that the standards for each ground are those of national law:\n\n\nA national court may partially invalidate a European patent in a Contracting State, e.g., by revoking only some claims, or by permitting amendment to the claims, the description or the drawings, as allowed by national law.\n\nA European patent is also non-unitary in that it may be revoked in one Contracting State while maintained in another. However, a national court in one Contracting State may not revoke a European patent in another Contracting State.\n\nThe EPC requires all jurisdictions to give a European patent a term of 20 years from the filing date, the filing date being the actual date of filing an application for a European patent or the date of filing of an international application under the PCT designating the EPO. The filing date is not necessarily the priority date, which can be up to one year earlier. The term of a granted European patent may be extended under national law if national law provides term extension to compensate for pre-marketing regulatory approval. For EEA member states this is by means of a supplementary protection certificate.\n\nA European patent application may result from the filing of an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), i.e. the filing of a PCT application, and then the entry into \"European regional phase\", i.e. the transition from the international to the European procedural stages. The European patent application is therefore said to be a \"Euro-PCT application\" and the EPO is said to act as a designated or elected Office. In case of conflict between the provisions of the EPC and those of the PCT, the provisions of the PCT and its Regulations prevail over those of the EPC.\n\nTwelve EPC Contracting States, namely Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Monaco, the Netherlands and Slovenia have \"closed their national route\". This means that it is no longer possible to obtain a national patent protection through the international (PCT) phase without entering into the regional European phase and obtaining a European patent. Lithuania closed its \"national route\" most recently, on 4 September 2014.\n\n\n\n"}

One of his classmates there was Auguste Lumière, who was later one of the inventors of the cinematographe. After studying weaving and dying technology for eight years, Inabata returned to Japan in 1885 and, after teaching others about what he learned, started his own company, Inabata Senryōten (later Inabata & Co., Ltd.), in 1890. He later moved the company to Osaka and focused his business on dying military uniforms. Achieving success, Inabata later served as president of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OCCI) from 1922 to 1934, and became a member of the House of Peers. A bronze statue of him still stands in front of the OCCI. Inabata was also instrumental in the founding of the Institut Franco-Japon du Kansai (currently l’Institut français du Japon – Kansai) in 1926.\n\nWhen Inabata returned to France in 1896, he met Lumière again and learned about the motion picture apparatus that he and his brother Louis had developed. Interested in the business opportunity, Inabata returned to Japan with a cinematographe, fifty reels of film, and François-Constant Girel, a Lumière technician. They then offered \"the first paid exhibition of what was then called 'jido shashin' [moving pictures]\" at the Nanchi Theater in Osaka on 15 February 1897. Although Thomas Edison's kinetoscope had been presented in Kobe the previous year, that was not a device for projecting motion pictures, so Inabata's screening is regarded as Japan's \"first projected film programme\". Since the cinematographe could both project and shoot motion pictures, Inabata was also the first Japanese to be involved in the shooting of films, some of which featured him and his family. He soon found the film business distasteful, however, and handed it over to Einosuke Yokota, who later founded Yokota Shōkai, one of Japan's first film studios.\n"}

Mooney\n\nJames David Mooney (18 February 1884 – 21 September 1957) was an engineer and corporate executive at General Motors who played a role in international affairs in the 1930s and early 1940s. His career was disrupted when he was accused of Nazi sympathies in 1940.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, Mooney attended the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, and in 1908 received a B.S. in Mining and Metallurgy.\n\nAfter graduating he went on gold mining expeditions in Mexico and California. From 1910 to 1917 Mooney worked at Westinghouse Electric, B. F. Goodrich and the Hyatt Roller Bearing Company, which later became part of General Motors. He steadily rose in the management ranks.\n\nIn 1917 he enrolled in the army, and served in France as a captain with the 309th Ammunition Regiment, 159th Field Artillery.\n\nAfter the war Mooney was appointed President and General Manager of Delco Remy, a General Motors subsidiary. In 1922 Mooney was made President of General Motors Overseas, responsible for operations around the world.\n\nHe traveled widely, visiting his division's factories in many different countries. Mooney was an early leader in managerial theory, recording his theories and real-life experiences in the widely read \"Onward Industry\" (1931), reissued in a revised edition as \"The Principles of Organization\". He succeeded in applying American approaches to a great range of conditions in other countries.\n\nMooney met leading government officials and other members of the elite in the countries he visited, discussing local and global economic issues.\nHe was awarded the German Order of Merit of the Eagle in 1938. In May 1939 he met Nazi officials in Germany and discussed various issues concerning GM's Adam-Opel facility.\n\nHe arranged for a meeting in London between Helmuth Wohlthat, who was working for Hermann Göring on a four-year plan for the German economy, and ambassador Joseph Kennedy. The purpose was to discuss possible loans in exchange for more open trade conditions. In December 1939 and January 1940 he met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt and obtained authority for informal discussions with the Germans to better understand their goals. In March 1940 Mooney met first with Adolf Hitler and then with Göring. He presented Roosevelt's views to both men, and recorded their replies.\n\nThe German lawyer and businessman Gerhardt Alois Westrick visited the United States between March and August 1940. \nAccording to Charles Higham in his book \"Trading with the Enemy\", Sosthenes Behn of ITT arranged the trip and persuaded Torkild Rieber, CEO of Texaco, to look after Westrick's local needs. \nWestrick represented many American companies in Germany including ITT, Ford, General Motors, Standard Oil, the Texas Company, Sterling Products, and the Davis Oil Company.\nOn 26 June 1940, one day after the surrender of France, Rieber sponsored a celebratory dinner for Westrick at the Waldorf Astoria New York. Attendees included Sosthenes Behn of ITT, James D. Mooney, Edsel Ford of the Ford Motor Company and Philip Dakin Wagoner of Underwood.\n\nHostile accounts of the dinner were published by the \"Chicago Daily News\", \"Time\", \"Life\", and the \"New York Herald Tribune\".\nEarly in August 1940 the recently founded \"PM Magazine\" published a series of articles that attacked Mooney for his contacts with the Nazis.\nThe magazine accused him of pro-German views and criticized a speech he had made, later printed as an article in the \"Saturday Evening Post\", entitled \"War or Peace in America?\"\n\nIn 1940 Mooney resigned from his position as President of General Motors Overseas to head a small team of directors charged with gearing up GM for wartime production. Mooney worked in the Production Engineering Section of the Bureau of Aeronautics.\n\nGeorge S. Messersmith, United States Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Cuba, wrote a report on 4 March 1941 that criticized Mooney's negative views of England. He considered that Mooney was \"dangerous ... for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to be associated with.\" The Windsors visited Mooney in Detroit in November 1941, the month before the Attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nLater Mooney joined the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations. Mooney returned to GM after the war, but in 1946 left to head up Willys-Overland Motors as Chairman and President. James David Mooney died in Tucson, Arizona on 21 September 1957 at the age of 73.\n\n\nJames D. Mooney Papers:\n\n"}

{"id": "171951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171951", "title": "Martin Luther King Jr. Day", "text": "Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day (officially Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.) is an American federal holiday marking the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. It is observed on the third Monday of January each year, which is around King's birthday, January 15. The holiday is similar to holidays set under the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. The earliest Monday for this holiday is January 15 and the latest is January 21.\n\nKing was the chief spokesperson for nonviolent activism in the Civil Rights Movement, which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law. The campaign for a federal holiday in King's honor began soon after his assassination in 1968. President Ronald Reagan signed the holiday into law in 1983, and it was first observed three years later. At first, some states resisted observing the holiday as such, giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays. It was officially observed in all 50 states for the first time in 2000.\n\nThe idea of Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday was promoted by labor unions in contract negotiations. After King's death, U.S. Representative John Conyers (a Democrat from Michigan) and U.S. Senator Edward Brooke (a Republican from Massachusetts) introduced a bill in Congress to make King's birthday a national holiday. The bill first came to a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979. However, it fell five votes short of the number needed for passage. Two of the main arguments mentioned by opponents were that a paid holiday for federal employees would be too expensive, and that a holiday to honor a private citizen would be contrary to longstanding tradition (King had never held public office). Only two other figures have national holidays in the U.S. honoring them: George Washington and Christopher Columbus.\n\nSoon after, the King Center turned to support from the corporate community and the general public. The success of this strategy was cemented when musician Stevie Wonder released the single \"Happy Birthday\" to popularize the campaign in 1980 and hosted the Rally for Peace Press Conference in 1981. Six million signatures were collected for a petition to Congress to pass the law, termed by a 2006 article in \"The Nation\" as \"the largest petition in favor of an issue in U.S. history.\"\n\nSenators Jesse Helms and John Porter East (both North Carolina Republicans) led opposition to the holiday and questioned whether King was important enough to receive such an honor. Helms criticized King's opposition to the Vietnam War and accused him of espousing \"action-oriented Marxism\". Helms led a filibuster against the bill and on October 3, 1983, submitted a 300-page document to the Senate alleging that King had associations with communists. New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan declared the document a \"packet of filth\", threw it on the Senate floor and stomped on it.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan originally opposed the holiday, citing cost concerns. When asked to comment on Helms' accusations that King was a communist, the president said \"We'll know in thirty-five years, won't we?\", in reference to the eventual release of FBI surveillance tapes that had previously been sealed. But on November 2, 1983, Reagan signed a bill, proposed by Representative Katie Hall of Indiana, to create a federal holiday honoring King. The bill had passed the House of Representatives by a count of 338 to 90, a veto-proof margin. The holiday was observed for the first time on January 20, 1986.\n\nThe bill also established the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission to oversee observance of the holiday, and Coretta Scott King, King's wife, was made a member of this commission for life by President George H. W. Bush in May 1989.\n\nAlthough the federal holiday honoring King was signed into law in 1983 and took effect three years later, not every U.S. state chose to observe the holiday at the state level until 1991, when the New Hampshire legislature created \"Civil Rights Day\" and abolished \"Fast Day\". In 2000, Utah became the last state to have a holiday named after King when \"Human Rights Day\" was officially changed to \"Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\"\n\nIn 1986, Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, created a paid state MLK holiday in Arizona by executive order just before he left office, but in 1987, his Republican successor Evan Mecham, citing an attorney general's opinion that Babbitt's order was illegal, reversed Babbitt's decision days after taking office. Later that year, Mecham proclaimed the third Sunday in January to be \"Martin Luther King Jr./Civil Rights Day\" in Arizona, albeit as an unpaid holiday. In 1990, Arizona voters were given the opportunity to vote on giving state employees a paid MLK holiday. That same year, the National Football League threatened to move Super Bowl XXVII, which was planned for Arizona in 1993, if the MLK holiday was voted down. In the November election, the voters were offered two King Day options: Proposition 301, which replaced Columbus Day on the list of paid state holidays, and Proposition 302, which merged Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays into one paid holiday to make room for MLK Day. Both measures failed to pass, with only 49% of voters approving Prop 302, the more popular of the two options; although some who voted \"no\" on 302 voted \"yes\" on Prop 301. Consequently, the state lost the chance to host Super Bowl XXVII, which was subsequently held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. In a 1992 referendum, the voters, this time given only one option for a paid King Day, approved state-level recognition of the holiday.\n\nOn May 2, 2000, South Carolina governor Jim Hodges signed a bill to make King's birthday an official state holiday. South Carolina was the last state to recognize the day as a paid holiday for all state employees. Prior to this, employees could choose between celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day or one of three Confederate holidays.\n\nWhile all states now observe the holiday, some did not name the day after King. For example, in New Hampshire, the holiday was known as \"Civil Rights Day\" until 1999, when the State Legislature voted to change the name of the holiday to Martin Luther King Day.\n\nSeveral additional states have chosen to combine commemorations of King's birthday with other observances:\n\nOverall, in 2007, 33% of employers gave employees the day off, a 2% increase over the previous year. There was little difference in observance by large and small employers: 33% for firms with over 1,000 employees; and, 32% for firms with under 1,000 employees. The observance is most popular among nonprofit organizations and least popular among factories and manufacturers. The reasons for this have varied, ranging from the recent addition of the holiday, to its occurrence just two weeks after the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, when many businesses are closed for part or sometimes all of the week. Additionally, many schools and places of higher education are closed for classes; others remain open but may hold seminars or celebrations of King's message. The observance of MLK Day has led to some colleges and universities extending their Christmas break to include the day as part of break. Some factories and manufacturers used MLK Day as a floating or movable holiday.\n\nThe national Martin Luther King Day of Service was started by former Pennsylvania U.S. Senator Harris Wofford and Atlanta Congressman John Lewis, who co-authored the King Holiday and Service Act. The federal legislation challenges Americans to transform the King Holiday into a day of citizen action volunteer service in honor of King. The federal legislation was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on August 23, 1994. Since 1996, Wofford's former state office director, Todd Bernstein, has been directing the annual Greater Philadelphia King Day of Service, the largest event in the nation honoring King.\n\nSeveral other universities and organizations around the U.S., such as Arizona State University, Greater DC Cares and City Year, participate in the Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service. In honor of MLK, hundreds of Volunteer Centers, and volunteers across the country donate their time to make a difference on this day.\n\nThe only other official national day of service in the U.S., as designated by the government, is September 11 National Day of Service (9/11 Day).\n\nOne place outside the U.S. where Martin Luther King Jr. Day is observed in the Japanese city of Hiroshima under mayor Tadatoshi Akiba, who holds a special banquet at the mayor's office as an act of unifying his city's call for peace with King's message of human rights.\n\nThe City of Toronto, in Ontario, Canada, is another city that has officially recognized Martin Luther King Jr. Day, although not as a paid holiday: all government services and businesses remain open.\n\nIn 1984, during a visit by the U.S. Sixth Fleet, Navy chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff conducted the first Israeli presidential ceremony in commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, held in the President's Residence, Jerusalem. Aura Herzog, wife of Israel's then-President Chaim Herzog, noted that she was especially proud to host this special event, because Israel had a national forest in honor of King, and that Israel and King shared the idea of \"dreams\". Resnicoff continued this theme in his remarks during the ceremony, quoting the verse from Genesis, spoken by the brothers of Joseph when they saw their brother approach, \"Behold the dreamer comes; let us slay him and throw him into the pit, and see what becomes of his dreams.\" Resnicoff noted that, from time immemorial, there have been those who thought they could kill the dream by slaying the dreamer, but – as the example of King's life shows – such people are always wrong.\n\nEvery year, since 1986, the Dr. Martin Luther King Tribute and Dinner is held in Wassenaar, The Netherlands. The Tribute includes young people and veterans of the Civil Rights Movement as well as music. it always ends with everyone holding hands in a circle and singing \"We Shall Overcome.\" The Tribute is held on the last Sunday in January and bridges Dr. King's birthday and Black History Month.\n\n1985–2100\n\n\n\n"}

Most MRP systems are software-based, but it is possible to conduct MRP by hand as well.\n\nAn MRP system is intended to simultaneously meet three objectives:\n\n\nPrior to MRP, and before computers dominated industry, reorder point (ROP)/reorder-quantity (ROQ) type methods like EOQ (economic order quantity) had been used in manufacturing and inventory management.\n\nMRP was created initially to supply the Polaris program then, in 1964, as a response to the Toyota Manufacturing Program, Joseph Orlicky developed material requirements planning (MRP). The first company to use MRP was Black & Decker in 1964, with Dick Alban as project leader. Orlicky's 1975 book \"Material Requirements Planning\" has the subtitle \"The New Way of Life in Production and Inventory Management\". By 1975, MRP was implemented in 700 companies. This number had grown to about 8,000 by 1981.\n\nIn 1983, Oliver Wight developed MRP into manufacturing resource planning (MRP II). In the 1980s, Joe Orlicky's MRP evolved into Oliver Wight's manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) which brings master scheduling, rough-cut capacity planning, capacity requirements planning, S&OP in 1983 and other concepts to classical MRP. By 1989, about one third of the software industry was MRP II software sold to American industry ($1.2 billion worth of software).\n\nIndependent demand is demand originating outside the plant or production system, while dependent demand is demand for components. The bill of materials (BOM) specifies the relationship between the end product (independent demand) and the components (dependent demand). MRP takes as input the information contained in the BOM.\nThe basic functions of an MRP system include: inventory control, bill of material processing, and elementary scheduling. MRP helps organizations to maintain low inventory levels. It is used to plan manufacturing, purchasing and delivering activities.\n\n\"Manufacturing organizations, whatever their products, face the same daily practical problem - that customers want products to be available in a shorter time than it takes to make them. This means that some level of planning is required.\"\n\nCompanies need to control the types and quantities of materials they purchase, plan which products are to be produced and in what quantities and ensure that they are able to meet current and future customer demand, all at the lowest possible cost. Making a bad decision in any of these areas will make the company lose money. A few examples are given below:\n\n\nMRP is a tool to deal with these problems. It provides answers for several questions:\n\nMRP can be applied both to items that are purchased from outside suppliers and to sub-assemblies, produced internally, that are components of more complex items.\n\nThe data that must be considered include:\n\n\nThere are two outputs and a variety of messages/reports:\n\n\nMessages and reports:\n\nWell-known methods to find order quantities are:\n\nMRP can be expressed as an optimal control problem:\nWhere \"x' \" is local inventory (the state), \"z\" the order size (the control), \"d\" is local demand, \"k\" represents fixed order costs, \"c\" variable order costs, \"h\" local inventory holding costs. δ() is the Heaviside function. Changing the dynamics of the problem leads to a multi-item analogue of the dynamic lot-size model.\n\n\nSource:\n\n\nIn 2011, the third edition of \"Orlicky's Materials Requirements Planning\" introduced a new type of MRP called \"demand driven MRP\" (DDMRP). The new edition of the book was written, not by Orlicky himself (he died in 1986) but by Carol Ptak and Chad Smith at the invitation of McGraw Hill to update Orlicky's work.\n\nDemand driven MRP is a multi-echelon formal planning and execution technique with five distinct components:\n\nThese five components work together to greatly dampen, if not eliminate, the nervousness of traditional MRP systems and the bullwhip effect in complex and challenging environments. The Demand Driven Institute claims the following: In utilizing these approaches, planners will no longer have to try to respond to every single message for every single part that is off by even one day. This approach provides real information about those parts that are truly at risk of negatively impacting the planned availability of inventory. DDMRP sorts the significant few items that require attention from the many parts that are being managed. Under the DDMRP approach, fewer planners can make better decisions more quickly. That means companies will be better able to leverage their working and human capital as well as the huge investments they have made in information technology. One down-side, however, is that DDMRP can not run on the majority of MRPII/ERP systems in use today, so organisations will have to implement a compatible system in order to run DDMRP. \n\nDDMRP has been successfully applied to a variety of environments including CTO (configure to order), MTS (make to stock), MTO (make to order) and ETO (engineer to order). The methodology is applied differently in each environments but the five step process remains the same. DDMRP leverages knowledge from theory of constraints (TOC), traditional MRP & DRP, Six Sigma and lean. It is effectively an amalgam of MRP and kanban techniques. As such, it incorporates the strengths of both but also the weaknesses of both; hence its limited adoption.\n\nAdditional references are included below. \n\n"}

Specifically, \"poetaster\" has implications of unwarranted pretensions to artistic value. The word was coined in Latin by Erasmus in 1521. It was first used in English by Ben Jonson in his 1600 play \"Cynthia's Revels\"; immediately afterwards Jonson chose it as the title of his 1601 play \"Poetaster.\" In that play the \"poetaster\" character is a satire on John Marston, one of Jonson's rivals in the Poetomachia or War of the Theatres.\n\nWhile \"poetaster\" has always been a negative appraisal of a poet's skills, \"rhymester\" (or \"rhymer\") and \"versifier\" have held ambiguous meanings depending on the commentator's opinion of a writer's verse. \"Versifier\" is often used to refer to someone who produces work in verse with the implication that while technically able to make lines rhyme they have no real talent for poetry. Rhymer on the other hand is usually impolite despite attempts to salvage the reputation of rhymers such as the Rhymers' Club and Rhymer being a common last name.\n\nThe faults of a poetaster frequently include errors or lapses in their work's meter, badly rhyming words which jar rather than flow, oversentimentality, too much use of the pathetic fallacy and unintentionally bathetic choice of subject matter. Although a mundane subject in the hands of some great poets can be raised to the level of art, such as \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" by John Keats or \"\" by Thomas Gray, others merely produce bizarre poems on bizarre subjects, an example being James McIntyre, who wrote mainly of cheese.\n\nOther poets often regarded as poetasters are William Topaz McGonagall, Julia A. Moore, Edgar Guest, Dmitry Khvostov, and Alfred Austin. Austin, despite having been a British poet laureate, is nevertheless regarded as greatly inferior to his predecessor, Alfred Lord Tennyson; he was frequently mocked during his career and is little read today. The American poet Joyce Kilmer (1886–1918), known for his 1913 poem \"Trees\", is often criticized for his overly sentimental and traditional verse written at the dawn of Modernist poetry, although some of his poems are frequently anthologized and retain enduring popular appeal. \"Trees\" has been parodied innumerable times, including notably parody by Ogden Nash.\n\nMusician Joanna Newsom on the album \"The Milk-eyed Mender\" uses the term to refer to a struggling narrator wracked with ambition to create beautiful poetry in a verse from \"Inflammatory Writ\":\n\nRapper Big Daddy Kane uses an adjectival form as an insult in his song \"Uncut, Pure\":\n\nThe band Miracle Fortress has a song entitled \"Poetaster\".\n\nIn the sense that a poetaster is a pretended poet, John Marston coined the term \"parasitaster,\" for one who pretends to be a parasite or sycophant, in his play \"Parasitaster, or The Fawn\" (1604).

His father is the entrepreneur Ramón Báez Romano, grandson of former president Ramón Báez Machado.\n\nHe married María Rosa Zeller Barrous, they had 2 children and divorced. On 12 January 1997, he remarried to Patricia Álvarez DuBreil, the granddaughter of the industrialist Horacio Álvarez Saviñón and cousin-niece of Luis Álvarez Renta, at Casa de Campo in a pompous, ostentatious wedding that cost more than US$ 2 million of the time (US$ million at prices) —in a country whose GDP per capita was around US$2,000— it was called the \"Wedding of the Century\"; they divorced in 2013. He married for a third time in June 2014 to Sandra Martínez Yangüela.\n\nHe was the CEO of Banco Intercontinental (BANINTER) from 1993 until its collapse in 2003; he and his father controlled at least 80% of the shares. He was lionized as the Dominican \"King Midas\".\n\nIn 2001, BANINTER alone was worth RD$25.57 billion or US$1.51 billion (US$ billion in prices).\n\nBáez Figueroa was arrested May 15, 2003 along with BANINTER vice presidents Marcos Báez Cocco and Vivian Lubrano de Castillo, the secretary of the Board of Directors, Jesús M. Troncoso, and financer Luis Álvarez Renta, on charges of bank fraud, money laundering and concealing information from the government as part of a massive fraud scheme of more than RD$ 55 billion (USD $2.2 billion). This sum would be big anywhere, but it was overwhelming for the Dominican economy, equivalent to two-thirds of its national budget.\n\nThe resulting central bank bailout spurred 30 percent annual inflation and a large increase in poverty. The government was forced to devalue the peso, triggering the collapse of two other banks, and prompting a US$ 600 million (420 million €) loan package from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe banking crisis ignited harsh fights over the bank group’s media outlets, including the prominent newspaper Listín Diario, which was temporarily seized and run by the Mejía administration following the BANINTER collapse.\n\nMoreover, it was prompted, as detailed at length in the trial that opened in April 2006, by a scandal involving debt writeoffs and sweetheart loans or other financial deals suspected of having favored leading politicians and others.\n\nRumors that Baninter might have been in trouble began circulating during fall of 2002, and depositors started to withdraw their savings. The Dominican Central Bank stepped in to support the bank by providing new lines of credit. Anxious for a more permanent solution, the government announced in early 2003 that Banco del Progreso, run by Pedro Castillo, the brother of Mr. Mejía’s son-in-law, would acquire Baninter. But Banco del Progreso abruptly withdrew from the deal. Government officials said that two-thirds of the money that customers had deposited in Baninter was kept off its official books by a custom-designed software system. Banking regulators and the bank’s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, were deceived for years.\n\nIn April 2003, the government took control of Baninter. Mr. Báez Figueroa’s family owned more than the 80% of the bank, and soon after, a deeper examination supported by the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank, revealed the scale of the meltdown.\n\nWith 350 prosecution and defense witnesses slated to testify, ex-President Hipólito Mejía among them, the criminal proceedings against Mr. Báez Figueroa began on April 2, 2006. However, the Collegiate Court decided to postpone the first hearing for May 19, 2006, accepting a motion by the defense lawyers.\n\nOn October 21, 2007, after the long trial that concluded on September, Báez Figueroa was sentenced by a three-judge panel to 10 years in prison. Additionally, he was ordered to pay restitution and damages totalling more than $31 million. The laundering charges were excluded, but another suspected mastermind of the fraud, financier Luis Álvarez Renta, was convicted and sentenced for money laundering to 10 years in prison. Marcos Báez Cocco, ex-vicepresident of the Bank, was also found guilty, but his sentence will be read on November 16.\n\nTheir defence attorneys said they would appeal.\n\nThe accusations against two other defendants, Báez’s personal assistant and former Baninter vicepresident Vivian Lubrano, as well as the secretary of the Baninter Board of Directors Jesús M. Troncoso, were dismissed for lack of evidence.\n\nFriends of Báez Figueroa, groping to explain the shortcuts he took in running BANINTER, pointed to his political connections and a lack of competent managers at the bank. Báez Figueroa's lawyer, Marino Vinicio Castillo, said in an interview that the whole affair had been trumped up for political reasons, and that the claim that RD$55 billion had been embezzled was \"a fable.\" Castillo went on to say that \"very dark interests within the government that are blinded by ambition\" were behind his client's imprisonment. He accused the government of wanting to dismember BANINTER and divide the spoils. PricewaterhouseCoopers had audited Baninter's books for years and approved them \"without any reservations,\" Mr. Castillo said. \n\nHis defenders also say former President Mejía saw Báez Figueroa as a threat to his personal wealth and political influence and to Mejía's ambition to win another term in office. Taking control of BANINTER's media properties and using them to win over public opinion, not cleaning up a scandal, was what the government was after.\n\nEven after his arrest Báez Figueroa remained a central figure in the country's elite, readily accessible even in jail. Within days of his arrest, he received visits from president Leonel Fernández and Hatuey de Camps, then president of the Dominican Revolutionary Party.\n"}

A more recent emphasis has been on differences from the unequal dispersion of technological progress.\n\nThe growth of international trade is an aspect of globalization in the later 20th Century (see OECD), which has affected international relations. Increased international trade from the removal of trade barriers has narrowed income distribution among some nation states.

{"id": "887903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=887903", "title": "Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke", "text": "Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke\n\nRichard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (of the first creation), Lord of Leinster, Justiciar of Ireland (113020 April 1176) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman notable for his leading role in the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. Like his father, Richard fitz Gilbert has since become commonly known by his nickname Strongbow (Norman French: \"Arc-Fort\") which may be a mistranscription or mistranslation of Striguil.\n\nHis son Gilbert de Striguil, or Strigoil, died unmarried before 1189. As a minor, he never became an earl, thus the earldom was passed with Richard's daughter Isabel to her spouse William Marshall.\n\nRichard's cognomen Strongbow has become the name he is best known by, but it is unlikely that he was called that at the time. Cognomens of other Cambro-Norman and Norman lords were exclusively Norman-French as the nobility spoke French and, with few exceptions, official documents were written in Latin during this period. The confusion seems to have arisen when Richard's name was being translated into Latin. In the Domesday Exchequer annals between 1300 and 1304 (over 120 years after his death) it was written as \"\"Ricardus cognomento Stranghose Comes Strugulliae\" (Richard known as Stranghose earl of Striguil).\" This chronicler erroneously has attributed Stranghose (foreign leggings) as a cognomen, where it is much more likely a variant spelling or mistranscription of Striguil, which is called Strangboge, Stranboue or Stranbohe in other transcriptions. It is in the fourteenth century that we have Richard's name finally rendered as Strongbow \"Earl Richard son of Gilbert Strongbow [earl of Shropshire].\"\n\nRichard was the son of Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Isabel de Beaumont. Richard's father died in about 1148, when he was roughly 18 years old, and Richard inherited the title 'count of Strigoil' Earl of Pembroke. It is probable that this title was not recognized at Henry II's coronation in 1154. As the son of the first 'earl', he succeeded to his father's estates in 1148, but was deprived of the title by King Henry II of England in 1154 for siding with King Stephen of England against Henry's mother, the Empress Matilda. Richard was in fact, called by his contemporaries Count Striguil, for his marcher lordship of Striguil where he had a fortress at a place now called Chepstow, in Monmouthshire on the River Wye. He saw an opportunity to reverse his bad fortune in 1168 when he met Diarmait Mac Murchada, the deposed King of Leinster.\n\nIn 1167, Diarmait Mac Murchada (Dermot MacMurrough) was deprived of the Kingdom of Leinster by the High King of Ireland – Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair. The grounds for the dispossession were that Mac Murchada had, in 1152, abducted Derbforgaill, the wife of the King of Breifne, Tiernan O'Rourke (). To recover his kingdom, Mac Murchada solicited help from the King of England – Henry II. The deposed king embarked for Bristol from near Bannow on 1 August 1166. He met Henry in Aquitaine in the Autumn of 1166. Henry could not help him at this time, but provided a letter of comfort for willing supporters of Mac Murchada's cause in his kingdom. However, after his return to Wales, he failed to rally any forces to his standard. He eventually met the count of Striguil (nicknamed \"Strongbow\") and other barons of the Welsh Marches. Mac Murchada came to an agreement with Richard de Clare: for the Earl's assistance with an army the following spring, he could have Aoife, Mac Murchada's eldest daughter in marriage and the succession to Leinster. As Henry's approval or licence to Mac Murchada was a general one, the count of Striguil thought it prudent to obtain Henry's specific consent to travel to Ireland: he waited two years to do this. The licence he got was to aid Mac Murchada in the recovery of his kingdom of Leinster.\n\nMac Murchada and Richard de Clare raised a large army, which included Welsh archers and arranged for Raymond FitzGerald (also known as Raymond \"le Gros\") to lead it. The force took the Ostman towns of Wexford, Waterford, and Dublin in rapid succession between 1169 and 1170. Richard de Clare, however, was not with the first invading party and arrived later, in August 1170.\n\nIn May 1171, Diarmait Mac Murchada died and his son, Donal MacMurrough-Kavanagh (), claimed the kingdom of Leinster in accordance with his rights under the Brehon Laws. Richard de Clare also claimed the kingship in the right of his wife. At this time, Strongbow sent his uncle, Hervey de Montmorency, on an embassy to Henry II. This was necessary to appease the King who was growing restive at the count's increasing power. Upon his return, de Montmorency conveyed the King's terms – the return of Richard de Clare's lands in France, England, and Wales as well as leaving him in possession of his Irish lands. In return, Richard de Clare surrendered Dublin, Waterford, and other fortresses to the English king. Henry's intervention was successful and both the Gaelic and Norman lords in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule; Richard de Clare also agreed to assist Henry II in his coming war in France.\n\nHenry crossed over to Ireland in October 1172 and stayed in Ireland six months. He put his own men into nearly all the important places, Richard keeping only Kildare. In 1173 Richard went in person to France to help Henry II during the rebellion by his sons, being reinstated in Leinster as a reward. In 1174 he advanced into Connaught and was severely defeated, but fortunately Raymond FitzGerald re-established his supremacy in Leinster.\n\nBy an unknown mistress, Richard de Clare fathered two daughters:\n\nOn about 26 August 1171 in Waterford, Richard de Clare married MacMurrough's daughter, Aoife MacMurrough (anglicised as \"Eva\"). Their children were:\nKing Henry II had promised Sir William Marshal that he would be given Isabel as his bride, and his son Richard I upheld the promise one month after his ascension to the throne. The earldom was given to her husband as her consort. Marshall was the son of John the Marshal, by Sibylle, the sister of Patrick, Earl of Salisbury.\n\nRichard de Clare died in June 1176 of some type of infection in his leg or foot. He was buried in Holy Trinity Church in Dublin with his uncle-in-law, Lawrence, Archbishop of Dublin, presiding. King Henry II took all of Strongbow's lands and castles for himself and placed a royal official in charge of them. He guarded well the inheritance of Isabel. Eve was given her dower rights and possibly held Striguil [Chepstow] as part of those dower rights until the Welsh rebellion of 1184/85. There is a record of Eve confirming a charter in Ireland in 1188/89 as \"comtissa de Hibernia\".\n\nRichard de Clare's widow, Aoife, lived on and was last recorded in a charter of 1188.\n\nThere are no known extant records of the personal lives of Richard de Clare and Eve. We know that this young red-haired son of Gilbert de Clare Earl of Pembroke survived the years of being deprived of his rightful inheritance. He took the gamble that Dermot MacMurchada offered. He conquered and re-constituted his inherited lordship of Leinster, married the golden-haired Eve, and re-gained the respect of king Henry II. Two interesting questions arise for which there is no known extant contemporary records. Did Richard de Clare perhaps meet the man who would be his daughter's husband in the 1173 rebellion of the young King Henry? Would Richard de Clare have approved of the knight William Marshal who married his daughter Isabel and not only regained all the land, castles and titles that Richard de Clare should have inherited, but added greatly to them?\n\nRichard de Clare was the statesman, whereas Raymond was the soldier, of the conquest. He is vividly described by Giraldus Cambrensis as \"His complexion was somewhat ruddy and his skin freckled; he had grey eyes, feminine features, a weak voice, and short neck. For the rest, he was tall in stature, and a man of great generosity and of courteous manner.\" He was first interred in Dublin's Christ Church Cathedral where an alleged effigy can be viewed. Richard de Clare's actual tomb-effigy was destroyed when the roof of the Cathedral collapsed in 1562. The one on display dates from around the 15th century, bears the coat of arms of an unknown knight, and is the effigy of another local knight. Richard de Clare was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin within sight of the cross according to an eyewitness, Giraldus Cambrensis. There is little evidence to support the tradition that he was buried either in St Edan's Cathedral, Ferns, Christ Church Cathedral, Waterford or Dominican priory, Kilkenny. References to 'de Clare' being buried in Gloucester cathedral refer to his father, while those to 'Strongbow' in Tintern abbey refer probably to Walter or Anselm Marshall, both of whom died in 1245.\n\nRichard de Clare is an ancestor of the American Bush political family.\n\nThe English cider brand Strongbow is named after him.\n\n\n"}

His brother was Henry Fourdrinier, his later partner in business.\n\nAround the end of the 18th century Sealy and his brother were approached by John Gamble and Leger Didot, who were seeking financial support to develop an automatic paper making machine developed in Paris by Louis-Nicolas Robert, an employee of Didot. In 1801–02 the Fourdriniers entrusted engineer Bryan Donkin (then working with John Hall) with the development of Robert’s model into a prototype continuous paper-making machine. The world's first production machine was installed at Frogmore Paper Mill in Apsley, Hertfordshire in 1803 and a second, much improved and larger machine installed the following year. By 1810 eighteen machines had been installed at various mills.\n\nThe cost of developing and improving the machines was of the order of £60,000 and although the inventions were covered by various patents taken out by the Fourdrinier brothers, the costs of manufacture, installation and maintenance and the difficulty of collecting royalties forced the Sealy brothers to declare themselves bankrupt in 1810.\n\nThe machines themselves, known as Fourdrinier machines, were very successful and continued to be made in considerable numbers by Donkins.

(spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością) are determined by Article 163 KSH (Kodeks spółek handlowych). It first requires the notarization of the articles of incorporation. It must take place in Poland. The conclusion of the articles of incorporation creates a legal capacity subject, the company prior registration.\n\nThe second step requires the full payment of the share capital as codified by the articles of incorporation. Where required the payment includes the agreed surplus over the nominal value of the company share.\n\nThe share capital may be covered by cash or contribution in kind. Inalienable rights, e.g. work or services cannot place as a deposit in a Sp. z o.o.\n\nThe third step is the appointment of the board and possibly other organs of the Sp. z o.o.. The Board of Directors or the first board members can already be appointed at formation. Once all deposits are paid in full, the board may register for entry into the business register. The application is inter alia accompanied by a statement of all board members that the deposits were placed to cover the common stock in full by all shareholders in the company. The registration of the company in the business register takes about two to four weeks. By registering the company in the business register, the company becomes a legal entity. After registration in the business register, the Board of Directors has to request the so-called REGON number at the statistics agency. This is issued within one to two days. Subsequently the Board of Directors has to register the company at the company's financial authorities and obtain the so-called \"NIP\"-Number (Taxpayer Identification Number) and the VAT number.\n\nThe granting of the NIP requires the submission of a lease or other proof that the company has any accommodation, also a bank account contract is required. For these reasons it is recommended that already with formation the Board of Directors is appointed. In this way, in the start-up phase before registration in the business register the company is already able to open a bank account and sign a lease agreement.\n\nThe minimum content to be regulated the articles of incorporation determines Article 157 KSH. The articles of incorporation must contain information about the name of the company, place of business, the subject of the activity, the amount of registered capital, an indication of whether a shareholder is allowed to take over one or more company shares, the number and the nominal value of the company shares of each of the shareholders are taken and the duration of the company, if it is determined. Beyond the minimum content the shareholders are free to regulate their relationship to each other or to the company more extensive.\n\nNotable costs are first of all the notary fees, which are calculated in dependence to the share capital. If the share capital amounts e.g. 8000 zloty (about 2,000 EUR), the maximum amount to pay is 100 zloty plus 3% on the difference between share capital and 3000 zloty, consequently 3% of 5000 zloty. In result of this the total costs for the notary would be 250 zloty (about 62 EUR). In addition the value added tax (VAT) at the legal rate from the current 23% has to be added.\n\nFurthermore, costs incur associated with registering the company in the business register and the publication in for this responsible \"monitor Gospodarczy i Sądowy\" in the amount of approximately 1500 zloty (about 370 EUR). Finally, within 14 days after formation of the articles of incorporation, the so-called tax on civil law transactions (PCC) is to pay. This is 0.5% of the share capital.\n\nThe share capital amounts to at least 5,000 zloty (about 1,230 EUR). The shares can either be of equal or unequal height, depending on the articles of incorporation. If a shareholder can have more than one share, the shares must be equal and indivisible. The minimum nominal value of a share amounts to 50 zloty (approx. €12.5). The Polish legislator has various instruments to ensure the protection of creditors.\n\nThe share capital must be maintained throughout the life of the company. It may be reduced only in the manner allowed by law, e.g. through a capital reduction. The ban also applies to the hidden distribution of profits. A payment from the required share capital covering the company's assets is not possible for the shareholders under any title.\n\nThe shareholders are also prohibited from referring to or from the assets contributed their rightful share interest. Claims of the shareholder from a granted loan of the Sp. z o.o. applies as a contribution to the company if the loan was granted within two years before the insolvency of the Sp. z o.o.. In addition, Article 14 § 4 KSH contains a setoff of maturing share payments.\n\nThe access rights of the shareholders at the company's assets are generally restricted to the distribution of certain portion of the profits.\n\nThe capital increase is governed by Articles 255 ff. KSH. Basically, the increase in share capital demanded the change of the articles of incorporation. This requires a notarized resolution of the shareholders' meeting and the entry into the business register. Without changing the articles of incorporation, the capital increase can be carried out only if this is expressly permitted by the articles of incorporation. The exact height to which the share capital can be raised and the exact date to which the increase take place is also a requirement have to be regulated.\n\nThe capital increase is carried out either by increasing the nominal value of existing shares or by issuing new shares (ordinary capital increase). In case of the ordinary capital increase the company's assets is increased by the new deposits, which is provided from the old or new shareholders.\n\nIn principle, the existing shareholders are entitled to acquire the new shares. The take-over declaration needs to be notarized. In the case of the nominal capital increase the share capital will be increased by retained earnings or capital reserves.\n\nThe capital reduction of share capital requires changing the articles of incorporation in general as well. The shareholders may decide either the recovery of shares or the reduction of the share value. The reduction decision has to determine the amount of the share capital reduction and the way by which the capital should be reduced.\n\nThe minimum share capital and the minimum nominal value of shares may not be affected by the reduction. The reduction of the share capital needs to declare immediately to the creditors of the company with the request to object within three months, if they do not agree with the reduction. Creditors, which contradict the deadline, are generally to be satisfied by the company or have to obtain an appropriate security for their claim.\n\nEach corporate action becomes effective upon its entry into the business register, and thus has a constitutive effect.\n\nThe board consists of one or more individuals. To the board may be appointed both shareholders and third parties. Board members may be foreigners or persons resident abroad. The members of the Board are appointed and dismissed by resolution of the shareholders, unless the articles of incorporation provides otherwise, such as the appointment by the Supervisory Board.\n\nBoard members are generally appointed for one year. An excess of this one-year term of office may also be agreed. The term of office generally terminates with the date of holding of the shareholders’ meeting, which approved the financial statements for the last full financial year of the exercise of Executive Function. Board members are also free to withdraw from its role as manager.\n\nUnless otherwise agreed in the articles of incorporation, a board member can be dismissed at any time. However, the claims arising from the employment relationship persist.\n\nThe Board conducts the business of the Sp. z o.o. and represents it externally. The legal representative of a board member cannot be confined in an external legal effect. The articles of incorporation certainly may determine the way of representation.\n\nThe legal base case therefore regulates by a multi-person board that for issuing statements on behalf of the Sp. z o.o. the interaction of two board members or one board member along with a registered manager is required.\n\nThe Supervisory Board performs the constant, the Auditing Committee the periodic supervision over the affairs of the Company. The appointment of a Supervisory Board or Audit Commission at a Sp. z oo, in which the capital stock amounts more than 500,000 zloty (approx. 125.000 €) and also more than 25 existing shareholders, is mandatory. Otherwise the shareholders are responsible for an agreement in the articles of incorporation on the appointment of a supervisory board or audit commission. Both organs consist of at least three members who are appointed or dismissed by shareholders' resolution. The duties and responsibilities of those supervisory organs include the annual audit and the examination of the annual report of the Board of Directors.\n\nFinally, there is to mention the shareholders meeting. The shareholders' meeting is equipped with extensive skills and at the same time the supreme decision-making body of the Sp. z o.o.. By operation of law, the decisions on important matters are reserved to the shareholders' meeting. The competencies include the examination and approval of the annual report of the Board of Directors, the statement of profit and loss, the approval of the Board of Directors, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Commission, any decision on repayment of additional contributions, the sale or lease out of a company and the appointment of limited real rights on it.\n\nThe main duties of the shareholders include the provision of full deposit, the compensation of excessive determined contributions in kind and the reimbursement of unjustified payments (Art. 175, 198 KSH). Under the special relation of the articles of incorporation may accrue the following duties: acquisition of administrative or supervisory duties, the obligation to recurring contributions in kind (Art. 176 KSH) or to pay further margins (Article 177 KSH).\n\nToward the property rights primarily belongs the right to receive dividends (Art. 192 KSH), the subscription rights (Article 258 KSH), the participation of the net profits (Art. 191 ff KSH) and the settlement proceeds (Article 286 KSH), a claim for contributions in kind (Art. 176 KSH) and the repayment of the deposit for capital reduction and cancellation of the share and the right for repayment of unused further margins (Article 179 KSH).\n\nThe administrative rights include especially the participation of corporate resolutions (Art. 227 ff KSH), the appeal of such resolutions (Article 250 KSH), minority protection, the action for dissolution of the Company and to the expulsion of shareholders (Article 271 No. 1, 266 § 1 KSH) and the individual right to obtain information and control of each shareholder (Art. 212 KSH, which can only be restricted or excluded if the appointment of a supervisory body is provided, Article 213 § 3 KSH).\n\nDeviation from the equality in principle envisaged in terms of rights and duties of all shareholders may be prerogatives recognized under the special relation of the articles of incorporation. In particular, those prerogatives may affect the right to vote (more than three votes per share) and the right to dividend (maximum of 150% of the dividend to be paid to a non-privileged share).\n\nThe dissolution of a Sp. z o.o and the associated deletion in the business register takes place after carrying out the liquidation. Further steps are governed by Article 274 ff. KSH. Causes for dissolution may result from the law as well as the articles of incorporation. Notable examples: Resolution of the shareholders to dissolve the company or to transfer the registered office abroad, the announcement of the insolvency of the company as well as a verdict of a court.\n\nThe legal basis of the insolvency of a Sp. z o.o. regulates the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Law of 2003. The bankruptcy must be applied if the company is illiquid, means the company is unable pay their liabilities.\n"}

Bin Sulayem is currently involved in Seven Tides International, a diversified Real Estate Investment and Development Company in Dubai UAE. On 30 May 2007 Bin Sulayem became the Chairman of DP World.\n\nThe Sulayem family has been one Dubai's most prominent business and political families since at least the early 20th century. Ahmed bin Sulayem's father was a key advisor to Dubai's ruling Maktoum family. A son of his, Ahmed bin Sulayem, is also prominent in business.\n\nBin Sulayem's first job after graduating from college in the late 1970s was as a customs inspector at Dubai's then sleepy port. He told Fortune Magazine in 2008 that his future career was set when a man mistakenly came into his office one day and in the course of chatting suggested that Dubai could serve as an entrepot for the tea trade if it created a tax-free zone at the port. That chance meeting encouraged him to travel the world studying tax-free trading zones. When he returned home he approached Dubai's future ruler and family friend Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum with a proposal to build a free trade zone at the port. \"If you really believe in it, you go run it.\" Bin Sulayem said Sheikh Mohammed told him. \"I was 30.\"\n\nThat conversation led to Bin Sulayem serving as the first chairman of the Dubai government's tax-free Jebel Ali Free Zone when it was founded in 1985.\n\nSince the 1980s, Bin Sulayem has been one of the most prominent businessmen in Dubai, with a string of government-linked ventures. In addition to chairing Dubai World he helped found Nakheel, one of the UAE's largest property developers and Istithmar, a major investment holding company in Dubai. Both companies are Dubai World subsidiaries. \n\nHe also served on the board of the Investment Corporation of Dubai, the emirate's sovereign wealth fund, until November, 2009, when Bin Sulayem was removed from that post in the wake of the debt crisis that struck Dubai that year. In late 2009 and early 2010, Dubai was struggling to pay $80 billion in debt, most of it linked to Dubai World and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's influential \"Heard on the Street\" column said in October 2009 that Dubai World \"has just been radically restructured after running up almost $60 billion of liabilities on ill-judged acquisitions like struggling Madison Avenue retailer Barneys and the Queen Elizabeth II liner, which has since largely languished in a Dubai dry dock\" and that \"surprisingly, senior management remains in place, including Sultan bin Sulayem, the chairman who masterminded the expansion.\"\" Sulayem was finally removed from his post in December, 2010 and was replaced by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, a member of the royal family.\n\nHe received a B.S. in economics from Temple University of Philadelphia, the United States. \n\nHe was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Middlesex University in Dubai\n"}

It starts by the Pacific Ocean just west of Pacific Avenue in Marina del Rey, and ends far to the east in the city of Whittier, on Whittier Boulevard. It is south of Venice Boulevard for most of its length. At Wade Street, Washington Place is formed adjacent and parallel and lasts until just east of Sepulveda Boulevard, where it merges back into Washington Boulevard. Washington merges into Culver Boulevard briefly, but forms back into its own street at Canfield Avenue.\n\nWashington Boulevard, which is four lanes, primarily passes through locations in the mid southern portion of Los Angeles County. The communities to the west include affluent areas such as Marina del Rey and Ladera Heights. Further east it passes between Crestview and Culver City and through Mid City, Arlington Heights, Pico Union, City of Commerce, Montebello, Pico Rivera, Los Nietos and Whittier. Washington Boulevard is the dividing line between the neighborhood Venice in Los Angeles and Marina del Rey.\n\nIn 1905, when the road was known as Washington Street, it boasted the headquarters of the local horse driving club, for a mile west of Western Avenue. \"The road is not of the best,\" reported the \"Los Angeles Times,\" \"and automobiles are usurping it . . . but it is the nearest approach to a speedway the reinsmen have, and they therefore make the most of it.\" Mayor Owen McAleer \"has set aside that stretch of the highway to those drivers who delight in vying with each other off the racetrack, and policemen have been given to understand that some latitude is to be allowed horsemen there.\"\n\nWashington Boulevard provides bus service between Venice Beach and West LA Transit Center by Culver City Transit line 1, between West LA Transit Center and Downtown by Metro Local line 35, and east of Downtown by Montebello Transit line 50. A portion of the Metro Blue line runs along Washington Boulevard (serving the Grand/LATTC, San Pedro and Washington stations), from Flower Street to Long Beach Avenue, while the Metro Expo Line serves a rail station near the intersection with National Boulevard.\n\nThe entire route is in Los Angeles County. There are no postmiles because the street is maintained by local jurisdictions and not Caltrans.\n\n"}
