Borgward\n\nCarl Friedrich Wilhelm Borgward (November 10, 1890 in Altona, Hamburg – July 28, 1963 in Bremen) was a German engineer and designer and the creator of the Borgward group, based in Bremen.\n\nHe was of modest extraction, the son of a coal retailer, Wilhelm Borgward, and had twelve brothers and sisters. He undertook mechanical engineering studies, and obtained his engineering diploma from Hanover Technical University in 1913.\n\nHe was wounded during World War I. In 1919 he became one of the partners of \"Bremer Reifenindustrie\". The company was restructured and in 1920 became \"Bremer Kühlerfabrik Borgward & Co.\n\nIn 1924 and 1925 the company started to produce the small three-wheel trucks \"Blitzkarren\" and \"Goliath\". With his partner Wilhelm Tecklenborg, in 1928 he created the company \"Goliath-Werke Borgward & Co\". When the two associates took over \"Hansa-Lloyd-Werke\" in 1931, this became the Borgward Group.\n\nOn September 23, 1938, the \"Carl F. W. Borgward Automobil- und Motorenwerke\" factory was opened in Sebaldsbrück near Bremen. At that time, 22,000 people were working in the company. Until the end of the war the production of Borgward was mostly military vehicles and trucks.\n\nWhen the factory was destroyed by bombing in 1944, half of the workers were prisoners of war and forced laborers. Carl Borgward was interned until 1948. Finally, just one year after being freed, he was already again a member of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bremen.\n\nIn 1949, the first \"Lloyd LP 300\" had been designed and produced. In Germany this car was nicknamed the \"Leukoplastbomber\" (\"Band-aid Bomber\"). The small car with a plywood body on a wooden chassis had a two-stroke engine and was in the market segment under the Volkswagen Beetle, and kept this position for more than a decade.\n\nIn 1949 Borgward had also presented the large Hansa sedan, which was the first European car with a pontoon body. He had taken ideas from American magazines, which he read when under detention.\n\nThe largest success came in 1954 with the Borgward Isabella. The Borgwards met the spirit of the time: the German customers wished for American type styling and rich chrome decoration with European compact dimensions. Borgward participated in detail in the design of all the car models.\n\nIncreased competition on the segment of mid-sized cars, and the too broad and uneconomical range of models, as well as wrong financial and tactical choices by the management, led the company into crisis at the end of the fifties. The new model Borgward-Lloyd Arabella should have eased the difficulties, but it was handicapped by quality problems.\n\nIn 1961, Borgward underwent one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in the history of Germany. The company went to the Land of Bremen, which had it liquidated, and part of the factory went to Hanomag. Years after the bankruptcy was closed, it came out that it had not been reasonable: All debts had been paid to the last cent.\n\nCarl Borgward died of a heart attack at the age 72 on July 28, 1963.\n\nHis life work might continue: 50 years after closing down his grandson, Christian Borgward, together with his partner Karlheinz L. Knöss and with assistance from Chinese investors unveiled the company's first new car in over 40 years, the BX7 at the 2015 International Motor Show in Frankfurt.\n\n"}
{"id": "29677138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29677138", "title": "Catalinas Norte", "text": "Catalinas Norte\n\nCatalinas Norte is an important business complex composed of nineteen commercial office buildings, in two sections, and occupied by numerous leading Argentine companies, foreign subsidiaries, diplomatic offices, and a hotel. It is located in the Retiro and San Nicolás wards of the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nFrancisco Seeber, a German Argentine businessman and legislator, created The Catalinas Warehouses and Pier Company, Ltd. in 1872 for the purpose of building a pier (near Paraguay Street), a wharf, and an office building. The acquired lands were east of the Paseo de Julio (now Leandro Alem Avenue).\n\nThe area was known as the \"Catalinas Incline,\" and was so named for the Church of Santa Catalina of Sienna (still standing on the corner of Viamonte and San Martín streets). This church also served as the namesake for Seeber's new firm. With the purchase of more land in the quarter of La Boca, the Retiro lot was named \"Catalinas Norte\" (North Catalinas), and the La Boca lot, \"Catalinas Sur\".\n\nThe firm obtained a municipal contract for the construction of the Catalina Docks. Needing a large and steady supply of soil to level and grade the hitherto flood-prone site for the wharf, Seeber bought land in the then-desolate northwest end of the city with the intent of hauling soil to Catalinas for land reclamation. Enlisting workers mostly from Entre Ríos Province, these latter established a neighborhood (Villa Urquiza) there in 1887. \n\nThese docks became the northern and southern points of entry into Puerto Madero upon its inaugural in 1897. Catalinas Norte was later chosen as the site for the Hotel de Inmigrantes, a facility built to temporarily house the over 100,000 annual immigrant arrivals, and completed in 1911. Following the construction of the modern Port of Buenos Aires from 1911 to 1925, both Catalinas docks fell into disuse, and October 31, 1945, the Catalinas Warehouses properties were sold to Yatahí, S.A. A lot facing Córdoba Avenue was, in turn, resold in 1949 to a State enterprise created during the administration of Juan Perón: Atlas, S.A. This entity built the Alas Building, and an adjacent lot was used to build the Peronist ALEA publishing house (redeveloped as Microsoft's South American headquarters in 2000).\n\nThe bulk of the land, totaling 39,110 m² (429,000 ft²), north of these buildings continued vacant for decades. A further 24,200 m² (260,000 ft³) were owned by Otto Bemberg and Company, which opened the Retiro Park (an amusement park) there in 1939; the rest was later mostly used as parking lots.\n\nThe underutilized state of an area so close to the financial and administrative center of the city prompted the Municipal Department of Planning in 1956 to draft an urban renewal plan for the district. This envisaged the construction of a highway that would extend from Tigre to La Plata, as well as rezoning Catalinas to allow for the construction of office buildings of up to 70 floors. This district, per these plans, would ultimately be known as the \"Catalinas Gateway\" to Buenos Aires.\n\nThe City Office of Regulatory Planning (OPRBA) further specified, in its revised master plan of 1958, that construction of skyscrapers in downtown Buenos Aires would be prohibited, and limited these to the Catalinas district. Mayor Hernán Giralt presented a project to the City Council for the development of \"an area of hotels, an office and retail center, a location for shipping companies and air travel, a recreation center and a large area for parking,\" and on February 3, 1960, the Argentine National Congress authorized the City to purchase land north of Catalinas for the purpose.The Catalinas Norte Commission was established in 1961, but a subsequent political and economic crisis caused the project to stall and ultimately be discarded.\n\nThe coup d'état that toppled President Arturo Illia in 1966 led to the dissolution of OPRBA. Mayor Eugenio Schettini instructed the Municipal Department of Architecture and Urbanism (MCBA) to design a new, simpler plan that would limit permits for office high rises. A municipal ordinance in 1967 parceled the land inaccordance to the 1958 master plan, and lots were sold to Aerolíneas Argentinas, Conurban S.A, IBM, Sideco, Kokourek S.A, SEGBA (the state-owned city electric utility), Sheraton, and the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA). Retiro Park was bulldozed, and the Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens therein were relocated to their present, Palermo Woods location. The MCBA, in turn, retained four areas, opened three parking lots, and built two promenades: \"Carlos Della Paolera\" and \"Ingeniero Butty\".\n\nGround was broken on the first buildings in the complex, the Kokourek Group's Conurban Tower (in April 1969), and the Sheraton Buenos Aires Hotel & Convention Center, on June 26. Work began on the Carlos Pellegrini Tower for the UIA in 1970, and on the Catalinas Norte Tower (for Sideco) in 1972. The Conurban Tower was inaugurated in 1973, Carlos Pellegrini in 1974, and Catalinas Norte, in 1975. Work then began on the Madero Tower (so named for its Eduardo Madero Avenue address) in 1976, and in 1979, the IBM Tower. These high rises, while not the first in Buenos Aires to incorporate elements of the International Style (such as curtain walls), became the first to do so as a group. SEPRA Arquitectos, a prominent Argentine architectural firm, designed the Sheraton Hotel and the Catalinas Norte Tower.\n\nThe implosion of the dictatorship's economic policies in 1981 led to a suspension in new developments for the area, however, as well as a sharp decline in new construction as a whole. A subsequent economic recovery that followed Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's 1991 Convertibility Plan prompted renewed interest among developers, and from 1995 to 1998, the Consultatio Group developed the Alem and Catalinas Plaza twin towers, and IRSA, Laminar Plaza (all designed by SEPRA). The final addition to the complex during the 1990s was the Bank Boston Tower. The Postmodern high rise, designed by César Pelli, was completed in 2001 and at 137 meters (450 ft), would become the tallest in the district.\n\nThe flurry of new construction also led to the redevelopment of the southern end of MCBA's redevelopment district (located in the San Nicolás ward). The Bouchard Tower and Loma Negra's Fortabat Tower, both designed by SEPRA, were built between 1991 and 1995. The República Building, designed by Pelli for the now defunct Banco República, was completed in 1996 (with Telefónica de Argentina as its chief tenant). The Microsoft Building (by Mario Roberto Álvarez), opened in 2001, and Bouchard Plaza, designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum for the \"La Nación\" news and publishing group, opened in 2004.\n\nThe complex, which by 2004 included 15 buildings totalling over 540,000 m² (5.8 million ft²), was in the news during 2009 and 2010, when Mayor Mauricio Macri obtained the City Legislature's approval to sell the remaining three undeveloped lots. The combined land is zoned to house up to 120,000 m² (1.3 million ft²) of new office space, and the city sanctioned the future construction of high rises of up to 50 stories, and 150 m (492 ft) in height (slightly more than the tallest building currently in Catalinas). The third and last lot was sold on November 18, 2010, to Banco Macro. The other lots had been sold to IRSA and Consultatio earlier in the year, and the combined sales netted 386 million Argentine pesos (us$99 million), or us$6,866 per m² (us$639 per ft²).\n\nProjects approved for these lots during 2011 include the Macro Tower, a headquarters designed by César Pelli; the Consultatio Tower by Beccar Varela & Associates; and the 29-story IRSA headquarters, designed by Miguel Baudizzone and Jorge Lestard. BBVA Banco Francés, the fifth largest bank in Argentina, announced in 2013 that it would relocate its headquarters to the Consultatio Tower upon the building's completion. One last potential zone for future development, a 5,694 m² (613,000 ft²) property alongside the Alas Building, remains in use as a parking lot.\n\nExisting and Approved Commercial Real Estate in Catalinas Plaza\n\n"}

It took its present name and began a coeducational system with the merger in 1971 of two single-sex establishments, The Choate School (founded in 1896 in Wallingford) and Rosemary Hall (founded in 1890 in Wallingford, moved later to Greenwich, Connecticut). At the merger, the Wallingford campus was enlarged with a complex of modernist buildings on its eastern edge to accommodate the students from Rosemary Hall.\n\nThe school has educated generations of the upper-class New England establishment and the American political elite, and it has introduced many programs to diversify the student population, including the introduction of a free education for families whose income is $75,000 or less. Choate is a member of the Eight Schools Association, begun informally in 1973–74 and formalized in 2006, when former Choate headmaster Edward Shanahan was appointed its first president. The member schools are Choate, Andover, Exeter, Deerfield, St. Paul's, Hotchkiss, Lawrenceville, and Northfield Mount Hermon.\n\nChoate is also a member of the Ten Schools Admissions Organization, established in 1966 and comprising Choate, Andover, Exeter, Deerfield, St. Paul's, Hotchkiss, Lawrenceville, Taft, Loomis Chaffee, and The Hill School.\n\nAmong Choate's alumni are President John F. Kennedy, two-time presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson, playwright Edward Albee, novelist John Dos Passos, investor Brett Icahn, businesswoman and daughter of President Donald Trump Ivanka Trump, philanthropist Paul Mellon, screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher, and actors Glenn Close, Michael Douglas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bruce Dern and Paul Giamatti.\n\nThe schools that would eventually become Choate Rosemary Hall were begun by members of two prominent New England families, the Choates and Atwaters.\n\nRosemary Hall was founded in 1890 by Mary Atwater Choate at Rosemary Farm in Wallingford, her girlhood home and the summer residence of Mary and her husband, William Gardner Choate. Mary, an alumna of Miss Porter's School, was the great-granddaughter of Caleb Atwater (1741–1832), a Connecticut merchant magnate who supplied the American forces during the Revolutionary War. In 1775 General George Washington visited the Atwater store in Wallingford en route to assuming command of the Continental Army. On that occasion, Washington took tea with Judge Oliver Stanley at the \"Red House\" (built 1690–1750), now Squire Stanley House on the Choate campus.\n\nIn 1878 Mary Atwater Choate had co-founded a vocational organization for Civil War widows, the New York Exchange for Women's Work, prototype of many such exchanges across the country (it survived until 2003). In 1889 Mary planned a new institution on the same principle of female self-sufficiency and she advertised in \"The New York Times\" for a headmistress to run a school that would train girls in the \"domestic arts.\" The advertisement was answered by Caroline Ruutz-Rees (1865–1954), a 25-year-old Briton teaching in New Jersey.\n\nOn October 3, 1890, the \"New Haven Morning News\" reported: \"The opening of Rosemary Hall took place at Wallingford yesterday ... at the beautiful Rosemary Farms, which have been the property of Mrs. Choate's family for five generations. ... Rev. Edward Everett Hale addressed the school girls in his inimitable way, at once attractive and helpful. 'Never forget,' said he, 'that it is a great art to do what you do well. If you limp, limp well, and if you dance, dance well'.\"\n\nThe eight arriving girls occupied the original school building, \"old Atwater House\" (built 1758), located at the northwest corner of Christian and Elm streets, where new Atwater House now stands. They also had the use of \"Atwater homestead\" (built 1774, now known as Homestead), which stands at the center of the present day campus, on the northeast corner of Christian and Elm streets.\n\nCaroline Ruutz-Rees (pronounced \"R-Treece\"), headmistress of Rosemary Hall until 1938, was a figure of extraordinary personality and influence, a militant feminist and suffragist of national prominence. On the Wallingford golf course she wore bloomers, which shocked the locals, and on buggy rides to Wallingford station she carried a pistol. She quickly changed Rosemary Hall's mission from \"domestic arts\" to that of a contemporary boys school.\n\nThe Choate School was founded by William and Mary Choate in 1896. William Gardner Choate (1830–1921), Harvard class of 1852, was U.S. District Judge for the Southern Circuit of New York from 1878 to 1881, and afterward a partner of Shipman, Barlow, Laroque, and Choate. He was a national authority on admiralty, railroad, bankruptcy, and corporation law. Like his younger, more famous brother, he was a prominent clubman (Harvard and The Century). That brother was Joseph Hodges Choate, lawyer, prosecutor of the Tweed Ring, and Ambassador to the Court of St. James's.\n\nWilliam and Mary Choate invited Mark Pitman (1830–1905), their tenant in the aforementioned Red House, to start a boys' school under their sponsorship. Pitman, Bowdoin class of 1859, was 66 years old, a widower, and had been principal of Woolsey School in New Haven, Connecticut, since 1872. He accepted the Choates' offer, not least perhaps because it would provide employment for his unmarried adult daughters, Leila, Elizabeth, and Helen. Six boys entered the new school in fall term 1896, their average age about ten. Four of the six lived in Red House with the Pitmans, and Red House (now Squire Stanley House) has remained a dormitory to the present day.\n\nPitman taught Latin, English, history, and science; Elizabeth taught art, Helen piano, and Leila was writing teacher and school nurse. Mary Choate's physician brother, Huntington Atwater, taught crafts and was school doctor. There was no formal relationship with the Choates' other foundation, Rosemary Hall, a hundred yards to the east on Christian Street, but there were coeducational audiences for plays and recitals and Mary Choate hosted dances at the Homestead.\n\nIn 1897 the boys school erected Choate House across the street from Red House, the first purpose-built institutional building (and John F. Kennedy's dormitory in 1931-2). It contained recitation rooms, an infirmary, a dining room, and housing for fifteen boys. In 1899 Choate House was venue for the first \"Junior Dance\", but a year later the Rosemary girls would depart for a seventy-one year absence.\n\nThe official history of Choate Rosemary Hall, written by Tom Generous, says that the rift between Caroline Ruutz-Rees and Mary Choate, proponents of two very different sorts of feminism, was public knowledge as early as 1896. In that year the two women did not share the lectern at Prize Day, and local newspapers published \"denials\" of a rumor that Ruutz-Rees would leave the school. But by 1900 the headmistress and her educational style had acquired influential champions among the students' parents and two of them, residents of Greenwich, Connecticut, joined forces to effect the removal of the school to their town.\n\nShipping magnate Nathaniel Witherell donated of land in the Rock Ridge section of Greenwich. Julian Curtiss gathered a group of investors and established a joint stock corporation funded through the sale of six-percent bonds. Ruutz-Rees was the chief shareholder. The Greenwich residence of Rosemary Hall began in fall term 1900, when 57 girl students moved into the Main Building, known as \"The School\", a U-shaped shingled house on Zaccheus Mead Lane.\n\nIn Wallingford, Mark Pitman died on December 3, 1905. Until 1908 Sumner Blakemore was titular headmaster, but the school was effectively the domain of the three Pitman sisters. At the 1908 graduation ceremony the Japanese Consul General watched his countryman Noyobu Masuda give the valedictory address. Then Judge Choate introduced the man who would assume the headmastership in the fall, George St. John, and his wife, Clara Seymour St. John. She was a Bryn Mawr alumna, member of a well-connected Connecticut family, sister of future (1937–1951) Yale president Charles Seymour, and descendant of Yale president (1740–1766) Thomas Clap.\n\nGeorge Clair St. John (1877–1966), Harvard class of 1902, aged 31 in the fall of 1908, had grown up on a farm in Hoskins Station, Connecticut. He was an ordained Episcopal priest. He had taught at The Hill School in Pennsylvania and Adirondack-Florida School, and was teaching at Hackley School in Tarrytown, N.Y., when Samuel Dutton of Columbia Teachers College recruited him for the headmastership. St. John \"knew, long before I read Mr. Dutton's letter, that I wanted some day to have a school of my own. In my thought about it, Dean Briggs was my first text.\" This was LeBaron Russell Briggs, dean of men at Harvard when St. John was there and afterward dean of the faculty until 1925. Briggs, St. John wrote, \"fathered the whole college\", and the St. Johns too would serve \"in loco parentis\".\n\nTheir first move to secure parental powers was decisive. In September 1909, as the official history tells it, the St. Johns \"signed with the Choates an 'Agreement to Lease and Purchase.' Under its terms, the younger couple rented the school, its property and reputation, for five years at a sum equal to 11 percent of The Choate School's net income per year. ... Less than twenty months later, on May 12, 1911, St. John reported to the trustees that he had purchased the title to the school by acquiring mortgages of roughly $41,000. He resold the title in turn to The Choate School, Incorporated, for $23,000 cash and $38,000 in stock ... For all intents and purposes, The Choate School belonged to George St. John.\"\n\nIn his first quarter-century as headmaster, St. John created much of Choate as it is regarded today. Of the Georgian brick and stone campus, he had built by 1932 Hill House, West Wing, the Gymnasium, Memorial House, the Chapel, the Library, the Winter Exercise Building, and Archbold Infirmary, which was the largest school infirmary in the country. He grew the enrollment from 35 to 505 boys and the faculty from 5 to 64 masters. In the decade following the First World War (classes of 1918 to 1928) Choate sent 412 of its 618 graduates to Yale, Princeton, and Harvard, according to a table published in \"The Choate News\" in fall term 1928.\n\nGeorge St. John belonged to the generation of legendary, long-serving headmasters who shaped the New England prep school, chief among whom were Endicott Peabody of Groton, Frank Boyden of Deerfield, Horace Dutton Taft of Taft, Frederick Sill of Kent, Samuel Drury of St. Paul's, Alfred Stearns of Andover, Lewis Perry of Exeter, and George Van Santvoord of Hotchkiss.\n\nThe Rev. George St. John of Choate was succeeded in 1947 by his son, the Rev. Seymour St. John '31 (1912–2006), and the \"St. John dynasty\" was continued to 1973. Seymour was Yale class of 1935 and was ordained after graduating from Virginia Theological Seminary in 1942. During his time as head he built as many buildings as his father had built, greatly broadened the curriculum, raised the national profile of the school, and made it more progressive (Eleanor Roosevelt, Norman Thomas, and William Sloane Coffin were regular speakers) and cosmopolitan (Russian, Near Eastern, and Afro-American studies centers were founded, and Russian, Chinese, and Arabic courses were begun). St. John was a longtime advocate of coeducation and initiated the Choate-Rosemary contacts. At his death, headmaster Edward Shanahan told the \"New York Times\", \"The merger demanded an enormous expenditure of resources by Choate because the building of a new campus was to occur within the footprints of its property. Seymour was central to the decision to expand those resources.\"\n\nIn 1931 John F. Kennedy entered Choate as a third form (9th grade) student, following his older brother Joe Jr, who was a star athlete at the school. Jack Kennedy—sickly, underweight, and nicknamed Rat Face by his schoolfellows—spent his first two years at Choate in his brother's shadow, and compensated for it with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie. He named his group The Muckers Club, which had thirteen members—Kennedy and twelve disciples. (Among these was Kennedy's lifelong inseparable friend Kirk LeMoyne \"Lem\" Billings, who kept an apartment in the White House during JFK's presidency.)\n\nAs Headmaster of Choate, George St. John's chapel talks included a recurring phrase that was widely remembered by Choate alumni. In 2008, school archivist Judy Donald found the phrase in St. John's notebooks, and in 2011 journalist Chris Matthews published the discovery in his biography of JFK. St. John's phrase (borrowed from Harvard dean LeBaron Briggs) was, \"The youth who loves his alma mater will always ask not 'What can she do for me?' but 'What can I do for her?'\" Speculation that this was the original of JFK's inaugural address \"Ask not\" goes back at least as far as a 1966 \"Time\" magazine article, and several of JFK's Choate contemporaries noticed the echo in 1961. Kennedy graduated from Choate in 1935. In senior class polling for the yearbook (of which he was business manager), Kennedy was voted Most Likely to Succeed.\n\n\nIn 2017, it acknowledged a decades-long sex abuse scandal, with multiple victims being subjected to abuse from faculty members.\n\nChoate's curriculum includes elective and interdisciplinary courses, from astronomy and architecture to printmaking and post-modernism to digital video and development economics. There are more than 300 courses in the curriculum, which has requirements in community service and in contemporary global studies. All disciplines have honors courses. As of 2017, Choate no longer offers AP (Advanced Placement) courses.\n\nA two-year intensive Science Research Program includes mentored laboratory work during the summer at universities in the United States and abroad. The Capstone Program allows sixth form (senior) students to explore an area of the curriculum in depth. Working under a faculty adviser, students take at least five courses that focus on a curricular theme, culminating in a substantial final project. During the college application process, Choate's College Counseling Office highlights Capstone Project participation in letters of recommendation.\n\nThe performing and visual arts are supported by the resources of the Paul Mellon Arts Center. Among extracurricular arts clubs are five \"a cappella\" groups; step dance, slam poetry, hip hop, and rap groups; improv, musical theater, and instrumental ensembles of all sizes; photography and film-making clubs; and supporting publications for the arts, fashion, and culture. The Arts Concentration Program provides students with individually tailored instruction and class scheduling.\n\nThe Senior Project Program provides on- or off-campus internships in academic research, visual art, and the performing arts. Other specialized programs include American Studies, creative writing, economics, FBLA, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, religion, debate, and the Fed Challenge. The 2011–12 academic year saw the introduction of an Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies Program (AMES). Choate's Office of Global Studies supports study-abroad and other international initiatives. One-third of Choate students participate in programs in China, France, Japan, Spain, and Jordan.\n\nThe Kohler Environmental Center, designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, opened in 2012 and is located on a 268-acre site in the northeast quadrant of the campus. It has been described as \"the first teaching, research and residential environmental center in U.S. secondary education.\" It can house up to 20 students and two faculty members and supports the curricular Environmental Immersion Program.\n\nIn February 2015 the school opened the Lanphier Center for Mathematics and Computer Science, a $17 million, 35,000-square foot campus hub for information technology, applied mathematics, and robotics. The center, designed by architect César Pelli's firm Pelli Clarke Pelli, contains laboratories, classrooms, a lecture hall, and common spaces. It composes a U-shaped courtyard centering on a giant weeping beech tree, and is linked by a footbridge spanning Science Center Pond to the Icahn Center for Science.\n\nChoate's Fed Challenge team was the 2009 national champion and has won the New England District Championship in 12 of the past 13 years. In the 2012 American Mathematics Competitions (AMC 12), Choate's team finished first in the nation, with the highest combined score of all 2600 participating schools.\n\nThe Choate chamber orchestra performed at the White House in December 2009 and the school's symphony orchestra toured Europe in 2010 and 2011, giving concerts in ten countries. The festival and chamber choruses performed at St. Patrick's Day mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome in 2011. The Maiyeros, an \"a cappella\" group, performed at Westminster Abbey in 2008. Choate orchestras and choral groups toured East Asia in 2000, 2005, 2007, and 2014. The June 2014 tour comprised concerts in Seoul, Hong Kong, and Macau, at the Great Wall at Ju Yong Guan, and in ensemble with the Concert Band of Beijing Children's Palace. Choate orchestras have also performed at Lincoln Center in New York, Carnegie Hall, and the Guggenheim Museum. The school's student-operated radio station, WWEB, is FCC-licensed and has been broadcasting since 1969.\n\nIn 2012 Choate became the first among its peer preparatory schools to require that all faculty and students own an iPad. The fall term that year saw the beginning of full integration of the tablet's capabilities into the syllabus. Choate's director of academic technology discussed Choate's iPad program in an August 2012 article in \"US News\".\n\nChoate enrolls 650 boarding and 215 day students representing 43 states and 44 countries. 15 percent of students are international and 33 percent identify themselves as persons of color. For the 2012–2013 year there were 2,018 applicants of whom 19 percent were accepted. The Choate admissions office hosted or sponsored events in 29 states and 14 countries. The 2014–2015 tuition and fees are $54,840 for boarders and $42,840 for day students.\n\nFinancial aid totaling more than $10 million was awarded to 32 percent of the student body, the average award being $38,000 for boarders and $26,000 for day students. A variety of named scholarship endowments support students of various profiles, including the Paul Mellon scholarships (science and math), the Gakio-Walton (Africa, the Middle East, India), the Glendorn (southwestern U.S. states), the Wallingford (local residence), and many others.\n\nThe teaching faculty numbers 131 of whom 67 percent hold advanced degrees. Approximately 90 percent of teaching faculty live on campus. In addition, there are 51 administrative faculty members. The average class size is 12 and student-faculty ratio is 6:1.\n\nIn the fiscal year ending June 2014 Choate's endowment was $356.7 million. Among member institutions of the Eight Schools Association Choate led in gifts from parents, with $2.1 million. Total gifts received in that fiscal year were $28.9 million. In November 2006 the school inaugurated a capital campaign with a target of $200 million and by the campaign's close in 2011 gifts and pledges of $220 million had been secured.\n\nProtestant, Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim chaplains serve Choate's campus ministry. Services include Christian fellowship, Protestant evening services, Roman Catholic Mass, Buddhist meditation, Hillel, Spiritual Alternatives, Reflections Program, and other student worship groups.\n\nThe school fields 81 interscholastic athletic teams in 32 sports. Choate's historical archrival in athletic competition is Deerfield Academy. The final weekend of the fall season is Deerfield Day (at Deerfield it's called Choate Day), when the two schools compete in every sport.\n\nOn July 1, 2011, Dr. Alex Curtis succeeded Edward Shanahan as headmaster of Choate. Shanahan had served as head for twenty years from 1991, when he arrived from Dartmouth College. Curtis was selected by unanimous vote of the Choate board on November 4, 2010. Before Choate, Curtis was headmaster of Morristown-Beard School in New Jersey for seven years.\n\nThe campus contains 121 buildings in a variety of architectural styles. Georgian Revival predominates (examples by famed traditionalist architect Ralph Adams Cram and by Polhemus & Coffin), but there are also eighteenth- and nineteenth-century houses and dramatic modernist structures (examples by I.M. Pei and by James Polshek).\n\nPrincipal buildings are in Georgian red brick, often with classical porticoes that were, by design, the unifying architectural feature of the early building phase. Of this type are, in chronological order:\n\nThe I. M. Pei-designed buildings on campus are:\n\nOther large-scale buildings and athletic facilities include:\n\nChoate competes in sports against schools from all over New England and adjacent states. Teams are fielded at the levels of varsity, junior varsity, and thirds sections. There are 32 different sports and 81 teams in interscholastic competition. Intramural programs include aerobics, dance, senior weight training, yoga, winter running, rock climbing, fitness and conditioning, and senior volleyball.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2016 Choate has won New England championships in football, boys' and girls' ice hockey, girls' soccer, boys' golf, boys' crew, and in girls' swimming, volleyball, and water polo. In that same period, Choate has won Founders League championships in boys' and girls' squash, in boys' cross country, golf, softball, and tennis, and in girls' volleyball.\n\nThe athletic directors of Choate and the other members of the Eight Schools Association compose the Eight Schools Athletic Council, which organizes sports events and tournaments among ESA schools. Choate is also a member of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) and the Founders League, which comprises private schools located mainly in Connecticut.\n\nChoate Rosemary Hall and Deerfield Academy have had a long-standing rivalry. The final weekend of the fall sports season is Deerfield Day (at Deerfield it's called \"Choate Day\"), when the two schools compete in every sport at varsity and sub-varsity levels. The tradition began in 1922 with an exchange of letters between Deerfield head Frank Boyden and Choate head George St. John. Since then, busloads (in the early years, trainloads) of students have made the 80-mile journey along the Connecticut River valley to cheer their teams on the rival's campus.\n\nIn the days leading up to the event, rallies and activities are held, led by Choate's Boar Pen cheering section and Deerfield's Captain Deerfield. At Choate there's the igniting of a fire-breathing dragon of sophisticated construction. At Deerfield there's a bonfire topped by a burning C, and ritual encircling of the school seal so that Choate teams won't tread on it. In recent years, alumni clubs of the two schools have met at venues around the world, from London to Los Angeles, to watch live-streaming of the varsity football game.\n\nSimilar boarding school traditions include the Andover–Exeter rivalry and Hotchkiss–Taft rivalry.\n\nThe cricket match that Rosemary Hall hosted in Wallingford in 1893 against Mrs. Hazen's School of Pelham Manor, N.Y., has been described as \"the first interscholastic girls sporting event in American history.\" (Girls \"intramural\" sports had, of course, existed, but the Rosemary cricket match is the earliest discoverable \"extramural\" item.) The dating to 1893 occurs in the official history of Choate, published in 1997. Other discussions of the event give an inferential date of 1895 or earlier, referencing newspaper articles in 1896 that imply a well-established rivalry. An 1898 wire story titled \"Women and Cricket\" said that the Rosemary–Hazen series was four years old. Whatever the date of the first match, journalistic treatment of the novelty was \"over-publicized and mildly sensationalized\", according to a standard history of American cricket published in 1998. \"Bareheaded and wearing sweaters and short skirts\", reported \"The New York Times\", \"daughters of some of the most prominent men in the country defied the cold, wintry wind.\" The \"Baltimore Morning Herald\" under the headline \"Girls Play Cricket\" noted that \"the Pelham girls' skirts were some two or three inches longer than those of their opponents.\" In November 1896 the \"Yale Medical Journal\" carried a notice that Yale Med student Frederick Hulseberg had been \"engaged to coach the Rosemary Hall cricket team this fall\", thereby becoming the first coach of women's cricket in America.\n\nDuring World War II, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, under orders from the Office of Defense Transportation, told major league team owners to find spring training venues close to home. In Boston, the Red Sox chose Tufts University and the Braves at first considered Phillips Academy (Andover). But a sports editor at \"The Boston Globe\" was a Choate alumnus, and he persuaded the Braves to look at Choate's Winter Exercise Building (now the Johnson Athletic Center), one of the largest glass-roofed, cage-netted rooms in the country, and easily able to accommodate a baseball infield. The Braves moved into Choate dormitories on March 21, 1943 and again in March 1944.\n\nTheir roster included Warren Spahn, Johnny Sain (\"Spahn and Sain and pray for rain\"), and manager Casey Stengel. The journalistic opportunity afforded by Stengel in a prep school setting was not lost, and a famous wire-service photo shows him dressed in mortarboard and gown \"lecturing\" his players. His nickname \"The Perfessor\" first appears at this time, as does a fine example of Stengelese: asked to comment on Choate's facilities, he said, \"Excellent workouts in that there cage you just saw, which is a honey in all my years to the present time, if I may be permitted to drop into the vernacular.\"\n\nChoate Rosemary Hall's traditional events include:\n\n\nIn 1935 Gertrude Stein gave a series of talks in the United States that included, on January 12 and 13, a visit to Choate. Fortunately for literary posterity, her audience included both a stenographer and Dudley Fitts, critic, translator, and longtime teacher of Greek and Latin at Choate. Stein's public speaking style was extemporary, and Fitts recognized the permanent value of a stenographic transcript. After an exchange of letters, Stein authorized Fitts to oversee publication of her talk in \"The Choate Literary Magazine\". On February 5, he sent her the page proofs, saying, \"I had to restore a great deal of the lecture from memory. I hope I didn't spoil anything. Sorry to have missed entirely what you said about the noun.\" (Fitts's typescript and the Fitts-Stein correspondence are now at Yale.)\n\nStein's essay appeared in the February 1935 issue of \"The Lit\" with the title \"How Writing Is Written.\" It has many times since been anthologized and given academic treatment, with the Choate text unaltered. It \"occupies a unique place in Stein's corpus as a social text that carries the marks of its particular occasion ... direct address to her audience (around sixty boys, as well as faculty and some former students).\" Stein's two-day stay at Choate was her first exposure to a private school, if we can believe her statement in \"Everybody's Autobiography\" (published 1937). She wrote, \"It was the first time I had ever seen such a school. When I was brought up in East Oakland we all went to public school ... The boys from twelve to sixteen listened really listened [\"sic\"] to everything I had to say ... I had been much struck by the Choate school literary magazine which did have extraordinary good writing in it.\"\n\nIn 1944 Edward Albee transferred from Valley Forge Military Academy to Choate, with admissions director Frank Wheeler making a prescient note, \"I have a feeling he will distinguish himself in literature.\" His brilliance was quickly recognized and mentored by such teachers as John Joseph, Charles Rice, and Sandy Lehmann. He was made managing editor of \"The Lit\" and for two years a large part of its content, in all genres, was supplied by him. Incidents from Albee's time at Choate are reworked for his plays, including the famous \"bergin and water\" speech in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" and the \"walking crow\" speech in \"Tiny Alice\", which reproduces almost verbatim English teacher Lehmann's criticism of a sonnet Albee wrote for \"The Lit\". The May 1946 Commencement issue of \"The Lit\" contained Albee's first published play, a long one-acter called \"Schism\". Another play written at Choate, \"Each In His Own Way\", went unpublished and forgotten until 1996, when a classmate preparing for their 50th reunion found it in a scrapbook.\n\n\n"}

Hashemi was named by Robert Dreyfuss as a CIA and Mossad agent; Hashemi sued Dreyfuss and Lyndon LaRouche, whose \"Executive Intelligence Review\" had linked Hashemi to funding of Iranian terrorism, with the case dismissed in June 1983 due to Hashemi's failure to respond to legal documents. Hashemi died in 1986 in London in mysterious circumstances; the official cause of death was \"a rare and virulent form of leukemia that was diagnosed only two days before Hashemi died.\"\n\nHashemi and his brother Jamshid Hashemi were persecuted by the Shah's SAVAK during the 1963 White Revolution, and left Iran as a result. The Hashemis had connections with Ahmed Madani, who was exiled in 1970 and went on to become Defense Minister after the 1979 Revolution.\n\nThe Hashemis supported the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and Jamshid was appointed to oversee the national radio network, where he worked with Mehdi Karroubi's brother Hassan. Hashemi said he was a cousin to Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, an aide of the Ayatollah Khomeini who was elected Speaker of the Iranian Parliament in 1980.\n\nFrom November 1980 to January 1981 wiretaps were placed in the New York offices of the First Gulf Bank and Trust Company, of which Hashemi was the head. The bank had handled clandestine money transfers for the Iranian government, with Admiral Ahmad Madani, then the Defense Minister, ordering $30–$35m transferred to an account there in late 1979.\n\nA 1992 Senate investigation concluded that Hashemi was involved in a 1980 CIA attempt to funnel $500,000 to the campaign of Iranian presidential candidate Ahmad Madani, ahead of the Iranian presidential election, 1980. Charles Cogan met with Hashemi and his brother Jamshid in New York on 5 January, and in the context of the Iran hostage crisis the Hashemis \"promised to put U.S. officials in touch with top officials in the Tehran government, including a family member of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\", but asked for financial support for Madani. The CIA provided $500,000 in cash on 17 January, which was rejected in favour of a wire transfer via Switzerland. Hashemi later returned $290,000 to Cogan, via the office of John Stanley Pottinger, after Cogan had determined that less than $100,000 had been spent for its intended purpose. Madani later testified to the House October Surprise Task Force that he had told off Hashemi for attempting to collaborate with the Republicans behind Carter's back; he said Hashemi had offered to bring Casey to a meeting to discuss a hostage deal.\n\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\", by the mid-1980s Hashemi, although maintaining an appearance of wealth (such as commuting to his London office in a gold-trimmed Rolls-Royce) was facing bankruptcy, in part due to major gambling losses sustained in London casinos.\n\nIn mid-1985 Hashemi was partnered with Adnan Khashoggi in \"World Trade Group\", \"a joint venture ... that was seeking to trade farm equipment, oil and military weapons with Iran.\" Roy Furmark was also involved.\n\nIn June 1985 Hashemi approached William Casey with a new arms-for-hostages plan. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported in 1988 that \"according to newly declassified CIA and State Department memos, Hashemi approached then-CIA Director William J. Casey with an arms-for-hostages plan of his own that was strikingly similar to the one that would soon be embraced by the White House as its secret Iran arms initiative.\" According to one source, Hashemi's lawyer in this proposal was John Stanley Pottinger. A June 1985 CIA memo documented a call regarding a potential arms-for-hostages deal from Hashemi to Shaheen. The \"Times\" said in 1988 it had discovered that Hashemi was meeting with Adnan Khashoggi and Manucher Ghorbanifar, and that Hashemi's efforts to arrange a deal collapsed in August 1985 due to Kashoggi's competing efforts to arrange US access to Ghorbanifar via Robert McFarlane.\n\nIn 1986 Hashemi acted as a government informant in a four-month sting operation for the US Customs Service, resulting in the Brokers of Death arms case, which the \"Los Angeles Times\" described in 1988 as \"the largest arms conspiracy prosecution ever brought by the Justice Department\". Hashemi had agreed to act as an informant in exchange for the dropping of arms smuggling charges against him.\n"}
{"id": "42555412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42555412", "title": "Daniel Lang (writer)", "text": "Daniel Lang (writer)\n\nDaniel Lang (May 30, 1913 – November 17, 1981) was an American author and journalist. He worked as a staff writer for The New Yorker Magazine from 1941 until his death in 1981.\n\nDaniel Lang was born on the Lower East Side of New York City to Fanny and Noosan Lang, Hungarian Jewish immigrants. He was raised by his mother and half-sister, Bella Cohen. These early years are described in a semi-autobiographical short story, \"The Robbers,\" by Daniel, and in \"Streets, A Memoir of the Lower East Side,\" written by Bella.\n\nBy the time Lang reached high school age, he and his mother had moved to Brooklyn, where he attended Erasmus Hall High School, graduating in 1929. Following high school, he worked for several years, then entered the University of Wisconsin on scholarship, receiving his BA in 1936.\n\nAfter graduation, Lang worked as a government Works Progress Administration sociologist in the South. His life ambition was to write, however, and he soon found a job at The New York Post. During this time he met Margaret Altschul, a reporter for the New York Journal-American, whom he married in 1942. They were married for 39 years, living and raising their three daughters in New York City.\n\nRecalling Lang's appearance at the New Yorker, former New Yorker editor William Shawn wrote, \"He arrived in our offices one day in 1941, shortly before the United States entered the Second World War, with an impressive sheaf of clippings of articles he had written for the New York Post. He was immediately taken onto the staff and soon wrote his first Reporter-at-Large piece on the British American Ambulance Corps.\n\nLang served as war correspondent for the New Yorker in Italy, France and North Africa. Following the war, he observed and reported on atomic testing. Problems raised by nuclear testing concerning the moral responsibility of scientists remained a keen interest and the topic of many articles over the years. During the Vietnam War era, he became absorbed by the ethical choices raised by this conflict and was one of the first reporters to expose military atrocities against the Vietnamese civilian population. Toward the end of his writing career, he interviewed aging Germans, former Flakhelfer, about their role in the Third Reich, returning to his focus on how individuals can become implicated in evil through denial and the refusal to acknowledge reality.\n\nMany of his New Yorker articles were collected and published in book form and translated into various languages including Spanish, Dutch, German, Polish and Japanese.\n\nWilliam Shawn described Lang's work in this way: \"He was one of the most steadfast and talented of our reportorial writers. His writings invariably had moral weight. He was a student of the conscience. Implicit in every piece he wrote was a controlling idea, but he never lapsed into abstraction. He tried very hard to understand the people he wrote about, and far more often than not he succeeded.”\n\nAnd in the words of author John Hersey, “In all his years of writing, Dan never touched...a trivial subject. In his person he was extraordinarily modest, as writers go, but the reach of his mind as an author could not have been more ambitious. As he grew from piece to piece, he stubbornly and courageously manifested that his job as a writer in the atomic age was nothing less than to address the moral consciousness of humankind... But the tone of his work was never inflated or too grand, as such subjects and themes might have threatened to make it. The power of his voice came paradoxically from its quietness. He approached our minds and hearts very simply, in a storyteller's way, through tales about people faced with the great dilemmas of our time.” \n\nIn addition to journalism, Lang wrote poetry, children’s literature, short stories and an opera libretto.\n\nHis New Yorker article, \"The Bank Drama,\" reported on a hostage situation in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1973, from which psychiatrist Nils Bejerot coined the phrase \"Stockholm Syndrome.\"\n\nHe was married to Margaret Altschul, daughter of banker Frank Altschul and sister of Arthur Altschul. They had three daughters: Frances Lang-Labaree, Helen Lang, and Cecily Lang-Kooyman.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He and twenty-one other executives were accused of defrauding 37,000 investors of at least 126 billion yen (approximately US$1.4 billion) between 2001 and 2009. Nami is the inventor of a quasi-currency, \"Enten\", which he used to attract investors. Some sources put the total amount of the money involved as high as 226 billion yen, which would make it, if proven, to be the biggest investment fraud in Japanese history since Toyota Shoji, an investment group, defrauded investors of 202.5 billion yen in the late '80s.\n\nIn order to gain credibility and popularity, Nami's company used famous enka singers such as Takashi Hosokawa in their advertisements. In May 2008, Hosokawa was accused on the Japanese civil court for participating, but he insisted that he was not responsible for the content of their advertisement.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, set up in 1987, originally sold futons and health food, and began accepting investment money in 2001. The company's established existence tricked many into believing it was stable. A 65-year-old woman who lost 30 million yen (about US$300,000) saved over four decades was quoted as saying: \"I thought the company was fine as it was in business for a long time\". Another woman, a 70-year-old who blamed herself for the loss of two million yen (about US$20,000), said: \"I had fun and a lively life ... I was stupid. It's my fault as I was greedy.\"\n\nSince 2004 Nami had been issuing special electronic money which he referred to as to investors who paid at least ¥100,000 (approx. £750, US$1,100). Enten was a virtual currency which Nami expected to become legal tender in the post-recession by which time he will also have become \"world famous.\" Investors were promised 36% annual returns. There was even an \"Enten fair\" during which participants sang the praises of Nami's investment plan. One woman described the existence of Enten as \"wonderful\", whilst another said: \"It's like a dream, I can buy anything.\"\n\n\"Enten\" were generated through his customers' mobile phones and could be used to purchase items online, including vegetables, futons, clothing and jewelry. In February 2007, L&G dividends were distributed in Enten, rather than in cash, which caused many lawsuits and cancellations of accounts. In October 2007, police searched L&G's headquarters in Tokyo, suspecting that the company had violated investment laws. The company declared bankruptcy in November 2007. \n\nNami denies allegations of any wrongdoing. He had built up a cult-like following amongst his investors. Lawyers representing these victims say Nami believed he had a \"divine decree\" to \"eliminate poverty from this world.\"\n\nNami was drinking beer when police, followed by reporters, arrested him in a restaurant where he was eating his breakfast close to his Tokyo office at 5:30 a.m. local time on 4 February 2009. Nami and other company executives were arrested on suspicion of violating the Law for Punishment of Organized Crimes. Nami declared his innocence as he was led away by the police, accusing them of destroying his business. Arrested before television cameras, Nami insisted: \"Time will tell if I'm a conman or a swindler. I'm leading 50,000 people. Can they charge a company this big with fraud?\" Shortly beforehand, he had been asked about his feelings for those who had lost money: \"No. I have put my life at stake. Why do I have to apologize? I'm the poorest victim. Nobody lost more than I did. You should be aware that high returns come with a high risk.\"\n\nOn March 18, 2010, Nami was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his scheme. \n\n"}

Unusual for the time, his wife Nelda played an active role in the creation and development of the family's lumber business which led the couple to the small community of Harvey, New Brunswick, where they made their permanent home in the 1930s. Highly successful, Corey's lumber operations grew to employ more than five hundred people.\n\nIntroduced to politics by his father-in-law, in the 1944 New Brunswick general election, Corey was elected to the 40th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly as the Liberal Party's candidate for York County.

{"id": "32101249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32101249", "title": "International trade and state security", "text": "International trade and state security\n\nInternational economic structures range from complete autarky to complete market openness. This structure has undergone numerous changes since the beginning of the nineteenth century. The state-power theory as put into perspective by Stephen Krasner (1976), explains that the structure of international trade is determined by the interests and power of states acting to maximize their aggregate national income, social stability, political power and economic growth. Such state interests can be achieved under free trade.\n\nThe relationship between these interests and the level of openness depends upon the economic power of states. Power is dependent upon a states size and level of economic development.\n\nKrasner contends that distributions of potential power may vary from multipolar to hegemonic; and different international trading structures are made of either of these. The key to this argument is that a hegemonic distribution of potential economic power is likely to result in an open trading system. Since states act to maximize their aggregate economic utility, maximum global welfare is achieved under free trade.\n\nNeoclassical trade theory posits that the greater the degree of openness in the international trading system, the greater the level of aggregate economic income.\n\nRobert Gilpin and Stephen Krasner are advocates of the realist tradition, which emphasises the hegemonic system. The hegemonic system contends that there are states that are much larger and more developed than their trading partners and therefore, the costs and benefits of openness are not symmetrical for all members of the system. Krasner (1976) contends that the hegemonic state will have a preference for an open structure because it will increase its aggregate national income and power.\n\nRealism emphasizes states' demands for power and security. Military force is therefore, the most important power resource. States must rely ultimately on their own resources and must strive to maintain their power positions in the system, even at high economic costs. For realism, the most important variables are the economic and military strength of hegemonic states; and international hostilities are mainly because of variations in the distribution of political-military capabilities between states.\n\nThe theory of hegemonic stability by the realist school argues that dominance of one country is necessary for the existence of an open and stable international economy. The relationship between hegemony and an open, stable economy has been challenged by some scholars “As US behaviour during the interwar period illustrates, the possession of superior resources by a nation does not translate automatically into great influence or beneficial outcomes for the world.” \n\nRealist trade encourages Import substitution industrialization (ISI) replacing imports with domestic production. Realism recognises that trade regulations can be used to correct domestic distortions and to promote new industries.\n\nUnder realism, states possess a high degree of discretionary power to influence many variables and prices in the economy. The government influences the distribution of investment, thus protecting national industries.\n\nRealists with their focus on power and the struggle for survival in an anarchical world, criticize the role of international institutions that govern the world economy, such as the World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO), EU, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Scholars argue that the influence exerted by international institutions is dependent upon the states that form part of them, and therefore international institutions have little independent impact. Accordingly, the realist school emphasises the impact of state power over the strength of the institution per se.\n\nThe liberal tradition consists of two schools of thought on the causes of peace, one emphasises representative government and international institutions and the other advocates global markets and economic development.\n\nLiberalism traces back to Immanuel Kant. Kantian Liberalism posits that democracy, economic interdependence and international organisations are optimal solutions for reducing the incidence of conflict. It is not individual factors, which lead to a more peaceful world, but rather all three elements working in conjunction, which eliminates conflict.\n\nOneal and Russett’s (2001) research design has become a standard choice of replications in studies assessing the Kantian peace triangle where democracies tend to be interdependent and members of the same International Government Organisations (IGOs). Their research is consistent with the argument that democratic peace advocates economic interdependence and a joint need to attain membership in IGOs in order to prevent the incidence of conflict. However, the empirical findings on the Kantian peace triangle as a joint force to eliminate conflict presents some limitations, as one study found that the three Kantian peace variables are less robust in explaining leaders’ conflict behaviour. Keohane and Nye (2000) go further to include the lack of additional components in this theory including environmental and military measurements.\n\nLiberals emphasise two main aspects of the benefits of trade. First, trade promotes states to work together and cooperatively, reinforcing peaceful relations among trading partners. The second benefit is based on the expected utility model of trade and conflict which emphasises the potential economic consequences of a disruption in trade. Countries are therefore deterred from initiating conflict against a trading partner for fear of losing the welfare gains associated with trade.\n\nLiberals argue that economic interdependence between states reduces conflict because conflict discourages commerce.\n\nRecent cost-benefit calculations of trade take into account information as an important component in the explanation of the pacifying aspect of economic interdependence. Through open trade, states reveal their intentions and capabilities and thus “relations become more transparent and reduce uncertainty.”\n\nFurthermore, economic interdependence makes costly signals possible. If military action did not entail loss, national leaders would not be able to communicate their capabilities and resolve. This acts as a deterrent and promotes peace between states. “Mechanisms that facilitate the transmission of credible information across international boundaries limit bargaining failure, enhancing interstate peace.” \n\nThere is some disagreement about the interdependence liberal thesis among some scholars. Kenneth Waltz, for example, argues that since \"close interdependence means closeness of contact and raises the prospect of at least occasional conflict . . . the [liberal] myth of interdependence . . . asserts a false belief about the conditions that may promote peace.\" \n\nDespite the scrutiny, there is a long-held position that economic interdependence has a pacifying effect on interstate relations, evidenced by research conducted by Oneal & Russett 1999 and Xiang et al. 2007.\n\nAccording to the liberal view, the costly nature of conflict is central to contemporary bargaining theory.\n\nKeohane & Nye (1987) put forth four conditions that make the use of force by large states costly:\n\n\nLiberal trade encourages export led growth (ELG), leaving traders and consumers dependent on foreign markets. Liberals argue that these actors have an incentive to avoid hostilities with their trading partners, since any disruption in commercial relations would be costly.\n\nInternational institutions are a key feature of the liberal peace, because they represent credible signals of resolve to defend member states in times of crisis, regulate state behaviour, facilitate communication and create common security interests between member states.\n\nThe relationship between international trade and conflict has been a source of controversy among international relations scholars. Some scholars argue that trade does not reduce conflict even though conflict reduces trade; while others report that international trade fosters a peaceful disposition among states, which are less likely to resort to armed conflict in times of crisis.\n\nThe argument that open trade inhibits conflict dates back to the classical liberal movement of free trade and world peace. This view argues that increasing interaction among traders and consumers (interdependence) promotes peace; free trade fosters a sense of international community that reduce interstate conflict and tensions. Liberals posit that free markets and economic development contribute to a reduction in interstate conflict. The contrasting contemporary view is that open trade dampens political conflict by promoting economic dependence.\n\nEconomic dependence has negative consequences for interstate conflict. Albert O. Hirschman (1945) for example, has pointed out that the “gains from trade do not accrue to states proportionately and the distribution of these gains can affect interstate power relations. Moreover, shifts in power relations are widely regarded as a potent source of military conflict.”\n\nEconomic interdependence and greater openness exposes domestic economies to the exigencies of the world market. Social instability is therefore increased by exposure to international competition. This negative force undermines the Kantian peace and remains a cause for concern in international conflict. Although this concern seems legitimate given the economic disparities between developed and developing countries, studies fail to provide comprehensive empirical evidence.\n\nAnother view at odds with liberalism is that technological innovation and industrialization increase the ability of some countries to exercise power. As trade flows and the level of interdependence increases, so do the incentives for states to take military actions to reduce their economic vulnerability.\n\nThe adverse effect of trade on state security is difficult to determine, however the more competition, the more aggressive the environment. Openness and competition increases social instability because domestic prices need to adjust to changes in international prices. Consistent with the realists view that states are essentially always in conflict, social instability and resource competition are motives for conflict and states will rely on the use of force to attain their own political goals and interests.\n\nA number of international relations scholars, notably Xiang, Xu & Keteku 2007; Mearsheimer 2001, recognise the role of military power in initiating conflict, as well as the role militarily powerful countries play in international trade. One argument suggests that militarily capable countries are more likely to have the motivation to initiate armed conflict due to their awareness of their capabilities and to their confidence in achieving favourable outcomes.\n\nA second argument suggests that power facilitates trade. Third, there are positive benefits from economic interdependence on military power. Finally, the economic stature of a country determines both the military power and level of trade of that country, hinting that economic powerful states trade more. Because powerful countries are better positioned to take advantage of the benefits resulting from international trade and to transform welfare gains into military power, they also are more likely to use force when their positions are threatened.\n\nSimilarly, Gartzke & Hewitt (2010) argue that the “extension of economic and other interests beyond national borders increases incentives to police relevant regions and exercise influence, sometimes through force.”\n\nThe motives for conflict, which historically were concentrated among the powerful and their ambitious challengers, are today clustered among the poor, and between the poor and the rich (Gartzke & Hewitt (2010). Theory has prompted to inequality as a potential source of internal conflict. ”Inequalities within the same countries has increased, not through impoverishment of the masses, but because while wealth is created many people remain left behind in poverty. Thus, we have an unequal peace.\" Around 60 countries suffer not only from low GDP per capita but also low or negative growth. These countries tend to be caught in armed conflict among other development traps. Some argue that the evidence surrounding inequality and conflict remains inconclusive, calling for further empirical studies.\n\nStudies show that states with the most dissimilar interests possess a motive for conflict but whether they experience conflict (or not) depends on external determinants of bargaining success or failure. These determinants include uncertainty about the balance of power, opponent’s resolve as well as policy dissimilarities between competing states. Interests are important determinants of whether conflict occurs. According to Gartzke & Hewitt (2010), promoting democratic interests, or even imposing them for peace, is not likely to reduce conflict “it may even lead to a weakening of the actual determinants of liberal peace”, thereby increasing interstate tensions. Contemporary research demonstrates that promoting free markets and economic development helps mitigate conflict and promote peace\n\nThe capitalist peace thesis suggests that free markets and economic development contribute to a reduction in interstate conflict.\n\nResearch on the capitalist peace has chosen to pursue the liberal political economy school, with a particular focus on Kant's Perpetual Peace. The same set of theoretical frameworks that evolved in democratic peace research now asserts itself in the capitalist peace (Gartzke & Hewitt 2010, p. 121).\n\nThe capitalist peace sees capitalism as creating conditions to make war more costly and therefore undesirable by trading states. Traditional interpretations of the capital peace contend that development and global markets will eventually eliminate resource competition as a motive for war. This view was eventually deemed outdated, as “it became clear that needed raw materials would continue to make their way to industrial centers through free markets, rather than through mercantilist autarkies (Gartzke & Hewitt, 2010, p. 122).\n\nThe capitalist theory contends that as economies become stronger, prosperous capitalist states no longer need to threaten one another over access to inputs to production. Consequently, the security dilemma loses its relevance.\n\nScholars like Michael Mousseau argue that democracies are only peaceful in pairs. Other research has demonstrated that the democratic peace is even more exclusive than previously imagined, limiting the finding to developed democracies. Gartzke and Hewitt (2010) challenged this by demonstrating that it is economic development and market freedoms, rather than political liberty that result in interstate peace.\n\nInternational Government Organisations (IGOs) are designed to promote cooperation and inhibit political disputes. Institutional ties promote the exchange of information about the economic gains and losses of participating member states, thereby reducing uncertainty about the distribution of benefits.\n\nRegional institutions also present great influence in addressing issues beyond trade. Regional economic institutions help develop trade expectations for the future. “High economic stakes that states have in the continuation and growth of economic activity in the context of economic regionalism lead to a security community in which states develop a genuine interest in not only keeping peace with each other, but also defending their relationship against outside aggressors.” In addition to their role in dispute settlement, regional arrangements can deter aggressors from targeting institutionally connected states.\n\nAydin (2010) makes an important contribution to the extended deterrence literature and economic peace research through his empirical study on the deterrent effect of economic integration. This study shows that trade has a general deterrent effect on attackers when the target is economically integrated with potential defenders through regional trade institutions. When trade is conducted in an institutionalised setting it can have political implications beyond bilateral interdependence.\n\nResearch shows that economic integration decreases the opportunities to fight and enhances the opportunities to intervene in crisis. Mansfield & Pevehouse (2000, p. 776) present strong evidence that “the combination of PTA membership (preferential trading arrangements) and a high level of trade is quite likely to discourage belligerence.”\n\nMany PTAs have become venues for addressing political disputes between participants and fostering cooperation. Observers have widely acknowledged, for example, that ASEAN has helped to manage tensions in Southeast Asia. Mercado Comun del Sur (MERCOSUR) has done likewise, improving political-military relations throughout the southern cone. (Mansfield & Pevehouse, 2000, p. 781). The reciprocal nature of this system helps guarantee that economic concessions made by one state will be repaid, rather than exploited by its counterpart.\n\nAnother area to add to the existing literature on economic integration is the impact of militarized conflict on foreign investment.\n\nBussman’s (2010) contribution to the liberal notion that conflict inhibits foreign investment, complements the liberal peace arguments in conflict studies. Bussman’s research shows that international conflict reduces international investment flows considerably.\n\nBussman contends that “as with trade, foreign investment could be an important factor in promoting peace. States might avoid violent conflict in order not to deter foreign investors.” By ensuring political stability, states can thus create an environment that is desirable to foreign investors. It is therefore, in the best interest of states to keep away from belligerent behaviour as they could potentially miss out on the welfare gains associated with foreign investment.\n\nAs a result, states that benefit from foreign direct investment flows are less likely to experience the onset of militarized conflict.\n\n"}

In it, the player moves through several rounds of running a lemonade stand, beginning each round by making choices dependent on their current amount of money about their stock, prices, and advertising. In each round, the results are randomized based on the player's inputs, as well as affected by random events such as thunderstorms and street closures. Each round ends with a summary of the player's current status, and the game ends after 12 rounds.\n\nIn 1979, the game was ported by Charlie Kellner to the Apple II; Apple subsequently included the game with their computers throughout the 1980s. MECC also offered the game for sale as a part of bundles of children's software for Apple computers and Atari 8-bit computers. Kellner's source code was released, and has since been ported to modern computers as a free, open-source game. Reviewers of the game, both contemporary and retroactive, viewed the game as a good primer for children into business and decision making processes.\n\nThe game simulates a child's lemonade stand, where choices made by the player regarding prices, advertising, etc. will determine the success or failure of the enterprise. The game owed its success to offering just enough variables to make a complex challenge for users, but still providing a simply-grasped introduction to running a business.\n\nThe player is first given a weather report for the day (sunny, cloudy, or hot and dry, each accompanied by a color drawing) and is prompted for three values: the number of glasses of lemonade to make, the number of advertising signs, and the cost of lemonade per glass. The program then gives a report of the earnings for that day. A thunderstorm, sometimes occurring on cloudy days and accompanied by an animation, will void any profits and cause the player to lose any investment for the day. Other random events, such as street closures or the wind blowing away some signs, can also occur. The game ends after 12 rounds, or days. The game can be played either single-player or with up to 30 players (each player is independent and the sales of one do not affect another). The Apple II version included music, with bars from \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,\" and \"Summertime\" played at appropriate moments. It also added color to the thunderstorm animation.\n\n\"Lemonade Stand\" was originally developed by Bob Jamison of the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium in 1973 for time-shared mainframe computers. Charlie Kellner ported the game to the Apple II platform in February 1979, and Apple included it for free with their computers throughout the 1980s.\n\nIn 1982 David H. Ahl reviewed the game along with five other business management simulations in \"Creative Computing\"; he indicated that it was simpler than most, and likely aimed at children, and said that it was a good teaching game for children about businesses. He also noted that it was free on Apple computers, and available for sale for the same system as part of a bundle of seven games for children for US$25 from MECC. MECC also sold the game as part of a package for Atari 8-bit computers. Elizabeth Ghaffari, in \"Tapping the Wisdom that Surrounds You\", claimed that the game was \"the perfect vehicle to introduce the microcomputer to family and friends and to convince them that technology could be a fun and positive force in their life.\"\n\nKellner's Applesoft BASIC source code has been available since 1979. The game was later ported to modern REALbasic and released as free and open-source software for many platforms like Windows and macOS.\n\nThe game was published in Israel in Hebrew in the 1980s.\n\n\n"}

The Act was originally drafted in 1866 by the 3rd India Law Commission and introduced in December, 1867 in the Council and it was referred to a Select Committee. Objections were raised by the mercantile community to the numerous deviations from the English Law which it contained. The Bill had to be redrafted in 1877. After the lapse of a sufficient period for criticism by the Local Governments, the High Courts and the chambers of commerce, the Bill was revised by a Select Committee. In spite of this Bill could not reach the final stage. In 1880 by the Order of the Secretary of State, the Bill had to be referred to a new Law Commission. On the recommendation of the new Law Commission the Bill was re-drafted and again it was sent to a Select Committee which adopted most of the additions recommended by the new Law Commission. The draft thus prepared for the fourth time was introduced in the Council and was passed into law in 1881 being the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (Act No.26 of 1881)\n\nThe most important class of Credit Instruments that evolved in India were termed Hundi. Their use was most widespread in the twelfth century, and has continued till today. In a sense, they represent the oldest surviving form of credit instrument. These were used in trade and credit transactions; they were used as remittance instruments for the purpose of transfer of funds from one place to another. In Modern era Hundi served as traveller's cheques.\n\nAccording to Section 13 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, \"A \"negotiable instrument\" means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer.' But in Section 1, it is also described that Local extent, Saving of usage relating to hundis, etc., Commencement. -It extends to the whole of India but nothing herein contained affects the Indian Paper Currency Act, 1871, Section 2, or affects any local usage relating to any instrument in an oriental language.

In order to ensure promptitude and remedy against the defaulters of the Negotiable Instrument a criminal remedy of penalty was inserted in Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by amending it with Negotiable Instruments Act, 1988.\n\nWith the insertion of these provisions in the Act the situation certainly improved and the instances of dishonour have relatively come down but on account of application of different interpretative techniques by different High Courts on different provisions of the Act it further compounded and complicated the situation although on dishonour of cheques the trends of the verdicts of the Supreme Court of India\n\nParliament enacted the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 (55 of 2002), which is intended to plug the loopholes.

{"id": "6327287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6327287", "title": "Permanent establishment", "text": "Permanent establishment\n\nA permanent establishment (PE) is a fixed place of business which generally gives rise to income or value-added tax liability in a particular jurisdiction. The term is defined in many income tax treaties and in most European Union Value Added Tax systems. The tax systems in some civil-law countries impose income taxes and value-added taxes only where an enterprise maintains a PE in the country concerned. Definitions of PEs under tax law or tax treaties may contain specific inclusions or exclusions.\n\nThe concept of permanent establishment emerged in the German Empire after 1845, culminating with the German Double Taxation Act of 1909. Initially the objective was to prevent double taxation between Prussian municipalities and this was extended to the entire German federation. In 1889, the first bilateral tax treaty, including the concept of permanent establishment, was concluded between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Prussia, marking the first time the concept was used in international tax law. After years of preparatory works, in 1928, the League of Nations developed a model to tackle cross-border double taxation and to counter tax evasion. Since then, an extensive network of bilateral tax treaty was gradually established, particularly through the influence of the OECD Model Tax Convention, where this concept persisted.\n\nIn the OECD Model Tax Convention, essentially three types of PEs can be construed:\nThe UN Model Tax Convention, which gives greater consideration to developing countries, adds what is known by service permanent establishment in article 5(3)b. Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, have been trying to extend the concept of service PE into a virtual service PE.\n\nUnder the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project being developed by the OECD and endorsed by the G20, a new nexus based on significant digital presence is being considered under Action 1, aimed at \"Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy.\"\n\nThe starting point for determination if a permanent establishment exists is generally a fixed place of business. The definition of permanent establishment in article 5 of the OECD Model Income Tax Treaty is followed in most income tax treaties.\n\nThe commentary indicates that a fixed place of business has three components:\n\nThe requirements of what constitutes a \"'permanent establishment\"' within the scope of a particular treaty depend on what interpretation a particular country places on that term, in context of the text of that treaty. As per Article 3 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, no one is entitled to claim rights under a particular treaty unless otherwise authorised by the contracting state. Therefore, if a particular contracting state places a different meaning on the term 'permanent establishment' than what the taxpayer seeks to place, the taxpayer would be left with virtually no remedy within that state, other than to seek a mutual agreement to that dispute with the other contracting state to that treaty.\n\nThe OECD Model Tax Convention includes a short indicative list of \"prima facie\" permanent establishments. These, however, are not automatically permanent establishments as the requirements set out, namely, for fixed place of business permanent establishment must be met. The list is as follows:\n\nMany treaties explicitly exclude from the definition of PE places where certain activities are conducted. Generally, these exclusions do not apply if non-excluded activities are conducted at the fixed place of business. Among the excluded activities are:\n\nMany treaties provide specific rules with respect to construction sites. Under those treaties, a building site or construction or installation project constitutes a PE only if it lasts more than a specified length of time. The amount of time varies by treaty.\n\nIn addition, the activities of a dependent agent may give rise to a PE for the principal. Dependent agents may include employees or others under the control of the principal. A company is generally not considered an agent solely by reason of ownership of the agent company by the principal. However, activities of an independent agent generally are not attributed to the principal.\n\nSome treaties deem a PE to exist for an enterprise of one country performing services in the other country for more than a specified length of time or for a related enterprise.\n\nIn October 2015, the OECD released the final reports on the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. Action 7 was targeted at \"Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status\" and proposes a large number of changes that are set to be included in the next version of the OECD Model Tax Convention. The OECD expects many of these changes to be applied to currently existing tax treaties through the work based on Action 15 on \"Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties\". A large number of countries are involved in the negotiations that are expected to be concluded by the end of 2016.\n\nThe final report on Action 7 proposes substantial changes to the definition of Agency PE and stricter requirements to the exclusions provision:\"These changes will ensure that where the activities that an intermediary exercises in a country are intended to result in the regular conclusion of contracts to be performed by a foreign enterprise, that enterprise will be considered to have a taxable presence in that country unless the intermediary is performing these activities in the course of an independent business. The changes will also restrict the application of a number of exceptions to the definition of permanent establishment to activities that are preparatory or auxiliary nature and will ensure that it is not possible to take advantage of these exceptions by the fragmentation of a cohesive operating business into several small operations; they will also address situations where the exception applicable to construction sites is circumvented through the splitting-up contracts between closely related enterprises.\"\n"}

He is also a founding member, along with his brothers Luis and Eduardo, of Luz y Fuerza de San Lorenzo Sociedad Anónima—better known as Lufussa—the largest electricity supplier in Honduras.\n\nBorn in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Kafie received a Bachillerato en Ciencias y Letras from the Instituto San Francisco in 1965, and then moved to Washington, D.C., United States to attend Georgetown University. He graduated from Georgetown with a Bachelor of Business Administration in 1971. Kafie worked for his parents' business until 1974, when he established New Mark Representaciones S. R. L., which \"represented domestic and international companies\" conducting business in Honduras. In 1984 Kafie was named \"Honorary Consul of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\" in Honduras.\n\nIn 1988, Kafie founded Lacthosa, initially as a dairy company, and in 1994, he and his brothers founded Lufussa. In 2004, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Central America (FEMAMCO) awarded Kafie the \"Orden FEMAMCO\" for promoting and strengthening Central American integration, as operator of Lacthosa. Through these companies, the wealth and influence of the Kafie family substantially increased, to the point that a 2006 study by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation named Kafie one of \"the most powerful men in Honduras\", citing Kafie's role with respect to Lufussa. Kafie has also been noted by a number of studies to be influential in a variety of other product categories, particularly including the dairy and fruit juice products sold by Lacthosa.\n\nIn 2006, Kafie, along with his brothers Luis and Eduardo, established the Fundación Chito y Nena Kafie (Chito and Nena Kafie Foundation), a family charitable organization, named for their parents (using their familiar names). The charity has engaged in a variety of projects aimed at improving the lives of Hondurans. In June 2017, for example the Foundation entered into a collaboration with the San Felipe General Hospital called \"La Cajita de Nena\" to donate natal care boxes providing supplies for mothers who give birth there.\n\nKafie married Marlene Nasser, a sister of Fredy Nasser in 1982. They have four daughters Stephanie, Elena, Vivian, and Marianne, all four of whom work for Lacthosa. Kafie's daughter Elena is Marketing and Sales Director for Lacthosa, and daughter Marianne is also a Lacthosa executive.\n"}

The film was edited by Jason Ocasio and scored by Bill Cruz.\n\nThe film officially premiered at the Montreal International Haitian Film Festival, but preview screenings in Paris and Miami led to heated controversy.\n\nThe Miami screening of the film, which included many members of the Hispanic media of South Florida and from the Dominican Republic, was the subject of a cease and desist order one hour before the time of screening, as well as a bribery scandal when several radio producers came forward to state that Dominican diplomats had offered them bribes to disrupt the screening and give the film a bad review.\nThe Paris screening of the film was also the subject of a sabotage attempt.\n\nThe film was an \"Official Selection\" at Unifem's Through Women's Eyes Film Festival, the New Orleans International Human Rights Film Festival, and the Buffalo Niagara Film Festival. It was also an \"Official Selection\" at both the Miami International Film Festival and the Women's International Film Festival, but was withdrawn from both South Florida festivals, ostensibly due to pressure from the sugar industry.\n\n\"The Sugar Babies\" won the Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the Delray Beach Film Festival, was screened in film festivals and educational venues, and toured with Amnesty International in France.\n\n"}

Most surveys collect information about an individual (socio-economic, demographic, etc.), their household (size, structure, relationships), and a diary of their journeys on a given day (their start and end location, start and end time, mode of travel, accompaniment and purpose of travel).\n\nMajor travel surveys are conducted in metropolitan areas typically once a decade. Some regions, notably metropolitan Seattle, Washington conduct a panel survey, which interviews the same people year after year, to see how their particular behavior evolves over time.\n\nAuckland, New Zealand - A travel survey was conducted in 2006 and involved 6,000 households in the greater Auckland region.\n\nBrisbane, Australia - The South East Queensland Travel Survey collects travel data in the Greater Brisbane region and the neighbouring areas of Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. The continuous survey commenced in 2003 and surveys around 6,000 households every two years.\n\nHobart, Australia - The Greater Hobart Household Travel Survey collects information from 200 households each month.\n\nLondon, United Kingdom - The London Travel Demand Survey covers 8,000 households annually. Data is collected via face to face interviews.\n\nSydney, Australia - The continuous Household Travel Survey collects travel data annually for approximately 3,500 households in the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Region.\n\nWashington, United States - The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments conducted a 10,000 household survey in 2007.\n\nSouthern Ontario, the Transportation Tomorrow Survey was conducted in 2005-6 (two phases: September 2005 -> January 2006 and September 2006 -> February 2007). This is a repeat survey using essentially the same instrument as conducted in 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001 and most recently 2006 where 149,631 households comprise the final database. The survey was conducted using telephone interviews with an advance letter sent to households to solicit their participation.\n\nDenmark's most recent National Travel was initiated in 2006 and has been going on continuously since then. The interviews are conducted using the internet and telephone interviews.\n\nGermany is conducting its National Travel Survey since 1994 on a yearly basis. Each household member fills in a travel diary in which he records each trip made during the course of one week. Despite this yearly survey there is another non regular scheduled survey which is conducted again in 2008. 25,000 households are expected to participate.\n\nThe Netherlands National Travel Survey surveyed around 34,500 households in 2003. The survey has been conducted yearly since 1985, but with some changes in methodology. Survey forms are mailed out, with follow-up motivational phone calls.\n\nIn New Zealand the Ministry of Transport annually surveys 4,600 households for a two-day period. Data is collected via face to face interviews.\n\nThe United Kingdom Department for Transport conducts the National Travel Survey \n\nThe United States last conducted the National Household Travel Survey in 2009.\n\nSouth Africa conducted its first National Household Travel Survey in 2003.
