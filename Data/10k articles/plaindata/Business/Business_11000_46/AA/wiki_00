Ehrenberg\n\nAndrew Ehrenberg (1 May 1926 – 25 August 2010) was a statistician and marketing scientist. For over half a century, he made contributions to the methodology of data collection, analysis and presentation, and to understanding buyer behaviour and how advertising works.\nAndrew Ehrenberg was born in Germany in 1926 into a well-known academic family. His father was Hans Ehrenberg, his uncle was the historian Victor Ehrenberg, and Geoffrey and Lewis Elton his cousins. He moved to England with his parents in 1938, and attended Queen's College, Taunton. Subsequently, he studied statistics at Kings College, Newcastle and Cambridge University.\n\nIn 1951, he became Lecturer in Statistics at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, and in 1955 moved into commercial marketing research and consulting, where his writings on statistical methodology in marketing research and wider fields soon became well-known. In 1970, he was invited to take the Chair of Marketing and Communication at the London Business School, where he remained for 23 years, eventually taking up a Research Chair.\n\nIn 1993, Ehrenberg became Professor of Marketing at the London South Bank University where he founded the Centre for Research in Marketing, and started the Research and Development Initiative which was funded by businesses internationally to pursue and disseminate quantitative marketing knowledge. The R. and D. I. became closely associated with the Marketing Science Centre at the University of South Australia and in 2004, Ehrenberg was succeeded as Director of the R. and D. I. by Professor Byron Sharp of the School of Marketing at UNISA. In 2005, Ehrenberg retired completely from the R. and D. I.\n\nThe Marketing Science Centre has now been expanded by the University of South Australia to form The Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science and the Centre for Research in Marketing at LSBU was renamed the Ehrenberg Centre for Research in Marketing in 2005, and Dr. Dag Bennett is now the director. The former R. and D. I. has been incorporated into both the above.\n\nEhrenberg held the rare distinction of having been awarded the Gold Medal of the British Market Research Society twice, first in 1969 and again in 1996. He also held the Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Statistical Society. In December 2005 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of South Australia. In 2010, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award of the (American) Advertising Research Foundation.\nEhrenberg wrote six books and over 200 publications. He retired at the age of 80.\n\nAn early interest in social science applications of statistics had already begun to show through in Cambridge (such as extensive experiments into the reliability of trained taste-testers for quality assessments and into price subsidies in the food industry). Also developed were two early aversions, the first to multivariate techniques imposed on simple data, and the second to mathematics for its own sake in applied statistics.\n\nEhrenberg's belief that the methods of physical science are applicable to social science was expressed in an article in the hard science journal Nature. In it he asserted that even in a field dominated by people's impulses to buy, that of marketing, there are striking regularities.\n\nThe discovery and development of such lawlike relationships, was described in series of papers. The definitive statement of this position came later in another paper read to the Royal Statistical Society. The summary stated baldly: \nEhrenberg always pointed out that very many models of very different functional form may be generated with almost identical goodness of fit. The selection of an appropriate model form to express a quantitative relationship is governed in his view by the need for:\n\n\nThe failure to use any technique of optimisation either in model form selection or parameter determination has however been widely criticised. Ehrenberg has answered these criticisms by pointing to the absence of published and widely used models generated by conventional techniques. Another criticism is that Ehrenberg's published models deal with relationships between the averages of groups, and thus ignore variability between individuals.\n\nThe ideas in this section were used in one of Ehrenberg's principal fields of work, the study of buyer behaviour.\n\nIn 1955, Ehrenberg moved into marketing research working on consumer panels. His first milestone paper was \"The Pattern of Consumer Purchases\" which showed the applicability of the negative binomial distribution to the numbers of purchases of a brand of consumer goods.\n\nIn the early 1980s, with Gerald Goodhardt and Chris Chatfield, he extended the NBD model to account for brand choices. The generalisation to the multi-brand case was put forward in \"The Dirichlet: A Comprehensive Model of Buying behaviour\" and was read to the Royal Statistical Society. Finally published in 1984 the NBD-Dirichlet model of brand choice successfully modelled the repeated category and brand purchases within a wide variety of markets. 'The Dirichlet', as it became known, accounts for a number of empirical generalisations, including Double Jeopardy, the Duplication of Purchase law, and Natural Monopoly. It has been shown to hold over different product categories, countries, time, and for both subscription and repertoire repeat-purchase markets. It has been described as one of the most famous empirical generalisations in marketing, along with the Bass model of diffusion of innovation. In an independent effort, Bemmaor, and Schmittlein, Bemmaor and Morrison reported the same model. They studied its statistical properties, and in particular as it reduces to the simple NBD model. They labelled the univariate model as the Beta Binomial/Negative Binomial Distribution (BB/NBD). The model has since been extensively applied under this name by both academics and practitioners. \nEhrenberg's work in this field was summarised in the book \"Repeat Buying\".\n\nEhrenberg derived from these models of buyer behaviour a view on advertising for established brands. It mostly serves to publicise the advertised brand, but seldom seems to persuade.\n\nPromotions have only a short-term effect, and do not affect a brand's subsequent sales or brand loyalty. The extra buyers during the promotion have been seen almost all to have bought it before the promotion rather than being the hoped for new buyers.\n\nThis is another strand in Ehrenberg's work. In 1975, he first published \"Data Reduction\". The book has been revised, reprinted and translated (Ehrenberg 1981). It maintains that much of the approach to research methods and prediction depends on finding patterns in data and this is much aided by its presentation in simple tables. Such tables also aid communication of results.\n\nThe basic ideas are very simple. They depend on the principles of how memory works: clear layout of simple tables, rounding of figures, placing figures to be compared in the same column and showing averages.\n\nThis work has had a major effect in on the way data are presented in academia, commerce but less in the British public sector. There the layout of the official British Monthly Digest of Statistics under Sir Harry Campion antedated Ehrenberg by many years, but set a pattern in many ways the same.\n\nOver more than fifty years, Ehrenberg worked not only to discover new principles and understanding, nearly always using data already available. He worked just as hard to communicate — to write simply and understandably, and to present figures in such a way as to tell an understandable story. His tables and charts always supported his communication. They did not ask the readers themselves to undertake the work of extracting meaning from the data. In consequence, they have been criticised as showing only carefully selected data.\n\nEhrenberg drafted and re-drafted, often to the exasperation of his collaborators. He was tireless in presenting and publicising his conclusions on both sides of the Atlantic, though recently to the present writer he observed that his own major failure was in effectively communicating his principles to the users of statistics. His work continues, though, to influence the practice of both statistical science and marketing.\n\nThese include some important papers not specifically mentioned above.\n\n\n"}

He is the co-founder of the Solar Impulse project, the first ever round-the-world solar flight, successfully completed in July 2016. During the Japan-to-Hawaii leg, André broke the world record for longest solo flight in an airplane of any kind: 117 hours and 52 minutes, breaking Steve Fossett's 2006 record. Before that, on 7 July 2010, André completed the first 24-hour solar powered flight. The flight set records for the longest manned solar-powered flight and the greatest height reached by a manned solar aircraft.\n\nHe currently holds 14 FAI world records in: free distance, free distance along a course, straight distance, straight distance predeclared waypoints, distance along a course, duration, absolute altitude, gain of height.\nHis groundbreaking record: the longest solo flight in an airplane of any kind: 117 hours and 52 minutes.\n\nBorschberg flew as a jet pilot in the Swiss Air Force prior to his work with Solar Impulse. An engineer by education and a graduate of the MIT Sloan School of Management, André Borschberg has solid experience in creating and managing companies. His passion for aviation and his interest in innovative solutions have led him to team up with Bertrand Piccard as CEO, co-founder and pilot of Solar Impulse.\n\nFor his role in delivering and piloting Solar Impulse, André was awarded the prestigious Mungo Park Medal by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 2018. This was awarded jointly with Bertrand Piccard.\n\nFascinated by aviation from his earliest youth, André Borschberg trained as a pilot in the Swiss air force, flying first Venoms and then Hunters and Tigers for over 20 years. Today he holds both professional aeroplane and helicopter pilots' licences and also does aerobatics in his spare time.\n\nAfter graduating from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in mechanics and thermodynamics, André Borschberg has constantly developed and led numerous technology projects, companies and start-ups, as both investor and entrepreneur. He very quickly supplemented his training with a Master's in Management Science from the MIT Sloan School of Management, preceded by certificates in financial management and business management at HEC Lausanne. He first joined McKinsey, one of the world's leading business consultancies, as a consultant for five years, before starting his own entrepreneurial activities.\n\nHis strong points are business organisation, management and development. From finance to marketing, from engineering to human resources, André Borschberg has acquired solid experience as an entrepreneur, manager and consultant for over 20 years. He went initially into partnership with a venture capital company, Lowe Finance. His vast range of professional skills, his versatility and his perseverance enabled him to successfully launch two start-ups in the Internet and new technologies field. With a technical team from EPFL, he co-founded Innovative Silicon, a technology company in the field of microprocessor memories.\n\nAndré Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard released in 2017 \"Objectif Soleil\", a book about how they lived through Solar Impulse project.\n\nAt the head of the project Solar Impulse with Bertrand Piccard, André Borschberg brings the essential skills of an entrepreneur who contributes to convert vision into reality. As the CEO, he has put together and motivated a team of 65 top specialists and numerous partners, all from very diverse horizons and origins. \"This diversity we have sought at every level stimulates their creativity and gives them their strength. It is from this pooling of experiences that original and totally-new solutions arise.”\n\nAs a mechanical engineer and pilot, he is directing the construction of the aircraft and the preparation of the flight missions. \"We need to find a way to build an aircraft that is super-robust & super-light at the same time, and above all extremely efficient with energy consumption, so as to need only minuscule amounts of energy in order to fly. But with the same degree of resistance as a normal airplane. Hence the great complexity of the project, which gives the true measure of its philosophy and its objectives.\"\n\nThe emergency department of the Hirslanden Clinique Cecil is the official medical partner of Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg’s world tour for Solar Impulse.\n\n\nOn 7 July 2010, André Borschberg has, for the first time in history, flown 26 hours with the Solar Impulse aeroplane, demonstrating at the same time the possibilities to fly day and night with only solar energy to propel the aeroplane.\n\n\nSolar Impulse HB-SIA, piloted by André Borschberg, completed three international flights during the European campaign: Payerne to Brussels on 13 May (630 km), Brussels to Paris-Le Bourget on 14 June (395 km) and Paris-Le Bourget to Payerne on 3 July (426 km).\n\n\nSolar Impulse, piloted alternately by André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard, made its first intercontinental flight in 2012 from Switzerland (Payerne) to Toulouse, and then on to Morocco.\n\n\nSolar Impulse has completed the historic crossing of the United States over a 2-month period of the summer of 2013. Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg, the two pilots, flew from San Francisco to New York, stopping over in cities along the way.\n\nWith the goal of the world's first solar powered round the world flight initiated on March 9, 2015, these flights have provided good learning opportunities in terms of slotting the solar aircraft into international air space and landing at international airports.\n\nTaking turns at the controls of the airplane with his partner Bertrand Piccard for the first ever round-the-world solar flight, successfully achieved in July 2016.\n\nAndré Borschberg achieved 8 FAI world records flying with \"Solar Impulse 1\". During three historical flights (2010 night flight, 2012 Payerne to Madrid and 2013 Phoenix to Dallas), he was awarded 8 FAI World records: free distance, free distance along a course, straight distance, straight distance predeclared waypoints, distance along a course, duration, absolute altitude, gain of height.\n\nWith the \"Solar Impulse 2\", he broke the record of the longest solo flight, previously held by Steve Fosset. On 3 July 2015, Borschberg flew the solar powered airplane between Nagoya (Japan) and Kalaeloa, Hawaii (US) for a duration of 4 days, 21 hours and 52 minutes.\n\n\n"}

She formed her own cartel after splitting with him. She is alleged to have recruited other models, whom she is quoted referring to as her \"unsuspicious, beautiful angels\" as drug traffickers, paying them up to around $5,000 (£3,200) per trip to transport cocaine from Argentina to England by way of Cancún.\n\nValencia's alleged syndicate was believed to have been exposed on 13 December 2009, when a 21-year-old woman, \"Ariel L\", was arrested with a suitcase containing 55 kg (121 pounds) of cocaine at Ezeiza International Airport, Buenos Aires, Argentina. \"L\" made no attempt to hide the drugs inside her bags, leading authorities to suspect the ring had help from employees. She is reported to have been told that no one at the airport would try to stop her, and an investigation was launched to find employees of the airport with possible links to the syndicate. After questioning \"L\", three additional arrests were made and a warrant was issued for Valencia's arrest. Authorities believed she was still in Argentina after she fled a hotel where she had been staying with her pomeranian. Investigators attempted to trace her location through the address under which the animal was registered, but it only led them to an abandoned warehouse.

The overseas banks usually lend the importer (buyer) based on the letter of comfort (a bank guarantee) issued by the importer's bank. For this service the importer's bank or buyer's credit consultant charges a fee called an arrangement fee.\n\nBuyer's credit helps local importers gain access to cheaper foreign funds that may be closer to LIBOR rates as against local sources of funding which are more costly.\n\nThe duration of buyer's credit may vary from country to country, as per the local regulations. For example, in India, buyer's credit can be availed for one year in case the import is for tradeable goods and for three years if the import is for capital goods.\n\nBuyer's credit has several advantages for the importer.\nThe exporter gets paid on due date; whereas importer gets extended date for making an import payment as per the cash flows.\nThe importer can deal with exporter on sight basis, negotiate a better discount and use the buyers credit route to avail financing.\nThe funding currency can be depending on the choice of the customer and availability of LIBOR rates in the exchange market. \nThe importer can use this financing for any form of payment mode, such as: open account, collections, or LCs.\n\n\nInterest cost is charged by overseas bank as a financing cost.\n\nBuyer's credit is associated with currency risk.\nThus, Hedging may be required as foreign currency is involved, making Buyer's Credit risky at times.\n\nBanks can provide buyer’s credit up to US$20 million (US$ 2 crore) per import transactions for a maximum maturity period of one year from date of shipment. In case of import of capital goods, banks can approve buyer’s credits up to $20 million per transaction with a maturity period of up to three years. No rollover beyond that period is permitted.\n\nAs per RBI directives dated 11.07.13, at the time of availment of trade credit, the period of trade credit should be linked to the operating cycle and trade transaction. AD banks need to ensure that these instructions are strictly complied with.\n\nRBI has issued directions under Sec 10(4) and Sec 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, stating that authorized dealers may approve proposals received (in Form ECB) for short-term credit for financing—by way of either suppliers' credit or buyers' credit—of import of goods into India, based on uniform criteria.

It is often preferred for use on delicate surfaces. CO cleaning has found application in the aerospace, automotive, electronics, medical, and other industries. Carbon dioxide snow cleaning has been used to remove particles and organic residues from metals, polymers, ceramics, glasses, and other materials, and from surfaces including hard drives and optical surfaces.\n\n cleaning has found application in many industries and technical areas, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, medical, manufacturing, basic and applied research, and optics. The different carbon dioxide cleaning methods can remove gross contamination, paint, overlayers, grease, fingerprints, particles down to nanometers in size, hydrocarbon and organic residues, and radioactive residues. Materials cleaned include metals, polymers, ceramics, and glasses. The key limitation is that the contamination must be on the surface, not buried within the material. Porous materials are not good candidates for pellets or snow, but can be cleaned using liquid or supercritical CO.\n\nCarbon dioxide cleaning refers to several different methods for parts cleaning, making use of all phases of : basic methods include solid dry ice pellets, liquid , snow (a hybrid method), and supercritical . The different forms of cleaning can clean many types of objects, from large generators to small and delicate parts, including hard drives and optics.\n\nIn pellet cleaning (\"dry-ice blasting\"), relatively large pellets of solid CO are fired at the surface to be cleaned. These pellets impinge on the surface, mechanically dislodging contaminant particles. Pellet cleaning is only appropriate for surfaces which can withstand significant impacts.\n\nIn CO snow cleaning, compressed liquid or gaseous carbon dioxide is expelled from a nozzle, condensing into a mixture of solid particles and gas, which impact the surface to be cleaned. Jet velocities are frequently supersonic. Snow cleaning works by a combination of momentum transfer (mechanically dislodging contaminant particles) and solvent action. The CO sublimates on contact, increasing in volume up to 800 times, thereby generating pressure to sweep particles away. The CO also dissolves hydrocarbon contaminants, and its low temperature embrittles residues such as fingerprints, making them easier to blow away.\n\nSnow cleaning has found application in the aeronautical, automotive, medical, optical, semiconductor, and space industries. It can provide a gentle cleaning, appropriate for delicate surfaces. The effectiveness of carbon dioxide snow cleaning has been demonstrated via light microscopy, particle counting, scanning electron microscopy, microprobing, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic-force microscopy, and mass spectroscopy.\n\nEquipment costs for a carbon dioxide snow cleaning system can range from US$1500 for a basic system to $50,000 for a high-end automated unit. Material costs are comparatively low, although ultra-pure CO must often be used to avoid the introduction of new contaminants.\n\nAt temperatures and pressures above its critical point, CO can be maintained as a supercritical fluid, exhibiting extremely low viscosity and high solvency. To apply this method, parts to be cleaned are enclosed in a pressure vessel that is then filled with supercritical CO. This method is appropriate for small and delicate parts such as microelectronics, and is not ideal for particulate removal. Aside from cleaning, applications of supercritical carbon dioxide include targeted chemical supercritical fluid extraction and materials processing.\n\nLiquid CO washing, like supercritical fluid CO washing, relies on the high solvent power of CO, but at lower temperatures and pressures, the latter making it simpler to implement. Because liquid CO does not have the solvent power of supercritical fluid, agitation and surfactants may be added to improve the effectiveness of the method. Liquid CO has been used in dry cleaning and machined parts degreasing.\n\nCarbon dioxide cleaning was contemplated in the 1930s, and the \"pellet\" approach was developed in the 1970s by E.E. Rice, C.H. Franklin, and C.C. Wong.\n\nThe introduction of CO snow cleaning, with its ability to remove sub-micron-scale particles, is credited to Stuart Hoenig of the University of Arizona, who first published on the topic in 1985-1986. Hoenig traveled the US to demonstrate the technology, eventually attracting the interest of The BOC Group, which developed Venturi nozzles for the process, and Hughes Aircraft, which developed straight nozzles. CO snow cleaning was further developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA, for the purpose of removing paint from aircraft fuselages.\n\nNozzle design is the most significant factor in carbon dioxide snow cleaning performance, affecting the size and velocity of the dry ice particles. Variations in nozzle design have been developed by W.H. Whitlock, L.L. Layden, Applied Surface Technologies, and Sierra Systems Group.\n\nCO cleaning may present certain safety risks. If the process is used to remove hazardous materials, precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to these materials in the vent stream. Because the CO stream is cryogenic, it may cause injury with direct skin contact. In addition, care must be taken to prevent the concentration of carbon dioxide in the work area from exceeding safe levels.\n\nSome commercial grades of carbon dioxide may contain traces of heavy hydrocarbons, which can be left behind on the surface being cleaned. Abrasive particles originating in the cleaning equipment itself may need to be filtered out as well. The low temperature of the carbon dioxide stream can also induce moisture condensation on the part, which may be mitigated with hot plates, heat guns, heat lamps, or dry boxes.\n\nIonization caused by the flowing gas can result in potentially damaging static charge buildup on non-conductive parts. This can be mitigated by grounding or positive ionization sources.\n"}

Different objectives are available, some require the player to finish on a certain position in the company ranking list while others require the transportation of a specific amount of cargo. In some cases these objectives have additional limits, such as that the player must finish within a certain time limit. While many of the scenarios are fictional, some are based on real-world countries such as the United States, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn recent years, several add-ons have been created for the game, including hundreds of trains, trucks, airplanes and other vehicles.

The method was designed by psychiatrist Frank Ochberg in the early 1990s. Ochberg, who'd previously helped to define and characterize posttraumatic stress disorder, began using the CM in his private practice as a means of combating PTSD symptoms.\n\nDuring the CM, the clinician asks the PTSD client to recall a traumatic memory while the clinician counts out loud to 100. After the counting the client is asked to discuss their memory. Subsequently, clinician and client work to reframe that traumatic memory and minimize or eliminate the discomfort associated with it.\n\n\nA recent study sought to compare the CM to other existing forms of PTSD treatment. The study divided 38 women among three forms of PTSD therapy, including the CM. All three treatments worked very well in minimizing PTSD symptoms; additionally, the study showed that the CM may be as effective as other pre-established techniques in the treatment of PTSD.\n\n"}

Joseph was the son of Francis Martin Drexel, the immigrant ancestor of the Drexel banking family in the United States.\n\nElizabeth was an author, who published two books, \"\"King Lehr\" and the Gilded Age\" (1935) and \"Turn of the World\" (1937). Her first novel, published after the death of her second husband, was described as follows in \"Time Magazine\", \"A bitter, disillusioned book, 'King Lehr' is memorable for the lurid light it throws on U.

Society of the Gilded Age, may confidently be opened as one of the most startling and scandalously intimate records of life among the wealthy yet written by one of them.\" It tells the story of her unhappy marriage to Lehr, which was referred to as a \"tragic farce\" of a 28-year marriage.\n\nAs with her first book, her second, and first as Lady Decies, \"Turn of the World\" was a fascinating semi-autobiographical history of American high society during the Gay Nineties up through the first World War.

Together, they had two sons:\n\n\nDuring this marriage, she made generous donations to Roman Catholic charities and to Georgetown University, including funds for the construction of Dahlgren Chapel, named for her first son. The latter asked for her portrait, which was painted in 1899 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947). Dahlgren died August 11, 1899, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he had gone in hopes of recovering from an illness.\n\nIn June 1901, Elizabeth married Henry Symes Lehr (1869–1929), aka Harry Lehr. The marriage was never consummated. On her wedding night, she was informed by her husband that he loathed her and could not stand the thought of touching her ever, although he wanted her to understand she was to be cordial to him in public and he might in turn occasionally call her \"darling\". He had, he admitted, married her for her money because poverty terrified him.\n\nIn 1915, the Lehrs were in Paris, and Elizabeth worked for the Red Cross. They remained in Paris after World War I, where they bought in 1923 the \"Hôtel de Canvoie\" at 52, rue des Saints-Pères in the 7th arrondissement.

Lee (c. 1818 – 1851) was a soldier and politician in Oregon Country in the 1840s. A member of Virginia’s Lee family, he was part of the Fremont Expedition and commanded troops during the Cayuse War in what became the Oregon Territory. He also was a member of the Oregon Provisional Government and the second editor of the \"Oregon Spectator\".\n\nLee was born in Virginia, circa 1818. In 1843, Lee was a part of John C. Frémont’s Army expedition through the Western United States, including what is now the state of Oregon. During the expedition he was sent with a note to Kit Carson ordering Carson to catch up to the group, and later when the party split into two Lee remained with Fremont before returning to Oregon on September 22.\n\nAfter settling in Oregon, Lee was elected to the Provisional Legislature of Oregon in 1845. He represented the Clackamas District and served as Speaker of the body for part of the December session. In 1846, Lee became the second editor of the \"Oregon Spectator\", the first newspaper in the region. He replaced William G. T'Vault and would remain editor for nine issues of the paper before George Law Curry took over the position.\n\nOn November 29, 1847, the Whitman Mission near present day Walla Walla, Washington, was attacked by members of the Cayuse tribe in the Whitman Massacre. This led to further violence in the ensuing Cayuse War prosecuted by the Provisional Government of Oregon and later the United States government against the Native Americans in what became the Oregon Territory in 1848. In December 1847 when word of the attack reached the Willamette Valley, the Provisional Government and Gov. George Abernethy called for volunteers to fight against the Cayuse, with Lee volunteering and being selected as captain of a 50-man unit to be dispatched immediately to The Dalles. The Oregon Rifles under the command of Lee formed on December 8, and gathered at Fort Vancouver on December 10 where they purchased supplies from the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) post. The HBC would not extend credit to the Provisional Government, so the volunteer soldiers pledged their individual credit in order to purchase supplies with the hope that the government would be able to repay them at a later time. The group was to protect the Methodist Mission there and prevent any hostile forces from reaching the Willamette Valley.\n\nWhile preparation were made for war, the Provisional Government also attempted to negotiate with the Cayuse and other tribes. Lee was appointed as one of the peace commissioners, along with Joel Palmer and Robert Newell to seek a truce with the Cayuse and demand they turn over the killers from the massacre at the start of hostilities. Lee and his troops, with John E. Ross and Joseph Magone as lieutenants, then marched off to The Dalles, arriving on December 21. Upon arriving there, Lee led his men against a band of Native Americans and drove them off, but not before they stole 300 head of cattle. There the troops built a stockade and named the post Fort Lee for the commander, though the small fortification was also called Fort Wascopam. Lee’s forces continued defending the Wascopam Mission and settlers until Colonel Cornelius Gilliam arrived with a larger force in February 1848, at which point Lee became third in command after Gilliam and Lieutenant-Colonel James Waters.\n\nWith a larger force, the militia forces pressed east towards the Whitman Mission, with Lee commanding some troops and carrying out reconnaissance. By March 4 the forces reached the mission after a battle at Sand Hollows. After reaching the mission, Gilliam set out for The Dalles with a small force to supply that settlement, before continuing to Oregon City to report to the governor when he was accidentally shot and killed. Lee continued west with Gilliam’s body and was promoted to Colonel before returning to the front. Once at the front he discovered that the troops had elected Waters as Colonel, so Lee resigned as colonel and took the role as a subordinate to Waters.\n\nAfter leaving the war, Governor Abernethy appointed Lee as superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1848. In 1849, he sought his fortune in the gold mines of the California Gold Rush. He successfully mined there before returning to Oregon and setting up business in Oregon City in 1850. That year Lee traveled by ship to New York to acquire inventory for his store, but died of Panama fever on his return to Oregon in 1851.\n"}

ISDS is an instrument of public international law and provisions are contained in a number of bilateral investment treaties, in certain international trade treaties, such as NAFTA (chapter 11), and the proposed TPP (chapter 9) and CETA (sections 3 and 4) agreements. ISDS is also found in international investment agreements, such as the Energy Charter Treaty. If an investor from one country (the \"home state\") invests in another country (the \"host state\"), both of which have agreed to ISDS, and the host state violates the rights granted to the investor under the treaty, then that investor may bring the matter before an arbitral tribunal.\n\nWhile ISDS is often associated with international arbitration under the rules of ICSID (the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes of the World Bank), it often takes place under the auspices of international arbitral tribunals governed by different rules or institutions, such as the London Court of International Arbitration, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre or the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\nUnder customary international law a state can vindicate injury caused to its nation by the host state by exercising diplomatic protection, which may include retorsion and/or reprisals. In addition to diplomatic protection and to avoid having to resort to coercive means, states can and do establish ad hoc commissions and arbitral tribunals to adjudicate claims involving treatment of foreign nationals and their property by the Host State (\"state-state-dispute-settlement\", SSDS). Notable examples of this practice are the Jay Treaty commissions, the Iran–United States Claims Tribunal and the American-Mexican Claims Commission. However, these treaties were limited to the treatment of foreign investors during a past period of time, whereas modern ISDS allows investors to make claims against states in general and on a prospective basis.\n\nCurrently, the legal protection of Foreign Direct Investment under public international law is guaranteed by a network of more than 2750 bilateral investment treaties (BITs), Multilateral Investment Treaties, most notably the Energy Charter Treaty and number of Free Trade Agreements such as NAFTA containing a chapter on investment protection. Most of these treaties were signed by states in the late 1980s and early 1990s, before the current explosion of investor claims under the treaties began in the late 1990s.\n\nThe majority of these legal instruments provides foreign investors with a substantive legal protection (including the right to \"fair and equitable treatment\", \"full protection and security\", \"free transfer of means\" and the right not to be directly or indirectly expropriated without full compensation) and access to ISDS for redress against Host States for breaches of such protection. Some of these standards are framed in vague terms, given extensive discretion to arbitrators in their interpretation and application. The overall number of known cases reached over 500 in 2012. Of these, 244 were concluded, of which approximately 42% were decided in favour of the Host State and approximately 31% in favour of the investor. Approximately 27% of the cases were settled out of court.\nNotably, only foreign investors can sue states under investment treaties, because states are the parties to the treaty, and only states can be held liable to pay damages for breach of the treaty. States have no corresponding right to bring an original claim against a foreign investor under such treaties, again because investors are not parties to the treaty and therefore cannot be in breach of it. Thus, a decision in favour of the State means that the state has not been ordered to pay compensation, not that it has received any compensation from the investor, although costs can be awarded against the investor. A state cannot \"win\" in ISDS in the manner of a foreign investor - a state which wishes to sue a foreign investor does so through its own domestic courts, without the need for a treaty.\n\nISDS cannot overturn local laws (unlike the World Trade Organization) which violate trade agreements, but can grant monetary damages to investors adversely affected by such laws. According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, ISDS requires specific treaty violations, and does not allow corporations to sue solely over \"lost profits\". However, such violations may be difficult to foresee, and the threat of exorbitant fines may cause a chilling effect which halts regulation or legislation in the public interest (e.g. human health and environmental protection). Critics also state that treaties are written so that any legislation causing lost profits is per definition a treaty violation, rendering the argument null that only treaty violations are subject to ISDS.\n\nA notable example of ISDS, which has been in existence for two decades now, is Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA Chapter 11 allows investors of one NAFTA party (Canada, United States or Mexico) to bring claims directly against the government of another NAFTA party before an international arbitral tribunal. Because NAFTA Article 1121 waives the local remedies rule, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before filing Chapter 11 claims. While this fact has been amply criticized in public, proponents of ISDS tend to point out that speedy dispute resolution through ISDS is critical in modern economic environments and would be defeated by adding several instances of local remedies. On the other hand, there is no other situation in international law where a private party can sue a state without showing that the state's domestic courts are not independent or reliable. The removal of the customary duty to exhaust local remedies, where they are reasonably available, is claimed to be a factor in the explosion of investment treaty claims since the late 1990s, although a more obvious explanation is the explosion in the number of bilateral free trade agreements since the breakdown of the multilateral WTO Doha round in the mid 2000s.\n\nInvestors may initiate an arbitration against the NAFTA Party under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL Rules\") or under the Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID Rules\"). NAFTA Chapter 11 was the first instance of an ISDS provision receiving widespread public attention, especially in the United States in the wake of the Methanex case.\n\nResistance from the EU side to the US proposal to include an ISDS clause in the draft Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership treaty was such as to cause this element to be abandoned in September 2015. In its place, the European Commission proposed an investment court system (ICS). Not long afterwards, ICS was declared illegal by the German Association of Magistrates, though the Commission dismissed the magistrates' judgement as based on a misunderstanding. For its part, the United States wants ISDS reinstated.\n\nMuch debate and criticism has arisen concerning the impact of ISDS on the capacity of governments to implement reforms and legislative and policy programs related to public health, environmental protection and human rights.\n\nOpponents argue that investor state claims (or the threat of them) inhibit the capacity of domestic governments to pass legislation addressing perfectly legitimate public concerns, such as health and environmental protection, labour rights or human rights.\n\nProponents of ISDS argue that governments retain their regulatory ability, if the agreements in question specify that regulations protecting health, the environment, labour rights and human rights are allowed. The Office of the United States Trade Representative challenges the notion that ISDS challenges \"the sovereign ability of governments impose any measure they wish to protect labor rights, the environment, or other issues of public welfare\". The International Bar Association (IBA) mirrors these sentiments, noting that \"while investment treaties limit states’ ability to inflict arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, they do not limit (and, in fact, expressly safeguard) a state’s sovereign right to regulate in the public interest in a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory manner.\" The White House notes that investment protections are a component of more than 3,000 trade agreements, the vast majority of which have some form of neutral arbitration. The United States is party to at least 50 such agreements, has only faced 13 ISDS cases and never lost an ISDS case.\n\nThe Peterson Institute for International Economics claims that ISDS provisions are necessary, as they boost investment: \"empirical evidence has shown that treaties including these provisions have a positive effect on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between signatory countries.\" PIIE challenges the claim that ISDS \"arbitrators lack integrity\", noting that arbitrators take an oath of impartiality and both sides of a case choose arbitrators.\n\nIn a February 2016 op-ed against the TPP, Senator Elizabeth Warren used the example of a French company suing Egypt because Egypt raised its minimum wage as an argument against the ISDS provisions of the TPP. The Washington Post editorial board has however challenged this characterization of the case, noting that \"Veolia of France, a waste management company, invoked ISDS to enforce a contract with the government of Alexandria, Egypt, that it says required compensation if costs increased; the company maintains that the wage increases triggered this provision. Incidentally, Veolia was working with Alexandria on a World Bank-supported project to reduce greenhouse gases, not some corporate plot to exploit the people. The case — which would result, at most, in a monetary award to Veolia, not the overthrow of the minimum wage — remains in litigation.\"\n\nAccording to the International Bar Association (IBA), states have won a higher percentage of ISDS cases than investors, and that around one-third of all cases end in settlement. Claimant investors, when successful, recover on average less than half of what the amounts claimed. IBA notes that \"only 8 per cent of ISDS proceedings are commenced by very large multinational corporations.\" IBA challenges the notion that ISDS is biased against developing countries, noting that there is \"no correlation between the success rates of claims against states and their income levels or development status.\" IBA notes that ISDS is necessary even in countries with sophisticated domestic legal systems because those domestic courts rule according to domestic laws, not international law. IBA notes that \"increasingly, awards require the losing party to pay arbitration costs and legal fees to the winning party\", which deters investors from initiating unmeritorious cases.\n\nA 2017 study found that the success rates of investors in investor-state disputes has sharply fallen over time because most legal challenges today seek compensation for regulation implemented by democracies, not expropriation by non-democracies. The author of the study argues that the likely goal of investors is not to obtain compensation through ISDS, but to impose costs on governments contemplating regulations and therefore deter the regulatory ambitions of governments.\n\nOpponents of ISDS argue that arbitrations are sometimes carried out in secret by trade lawyers who do not enjoy the typical safeguards of judicial independence and procedural fairness, who earn income only if a case is brought and proceeds, and who are not accountable to the public or required to take into account broader constitutional and international law human rights norms. The Peterson Institute for International Economics agrees \"that secrecy has gone too far\" in many ISDS cases, but notes that agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership did ensure greater transparency in ISDS. Proponents of ISDS point out that confidentiality is a standard feature of all arbitration and one that enables a constructive, de-politicized and fact-oriented atmosphere of dispute resolution. On the other hand, such traditional confidentiality is limited to disputes that affect the parties in question and not the broader public. Also, most ICSID awards, although confidential, are de facto published by consent of the parties. However, many awards under other arbitration rules are not public and, in the case of investor-arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce, there is a requirement for blanket confidentiality for all aspects of a case.\n\nIt is further pointed out that judges are not elected in most countries outside the US, so that \"public accountability of judges\" may not be considered a standard of public international law. In any event, they say, the qualification of ISDS arbitrators matches or exceeds the qualification of most court judges. In response, critics make the point that any judge, whether domestic or international, who is part of a legal system not shown to be systematically biased or unreliable, has a greater claim to independence than an arbitrator because they are insulated from conflicts of interest that arise when arbitrators work on the side as lawyers, and is assigned cases in an objective manner rather than by the discretion of a disputing party or an executive official. Arbitrators are appointed by both parties at dispute, so such conflicts of interest may arise on both sides.\n\nWhile ISDS has traditionally been confidential as any other arbitration, the general trend in the last decade has been to allow for more openness and transparency. On the other hand, there is still widespread confidentiality in the system.\n\nUnder Art. 29 of the U.S. Model-BIT of 2004, all documents pertaining to ISDS have to be made public and amicus curiae briefs are allowed. However, no investment treaty allows other parties who have an interest in the dispute, other than the claimant investor and respondent government, to obtain standing in the adjudicative process.\n\nUnder the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, the tribunals shall, subject to the consent of the disputing parties, conduct hearings open to the public. The tribunal will make available to the public documents relating to the dispute such as the notice of intent, the notice of arbitration, pleadings, memorials, minutes or transcripts of the hearings of the tribunal, where available; orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal. In addition, third parties can and increasingly do participate in investor-state arbitration by submitting \"amicus curiae\" petitions.\n\nThe World Bank's International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) is required by ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22 to make public, information on the registration of all requests for arbitration and to indicate in due course the date and method of the termination of each proceeding. It also publishes the vast majority of awards with the consent of the parties. If the parties do not consent, ICSID publishes excerpts showing the tribunal's reasoning. The ICSID website has published awards for most completed arbitrations, and decisions in investor-state arbitrations outside of ICSID are also publicly available online.\n\nOn 1 April 2014, the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration entered into force. Article 3 foresees a general duty to publish all documents pertaining to an ISDS-procedure under UNCITRAL Rules, where the treaty establishing the ISDS-mechanism has been concluded after 1 April 2014 or where the parties so consent, subject to certain overwhelming confidentiality interests listed in Article 7. Original proposals to make all UNCITRAL arbitration under investment treaties public were not adopted after opposition by some states and by representatives of the arbitration industry who participated in the UNCITRAL working group negotiations as state representatives.\n\nOn 17 March 2015, the United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration ('Mauritius Convention') was opened for signatures in Port Louis, Mauritius. The Mauritius Convention will render the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor State Arbitration also applicable to disputes arising out of investment treaties that were concluded prior to 1 April 2014 if both parties to the investment treaty are also party to the Mauritius Convention. The Convention has not yet entered into force since the three required ratifications have not yet been submitted. 10 States have signed the Mauritius Convention so far.\n\nInvestment disputes can be initiated by corporations and natural persons and in almost all cases, investment tribunals are composed of three arbitrators (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). As in most arbitrations, one is appointed by the investor, one by the state, and the third is usually chosen by agreement between the parties or their appointed arbitrators or selected by the appointing authority, depending on the procedural rules applicable to the dispute. If the parties do not agree who to appoint, this power is assigned to executive officials usually at the World Bank, the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, or a private chamber of commerce.\n\nOther individuals cannot initiate a claim against a state under an investment treaty. Also, no individual or state can initiate a claim against a foreign investor under an investment treaty. This has led to criticisms that investor-state arbitration is not balanced and that it favours the \"haves\" over the \"have nots\" by giving foreign investors, especially major companies, access to a special tribunal outside any court. While the arbitration process itself does not provide explicitly privileged access for larger investors over individuals or SMEs, the costs of ISDS, as in any court or arbitration system, tend to be off-putting for smaller claimants.\n\nAccording to a May 2011 working paper, \"In terms of wins and losses, [the] U.S. has never lost a case as the respondent country. U.S. investors have won 15 cases, lost 22 cases and settled 14 cases. In terms of performance with respect to developing countries, U.S. investors have won 14 cases and lost 17.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter ISDS claims by investors sharply increased starting in the late 1990s, ISDS came under greater public attention and criticism. This was true for the NAFTA claims against the United States in the late 1990s, for Germany in the wake of the Vattenfall claims in the late 2000s and also for Australia in 2011, when confronted with the Philip Morris claim.\n\nIn 2011, the Australian government announced that it would discontinue the practice of seeking inclusion of investor state dispute settlement provisions in trade agreements with developing countries. It stated that it:\n\n\"...supports the principle of national treatment — that foreign and domestic businesses are treated equally under the law. However, the Government does not support provisions that would confer greater legal rights on foreign businesses than those available to domestic businesses. Nor will the Government support provisions that would constrain the ability of Australian governments to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters in circumstances where those laws do not discriminate between domestic and foreign businesses. The Government has not and will not accept provisions that limit its capacity to put health warnings or plain packaging requirements on tobacco products or its ability to continue the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme... In the past, Australian Governments have sought the inclusion of investor-state dispute resolution procedures in trade agreements with developing countries at the behest of Australian businesses. The Gillard Government will discontinue this practice. If Australian businesses are concerned about sovereign risk in Australian trading partner countries, they will need to make their own assessments about whether they want to commit to investing in those countries... Foreign businesses investing in Australia will be entitled to the same legal protections as domestic businesses but the Gillard Government will not confer greater rights on foreign businesses through investor-state dispute resolution provisions.\"\n\nThis statement is a reaction to Philip Morris' ISDS claim under UNCITRAL rules to challenge Australian tobacco Advertising Restrictions. By 2013, Australia had not terminated any bilateral investment treaties allowing for ISDS. Even if it were to do so, most such treaties foresee post-termination-protection for many years after the termination has become effective. In any event, since the election of the conservative Coalition Government in 2013, the Government has entered into free trade agreements (such as the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, Ch 9 section B) that include ISDS.\n\nAn alternative way ahead may be the preservation of investor protection under public international law, including ISDS, but with more concern for transparency and the balancing of economic and non-economic interests. As noted above, the European Commission proposed September 2015) an 'Investment Court System' to replace ISDS clauses (notably in the draft TTIP), with the scope for investor challenge much reduced and with 'highly skilled judges' rather than arbitrators used to determine cases.\n\nIn this vein, Karel De Gucht, the EU commissioner in charge of negotiating International Investment Agreements declared on 18 December 2014 that future agreements shall become more transparent, shall \"fully enshrine democratic prerogatives\" and \"explicitly state that legitimate government public policy decisions – on issues such as the balance between public and private provision of healthcare or \"the European ban on chicken carcasses washed with chlorine\" – cannot be over-ridden\". He announced to \"crack down on companies using legal technicalities to build frivolous cases against governments\", to \"open up investment tribunals to public scrutiny – documents will be public and interested parties, including NGOs, will be able to make submissions\". Also, he said, the EU \"will eliminate any conflicts of interest – the arbitrators who decide on EU cases must be above suspicion\". However, insisting equally on the advantages of such investment protection agreements, he states along that [they] \"protect job-creating investment from discrimination and unfair treatment\" and that \"the task here is to find the right balance between preventing abuse and protecting investments\".\n\nCurrent controversies over ISDS appear driven by attempts to expand its scope to new countries and, especially, to relations between developed countries with mature court systems and democratic governments.\n\nIn 2014, several members of the United States House of Representatives expressed opposition to inclusion of ISDS in the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union. In 2015, faced with opposition to ISDS in several European countries, the European Parliament adopted a resolution requiring any new dispute settlement scheme included in TTIP \"must be replaced by a new public and transparent system of investment protection, in which private interests cannot undermine public policy and which is subject to public law\". (The Commission's 2015 proposal in response is noted above).\n\nSouth Africa has stated it will withdraw from treaties with ISDS clauses, and India is also considering such a position. Indonesia plans to let treaties with ISDS clauses lapse when they need renewal. Brazil has refused any treaty with ISDS clauses.\n\nIn 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that \"The arbitration clause in the Agreement between the Netherlands and Slovakia on the protection of investments is not compatible with EU law\". This ruling could imply that any similar arbitration tribunal considering corporate sovereignty cases would also be illegal under EU law.\n\n\n"}

Samuel-Louis Crommelin, called Louis, was in business flax-spinning and linen-weaving. The family was Protestant, and the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 hit hard even though Louis was a Catholic convert of 1683. With his son and two daughters he made his way to Amsterdam. There he became partner in a bank, and was joined by his brothers Samuel and William.\n\nUnder William III and Mary II, Thomas Southwell had access to funds to develop Irish industry. Huguenot linen-workers had been encouraged to settle at Lisburn where already there was some manufacture of linen. In 1696 the English parliament passed an act admitting all products of hemp and flax duty free from Ireland to England; the Irish parliament in November 1697 passed an act for fostering the linen manufacture. William III's policy was to discourage the Irish woollen trade, but to build up linen manufacture there. Crommelin was the most prominent Huguenot attracted by Southwell. He arrived at Lisburn in the autumn of 1698, and made recommendations for improving the linen industry in a memorial of 16 April 1699; which were implemented quickly. Crommelin was made \"overseer of the royal linen manufacture of Ireland\", and lent money for the scheme. In 1702 Queen Anne confirmed its royal patent.\n\nCrommelin began by ordering looms from Flanders and Holland, and Huguenot weavers were introduced. He adopted Irish spinning-wheel but worked to improve it. His maker of the reeds, which control the warp threads, was Henry Mark du Pré (d. 1750), of Cambrai.\n\nBaron Conway gave a site for weaving workshops, and Irish apprentices were taken on. Dutchmen were engaged to teach flax-growing to farmers, and to superintend bleaching operations. It is not without some reason that Crommelin has been credited with originating, as regards Ulster, a system of technical education for the textile art. Crommelin was assisted by his brothers, and the linens and cambrics could replace imported textiles. In 1705 a factory was opened at Kilkenny, under the management of William Crommelin.\n\nCrommelin expanded operations, with the manufacture of hempen sailcloth at Rathkeale and other locations. He was given a pension in 1716, and died at Lisburn on 14 July 1727, aged 75. He was buried, with other Huguenots, in the eastern corner of the graveyard of Lisburn Cathedral.\n\nThe wife of Louis Crommelin was named Ann. She survived her husband by twenty-eight years, dying August 17, 1755, at the age of 97. Their only son, Louis, born at St Quentin, died at Lisburn on 1 July 1711, aged 28. Their daughter, Mary Madelien, who married Captain de Bernière, died 8 July 1715, aged 21. All four are buried in the family vault in the churchyard of Christ Church Cathedral, Lisburn.\n\nThe Crommelin family became extinct in the main line, but the name survived in a branch of the family of de la Cherois, connections by marriage.\n\n"}

In 1977, he and his younger brother, David Merage, founded their own company called Chef America Inc., mortgaging their homes and borrowing money from their parents. Chef America started by selling frozen Belgian waffles - then unfamiliar in the United States - to restaurants as they were difficult to cook. In 1977, the company had $12 million in sales and was the largest company in the world mass-producing frozen Belgian waffles. In 1983, noticing that more women were entering the workforce, he personally developed Hot Pockets, a frozen food that was microwaveable and easy to eat. The product was a resounding success and they expanded the brand to Lean Pockets and Croissant Pockets. In October 2002, he sold Chef America to Nestle SA for $2.6 billion; at the time, the company had sales of $750 million and 1,800 employees. After the sale, he founded MIG Capital LLC (formerly Falcon Investment Group LLC) which managed over $1 billion in assets.\n\nIn 2011, his net worth was estimated at $5 billion.\n\nIn 2005, Merage donated $30 million to the School of Business at UC Irvine, which was renamed the Paul Merage School of Business in his honor. Merage also donated $3 million to the Merage Jewish Community Center of Orange County, California. He is a board member and a leading donor for the Pacific Symphony and sits on the board of the Orange County Performing Arts Center.

He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\nRicketts is the son of Joe Ricketts, founder of TD Ameritrade. He worked for the company from 1993 to 2016, with a brief hiatus during an unsuccessful run for a United States Senate seat. In 2006, he reported his net worth as between $45million and $50million. Ricketts is also a part-owner – along with other family members – of Major League Baseball's Chicago Cubs.\n\nIn 2006, Ricketts ran against incumbent Nebraska U.S. Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat. He won the Republican primary election, but lost the general election, with 36% of the vote to Nelson's 64%. Ricketts ran for the Nebraska governorship in 2014. He narrowly won a six-way Republican primary, then won the general election with 57.1% of the vote to Democratic Party nominee Chuck Hassebrook's 39.2%. In June 2017, he stated that he would run for re-election in 2018.\n\nRicketts was born in Nebraska City on August 19, 1964, the oldest of four children of Joe and Marlene (Volkmer) Ricketts. Joe Ricketts was a businessman; Marlene, a teacher. The family moved to Omaha, where in 1975 Joe founded First Omaha Securities, one of the first discount brokerages in the United States. The company prospered, changing its name to Ameritrade, going public in 1997, and changing its name to TD Ameritrade after acquiring TD Waterhouse in 2006.\n\nRicketts and his siblings, Tom, Laura, and Todd, all attended Westside High School in Omaha, from which Ricketts graduated in 1982. He attended the University of Chicago, receiving a BA in biology in 1986 and an MBA in marketing and finance in 1991.\n\nAfter completing graduate school, Ricketts returned to Omaha. He worked for the Union Pacific Railroad for a year, then as a salesman for a Chicago environmental consultant. In 1993, he went to work for his father's business, initially in the call center, and subsequently holding a number of executive positions, ultimately becoming the company's chief operating officer. In a 2006 report, he stated that his net worth was between $45million and $50million.\n\nIn 1997, Ricketts married Susanne Shore. A native of Garden City, Kansas, Shore had grown up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and earned a bachelor's degree in English and then an MBA from Oklahoma State University. After a stint working for the dean of students at the University of South Dakota, she had come to Omaha in order to complete a one-year course in nursing at Creighton University. At the time of her marriage to Ricketts, she was working as a nurse at St. Joseph's Hospital in Omaha. Ricketts and Shore produced three children: Roscoe, Margot, and Eleanor.\n\nRicketts left Ameritrade in order to run for the U.S. Senate in 2006. After his defeat by incumbent Ben Nelson, he returned to the company's board, remaining until the Ricketts family relinquished its board seats in 2016.\n\nIn 2007, Ricketts co-founded, and became director and president of the Platte Institute for Economic Research, which he described as a \"free market think tank\", and which Nebraska newspapers have described as \"conservative\". He resigned from the organization in 2013 in order to concentrate on his 2014 gubernatorial campaign. From 2007 to 2012, Ricketts was a national committeeman for the Republican National Committee; from 2007 to 2013, he was a trustee of the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nIn 2009, the Ricketts family trust bought the Chicago Cubs baseball team from the Tribune Company. Ricketts and his siblings occupied four of the five seats on the team's board of directors; as of 2018, the four continued to hold those seats. Due to this, Ricketts has a 2016 World Series title to his credit, as the Cubs won the championship that year (fulfilling a pledge he had made in 2009 during the press conference to announce the family's purchase of the team, when he and his brother Tom guaranteed a World Series win for the Cubs under their ownership).\n\nRicketts is a Roman Catholic. He is a member of the Knights of Columbus and a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nRicketts was the 2006 Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat held and retained by Democrat Ben Nelson. His opponents in the primary were former Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg and former state Republican chairman David Kramer. Ricketts spent nearly $5 million of his own money out-of-pocket, outspending his opponents 10–1 in winning the nomination.\n\nRicketts received some high-profile campaign assistance, most notably from President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Bush appeared at a campaign rally for Ricketts on November 5, 2006, just days before the election, in Grand Island, Nebraska.\n\nRicketts ran on a conservative platform, emphasizing fiscal responsibility, immigration reform, and agriculture, as well as championing a socially conservative platform opposing same-sex marriage and abortion. In all, he contributed $11,302,078 of his own money to his campaign, triggering the Millionaire's Amendment which allowed his opponent to raise larger amounts from each donor. He spent more money than any Senate candidate in Nebraska history, but was defeated by Nelson by a margin of 36%–64%.\n\nIn the 2014 election, Ricketts ran for the Nebraska governorship. The incumbent, Dave Heineman, was barred by Nebraska's term-limits law from running for re-election. Two candidates considered strong contenders for the Republican nomination withdrew by early 2013: lieutenant governor Rick Sheehy, who was embroiled in a scandal; and Speaker of the Legislature Mike Flood, whose wife had been diagnosed with cancer. Ricketts officially joined the race in September 2013, at which point he and state auditor Mike Foley were regarded as early front-runners in a race that also included state senators Charlie Janssen, Beau McCoy, and Tom Carlson. In February 2014, Janssen withdrew, and state attorney general Jon Bruning declared his candidacy. Despite his late entrance, Bruning supplanted Ricketts as the perceived front-runner.\n\nWhen the primary election was held in May 2014, Ricketts led the field of six candidates, with 26.6% of the vote to Bruning's 25.5%. McCoy received 20.9%; Foley, 19.2%; Carlson, 4.1%; and Omaha attorney Bryan Slone, 3.7%.\n\nIn the general election, Ricketts faced Chuck Hassebrook, who had run unopposed for the Democratic Party's nomination. Hassebrook was a former member of the University of Nebraska Board of Regents, and former director of the Center for Rural Affairs, which describes itself as \"a leading nonprofit organization with a national reputation for progressive rural advocacy and policy work\". Ricketts advocated tax reductions; Hassebrook argued that Ricketts's proposed cuts would primarily benefit the rich, and would deprive the state of funds for what he characterized as needed public services. Ricketts opposed the proposed expansion of Medicaid under the provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Hassebrook favored the expansion. Ricketts expressed opposition to an increase in the state's minimum wage; Hassebrook supported it.\n\nOver the course of the general-election campaign, Ricketts outspent Hassebrook by a considerable margin. In the last spending report filed before the election, he stated that he had loaned his campaign $930,000, and that the organization had spent about $6.0 million. Hassebrook reported expenditures of slightly more than $2.5 million.\n\nIn the general election, Ricketts received 57.1% of the vote to Hassebrook's 39.2%. Libertarian Mark G. Elworth Jr. received 3.5%, and write-in votes accounted for 0.1%.\n\nRicketts was inaugurated as the 40th governor of Nebraska at the Nebraska State Capitol on January 8, 2015.\n\nAmong the \"most significant\" actions taken by the Legislature in its 2015 session were three bills that passed over Ricketts's veto. LB268 repealed the state's death penalty; LB623 reversed the state's previous policy of denying driver's licenses to people who were living illegally in the United States after being brought to the country as children, and who had been granted exemption from deportation under the Barack Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program; and LB610 increased the tax on gasoline to pay for repairs to roads and bridges.\n\nFollowing the override of Ricketts's veto of the death-penalty repeal, capital-punishment proponents launched a petition drive to reverse the legislature's action. Their efforts gathered enough signatures to suspend the repeal until a public vote could be held. Capital-punishment opponents then filed a lawsuit arguing that the petition should be invalidated, on the grounds that Ricketts, who had contributed $200,000 to the campaign, was \"the primary initiating force\" for the petition drive, and should have been included in the list of sponsors required by Nebraska law. In February 2016, a Lancaster County district judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that Ricketts's financial support of the petition effort did not, ipso facto, make him a sponsor.\nThe plaintiffs appealed the issue to the Nebraska Supreme Court. The referendum was held in the general election of 2016; 61.2% of the population voted in favor of keeping the death penalty.\n\nIn its 2016 session, the legislature passed three bills that Ricketts then vetoed. LB580 would have created an independent commission of citizens to draw new district maps following censuses; supporters described it as an attempt to de-politicize the redistricting process, while Ricketts maintained that the bill delegated the legislature's constitutional duty of redistricting to \"an unelected and unaccountable board\". The bill's sponsor, John Murante, opted not to seek an override of the veto. A second vetoed bill, LB935, would have changed state audit procedures; it passed by a margin of 37–8, with 4 present and not voting. The bill was withdrawn without an attempt to override the veto; the state auditor agreed to work with the governor on a new version for the next year's session. A third bill, LB947, made DACA beneficiaries eligible for commercial and professional licenses in Nebraska. The bill passed the Legislature on a vote of 33–11–5; the veto override passed 31–13–5.\n\nAt the 2016 Republican state convention, Ricketts denounced several legislators who had failed to support his and the party's positions on various bills, and called for the election of more \"platform Republicans\" to the officially nonpartisan legislature. In response to this, thirteen legislators, including five registered Republicans, released a statement in which they accused Ricketts of placing partisanship above principle. One of the signers of the statement, Laura Ebke, changed her registration from Republican to Libertarian shortly thereafter, citing Ricketts's speech as one of the factors that drove her to make the change.\n\nOn June 5, 2017, Ricketts announced his re-election bid for the 2018 election. During his speech, he stated that \"lowering property taxes\" will be his main concern if he is elected to a second-term. Ricketts also asked Nebraskans to \"re-hire\" current Lt. Governor Mike Foley.\n\nRicketts voiced his support for the Keystone XL Pipeline, as he stated it would \"create jobs here in Nebraska, lots of tax revenues here in Nebraska, of course help us become less dependent on foreign oil.\"\n\nRicketts is a supporter of the death penalty.\n\n"}

Three main catalysts are employed commercially: the Phillips catalyst, Ziegler-Natta catalysts (based on titanium trichloride), and, for specialty polymers, metallocene-based catalysts.\n\nThe Phillips catalyst is prepared by impregnating high surface area silica gel with chromium trioxide or related chromium compounds. The solid precatalyst is then calcined in air to give the active catalyst. Only a fraction of the chromium is catalytically active, a fact that interferes with elucidation of the catalytic mechanism. The active catalyst is often depicted as a chromate ester bound to the silica surface. The mechanism for the polymerization process is the subject of much research, the central question being the structure of the active species, which is assumed to be an organochromium compound. Robert L. Banks and J. Paul Hogan, both at Phillips Petroleum, filed the first patents on the Phillips catalyst in 1953. Four years later, the process was commercialized.\n"}
{"id": "40435919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40435919", "title": "Proactive contracting", "text": "Proactive contracting\n\nProactive Contracting is akin to Proactive Law and focuses on the same properties, namely to prevent problems and promote relationships. The legal area of research developed in Scandinavia in the 1990s and has gradually gained attention. Proactive Contracting deals with Contract Management, Relational Management, Risk Management and Business Process Management.\n\nThe word proactive is the opposition to reactive and refers to acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes.\n\nA survey conducted by IACCM shows that businesses urge a paradigm shift in contracting, favoring a more relational approach. Thus, the focus of future contracting becomes more relational. Businesses may therefore face increased complexity as trading is done not only across physical boundaries, but also across religious, cultural, and ethical boundaries.\n\nThe IACCM survey has underpinned the need for re-thinking contracts and the approach to business relationships, as international, and long relationships, make it hard to draft and agree upon every single event that might occur in the future.\n\nProactive Contracting is moving away from the path of responding to these complex relationships with complex contracts. However, as it is hard to imagine realistic alternatives to contracts, Proactive Contracting suggest businesses to change perception of contracts to meet the needs of the future. Add to this the increased complexity of products due to technological evolution and it becomes clear that businesses need to actively deal with the danger of increasing complexity and uncertainty.\nIn fact, a survey conducted by IBM Corporation revealed that 79% of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) see increased global complexity as a major challenge over the coming years.\n\nAs the legal framework increases in complexity, it becomes apparent that there is a need for creating certainty in order to support future trading.\nBusinesses need to manage this complexity in order to avoid unnecessary losses, but also in order to exploit all the possibilities deriving from global interaction.\n\nEmpirical studies on contracting capabilities and research on dynamic capabilities have shown that promoting proactive behavior in businesses is a key in the quest of future success.\nAs globalization increases, sustainability and certainty become more urgent, resulting in decentralization of the traditional legal environment. The reason for this decentralization is that the traditional legal environment does not fulfill the task of creating the certainty and sustainability that businesses need in order to prosper.\n\nAfter the launch of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, mechanisms have evolved through which future development is achieved. According to these mechanisms, a sound development must be focusing on ethically acceptable, morally fair and economically sound processes.\nManagement tools for global value chains have already been developed, and focus is especially on self- and private regulation instruments and standards - this is where proactive contracting and proactive law is coming to the fore.\n\nThe proactive law movement has become more visible in recent years, but the idea of an ex ante view is not new. It is generally known that the earlier a dispute or a potential dispute is addressed, the better the chances of a fair and prompt solution. Louis M. Brown was the first to introduce the ex ante view in his ground-laying book “Preventive Law” Although he identified and organized the preventive law into a distinctive way of thinking, he was not the inventor of this approach. It has been, and still is, well known to many legal professionals and every business manager that:\n\n\"It usually costs less to avoid getting into trouble than to pay for getting out of trouble.\"\n\nIn order to understand the general principles of proactive law, Edward E. Dauer has identified the core principles of preventive law, as these principles create the foundation on which proactive law and proactive contracting is built. The four core principles of preventive law are:\n\n\nThe proactive law movement encompasses the basic principles of preventive law stated by Edward E. Dauer, namely preventing what is not desirable, and keeping problems and risks from materializing. Thus, preventive law constitute the foundation of proactive law.\nTo this preventive dimension of law, proactive law adds a second aspect, which is often neglected in traditional law – known as the promotive dimension.\n\nThe nature of the promotive dimension is positive and promotes what is desirable while encouraging good behavior. This is the distinction to preventive law.\n\nIn a legal context, proactive law emphasizes the importance of collaboration between legal professionals and other disciplines, in order to achieve the desired goals in circumstances where legal expertise works in collaboration with other professionals involved. In proactive law the need for dialogue between different understandings is thus emphasized. In a medical context the preventive law prevents ill health, while proactive law promotes well-being.\n\nThe proactive law approach is based on legal certainty, literacy and cross-professional collaboration in order to “localize the mines and preventing them from exploding.”\n\nBusinesses need to manage their compliance with the law and align it to business objectives. In order to do this, not only lawyers, in-house counsels and regulators need to know the law, but also managers and other stakeholders need to have basic knowledge and understanding of the legal \"mines\". When the business have the capability of navigating past the \"mines\" through legal literacy and awareness, it has used the law in a proactive manner that in the end may constitute a source of competitive advantage.\n\nContracts and contracting processes are complex and often involve cross-professional collaboration. The different stakeholders to a contract each represent their respective area of responsibility, e.g. technical, financial, legal area, etc. A successfully executed contract is thus dependent on the stakeholder’s ability to communicate and collaborate.\nIn order to promote successful contracting, the stakeholders to a contract thus need mutual understanding in order to collaborate efficiently.\n\nThe quest is thus to go from theoretically to practically applicable solutions, in order to obtain a competitive advantage. One big leap in this process is recognition of the benefits that proactive law brings into contracting.\n\nIt all starts with the managers. If they are not confident that the proactive approach is beneficial, then the implementation has no foundation. It is crucial that the managers are convinced that this new approach maximizes the business opportunities while minimizing the risk. Just as important, the managers need tools in order to be able to see that implementation of the proactive approach in business processes is within reach.\n\nIn order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage through proactive contracting, there is a strong consensus that the following points need to be integrated in the business overall strategy and business processes. When the manager knows about the following contracting elements, she/he has the prerequisite to take an informed decision about going the proactive way.\n\nIt is obvious that the earlier a potential dispute is addressed, the better the chance of a prompt and fair solution. However, even the most proactive manager may face difficulties in ADR as a dispute involves at least two parties, and their mutual willingness to follow the proactive approach.\n\nThis implies that even in situations where the parties have applied the best thinkable proactive approach to their contract, not all disputes can be avoided. If the parties lack common understanding of what they have agreed upon, this will trigger disputes.\n\nThe proactive law approach to contracting tells us that the essential thing is to anticipate human behavior, thus being prepared to take control of situations that the parties in their agreement did not predict.\n\nThe parties should take control of contingencies by considering the best method to resolve a dispute.\nThe aim in ADR is to avoid unnecessary escalation of problems, as value is protected through proper dispute resolution.\nThe most successful approach in solving disputes is based on \"preventing\" them from occurring by \"promoting\" a mutually healthy relationship.\n\nBy handling problems early, businesses might prevent time consuming resolutions from evolving and thereby save costs and promote value. This requires proper understanding of the mutual goals of the relationship through disclosure of procedures that aim at identifying possible sources of disagreements before they arise.\nTherefore, a clear dispute resolution policy provides an important strategic advantage in identifying the source of disagreement and deals with them before they develop into severe disputes. Besides avoiding costs from occurring, an ADR strategy limits the time spent by management on litigation. Thus, the costly disruption of litigation and the opportunity cost are limited.\n\nBesides preventing escalation of the dispute, the parties are able to anticipate the next step of the resolution process, as the procedure has been contractually agreed.\nThe parties’ incentives to incorporate an ADR clause in their contract is both economically, but also legally grounded. The optimal resolution for the parties is not reached through traditional litigation, by referring to their rights and obligations.\nInstead the parties should be more proactive and find a solution that is in the best interest of both parties in order to minimize losses derived from their disagreement. This enhances the chances that their relationship will continue in the future.\nA recent survey shows that the most favored ADR in international contracts is, arbitration. Arbitration is considered the last resort in the escalation, along with court litigation. This indeed shows that businesses miss the opportunities provided by avoiding immediate escalation.\n\nThe proactive approach to law suggests that contracts are more than just a legal insurance policy that handles the case that one party does not perform. Contracts should be considered as a management tool that visualizes the goals to reach and how to reach them. Thus, it is not enough that the legal department and the in-house counsels read and understand the business’ contracts, and furthermore these legal professionals should not craft contracts alone as contractual literacy is required by every user of the contract.\n\nOne of these processes concerns the issue of making all the business’ contracts accessible and easily understandable to all the users. The quest is thus to change the way contracts are communicated, perceived and taught.\nA promising new direction for contracting practice is developing though the use of non-textual communication, which deals with visualization of legal information combined with strategy visualization. In order to facilitate a meeting of the parties' mind, visual techniques is considered a proactive contracting-resource.\nThe idea of using visuals in contracting processes has evolved in Europe and especially Germany. This field of research is also known as - \"Rechtsvisualisierung\".\n\nA survey conducted by IACCM suggests that the majority of businesses expect that there will be greater use of visual techniques in contracting, and that visualization will play a main role in achieving better and more successful contracts in the coming years.\n\nIn general, visualization is understood as a graphic presentation that depicts information in a way that is conductive to acquiring insight, developing and elaborating understanding, or communicating experience.\nIn this context, the idea of visualization is to communicate through visual legal tools in order to convey information in a way that makes it easily understandable by the users of the contract. The need for visual communication is reflected in the growing use of visual tools in businesses to explain legal concepts in legal education.\nHowever, most contracts still lack visualization, and instead use text in black and white. Businesses that take this traditional approach face huge opportunities for improvements.\nThe research field of visual contracts is quite new, and lack solutions.\n\nIn addition to visual contracts, managers need to avoid focusing on single objectives. Instead emphasis should be on the duration of their customer relationship, the innovation that have resulted from their interactions, and the referral business that can be traced to those customers. As stated by George J. Siedel: “Rather than focusing on whether they achieved price discounts, purchasers should emphasize a full cost approach that considers matters such as the operating efficiencies gained through using the supplier, the reductions in defects achieved by the supplier, and even the supplier’s role in developing products or service innovations.”\n\nBy \"going to the balcony\" - symbolizing the holistic view - managers become proactive as they view contracts in a big picture perspective. The focus on contracts is thus changed from a \"legal tool\" to the broader view of contracts as a \"management tool\". Managers, who want to become proactive, need to challenge the conventional wisdom that contracts are legal documents and instead adopting a view of contracts as a source of innovation through collaboration.\n\nThe fundamental components that managers need to adapt into contracting processes, in order to become proactive, are centralized around leadership. Proactive leadership facilitates the environment needed for supporting an organization that enables high performance and good behavior that encourages collaborative contracting. \"The balcony view\" provides managers with a holistic mindset that facilitates the foundation for proactive leadership.\nWith this revised focus, the parties can attempt to establish procedures for more open information flows and greater transparency in order to signalize their intentions to collaborate and work together to manage risks and optimize results.\nThus, contracts are no longer a necessary evil, but rather an instrument that, when handled proactively, facilitates a competitive advantage.\n\nAs trading becomes more relational, the traditional role of contracts is changing, favoring the informality of traditional sales and business development. However, this seems somewhat unlikely considering the pressure for regulatory compliance on the one hand, and the demand for better management of risk and delivery of financial return on the other hand. This leads to an overwhelming view that the result of growing complexity will be a different form of contract, adjusted to the needs of the market. Ways that this will be achieved include a growth in industry standards and in some cases increased use of private law. There will also be a continued drive towards international standards that enable agreement through reference, rather than requiring case-by-case negotiation. This view is also reflected by an IACCM survey, which shows that businesses expect international standard terms in contracting to prevail in the future. A response to this anticipated change in contracting could be based on the CISG.\nIt is shown how the CISG can fulfill the need of standard terms in international contracting, in accordance with the proactive philosophy.\n\nSince Ronald Coase in 1960 stated that when moving from an economic regime supposing zero transaction costs to an economic regime of positive transaction costs, the legal system becomes crucially important.\n\nThe insight of the Coase theorem is in short that if transaction costs are higher than the gains from trade, then the initial assignment of property rights determines how resources are ultimately allocated.\n\nIn the slipstream of the Coase theorem, professionals increasingly focused on understanding the roles of transaction costs and the legal system in the economy. In particular, the focus was on institutions that could enable a reduction of transaction costs called New Institutional Economics.\n\nA great deal of the research has been based on the assumption that economic growth is reflected in the ease of doing business. Accordingly, a key recommendation is to develop institutions that reduce transaction costs and facilitate trade.\n\nIn the traditional legal framework, some managers derogate from or opt out of the CISG. In general, this is not in accordance with the mutual economic incentives that derive through the use of the CISG. Instead the proactive manager bears in mind the CISG benefits on macro level, and recognizes this as an opportunity to limit transaction costs on a micro level between businesses.\nThe proactive characteristics support the use of tools that enable a maximization of the value in each business relationship. Thus, the CISG is truly a proactive tool that should be seen as kind of an agreed document between the contracting parties on sales of goods. This implies that rights and obligations to a large extent are subject to CISG regulation.\n\nBy using the CISG as an agreed document, the parties’ rights and obligations are distributed in a fair and balanced way that is widely recognized as promoting international trade.\n\nOf course the CISG does not fit completely to specific transactions, thus the parties need to negotiate provisions that are dealing with the transaction, e.g. delivery, payment, price, ADR, etc. In addition to \"transactional terms\", the parties need to negotiate a limitation of liability, as the CISG does not govern this issue. Further, there is a need to emphasize that the use of the CISG in commodity sales is often not suitable because of string trading and the lack of strict avoidance provisions in the CISG.\n\nHowever, with these constraints, the proactive manager should emphasize the CISG as an agreed document, as the default rules roughly reflect the same result, which the parties would have bargained. This implies that the parties reach agreement in less time and with less effort, in accordance with the proactive philosophy.\nThe use of and need for international legal standard terms will increase in the future, and as a response to this need, the CISG provides a framework that can easily be adopted into contracting.\n\nAnother fact that speaks pro the use of Proactive Contracting, is decisions of the German Supreme Court in cases on interpretation of the CISG. It seems that even in transactions leading to dispute, judgments seem to favor the most economic solution, supporting economic cost considerations and bargaining-for-risk theories.\n\nTo transform the traditional legal approach to contracting into a proactive approach to contracting, businesses must strive to maximize the value of their business relationships through a change in mindset towards relational contracting. This view is no longer disputed as IACCM has valid measuring showing this fact.\n\nThe paradigm shift that businesses urge, which IACCM has identified, must be supported by an ex ante view on contracting that emphasizes the need for preventing problems from materializing, when possible, and resolving unavoidable disputes early using the most appropriate methods.\nFurther, businesses are encouraged to promote procedures that can help identify opportunities before they pass in order to maximize value, strengthen business relationships and manage risk. Managing the desired goals and securing the most appropriate mix of means to achieve them require early involvement of stakeholders, alignment of objectives, creation of a shared vision, and development of support and guidance for successful implementation.\nBy adopting a proactive view on contracting, businesses may be able to turn the view on future contracting from uncertain threat into a proactive resource of value.\n"}

Such resources may include financial resources, inventory, human skills, production resources, or information technology (IT).\n\nIn the realm of project management, processes, techniques and philosophies as to the best approach for allocating resources have been developed. These include discussions on functional vs. cross-functional resource allocation as well as processes espoused by organizations like the Project Management Institute (PMI) through their Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) methodology of project management. Resource management is a key element to activity resource estimating and project human resource management. Both are essential components of a comprehensive project management plan to execute and monitor a project successfully. As is the case with the larger discipline of project management, there are resource management software tools available that automate and assist the process of resource allocation to projects and portfolio resource transparency including supply and demand of resources. The goal of these tools typically is to ensure that: (i) there are employees within our organization with required specific skill set and desired profile required for a project, (ii) decide the number and skill sets of new employees to hire, and (iii) allocate the workforce to various projects. Within professional services and consulting organizations, the effectiveness of these tools and processes is typically monitored by measuring billable utilization rate.\n\nLarge organizations usually have a defined corporate resource management process which mainly guarantees that resources are never over-allocated across multiple projects. Peter Drucker wrote of the need to focus resources, abandoning a less promising initiatives for every new project taken on, as fragmentation inhibits results. \n\nOne resource management technique is resource leveling. It aims at smoothing the stock of resources on hand, reducing both excess inventories and shortages.\n\nThe required data are: the demands for various resources, forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable, as well as the resources' configurations required in those demands, and the supply of the resources, again forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable.\n\nThe goal is to achieve 100% utilization but that is very unlikely, when weighted by important metrics and subject to constraints, for example: meeting a minimum service level, but otherwise minimizing cost. A Project Resource Allocation Matrix (PRAM) is maintained to visualize the resource allocations against various projects.\n\nThe principle is to invest in resources as stored capabilities, then unleash the capabilities as demanded.\n\nA dimension of resource development is included in resource management by which investment in resources can be retained by a smaller additional investment to develop a new capability that is demanded, at a lower investment than disposing of the current resource and replacing it with another that has the demanded capability.\n\nIn conservation, resource management is a set of practices pertaining to maintaining natural systems integrity. Examples of this form of management are air resource management, soil conservation, forestry, wildlife management and water resource management. The broad term for this type of resource management is natural resource management (NRM).\n\nIn addition, we can use Ishikawa diagram to analyze Man, Money, Material and Machine needed. \n\n"}
{"id": "29965966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29965966", "title": "Revolo", "text": "Revolo\n\nRevolo is a plug-in parallel hybrid technology that can be retrofitted in both existing and new cars. This technology can also be used in buses and trucks. The technology was developed by KPIT Technologies and the product will be manufactured through a joint venture between Bharat Forge and KPIT. As part of the joint venture, KPIT will license the hybrid technology while Bharat Forge will provide manufacturing, assembly, and integration.\n\nPre-compliance tests conducted at the Automotive research Association of India (ARAI), Pune have confirmed that the technology provides fuel efficiency improvements by over 40 percent and reduction in green house gas (GHG) emissions by over 30%.\n\nThe technology is to be marketed to OEMs and individual vehicle owners through a network of dealerships.\n\nThe idea of Revolo first occurred to Tejas Kshatriya in 2008 when he was stuck in Mumbai traffic en route to Pune.\n\nKPIT sanctioned a team of four engineers for the project, which was kept separate from CREST, the research and development center at KPIT. It took 2 years of research and a budget under US$2 million to evolve the idea through trial and error and several failures, including the inability of the system to withstand sudden surge in power when brakes were applied.\n\nThe research and development team studied the firing pattern of internal combustion engines and identified the weak spots that lead to fuel waste and created a technology that can convert a passenger car to a hybrid that is environmentally friendly, cheap, fuel-efficient and at the same time offers good performance.\n\nRevolo is designed to work in typical stop-and-go city traffic and allows cars to cruise at about 30 km/h in the third gear without straining the engine.\n\nKPIT continues the road tests of pilot vehicles as well as consumer trials with results so far having validated the pre-announced performance results. The team has further reduced the overall weight of the solution, improved on the durability and standardized many components across multiple vehicle platforms. Construction at the assembly and manufacturing plants continues. It is expected to be operational by March 2014.\n\nThe company will test various vehicles, including passenger cars, with engines sizes between 800 cc and 2,500 cc.\n\nProduction of limited hybrid kits is planned to start by first half of 2012. The commercial production would begin in 2012-13.\n\nThe Revolo kit is similar to a retrofit compressed natural gas (CNG) kit which contains all required mechanical and electrical components in the package.\n\nThe kit can be installed in both petrol and diesel vehicles within 4–6 hours by trained technicians who will be trained by a joint venture that KPIT has formed with Bharat Forge.\n\nThe Revolo kit comprises a 7.5 to 10 horsepower electric motor developed and patented by KPIT, an electronic motor controller, lead–acid battery pack, mechanical assembly and coupling, proprietary software for control algorithms of the motor and batteries, and battery management system.\n\nAs a parallel hybrid the motor and engine will work simultaneously and as a plug-in, the vehicle can be charged through a standard external electricity source such as a domestic power outlet. Unlike an electric vehicle, the vehicle will operate as a conventional fuel vehicle even if the batteries are completely drained.\n\nThe conversion kit is a lot less complex and light in weight in context of the moving engine components which effectively enhances the fuel efficiency to twice as compared to existing solutions.\n\nBattery specifications: The solution is battery agnostic. It can be adopted to work with various types of batteries such as lead–acid batteries or Lithium-ion batteries. The solution typically produces 60 volts from five valve-regulated, lead–acid batteries, and can be recharged from the standard Indian household current of 230 volts in 4 to 6 hours.\n\nRevolo also consists of an in-built device that recognizes driving patterns and self-adjusts to provide optimum efficiency in stop-and-go traffic situations.\n\nRevolo is said to be 80 percent cheaper as compared to the after-market hybrid car kits available in the United States which cost around US$20,000. It can be retrofitted into any vehicle at an average cost of Rs. 100,000.\n\n"}
{"id": "951394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=951394", "title": "Rochdale Principles", "text": "Rochdale Principles\n\nThe Rochdale Principles are a set of ideals for the operation of cooperatives. They were first set out in 1844 by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in Rochdale, England and have formed the basis for the principles on which co-operatives around the world continue to operate. The implications of the Rochdale Principles are a focus of study in co-operative economics. The original Rochdale Principles were officially adopted by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) in 1937 as the Rochdale Principles of Co-operation. Updated versions of the principles were adopted by the ICA in 1966 as the Co-operative Principles and in 1995 as part of the Statement on the Co-operative Identity.\n\nThe Rochdale Principles, according to the 1995 ICA revision, can be summarised as follows.\n\nThe first of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have an open and voluntary membership. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, \"Co-operatives are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.\"\n\nTo discriminate socially is to make a distinction between people on the basis of class or category. Examples of social discrimination include racial, religious, sexual, sexual orientation, disability, and ethnic discrimination. To fulfil the first Rochdale Principle, a Co-operative society should not prevent anyone willing to participate from doing so on any of these grounds. However, this does not prohibit the co-operative from setting reasonable and relevant ground rules for membership, such as residing in a specific geographic area or paying a membership fee to join, so long as all persons meeting such criteria are able to participate if they so choose.\n\nGiven the voluntary nature of co-operatives, members need reasons to participate. Each person's motivations will be unique and will vary from one co-operative to another, but they will often be a combination of the following:\n\nThe second of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have democratic member control. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.”\n\nMember economic participation is one of the defining features of co-operative societies, and constitutes the third Rochdale Principle in the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity. According to the ICA, co-operatives are enterprises in which “Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.” This principle, in turn, can be broken down into a number of constituent parts.\n\nThe first part of this principle states that “Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative.” This enshrines democratic control over the co-operative, and how its capital is used.\n\nThe second part of the principle deals with how members are compensated for funds invested in a Co-operative, and how surpluses should be used. Unlike for-profit corporations, co-operatives are a form of social enterprise. Given this, there are at least three purposes for which surplus funds can be used, or distributed, by a Co-operative.\n\nThe fourth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must be autonomous and independent. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.”\n\nThe fifth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must provide education and training to their members and the public. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the general public – particularly young people and opinion leaders – about the nature and benefits of co-operation.”\n\nThe sixth of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operatives cooperate with each other. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.”\n\nThe seventh of the Rochdale Principles states that co-operative societies must have concern for their communities. According to the ICA's Statement on the Co-operative Identity, “Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.”\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle for lay audience, tracing the early history of the Rochdale Pioneers and the Rochdale Principles.\n"}

Constructed in 1924 as the headquarters for the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway and the Southwest's largest merchandising center, three of the original four buildings remain today and have been renovated into various uses. Santa Fe Buildings No. 1 and No. 2 were listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997, and the buildings are Dallas Landmarks. The Santa Fe Freight Terminal is regarded as one of the chief factors in the development of Dallas commercially.\n\nThe site chosen for the terminal complex was already owned by the railroad and served by tracks connecting with the East Dallas GC&SF yard. The original Santa Fe station in Dallas was built on the site in 1884 and replaced by the 1896 Richardsonian Romanesque passenger station. The latter was one of six depots belonging to different railroads which became redundant with the completion of Union Station in 1916. The depot was razed and a vast, 100,000 cubic yard excavation done with the equivalent of a box car load of dynamite.\n\nProject architect Lloyd R. Whitson, working with engineers and railroad planners from the AT&SF, planned the complex so that four buildings, in a line running north to south from Commerce to Young Streets, could be served by up to three sets of underground railroad tracks branching from a central subsurface line, which emerged from the underground farther south near the present Dallas Convention Center.\n\nThe complex was constructed in 1924-25 as one of the more ambitious Texas building projects of the 1920s and one of the Southwest's largest merchandising centers. All four buildings were linked by a subterranean rail tunnel served by small steam locomotives. Construction of the buildings and the underground freight house was a massive undertaking and work continued around the clock.\n\nBuilding No. 1, also known as the Santa Fe Office Building, was constructed as the main building at 1114 Commerce Street and opened in late 1924. It contained 20 floors of offices and included a restaurant and drug store, and was the most elaborately decorated building of the complex. The structure featured several setbacks and ornamental arches designed in the Mission Revival style topped by a barrel vaulted roof. The office building provided some of the most desirable office space in Dallas in the 1925-42 period, housing many national corporations and representatives of insurance companies. The rear of the building connected to a 10-story warehouse wing fronting Jackson Street and served as the terminus of the freight depot.\n\nBuilding No. 2, also known as the Garment Center, followed the same design as Building No. 1's warehouse. This structure was built as 10-story warehouses in light brown brick with large open industrial spaces and concrete columns. The building housed offices and showrooms for manufacturing companies, chemical companies, and building supplies. Near the end of construction, a 2-story structure was added on the roof of the building to serve as the clubhouse for the University Club, a major private men's club. A skybridge was erected to connect the member entrance on the eleventh floor of Santa Fe Building No. 1 with the clubhouse. The penthouse included an auditorium/great hall, library and dining room with bedrooms for resident members and nonresident members' guests on the second level. Trees, shrubs and a putting green surrounded the clubhouse. Plans were made to expand the club to the roofs of Buildings No. 1 and No. 3, but the club only used the penthouse until the late 1930s. Radio station WFAA moved into and converted the former University Club space for a broadcast station in 1940.\n\nBuilding No. 3 and Building No.  4 were similar in design to the other warehouses, with each being 8 stories in height and connected to the rail tunnel. Building No. 3, also known as the Ingram Freezer Building, was designed for cold storage.\n\nThirty-five to forty rail cars entered the tunnel each day, pulled by a \"hot water bottle\" locomotive. It was specially designed to prevent smoke in the main line and its six spurs in the tunnels by being charged with steam, which would last from four to five hours from a central, high pressure boiler under the office building. A 1924 Santa Fe Magazine article called the engine a \"unique feature in locomotive construction, only one other of its type being in existence.\" They remained in service until about 1950, when diesel locomotives assumed the duty. Rail cars carried goods into the buildings and then the 21 freight elevators lifted merchandise to upper-level showrooms and first-floor trucking platforms.\n\nIn 1942 the United States Government acquired Building No. 1 by eminent domain, converting portions of the building to serve as headquarters for the U.S. Army 8th Service Command as well as an enlistment center. Thousands of draftees, after reporting to the enlistment center in Building No. 1, proceeded to platforms beneath the buildings where they boarded trains bound for training centers. Informal sources suggest the building has among the strongest associations with the war effort of any building in North Texas.\n\nAfter the government's acquisition of the complex, the warehouse buildings passed into various ownership. Construction of the nearby Dallas Convention Center severed the link to the main rail lines, and over time the warehouses became vacant. Santa Fe Building No. 3 was demolished in 1988 and replaced with a large parking lot. Santa Fe Buildings No. 1 and No. 2 were listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 and renovated over the years, although the isolated No. 4 building remained abandoned for many years.\n\nSanta Fe Building No. 1 still houses offices for the federal government, with additional space in the adjacent Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse. Santa Fe Building No. 2 was redeveloped into SoCo Urban lofts. Santa Fe Building No. 4, at the complex's southernmost point, reopened in 2009 as the downtown Dallas Aloft Hotel. Remnants of the tunnels still remain in the buildings today.\n\n\n"}
