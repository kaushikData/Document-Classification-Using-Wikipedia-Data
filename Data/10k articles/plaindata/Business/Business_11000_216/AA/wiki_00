It is an easy bike ride, walk or bus ride from Fremont Street. The name, \"18b,\" represents the original Arts District area, which consisted of 18 blocks. Today, the Arts District area has grown beyond those original 18 blocks and is a classic urban mix of residential, commercial and cultural uses that will continue to grow as the hub of the arts scene in Las Vegas.\n\nThe \"First Friday\" Art Walk is a monthly arts and cultural event drawing up to 30,000 visitors into the neighborhood on the first Friday evening of each month. This event encourages people to flock downtown to browse, buy, eat, drink and mingle. The event is a festival environment with food and beverage vendors, music, visual performances and artists/artisans/craftspeople displaying their works.\n\nThe district hosts a \"First Friday\" art walk on the first Friday of every month. First Friday offers an eclectic group of artists as well as \"entertainers of all types, including local bands, fire breathers, acrobats, break dancers, fortune tellers and performance artists.\"\n\nIn addition to \"First Friday\", Preview Thursday is held preceding night before the block party. It is a subdued night of gallery openings and special events around the arts district without the large crowds that the main event can bring.\n\nThe district is loosely bounded by Hoover Avenue, Wyoming Avenue, Las Vegas Boulevard, and Commerce Street. The official bounds are visible on the \"City of Las Vegas\" website.\n\n\n"}

He is known for producing \"Defence of Sevastopol\", Russia's first feature film, as well as Ladislas Starevich's ground-breaking stop motion animation. Khanzhonkov worked as a consultant in the post-revolutionary Goskino until he was banned from cinema in 1926.\n\nKhanzhonkov was born in the small village of Khanzhonkova of the Don Host Oblast (modern-day Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast) into a noble family of Don Cossacks. His father Alexei Petrovich Khanzhonkov was a landlord who went bankrupt. His mother Paraskeva Sergeevna Khanzhonkova (née Dmitrieva) came from a colonel's family who owned a Singer shop in Moscow. The noble title was first granted to Aleksandr's great-grandfather Vasily Khanzhonkov.\n\nAleksandr studied in the Novocherkassk Cossack School and was sent to serve in the Moscow host after his graduation in 1986. He took part in the Russo-Japanese War which undermined his health. In 1905, upon a discharge from military training due to health issues, Khanzhonkov sat in on a screening of Train Pulling into a Station by the Lumiere Brothers. This marked the onset of his interest and subsequent investment in film, primarily as a producer but also as a director.\n\nIn 1906 Khanzhonkov founded Russia's first cinema factory, A. Khanzhonkov and Co., whose main financial backer was Ivan Ozerov, an influential banker and member of the Russian State Council. Initial productions were shot on stage in the vein of Melies and were overshadowed by the work of Alexander Drankov. Known for his unabashed commercialism, Drankov would remain a competitor up to the revolution of 1917.\n\nIt wasn't until 1911 that Khanzhonkov's factory would receive widespread acclaim with the release of \"Defence of Sevastopol\". One of the earliest full length Russian feature films, it was equally notable for its technical aspects. By the end of 1912, Khanzhonkov had established a permanent studio in Moscow and went on to produce over a hundred films over the course of the next several years. Much of Khanzhonkov's work during this time period went \"virtually unseen by the Russian masses\" and often took aim at aristocratic sensibilities or adapted great Russian novels of the 19th century. Nonetheless, Khanzhonov helped create many standards in Russian cinema production; the first confirmed use of artificial light in the Russian film industry takes place in a Khanzhonkov documentary piece.\n\nDuring the Russian Revolution, Khanzhonkov fled Russia to Constantinople and Vienna, and, despite previous affiliation with the royal family, returned upon invitation to the USSR in 1923 and was appointed director of the new Soviet studio Proletkino and later as a production consultant for Goskino. His career in the Soviet Union ended in 1926: he was forced to abdicate after a corruption scandal struck Proletkino, and never worked in cinema again. Khanzhonkov spent the rest of his life in Yalta, living on a personal pension from the state. There he survived the Nazi occupation of Crimea in 1941–1944, and died in Yalta after many years of declining health on September 26, 1945.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51447853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51447853", "title": "Anne Hill Carter Lee", "text": "Anne Hill Carter Lee\n\nAnne Hill Carter Lee (March 26, 1773 – June 26, 1829) was the wife of the ninth governor of Virginia, Henry Lee III, and the mother of the general-in-chief of the Confederate States of America, Robert E. Lee. As a separated wife and then as a widow, she was the head of her household at Lee Corner, Alexandria, Virginia, in what is now known as the Robert E. Lee Boyhood Home. Her chronic pain and straightened circumstances play a significant role in her son Robert's biography.\n\nAnne was born at the family seat, Shirley Plantation in Charles City County, on March 26, 1773. She was born into a patrician family of tidewater Virginia, and was the daughter of Charles Carter (1732–1806), the fifth generation owner of Shirley Plantation, and Anne Butler (née Moore) Carter (1750–1809).\n\nThrough her grandfather, John Carter (1690/6–1742), she was the great-granddaughter of Robert \"King\" Carter, the 25th Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses from 1696 to 1697 and the Colonial Governor of Virginia from 1726 to 1727. \n\nOn June 18, 1793, she married the 9th Governor of Virginia, the widower Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee (1756–1818), in the mansion's parlor. After Lee retired from the governorship in December 1794, she followed him to his Lee family holdings in northern Virginia. Six children were born to this marriage:\n\n\nAnne Carter Lee's time as a wealthy patrician of northern Virginia would, however, be short. Their principal plantation, Stratford Hall, was relinquished in 1808 by entail to her stepson Henry Lee IV. Her husband had suffered repeated financial reverses, characterized by poor investments, and was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1809 and move to debtor's prison. Anne Carter and \"Light Horse Harry\" were separated for one year while the husband was under confinement. \n\nIn 1810, the reunited couple tried to resume life together in Alexandria. Despite the fall in his honor and standing, the former governor \"Light Horse Harry\" had maintained fervent ties to the Federalist Party, and passionately opposed the decision by the other U.S. political party, the Jeffersonians, to declare war on Great Britain in the War of 1812. In a July 1812 outbreak of political violence in Baltimore, War Hawk rioters raided a Federalist strongpoint and tried to lynch its defenders, including Harry Lee. Anne Carter Lee was forced to learn that her husband had suffered serious physical and psychological wounds in the mob outburst.\n\nAs life for him in Alexandria had become impossible, Henry Lee was forced to leave his wife and family. Lee emigrated to the South Atlantic coast and the Caribbean in a series of futile attempts to find a place to recuperate from his injuries. He died on the Georgia coast on 25 March 1818, leaving Anne Carter Lee a middle-class widow. \n\nAs a widow and the head of her household, Anne Carter Lee brought up her surviving children during her remaining eleven years of life. A small bequest from her Carter family enabled her to maintain the house in modest comfort. She suffered, however, from chronic health conditions herself. Her medical diagnosis, if any, is unknown, and her health challenges were primarily recorded as an additional obstacle to the young life of her fourth son Robert. Born in 1807, in his adolescent years Robert E. Lee assisted his mother to run the household. Although not poor, she was not able to face college tuition bills for Robert, who therefore sought higher education opportunities at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Young Lee did not hesitate to use his mother's Carter family kinship ties to co-sign his West Point application. \n\nDuring young Lee's West Point years (1825-1829), Anne Carter Lee's health further declined. She clung to life until the graduation of her son, and was given a place to live and be nursed at the home of an uncle, William Henry Fitzhugh, the Fairfax County plantation of Ravensworth. Anne Hill Carter Lee died in Ravensworth on 26 July 1829. Her son Robert named one of his daughters, \"Anne Carter Lee\" (1839-1862), in honor of his mother.\n\nThrough her son Sydney, she was the grandmother of Confederate Major General Fitzhugh Lee (1835–1905), who later became Governor of Virginia (from 1886 to 1890), diplomat and writer; and served as Major General of U.S. Volunteers during the Spanish–American War, as well as least four more grandsons who served in the Confederate States Army or Navy.\n\nThrough her son Robert, she was the grandmother of seven, including George Washington Custis Lee (1832–1913), who served as Major General in the Confederate Army and aide-de-camp to President Jefferson Davis, who died unmarried; Mary Custis Lee (1835–1918), who died unmarried; William Henry Fitzhugh Lee (1837–1891), who served as Major General in the Confederate Army who married twice; Anne Carter Lee (1839–1862), who died unmarried of typhoid fever; Eleanor Agnes Lee (1841–1873), who died unmarried of tuberculosis; Robert Edward Lee, Jr. (1843–1914), who served as Captain of the Rockbridge Artillery and who married twice; and Mildred Childe Lee (1846–1905), who died unmarried.\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

He was the head of the Krupp steel conglomerate beginning in the 1950s. He was credited with helping to lead the re-industrialization of the Ruhr Valley and rebuilding Germany into an industrial power. He gained acclaim for saving some 250 Jewish workers during World War II by declaring them to be essential workers at an oil facility in Poland. In 1973, for saving Jews, he received the Righteous Among the Nations title awarded by the Israeli Yad Vashem, the highest honor given to a non-Jew.\n\nBeitz was born in 1913 in Zemmin, Hither Pomerania. He began his career as a banker at the \"Pommersche Bank\" in Stralsund and started to work for Shell Oil Company in Hamburg in 1938.\n\nBeitz remained in the employ of Shell Oil when World War II began in 1939. Following Germany's invasion and occupation of Borysław in July 1941, Beitz was assigned to supervise the Carpathian Oil Company operating the Borysław oil fields in what is now Ukraine. Given the importance of the oil fields to the German war effort, Beitz was able to designate workers as essential to the war effort. The Borysław area had a large Jewish population, with many Jews holding positions as chemical engineers, laboratory assistants, mechanics, and laborers in the area's oil industry.\n\nAfter witnessing the \"Invaliden-Aktion\" in August 1942, an SS-led evacuation of a Jewish orphanage in Borysław, Beitz became determined to act to save local Jews. Having a position of importance, Beitz received advance word of Nazi actions against local Jews and provided warning to the Jewish community. He also had the opportunity to select suitable workers from Jews who were being held at transfer points for deportation to concentration camps. In August 1942, he \"extricated 250 Jewish men and women from the transport train to the Belzec extermination camp by claiming them as 'professional workers.'\" Beitz recalled, \"I should have employed qualified personnel. Instead, I chose tailors, hairdressers and Talmudic scholars and gave them all cards as vital 'petroleum technicians.'\"\n\nTogether with his wife Else, Beitz also hid Jews in his home. He also issued and signed fake work permits to save other Jews from the death camps. In 1943, Beitz's efforts were nearly exposed after two Jewish girls were arrested on a train to Hungary with forged \"Aryan\" permits signed by Beitz. Beitz survived despite a Gestapo investigation into the incident, but he was drafted into the German army in March 1944. In total, Beitz has been credited with saving the lives of 800 Jews.\n\nBeitz later explained his motivation: \"I saw how people were shot, how they were lined up in the night. My motives were not political; they were purely humane, moral motives.\" In another interview, he explained: \"It wasn't anti-Fascism, nor was it resistance. We saw from dawn to dusk, as close as could be, what was happening to Boryslav's Jews. When you see a mother holding her children being shot, while you yourself have children, your reaction has to be completely different.\"\n\nFor his efforts in saving Jewish workers, Beitz received Poland's highest civilian honor. In 1973, he was also honored by Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust memorial, as a \"Righteous Among the Nations\", the organization's highest honor for non-Jews who saved Jews from the Holocaust. According to Yad Vashem, \"The Jews that he rescued from deportation included many unqualified workers, often in poor physical condition, who could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as 'professionals' or indispensable to the oil industry.\"\n\nAfter the war, Beitz became the head of Iduna, an insurance company. His innovative business methods and compensation brought him attention. In 1953, Alfried Krupp hired him to become chairman of the Krupp steel corporation. He remained with the company for 60 years and helped build it into a publicly traded conglomerate, merging the company in the 1990s to form ThyssenKrupp. Beitz has also been credited with helping to lead the re-industrialization of the Ruhr Valley where Krupp's operations were based.\n\nAfter Alfried Krupp's death in 1967, Beitz served as executor and persuaded the Krupp heirs to establish a charitable foundation known as the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation. The foundation still owns 25% of ThyssenKrupp. Beitz remained active in the foundation and led its effort to fund the creation of the Museum Folkwang in Essen.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1988, Beitz was a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and an honorary member until his death. From 1984 to 1988, he was an IOC vice president and executive board member.\n\nIn 2000, he received the Leo-Baeck Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Central Council of Jews in Germany.\n\nIn July 2013, Beitz died at age 99 at his holiday home on the island of Sylt off the northern coast of Germany. He is survived by his wife Else and three daughters. Following Beitz's death, Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, called Beitz \"one of the great Germans of the past century.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It was demolished in 1920 and the property redeveloped for the then owner's department store business.\n\nThe first Boyd's Opera House in Omaha was built in 1881 at 15th and Farnam Streets by James E. Boyd. In addition to serving as Nebraska's governor and Omaha's mayor, Boyd was a successful railroad and real estate developer. One of the first celebrities to appear at the original Boyd's was Oscar Wilde in 1882. After the original Boyd Opera House burned twelve years later, Boyd built his new 2,000 seat theater and opera house at 17th and Harney Streets.\n\nThe new five story theater was constructed on an iron framework with a pressed red brick exterior. There was retail space on the street level, and office space within the interior. The total cost of construction and furnishings was $250,000. The Boyd Theater's stage was 78 feet wide, 40 feet deep and 60 feet high. The curtain drops were 26 feet by 46 feet. The proscenium was modeled after an ornate arch in the Taj Mahal. The theater was decorated in tones of sage green and soft tones of olive to compliment the electric lighting throughout.\n\nThere were 17 full sets of scenery when the theater opened on September 3, 1891. The first play presented on the house's stage was \"Alabama\", with Thomas F. Boyd as the theater's manager. One particularly elaborate production of \"Henry V\" required the theater to accommodate 10 train cars of armour, 200 trunks of costumes, 167 professional actors and 21 full sets. Once local actors were added to the production, the cast ultimately rose to 300. The Boyd Theater was capable of handling even productions of this size.\n\nSome of the most prominent actors of the time appeared on the Boyd Theater's stage. English Shakespearean actors Sir Henry Irving and Dame Ellen Terry appeared twice in Omaha. The first time was April 20 and 21, 1900 with the productions of \"Merchant of Venice\", \"Nance Oldfield\" and \"The Bells\". Their second appearances occurred on December 31, 1901 and January 1, 1902. Other toasted performers to grace Boyd Theater's stage included: Otis Skinner, E. H. Sothern, John Drew, Walker Whiteside, Robert B. Mantell Joseph Jefferson, Leslie Carter, Julia Marlowe, Ethel Barrymore and Maude Adams.\n\nA man bled to death in the wings of the Boyd Theater during one performance, with no one in the audience the wiser. A song and dance man, Jim Mulligan, died after being stabbed by Arthur Sprague, a stage manager, after making an offensive comment about Mrs. Sprague.\nIn 1905, Sarah Bernhardt appeared on the Boyd Theater stage in \"La Tosca\". Bernhardt traveled with her own custom railway car. Also traveling with her on the train was her own carriage, a team of black horses, and a French coachman and hostler. The entire city knew when Bernhardt was in town.\n\nOmaha-born pianist Frances Nash, who would later marry Edwin Watson, friend and senior advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, often performed at Boyd's Theater.\n\nThe man primarily responsible for the quality and the variety of the shows appearing on the Boyd Theater's stage was William J. Burgess. Burgess had been involved in theaters since the age of 12. He initially came to Omaha to manage the Grand Opera House and later managed the original Boyd Theater. When the Creighton Orpheum Theater opened, he served as its manager for two years. Once that theater joined the Orpheum Circuit, he took over the management of the second Boyd Theater and set about making it the premier live theater venue in Omaha. He introduced the first mail-order tickets in town and strived to book the premier acts. He even opened an acting school for fledging dramatists. But even Burgess's efforts could not sway the audiences changing tastes towards motion pictures and the rising costs of mounting a live stage production.\n\nIn 1914, Boyd's Theater was sold to the Burgess-Nash Company for $231,000. Initially they continued to manage it as a theater, but as the competition from talking movies increased, the company eventually closed the theater. The last performance in the theater was on February 2, 1920. It was demolished in 1920 and the property redeveloped for their department store business. Currently, the property houses the Omaha Public Power District's downtown office.\n\n"}

Duperreault became a credentialed actuary with the Casualty Actuarial Society in 1975.\n\nIn December 2013, Duperreault came out of retirement a second time to establish Hamilton Insurance Group, a Bermuda-based holding company, with principals of Two Sigma, a technology company, The company goal was to use a variety of forms of technology, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and distributed computing, to improve underwriting and investment strategies.\n\nIn May 2017, AIG named Duperreault as its new President and Chief Executive Officer, replacing Peter Hancock. At the same time AIG announced that it would acquire Hamilton Insurance Group's US platform and partner with Hamilton and Two Sigma.\n\nDuperreault and his wife Nancy have three sons: Daniel, David and Christopher. He credits his career success to his Jesuit education at Saint Joseph’s University. A devout Catholic, he said of his faith, \"It’s everything. It’s the essence of who I am. I try to pray for guidance all the time. It’s the best counsel you can seek.\" Duperreault claims the impact of his faith was most apparent when he was offered the opportunity to rehabilitate Marsh & McLennan, which had been suffering organizational and financial woes.\n\nDuperreault donated $10 million to his alma mater Saint Joseph’s University, the largest individual gift in the history of the university. He also worked on charitable matters in China with former US President Jimmy Carter. Duperreault developed Bermuda’s charitable sector, chairing the Council Partners Charitable Trust, The Centre on Philanthropy, the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), and establishing The Duperreault Fellowship, an annual scholarship for professionals to enhance their credentials in combating substance abuse.\n\n\n"}

He frequently serves as a guest panelist on the FOX Business Network program segment \"The Cost Of Freedom\" and the stocks/business news program \"Cashin' In\".\n\nGasparino was born to an Italian-American family in the Bronx, Gasparino graduated with a B.A. from Pace University before earning his master's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.\n\nGasparino was previously a senior writer for \"Newsweek\", where he covered politics, Wall Street, and corporate America, and among other stories broke the news of the controversial pay package of former New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso, former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik's controversial (and eventually withdrawn) nomination to run the US Department of Homeland Security, and the dispute surrounding former New York Attorney General (and eventual Governor) Eliot Spitzer's crackdown on corporate crime. Before working at \"Newsweek\", Gasparino was a reporter for \"The Wall Street Journal.\" During his time at the \"WSJ\" he wrote extensively on issues on Wall Street, including pension funds, mutual funds and regulatory issues. He won the New York Press Club award for coverage of Wall Street research scandals. Gasparino then moved to cable business network CNBC where he reported extensively on Wall Street. During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, Gasparino played a major role in CNBC's coverage, breaking a number of stories, including the news that the U.S. Government was going to bail out insurer AIG, as well as news of the US government's broader bailout of the financial system, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).\n\nGasparino, known for being highly combative on-air (Marketwatch described him as \"Fox's Rocky Balboa\"), was reported in \"The Washington Post\" as saying that \"[his] job was to rip the lungs out of the competition for Fox Business Network.\" A \"Financial Times\" profile of Gasparino illustrates his combativeness, describing him as a \"pugnacious pundit Wall Street can't ignore\", citing as examples Gasparino's frequent run-ins with colleagues, including then-fellow CNBC reporter Dennis Kneale, and cycling star Lance Armstrong. Despite his aggressiveness, his reporting frequently has a dramatic impact on the markets. The \"Financial Times\" quotes Goldman Sachs's then-chief spokesman Lucas Van Praag as saying \"Most trading floors have CNBC on with the sound turned down, but when Charlie comes on, they listen... [H]e does move stock prices.\" Similarly, Gasparino's then-colleague at CNBC Lawrence Kudlow said of him: \"He broke some great stories. I give Charlie a lot of credit for having great sources and, to tell you the truth, most of his steers have been good. He has got us ahead of the game.\"\n\nIn February 2010, Gasparino left CNBC for the fledgling Fox Business Network. In addition to his book writing, Gasparino appears on Fox Business and Fox News Channel with news reports and commentary, as well as contributing regularly to \"The New York Post\" and \"Forbes\" and online for The Daily Beast, FoxBusiness.com, and the Huffington Post. At Fox, Gasparino has broken stories on, among others, the US government's plans to sell its stake in Citigroup and the government's pressure on Bank of America to shrink itself. In one dig at his former channel, while CNBC was interviewing John Mack, chairman of Morgan Stanley, who declared on air that \"[t]his doesn't feel like the crisis that I went through [in 2008], so I feel a lot better about it,\" Gasparino timed his report of Morgan Stanley's laying off 1,200 workers and closing up to 300 branches so that it aired opposite the interview. Although notably combative towards his former network (\"My job is to come up with a scoop (everyday) and promote that scoop,\" he said. \"Just jam it down CNBC's throat every single day.\"), Gasparino has also spoken highly of his former colleagues, calling Maria Bartiromo \"a good reporter,\" Erin Burnett \"a class act -- I used to love doing TV with her,\" and of Jim Cramer, \"I like Jim personally.\" In response to accusations of being as much a showman as a journalist, Gasparino has said, \"You want to be entertaining when you present news. People don't want a droll Charlie Gasparino droning on about Merrill Lynch.\" \n\nIn 2010, Marketwatch named Gasparino one of \"12 Broadcasters Who Are Making a Difference\", and The Daily Beast called him one of the \"Top 15 \"Economic and Business Commentators\" (and the only television journalist on the list).\n\nGasparino also posts breaking news updates on Twitter and for several years regularly filled in for John Batchelor on Friday nights as the host of \"The John Batchelor Show\" on WABC-AM in New York City.\n\nIn 2005, Gasparino wrote \"Blood on the Street: The Sensational Inside Story of How Wall Street Analysts Duped a Generation of Investors\", published by Free Press. In November 2007, HarperCollins released Gasparino's second book, \"King of the Club: Richard Grasso and the Survival of the New York Stock Exchange\", which covered the rise and fall of former New York Stock Exchange head Richard Grasso, from the outrage occasioned by his near-$140 million compensation package.\n\nGasparino's latest book, \"Bought and Paid For: The Unholy Alliance Between Barack Obama and Wall Street\", was published by Sentinel, a division of publisher Penguin Putnam. on October 5, 2010. His previous book, covering the financial crisis from its inception in the 1970s to the present day, its impact on the economy and on the financial markets, is entitled \"The Sellout: How Wall Street Greed and Government Mismanagement Destroyed America's Global Financial System\", and was published by HarperCollins in November 2009. A \"The New York Times\" bestseller, \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"USA Today\", and \"Library Journal\" all named it one of the best business books of 2009, and it received the 2009 Investigative Reporters and Editors Award for Books.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "203241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203241", "title": "DIY ethic", "text": "DIY ethic\n\nDIY ethic refers to the ethic of self-sufficiency through completing tasks without the aid of a paid expert. Literally meaning \"do it yourself\", the DIY ethic promotes the idea that anyone is capable of performing a variety of tasks rather than relying on paid specialists. The DIY ethic requires that the adherent seeks out the knowledge required to complete a given task. The term can refer to a variety of disciplines, including home improvement, first aid or creative works.\n\nRather than belittling or showing disdain for those who engage in manual labor or skilled crafts, DIY champions the average individual seeking such knowledge and expertise. Central to the ethic is the empowerment of individuals and communities, encouraging the employment of alternative approaches when faced with bureaucratic or societal obstacles to achieving their objectives.\n\nIn the punk subculture, the DIY ethic is tied to punk ideology and anticonsumerism. It supports the rejection of consumer culture, using existing systems or existing processes that would foster dependence on established societal structures. According to the punk aesthetic, one can express oneself and produce moving and serious works with limited means. Arguably the earliest example of this attitude was the punk music scene of the 1970s. Emerging punk bands such as Death, who recorded their earliest demos in a bedroom without any professional equipment, began to record their music, produce albums, merchandise, distribute and promote their works independently, outside the established music industry system. So extreme was their desire for independence that they often performed at basement shows in residential homes rather than at traditional venues in order to avoid corporate sponsorship and ensure their creative freedom. Since many venues tend to shy away from more experimental music, houses and other private venues were often the only places these bands could play.\n\nRiot grrrl, associated with third-wave feminism, also adopted the core values of the DIY punk ethic by leveraging creative ways of communication through zines and other projects.\n\nAdherents of the DIY punk ethic can also work collectively. For example, punk impresario David Ferguson's CD Presents was a DIY concert production, recording studio, and record label network.\n\nThe German punk band perfected the mass production of the self-made DIY album. Their album included a tinkered wooden cover and sold over 6000 units from their website and other alternative sources.\n\nThe DIY punk ethic also applies to simple everyday living, such as:\n\n\nSome educators also engage in DIY teaching techniques, sometimes referred to as Edupunk.\n\nCommercial DIY music has its origins in the mid 1970s punk rock scene. It developed as a way to circumnavigate the mainstream music industry. By controlling the entire production and distribution chain, DIY music bands can develop a closer relationship between artists and fans. The DIY ethic gives total control over the final product without need to compromise with record labels.\n\nIn the skateboarding culture, DIY skateparks are parks or skate spots made by skaters themselves. That involves woodworking, concrete work and a vast variety of craftsmanship to build the most original and creative spaces to skate.\n\nThe most world-renowned, and probably first, DIY skatepark ever built was Burnside Skatepark, located in Portland, OR. Built without permission by skateboarders and later sanctioned by the city, Burnside is the preeminent example of action. The Park appears in the movie Free Willy in 1993 and years after that, in 1999, the park is part of Tony Hawk's Tony Hawk (series) video game. In 2007, it becomes the epicenter for Gus Van Sant's Paranoid Park (film).\n\nAfter that the culture spread over and other parks started to appear. Philadelphia's FDR Skatepark, San Diego's Washington Street, San Pedro's Channel Street, Seattle's Marginal Way, St Louis' King's Highway and most recently Portland's Brooklyn Street Skate Spot.\n\nThe DIY skateboarding culture made its way to Europe, Brazil's Praça Duó and other parts of the world, being the main style and theme for Pontus Alv's unique approach to skateboarding film making in \"Strongest of the Strange\".\n\nDIY bicycle projects can include creative ways to revamp or transform your bike, but are primarily built on empowering cyclists to understand how their bikes work and how easy they are to fix themselves in order to make cycling an even easier transportation option. Cycling has also seen an explosion of DIY-style shops (\"bike co-ops\"), such as the Bicycle Kitchen in Los Angeles, where anyone can come in and be mentored by a volunteer and get access to tools for maintaining and modifying their own bicycle.\n\nHaving originated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the form of the free festival movement, mutating through protest camps (thus incorporating elements of earlier radical tendencies such as the beat and peace movements) and into punk through bands such as Crass, DIY culture became something of a recognised movement in the 1990s in the UK, where the protest (the direct action) and party (the festival) converged. The prime example of this movement was the Exodus Collective. This development constituted a significant cross-pollination of pleasure and politics resembling the anti-disciplinary politics of the 1960s. During the 1990s, demonstrating the desire for an economy of mutual aid and co-operation, the commitment to the non-commodification of art, the appropriation of digital and communication technologies for free community purposes, and the commitment to alternative technologies such as biodiesel. From 1991–1997 the Conservative government cracked down on squatting, animal rights activists, greens, travellers, as well as , parties and dance culture.\n\nIn 1994, the United Kingdom passed the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which contained several sections designed to curtail the growing free party and anti-road protest movements (sometimes embodied by ravers and travellers). It empowered police to arrest citizens who appeared to be preparing to hold a rave, waiting for a rave to start, or attending a rave.\n\nDIY culture in the United States can be linked to many of the same philosophies of the Arts and Crafts movement of the 1900s, which sought to reconnect people with hands-on activities and the aesthetics associated with them. This was in direct opposition to the prevailing industrialization and modernization which was moving many aspects of the culture's aesthetics away from the hand-made artisan-created styles of the past and toward a mass-produced sleek modern vision of the future. DIY culture in the US arguably evolved from a simple cost-saving activity of the 1940s and 1950s to an increasingly radical political activity which stood against the increasingly visible trends of mass-production, conspicuous consumerism, waste, and the industrial corporate philosophy of planned obsolescence. DIY culture in the US is a current and evolving loose coalition of various individuals. There are many members of DIY culture with distinct and activist philosophies and goals, such as Betsy Greer who coined the term Craftivism in 2003. There are also many people with a staunch neutrality of political and social issues adopted by other members of the DIY movement. The largest group fall into an area somewhere between these two opposites, as varied in the spectrum of political and social philosophy as members of any large and thriving subculture.\n\nIn John Isaacson's book \"Do-It-Yourself Screenprinting\", published by Portland, Oregon's Microcosm Publishing, who gained fame by publishing and distributing a wide variety of zines, Jason Munn is quoted in a \"screenprinter profile\" as relating to the medium as follows:\nI loved the idea of designing or illustrating something and doing the printing myself. Most of my time is spent in front of the computer so the printing is a great way to get my hands dirty again, so to speak.\nIn modern society, it is uncommon for people to go more than a part of a day without interacting with computers or other modern technology. This leads to disconnect between the person and the physical world around them - including other people - and is a secondary significant motivating force in leading people to embrace DIY culture.\n\nCarla Sinclair, Editor in Chief of \"Craft\" attempts to describe the DIY community: \"This DIY renaissance embraces crafts while pushing them beyond traditional boundaries, either through technology, irony, irreverence, and creative recycling, or by using innovating materials and processes...the new craft movement encourages people to make things themselves rather than buy what thousands of others already own. It provides new venues for crafters to show and sell their wares, and it offers original, unusual, alternative, and better-made goods to consumers who choose not to fall in step with mainstream commerce.\" Ellen Lupton embellishes these thoughts in her book D.I.Y. Design It Yourself: \"Around the world, people are making things themselves in order to save money, to customize goods to suit their exact needs and interests, and to feel less dependent on the corporations that manufacture and distribute most of the products and media we consume. On top of these practical and political motivations is the pleasure that comes from developing an idea, making it physically real, and sharing it with other people.\" The articulation of both Isaacson and Lupton is that DIY activities and culture not only are unique in a modern world of consumerism, they give pleasure to its members simply due to the lack of corporate control or thoughts of profit and marketability which are often assigned to the act of creation outside the world of fine art.\n\nThese views are not universal or without variation, however. In Tsia Carson's introduction to her book 'Craftivity: 40 Projects for the DIY Lifestyle,' she muses that \"the kind of agency one gains over their life by making their things is certainly powerful, heady stuff. But I can't honestly say that is \"why\" I make things. Do I make things for spiritual reasons? I wonder if I'm ready to speak of crafting as a form of meditation when I compare the crochet hats I make for my daughter's stuffed monkey to venerable practices like making Tibetan sand mandalas. We make things for two reasons: pleasure and because we can.\" While some ascribe political or social context to their DIY activities, others ascribe personal or spiritual dimensions.\n\nMatt Maranian, author of 'Pad: The Guide to Ultra-Living,' a guide to making your own home decor specifically intended not to look like it was purchased in any store, illustrates another aspect of DIY culture: \"Pad is not a book for the helpless, the aimless, or the clueless, Pad is a book for the empowered, the inspired, and the creative. It's a book for people who forge their own trail, and who know how to make the very most of what they have at hand — or can find cheaply. Pad is the guerrilla approach to home decorating.\" Matt articulates the sense of community and subculture present in DIY culture, perhaps even hinting at a kind of intellectual succession from a society deemed \"helpless...aimless...clueless.\"\n\nThe first lines of Amy Spencer's 'DIY: The Rise of Lo-Fi Culture' sum up the juxtaposition of DIY culture's aspects by pointing out \"the DIY movement is about using anything you can get your hands on to shape your own cultural entity: your own version of whatever you think is missing in mainstream culture. You can produce your own zine, record an album, publish your own book — the enduring appeal of this movement is that anyone can be an artist or creator. The point is to get involved.\"\n\nTechnological developments, new internet platforms, applications and innovations in the last ten years have made it easier for artists, makers and creators of all types to circumvent professional studios and create high-quality work themselves. Developments in media software and the proliferation of high-speed internet access have given artists of all ages and abilities from across the globe, the opportunity to make their own films, records, or other creative content, and distribute it over the web. Such works were usually displayed on a private homepage, and gained popularity through word-of-mouth recommendations or being attached to chain letters (known as viral distribution).\n\nSites like Newgrounds and DeviantArt allow users to post their art and receive community critique, while Instructables allows DIYers to exhibit their works in an instructional how-to format. It is becoming common for content creators to share and receive compensation for their work online. Musicians can distribute their wares over the internet, independently of commercial funding, using the same computer they used to record.\n\n"}

The organization states that its goals are to: \"identify the best and brightest early career scientists in cancer research, accelerate the translation of scientific discoveries into new diagnostic tools and treatments, and to enable risk-taking on bold new ideas\".\n\nThe organization was founded in 1946 by media personality Walter Winchell in New York City, New York, under the name Damon Runyon Cancer Memorial Fund in memory of his colleague and friend Damon Runyon, a newspaperman and author.\n\nAlmost immediately after Runyon's passing on December 10, 1946, Winchell went on the air and asked his audience for contributions to cancer research. \n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. United States! A very dear friend of mine a great newspaperman, a great writer, and a very great guy Damon Runyon, was killed this week by America's Number Two killer Cancer. It's time we tried to do something to fight this terrible disease. We must fight back, and together we can do it. Won't you send me a penny, a nickel, a dime, or a dollar? All of your money will go directly to the cancer fighters, in Damon Runyon's name. There will be no expenses of any kind deducted.\"\n\nThe organization gained more visibility in 1949 when Milton Berle, a long-time friend of both Runyon and Winchell, hosted the first-ever telethon, raising $1.1 million for the foundation over 16 hours. In its first three decades, the foundation was a popular cause among celebrities from Hollywood to Broadway and the sports world. Marlene Dietrich, Bob Hope, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and many of their contemporaries served as supporters and board members.\n\nThe organization manages six award programs \"aimed at encouraging and advancing the work of early career cancer researchers with high promise\". The Fellowship Award is the oldest and most widely known in the scientific community, giving postdoctoral researchers between $200,000 and $250,000 over four years. Other programs include the Damon Runyon-Sohn Pediatric Cancer Fellowship Award, the Damon Runyon Clinical Investigator Award and the Damon Runyon-Rachleff Innovation Award.\n\nThe foundation has funded twelve Nobel Prize laureates, including Albert Szent-Györgyi, Salvador E.

His mother was Dorothy Blew Fairfield (1881-1942), daughter of Arthur Rowan Fairfield, a civil servant from Ireland. His father, Francis John Longley Ogilvy, (c. 1867 - 1943) was born in Argentina and a self-taught Gaelic-speaker who was a classics scholar and a failed financial broker. He married Sophie Louise Blew Jones. He was a first cousin once removed of the writer Rebecca West and of Douglas Holden Blew Jones, who was the brother-in-law of Freda Dudley Ward and the father-in-law of Antony Lambton, 6th Earl of Durham. Ogilvy attended St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, on reduced fees because of his father's straitened circumstances and won a scholarship at age thirteen to Fettes College, in Edinburgh. In 1929, he again won a scholarship, this time in History to Christ Church, Oxford.\nWithout the scholarships, Ogilvy would not have been able to attend Fettes or Oxford University because his father's business was badly hit by the depression of the mid-1920s. His studies were not successful, however, and he left Oxford for Paris in 1931 where he became an apprentice chef in the Hotel Majestic. After a year, he returned to Scotland and started selling AGA cooking stoves, door-to-door. His success at this marked him out to his employer, who asked him to write an instruction manual, \"The Theory and Practice of Selling the AGA Cooker\", for the other salesmen. Thirty years later, \"Fortune\" magazine editors called it the finest sales instruction manual ever written.\n\nAfter seeing the manual, Ogilvy's older brother Francis Ogilvy—the father of actor Ian Ogilvy—showed the manual to management at the London advertising agency Mather & Crowther where he was working. They offered the younger Ogilvy a position as an account executive.\n\nIn 1938, Ogilvy persuaded his agency to send him to the United States for a year, where he went to work for George Gallup's \"Audience Research Institute\" in New Jersey. Ogilvy cites Gallup as one of the major influences on his thinking, emphasizing meticulous research methods and adherence to reality.\n\nDuring World War II, Ogilvy worked for the British Intelligence Service at the British embassy in Washington, DC. There he analyzed and made recommendations on matters of diplomacy and security. According to a biography produced by Ogilvy & Mather, \"he extrapolated his knowledge of human behaviour from consumerism to nationalism in a report which suggested 'applying the Gallup technique to fields of secret intelligence.'\" Eisenhower’s \"Psychological Warfare Board\" picked up the report and successfully put Ogilvy’s suggestions to work in Europe during the last year of the war.\n\nAlso during World War II David Ogilvy was a notable alumnus of the secret Camp X, located near the towns of Whitby and Oshawa in Ontario, Canada. According to an article on the: \"It was there he mastered the power of propaganda before becoming king of Madison Avenue. Although Ogilvy was trained in sabotage and close combat, he was ultimately tasked with projects that included successfully ruining the reputation of businessmen who were supplying the Nazis with industrial materials.\"\n\nAfter the war, Ogilvy bought a farm in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and lived among the Amish. The atmosphere of \"serenity, abundance, and contentment\" kept Ogilvy and his wife in Pennsylvania for several years, but eventually he admitted his limitations as a farmer and moved to Manhattan.\n\nHaving worked as a chef, researcher, and farmer, Ogilvy now started his own advertising agency with the backing of Mather and Crowther, the London agency being run by his elder brother, Francis, which later acquired another London agency, S.H. Benson. The new agency in New York was called Ogilvy, Benson, and Mather. David Ogilvy had just $6,000 ($59,726.72 in 2016 dollars) in his account when he started the agency. He writes in \"Confessions of an Advertising Man\" that, initially, he struggled to get clients. Ogilvy also admitted (referring to the pioneer of British advertising Bobby Bevan, the chairman of Benson): \"I was in awe of him but Bevan never took notice of me!\" They would meet later, however.\n\nOgilvy & Mather was built on David Ogilvy's principles; in particular, that the function of advertising is to sell and that successful advertising for any product is based on information about its consumer. He disliked advertisements that had loud patronizing voices, and believed a customer should be treated as intelligent. In 1955, he coined the phrase, \"The customer is not a moron, she's your wife\" based on these values.\n\nHis entry into the company of giants started with several iconic advertising campaigns: former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, did a commercial for Good Luck Margarine in 1959. In his autobiography, Ogilvy On Advertising, he said it had been a mistake to persuade her to do the ad – not because it was undignified, but because he had grown to realize that putting celebs in ads is a mistake.\n\n\"The man in the Hathaway shirt\" with his aristocratic eye patch which used George Wrangel as model; \"The man from Schweppes is here\" introduced Commander Edward Whitehead, the elegant bearded Brit, bringing Schweppes (and \"Schweppervescence\") to the U.S.; a famous headline in the automobile business, \"At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock\";\n\"Pablo Casals is coming home – to Puerto Rico\", a campaign which Ogilvy said helped change the image of a country, and was his proudest achievement.\n\nOne of his greatest successes was \"Only Dove is one-quarter moisturizing cream\". This campaign helped Dove become the top selling soap in the U.S.\n\nOgilvy believed that the best way to get new clients was to do notable work for his existing clients. Success in his early campaigns helped Ogilvy get big clients such as Rolls-Royce and Shell. New clients followed and Ogilvy's company grew quickly. He was widely hailed as \"The Father of Advertising\". In 1962, \"Time\" called him \"the most sought-after wizard in today's advertising industry\". \n\nIn 1973, Ogilvy retired as Chairman of Ogilvy & Mather and moved to Touffou, his estate in France. While no longer involved in the agency's day-to-day operations, he stayed in touch with the company. His correspondence so dramatically\nincreased the volume of mail handled in the nearby town of Bonnes that the post office was reclassified at a higher status and the postmaster's salary raised.\n\nOgilvy & Mather linked with H.H.D Europe in 1972.\n\nOgilvy came out of retirement in the 1980s to serve as chairman of Ogilvy, Benson, & Mather in India. He also spent a year acting as temporary chairman of the agency’s German office, commuting weekly between Touffou and Frankfurt. He visited branches of the company around the world, and continued to represent Ogilvy & Mather at\ngatherings of clients and business audiences.\n\nIn 1989, \"The Ogilvy Group\" was bought by WPP Group, a British parent company, for US$864 million in a hostile takeover made possible by the fact that the company group had made an IPO as the first company in marketing to do so.\n\nDuring the takeover procedures, Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder of WPP, was described by Ogilvy as an \"odious little shit\", and he promised to never work again. (Reports softened it to \"odious little jerk\", and when Martin Sorrell signed his next company report, he followed the signature with the letters OLJ.) Two events followed simultaneously, however: WPP became the largest marketing communications firm in the world, and David Ogilvy was named the company's non-executive chairman (a position he held for three years). Eventually he became a fan of Sorrell. A letter of apology from Ogilvy adorns Sorrell's office, which is said to be the only apology David Ogilvy ever offered in any form during his adult life. Only a year after his derogatory comments about Sorrell, he was quoted as saying, 'When he tried to take over our company, I would liked to have killed him. But it was not legal. I wish I had known him 40 years ago. I like him enormously now.'\n\nAt age seventy-five, Ogilvy was asked if anything he'd always wanted had somehow eluded him. His reply was, \"Knighthood. And a big family - ten children.\" His only child, David Fairfield Ogilvy, was born during his first marriage, to Melinda Street. That marriage ended in divorce (1955) as did a second marriage to Anne Cabot. Ogilvy married Herta Lans in France during 1973.\n\nOgilvy was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire (CBE) in 1967. He was elected to the U.S. Advertising Hall of Fame in 1977 and to France's Order of Arts and Letters in 1990. He chaired the Public Participation Committee for Lincoln Center in Manhattan and served as a member of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 100th Anniversary Committee. He was appointed Chairman of the United Negro College Fund in 1968, and trustee on the Executive Council of the World Wildlife Fund in 1975. Mr. Ogilvy was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nDavid Ogilvy died on 21 July 1999 at his home, the Château de Touffou, in Bonnes, France.\n\nHis book \"Ogilvy on Advertising\" is a general commentary on advertising. His book \"Confessions of an Advertising Man\" is a book on advertising.\n\nOgilvy's advertising philosophy followed these four basic principles:\n\nWhile Ogilvy was most famous for building and establishing brands, he was primarily interested in direct marketing. He initially built his agency using a direct mail promotion. He ran direct response advertisements in major newspapers to generate leads. In a video titled, \"We Sell or Else\", he praised direct marketers and direct marketing while pillorying \"general\" or branding advertising, at one point saying that branding people \"worship at the altar of creativity.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Kennedy honored her by awarding her the first \"Citation of Merit for Distinguished Service.\" She often found herself in the middle of historic events. As she stated, \"I think nobody can deny that I have always had through sheer luck a box seat at the America of my times.\"\n\nHarriman was born Florence Jaffray Hurst on July 21, 1870 in New York City to shipping magnate F.W.J. Hurst and his wife Caroline. When she was three years old, her mother, then 29, died. She and her two sisters (Caroline Elise and Ethel) were raised in and around New York City by her father and maternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Somerville Jaffray. At age six, she watched her first political torchlight parade, part of the 1876 presidential campaign. \"She later told of leaning over the bannister of her home at 615 Fifth Avenue, to hear visitors such as John Hay, President James A. Garfield, and President Chester A. Arthur.\"\n\nShe was known throughout her life as \"Daisy.\"\n\nBetween 1880 and 1888, she received private lessons at the home of financier J. P. Morgan. She also attended the Misses Lockwood's Collegiate School for Girls.\n\nIn 1889, at age nineteen, she married J. Borden Harriman, a New York banker (and an elder cousin of future cabinet secretary, New York Governor and diplomat W. Averell Harriman). The list of attendees at their wedding included past and future president Grover Cleveland, railroad tycoons Cornelius Vanderbilt and Edward Harriman, John Jacob Astor IV, and J. P. Morgan. They had one child, Ethel M.B. Harriman, born on December 11, 1897. Ethel worked on Broadway and in Hollywood, as an actress and writer (as Ethel Russell or Ethel Borden).\n\nFor many years, Harriman led the life of a young society matron interested in charitable and civic activities. Her life revolved around Mount Kisco, New York (where their estate overlooked the Hudson River), Fifth Avenue in New York City, and Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nIn 1903, she co-founded with Ava Lowle Willing (then-Mrs. John Jacob Astor IV) and Helen Hay Whitney (Mrs. Payne Whitney) the Colony Club, New York City's first club exclusively for women. However, instead of restricting her social and civic activities to the wealthy or to members of her husband's political party (the Republican Party), she reached out to others. For example, in 1908, she led efforts by the New York chapter of the National Women's Committee to expose harsh working conditions in New York City's factories, foundries and hotels. She explained, \"Should not the woman who spends the money which the employees help to provide take a special interest in their welfare, especially in that of the women wage earners?\" In 1909, she created waves when, as the \"wife of a banker,\" she \"entertained one hundred members of the International Brotherhood of Stationary Firemen at her summer home.\" In 1906, Republican Governor Charles Evans Hughes appointed her as a member of the Board of Managers of New York State Reformatory for Women at Bedford, New York.\n\nAs Harriman would later explain in her book \"From Pinafores to Politics,\" her leadership and organizing skills became increasingly directed toward the disenfranchised and impoverished. She was active in the women's suffrage movement in support of extending the vote to women, reportedly leading a parade of suffragists down Fifth Avenue. She also crusaded against unhealthy conditions in New York's tenements. Franklin D. Roosevelt later described her as \"the woman who was most responsible for helping to provide milk for dependent poor children in the great city of New York.\"\n\nIn 1912, Harriman's active support for the presidential campaign of then-New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson led to national publicity and leadership roles. She was elected as the first president of the \"Women's National Wilson and Marshall Association,\" and organized mass meetings, and mass mailings, in support of his campaign.\n\nUpon taking office, Wilson appointed Harriman as a member of the first U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations, which Congress had authorized the previous year. After 154 days of testimony, the Commission could not agree on the causes and solutions to labor-management difficulties. Harriman and Commissioner John R. Commons refused to sign the caustic report written by Commission Chair Frank P. Walsh. As Commons and Harriman wrote in their separate report (joined by a narrow majority of Commissioners), the Walsh report mistakenly focused on individual \"scapegoats rather than on the system that produces the demand for scapegoats.\"\n\nHer husband became seriously ill in February 1913, shortly before Wilson took office. After President Wilson's appointment, Washington, D.C. became their primary residence. While serving on the Commission on Industrial Relations, she also continued to serve in New York on the Bedford Reformatory board.\n\nHarriman, her husband and daughter found themselves in the middle of Europe as World War I erupted in the summer of 1914. Hoping that the healing waters in the Bohemian spa in Karlsbad would benefit her husband, Harriman brought her family to Europe in June 1914. After meeting with leading British and French officials while relations between the European powers deteriorated, they traveled through France to Karlsbad (then a part of Austria-Hungary), and were there when Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia in late July. After leaving Karlsbad on the last train crossing the frontier through Germany to France, they eventually returned to New York on an armed British vessel, the \"RMS Adriatic\". Her husband's health continued to deteriorate, and he died on December 1, 1914. His prolonged illness, the resulting lack of income, and the expense of maintaining several homes had consumed nearly all of his net worth. Harriman never remarried.\n\nThe following year, Harriman found herself near the front lines of another war - the battle along the south side of the Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, between supporters of rebel Pancho Villa and the armies of Mexican leader Venustiano Carranza. During a break in hearings on working conditions for farmworkers that she conducted in Dallas in March 1915, she accepted an offer to visit the Rio Grande area, where the United States was attempting to remain neutral as Mexican factions battled each other along the river. After watching the battle for Matamoros, Tamaulipas from Brownsville, she began to tend to the wounded and visited the smoking battlefields, before returning to Washington.\n\nHarriman increased her charitable and political activity. She turned her Mount Kisco home into a tuberculosis sanitarium. During the period of American neutrality, she became a cofounder of the Committee of Mercy, which was created to help the women and children and other European noncombatants made destitute by the war. In May 1916 she was recruited by Eleanor Roosevelt to lead a contingent of \"Independent Patriotic Women of America\" in a preparedness parade. After the United States declared war on Germany, she organized the American Red Cross Women's Motor Corps of the District of Columbia, and directed the Women's Motor Corps in France. From 1917 to 1919, she served as chair of the U.S. National Defense Advisory Commission's Committee on Women in Industry.\n\nHarriman participated in the Versailles Peace Conference, and upon her return was an advocate for American participation in the League of Nations, and worked on behalf of world peace organizations.\n\nWhile the Wilson Administration ended in 1921, Harriman's Democratic activism did not. Syndicated columnist William Hard described her as \"a candle for the party in its darkest days.\" She began serving as member of the Democratic National Committee in 1920 (a position she would hold until the 1950s) and in 1922 became a founder and the first president of the Woman's National Democratic Club. Her first book, \"From Pinafores to Politics,\" was published in 1923. She was often in the company of another widowed fixture of 1920s Washington, Montana U.S. Senator Thomas J. Walsh. She resided in a large home known as \"Uplands,\" on a hill off Foxhall Road northwest of Georgetown.\n\nTime Magazine would report in 1934 that her \"Sunday night salons have long been a Washington institution.\" She would invite up to 32 guests with diverse viewpoints, then referee a thorough off-the-record discussion of a single controversial issue. She enforced two ground rules: no one was ever to grow angry, and no one was to repeat what had been said.\n\nHarriman reportedly \"lost most of her fortune during the Depression,\" and \"had to eke out her income by interior decorating and real estate\" (while sharing her Washington home with well-paying guests). One such cohabitant in the first year of the Roosevelt Administration was the first woman cabinet member, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins.\n\nAs a member of the Democratic National Committee, Harriman was also a District of Columbia delegate to the Party's conventions. In 1932, when the Convention nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harriman did not support him. According to \"Time\", \"she unfortunately held out for Newton D. Baker or Melvin Traylor.\" In her own words, this would cause \"the triumphant members of the Roosevelt-before-the-Convention inner clique\" to have \"a little grey mark against me.\" However, \"after Roosevelt's nomination she hastened to repair her mistake,\" and became one of Roosevelt's strongest supporters at the 1936 Convention.\n\nEarly in his second term, Roosevelt scrambled many of his diplomatic assignments. Norway, the fourth nation to grant woman suffrage (after New Zealand, Australia and Finland), was considered \"an obvious post for a woman diplomat.\" Thus, in 1937, Harriman was appointed as the United States' Minister to Norway. (Her precise title was \"Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary\" for Norway.) At the time of her appointment, she could hardly have known that this role would soon require her to draw on her experience in helping refugees in the previous World War.\nConsequently, increasing tension in Europe and the imminent death of Turkish reformer Atatürk, compelled her to advise Secretary of State Hull to install Ismet Inonu as President of Turkey to assure a protectionist ally in the region.\n\nIn 1940, Germany invaded Norway with little warning, causing Harriman and the rest of the American legation in Norway to join certain members of the Norwegian royal family and other refugees seeking protection hundreds of kilometers away in Sweden. In the chaos and bombardment, America suffered its first military casualty when Captain Robert M. Losey, a U.S. military attaché assisting the evacuation while observing the war, was killed in a Luftwaffe attack on Dombås. The rest of the American legation ultimately arrived safely in Sweden. Harriman is credited with arranging for the safety of other Americans and several members of the Norwegian royal family -- Crown Princess Märtha and her children Ragnhild, Astrid and Harald.\n\nShe returned to the Nordic countries to complete the evacuation of current and future U.S. citizens through Finland on the United States Army transport in August 1940. In January 1941, she officially left her position, became a vice-chair of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, and testified in the House Foreign Affairs Committee in favor of the Lend-Lease Act. Her service in Norway, and the harrowing escape, became the subject of her next book, \"Mission to the North,\" published in 1941. In July 1942, King Haakon VII of Norway (then in exile) conferred upon Harriman the Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav.\n\nAfter the United States entered World War II, Harriman continued to write on causes important to her, and wrote the foreword to the English-language edition booklet of Natalia Zarembina \"Oswiecim, Camp of Death,\" originally published in occupied Poland in 1942 by the PPS WRN. It was one of the first publications on the Holocaust and Auschwitz Concentration Camp in English language, published in New York City in March 1944 before the camp's liberation by Soviet troops. And despite her decades of involvement in the Democratic Party, she joined a bipartisan (but unsuccessful) effort to persuade Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Wendell Willkie, to run for Governor of New York in 1942.\n\nIn 1952, she campaigned on behalf of her cousin by marriage, W. Averell Harriman, in his unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for President.\n\nShe served as the 3rd Vice President of the Board of Directors of the National Conference On Citizenship in 1960.\n\nHarriman lived in the District of Columbia at the time of every presidential election since the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920, but the District received no electoral votes for most of her life, so she effectively could not vote in presidential elections for several decades.\n\nIn 1955, at age 84, Harriman led a parade through the capital to protest \"taxation without representation\" in the District of Columbia. That year, she wrote in a \"New York Times\" letter to the editor that \"the time has come for another Boston tea party\" to end the disenfranchisement of the District's residents.\n\nThe adoption of the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1961 gave three electoral votes to the District, so in 1964, at age 94, Harriman cast her first vote in a presidential election - for Lyndon Johnson.\n\nIn 1956, Life Magazine reported that, even at age 86, she continued to host dinners for twenty-two guests nearly every Sunday night.\n\nHarriman received a Citation of Merit for Distinguished Service, presented by President Kennedy on April 18, 1963 (when she was 92 years old). It states:\n\nIn her illustrious career in public service, Mrs. Harriman has made singular and lasting contributions to the cause of peace and freedom. . . . In all of her endeavors, Mrs. Harriman has exemplified the spirit of selflessness, courage and service to the Nation, reflecting the highest credit on herself and on this country. She has, indeed, earned the esteem and admiration of her countrymen and the enduring gratitude of this Republic.\n\nHarriman died at her home in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., on August 31, 1967.\n\nHer daughter died on July 4, 1953, at age 55. Her granddaughter, Phyllis Russell Marcy Darling, of Eugene, Oregon, died on December 18, 2007, at age 88. Her grandson, Charles Howland Russell, of Carmel Valley, California, died on May 13, 1981, at age 60.\n\n\n"}

Its object and purpose is to suppress the use of forced labour in all its forms irrespective of the nature of the work or the sector of activity in which it may be performed. The Convention defines forced labour as \"all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily\", with few exceptions like compulsorly military service. The convention excludes \"adult able-bodied males\", to whom legal imposition of forced labour is allowed.\n\nThe Convention was adopted in Geneva 28 June 1930 and came into force on 1 May 1932. By the end of 1932 ten countries had ratified the convention (Japan, Bulgaria, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Australia, Sweden, United Kingdom, Liberia, and Ireland). Austria in 1960, Luxembourg in 1964 and Malta in 1965 were the last Western European countries to ratify the convention. Canada ratified it in 2011 and as of 2015 the United States has not ratified it.\nThe Convention was supplemented by the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 which canceled a number of exceptions to abolishment in the 1930 Convention, such as punishment for strikes and as a punishment for holding certain political views.\n\nArticle 2 of the Convention excepts from the term \"forced or compulsory labour\" the following: \n\nArticle 11 of the Convention states that \"forced or compulsory labour\" may be imposed only upon \"adult able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years\".\n\nAs of 2016, the Convention has been ratified 178 of the 187 ILO members. The ILO members that have not ratified the convention are:\n\nUN member states which are not members of the ILO are Andorra, Bhutan, Liechtenstein, Micronesia, Monaco, Nauru, and North Korea; these states are not eligible to ratify the Convention unless they first join the ILO.\n\nIn 2014, a protocol was adopted by the International Labour Conference: P29, Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930. The Protocol was adopted with 437 votes in favour, 8 against and 27 abstentions (there are 3 votes per member state: one for the government, one for employees, and one for employers). The Government of Thailand was the only state to vote against adoption, though it reversed its position a few days later. The protocol obligates states parties to provide protection and appropriate remedies, including compensation, to victims of forced labour and to sanction the perpetrators of forced labour. It also obligates states parties to develop \"a national policy and plan of action for the effective and sustained suppression of forced or compulsory labour\".\n\nOn 14 May 2015, Niger became the first state to ratify the 2014 Protocol. As of November 2016, it has been ratified by nine states: Argentina, Czech Republic, France, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Norway, Panama, and the United Kingdom. The Protocol entered into force on 9 November 2016.\n\n\n"}

The building was built in 1882 in the Queen Anne style as the Washington Building, on the former site of the Washington Hotel. The building was acquired by International Mercantile Marine Company (IMM) in 1919 to serve as its corporate headquarters and extensively altered to its present Neoclassical style. One Broadway served as the headquarters of IMM and its successor company, United States Lines, until 1979 when the firm relocated to Cranford, New Jersey.\n\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 2, 1991. A restoration was carried out in 1992, and the ground floor now houses a Citibank branch in the former lobby space.\n\nThe spot is more famous for its previous use: In the late 18th century it was the Kennedy House, built for Archibald Kennedy, who resided in it until he succeeded as Earl of Cassilis. During the American Revolution it served briefly as headquarters for Generals George Washington and Henry \"Lighthorse Harry\" Lee. The structure survived as the Washington Hotel. In 1884, Edward H. Kendall designed the \"Washington Building\", an ornate commercial building.\n\nThe building was bought by the International Mercantile Marine Company (later known as the United States Lines) in 1920 or 1921, then extensively refaced and remodelled on a maritime theme in 1921 from plans by Walter B. Chambers.\n\nCurrently, the only tenant is a Citibank branch on the ground floor. Kenyon & Kenyon, a prominent intellectual property law firm, was the main tenant on the upper floors until it disbanded.\n\nOn May 15, 2018 it was announced that the building was being sold to Midtown Equities for $140 million and that part of the building will be converted to apartments. Kenyon & Kenyon is vacating the space after the firm disbands and a major group of lawyers from that firm move uptown to merge with Houston-based Andrews Kurth. \n\nThe building has side entrances facing Battery Park which are modeled \"First Class\" and \"Cabin Class\"; The main entrance is surrounded by shells and sea icons; the windows on the second floor alternate with mosaic shields of renowned port cities; inside, a compass rose is prominently depicted in the marble floor, and two enormous murals depict shipping lanes. The former booking room is modelled on an 18th-century ballroom, with columns and elaborate railings at either end, along with four imposing chandeliers. Now a bank branch uses the room as its banking floor. The IMM competed with the Cunard Line, which had remodeled its building in a similar way two years before.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "299978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299978", "title": "John D. Rockefeller Jr.", "text": "John D. Rockefeller Jr.\n\nJohn Davison Rockefeller Jr. (January 29, 1874 – May 11, 1960) was an American financier and philanthropist who was a prominent member of the Rockefeller family. He was the only son among the five children of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller and the father of the five famous Rockefeller brothers. In biographies, he is commonly referred to as \"Junior\" to distinguish him from his father, \"Senior\". His sons included Nelson Rockefeller, the 41st Vice President of The United States; Winthrop Rockefeller, governor of Arkansas; and banker David Rockefeller.\n\nRockefeller was the fifth and last child of Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and schoolteacher Laura Celestia \"Cettie\" Spelman. His four older sisters were Elizabeth (Bessie), Alice (who died an infant), Alta, and Edith. Living in his father's mansion at 4 West 54th Street, he attended Park Avenue Baptist Church at 64th Street (now Central Presbyterian Church) and the Browning School, a tutorial establishment set up for him and other children of associates of the family; it was located in a brownstone owned by the Rockefellers, on West 55th Street. His father John Sr. and uncle William Avery Rockefeller Jr. co-founded Standard Oil together.\n\nInitially he had intended to go to Yale University but was encouraged by William Rainey Harper, president of the University of Chicago, among others, to enter the Baptist-oriented Brown University instead. Nicknamed \"Johnny Rock\" by his roommates, he joined both the Glee and the Mandolin clubs, taught a Bible class, and was elected junior class president. Scrupulously careful with money, he stood out as different from other rich men's sons.\n\nIn 1897 he graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Arts, after taking nearly a dozen courses in the social sciences, including a study of Karl Marx's \"Das Kapital\". He joined the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nAfter graduation from Brown, Rockefeller joined his father's business in October 1897, setting up operations in the newly formed family office at 26 Broadway where he became a director of Standard Oil. He later also became a director at J. P. Morgan's U.S. Steel company, which had been formed in 1901. Junior resigned from both companies in 1910 in an attempt to \"purify\" his ongoing philanthropy from commercial and financial interests after the Hearst media empire unearthed a bribery scandal involving John Dustin Archbold (the successor to Senior as head of Standard Oil) and two prominent members of Congress.\n\nIn April 1914, after a long period of industrial unrest, the Ludlow Massacre occurred at a tent camp occupied by striking miners from the Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&I) company. Junior owned a controlling interest in the company (40% of its stock) and sat on the board as an absentee director. At least 20 men, women, and children died in the incident. This was followed by nine days of violence between miners and the Colorado State Militia. Although he did not order the attack that began this unrest, Junior received much of the public blame for the violence. In January 1915 Junior was called to testify before the Commission on Industrial Relations. Many critics blamed Rockefeller for ordering the massacre. Margaret Sanger wrote an attack piece in her magazine \"The Woman Rebel\", declaring, \"But remember Ludlow! Remember the men and women and children who were sacrificed in order that John D. Rockefeller Jr., might continue his noble career of charity and philanthropy as a supporter of the Christian faith.\" \n\nHe was at the time being advised by William Lyon Mackenzie King and the pioneer public relations expert, Ivy Lee. Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized version of the Rockefellers. Mackenzie King said Rockefeller's testimony was the turning point in Junior's life, restoring the reputation of the family name; it also heralded a new era of industrial relations in the country\n\nDuring the Great Depression he was involved in the financing, development, and construction of the Rockefeller Center, a vast office complex in midtown Manhattan, and as a result became one of the largest real estate holders in New York City. He was influential in attracting leading blue-chip corporations as tenants in the complex, including GE and its then affiliates RCA, NBC and RKO, as well as Standard Oil of New Jersey (now ExxonMobil), Associated Press, Time Inc, and branches of Chase National Bank (now JP Morgan Chase).\n\nThe family office, of which he was in charge, shifted from 26 Broadway to the 56th floor of the landmark 30 Rockefeller Plaza upon its completion in 1933. The office formally became \"Rockefeller Family and Associates\" (and informally, \"Room 5600\").\n\nIn 1921, Junior received about 10% of the shares of the Equitable Trust Company from his father, making him the bank's largest shareholder. Subsequently, in 1930, Equitable merged with Chase National Bank, making Chase the largest bank in the world at the time. Although his stockholding was reduced to about 4% following this merger, he was still the largest shareholder in what became known as \"the Rockefeller bank.\" As late as the 1960s, the family still retained about 1% of the bank's shares, by which time his son David had become the bank's president.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Rockefeller founded the Dunbar National Bank in Harlem. The financial institution was located within the Paul Laurence Dunbar Apartments at 2824 Eighth Avenue near 150th Street, servicing a primarily African-American clientele. It was unique among New York City financial institutions in that it employed African Americans as tellers, clerks and bookkeepers as well as in key management positions. However, the bank folded after only a few years of operation.\n\nIn a celebrated letter to Nicholas Murray Butler in June 1932, subsequently printed on the front page of \"The New York Times\", Rockefeller, a lifelong teetotaler, argued against the continuation of the Eighteenth Amendment on the principal grounds of an increase in disrespect for the law. This letter became an important event in pushing the nation to repeal Prohibition.\n\nRockefeller was known for his philanthropy, giving over $537 million to myriad causes over his lifetime compared to $240 million to his own family. He created the Sealantic Fund in 1938 to channel gifts to his favorite causes; previously his main philanthropic organization had been the Davison Fund. He had become the Rockefeller Foundation's inaugural president in May 1913 and proceeded to dramatically expand the scope of this institution, founded by his father. Later he would become involved in other organizations set up by Senior: Rockefeller University and the International Education Board.\n\nIn the social sciences, he founded the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial in 1918, which was subsequently folded into the Rockefeller Foundation in 1929. A committed internationalist, he financially supported programs of the League of Nations and crucially funded the formation and ongoing expenses of the Council on Foreign Relations and its initial headquarters building in New York in 1921.\n\nHe established the Bureau of Social Hygiene in 1913, a major initiative that investigated such social issues as prostitution and venereal disease, as well as studies in police administration and support for birth control clinics and research. In 1924, at the instigation of his wife, he provided crucial funding for Margaret Sanger (who ironically had previously been an opponent of his because of his mistreatment of workers) in her work on birth control and involvement in population issues. He donated five thousand dollars to her American Birth Control League in 1924 and a second time in 1925.\n\nIn the arts, he gave extensive property he owned on West 54th Street in Manhattan for the site of the Museum of Modern Art, which had been co-founded by his wife in 1929.\n\nIn 1925, he purchased the George Grey Barnard collection of medieval art and cloister fragments for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also purchased land north of the original site, now Fort Tryon Park, for a new building, The Cloisters.\n\nIn November 1926, Rockefeller came to the College of William and Mary for the dedication of an auditorium built in memory of the organizers of Phi Beta Kappa, the honorary scholastic fraternity founded in Williamsburg in 1776. Rockefeller was a member of the society and had helped pay for the auditorium. He had visited Williamsburg the previous March, when the Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin escorted him — along with his wife Abby, and their sons, David, Laurance, and Winthrop — on a quick tour of the city. The upshot of his visit was that he approved the plans already developed by Goodwin and launched the massive historical restoration of Colonial Williamsburg on November 22, 1927. Amongst many other buildings restored through his largesse was The College of William & Mary's Wren Building.\n\nIn 1940 Rockefeller hosted Bill Wilson, one of the original founders of Alcoholics Anonymous, and others at a dinner to tell their stories. \"News of this got out on the world wires; inquiries poured in again and many people went to the bookstores to get the book, \"Alcoholics Anonymous.\" Rockefeller offered to pay for the publication of the book, but in keeping with AA traditions of being self-supporting, AA rejected the money.\n\nThrough negotiations by his son Nelson, in 1946 he bought for $8.5 million - from the major New York real estate developer William Zeckendorf - the land along the East River in Manhattan which he later donated for the United Nations headquarters. This was after he had vetoed the family estate at Pocantico as a prospective site for the headquarters (see Kykuit). Another UN connection was his early financial support for its predecessor, the League of Nations; this included a gift to endow a major library for the League in Geneva which today still remains a resource for the UN.\n\nA confirmed ecumenicist, over the years he gave substantial sums to Protestant and Baptist institutions, ranging from the Interchurch World Movement, the Federal Council of Churches, the Union Theological Seminary, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York's Riverside Church, and the World Council of Churches. He was also instrumental in the development of the research that led to Robert and Helen Lynd's famous Middletown studies work that was conducted in the city of Muncie, Indiana, that arose out of the financially supported Institute of Social and Religious Research.\n\nAs a follow on to his involvement in the Ludlow Massacre, Rockefeller was a major initiator with his close friend and advisor William Lyon Mackenzie King in the nascent industrial relations movement; along with major chief executives of the time, he incorporated Industrial Relations Counselors (IRC) in 1926, a consulting firm whose main goal was to establish industrial relations as a recognized academic discipline at Princeton University and other institutions. It succeeded through the support of prominent corporate chieftains of the time, such as Owen D. Young and Gerard Swope of General Electric.\n\nIn the 1920s he also donated a substantial amount towards the restoration and rehabilitation of major buildings in France after World War I, such as the Reims Cathedral, the Château de Fontainebleau and the Château de Versailles, for which in 1936 he was awarded France's highest decoration, the Grand-Croix de la Legion d'honneur, which was awarded decades later to his son David Rockefeller.\n\nHe also liberally funded the notable early excavations at Luxor in Egypt, and the American School of Classical Studies for excavation of the Agora and the reconstruction of the Stoa of Attalos, both in Athens; the American Academy in Rome; Lingnan University in China; St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo; the library of the Imperial University in Tokyo; and the Shakespeare Memorial Endowment at Stratford-on-Avon.\n\nIn addition, he provided the funding for the construction of the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem – the Rockefeller Museum – which today houses many antiquities and was the home of many of the Dead Sea Scrolls until they were moved to the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum.\n\nHe had a special interest in conservation, and purchased and donated land for many American National Parks, including Grand Teton (hiding his involvement and intentions behind the Snake River Land Company), Acadia, Great Smoky Mountains, Yosemite, and Shenandoah. In the case of Acadia National Park, he financed and engineered an extensive Carriage Road network throughout the park. Both the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway that connects Yellowstone National Park to the Grand Teton National Park and the Rockefeller Memorial in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were named after him. He was also active in the movement to save redwood trees, making a significant contribution to Save the Redwoods League in the 1920s to enable the purchase of what would become the Rockefeller Forest in Humboldt Redwoods State Park.\n\nIn 1951, he established \"Sleepy Hollow Restorations\", which brought together under one administrative body the management and operation of two historic sites he had acquired: Philipsburg Manor House in North Tarrytown, now called Sleepy Hollow (acquired in 1940 and donated to the Tarrytown Historical Society), and \"Sunnyside\", Washington Irving’s home, acquired in 1945. He bought Van Cortland Manor in Croton-on-Hudson in 1953 and in 1959 donated it to Sleepy Hollow Restorations. In all, he invested more than $12 million in the acquisition and restoration of the three properties that were the core of the organization’s holdings. In 1986, Sleepy Hollow Restorations became \"Historic Hudson Valley\", which also operates the current guided tours of the Rockefeller family estate of Kykuit in Pocantico Hills.\n\nHe is the author of the noted life principle, among others, inscribed on a tablet facing his famed Rockefeller Center: \"I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a duty\".\n\nIn 1935, Rockefeller received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award, \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" He was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1943.\n\nIn August 1900, Rockefeller was invited by the powerful Senator Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich of Rhode Island to join a party aboard President William McKinley's yacht, the USS \"Dolphin\", on a cruise to Cuba. Although the outing was of a political nature, Rockefeller's future wife, philanthropist/socialite Abigail Greene \"Abby\" Aldrich, was included in the large party; the two had first met in the fall of 1894 and had been courting for over four years.\n\nRockefeller married Abby on October 9, 1901, in what was seen at the time as the consummate marriage of capitalism and politics. She was a daughter of Senator Aldrich and Abigail Pearce Truman \"Abby\" Chapman. Moreover, their wedding was the major social event of its time - one of the most lavish of the Gilded Age. It was held at the Aldrich Mansion at Warwick Neck, Rhode Island, and attended by executives of Standard Oil and other companies.\n\nThe couple had six children; Abby in 1903, John III in 1906, Nelson in 1908, Laurance in 1910, Winthrop in 1912, and David in 1915.\n\nAbby died of a heart attack at the family apartment at 740 Park Avenue in April, 1948. Junior remarried in 1951, to Martha Baird, the widow of his old college classmate Arthur Allen. Rockefeller died of pneumonia on May 11, 1960, at the age of 86 in Tucson, Arizona, and was interred in the family cemetery in Tarrytown, with 40 family members present.\n\nHis sons, the five Rockefeller brothers, established an extensive network of social connections and institutional power over time, based on the foundations that Junior - and before him Senior - had laid down. David became a prominent banker, philanthropist and world statesman. Abby and John III became philanthropists. Laurance became a venture capitalist and conservationist. Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller later became state governors; Nelson went on to become Vice President of the United States under President Gerald Ford.\n\nJunior's principal residence in New York was the 9-story mansion at 10 West 54th Street, but he owned a group of properties in this vicinity, including Nos. 4, 12, 14 and 16 (some of these properties had been previously acquired by his father, John D. Rockefeller). After he vacated No. 10 in 1936, these properties were razed and subsequently all the land was gifted to his wife's Museum of Modern Art. In that year he moved into a luxurious 40-room triplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue. In 1953, the real estate developer William Zeckendorf bought the 740 Park Avenue apartment complex and then sold it to Rockefeller, who quickly turned the building into a cooperative, selling it on to his rich neighbors in the building.\n\nYears later, just after his son Nelson become Governor of New York, Rockefeller helped foil a bid by greenmailer Saul Steinberg to take over Chemical Bank. Steinberg bought Junior's apartment for $225,000, $25,000 less than it had cost new in 1929. It has since been called the greatest trophy apartment in New York, in the world's richest apartment building.\n\nIn 1929 Junior was elected an honorary member of the Georgia Society of the Cincinnati. In 1939 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society under statute 12.\n\nThe John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library at Brown University, completed in 1964, is named in his honor.\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a son of George Mason, a Founding Father of the United States, Mason was a scion of the prominent Mason political family.\n\nMason was born on April 4, 1766, at Mattawoman plantation, the estate of his maternal grandparents William Eilbeck and Sarah Edgar Eilbeck. He was eighth child and fifth-eldest son of George Mason IV and his wife Ann Eilbeck. Like his brothers, Mason was tutored at his father's estate, Gunston Hall, in Fairfax County, Virginia. His tutors were Scotsmen Mr. Davidson and Mr. Constable. After the American Revolutionary War, Mason, his brother Thomas, and a cousin, studied with Reverend Buchnan, rector of Aquia and Pohick churches, who resided on Passapatanzy Creek.\n\nMason completed his formal education in mathematics with another Scotsman, Mr. Hunter, in Calvert County, Maryland. He was then apprenticed to a Quaker merchant William Hartshorne of the firm of Harper & Hartshorne in Alexandria, Virginia. Mason accompanied his father George Mason to the Philadelphia Convention, but returned to continue his apprenticeship with Hartshorne before the Convention ended. Mason remained with Hartshorne until spring 1788, when he then entered into a partnership with merchants James and Joseph Fenwick of Maryland.\n\nOn June 22, 1788, Mason travelled to Bordeaux, France to conduct business for Fenwick & Mason firm there. Despite the onset of the French Revolution, Mason remained in France until 1791 and only then left due to his ill health. The Bordeaux branch of Fenwick & Mason continued to thrive, but was liquidated in 1793 because of the encroaching threat of war in Europe. Declining prices of tobacco were also partly to blame for the firm's Bordeaux closure.\n\nBy Spring 1792, Mason had established a branch of Fenwick & Mason in Georgetown. As the firm expanded, it became involved in a variety of other lucrative ventures including bankinging, international commerce, the organization of foundries, and navigation and turnpike companies. Fenwick & Mason also became involved in the flour and wheat trade in addition to its tobacco operations.\n\nMason also served on the board of directors of the Bank of Columbia and became its president in 1798. Around this same time, Mason purchased large tracts of land in the Federal City. His involvement with government service was enhanced through his 1807 appointment as Superintendent of the Indian Trade. Mason held this position until 1816. Mason was the first Commanding General brigadier general of the District of Columbia militia, which is today's District of Columbia National Guard. He was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson on June 28, 1802--a position he would hold until 1811. Through this role, Mason became commissioner general of prisoners during the War of 1812. In 1817, he became the president of the Potomac Company. His nephew Thomson Francis Mason was later chairman of the Alexandria Canal further downstream.\n\nMason acquired Henry Foxall's Foxhall Cannon Foundry in Georgetown in 1815. Mason continued to operate the foundry until his death in 1849. For five years after Mason's death, the foundry remained part of the Mason estate with Mason's son Maynadier Mason as its superintendent.\n\nMason married Anna Maria Murray, daughter of James Murray and his wife Sarah Ennalls Maynadier, in Annapolis, Maryland on February 10, 1796. The couple had ten children:\n\nFollowing Mason's marriage to Anna Maria Murray in 1796, he settled in Georgetown on property located at the corner of present-day 25th and L Streets and Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest. Mason also built a summer residence on Analostan Island (now Theodore Roosevelt Island) on the Potomac River, which became the scene of many elegant social activities in the District of Columbia. Analostan Island had been acquired by George Mason in 1724. Mason inherited the Island from his father upon his death in 1792 and owned it until 1833. The island was famous for its gardens, which were designed and installed by English gardener David Hepburn. Mason continued the operation of the ferry which crossed the Potomac River from Georgetown to the Virginia. After suffering a series of financial setbacks, Mason was forced to give up Analostan Island, and in 1833, the family moved to Clermont in the Cameron Run valley in Fairfax County, Virginia. Mason and his family had already vacated the island in 1831 when a causeway stagnated the water in the Potomac River.\n\nMason died on March 19, 1849, at age 82. His body was interred after March 19, 1849, at Christ Church Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia.\n"}

In that book, he argued that the management of a modern enterprise must serve not only shareholders but all stakeholders (die Interessenten), to achieve long-term growth and prosperity. Schwab has championed the multistakeholder concept since the Forum’s inception. In 2015, the Forum was formally recognised by the Swiss Government as the international organisation for public-private cooperation. Under Schwab's \nleadership, the Forum has been a driver for reconciliation efforts in different parts of the world, acting as a catalyst of numerous collaborations and international initiatives. \n\nIn 1998, Schwab and his wife founded the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, a non-profit organisation based in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nIn 2004, Schwab created a new foundation using the US$1 million prize money from the Dan David Prize he received that year from Israel. The Forum of Young Global Leaders aims to bring together over 500 people under 40 from all walks (areas) of life who have demonstrated their commitment to improving the state of the world, and encourage them to work together over the span of five years to identify and realise global pro-social and pro-capitalist change.\n\nIn 2011, he founded the Global Shapers Community, a global network of local communities, or \"hubs\", of young people aged 20 to 30 who are exceptional in their potential, achievements and drive to make a contribute to their communities. , there are 459 Hubs with more than 6,216 Shapers.\n\nSchwab holds a doctorate in Economics (\"summa cum laude\") from the University of Fribourg, a doctorate in Engineering from the ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) and a Master of Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Additionally, he has been the recipient of over a dozen honorary doctorates, and is an honorary professor of the Ben-Gurion University of Israel and the China Foreign Affairs University.\n\nSchwab was professor of business policy at the University of Geneva from 1972 to 2002. Since 1979, he has published the \"Global Competitiveness Report\", an annual report assessing the potential for increasing productivity and economic growth of countries around the world, written by a team of economists. The report is based on a methodology developed by Schwab, measuring competitiveness not only in terms of productivity but also based on sustainability criteria.\n\nHe is the author of several books, including \"The Fourth Industrial Revolution\" (2016).\n\nFrom 1993-1995, Schwab was a member of the UN High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development. From 1996-1998, he was Vice-Chairman of the UN Committee for Development Planning.\nHe also exercised a number of functions in the global public interest, such as being a member of The Peres Centre for Peace and a member of the board of the Lucerne Festival. During the earlier years of his career, he was on a number of company boards, such as The Swatch Group, The Daily Mail Group, and Vontobel Holding. He is a former member of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group.\n\nSchwab warned the refugee crisis could be a precursor to something much bigger, saying \"As the crash in commodities prices spreads economic woe across the developing world, Europe could face a wave of migration that will eclipse today’s refugee crisis.\" \"Look how many countries in Africa, for example, depend on the income from oil exports,\" Schwab said in an interview ahead of the WEF’s 46th annual meeting, in the Swiss resort of Davos. \"Now imagine 1 billion inhabitants, imagine they all move north.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1980s, he emigrated to the United States and made a living working in show business as a piano player while traveling throughout the country. He also worked in several Caribbean cruising companies until the death of his father. Farkas then returned to Chile to manage the family business. He has stakes in several industries, the mining sector being the most important.\n\nIn October 2008 Farkas announced that he was considering being an independent candidate for the presidential election of 2009. Initially, he declined to comment on the issue. However, on December 5, he announced he would not be running.\n\nFarkas is widely known in Chile by his appearances in the Teletón (Chilean telethon), a fundraising campaign for handicapped children. Farkas donated hundreds of millions of pesos, and in 2008, donated 1 billion pesos (approx. US$2 million), becoming the first individual to donate such amount of money to this campaign (matched hours later by José Luis Nazar during the same event).\n\nFarkas has been very critical of the Chilean upper class, stating that “they’re usually very stingy and elitist” and don’t do enough to mitigate Chile’s social problems. He has also said that if elected president “all Chileans would have their own house”. This rhetoric of appealing to the masses of poor people has gained him substantial support among that social group and some harsh criticism from his business peers and local politicians, often labeling him as a “populist” in search of some spotlight.\n\nDuring the rescue operation in Copiapó, Chile of the trapped miners, Farkas donated $10,000 to each of the 33 rescued men. Farkas reportedly gave checks in the miners' names to each of the families and set up a separate fund to collect donations.\n\nOn July 1, 2011, Farkas was given an award by the Viña del Mar Mayor for his contributions to the city.\n\nOn February 7, 2018, Farkas offered a reward of 10 million Chilean pesos for anyone who found Emmelyn Catalina Cañales Vidal, an 11-year-old girl who was kidnapped in Licantén, Chile.\n\nFarkas is also known as a patron of many other charities, including the March of the Living an annual educational program which brings students from all over the world to Poland, to study the history of the Holocaust and examine the roots of prejudice, intolerance and hate.\n\nAccording to a study, coordinated by Magdalena Aninat, director of the \"Centro de Filantropía e Inversiones Sociales\" (Cefis) of the \"Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez (UAI)\", which investigated the philanthropy and social investments of Chilean companies, concluded that \"Farkas is an actor that it is pushing others and acting as a 'role of conscience.' It has a very interesting role to make visible a more American model of the success of the business world, where that success closes with returning the hand to society. In Chile we are not used to making donations visible, but Farkas is constantly challenging the business world to be present and that is positive,\" said the UAI academic.\n\nIn 2014, with the support of Leonardo Farkas, March of the Living marked the 70th anniversary of the destruction of Hungarian Jewry at the hands of the Nazis in 1944 during World War II. On Holocaust Remembrance Day, at the close of the memorial ceremony on the actual grounds of Auschwitz-Birkenau, a number of Holocaust survivors - many whose relatives perished in the infamous death camp - joined Leonardo Farkas in the writing of the last letters of a Torah. The Torah was donated to the March of the Living by Mr. Farkas, whose philanthropy also enabled students and survivors to take part in the March of the Living.\n\nIn 2014, Leonardo donated the seven newly written Sefer Torah sent to six different continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. Farkas has a great passion for dedicating \"Happy Torahs\", as he refers to them, which will be used in places with a great need. Over the years, he donated many Sefer Torahs to the Chabad-Lubavitch hassidic Jewish organization and other institutions around the world.\n"}
{"id": "43527605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43527605", "title": "List of government-owned companies", "text": "List of government-owned companies\n\nThis is a list of government-owned companies. A government-owned corporation is a legal entity that undertakes commercial activities on behalf of an owner government. Their legal status varies from being a part of government to stock companies with a state as a regular stockholder. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and that they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non-financial objectives.\n\nIn 2009, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan formed the Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF) as a \"state owned enterprise\" subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. By Presidential Decree, the APPF is mandated to replace all non-diplomatic private security companies by 20 March 2013 to become the sole provider of pay-for-service security contracts within Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nDefence Housing Australia\n\n\n\n\nRegion of Wallonia owns the:\n\n\nState-owner enterprises are divided into public enterprises (\"empresa pública\") and mixed-economy companies (\"sociedade de economia mista\"). The public enterprises are subdivided into two categories: individual – with its own assets and capital owned by the Union – and plural companies – whose assets are owned by multiple government agencies and the Union, which have the majority of the voting interest. Caixa Econômica Federal, Correios, Embrapa, and BNDES are examples of public enterprises. Mixed-economy companies are enterprises with the majority of stocks owned by the government, but that also have stocks owned by the private sector and usually have their shares traded on stock exchanges. Banco do Brasil, Petrobras, Sabesp, and Eletrobras are examples of mixed-economy companies.\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the central government of Brazil launched a privatization program inspired by the Washington Consensus. State-owned enterprises such as Vale do Rio Doce, Telebrás, CSN, and Usiminas (most of them mixed-economy companies) were transferred to the private sector as part of this policy.\n\nBrasil State Owned Companies Fact Sheet / Download from the planejamento.gov.br website.\n\n\n\nIn Canada, state-owned corporations are referred to as \"Crown corporations\", indicating that an organization is established by law, owned by the sovereign (either in right of Canada or a province), and overseen by parliament and cabinet. Examples of federal Crown corporations include:\nMinisters of the Crown often control the shares in such public corporations, while parliament both sets out the laws that create and bind Crown corporations and sets their annual budgets.\n\nForeign SOEs are welcome to invest in Canada: in Fall 2013, British Columbia and Alberta signed agreements overseas to promote foreign direct investment in Canada. The Investment Canada Act governs this area federally. Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated in 2013 that the \"government [needs] to exercise its judgement\" over SOEs.\n\nSaskatchewan has maintained the largest number of Crown corporations, including\n\nCrown corporations of British Columbia include\n\nIn Ontario:\nIn Quebec:\n\nPrivatization, or the selling of Crown corporations to private interests, has become common throughout Canada over the past 30 years. Petro-Canada, Canadian National Railway, and Air Canada are examples of former federal Crown corporations that have been privatized. Privatized provincial Crown corporations include Alberta Government Telephones (which merged with privately owned BC Tel to form Telus), BCRIC, Manitoba Telecom Services, Saskatchewan Oil & Gas Corporation and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.\n\nAfter 1949, all business entities in the People's Republic of China were created and owned by the government. In the late 1980s, the government began to reform the state-owned enterprise, and during the 1990s and 2000s, many mid-sized and small sized state-owned enterprises were privatized and went public. There are a number of different corporate forms which result in a mixture of public and private capital. In PRC terminology, a state-owned enterprise refers to a particular corporate form, which is increasingly being replaced by the listed company. State-owned enterprises are mostly governed by both local governments' SASAC and, in the central government, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council. However, some state-owned enterprise were governed by China Investment Corporation (and its domestic arm Central Huijin Investment), as well as under the governance of Ministry of Education for the university-run enterprises, or some financial institutes that were under the governance of the Ministry of Finance.\n\nAs of 2011, 35% of business activity and 43% of profits in the People's Republic of China resulted from companies in which the state owned a majority interest. Critics, such as \"The New York Times\", have alleged that China's state-owned companies are a vehicle for corruption by the families of ruling party leaders who have sometimes amassed fortunes while managing them. \n\nIn the postwar years, Hong Kong's colonial government operated under a laissez-faire economic philosophy called positive non-interventionism. Hence Crown corporations did not play as significant a role in the development of the territory as in many other British territories.\n\nThe MTR Corporation (MTR) was formed as a Crown corporation, mandated to operate under \"prudent commercial principles\", in 1975. The Kowloon-Canton Railway, operated under a government department, was corporatised in 1982 to imitate the success of MTR (see Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation). MTR was privatised in 2000 although the Hong Kong Government is still the majority shareholder. KCR was operationally merged with MTR in 2007.\n\nExamples of present-day statutory bodies include the Airport Authority, responsible for running the Hong Kong International Airport, or the Housing Authority, which provides housing to about half of Hong Kong residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn India, a state-owned enterprise is termed a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) or a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE). These companies are owned by the Union Government, or one of the many state or territorial governments, or both. The company equity needs to be majority owned by the government to be a PSU. Few examples are Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Engineers India Limited, India Trade Promotion Organization, GAIL, BSNL, Food Corporation of India, Air India etc.\n\n\n\nCompanies owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finances\n\nIn Japan, Japan Post was reorganized into Japan Post Group in 2007 as a material step of the postal privatization. It ceased to be wholly owned by the government on November 4, 2015 when the government listed 11% of its holdings on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Japan Railways Group (JR), Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and Japan Tobacco (JT) were formerly owned by the government.\n\n\nParastatals in Kenya, partly from a lack of expertise and endemic corruption, have largely inhibited economic development. In 1979, a presidential commission went as far as saying that they constituted \"a serious threat to the economy\", and, by 1989, they had still not furthered industrialization or fostered the development of a Black business class.\n\nSeveral Kenyan SOEs have been privatized since the 1980s, with mixed results.\n\nThere are many state-owned enterprises in South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealanders commonly refer to their state-owned enterprises as \"SOEs\", or as \"crown entities\". Local government councils and similar authorities also set up locally controlled enterprises, such as water-supply companies and \"local-authority trading enterprises\" (LATEs) as separate corporations or as business units of the councils concerned.\n\nGovernment-owned businesses designated as crown entities include:\n\nNew Zealand's state-owned enterprises have included:\n\nState-owned enterprises which have undergone privatisation and subsequent renationalisation:\n\n\n\nPakistan has a large list of government owned companies called State owned entities (SOEs). These SOEs played an important role in the development of the business and industry in Pakistan however recently they are considered responsible for fiscal difficulties to the government due to corruption and bad governance. These SOEs, roughly 190 in number are operating in wide range of economic areas including Energy, communication, transport, shipping, trading, banking and finance etc.\n\nIn the Philippines, state-owned enterprises are known as government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs). They can range from the Social Security System (SSS) and the Philippine Coconut Authority with no counterparts in the private sector, to Land Bank of the Philippines, a wholly government-owned bank that competes with private banks. A number of government-owned and controlled corporations, especially those that were seized by the Late Dictator Ferdinand Marcos during his time as the leader of the Republic of the Philippines, were given back to the original owners by the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, including Philippine Airlines (PAL), Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), Philippine National Bank (PNB), ABS-CBN among others.\n\n\n\nThe state of Romania owns a minority stake in:\n\n\n\nGovernment-linked corporations play a substantial role in Singapore's domestic economy. These GLCs are partially or fully owned by a state-owned investment company, Temasek Holdings. As of November 2011, the top six Singapore-listed GLCs accounted for about 17% of total capitalization of the Singapore Exchange (SGX). Notable GLCs include Singapore Airlines, SingTel, ST Engineering, and MediaCorp.\n\nSlovenia is an ex-Yugoslavian republic. As such, its economy was largely state-owned prior to dissolution of that federation. The state still owns many enterprises, such as the banks, which in turn own such businesses as supermarkets and newspapers.\n\n\nTwo types: Government-owned companies, which legally are normal companies but mainly or fully national owned. They are expected to be funded by their sales. A big customer might be the government or a government agency. The other type is Government agencies which might also do activities competing with private owned companies. They usually are funded by tax money but can also sell services. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition, and a wish to have market economy instead of plan economy as much as possible. Based on the tradition of avoiding \"ministerial rule\", the government has avoided interfering with the business of the companies, and allowed them to go international.\n\nThe Government of Tanzania owns a number of commercial enterprises in the country via the Treasury Registrar. It wholly owns the following corporations unless indicated otherwise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

When Rafiq Hariri drew up plans to rebuild a war-shattered Lebanon, MEED met the prime minister and asked him to explain them. When Colonel Gaddafi unveiled the first part of his Great Manmade River, MEED took a front-row seat at the ceremony and quizzed the engineers. While US tanks were still rolling towards Baghdad in March 2003, MEED obtained plans from Washington that described how the US was hoping to rebuild the country. Three months before going public, MEED revealed DP World's IPO plans. Abdalla el-Badri announced Opec's potential move from US dollar to euro pricing to MEED. MEED broke news of Saudi Arabia moving ahead with plans for a Mile-High Tower in Jeddah – which would make it the tallest tower in the world – and Nakheel's plans to create a tower over one kilometre high (then called Nakheel Tower, later announced as Dubai's Harbour Tower) to trump Emaar's Burj Khalifa.\n\nMEED is used as a source of Middle East information by the US and British governments – Energy Information Administration, United States Congress and the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nThe dedication made by Abdullah II of Jordan in 2007 demonstrates MEED's positive contribution to the Middle East for over 50 years. \"The celebration of this milestone is a testament to the distinguished insight into the region MEED has provided to its readers for five decades.

She also helped to establish the Council for the Advancement of Arab British Understanding (CAABU).\n\nWith two part-time secretarial assistants, MEED was produced on a hand-cranked Ronco printing machine. Every Friday evening, friends and relatives would help staple and stuff envelopes with the 12-page newsletter. Lacking any editorial resources, the Middle East Economic Digest was a compilation from newspapers and other reports. Newspapers were flown in weekly from Cairo and Beirut, translated and condensed.\n\nBy the time MEED was acquired by Emap in 1986, it had a staff of 20 full-time journalists and 12 researchers and newsroom assistants to cover Middle Eastern business and project news.

The name is a portmanteau of \"Oakland\" and \"Amsterdam,\" the capital of the Netherlands, where marijuana is semi-legal. Founded in 2007, and located in the heart of Oakland, Oaksterdam University is the nation's first cannabis college. The school's mission is to provide quality training for the cannabis industry. Those interested in learning more about this emerging industry should learn to do so safely and responsibly in accordance with the law. At Oaksterdam University, state vs. federal law is the first class you are taught, in an effort to help you understand the law before you are taught anything else. The faculty at Oaksterdam University encompasses some of the most prominent names in the industry. Many of the faculty members not only helped write state law but also took medical marijuana cases to the Supreme Court. Oaksterdam University continues to educate, retaining its support from the city of Oakland.\n\nSince 2005, cannabis has been available to patients with patient identification and physician recommendation at a busy dispensary in the neighborhood, one of Oakland's four officially licensed dispensaries under the current municipal ordinance. According to Proposition 215, a statewide voter initiative which amended the California Health and Safety Code, marijuana used for medical purposes is legal to possess, cultivate and donate for. Dispensaries require a doctor's note in order to obtain medical cannabis, which is legal under California Law but illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act.\n\nThe name \"Oaksterdam\" is a combination of \"Oakland\" and \"Amsterdam\", the Dutch city that is famously tolerant towards cannabis use. The term was coined by the late Jim McClelland, an AIDS patient who was a founding member of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Club and the Berkeley Patients Group after prompting by Andrew Glazier, a fellow activist, that the neighborhood needed a name.\nThe history of Oaksterdam started with Oakland Buyers Cooperative Distributing to Prop 215 patients with acts of courage mixed with legal wrangling they stayed open until the federal authorities became an issue. After the federal authorities ordered the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Cooperative (OCBC) to shut down, a few OCBC members (like the late Jim McClelland and late Tim Sidwell) went around the corner and opened up The Zoo. The Zoo was a well stocked dispensary with deals that had clones as well as advice on how to cultivate. Soon after that a proliferation of clubs opened like The Bulldog, Compassionate Caregivers, The Lemon Drop, Oakland Patients Group, and 420 Cafe.\n\nDan Lundgren went on a political warpath after Prop 215 was passed. Dennis Peron was arrested and San Francisco's safe source of medical cannabis was shut down. The Oakland City Council made a few proclamations then promptly made a few patients official medical cannabis officers like Jeff Jones and Ed Rosenthal as well as approve the distribution of medical cannabis as per Proposition 215. The Oakland Politicians were pro cannabis before Prop 215 and allowed a couple of groups to distribute. The Federal authorities however have continued to harass even though the Attorney General Eric Holder has stated publicly that the prosecution of medical cannabis is the federal authorities last priority.\n\nOn April 2, 2012 the IRS raided Oaksterdam University. Oaksterdam University continued to put on classes less than 2 days later. Incorrect reports often cite that the event was conducted by the DEA. No charges have been filed. Harborside has been also threatened as well.\nSteve DeAngelo spoke out against the raids and the IRS threats and vowed to serve the patients and reminded us about the patients locked up in jail. The DEA is systematically trying to destroy the medical cannabis community. \nMelinda Haag the DEA prosecutor has been threatening the city sanctioned dispensaries with closure. The IRS has taken away the standard deduction claiming that the medical cannabis community is a criminal enterprise.\nRichard Lee dissolved his interest in his businesses, paving the way for a new generation of leadership.\n\nOaksterdam is located on the north end of downtown Oakland, between downtown proper, the Lakeside and the Financial District. It is roughly bordered by 14th Street on the southwest, Harrison Street on the southeast, 19th Street on the northeast, and Telegraph Ave on the northwest. It is characterized by mixed-use office and residential buildings with unique historic architecture that is older than some of the more modern skyscrapers south of 14th Street, and an abundance of ground floor retail shop spaces, restaurants and cafes.\n\nA Julia Morgan-designed building is located at the northwest corner of 15th and Webster Streets, which was the original location of the Oakland YWCA. The neighborhood also features the Cathedral Building, an ornate, historic Flatiron Building at Latham Square at the intersection of Broadway and Telegraph.\n\nThe district features at least two institutions of higher learning, Lincoln University at 15th and Franklin, a small business school catering mainly to international students, and Oaksterdam University located at 1734 Telegraph Avenue, a business college which prepares students for careers in the cannabis industry. \nOaksterdam University was raided by the DEA on April 2, 2012 and they performed a smash and grab.\n\nThe 19th Street BART metrorail station is located beneath Oaksterdam on Broadway between 17th and 20th Streets. The station has entrances on Broadway and on a pedestrian plaza that opens onto Telegraph Avenue. AC Transit also recently opened the Uptown regional transit center nearby on Thomas L. Berkley Way (20th Street), which features multiple bus shelters with seating, NextBus arrival prediction signs, and Rapid Bus service.\n\nA bicycle rental service has opened in the neighborhood on 15th Street, serving one of the only bicycle rental stores in the area. The bike shop incorporates a glass-blowing school.\n\nRecently a pedi-cab service (Oaksterkabs) was opened, staffed by a single cycle rickshaw. Now dubbed \"The Cannabis Cruiser\", the pedicab offers its services around the downtown area to students of Oaksterdam University, Oaksterdam employees and to pedestrians in general.\n\nThe district is home to a number of coffee shops, a tea shop and hydroponic supply store, cafes, restaurants open into the evenings, a gift shop, two musical instrument stores and specialty stores. These shops and services also are attractive to cannabis tourists and enjoy a superior central location next to the 19th Street BART station and AC Transit connections.\n\nSince legislative changes passed by the Oakland City Council in 2005, there is no longer a proliferation of cannabis dispensaries in the neighborhood as was the case for several years previously. Most of these dispensaries had the chance to obtain non-profit status; some chose to not become non-profit and were no longer permitted to dispense cannabis. Under current legislation, there are four officially permitted dispensaries in the City of Oakland. One of the four permits is held by a dispensary cafe in the neighborhood.\n\n\"Measure Z\" (as of 2014, Measure Z referred to a new Oakland public safety ballot measure instead) clubs are businesses that sell cannabis to people over the age of 18. One private club in Oaksterdam sells cannabis and food containing cannabis to adults who do not hold valid physician recommendations for medical marijuana, which are needed to obtain county-issued patient identification cards in California. One such club is named after Oakland's Measure Z, a city ballot initiative which makes the private sales, cultivation, and possession of cannabis the lowest police priority and mandates that the City of Oakland tax and regulate cannabis as soon as possible under state law.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Oaksterdam University founder Richard Lee published the \"Oaksterdam News\", a quarterly newsprint periodical covering news in the California cannabis movement, with a circulation of 100,000. In 2008, Lee went on to found \"West Coast Cannabis\" (edited by author and activist Ngaio Bealum), which covers similar news stories as the \"Oaksterdam News\" in magazine format; \"Oaksterdam News\" editor Chris Conrad went on to found the \"West Coast Leaf\" that same year, with his wife Mikki Norris, which ran with a circulation of 175,000 until 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

Operational Excellence is evidenced by results. Given two companies with the same strategy, the Operationally Excellent company will have lower operational risk, lower operating costs, and increased revenues relative to its competitors, creating value for customers and shareholders. It may more simply be interpreted as \"Execution Excellence.\"\n\nSome interpretations of this management philosophy are based on earlier continuous improvement methodologies, such as Lean Thinking, Six Sigma, OKAPI and Scientific Management. However, the focus of Operational Excellence goes beyond the traditional event-based model of improvement toward a long-term change in organizational culture. Companies in pursuit of Operational Excellence do two things significantly differently than other companies: they manage their business and operational processes systematically and invest in developing the right culture.\n\nOperational Excellence manifests itself through integrated performance across revenue, cost, and risk. It focuses on meeting customer expectation through the continuous improvement of the operational processes and the culture of the organization.\n\nThere are two components fundamental to Operational Excellence: an integrated Management system (IMS) and a culture of Operational Discipline. \n\nThe first component, the IMS, consists of a framework of processes and standards that define where the company is going, identify the risks to getting there, mitigate them, manage change, and continuously improve. Having one single, integrated management system reduces overlap, redundancy, and conflict. Early adopters of this practice have been companies such as Exxon and Chevron utilizing Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) and Operations Excellence Management Systems (OEMS), respectively. \n\nThe second component, a culture of Operational Discipline, is commonly described as doing the right thing, the right way, every time. This culture is built upon five guiding principles developed from the United States Nuclear Navy, a high reliability organization. Those principles are integrity, questioning attitude, level of knowledge, watch team backup, and formality. These values are used to identify the behaviors expected of each and every employee and how they support the organization's mission and outcomes. \n\nThe Shingo Prize, an organization that recognizes success in the discipline, has identified ten key principles its award winners display:\n\n\nThe OKAPI method was created by Organizational Intelligence experts Iris Tsidon and Maya Gal. Their system incorporates the use of a methodology of SMART KPIs (key performance indicators).\n\n\nThe OKAPI method identifies the main challenges facing companies striving for operational excellence:\n\n\nAlso known as PBED (Plan-Brief-Execute-Debrief) the FLEX methodology is an iterative IMS designed by fighter pilots to achieve operational excellence in combat, the methodology was adapted to a business practice in 1998. Elements of the methodology are utilised in the agile manifesto commonly used by software developers. As an iterative process it values adaptation of strategy to real world influences through the practice of debriefing. Debriefing is a tool utilised by organisations to drive cultural change, specifically \"Nameless and Rankless\" where who are and what your position is in an organisation is irrelevant when assessing results and developing solutions:\n\n1. Set a clear, measurable and achievable team objective aligned to your HDD (alignment of the organisation)\n2. Identify the threats and risks to achieving the objective (define to problem)\n3. Identify the resources required to mitigate the threats (define the cost)\n4. Apply lessons learned (*this is the key step for this method, taking a lesson from a debrief and applying it to the plan)\n5. Develop individual objectives and tasks that align to the team objective (accountability)\n6. Contingency plan. (three simple steps to recover from a major disruption)\n\nPhilosophically individuals practising Operational Excellence within an organisation should champion simplicity over complexity. In practice this should see the self awareness exhibited around errors and mistakes in decision making be rewarded, on the basis the lesson is learned and applied, leading to continuous improvement of day to day practice and end result.\n\n\n"}

Shortly after the uprising of the Nazis in the government, he fled and wandered as a refugee around Europe.\n\nHe later moved to Japan. In 1941, he married a local woman. During World War II he worked with industrial factories, associating with the Axis Power countries. After the war ended, he began working with American businesses, importing iron products for the Japanese steel industry, when at the same time exporting a variety of Japanese-made products to India.\n\nAt the start of the 1950s, Eisenberg expanded his business to other countries in the Far East, especially South Korea, where he invested money while mediating between the local authority to manufacturers from the East that were also doing business there. Among them were: British Electric, Siemens, MAN SE, and Fiat Automobiles. Within a decade, he managed to mediate a vast variety of projects, such as developing production lines for recycled paper and purchasing airplanes and trains. He got an award from the Korean government for his actions. Until the mid-1960s, Eisenberg was the primary factor and catalyst in the commerce between South Korea and Japan to Western countries. He got high brokerage commissions, and therefore a few of which led to local and international scandals.\n\nEisenberg founded the company Israel Corporation, and a new law was enacted for him, allowing the company to have a tax break for 30 years. The law, which got its nickname from Eisenberg, was meant to encourage entrepreneurs. Upon getting these benefits, Eisenberg began mimicking his international actions and do them in Israel as well, which led him to settle in Savyon, Israel. With Israel Corporation he began purchasing some holdings in the companies Zim Integrated Shipping Services, Oil Refineries, and others.\n\nAt the same time he took advantage of his connections to do militant transactions between the Far East and Israel, and also became an exporter of weapons from Israel to countries in Africa and South America. Later on he was the first person to do commercial business between Israel and China. Eisenberg is considered a significant donor to political parties, influencing the Israeli politics.\n\nIn 1979, Eisenberg founded \"Beit Asia\" in Tel Aviv, which he also got special tax-cuts for, where he located his stock market investments' headquarter, owned by Eisenberg’s Group. Jonathan Zohovsky, his daughter’s husband, as well as Michael Albin, who was the manager of the group, assisted him. After the Israeli 1983 stock market crash, the group had significant losses, and later on the police found that the company had been hiding information from its stockholders and Albin was found guilty. He later died in tragic reasons, and Eisenberg disconnected his relationship with his daughter and her husband. In the 1990s, his business activity began to slow down, due to involvement of other markets in the Far East and other factors. Eisenberg died in Beijing in 1997, two years before the expiration of the Eisenberg Law.\n\nEisenberg's brother, Refael, who was a Hasidic scholar, died in 1976, leaving twelve children behind him.\n"}

{"id": "26775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26775", "title": "Syndicalism", "text": "Syndicalism\n\nSyndicalism is a radical current in the labor movement, and was most active in the early 20th century. According to the Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, it predominated the revolutionary left in the decade preceding World War I, as Marxism was mostly reformist at that time.\n\nMajor syndicalist organizations included the General Confederation of Labor in France, the National Confederation of Labor in Spain, the Italian Syndicalist Union, the Free Workers' Union of Germany, and the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation. The Industrial Workers of the World, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, and the Canadian One Big Union, though they did not regard themselves as syndicalists, are considered by most historians to belong to this current. A number of syndicalist organizations were, and still are to this day, linked in the International Workers' Association.\n\nThe term \"syndicalism\" has French origins. In French, a \"syndicat\" is a trade union, usually a local union. The corresponding words in Spanish and Portuguese, \"sindicato\", and Italian, \"sindacato\", are similar. By extension, the French \"syndicalisme\" refers to trade unionism in general. The concept \"syndicalisme révolutionnaire\" or \"revolutionary syndicalism\" emerged in French socialist journals in 1903 and the French General Confederation of Labor (\"Confédération générale du travail\", CGT) came to use the term to describe its brand of unionism. \"Revolutionary syndicalism\", or more commonly \"syndicalism\" with the \"revolutionary\" implied, was then adapted to a number of languages by unionists following the French model.\n\nMany scholars, including Darlington, Marcel van der Linden, and Wayne Thorpe, apply the term \"syndicalism\" to a number of organizations or currents within the labor movement that did not identify as \"syndicalist\". They apply the label to one big unionists or industrial unionists in North America and Australia, Larkinists in Ireland, and groups that identify as revolutionary industrialists, revolutionary unionists, anarcho-syndicalists, or councilists. This includes the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in the United States, for example, which claimed its industrial unionism was \"a higher type of revolutionary labor organization than that proposed by the syndicalists\". Van der Linden and Thorpe use \"syndicalism\" to refer to \"all revolutionary, direct-actionist organizatons\". Darlington proposes that syndicalism be defined as \"revolutionary trade unionism\". He and van der Linden argue that it is justified to group together such a wide range of organizations because their similar modes of action or practice outweigh their ideological differences.\n\nOthers, like Larry Peterson and Erik Olssen, disagree with this broad definition. According to Olssen, this understanding has a \"tendency to blur the distinctions between industrial unionism, syndicalism, and revolutionary socialism\". Peterson gives a more restrictive definition of \"syndicalism\" based on five criteria: \nThis definition excludes the IWW and the Canadian One Big Union (OBU). Peterson proposes the broader category \"revolutionary industrial unionism\" to encompass syndicalism, groups like the IWW and the OBU, and others. The defining commonality between these groups is that they sought to unite all workers in a general organization.\n\nSyndicalism originated in France and spread from there. The French CGT was the model and inspiration for syndicalist groups throughout Europe and the world. Revolutionary industrial unionism, part of syndicalism in the broader sense, originated with the IWW in the United States and then caught on in other countries. In a number of countries, however, certain syndicalist practices and ideas predate the coining of the term in France or the founding of the IWW. In Bert Altena's view, a number of movements in Europe can be called syndicalist, even before 1900. According to the English social historian E.P. Thompson and the anarcho-syndicalist theorist Rudolf Rocker, there were syndicalist tendencies in Britain's labor movement as early as the 1830s. Syndicalists saw themselves as the heirs of the First International, the international socialist organization formed in 1864, particularly its anti-authoritarian wing led by Mikhail Bakunin. Bakunin and his followers advocated the general strike, rejected electoral politics, and anticipated workers' organizations replacing rule by the state. According to Lucien van der Walt, the Spanish section of the First International, formed in 1870, was in fact syndicalist. Kenyon Zimmer sees a \"proto-syndicalism\" in the influence the anarchist-led International Working People's Association (IWPA) and Central Labor Union, which originated in the American section of the First International, had in the Chicago labor movement of the 1880s. They were involved in the nationwide struggle for an eight-hour day. On May 3, 1886, the police killed three striking workers at a demonstration in Chicago. Seven policemen and four workers were killed the following day when someone, possibly an IWPA member, threw a bomb at the police. Four anarchists were eventually executed for allegedly conspiring with the man who threw the bomb. The Haymarket Affair, as these events become known, led anarchists and labor organizers, including syndicalists, in both the United States and Europe to re-evaluate the revolutionary meaning of the general strike.\n\nAccording to Émile Pouget, a French anarchist and CGT leader, from \"the United States, the idea of the general strike fertilized by the blood of anarchists hanged in Chicago [...] was imported to France\". In the 1890s, French anarchists, conceding that individual action such as assassinations had failed, turned their focus to the labor movement. They were able to gain influence, particularly in the \"bourses du travail\", which served as labor exchanges, meeting places for unions, and trades councils and organized in a national federation in 1893. In 1895, the CGT was formed as a rival to the \"bourses\", but was at first much weaker. From the start, it advocated the general strike and aimed to unite all workers. Pouget, who was active in the CGT, supported the use of sabotage and direct action. In 1902, the \"bourses\" merged into the CGT. In 1906, the federation adopted the Charter of Amiens, which reaffirmed the CGT's independence from party politics and fixed the goal of uniting all French workers.\n\nIn 1905, the Industrial Workers of the World were formed in the United States by the Western Federation of Miners, the American Labor Union, and a broad coalition of socialists, anarchists, and labor unionists. Its base was mostly in the Western US where labor conflicts were most violent and workers therefore radicalized. Although Wobblies insisted their union was a distinctly American form of labor organization and not an import of European syndicalism, the IWW was syndicalist in the broader sense of the word. According to Melvyn Dubofsky and most other IWW historians, the IWW's industrial unionism was the specifically American form of syndicalism. Nevertheless, the IWW also had a presence in Canada and Mexico nearly from its inception, as the US economy and labor force was intertwined with those countries.\nFrench syndicalism and American industrial unionism influenced the rise of syndicalism elsewhere. Syndicalist movements and organizations in a number of countries were established by activists who had spent time in France. Ervin Szabó visited Paris in 1904 and then established a Syndicalist Propaganda Group in his native Hungary in 1910. Several of the founders of the Spanish CNT had visited France. Alceste de Ambris and Armando Borghi, both leaders in Italy's USI, were in Paris for a few months from 1910 to 1911. French influence also spread through publications. Emile Pouget's pamphlets could be read in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, German, and Swedish translations. Journals and newspapers in a number of countries advocated syndicalism. For example, \" L'Action directe\", a journal mainly for miners in Charleroi, Belgium, urged its readers to follow \"the example of our confederated friends of France\". The IWW's newspapers published articles on French syndicalism, particularly the tactic of sabotage and the CGT's \"La Vie Ouvrière\" carried articles about Britain's labor movement by the British syndicalist Tom Mann. Migration played a key role in spreading syndicalist ideas. The Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (\"Federación Obrera Regional Argentina\", FORA), openly anarchist by 1905, was formed by Italian and Spanish immigrants in 1901. Many IWW leaders were European immigrants, including Edmondo Rossoni who moved between the United States and Italy and was active in both the IWW and USI. International work processes also contributed to the diffusion of syndicalism. For example, sailors helped establish IWW presences in port cities around the world.\n\nSyndicalists formed different kinds of organizations. Some, like the French radicals, worked within existing unions to infuse them with their revolutionary spirit. Some found existing unions entirely unsuitable and built federations of their own, a strategy known as \"dual unionism\". American syndicalists formed the IWW, though William Z. Foster later abandoned the IWW after a trip to France and set up the Syndicalist League of North America (SLNA), which sought to radicalize the established American Federation of Labor (AFL). In Ireland, the ITGWU broke away from a more moderate, and British-based, union. In Italy and Spain, syndicalists initially worked within the established union confederations before breaking away and forming USI and the CNT respectively. In Norway, there were both the Norwegian Trade Union Opposition (\"Norske Fagopposition\", NFO), syndicalists working within the mainstream Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (\"Landsorganisasjonen i Norge\" in Norwegian, LO), and the Norwegian Syndicalist Federation (\"Norsk Syndikalistik Federation\" in Norwegian, NSF), an independent syndicalist organization set up by the Swedish SAC. In Britain, there was a similar conflict between ISEL and the local IWW organization.\n\nBy 1914, there were syndicalist national labor confederations in Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Italy, and France, while Belgian syndicalists were in the process of forming one. There were also groups advocating syndicalism in Russia, Japan, the United States, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, and Great Britain. Outside of North America, the IWW also had organizations in Australia, New Zealand, where it was part of the Federation of Labour (FOL), Great Britain, though its membership had imploded by 1913, and South Africa. In Ireland, syndicalism took the form of the ITGWU, which espoused a mix of industrial unionism and socialist republicanism, and was labeled Larkinism.\n\nScholars have given several explanations for the emergence of syndicalism. Werner Sombart, a German economist and sociologist, commenting in 1905, ascribes the rise of syndicalism to the Italian and particularly the French mentality. He writes: \"The only people who could possibly act up to such a system of teaching are Frenchmen and Italians. They are generally men who do things impulsively [...], who are seized upon by a sudden passionate enthusiasm [...], but they have little application, perseverance, calm or steadiness.\"\n\nThere was a significant uptick in workers' radicalism in most developed capitalist countries from 1911 to 1922, though they relented during World War I. Strikes increased in frequency, numbers of workers involved, and duration. According to van der Linden and Thorpe, syndicalism was only one way this radicalization expressed itself. In the United Kingdom, for example, the period from 1910 to 1914 became known as the Great Labour Unrest. Many historians see syndicalism as a consequence of this unrest, but Elie Halévy and the politician Lord Robert Cecil claim it was its cause. Employers in France likewise blamed an upsurge in workers' militancy in the same period on syndicalist leaders. Syndicalism was further encouraged by employers' hostility to workers' actions.\n\nAccording to van der Linden and Thorpe, workers' radicalization manifested itself in their rejection of the dominant strategies in the, mostly socialist, labor movement, which was led by reformist trade unions and socialist parties. Lenin posited that \"revolutionary syndicalism in many countries was a direct and inevitable result of opportunism, reformism and parliamentary cretinism.\" A feeling that ideological disputes were draining workers' power led Dutch, French, and American syndicalist organizations to declare themselves independent of any political groups. In countries like Italy, Spain, and Ireland, which was still under British rule, parliamentary politics were not seen as a serious means for workers to express their grievances. Most workers were disenfranchised. Yet even in France or Britain, where most male workers had the right to vote, many workers did not trust party politics. The enormous numerical growth of well-organized socialist parties, such as in Germany and Italy, did not, in the minds of many workers, correlate with any real advance in the class struggle as these parties were thought to be overly concerned with building the parties themselves and with electoral politics than with the class struggle and had therefore lost their original revolutionary edge. The socialists preached the inevitability of socialism, but were in practice bureaucratic and reformist. Similarly, the trade unions frequently allied with those parties, equally growing in numbers, were denounced for their expanding bureaucracies, their centralization, and for failing to represent workers' interests. For example, between 1902 and 1913 the German free trade unions's membership grew by 350% but its bureaucracy by more than 1900%.\n\nAnother common explanation for the rise of syndicalism that it is a result of the economic backwardness of the countries in which it emerged, particularly France. Newer studies have questioned this account. The economist Ernesto Screpanti hypothesized that strike waves such as the one from 1911 to 1922 generally occur during the upper turning-points of the periodic global long cycles of boom and bust known as Kondratieff waves. Such waves of proletarian insurgency, claims Screpanti, were global in reach, saw workers breaking free of the dynamics of the capitalist system, and aimed to overthrow that system.\n\nAccording to van der Linden and Thorpe, changes in labor processes also contributed to the radicalization of workers and thereby to the rise of syndicalism. This rise took place during the Second Industrial Revolution. Two groups of workers were most attracted to syndicalism: casual or seasonal laborers who frequently changed jobs and workers whose occupations were being as a result of technological advances. The first group includes landless agricultural workers, construction workers, and dockers, all of whom were disproportionately represented in several countries' syndicalist movements. Because they frequently changed jobs, such workers did not have close relationships with their employers and the risk of losing one's job as a result of a strike was reduced. Moreover, because of the time constraints of their jobs they were forced to act immediately in order to achieve anything and could not plan for the long term by building up strike funds or powerful labor organizations or by engaging in mediation. Their working conditions gave them an inclination to engage in direct confrontation with employers and apply direct action. The second group includes miners, railway employees, and certain factory workers. Their occupations were deskilled by technological and organizational changes. These changes made workers from the second group similar in some respects to the first group. They did not entirely result from the introduction of new technology, but were also caused by changes in management methods. This included increased supervision of workers, piecework, internal promotions, all designed make workers docile and loyal and to transfer knowledge and control over the process of production from workers to employers. Frustration with this loss of power led to formal and informal resistance by workers. Altena disagrees with this explanation. According to him, it was workers with significant autonomy in their jobs and pride in their skills who were most attracted to syndicalism. Moreover, he argues, explanations based on workers' occupations cannot explain why only a minority of workers in those jobs became syndicalists or why in some professions workers in different locations had vastly different patterns of organization. The small size of many syndicalist unions also makes observations about which workers joined statistically irrelevant.\nSyndicalism came to be seen as a viable strategy because the general strike became a practical possibility. Although it had been advocated before, there were not sufficient numbers of wage workers to bring society to a standstill and they had not achieved a sufficient degree of organization and solidarity until the 1890s, according van der Linden and Thorpe. Several general or political strikes then took place before World War: in 1893 and in 1902 in Belgium, in 1902 and in 1909 in Sweden, in 1903 in the Netherlands, in 1904 in Italy in addition to significant work stoppages during the Russian Revolution of 1905.\n\nDarlington cites the significance of the conscious intervention by syndicalist militants. The industrial unrest of the period created conditions which made workers receptive to syndicalist leaders' agitation. They spread their ideas through pamphlets and newspapers and had considerable influence in a number of labor disputes. Finally, van der Linden and Thorpe point to spatial and geographical factors that shaped the rise of syndicalism. Workers who would otherwise not have had an inclination to syndicalism joined because syndicalism was dominant in their locales. Workers in the Canadian and American West for example, were generally more radical and drawn to the IWW and One Big Union than their counterparts in the East. Similarly, southern workers were more drawn to syndicalism in Italy. According to Altena, the emergence of syndicalism must be analyzed at the level of local communities. Only differences in local social and economic structures explain why some towns had a strong syndicalist presence, but others did not.\nSyndicalism was not informed by theory or a systematically elaborated ideology the same way socialism was by Marxism. Émile Pouget, a CGT leader, maintained that: \"What sets syndicalism apart from the various schools of socialism and makes it superior is its doctrinal sobriety. Inside the unions, there is little philosophising. They do better than that: they act!\" Similarly, Andreu Nin of the Spanish CNT proclaimed in 1919: \"I am a fanatic of action, of revolution. I believe in actions more than in remote ideologies and abstract questions.\" Though workers' education was important at least to committed activists, syndicalists distrusted bourgeois intellectuals, wanting to maintain workers' control over the movement. Syndicalist thinking was elaborated in pamphlets, leaflets, speeches, and articles and in the movement's own newspapers. These writings consisted mainly in calls to action and discussions of tactics in class struggle. The philosopher Georges Sorel's \"Reflections on Violence\" introduced syndicalist ideas to a broader audience. Sorel fancied himself the premier theorist of syndicalism and was frequently thought of as such, but he was not a part of the movement and his influence on syndicalism was insignificant, except in Italy and Poland.\n\nThe extent to which syndicalist positions reflected merely the views of leaders and to what extent those positions were shared by syndicalist organizations' rank-and-file is a matter of dispute. The historian Peter Stearns, commenting on French syndicalism, concludes that most workers did not identify with syndicalism's long-range goals and that syndicalist hegemony accounts for the relatively slow growth of the French labor movement as a whole. Workers who joined the syndicalist movement, he claims, were on the whole indifferent to doctrinal questions, their membership in syndicalist organizations was partly accidental and leaders were unable to convert workers to syndicalist ideas. Frederick Ridley, a political scientist, is more equivocal. According to him, leaders were very influential in the drafting of syndicalist ideas, but syndicalism was more than a mere tool of a few leaders, but a genuine product of the French labor movement. Darlington adds that in the Irish ITGWU most members were won over by the union's philosophy of direct action. Bert Altena argues that, though evidence of ordinary workers' convictions is scant, it indicates that they were aware of doctrinal differences between various currents in the labor movement and able to defend their own views. He points out that they likely understood syndicalist newspapers and debated political issues.\n\n\"Syndicalism\" is used by some interchangeably with \"anarcho-syndicalism\". This term was first used in 1907, by socialists criticizing the political neutrality of the CGT, although it was rarely used until the early 1920s when communists used it disparagingly. Only from 1922 was it used by self-avowed anarcho-syndicalists. Syndicalism has traditionally been seen as a current within anarchism, but in some countries it was dominated by Marxists rather than anarchists. This was the case in Italy and much of the Anglophone world, including Ireland where anarchists had no significant influence on syndicalism. The extent to which syndicalist doctrine was a product of anarchism is debated. The anarchist Iain McKay argues that \"syndicalism\" is but a new name for ideas and tactics developed by Bakunin and the anarchist wing of the First International, while it is wholly inconsistent with positions Marx and Engels took. According to him, the fact that many Marxists embraced syndicalism merely indicates that they abandoned Marx's views and converted to Bakunin's. Altena too views syndicalism as part of the broader anarchist movement, but concedes there was a tension between this and the fact that it was also a labor movement. He also sees Marxist ideas reflected in the movement, as leading syndicalists such as F. Domela Nieuwenhuis and Christiaan Cornelissen as well as much of the Australian syndicalist movement were influenced by them, as well as older socialist notions. According to Darlington, anarchism, Marxism, and revolutionary trade unionism equally contributed to syndicalism, in addition to various influences in specific countries, including Blanquism, anti-clericalism, republicanism, and agrarian radicalism.\n\nBill Haywood, a leading figure in the IWW, defined the union's purpose at its founding congress as \"the emancipation of the working class from the slave bondage of capitalism\". Syndicalists held that society was divided into two great classes, the working class and the bourgeoisie. Their interests being irreconcilable, they must be in a constant state of class struggle. Tom Mann, a British syndicalist, declared that \"the object of the unions is to wage the Class War\". This war, according to syndicalist doctrine, was aimed not just at gaining concessions such as higher wages or a shorter working day, but at the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism.\n\nSyndicalists agreed with Karl Marx's characterization of the state as the \"executive committee of the ruling class\". They held that a society's economic order determined its political order and concluded that the former could not be overthrown by changes to the latter. Nevertheless, a number of leading syndicalist figures worked in political parties and some ran for elected office. Jim Larkin, the leader of the Irish ITGWU, was active in the Labour Party, Haywood in the Socialist Party of America. Yet, they saw the economic sphere as the primary arena for revolutionary struggle, while involvement in politics could at best be an \"echo\" of industrial struggle. They were skeptical of parliamentary politics. According to Father Thomas Hagerty, a Catholic priest and IWW leader, \"dropping pieces of paper into a hole in a box never did achieve emancipation for the working class, and to my thinking it will never achieve it\". Syndicalist trade unions declared their political neutrality and autonomy from political parties. Political parties, syndicalists reasoned, grouped people according to their political views, uniting members of different classes. Unions, on the other hand, were to be purely working-class organizations, uniting the entire class, and could therefore not be divided on political grounds. The French syndicalist Pouget explained: \"The CGT embraces outside of all the schools of politics all workers cognisant of the struggle to be waged for the elimination of wage-slavery and the employer class.\" In practice, however, this neutrality was more ambiguous. The CGT, for example, worked with the Socialist Party in the struggle against the Three-Year Law, which extended conscription. During the Spanish Civil War the CNT, whose policy barred anyone who had been a candidate for political office or had participated in political endeavors from representing it, was intimately connected with the Iberian Anarchist Federation (\"Federación Anarquista Ibérica\", FAI).\n\nIn the syndicalist conception, unions played a dual role. They were organs of struggle within capitalism for better working conditions, but they were also to play a key role in the revolution to overthrow capitalism. Victor Griffuelhes expressed this at the CGT's 1906 congress in the following manner: \"In its day-to-day demands, syndicalism seeks the co-ordination of workers' efforts, the increase of workers' well-being by the achievement of immediate improvements, such as the reduction of working hours, the increase of wages, etc. But this task is only one aspect of the work of syndicalism; it prepares for complete emancipation, which can be realised only by expropriating the capitalist class\". For unions to fulfill this role, it was necessary to prevent bureaucrats \"whose sole purpose in life seems to be apologising for and defending the capitalist system of exploitation\", according to Larkin from inhibiting workers' militant zeal. Battling bureaucracy and reformism within the labor movement was a major theme for syndicalists. One expression of this was many syndicalists' rejection of collective bargaining agreements, which were thought to force labor peace upon workers and break their solidarity. The Wobblie Vincent St. John declared: \"There is but one bargain that the Industrial Workers of the World will make with the employing class complete surrender of the means of production.\" The Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (\"Federación Obrera Regional Argentina\", FORA) and the OBU did, however, accept such deals and others began accepting them eventually. Similarly, syndicalist unions did not work to build large strike funds, for fear that they would create bureaucracy separate from the rank-and-file and instill in workers the expectation that the union rather than they would wage the class struggle.\nSyndicalists advocated direct action, including working to rule, passive resistance, sabotage, and strikes, particularly the general strike, as tactics in the class struggle, as opposed to indirect action such as electoral politics. The IWW engaged in around 30 mostly successful civil disobedience campaigns they deemed free speech fights. Wobblies would defy laws restricting public speeches, in order to clog up prisons and court systems as a result of hundreds of arrests, ultimately forcing public officials to rescind such laws. Sabotage ranged from slow or inefficient work to destruction of machinery and physical violence. French railway and postal workers cut telegraph and signal lines during strikes in 1909 and 1910.\n\nThe final step towards revolution, according to syndicalists, would be a general strike. It would be \"the curtain drop on a tired old scene of several centuries, and the curtain raising on another\", according to Griffuelhes.\n\nSyndicalists remained vague about the society they envisioned to replace capitalism, claiming that it was impossible to foresee in detail. Labor unions were seen as being the embryo of a new society in addition to being the means of struggle within the old. Syndicalists generally agreed that in a free society production would be managed by workers. The state apparatus would be replaced by the rule of workers' organizations. In such a society individuals would be liberated, both in the economic sphere but also in their private and social lives.\n\nSyndicalist policies on gender issues were mixed. The CNT did not admit women as members until 1918. The CGT dismissed feminism as a bourgeois movement. Syndicalists were mostly indifferent to the question of women's suffrage. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, an IWW organizer, insisted that women \"find their power at the point of production where they work\", rather than at the ballot box. Of the 230 delegates present at the founding of Canada's One Big Union, a mere 3 were women. When a female radical criticized the masculinist atmosphere at the meeting, she was rebuffed by men who insisted that labor only concern itself with class rather than gender issues. The historian Todd McCallum concludes that syndicalists in the OBU advocated values of \"radical manhood\".\n\nSyndicalists were involved in a number strikes, labor disputes, and other struggles. In the United States, the IWW was involved in at least 150 strikes including miners' strikes in Goldfield, Nevada in 1906–1907, a steel workers' strike in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania in 1909, a textile workers' strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, timber workers' strikes in Louisiana and Arkansas in 1912–1913, and a silk workers' strike in Paterson, New Jersey. The most prominent was the struggle in Lawrence. Wobblie leaders brought together 23,000 mostly immigrant workers, many of whom did not speak English. They arranged for workers' children to be sent to live with sympathetic families outside of Lawrence for the duration of the strike so their parents could focus on the struggle. Unlike most IWW-led strikes, the struggle was successful. In Mexico, syndicalism first emerged in 1906 during a violent miners' strike in Cananea and an even more violent textile workers' strike in Río Blanco, Veracruz. In 1912, during the 1910–1920 Mexican Revolution, anarchists formed the syndicalist union House of the World Worker (\"Casa del Obrero Mundial\"). It led a series of successful strikes in 1913 in Mexico City and central Mexico. After the Constitutionalist Army occupied the capital in 1914, syndicalists allied with the government it established to defeat rural forces such as the Zapatistas and therefore received government support. Once those forces had been suppressed, this alliance broke apart and the \"Casa\" campaigned for workers' control of factories and the nationalization of foreign capital. It contributed to a rise in labor unrest that began in mid-1915. It led general strikes in May and in July–August 1916 in greater Mexico City. The latter was quelled by the army, marking the defeat of the \"Casa\", which was also suppressed.\n\nIn Portugal, the deposition of the King in 1910 was followed by a strike wave throughout the country. After the police occupied the offices of an agricultural union, syndicalists called for a general strike. During the strike, Lisbon was controlled by workers and there were armed uprisings in several other cities. In 1912, the strike wave ebbed off. The Spanish CNT, shortly after its first congress, participated in a general strike. It was accused of having instigated the strike, but it is unclear to what extent it was responsible. In any case, the CNT was banned by the state for its role.\n\nBritish Wobblies were involved in two major strikes in Scotland, one at Argyll Motor Works and the second at a Singer's sewing machine factory in Clydebank. In 1906, several industrial unionists began to spread their ideas and organize workers at Singer's. In 1911, they organized a strike after a woman was fired for not working hard enough. The strike was cleverly defeated by management and most activists lost their jobs. The ISEL leader Tom Mann was also at the center of several labor disputes during the Great Labour Unrest, including the 1911 Liverpool general transport strike where he chaired the strike committee. In Ireland, Jim Larkin and the ITGWU led 20,000 during the 1913 Dublin lockout. After the ITGWU attempted to unionize Dublin's trams and tram workers went on strike, the city's employers threatened to fire any workers who did not sign a pledge to not support the ITGWU, thereby turning the dispute into a city-wide conflict in late September. Workers' resistance crumbled in January 1914.\nThere was no international syndicalist organization prior to World War I. In 1907, CGT activists presented the Charter of Amiens and syndicalism to an international audience a higher form of anarchism at the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam in 1907. Discussions at the Congress led to the formation of the international syndicalist journal \"Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste\". The CGT was affiliated with the International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centers (ISNTUC), which brought together reformist socialist unions. Both the Dutch NAS and the British ISEL attempted to remedy the lack of a syndicalist counterpart to ISNTUC in 1913, simultaneously publishing calls for an international syndicalist congress in 1913. The CGT rejected the invitation. Its leaders feared that leaving ISNTUC, which it intended to revolutionize from within, would split the CGT and harm working class unity. The IWW also did not participate, as it considered itself an international in its own right. The First International Syndicalist Congress was held in London from September 27 to October 2. It was attended by 38 delegates from 65 organizations in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Discussions were contentious and did not lead to the founding of a syndicalist international. Delegates did agree on a declaration of principles describing syndicalism's core tenets. They also decided to launch an International Syndicalist Information Bureau and to hold another congress in Amsterdam. This congress did not take place due to the outbreak of World War I.\nSyndicalists had long opposed nationalism and militarism. Haywood held that \"it is better to be a traitor to your country than to your class\". French syndicalists viewed the Army as the primary defender of the capitalist order. In 1901, the CGT published a manual for soldiers encouraging desertion. Similarly, in 1911 British syndicalists distributed an \"Open Letter to British Soldiers\" imploring them not to shoot on striking workers, but to join the working class's struggle against capital. Patriotism, syndicalists argued, was a means of integrating workers into capitalist society by distracting them from their true class interest. In 1908, the CGT's congress invoked the slogan of the First International, proclaiming that the \"workers have no fatherland\".\nWhen World War I broke out in July 1914, socialist parties and trade unions both in neutral and belligerent countries supported their respective nations' war efforts or national defense, despite previous pledges to do the opposite. Socialists agreed to put aside class conflict and vote for war credits. German socialists argued that war was necessary to defend against Russia's barbaric Tsarism, while their French counterparts pointed to the need to defend against Prussian militarism and the German \"instinct of domination and of discipline\". This collaboration between the socialist movement and the state was known as the \"union sacrée\" in France, the \"Burgfrieden\" in Germany, and \"godsvrede\" in the Netherlands. Moreover, a number of anarchists led by Peter Kropotkin, including the influential syndicalist Christiaan Cornelissen, issued the Manifesto of the Sixteen, supporting the Allied cause in the war. Most syndicalists, however, remained true to their internationalist and anti-militarist principles by opposing the war and their respective nation's participation in it.\n\nThe majority of the French CGT and a sizable minority in the Italian USI did not. The CGT had long had a moderate, reformist wing, which gained the upper hand. As a result, according to historians like Darlington or van der Linden and Thorpe, the CGT was no longer a revolutionary syndicalist organization after the start of World War I. It followed the French president's call for national unity by agreeing to a no-strike pledge and to resolve labor disputes through arbitration and by actively participating in the French war effort. Most of the its members of military age were conscripted without resistance and its ranks shrank from 350,000 in 1913 to 49,000 dues-paying members in 1915. CGT leaders defended this course by arguing that France's war against Germany was a war between democracy and republicanism on the one side and barbaric militarism on the other. Italy did not initially participate in World War I, which was deeply unpopular in the country, when it broke out. The Socialist Party and the reformist General Confederation of Labor opposed Italian intervention in the Great War. Once Italy became a participant, the socialists refused to support the war effort, but also refrained from working against it. From the start of the war, even before Italy did so, a minority within USI, led by the most famous Italian syndicalist, Alceste De Ambris, called on the Italian state to take the Allies' side. The pro-war syndicalists saw Italian participation in the war as the completion of nationhood. They also felt compelled to oppose the socialists' neutrality and therefore support the war. Finally, they gave similar arguments as the French, warning of the dangers posed by the \"suffocating imperialism of Germany\", and felt obliged to follow the CGT's lead.\nUSI's pro-war wing had the support of less than a third of the organization's members and it was forced out in September 1914. Its anarchist wing, led by Armando Borghi, was firmly opposed to the war, deeming it incompatible with workers' internationalism and predicting that it would only serve elites and governments. Its opposition was met with government repression and Borghi and others were interned by the end of the war. The anti-war faction in the CGT, on the other hand, was a small minority. It was led by the likes of Pierre Monatte and Alphonse Merrheim. They would link up with anti-war socialists from around Europe at the 1915 Zimmerwald conference. They faced considerable difficulties putting up meaningful resistance against the war. The government called up militants to the Army, including Monatte. He considered refusing the order and being summarily executed, but decided this would be futile. Syndicalist organizations in other countries nearly unanimously opposed the war. \"Let Germany win, let France win, it is all the same to the workers,\" José Negre of the CNT in neutral Spain declared. The CNT insisted that syndicalists could support neither side in an imperialist conflict. A wave of pro-British sentiment swept Ireland during the war, although the ITGWU and the rest of the Irish labor movement opposed it, and half of the ITGWU's membership enlisted in the British military. The ITGWU had also been significantly weakened in 1913 in the Dublin Lockout. After Jim Larkin left Ireland in 1914, James Connolly took over leadership of the union. Because of the organization's weakness, Connolly allied it along with its paramilitary force, the Irish Citizen Army, with the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Together, they instigated the Easter Rising, seeking to weaken the British Empire and hoping that the insurrection would spread throughout Europe. The uprising was quickly quelled by the British army and Connolly was executed. In Germany, the small FVdG opposed the socialists' \"Burgfrieden\" and Germany's involvement in the war, challenging the claim that the country was waging a defensive war. Its journals were suppressed and a number of its members were arrested. The United States did not enter the war until the spring of 1917. The start of the war had induced an economic boom in the US, tightening the labor market and thereby strengthening workers' bargaining position. The IWW profited from this, more than doubling its membership between 1916 and 1917. At the same time, the Wobblies fervently denounced the war and mulled calling an anti-war general strike. Once America became a combatant, the IWW maintained its anti-war stance, while its bitter rival, the AFL, supported the war. It did not, however, launch an anti-war campaign, as it feared the government would crush it if it did and wanted to focus on its economic struggles. The IWW's practical opposition to the war was limited, 95% of eligible IWW members registered for the draft, and most of those drafted served. Syndicalists in the Netherlands and Sweden, both neutral countries, criticized the truce socialists entered with their governments in order to shore up national defense. The Dutch NAS disowned Cornelissen, one of its founders, for his support for the war.\nSyndicalists from Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, France, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, and Cuba met at an anti-war congress in El Ferrol, Spain, in April 1915. The congress was poorly planned and prohibited by the Spanish authorities, but delegates managed to discuss resistance to the war and extending international cooperation between syndicalist groups. Argentine, Brazilian, Spanish, and Portuguese delegates later met in October in Rio de Janeiro to continue discussions and resolved to deepen cooperation between South American syndicalists. While syndicalists were only able to put up a rather limited practical struggle against World War I, they also looked to challenge the war on an ideological or cultural level. They pointed to the horrors of war and spurned efforts to legitimate it as something noble. German syndicalists drew attention to the death, injury, destruction, and misery that the war wrought. German, Swedish, Dutch, and Spanish syndicalists denounced nationalism with \"Tierra y Libertad\", a syndicalist journal in Barcelona, calling it a \"grotesque mentality\". The Dutch newspaper \"De Arbeid\" criticized nationalism, because \"it finds its embodiment in the state and is the denial of class antagonism between the haves and the have-nots\". German and Spanish syndicalists went further still by putting into question the concept of nationhood itself and dismissing it as a mere social construct. The Germans pointed out that most inhabitants of the German Empire identified not as Germans, but in regional terms as Prussians or Bavarians and the like. Multilingual countries like Germany and Spain also could not claim a common language as a defining characteristic of the nation nor did members of the same nation share the same values or experiences, syndicalists in Spain and Germany argued. Syndicalists also argued against the notion that the war was a clash of different cultures or that it could be justified as a defense of civilization. Various cultures were not mutually hostile, they claimed, and the state should not be seen as the embodiment of culture, since culture was the product of the entire population, while the state acted in the interests of just a few. Moreover, they argued that if culture was to be understood as \"high culture\", the very workers dying in the war were denied access to that culture by capitalist conditions. Finally, syndicalists railed against religious justifications for war. Before the war, they had rejected religion as divisive at best, but support for the war by both Catholic and Protestant clergy revealed their hypocrisy and disgraced the principles Christianity claimed to uphold, they claimed.\n\nAs the war progressed, disaffection with worsening living conditions at home and a growing numbers of casualties at the front eroded the enthusiasm and patriotism the outbreak of war had aroused. Prices were on the rise, food was scarce, and it became increasingly clear that the war would not be short. In Germany, for example, food shortages led to demonstrations and riots in a number of cities in the summer of 1916. At the same time, anti-war demonstrations started. Strikes picked up from around 1916 or 1917 on across Europe and soldiers began to mutiny. Workers distrusted their socialist leaders who had joined the war effort. Thanks in part to their fidelity to internationalism, syndicalist organizations profited from this development and expanded as the war drew to an end.\n\nDisaffection with the war condensed in the post-World War I revolutions that began with the 1917 Russian Revolution. In February 1917, strikes, riots, and troop mutinies broke out in Petrograd, forcing the Russian Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate on March 2 in favor of a provisional government. Immediately, anarchist groups emerged. Russian syndicalists organized around the journal \"Golos Truda\" (\"The Voice of Labor\"), which had a circulation of around 25,000, and the Union of Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda. Anarchists found themselves agreeing with the Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin, who returned to Russia in April, as both sought to bring down the provisional government. Lenin abandoned the idea that capitalism is a necessary stage on Russia's path to communism; dismissed the establishment of a parliament, favoring that power be taken by soviets; and called for the abolition of the police, the army, the bureaucracy, and finally the state all sentiments syndicalists shared. Although the syndicalists also welcomed the soviets, they were most enthusiastic about the factory committees and workers' councils that had emerged in all industrial centers in the course of strikes and demonstrations in the February Revolution. The committees fought for higher wages and shorter hours, but above all for workers' control over production, which both the syndicalists and Bolsheviks supported. The syndicalists viewed the factory committees as the true form of syndicalist organization, not unions. Because they were better organized, the Bolsheviks were able to gain more traction in the committees with six times as many delegates in a typical factory. Despite the goals they had in common, syndicalists became anxious about the Bolsheviks' growing influence, especially after they won majorities in the Petrograd and Moscow soviets in September.\n\nThe Petrograd Soviet established the 66-member Military Revolutionary Committee, which included four anarchists, among them the syndicalist Shatov. On October 25, this committee led the October Revolution; after taking control of the Winter Palace and key points in the capital with little resistance, it proclaimed a Soviet government. Anarchists were jubilant at the toppling of the provisional government. They were concerned about the proclamation of a new government, fearing a dictatorship of the proletariat, even more so after the Bolsheviks created the central Soviet of People's Commissars composed only of members of their party. They called for decentralization of power, but agreed with Lenin's labor program, which endorsed workers' control in all enterprises of a certain minimum size. The introduction of workers' control led to economic chaos. Lenin turned to restoring discipline in the factories and order to the economy in December by putting the economy under state control. At a trade union congress in January, the syndicalists, who had paid little attention to the unions, only had 6 delegates, while the Bolsheviks had 273. No longer depending on their help in toppling the provisional government, the Bolsheviks were now in a position to ignore the syndicalists' opposition and outvoted them at this congress. They opted to disempower local committees by subordinating them to the trade unions, which in turn became organs of the state. The Bolsheviks argued that workers' control did not mean that workers controlled factories at the local level and that this control had to be centralized and put under a broader economic plan. The syndicalists criticized the Bolshevik regime bitterly, characterizing it as state capitalist. They denounced state control over the factories and agitated for decentralization of power in politics and the economy and \"syndicalization\" of industry. The Civil War against the White Army split anarchists. The syndicalists were criticized harshly, because most supported the Bolshevik regime in the war even as they excoriated Bolshevik policy. They reasoned that a White victory would be worse and that the Whites had to be defeated before a third revolution could topple the Bolsheviks. Yet, syndicalists were harassed and repeatedly arrested by the police, particularly the Cheka, from 1919 on. Their demands had some sway with workers and dissidents within the Bolshevik party and the Bolshevik leadership viewed them as the most dangerous part of the libertarian movement. After the Civil War ended, workers and sailors, including both anarchists and Bolsheviks, rose up in 1921 in Kronstadt, a bastion of radicalism since 1905, against what they saw as the rule of a small number of bureaucrats. Anarchists hailed the rebellion as the start of the third revolution. The government reacted by having anarchists throughout the country arrested, including a number of syndicalist leaders. The Russian syndicalist movement was thereby defeated.\n\nSyndicalists in the West who had opposed World War I reacted gushingly to the Russian Revolution. Though they were still coming to grips with the evolving Bolshevik ideology and despite traditional anarchist suspicions of Marxism, they saw in Russia a revolution that had taken place against parliamentary politics and under the influence of workers' councils. They also, at this point, had only limited knowledge of the reality in Russia. Augustin Souchy, a German anarcho-syndicalist, hailed it \"the great passion that swept us all along. In the East, so we believed, the sun of freedom rose.\" The Spanish CNT declared: \"Bolshevism is the name, but the idea is that of all revolutions: economic freedom. [...] Bolshevism is the new life for which we struggle, it is freedom, harmony, justice, it is the life that we want and will enforce in the world.\" Borghi recalled: \"We exulted in its victories. We trembled at its risks.[...] We made a symbol and an altar of its name, its dead, its living and its heroes.\" He called on Italians to \"do as they did in Russia\". Indeed, a revolutionary wave, inspired in part by Russia, swept Europe in the following years.\nIn Germany, strikes and protests against food shortage, mainly by women, escalated and by 1917 had eroded public confidence in the government. The German Emperor was forced to abdicate in November 1918 after sailors' mutinies sparked an insurrectionary movement throughout the country. The syndicalist FVdG, which had just 6,000 members before the war and was almost completely suppressed by the state during the war, regrouped at a conference in Berlin in December 1918. It was active in the revolutionary events of the following years, particularly in the Ruhr area. It supported spontaneous strikes and championed direct action and sabotage. The FVdG started to be held in high regard for its radicalism by workers, particularly miners, who appreciated the syndicalists' ability to theorize their struggles and their experience with direct action methods. Starting in the second half of 1919, workers disappointed by the socialist party's and unions' support for the war and previously non-unionized unskilled workers who were radicalized during the war flocked to the FVdG. The revolution also saw the introduction to Germany of industrial unionism along the lines of the IWW with some support from the American organization, but also with links to the left wing of the Communist Party. In December 1919, the Free Workers' Union of Germany (Syndicalists) (\"Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands (Syndikalisten)\", FAUD) was formed, claiming to represent over 110,000 workers, more than eighteen times the FVdG's pre-war membership. Most of the new organization came from the FVdG, but industrial unionists, whose influence was dwindling, were also involved. Rudolf Rocker, an anarchist recently returned to Germany after spending several years in London, wrote the FAUD's program. \n\nIn Portugal, working class unrest picked up from the start of the war. In 1917, radicals began to dominate the labor movement as a result of the war, the dictatorship established that year, and the influence of the Russian Revolution. In November 1918, a general strike was called but failed and in 1919 the syndicalist General Confederation of Labour (\"Confederação Geral do Trabalho\", CGT) was formed as the country's first national union confederation.\nIn Brazil, in both Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, syndicalists, along with anarchists and socialists, were leaders in a cycle of labor struggles from 1917 to 1919. It included a general strike in 1917, a failed uprising in 1918 inspired by the Russian Revolution, and a number of smaller strikes. The movement was put down by increased organization by employers to resist workers' demands and by government repression, including the closure of unions, arrests, deportations of foreign militants, and violence, with some 200 workers killed in São Paulo alone. In Argentina, FORA had split into the anarcho-communist FORA V and the syndicalist FORA IX. While FORA V called for a futile general strike in 1915, FORA IX was more careful. It called off general strikes it had planned in 1917 and 1918. In January 1919, five workers were by the authorities during a strike led by a union with tenuous links to FORA V. At the funeral, police killed another 39 workers. Both FORA organizations called for a general strike, which continued after FORA IX reached a settlement. Vigilantes, supported by business and the military, attacked unions and militants. In all, between 100 and 700 people died in what became known as the Tragic Week. Nevertheless, strikes continued to increase and both FORA V and IX grew.\n\nThe United States underwent an increase in labor militancy during the post-war period. 1919 saw a a general strike in Seattle, large miners' strikes, a police strike in Boston, and a nationwide steel strike. The IWW, however, had been nearly destroyed in the previous two years by local criminal syndicalism laws, the federal government, and vigilante violence. It attempted to take credit for some of the strikes, but in reality was too weak to play a significant role. The post-war Red Scare intensified the attacks on the IWW and by the end of 1919 the IWW was practically powerless. In 1919 Canada was hit by a labor revolt, leading to the formation of One Big Union, which was only partly industrial unionist.\nThough the Bolsheviks suppressed syndicalism in Russia, they courted syndicalists abroad as part of their international strategy. In March 1919, the Comintern or Third International was founded at a conference in Moscow. The Bolsheviks acknowledged syndicalism's opposition to socialist reformism and saw them as part of the revolutionary wing of the labor movement. No syndicalists attended the founding convention, mainly because the blockade of Russia by the Allies powers made travel to Moscow near impossible. After long discussions, the CNT opted to join the Comintern, though it classified its adherence as provisional as a concession to detractors of Bolshevism. USI also decided to join, though some like Borghi had reservations about the course of events in Russia. In France, the CGT's radical minority that had opposed the war enthusiastically supported Bolshevism. They formed the Revolutionary Syndicalist Committees and attempted to push the CGT as a whole to support the Comintern. The General Executive Board of the IWW decided join the Comintern, but this decision was never confirmed by a convention. German and Swedish syndicalists were more critical of Bolshevism from the start. Rocker declared already in August 1918 that the Bolshevik regime was \"but a new system of tyranny\" and they clashed on a number of issues.\n\nThe second congress of the Comintern in the summer of 1920 was attended by numerous syndicalists. The Italian USI, the Spanish CNT, the British shop stewards, and the revolutionary minority of the CGT had official representatives, but others like John Reed of the American IWW and Augustin Souchy of the German FAUD also attended in an unofficial capacity. Western syndicalists' knowledge of the facts on the ground in Russia was at this point rather limited. They thought of the soviets as organs of workers' control over production and the Bolsheviks depicted them as such. Syndicalists were not aware of the extent to which they were in reality subordinated to the communist party. The congress, however, revealed the irreconcilable differences between the syndicalist and the Bolshevik approach. Even before the congress, at a meeting of the Comintern's Executive Committee a document, a document was proposed that derided the apolitical unions as \"lackeys of imperialist capitalism\" for their betrayal during the war, to which syndicalists replied that of the syndicalist unions this only applied to the CGT. \n\nThe International Workers' Association, formed in 1922, is an international syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. At its peak, it represented millions of workers and competed directly for the hearts and minds of the working class with social democratic unions and parties.\n\nFrom the early 1920s, syndicalist movements in most countries began to wane. State repression played a significant role, but movements that were not suppressed also declined. Faced with this decline, syndicalist organizations had three choices: They could stay true to their revolutionary principles and be marginalized. They could give up those principles in order to adapt to new conditions. Finally, they could disband or merge into non-syndicalist organizations. The IWW is an example of the first case. The French CGT, which according to van der Linden and Thorpe was no longer syndicalist after 1914, went the second route. By the end of the 1930s, meaningful legal syndicalist organizations existed only in Bolivia, Chile, Sweden, and Uruguay.\n\nGeorges Sorel played a role in shaping the views of Benito Mussolini and by extension the wider Italian fascist movement. In March 1921, Sorel wrote that Mussolini was \"a man no less extraordinary than Lenin\". After Sorel's death in 1922, Agostino Lanzillo, a one-time syndicalist leader who had become a fascist, wrote in the Italian fascist review \"Gerarchia\", which was edited by Mussolini: \"Perhaps fascism may have the good fortune to fulfill a mission that is the implicit aspiration of the whole oeuvre of the master of syndicalism: to tear away the proletariat from the domination of the Socialist party, to reconstitute it on the basis of spiritual liberty, and to animate it with the breath of creative violence. This would be the true revolution that would mold the forms of the Italy of tomorrow\".\nThe anarcho-syndicalist revolution during the Spanish Civil War resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia and parts of the Levante. Much of Spain's economy was put under worker control—in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%.\nSyndicalism's decline was the result of a number of factors. In Russia, Italy, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands, syndicalist movements were suppressed by authoritarian governments. The IWW in the United States and the Mexican House of the World Worker were weakened considerably by state repression. Syndicalist movements that were not suppressed also declined. According to van der Linden and Thorpe, this was primarily the result of the integration of the working class into capitalist relations. Proletarian families became units of individualized consumption as standards of living increased. This was partly the result of state intervention, particularly the emergence of the welfare state. Avenues for social reform opened up and the franchise was widened, giving parliamentary reformism legitimacy. Altena agrees that the state's growing influence in society was decisive for syndicalism's diminished influence. In addition to the welfare state, he refers to the increased significance of national policies, which eroded local autonomy. This made centralized unions able to negotiate national agreements more important and national and parliamentary politics more enticing for workers. They therefore turned to social democracy in larger numbers. Additionally, syndicalism lost out to sports and entertainment in the cultural sphere, according to Altena.\n\nVadim Dam'e adds to this that the development of capitalist production and changes in the division of labor diminished syndicalism's recruitment base. According to authors like Stearns, Edward Shorter, Charles Tilly, and Bob Holton, who deem syndicalism a transitional form of workers' resistance between older craft-based and modern factory-based industry, syndicalism's decline was a product of that transition having been completed and workers being assimilated to capitalist factory discipline. Darlington counters that syndicalism attracted a variety of workers, not just artisans and skilled workers, but concedes that such changes did play a role in Spain, France, and some other countries.\n\nSeveral authors claim that syndicalism's demise was the result of workers' inherent pragmatism or conservatism, causing them to only be interested in immediate material gains, rather than long-term goals like overthrowing capitalism. Robert Hoxie, Selig Perlman, and Patrick Renshaw invoke this argument to explain the IWW's decline and Stearns, Dermot Keogh, and G. D. H. Cole do so with respect to French, Irish, and British syndicalism, respectively. Darlington disputes the assumption that workers are incapable of developing a revolutionary consciousness. Seeking material gains is not incompatible, he claims, with developing class consciousness, which entails the awareness that workers' material interests conflict with capitalism, particularly in times of crisis.\n\nAccording to many Marxists, syndicalism was a reaction to reformism in the labor movement and could not survive without it. The collapse of reformism after the war therefore automatically weakened syndicalism. According Eric Hobsbawm, the biggest reason for syndicalism's decline, however, was the rise of communism. Several communist parties drew their cadres from the syndicalists' ranks. To radical workers the programmatic distinctions between syndicalism and communism were not all that relevant. The key is that after the war communism represented militancy or revolutionary attitude as such. Darlington, too, sees the effects of the Russian Revolution as an important reason for the decline of syndicalism. The emergence of communism highlighted syndicalism's inherent weaknesses: the contradiction of building organizations that sought to be both revolutionary cadre organizations and mass labor unions, the emphasis on economic struggle to the detriment of political action, and the commitment to localism limiting its ability to provide an effective centralized organization and leadership. Bolshevism's overcoming of these limitations and its success in Russia drew syndicalist leaders and members. It also exacerbated splits within the syndicalist camp.\n\nFascist victory in the Spanish Civil War put an end to syndicalism as a mass movement. Immediately after World War II, there were attempts to rekindle anarcho-syndicalism in Germany, but they were thwarted by Cold War anti-communism, Stalinism, and a failure to attract newer younger activists. Syndicalists maintained some influence in Latin American labor movements into the 1970s. The protest movements of the late 1960s saw renewed interest in syndicalism by activists in Germany, the US, and Britain. In the 1980s, in communist Poland, the trade union Solidarity (\"Solidarność\"), though not strictly syndicalist, attracted masses of dissident workers by reviving many syndicalist ideas and practices.\nThe IWA exists to this day, but with very little influence. At most, it is a \"flicker of history, the custodian of doctrine\" according to Wayne Thorpe. Among its member organizations is the British Solidarity Federation, which was formed in 1994, but has roots going back to 1950. It also includes the German Free Workers' Union (\"Freie Arbeiterinnen- und Arbeiter-Union\", FAU). It was formed to carry on the FAUD's tradition in 1977, but has a membership of just 350 as of 2011. Spain has several syndicalist federations, including the CNT, which is still part of the IWA and has around 50,000 members as of 2018. After being defeated in the Civil War, tens of thousands of CNT militants went into exile, mostly in France. In exile, the organization atrophied, with just 5,000 mostly older members by 1960. During Spain's transition to democracy, the CNT was revived with a peak membership of over 300,000 in 1978. However, it was soon weakened, first by accusations of having been involved in the bombing of a nightclub, then by a schism. Members who favored participation in state-sponsored union elections left and formed an organization they would eventually name the General Confederation of Labor (\"Confederación General del Trabajo\", CGT). Despite these concessions, the CGT still views itself as an anarcho-syndicalist organization and has around 100,000 members as of 2018.\n\nAccording to Darlington, syndicalism left a legacy that was widely admired by labor and political activists in a number of countries. For example, the IWW song \"Solidarity Forever\" became part of the American labor movement's canon. The strike wave, including the recruitment of unskilled and foreign-born workers by the Congress of Industrial Organizations, that swept the United States in the 1930s followed in the IWW's footsteps. The tactic of the sit-down strike, made famous by the United Auto Workers in the Flint sit-down strike, was pioneered by Wobblies in 1906.\n\nStearns, in his study of French syndicalism, concludes that it was a dismal failure. The radicalism of syndicalist labor leaders, he claims, shocked French workers and the government and thereby weakened the labor movement as a whole. Syndicalism was most popular among workers not yet fully integrated into modern capitalist industry, but most French workers had adapted to this system and accepted it, according to Stearns. Therefore, syndicalism was not able to seriously challenge prevailing conditions or even scare politicians and employers.\n\n\n\n\n"}
