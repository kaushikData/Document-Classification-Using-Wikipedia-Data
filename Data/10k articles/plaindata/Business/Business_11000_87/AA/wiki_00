SWOT is a strategic planning method used to evaluate the Strengths, Weaknesses/Limitations, Opportunities, and Threats involved in a project or in a business venture. The origin of the term SWOT remains obscure.\n\nAlbert Humphrey was educated at the University of Illinois, where he graduated with a B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering. After this he gained a master's degree in chemical engineering at M.I.T. and an MBA at Harvard University.\n\nHis work at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) produced a team method for planning which created SOFT analysis and this was developed into SWOT analysis.\n\nOne client was W.H. Smith (1970–1987), which aligned its annual budget to long-range planning. This programme was the first to use the concept of employee involvement in business planning and can be seen as sowing the seeds for the Investors in People scheme.\n\nWhile continuing work at Stanford, Humphrey was involved with the team that came up with the Stakeholder Concept, which has often been referenced by business leaders, economists and politicians.

Filming began in April 2011 in New York City. It opened in U.S. theaters in September 2012.\n\nSixty-year-old magnate Robert Miller (Richard Gere) manages a hedge fund with his daughter Brooke (Brit Marling) and is about to sell it for a handsome profit. However, unbeknownst to his daughter and most of his other employees, he has cooked his company's books in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud. One night, while driving with his much younger mistress, Julie Cote (Laetitia Casta), he begins to doze off and crashes; Julie is killed. An injured Robert leaves the scene and decides to cover up his involvement to prevent the public, his wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon), and the prospective buyer James Mayfield (Graydon Carter) from discovering the truth.\n\nRobert calls Jimmy Grant (Nate Parker), a twenty-three-year-old man from Harlem with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past, and whose father had been Robert's driver for many years. After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife. The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer (Tim Roth). Bryer is keen on arresting Robert for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together. Brooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.\n\nJimmy is arrested and placed before a grand jury but still refuses to admit to helping Miller. Miller once again contemplates turning himself in. Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good. Eventually, the sale is closed, but Robert finds a way to avoid being charged. He proves that Bryer had fabricated evidence. The case against Jimmy is dismissed, and the detective is ordered not to go near him. Robert's wife tries to blackmail him with a separation agreement getting rid of his wealth. When Robert refuses to sign, his wife says that she will tell the police that he got into bed at 4:30 am on the night of the accident, bruised and bleeding but will tell them that he was there all night if he agrees to sign.\n\nIn the final scene, Robert addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter. As Robert approaches the podium to deliver his speech the screen cuts to black, leaving his decision ambiguous.\n\n\n\"Arbitrage\" was a worldwide box-office success and is the highest grossing \"day-and-date\" independently produced film of all time.\n\nLionsgate and Roadside Attractions paid $2.1 million to acquire the United States rights of this film, and they spent around $3 million promoting the film's theatrical and VOD release. The film went on grossing $7.9 million in the United States box office and $14 million in United States VOD sales. \n\nAs of 2014, the film had grossed over $35,485,056 in the global box office.\n\nThe film also outperformed financially in several areas: it set a record as the highest grossing \"day-and-date\" release of all time, meaning it outperformed all other films released simultaneously in theaters and \"on-demand\". It also opened to a per screen average in the United States in excess of $10,000, making it one of the highest per-screen average films of the year. It was the top film in Israel two weeks running and No. 3 in Spain two weeks running, nearing a Spanish theatrical gross of US$ 5 million. It broke independent box office records in many other countries including Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and Switzerland.\n\n\"Arbitrage\" was praised by critics and has a rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 151 reviews with the consensus: \"Arbitrage is both a tense thriller and a penetrating character study, elevated by the strength of a typically assured performance from Richard Gere.\" Many critics pointed out Gere's \"conflicted performance\" as a \"career-best\", and cited the screenplay, ensemble acting, and direction as high quality.\n\n\"Arbitrage\" was nominated for 7 awards and won 4.\n\nGere was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama at the 70th Golden Globe Awards for his performance in \"Arbitrage\".\n\nThe film won the following awards: National Board of Review - \"Top 10 Independent Films,\" African American Film Critics Association - \"Best Supporting Actor: Nate Parker,\" Hamptons International Film Festival - \"Breakthrough Performer: Nate Parker\"\n\nIt was also nominated for: Chicago Film Critics Society - \"Most Promising Filmmaker: Nicholas Jarecki\", Phoenix Film Critics Society - \"Best Original Screenplay: Nicholas Jarecki\", San Sebastian International Film Festival - \"Golden Shell: Nicholas Jarecki\"\n\n"}

It is formed by casting the monomer, methyl methacrylate, mixed with initiators and possibly other additives into a form or mold. Sheet and rod stock are generated by casting into static forms, while tubing is done in rotational molds.\n\nIt has better thermal stability, higher resistance to crazing (when a network of very small cracks form) when exposed to solvents, wider thermoforming range than extruded acrylic. Cast acrylic has better ability to be reworked hot and it is known for its superior surface finish and optical properties. Also cast acrylic is more scratch resistant than extruded acrylic.\nCast acrylic is also preferred over extruded in applications that require machining, such as turning on Engine Lathe or milling/drilling. Extruded acrylic, with far less thermal stability, tends to melt and clog cutting tools. Even with slow speeds and lots of coolant, extruded acrylic does not produce the surface finish and tight tolerances achievable with cast acrylic.\n\nThis type of acrylic is often used for aquariums, awards, financial tombstones, trophies, corporate gifts, and other products that require shaping or machining. It tends to be more clear and made to a higher quality standard, but in doing so makes it more expensive than extruded acrylic.\n\n"}

The brothers led the business – the world's largest advertising agency in the 1980s – until they were forced out in 1995. In the same year, the brothers formed a new agency called M&C Saatchi. \n\nSaatchi is also known for his art collection and for owning Saatchi Gallery, and in particular for his sponsorship of the Young British Artists (YBAs), including Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin.\n\nCharles Saatchi is the second of four sons born to Nathan Saatchi and Daisy Ezer, a wealthy Iraqi Jewish family in Baghdad, Iraq. The name \"Saatchi\" saatçi (\"sā'ātchi\"), which means \"watchmaker\", originates from Turkish. Saatchi's brothers are David (born 1937), Maurice (born 1946) and Philip (born 1953). \n\nIn 1947 his father, a textile merchant, anticipated the flight that tens of thousands of Iraqi Jews would soon make to avoid persecution and relocated his family to Finchley, north London. Nathan Saatchi purchased two textile mills in north London and after a time rebuilt a thriving business. Eventually the family would settle into an eight-bedroom house in Hampstead Lane, Highgate.\n\nSaatchi attended Christ's College, a grammar school in Finchley, north London. During this time, he developed an obsession with US pop culture, including the music of Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Chuck Berry. He has described as \"life-changing\" the experience of viewing a Jackson Pollock painting at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He then progressed to study at the London College of Communication.\n\nIn 1965, Saatchi undertook his first advertising role as a copywriter in the London office of Benton & Bowles, where he met Doris Lockhart (later his first wife). Saatchi paired up with art director Ross Cramer and they worked as a team at Collett Dickenson Pearce and John Collins & Partners before leaving in 1967 to open creative consultancy Cramer Saatchi.\n\nUnusually for a creative consultancy, they took on employees: John Hegarty – previously Saatchi's art director at Benton & Bowles, who would later go on to run rival agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty – and Jeremy Sinclair, who as of 2016 still retains a senior role at M&C Saatchi. In addition to offering consulting with ad agencies they also took on some clients directly.\n\nIn 1970, he started the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi with his brother Maurice, which by 1986 – following its acquisition of advertising firm Ted Bates – had grown to be the largest ad agency in the world, with over 600 offices. Successful campaigns in the UK included Silk Cut's advertisements in preparation for the ban on named tobacco advertising, and the Conservative Party's 1979 general election victory – led by Margaret Thatcher through the slogan \"Labour Isn't Working\".\n\nAt the turn of 1995, Saatchi and his brother left the agency, and together founded the rival M&C Saatchi agency, taking with them many of their management and creative staff, as well as a number of clients – including British Airways.\n\nIn 1969, at age 26, Saatchi purchased his first work of art by Sol LeWitt, a New York minimalist. Saatchi initially patronised the Lisson Gallery in Marylebone, London, which specialised in American minimalist works. He later purchased an entire show by Robert Mangold.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Saatchi purchased a cement-floored and steel-girded warehouse at 98A Boundary Road in the residential London suburb of St. John's Wood. The building was transformed by architect Max Gordon into the Saatchi Gallery, which was subsequently opened to the public in February 1985 to exhibit the art Saatchi had collected.\n\nAt one point the Saatchi collection contained 11 works by Donald Judd, 21 by Sol LeWitt, 23 by Anselm Kiefer, 17 Andy Warhols and 27 by Julian Schnabel.\n\nHis taste has mutated from American abstraction and minimalism to the Young British Artists (YBAs), whose work he first saw at Goldsmith's Art School. At the YBAs' 1990 \"Gambler\" exhibition, Saatchi bought Damian Hirst's first major 'animal' installation, \"A Thousand Years\". In 1991, he acquired major artworks by Hirst and Marc Quinn, becoming instrumental in launching their careers. His renown as a patron peaked in 1997, when part of his collection was shown at the Royal Academy as the exhibition \"Sensation\", which travelled to Berlin and New York causing headlines and some offence (for example, to the families of children murdered by Myra Hindley, who was portrayed in one of the works), and consolidating the position of Hirst, Emin and other YBAs.\n\nIn 2009, he published the book \"My Name Is Charles Saatchi And I Am An Artoholic\". Subtitled \"Everything You Need To Know About Art, Ads, Life, God And Other Mysteries And Weren't Afraid To Ask\", it presents Saatchi's answers to a number of questions submitted by members of the public and journalists.\n\nFrom November to December 2009, he had a television programme on the BBC called \"School of Saatchi\" in which he gave young aspiring artists an opportunity to showcase their work. He made no appearance in the programme, only communicating through an assistant.\n\nIn July 2010, Charles Saatchi announced he would be donating the Saatchi Gallery and over 200 works of art to the British public.\n\nThe Saatchi Gallery featured in a list of the most visited art museums in the world, based on an attendance survey for 2014, compiled by \"The Art Newspaper,\" with 1,505,608 visitors. In the same survey, the gallery was shown to have hosted 15 of the 20 most visited exhibitions in London over the last 5 years.\n\nBooks published by Charles Saatchi include:\n\n\"Looking Over Your Opponent's Shoulder.\" (1998) Bow Publications. \n\n\"Charles Saatchi: Question.\" (2010) Phaidon. \n\n\"My Name Is Charles Saatchi And I Am An Artoholic.\" (2012) Phaidon. \n\n\"Be the Worst You Can be: Life's Too Long for Patience and Virtue.\" (2012) Abrams. \n\n\"The Naked Eye.

The donation was estimated to be worth £30 million.\n\nHe has donated over 100 works to the Tate Gallery, Art for Hospitals and the Arts Council.\n\nAccording to the \"Times Online\", Saatchi is \"reclusive\", even hiding from clients when they visited his agency's offices and, as of February 2009, has only ever granted two newspaper interviews. He does not attend his own exhibition openings; when asked why by the \"Sunday Telegraph\", he replied: \"I don't go to other people's openings, so I extend the same courtesy to my own.\"\n\nIn \"The Sunday Times Rich List\" ranking of the wealthiest people in the UK, he was grouped with his brother Maurice, with an estimated joint fortune of £120 million.\n\nSaatchi first met Doris Lockhart Dibley (as she was then known) in 1965 when she was a copy group head above him at Benton & Bowles. She was a native of Memphis, Tennessee, USA and Kevin Goldman describes her as \"a sophisticated woman who spoke several languages, knew a great deal about art and wine and who had graduated from Smith College and the Sorbonne\". She became known during their marriage as an art and design journalist, with particular knowledge of American art and minimalism. They lived together for six years before getting married in 1973 and divorcing in 1990.\n\nSaatchi's second wife was Kay Hartenstein (to whom he was married from 1990 to 2001) an American Condé Nast advertising executive from Little Rock, Arkansas. Together they have a daughter, Phoebe.\n\nSaatchi married his third wife, British journalist, author and cook Nigella Lawson, having drawn disapproval when she moved in with him nine months after her previous husband's death. In January 2011, Saatchi and Lawson moved from their former home in Belgravia to a new home in Chelsea, London. This was a double fronted seven-bedroom villa converted from its former use as a warehouse and 200 metres from Saatchi's contemporary art gallery in King's Road, London. They lived with her two children Cosima and Bruno, as well as Phoebe.\n\nIn June 2013, while dining at Scott's, a London seafood restaurant, Saatchi was photographed with his hand around Lawson's throat. The day after the pictures were published, Saatchi said they were misleading and depicted only a \"playful tiff\".\n\nIn early July of the same year it was announced that the couple were to divorce. Lawson cited ongoing unreasonable behaviour in her divorce petition. On 31 July 2013, seven weeks after the incident, Saatchi and Lawson were granted a decree nisi. They reached a private financial settlement. \"R v Grillo and Grillo\", a trial for fraud involving the former couple's two Italian-born personal assistants, sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, began on 27 November 2013.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6788", "title": "Chrysler Building", "text": "Chrysler Building\n\nThe Chrysler Building is an Art Deco–style skyscraper located on the East Side of Midtown Manhattan in New York City, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan. At , the structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before it was surpassed by the Empire State Building in 1931. It is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework. , the Chrysler is the eighth-tallest building in the city, tied with The New York Times Building.\n\nOriginally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the building was constructed by Walter Chrysler, the head of the Chrysler Corporation, and served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. Although the Chrysler Building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it, as Walter Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.\n\nWhen the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, ranging from its being inane and unoriginal to that it was modernist and iconic. Perceptions of the building have slowly evolved into its now being seen as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style; and in 2007, it was ranked ninth on the \"List of America's Favorite Architecture\" by the American Institute of Architects.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, New York's metropolitan area surpassed London's as the world's most populous metropolitan area. New York City's metropolitan area exceeded ten million by the early 1930s. The era was characterized by profound social and technological changes. Consumer goods such as radio, cinema, and the automobile—whose use grew exponentially in the 1920s—became widespread. In 1927, Walter Chrysler's automotive company, the Chrysler Corporation, became the third-largest car manufacturer in the United States, behind Ford and General Motors. The following year he was named \"Time\" magazine's \"Person of the Year\".\n\nThe economic boom of the 1920s and speculation in the real estate market fostered a wave of new skyscraper projects in New York City. The Chrysler Building was built as part of an ongoing building boom that resulted in the city having the world's tallest building from 1908 to 1974. Following the end of World War I, European and American architects came to see simplified design as the epitome of the modern era and Art Deco skyscrapers as symbolizing progress, innovation, and modernity. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before needing to be setback from the street. This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often elaborately decorated. Art Deco buildings were constructed for only a short period of time; but because that period was during the city's late-1920s real estate boom, the numerous skyscrapers built in the Art Deco style predominated in the city skyline, giving it the romantic quality seen in films and plays. The Chrysler Building project was shaped by these circumstances.\n\nThe land on which the Chrysler Building stands was donated to The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1902. The site is roughly a trapezoid with a frontage on Lexington Avenue; a frontage on 42nd Street; and a frontage on 43rd Street. The site bordered the old Boston Post Road, which predated, and ran aslant of, the Manhattan street grid established by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811. As a result, the east side of the building's base is similarly aslant.\n\nOriginally, the Chrysler Building was to be the Reynolds Building, a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds. Prior to his involvement in planning the building, Reynolds was best known for developing Coney Island's Dreamland amusement park. When the amusement park was destroyed by fire in 1911, Reynolds turned his attention to Manhattan real estate, where he set out to build the tallest building in the world.\n\nIn 1921, Reynolds rented a large plot of land at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street with the intention of building a tall building on the site. In 1927, after several years of delays, Reynolds hired the architect William Van Alen to build a forty-story building there.\n\nVan Alen was respected in his field for his work on the Albemarle Building at Broadway and 24th Street, designing it in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense over disagreements on how best to run the firm. The breaking point came after a 1924 article, in the \"Architectural Review\", that praised the Albemarle Building's design, which the article attributed to Van Alen, while ignoring Severance's role altogether. The architects' partnership dissolved acrimoniously several months later, with lawsuits over the firm's clients and assets lasting over a year. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance's more traditional architectural style would otherwise have restrained Van Alen's more modern outlook.\n\nBy February 2, 1928, the proposed building's height had been increased to 54 stories, which would have made it the tallest building in Midtown. The proposal was changed again two weeks later, with official plans for a 63-story building. A little more than a week after that, the plan was changed for the third time, with two additional stories added. By this time, 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue were both hubs for construction activity, due to the removal of the Third Avenue Elevated's 42nd Street spur, which was seen as a blight on the area. The 52-story Chanin Building, diagonally across the intersection from Reynolds's proposed building, was also under construction. Because of the elevated spur's removal, real estate speculators believed that Lexington Avenue would become the \"Broadway of the East Side\", causing a ripple effect that would spur developments farther east.\n\nIn April 1928, Reynolds signed a 67-year lease for the plot and finalized the details of his ambitious project. Van Alen's original design for the skyscraper called for a base whose first-floor showroom windows would be triple-height, and above would be 12 stories with glass-wrapped corners, to create the impression that the tower was floating in mid-air. Reynolds's main contribution to the building's design was his insistence that it have a metallic crown, despite Van Alen's initial opposition; the metal-and-crystal crown would have looked like \"a jeweled sphere\" at night. Originally, the skyscraper would have risen , with 67 floors. These plans were approved in June 1928. Van Alen's drawings were unveiled in the following August and published in a magazine run by the American Institute of Architects (AIA).\n\nEventually, this design would prove too advanced and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate design for the Reynolds Building, which was published in August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.\n\nWith the design complete, groundbreaking for the Reynolds Building took place on September 19, 1928, but Reynolds did not have the means to carry on construction. Reynolds sold the plot, lease, plans, and architect's services to Walter Chrysler for $2 million on October 15, 1928. That same day, the Goodwin Construction Company began demolition of what had been built. A contract was awarded on October 28, and demolition was completed on November 9. Chrysler's initial plans for the building were similar to Reynolds's, but with the 808-foot building having 68 floors instead of 67. The plans entailed a ground-floor pedestrian arcade, a facade of stone below the fifth floor, a brick-and-terracotta facade above, and a \"three-story observation dome\" with \"bronze and glass\" at the top. However, Chrysler wanted a more progressive design, and he worked with Van Alen to redesign the skyscraper to be tall. At the new height, Chrysler's building would be taller than the Woolworth Building, a building in lower Manhattan that was the world's tallest at the time.\nFrom late 1928 to early 1929, modifications to the design of the dome continued. In March 1929, the press published details of an \"artistic dome\" that had the shape of a giant thirty-pointed star, which would be crowned by a sculpture five meters high. The final design of the dome included several arches and triangular windows. Lower down, the design was affected by Walter Chrysler's intention to make the building the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters, and as such, various architectural details were modeled after Chrysler automobile products, such as the hood ornaments of the Plymouth (see ). The building's gargoyles on the 31st floor and the eagles on the 61st floor, were designed to signify flight, and to exemplify the machine age of the 1920s. Even the topmost needle was built using a process similar to one Chrysler used to manufacture his cars, with precise \"hand craftmanship\". In his autobiography, Chrysler says he suggested that his building be taller than the Eiffel Tower.\n\nMeanwhile, excavation of the new building's foundation began in mid-November 1928 and was completed in mid-January 1929, when bedrock was reached. A total of of rock and of soil was excavated for the foundation, equal to 63% of the future building's weight. Construction of the building proper began on January 21, 1929. The Carnegie Steel Company provided the steel beams, the first of which was installed on March 27, and by April 9, the first upright beams had been set into place. The steel structure was \"a few floors\" high by June 1929, 35 floors high by early August, and completed by September. Despite a frantic steelwork construction pace of about four floors per week, no workers died during the construction of the skyscraper's steelwork. Chrysler lauded this achievement, saying, \"It is the first time that any structure in the world has reached such a height, yet the entire steel construction was accomplished without loss of life\". In total, 391,881 rivets were used, and approximately 3,826,000 bricks were manually laid to create the non-loadbearing walls of the skyscraper. Walter Chrysler personally financed the construction with his income from his car company. The Chrysler Building's height officially surpassed the Woolworth's on October 16, 1929, thereby becoming the world's tallest structure.\nThe same year that the Chrysler Building's construction started, banker George L. Ohrstrom proposed the construction of a 47-story office building at 40 Wall Street downtown. Shortly thereafter Ohrstrom modified his project to have 60 floors, but it was still below Woolworth and the 808-foot Chrysler Building project as announced in 1928. H. Craig Severance, Van Alen's former partner and the architect of 40 Wall Street, increased 40 Wall's height to with 62 floors in April of that year. It would thus exceed the Woolworth's height by and the Chrysler's by . 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building started competing for the distinction of \"world's tallest building\". The Empire State Building, on 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, entered the competition in 1929. The \"Race into the Sky\", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, which helped fuel the building boom in major cities. The 40 Wall Street tower was revised from to 925 feet in April 1929, which would make it the world's tallest. Severance increased the height of his project and then publicly claimed the title of the world's tallest building. Construction of 40 Wall Street began in May 1929 at a frantic pace, and it was completed twelve months later.\n\nIn response, Van Alen obtained permission for a spire and had it secretly constructed inside the frame of his building. The spire was delivered to the site in four different sections. On October 23, 1929, one week after surpassing the Woolworth Building's height and one day before the catastrophic Wall Street Crash of 1929 started, the spire was manufactured. According to one account, \"the bottom section of the spire was hoisted to the top of the building's dome and lowered into the 66th floor of the building.\" Then, within 90 minutes the rest of the spire's pieces were raised and riveted in sequence, helping raise the tower's height to 1,046 feet. Van Alen, who witnessed the process from the street along with its engineers and Walter Chrysler, compared the experience to watching a butterfly leaving its cocoon.\n\nIn \"The Structure and Metal Work of the Chrysler Building\", an article published in the October 1930 edition of \"Architectural Forum\", Van Alen explained the design and construction of the crown and needle:\n\nThe steel tip brought the Chrysler Building to a height of , greatly exceeding 40 Wall Street's height. However, contemporary news media did not write of the spire's erection, nor were there any press releases celebrating the spire's erection. Even the \"New York Herald Tribune\", which had virtually continuous coverage of the tower's construction, did not report on the spire's installation until days after the spire had been raised.\n\nChrysler realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having ordered Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to the narrow steel spire. However, the Empire State's developer John J. Raskob reviewed the plans and realized that he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building, and subsequently acquired the nearby plots needed to support that building's height extension. Two days later, the Empire State Building's co-developer, former Governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.\n\nIn January 1930, it was announced that the Chrysler Corporation would maintain offices in the Chrysler Building during Automobile Show Week, and the first leases by outside tenants were announced in April 1930, before the building was officially completed. The building was formally opened on May 27, 1930, in a ceremony that coincided with the 42nd Street Property Owners and Merchants Association's meeting that year. In the lobby of the building, a bronze plaque that read \"in recognition of Mr. Chrysler's contribution to civic advancement\" was unveiled. Former Governor Smith, former Assemblyman Martin G. McCue, and 42nd Street Association president George W. Sweeney were among those in attendance. By June, it was reported that 65% of the available space had been leased. By August, the building was declared complete, but the New York City Department of Construction did not mark it as finished until February 1932.\n\nThe added height of the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass 40 Wall Street as the tallest building in the world and the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure. The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than ; and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states. The Chrysler Building was appraised at $14 million, but was exempt from city taxes per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. The city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, but Cooper Union had opposed that measure. Because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.\n\nVan Alen's satisfaction at these accomplishments was likely muted by Walter Chrysler's later refusal to pay the balance of his architectural fee. Chrysler alleged that Van Alen had received bribes from suppliers, and Van Alen had not signed any contracts with Walter Chrysler when he took over the project. Van Alen sued and the courts ruled in his favor, requiring Chrysler to pay Van Allen $840,000, or 6% of the total budget of the building. However, the lawsuit against Chrysler markedly diminished Van Alen's reputation as an architect, which, along with the effects of the Great Depression and negative criticism, ended up ruining his career. Van Alen ended his career as professor of sculpture at the nearby Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and died in 1954. According to author Neal Bascomb, \"The Chrysler Building was his greatest accomplishment, and the one that guaranteed his obscurity.\"\n\nThe completed Chrysler Building garnered mixed reviews in the press. Van Alen was hailed as the \"Doctor of Altitude\" by \"Architect\" magazine, while architect Kenneth Murchison called Van Alen the \"Ziegfeld of his profession\", comparing him to popular Broadway producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.. The building was praised for being \"an expression of the intense activity and vibrant life of our day\", and for \"teem[ing] with the spirit of modernism, ... the epitome of modern business life, stand[ing] for progress in architecture and in modern building methods.\" An anonymous critic wrote in \"Architectural Forum\" October 1930 issue: \"The Chrysler...stands by itself, something apart and alone. It is simply the realization, the fulfillment in metal and masonry, of a one-man dream, a dream of such ambitions and such magnitude as to defy the comprehension and the criticism of ordinary men or by ordinary standards.\" Negative critics included journalist George S. Chappell, who called the Chrysler's design \"distinctly a stunt design, evolved to make the man in the street look up\", and Douglas Haskell, who said that the building \"embodies no compelling, organic idea.\" Others compared the Chrysler Building to \"an upended swordfish\", or claimed it had a \"Little Nemo\"-like design. Lewis Mumford, a supporter of the International Style and one of the foremost architectural critics of the United States at the time, despised the building for its \"inane romanticism, meaningless voluptuousness, [and] void symbolism\".\n\nThe Chrysler Building's distinction as the world's tallest building was short-lived. John Raskob realized the 1,050-foot Empire State Building would only be taller than the Chrysler Building, and Raskob was afraid that Walter Chrysler might try to \"pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute.\" Another revision brought the Empire State Building's roof to , making it the tallest building in the world by far when it opened on May 1, 1931. However, the Chrysler Building is still the world's tallest steel-supported brick building. The Chrysler Building fared better commercially than the Empire State Building did: by 1935, the Chrysler had already rented 70% of its floor area, while the Empire State had only leased 23% of its area and was popularly derided as the \"Empty State Building\".\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Chrysler Corporation was never involved in the construction or ownership of the Chrysler Building, although it was built and designed for the corporation and served as its headquarters until the mid-1950s. It was a project of Walter P. Chrysler for his children. In his autobiography, Chrysler wrote that he wanted to erect the building \"so that his sons would have something to be responsible for\".\n\nThe Chrysler family inherited the property after the death of Walter Chrysler in 1940, with the property being under the ownership of W.P. Chrysler Building Corporation. In 1944, the corporation filed plans to build a 38-story annex to the east of the building, at 666 Third Avenue. In 1949, this was revised to a 32-story annex costing $9 million. The annex building, designed by Reinhard, Hofmeister & Walquist, had a facade similar to that of the original Chrysler Building. The stone for the original building was no longer manufactured, and had to be specially replicated. Construction started on the annex in June 1950, and the first tenants started leasing in June 1951. The building itself was completed by 1952, and a sky bridge connecting the two buildings' seventh floors was built in 1959.\n\nThe family sold the building in 1953 to William Zeckendorf for its assessed price of $18 million. The 1953 deal included the annex and the nearby Graybar Building, which along with the Chrysler Building sold for a combined $52 million. In 1957, the Chrysler Building, its annex, and the nearby Graybar Building, across 43rd Street, was sold for $66 million in what was reported to be the largest real estate sale at the time. In 1960, the complex was purchased by Sol Goldman and Alex DiLorenzo, who received a mortgage from the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1961, the building's stainless steel elements, including the needle, crown, gargoyles, and entrance doors, were polished for the first time. A group of ten workers steam-cleaned the facade below the 30th floor, and manually cleaned the portion of the tower above the 30th floor, for a cost of about $200,000.\n\nMassachusetts Mutual obtained outright ownership in 1975 after Goldman and DiLorenzo defaulted on the mortgage. The company purchased the building for $35 million. In 1978, they devised plans to renovate the facade, heating, ventilation, air‐conditioning, elevators, lobby murals, and Cloud Club headquarters in a $23 million project. This renovation was completed in 1979. They delegated the leasing of the building's space to the Edward S. Gordon Company, which leased of vacant space within five years. During Massachusetts Mutual's ownership of the Chrysler Building, the tower received two historic designations. The building was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and as a New York City Landmark in 1978, although the city only landmarked the lobby and facade. Massachusetts Mutual had opposed the city landmark designation because it \"would cause 'inevitable delay' in moving new tenants into the skyscraper\". At the time, the building had of vacant floor space, representing 40% of the total floor area. In September 1979, the building was sold again, this time to entrepreneur and Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, in a deal that also transferred ownership of the Los Angeles Kings and Lakers to Jerry Buss.\n\nThe spire underwent a restoration that was completed in 1995. The joints in the now-closed observation deck were polished, and the facade restored, as part of a $1.5 million project. Some damaged steel strips of the needle were replaced and several parts of the gargoyles were re-welded together. The cleaning received the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award for 1997. Cooke died in 1997, and debtors moved to foreclose on the estate's unpaid fees soon after. Tishman Speyer Properties and the Travelers Insurance Group bought the Chrysler Center in 1997–1998 for about $220 million (equal to $ million in ) from a consortium of banks and the estate of Jack Kent Cooke. Tishman Speyer Properties had negotiated a 150-year lease from the Cooper Union, and the college continues to own the land under the Chrysler Building. Cooper Union's name is on the deed.\n\nIn 2001, a 75% stake in the building was sold, for US$300 million (equal to $ million in ), to TMW, the German arm of an Atlanta-based investment fund. In June 2008, it was reported that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council was in negotiations to buy TMW's 75% economic interest, a 15% interest from Tishman Speyer Properties in the building, and a share of the Trylons retail structure next door for US$800 million. In July 2008, it was announced that the transaction had been completed, and that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council was now 90% owner of the building, with Tishman Speyer retaining 10%.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011, the building's energy, plumbing, and waste management systems were renovated. This resulted in a 21% decrease in the building's total energy consumption, a 64% decrease in water consumption, and an 81% rate of waste being recycled. In 2012, the building received a LEED Gold accreditation from the U.S. Green Building Council, which recognized the building's environmental sustainability and energy efficiency.\n\nThe Chrysler Building is considered a leading example of Art Deco architecture. It is constructed of a steel frame in-filled with masonry, with areas of decorative metal cladding. The structure contains 3,862 exterior windows. Approximately fifty metal ornaments protrude at the building's corners on five floors reminiscent of gargoyles on Gothic cathedrals. The 31st-floor contains gargoyles and replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps, the 61st eagles, a nod to America's national bird.\n\nThe Chrysler Building uses bright \"Nirosta\" stainless steel extensively in its design, an austenitic alloy developed in Germany by Krupp (a German acronym for \"nichtrostender Stahl\", meaning \"non-rusting steel\"). It was the first use of this \"18-8 stainless steel\" in an American project, composed of 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle. The steel was an integral part of Van Alen's design, as E.E. Thum explains: \"The use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in the carrying of rising lines and the diminishing circular forms in the roof treatment, so as to accentuate the gradual upward swing until it literally dissolves into the sky...\" Stainless steel producers used the Chrysler Building to evaluate the durability of the product in architecture. In 1929, the American Society for Testing Materials created an inspection committee to study its performance, which regarded the Chrysler Building as the best location to do so; a subcommittee examined the building's panels every five years until 1960, when the inspections were canceled because the panels had shown minimal deterioration.\n\nThe Chrysler Building's height and legally mandated setbacks influenced Van Alen in his design. The walls of the lowermost sixteen floors rise directly from the sidewalk property lines, except for a recess on one side that gives the building a \"U\"-shaped floor plan above the fourth floor. There are setbacks on floors 16, 18, 23, 28, and 31, making the building compliant with the Zoning Law of 1916. This gives the building the appearance of a ziggurat on one side and a U-shaped palazzo on the other. Above the 31st floor, there are no more setbacks until the 60th floor, above which the structure is funneled into a Maltese cross shape that \"blends the square shaft to the finial\", according to author and photographer Cervin Robinson.\n\nThe floor plans of the first sixteen floors were made as large as possible to optimize the amount of rental space nearest ground level, which was seen as most desirable. The U-shaped cut above the fourth floor served as a shaft for air flow and illumination. The area between floors 28 and 31 added \"visual interest to the middle of the building, preventing it from being dominated by the heavy detail of the lower floors and the eye-catching design of the finial. They provide a base to the column of the tower, effecting a transition between the blocky lower stories and the lofty shaft.\"\n\nThe ground floor exterior is covered in polished black granite from Shastone, while the three floors above it are done in white marble from Georgia. There are two main entrances, on Lexington Avenue and on 42nd Street, each three floors high with Shastone granite surrounding each proscenium-shaped entryway. At some distance into each main entryway, there are revolving doors located \"beneath intricately patterned metal and glass screens\", designed so as to embody the Art Deco tenet of amplifying the entrance's visual impact. A smaller side entrance on 43rd Street is only one story high. There are storefronts consisting of large Nirosta-steel-framed windows at ground level, with office windows on the second through fourth floors.\n\nThe west and east elevations of the building contain the air shafts above the fourth floor, while the north and south sides contain the receding setbacks. Below the 16th floor, the facade is clad with white brick interrupted by white-marble bands in a manner similar to a basket weaving. The windows, arranged in grids, do not have window sills, the frames being flush with the facade. Between the 16th and 24th floors, the exterior exhibits vertical white brick columns that are separated by windows on each floor. This visual effect is made possible by the presence of aluminum spandrels between the columns of windows on each floor. There are abstract reliefs on the 20th through 22nd-floor spandrels, while the 24th floor contains decorative pineapples.\n\nAbove the third setback, consisting of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear. At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions help counter a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders, which symbolizes both the Chrysler Corporation and serves as a visual signature of the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet and resemble hood ornaments installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.\n\nThe shaft of the tower was designed to emphasize both the horizontal and vertical: each of the tower's four sides contains three columns of windows, each framed by bricks and an unbroken marble pillar that rises along the entirety of each side. The spandrels separating the windows contain \"alternating vertical stripes in gray and white brick\", while each corner contains horizontal rows of black brick.\n\nThe interior of the building contains several innovative elements. The partitions between the offices are soundproofed and divided into interchangeable sections, so that the layout of any could be changed quickly and comfortably. Pipes under the floors carry both telephone and electricity cables.\n\nThe triangular-shaped lobby is regarded as a paragon of the Art Deco style, with clear influences of German Expressionism. Chrysler wanted the design to impress other architects and automobile magnates, so he imported various materials without giving consideration to the extra costs incurred. He covered the walls with huge slabs of African red granite. On the floor, he marked a path from the entrances to the elevators using travertine from Siena. Originally, Van Alen's plans for the lobby included four large supporting columns, but they were removed after Chrysler objected on the grounds that the columns made the lobby appear \"cramped\".\n\nThe lobby has dim lighting that gives it a somewhat subdued quality, although the appliqués of the lamps are striking and iconic. Both combine to create an intimate atmosphere and act to highlight the place. Vertical bars of fluorescent light are covered with Belgian blue marble and Mexican amber onyx, which soften and diffuse the light, to both illuminate and blend with the red marble walls. The lobby also contains four elevator banks, each with a different design.\n\nThe ceiling contains a mural named \"Transport and Human Endeavor\", commissioned by Edward Trumbull in 1930. The mural's theme is \"energy and man's application of it to the solution of his problems\", and it pays homage to the Golden Age of Aviation and the Machine Age. The mural is painted in the shape of a \"Y\" with ocher and golden tones. The central image of the mural is a \"muscled giant whose brain directs his boundless energy to the attainment of the triumphs of this mechanical era\", according to a 1930 pamphlet that advertised the building. The mural's Art Deco style is manifested in characteristic triangles, sharp angles, slightly curved lines, chrome ornaments, and numerous patterns. The mural depicts several silver planes, including the \"Spirit of St. Louis\", as well as furnaces of incandescent steel and the building itself. There is a wall panel dedicated to the work of clinchers, surveyors, masons, carpenters, plasterers, and builders. Fifty different figures were modeled after workers who participated in its construction. In 1999, the mural was returned to its original state after a restoration that removed the polyurethane coating and filled-in holes added in the 1970s.\n\nPresently, the lobby is the only publicly accessible part of the Chrysler Building. When the building opened, the first and second floors housed a public exhibition of Chrysler vehicles. This exhibition was closed before World War II.\n\nThere are 32 elevators in the skyscraper, clustered into groups of six or eight. At the time of opening, 28 of these elevators were for passenger use. Each bank serves different floors within the building, with several \"express\" elevators going from the lobby to a few landings in between, while \"local\" elevators connect the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings. As per Walter Chrysler's wishes, the elevators were designed to run at a rate of , despite the speed restriction enforced in all city elevators at the time. This restriction was loosened soon after the Empire State Building opened in 1931, as that building had also been equipped with high-speed elevators. The Chrysler Building also had three of the longest elevator shafts in the world at the time of completion.\n\nOver the course of a year, Van Alen painstakingly designed these elevators with the assistance of L.T.M. Ralston, who was in charge of developing the elevator cabs' mechanical parts. The cabs were manufactured by the Otis Elevator Company, while the doors were made by the Tyler Company. The dimensions of each elevator were deep by wide. The doors are made of metal and covered with eight types of exotic woods. When the doors are closed, they resemble \"tall fans set off by metallic palm fronds rising through a series of silver parabolas, whose edges were set off by curved lilies\" from the outside, as noted by Curcio. However, when a set of doors is open, the cab behind the doors resembles \"an exquisite Art Deco room\". These elements were influenced by Egyptian designs, which significantly impacted the Art Deco style. According to Vincent Curcio, \"these elevator interiors were perhaps the single most beautiful and, next to the dome, the most important feature of the entire building.\"\n\nEven though the woods in the elevator cabs were arranged in four basic patterns, each cab had a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that \"if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [the elevators] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences on the design of the entire building.\" The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans. Curcio wrote that these elevators \"are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and it is fair to say that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them\". Curcio compared the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry.\n\nOn the 42nd Street side of the Chrysler Building, a staircase from the street leads directly under the building to the New York City Subway station at Grand Central–42nd Street. It is part of the structure's original design. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to block construction of the new entrance because it would cause crowding, but the New York City Board of Transportation pushed to allow the corridor anyway. Chrysler eventually built and paid for the building's subway entrance. Work on the new entrance started in March 1930 and it opened along with the Chrysler Building two months later.\n\nThe basement also had a \"hydrozone water bottling unit\" that would filter tap water into drinkable water for the building's tenants. The drinkable water would then be bottled and shipped to higher floors.\n\nThe private Cloud Club formerly occupied the 66th through 68th floors. It opened in July 1930 with some three hundred members, all wealthy males who formed the city's elite. Its creation was spurred by Texaco's wish for a proper restaurant for its executives prior to renting fourteen floors in the building. The Cloud Club was a compromise between William van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes. A member had to be elected, and if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee.\n\nThere was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th floor with oak paneling, and an old English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors. The main dining room, located on the 67th floor, was connected to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliqués in Art Deco style. There was a mural of a cloud on the ceiling, and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side. It is believed that the dining room was an inspiration for the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both located at 30 Rockefeller Center. On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private dining rooms. The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, members left the Cloud Club for other clubs. Texaco, whose executives comprised most of the Cloud Club's membership, moved to Westchester County in 1977, and the club closed two years later. Although there have been several projects to rehabilitate the club or transform it into a disco or a gastronomic club, these plans have never materialized, as then-owner Cooke reportedly did not want a \"conventional\" restaurant operating within the old club. Tishman Speyer rented the top two floors of the old Cloud Club. The old staircase has been removed, as have many of the original decorations, which prompted objections from the Art Deco Society of New York.\n\nOriginally, Walter Chrysler had a two-story apartment on the 69th and 70th floors with a fireplace and a private office. The office also contained a gymnasium and the loftiest bathrooms in the city. Chrysler also had a unit on the 58th through 60th floors, which served as his residence. However, Chrysler did not use his gym much, instead choosing to stay at the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters in Detroit. Later, the 69th and 70th floors were converted into a dental clinic. In 2005, a \"New York Times\" report found that one of the dentists, Charles Weiss, had operated at the clinic's current rooftop location since 1969. The office still had the suite's original bathroom and gymnasium.\n\nFrom the building's opening until 1945 it contained a observation deck on the 71st floor, called \"Celestial\". For fifty cents visitors could transit its circumference through a corridor with vaulted ceilings painted with celestial motifs and bedecked with small hanging glass planets. The center of the observatory contained the toolbox that Walter P. Chrysler used at the beginning of his career as a mechanic; it was later preserved at the Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan. An image of the building resembling a rocket hung above it. According to a contemporary brochure views of up to were possible on a clear day; but the small triangular windows of the observatory created strange angles that made viewing difficult, depressing traffic. When the Empire State Building opened in 1931 with two observatories at a higher elevation the Chrysler observatory lost its clientele.\n\nAfter the observatory closed it was used to house radio and television broadcasting equipment. Since 1986 the old observatory has housed the office of architects Harvey Morse and Cooperwood Interests.\n\nThe Chrysler Building is renowned for, and recognized by, its terraced crown, which is an extension of the main tower. Composed of seven radiating terraced arches, Van Alen's design of the crown is a cruciform groin vault of seven concentric members with transitioning setbacks, mounted one behind another. The entire crown is clad with Nirosta steel, ribbed and riveted in a radiating sunburst pattern with many triangular vaulted windows, transitioning into smaller segments of the seven narrow setbacks of the terraced crown. Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors.\n\nAccording to Robinson, \"Its 'dormers', each smaller and higher than the previous one, continue the wedding-cake layering of the building itself. This concept is carried forward from the 61st floor, whose eagle gargoyles echo the treatment of the 31st, to the spire, which extends the concept of 'higher and narrower' forward to infinite height and infinitesimal width. This unique treatment emphasizes the building's height, giving it an other worldly atmosphere reminiscent of the fantastic architecture of Coney Island or the Far East.\"\n\nAbove the 71st floor, the stories of the building are designed mostly for exterior appearance, functioning mainly as landings for the stairway to the spire and do not contain office space. They are very narrow, have low and sloping roofs, and are only used to house radio transmitters and other mechanical and electrical equipment. For example, the 73rd floor houses the motors of the elevators and a water tank, of which are reserved for extinguishing fires.\n\nTelevision station WCBS-TV (Channel 2) originated its transmission from the top of the Chrysler Building in 1938. WCBS-TV transmissions were shifted to the Empire State Building in 1960 in response to competition from RCA's transmitter on that building. For many years WPAT-FM and WTFM (now WKTU) also transmitted from the Chrysler Building, but their move to the Empire State Building by the 1970s ended commercial broadcasting from the structure.\n\nThe crown and spire are illuminated by a combination of fluorescent lights framing the crown's distinctive triangular windows and colored floodlights that face toward the building, allowing it to be lit in a variety of schemes for special occasions. The V-shaped fluorescent \"tube lighting\" – hundreds of 480V 40W bulbs framing 120 window openings – was added in 1981, although it had been part of the original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2 a.m., but \"New York Observer\" columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6 a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, turning off their lights during bird migration seasons.\n\nChrysler Center is the name of the building complex consisting of the Chrysler Building, Chrysler Building East, and the commercial pavilion located between the two, called Chrysler Trylons. In 1998, Tishman Speyer acquired the entire complex and proceeded to renovate it completely over the next two years.\n\nThe Chrysler Building annex at 666 Third Avenue, also known as the Kent Building at the time, was renovated and renamed Chrysler Building East. This International Style building, built in 1952, is high and has 32 floors. The mechanical systems were modernized and the interior was modified. Renowned architect Philip Johnson replaced the glass facade with darker glass and added a extension. After the addition, the total area of this building was .\n\nFinally, a new building, which was also designed by Philip Johnson, was built between the original skyscraper and the annex. This became the Chrysler Trylons, a commercial pavilion three stories high with a retail area of . Its design, consisting of three triangular glass pyramids that intersect each other, was inspired by the triangular windows of the Chrysler Building's crown. The building's design was so complex that a replica was built at Rimouski, Quebec. Johnson designed Chrysler Trylons as \"a monument for 42nd Street [...] to give you the top of the Chrysler Building at street level.\"\n\nAfter these modifications, the total leasable area of the complex was . The total cost of this project was about one hundred million dollars. This renovation has won several awards and commendations, including an Energy Star rating from the Environmental Protection Agency; a LEED Gold designation; and the Skyscraper Museum Outstanding Renovation Award of 2001.\n\nGeorge H. Douglas writes that the building \"remains one of the most appealing and awe-inspiring of skyscrapers\". Architect Le Corbusier called the building \"hot jazz in stone and steel\". Ada Louise Huxtable, an architectural critic, noted that the building had \"a wonderful, decorative, evocative aesthetic\", while another architectural critic, Paul Goldberger, noted the \"compressed, intense energy\" of the lobby, the \"magnificent\" elevators, and the \"magical\" view from the crown. The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission said that the tower \"embodies the romantic essence of the New York City skyscraper\". The travel guide \"Frommer's\" gave the building an \"exceptional\" recommendation, with author Pauline Frommer writing, \"In the Chrysler Building we see the roaring-twenties version of what Alan Greenspan called 'irrational exuberance'—a last burst of corporate headquarter building before stocks succumbed to the thudding crash of 1929.\"\n\nThe Chrysler Building appears in several films set in New York and is widely considered one of the most positively acclaimed buildings in the city. A 1996 survey of New York architects revealed it as their favorite, and the \"New York Times\" described it in 2005 as \"the single most important emblem of architectural imagery on the New York skyline\". In the summer of 2005, the Skyscraper Museum in Lower Manhattan asked 100 architects, builders, critics, engineers, historians, and scholars, among others, to choose their 10 favorites among 25 of the city's towers. The Chrysler Building came in first place, with 90% of respondents placing it on their ballots. In 2007, the building ranked ninth among 150 buildings in the AIA's \"List of America's Favorite Architecture\".\n\nThe Chrysler Building is widely heralded as an Art Deco icon. \"Fodor's New York City 2010\" described the building as being \"one of the great art deco masterpieces\" which \"wins many a New Yorker's vote for the city's most iconic and beloved skyscraper\". \"Frommer's\" states that the Chrysler was \"one of the most impressive Art Deco buildings ever constructed\". \"Insight Guides\" 2016 edition maintains that the Chrysler Building is considered among the city's \"most beautiful\" buildings. Its distinctive profile has inspired similar skyscrapers worldwide including One Liberty Place in Philadelphia and the Al Kazim Towers in Dubai.\n\nWhile seen in many films, the Chrysler Building almost never appears as a main setting in them, prompting architect and author James Sanders to quip it should win \"the Award for Best Supporting Skyscraper\". The building was supposed to be featured in the 1933 film \"King Kong\", but only makes a cameo at the end thanks to its producers opting for the Empire State Building in a central role. The Chrysler Building notably appears in the background of \"The Wiz\" (1978); as the setting of much of \"Q - The Winged Serpent\" (1982); in the initial credits of \"The Shadow of the Witness\" (1987); and during or after apocalyptic events in \"Independence Day\" (1996), \"Armageddon\" (1998), \"Deep Impact\" (1998), and \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" (2001). The building also appears in other films, such as \"Spider-Man\" (2002), \"\" (2007), \"Two Weeks Notice\" (2002), and \"Men in Black 3\" (2012).\n\nThe Chrysler Building is frequently the subject of photographers. In December 1929, Walter Chrysler hired the famed Margaret Bourke-White to capture it for publicity purposes. She took the images from a scaffold meters high and worked in a studio at ground level until she was evicted in 1934. According to one account, Bourke-White wanted to live in the building for the duration of the photo shoot, but the only person able to do so was the janitor, so she was instead relegated to co-leasing a studio with Time Inc. In 1930, several of her photographs were used in a special report on skyscrapers in the then-new \"Fortune\" magazine. In 1934, Bourke-White's partner Oscar Graubner took a famous photo called \"Margaret Bourke-White atop the Chrysler Building\", which depicts her taking a photo of the city's skyline while sitting on one of the 61st-floor eagle ornaments. On October 5, 1998, Christie's auctioned the photograph for $96,000. In addition, during a January 1931 dance organized by the Society of Beaux-Arts, six architects, including Van Alen, were photographed while wearing costumes resembling the buildings that each architect designed.\n\nThe building is also mentioned in the lyrics of several songs, as well as in the number \"It's the Hard Knock Life\" for the musical \"Annie\".\n\nThe Chrysler Corporation moved into the building as an anchor tenant in 1930, using its space as its divisional headquarters until the 1950s. Time, Inc. and Texaco oil were also original tenants. Needing more office space, Time moved to Rockefeller Center in 1937. \nTexaco relocated to Purchase, New York in 1977 in favor of a more suburban workplace.\n\nNotable modern tenants include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6426830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6426830", "title": "Edward J. DeBartolo Sr.", "text": "Edward J. DeBartolo Sr.\n\nEdward John DeBartolo Sr. (May 17, 1909 – December 19, 1994) was an American businessman. In 1971, his Ohio-based corporation was ranked as 47th among the nation's top 400 construction contractors. In 1983, DeBartolo was included on \"Forbes\" magazine's first Forbes 400 list of richest Americans.\n\nThe second of six children, DeBartolo was born in Youngstown, Ohio, a center of steel production that was also a major destination for immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. DeBartolo's parents, Anthony Paonessa and Rose Villani, had immigrated to the United States from Italy. DeBartolo never knew his biological father, who died suddenly before his birth.\n\nAfter Anthony Paonessa's death, Rose Villani Paonessa married Michael DeBartolo, and Edward took his stepfather's family name. Michael DeBartolo emigrated from Bari, Italy, with his family at age 17 and became a paving contractor and builder of warehouses and other structures. While a teenager, Edward DeBartolo began working, translating paving contracts for his stepfather, who did not read or write English.\n\nDeBartolo went on to earn a degree in civil engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Next came a decade of construction jobs with his stepfather. Capitalizing on his engineering skills, DeBartolo found himself serving in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. It was during the War, in 1944, that he married Marie Patricia Montani and incorporated his own company, The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation.\n\nAfter the war ended, DeBartolo served as president of Michael DeBartolo Construction and as founder and president of his newly formed company. DeBartolo was able to take advantage of dramatic changes occurring across the United States after World War II. As more Americans moved into suburbs, there was a corresponding increase in demand for convenient access to shopping. His first retail development was the construction of Gray's Drug Store and Sears, Roebuck and Co. department store in the \"Uptown\" area of Youngstown. DeBartolo's company was one of the first companies in the United States to build shopping centers in suburban communities. These shopping centers were initially plazas built as long strips, but soon DeBartolo began developing enclosed shopping malls as well, with brother Frank DeBartolo acting as architect.\n\nThe Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation was the undisputed leader in the shopping mall industry from the birth of the industry until DeBartolo's death, owning almost one-tenth of all mall space in the United States. DeBartolo also branched out into other types of urban development and construction, such as hotels, office parks, and condominiums. He established a work ethic of fifteen-hour days and seven-day weeks. He once told his senior executives, \"My wife has never seen me lie down while the sun was up.\" By 1990, DeBartolo was estimated to have more than $1.4 billion in personal wealth.\n\nA powerful strategic thinker, DeBartolo began acquiring department store chains in the late 1980s. In 1986, he helped finance Robert Campeau's purchase of Allied Stores Corporation, a department store holding corporation that owned such iconic department store brands as Jordan Marsh and Maas Brothers, as well as specialty stores such as Bonwit Teller and Ann Taylor. DeBartolo lent Campeau $150 million to bridge the financing gap for the acquisition. Campeau repaid the money, and in 1986, DeBartolo assisted in financing Allied Stores Corporation's acquisition of Federated Department Stores, a department store holding company and the owner of, among other assets, Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores. DeBartolo provided nearly $500 million in financing. In 1990, Federated went bankrupt, defaulting on the repayment of the loans made by DeBartolo; it emerged from bankruptcy after the ouster of Campeau in 1992 as a new public company under the name \"Macy's, Inc.\" During the course of the bankruptcy, DeBartolo's cash flow was severely impaired, due to Federated's nonpayment as well as the real estate recession of the time. DeBartolo's Federated positions were all realigned when Federated emerged from bankruptcy.\n\nIn 1988, he partnered with Dillard's Department Stores to buy Higbee's of Cleveland, Ohio. In 1992, William Dillard, founder of Dillard's, bought DeBartolo's share, except for the property interest in Higbee's Public Square flagship store in Cleveland (sold to Tower City in 2001), and renamed it the Higbee chain. DeBartolo's idea of a retail real estate developer going forward with new projects easily and quickly, by virtue of anchor stores which he owned, would never become a reality.\n\nAs a result of several years' impaired cash flow, DeBartolo prepared to take his company public as a real estate investment trust or \"REIT\". Most of DeBartolo's competitors were preparing to do the same, their operations suffering from a lack of capital in the private markets. In late 1993, the two largest shopping center companies at the time, DeBartolo and Simon were coming to the market simultaneously. Their advisors informed them that the capital markets could not absorb that much equity; either one of them must back down or prices would suffer severely. DeBartolo agreed to withdraw. In April, 1994, most of the properties owned by The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation were transferred to DeBartolo Realty Corporation, a public REIT, in its initial public offering. The new company was chaired by Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.; DeBartolo Sr. was unwilling to deal personally with the constraints of running a public company. In 1996, DeBartolo Realty Corporation was acquired by Simon Property Group, the public REIT formed by DeBartolo's longtime competitors, Melvin and Herbert Simon.\n\nDeBartolo's contributions to the campus at the University of Notre Dame include DeBartolo Hall (the main classroom building) and DeBartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC), both located on a quad that students refer to as \"DeBartolo Quad\". There is also a DeBartolo Hall on the campus of Youngstown State University (YSU), in his hometown of Youngstown, where DeBartolo has made many endowments to YSU. The DeBartolo Corporation continues to be based in nearby Boardman, Ohio.\n\nDeBartolo purchased the San Francisco 49ers in 1977, giving the team to his son. DeBartolo Jr. devoted significant resources to the team, became an expert in team management and player relations, and made it the most successful NFL franchise in the 1980s.\n\nDeBartolo founded the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League in March 1983, but folded the team after the first season (1984) when the league announced it would move to a fall schedule, the same time as the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe family also owned the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League from February 1977 until selling it to an ownership group led by Howard Baldwin in November 1991. His team would win the Stanley Cup in 1991. He would be engraved onto the Stanley Cup along with his daughter Denise DeBartolo York. DeBartolo said at a rally after the first win that the occasion \"possibly the happiest moment of my life.\"\nHe also owned the soccer team Pittsburgh Spirit from 1978 until 1986.\n\nWhile DeBartolo was unsuccessful in his attempt to purchase the Chicago White Sox in 1980, he owned and developed three thoroughbred racetracks – Thistledown in Cleveland, Remington Park in Oklahoma City, and Louisiana Downs in Bossier City, Louisiana.\n\nDeBartolo died of pneumonia on December 19, 1994 in Youngstown, Ohio at the age of 85.\n\n"}

In 2011, it invested an estimated €27,500 million in R&D in Europe. It directly employed 660,000 people and generated three to four times more employment indirectly (upstream and downstream).\nThe key contribution of the research-based pharmaceutical industry to medical progress is to turn fundamental research into\ninnovative treatments that are widely available and accessible to patients, with the goal of helping people live longer and be healthier. High blood pressure and cardiovascular disease can be controlled with anti-hypertensive medicines and cholesterol-lowering medicines, knee or hip replacements prevent patients from immobility, and some cancers can be controlled or even cured thanks to newer targeted medicines. Yet there remain huge challenges in many disease areas such as Alzheimer, multiple sclerosis, many cancers and orphan diseases.\n\nEFPIA also includes two specialised groups focusing on vaccines and biotechnology respectively:\n\nThe industry's efforts are focused around four key areas - the AIMS - Roadmap of priorities Access, Innovation, Mobilization, Security programme.\n\nIn 2010 the pharmaceutical industry invested about €27,800 million in R&D in Europe. After a decade of strong US market dominance, which led to a significant shift of economic and pharmaceutical research activity towards the US during the period 1995-2005, Europe is now also facing increasing competition from emerging economies. Today there is rapid growth in the market and research environment in emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India, resulting in further migration of economic and research activities outside of Europe to these fast-growing markets. The geographical balance of the pharmaceutical market – and ultimately the R&D base – is likely to shift gradually towards emerging economies.\n\nAll new medicines introduced into the market are the result of lengthy, costly and risky research and development (R&D) conducted by pharmaceutical companies:\n\nThere is rapid growth in the research environment in emerging economies such as China and India. The current tendency to close R&D sites in Europe and to open new sites in Asia will show dramatic effects to maintain the pharmaceutical discovery expertise in the EU. The United States still dominates the biopharmaceutical field, accounting for the three quarters of the world’s biotechnology revenues and R&D spending.\n\nIn 2007 North America accounted for 45.9% of world pharmaceutical sales against 31.1% for Europe. According to IMS Health data, 66% of sales of new medicines launched during the period 2004-2008 were generated on the US market, compared with 26% on the European market.\n\nSource: Eurostat\nEFPIA\n\nThe Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is a public-private partnership designed by the European Commission and EFPIA. It is a pan-European collaboration that brings together large biopharmaceutical companies, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), patient organisations, academia, hospitals and public authorities. The initiative aims to accelerate the discovery and development of better medicines by removing bottlenecks in the drug development process. It focuses on creating better methods and tools that improve and enhance the drug development process, rather than on developing specific, new medicines.\n\nThe European Commission and EFPIA have jointly established a new-non-profit European Community body. This organisation has a legal mandate to award research grants to European public-private collaborations conducting innovative research projects that focus on implementing the recommendation of the IMI Research Agenda.\n\nThe IMI Research Agenda was established under the lead of industry following intensive consultations with a broad range of stakeholders from across Europe. It identifies the principal research bottlenecks in the biopharmaceutical R&D process and sets forth recommendations to overcome these bottlenecks by focusing on four areas:\n\nIMI will make Europe more attractive for biopharmaceutical R&D investments and boost the competitiveness of European life science R&D.

Located on the Detroit riverfront, it served as a home to the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO) for more than 33 years and was an integral part of the city's Civic Center. With approval from Ford and the city, the building was demolished in July 2011 as part of the city's waterfront redesign plans.\n\nThe auditorium was financed by the Ford Motor Company and contributions of the Ford affiliated dealers in the U.S. Ford gave its approval when the city planned to remove the building as part of the waterfront redesign plans. The project received such a large donation from the Ford family, it was designed as a memorial to Henry and Edsel Ford. When the auditorium opened, it became home for the DSO and hosted conventions, pop concerts, theatrical productions and speeches. The building had outlived its usefulness to the city and was replaced by other facilities. The building acoustics were also not considered satisfactory.\n\nThe building was designed by the firm of Odell, Hewlett and Luckenbach in the modern style. It was situated at the base of a U-shaped drive named Auditorium Drive. Beneath the drive and adjacent landscaped areas was a two-level parking garage containing 750-spaces. The garage was accessed via ramps in the median of Jefferson Avenue and had a pedestrian entrance which provided direct access to the lower-level lounge of the auditorium.\nThe exterior shape of the building followed the form of its interior spaces with backstage and audience areas clearly visible. The sides of the building were clad in white marble to harmonize with the other buildings in the Civic Center Complex- the City-County Building, Veterans Memorial Building and Cobo Hall and Arena. The Jefferson Avenue and river facades were covered with a mica-flecked blue granite in a basket-weave pattern.\n\nIn the curved foyer of the main level were three sculptures by local artist Marshall Fredericks. On the curved wall above the main entrance is a 120-foot mural made of steel, copper and aluminum wire entitled \"Ford Empire\" which depicts the Ford Rouge Complex. Above the stairs to the balcony at the east end of the lobby was a piece entitled \"Harlequins, Ballerina and Orchestral Parade\" and above the west stairs was another piece entitled \"Harlequins and Circus Parade\". The Ford Empire mural was moved to storage in 2003 and in 2007, the Marshall Fredericks Sculpture Museum at Saginaw Valley State University negotiated with the City of Detroit to have the two smaller pieces moved there.\n\nOn February 14, 1965, the auditorium served as a historical stage for Malcolm X to deliver his last speech outside of New York before his death. He delivered his \"Last Message\" at the First Annual Dignity Projection and Scholarship Awards ceremony despite the firebombing of his Queens, New York home by the Nation of Islam that morning.\n\nFord Auditorium was demolished in July 2011 at a cost of $754,000 as part of the city's waterfront redesign plans.\n\nDemolition of the Ford Auditorium began on July 9, 2011 after being delayed a month because the city found more asbestos than expected.\n\nWhen first opened, the auditorium had a state-of-the-art recording system, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under Paul Paray made a number of recordings in the venue for Mercury Records. But it was also considered a very \"dead\" hall, with poor acoustics that resisted repeated attempts at improvement. After much discussion, the DSO returned to its former home, Orchestra Hall, in 1989. Ford Auditorium saw little activity thereafter, and by 1995, had stopped accepting reservations for use of its facilities.\n\nAccording to the Aeolian-Skinner archives, the auditorium's large Aeolian-Skinner organ was still in the building as of 2006, but had been unused for some time. It was installed in 1957 at a cost of $100,000. Helderop Pipe Organs, along with a team of volunteers, began to dismantle the organ in late June 2011, and finished late July 4, 2011, the day before demolition was scheduled to begin. The city donated the organ to the congregation of nearby St. Aloysius Catholic Church, which took the 2,800-pipe instrument with the goal of operating it within two years.\n\nA smaller 1,200-pipe organ which operated from the same console has been given to the DSO who will use it to perform 17th and 18th-century pieces in Orchestra Hall.\n\n"}

The business climate is a geometric mean of the balances of the business situation and the business expectations. To calculate the index value, the business climate the transformed balances are normalized to the average of the year 2015.\n\nAs an indicator of economic activity, the Business Climate Index is meant to supplement data from the official statistics, over which it has the advantage of being more frequently compiled and more rapidly accessible (GDP, for example, is only released quarterly and published with a delay of ca. two quarters, with the likelihood of subsequent revisions).\n\nThe particular importance of the Ifo Business Climate Index is forecasting turning points in economic growth. A cyclical turning point is reliably indicated following the \"three-times rule\", that is movement in a particular direction three months in succession.\n\nThe Index reached its lowest value in united Germany in March 2009 with 82.2 points. In December 2008 the \"business expectations\" component hit an all-time low of 76.9 points. The lowest level of the second component of the Index, \"business situation\", was at its lowest point in May 2009 with 82.5 points.\n\nThe all-time high of the Ifo Index was reached in December 2010 with 109.5 index points, surpassing the previous record high of 108.8 points in December 2006.

She is the fourth of five children of a Chinese Filipino couple: Johnny Co Lim (born Lim King Sing) and Magdalena \"Nelly\" Lim Luy.\n\nThe family lived in Binondo, Manila until December 1970, when Johnny Co Lim died, and Luy returned with her children to her hometown of Maluso, Basilan. Napoles, who was six at the time, studied at the Maluso Central Elementary School, and completed her secondary education at the local Claretian school. The family ran the Luys' sari-sari store, and delivered drinks to workers at the local port. However, some residents of Maluso have claimed that the Luys were a rich family, owning a fish drying business and plots of land. As the security situation in Basilan began to deteriorate, and the family received threats of extortion, the Lim family moved back to Manila.\n\nNapoles reportedly met her husband, Jaime G. Napoles, on board a ferry which traversed between the southern islands of Mindanao. They married in April 1982, when she was 18. In Manila, the couple lived in Fort Bonifacio, where the young Napoles ran a \"carinderia\".\n\nNapoles' business interests date back to the early 1990s. In 1993, she solicited for investments in a shipyard in Cebu, promising 5% interest on all investments. It was later discovered that the money was not invested in the shipyard: according to Col. Ariel Querubin, who was a friend of the Napoles family, the money they had invested in the shipyard was reportedly invested elsewhere, with Napoles pocketing the interest. While the investment was eventually recovered, Querubín claims the investment led to the death of his first wife.\n\nIn 2001, Napoles and her husband were implicated in the acquisition by the Armed Forces of the Philippines of ₱3.8 million worth of substandard Kevlar helmets, and were charged with graft and malversation of public funds by the Sandiganbayan (people's special tribunal). While her husband was dropped from the list of defendants in 2002, Janet Napoles stood trial, and was acquitted on October 28, 2010 for lack of evidence.\n\nIn 2013 it was revealed that Janet Napoles's JLN Corporation had paid significantly less taxes than the average local public school teacher. Records show that from 2009 to 2011, the company paid between ₱9,036-25,164 in annual taxes, whereas a public school teacher at that time would have paid around ₱35,952 per year.\n\nPDAF was a program initially implemented in 1990 which was designed to allow legislators to fund small-scale infrastructure or community projects which fell outside the scope of the national infrastructure program. It was later ruled as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the Philippines.\n\nNapoles has been linked with an alleged misuse of the Priority Development Assistance Fund, together with Philippine Senators Bong Revilla, Jinggoy Estrada, Juan Ponce Enrile, and other congressmen.\n\nJanet Lim Napoles was accused of illegally detaining Benhur Luy, her cousin and former employee in 2014. Luy's three-month custody under Napoles ended in March 2014. Napoles alleged that Luy took a ₱5.5-million loan under her name without her authorization. She also alleged that Luy was supposed to deposit ₱300,000 to her account but did not do so, accusing Luy of theft. Luy insists that he was detained by Napoles due to fears that Luy will expose Napoles' alleged significant role in the PDAF scam. Lim was later found guilty beyond reasonable doubt and was sentenced to \"reclusión perpetua\" on April 14, 2015. Napoles and her lawyers have indicated that they will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Office of the Solicitor General with the court of appeals has filed a \"manifestation in lieu of rejoinder\" recommending the Acquittal of Janet Lim Napoles from the Luy detention case.\nThis decision by the Solicitor General Jose Calida was backed by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte saying that he himself would move for the dismissal of the case citing selective prosecution under Aquino administration. The criminal actions must proceed against all responsible according to Duterte. \n\nJanet Napoles' husband was a major in the Philippine Marine Corps who participated in the God Save the Queen coup attempt against President Corazón Aquino. Originally a reservist, he later applied for active duty status, and eventually retired from the Marines on December 31, 2004. Together, they have four children, Jo Christine, James Christopher, Christian, and Jeane. Jo Christine Napoles is the president of the Metro Manila chapter of the OFW Family Club party list, and was the group's third nominee to the House of Representatives until she withdrew her nomination on August 8, 2013. Jeane Napoles has been criticized for her ostentatious lifestyle, including owning a $2 million unit at the Ritz-Carlton in Los Angeles while she studied fashion design at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. The Philippines Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a P17.88-million tax evasion case against Jeane Napoles.\n\nThere are conflicting accounts as to the net worth of the Napoles family. While Napoles has described her family as middle class, acquaintances in Basilan claim that her maternal family had old money, which she confirmed in an earlier interview as having inherited. Her extended family in Basilan, however, has denied her claims of such an inheritance. She has also claimed that most of her wealth was due to sound investments, mostly with coal trading in several countries but particularly in Indonesia.\n\nIn other disclosures made to the SEC, it was revealed that Napoles owned at least 28 houses in a number of cities in Luzon, with her family members also holding property in the United States. She also maintains, according to the Department of Justice, around 415 accounts with seventeen banks. The Napoles family also maintains a fleet of 30 vehicles, which are all registered under the flagship company of the JLN Group of Companies, JLN Corporation.\n\nNapoles is a member of the Roman Catholic Church and has close ties with a number of Catholic clergy. She maintained a home for priests in Makati which was run by Monsignor Josefino S. Ramirez, who previously served as rector of the Quiapo Church, where her mother funded the church's feeding programs for the poor. Ramirez reportedly brought the image of the Black Nazarene on a number of occasions to Napoles' house, where they would hear Mass, and has confirmed that he received from her a monthly stipend of ₱150,000, and lived in one of Napoles' houses. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila has distanced itself from Napoles, saying that the projects she funded were part of Ramirez's personal apostolate and are not official projects of the archdiocese.\n\nJanet Lim-Napoles was admitted to the Ospital ng Makati on March 31, 2014 for treatment of a uterine cyst. On April 1, 2014, she underwent a series of tests, including electrocardiography (ECG), two-dimensional echocardiogram (2D-echo) and an X-ray. The following day, she underwent a blood test, and a week later underwent an endometrial biopsy examination despite her high blood sugar levels.\n\n"}

In spring 2016, he was appointed Chairman of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, a post he left in advance in November 2017.\n\nÖstling has become known as a controversial political entrepreneur debater who makes bold statements. Over the years, he has separated politically from the time of youth when he belonged to the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, SSU.\n\nÖstling was born in Luleå. After graduating with a Master of Engineering degree (M.Eng.) from the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, and a Bachelor of Economics degree (BEcon) from Gothenburg School of Business, Economics and Law, he came in 1972 to the Scania AB division in Saab-Scania, where he advanced through a variety of positions. Among other things, he was responsible for long-term planning before he was appointed head of Scania AB in the Netherlands in 1983. In 1989 he was appointed head of the Scania and in 1994 when Scania broke out of the Saab Scania group and became an independent corporation, he was appointed CEO. Östling left his post as CEO of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles (which includes Scania AB) 2012 in connection with controversial statements that trade unions have no right of veto for a possible relocation of jobs. Östling continued on 1 September 2012 to a position in Volkswagen AG until September 2015.\n\nWhen Scania's former main investor Investor AB in the year of 2000 agreed that Scania AB would merge with their biggest competitor Volvo Trucks, Östling opposed that merger, just as in the fall of 2006 he had opposed German MAN's plans to buy Scania AB. When the EU Commission, referring to the European Union competition law (Volvo Trucks / Scania AB would practically have a monopoly on the truck market in the Nordic countries), stopped the merger between Volvo Trucks and Scania AB, Östling won that battle and was able, with support from Scania's new owner Volkswagen, to remain in Scania as CEO. Also, the MAN SE bid for takeover was rejected by the main shareholders, and Östling could continue as CEO after the Annual general meeting in May 2007.\n\nIn 2017 Östling participated in the SVT TV program \"Uppdrag granskning\", which showed that he had placed money abroad to avoid Swedish taxation. Also his comment in connection with that, \"Here you pay 20-30 million a year, what the hell do I get for the money?\", was considered inappropriate from a chairman of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise. Östling commented later on the following discussion with \"We have got a very narrow sense of corridor in Sweden if all political parties consider the political system to have unlimited taxation rights without the right of citizens to question how the money is used.\"\n\nÖstling has said that he believes it is \"genetically conditioned\" that so few women enter the engineering profession. He has also expressed his belief that the threat of global warming has been exaggerated and that the phenomenon is possibly caused by natural processes, which completely opposes the consensus in the research community that the current climate change is caused by human activity.\n\n"}

As one of Thailand’s most prominent businesswomen, Sampatisiri created one of the first international hotels in Bangkok, The Hilton International Bangkok at Nai Lert Park. Today the hotel is known as Swissôtel Nai Lert Park Hotel, Bangkok, and remains the flagship of the real estate portfolio of the group.\n\nWhen Sampatisiri was a young woman (1930s), her father sent her to Japan, because he predicted that economic power would be centered there in her generation. She could only attend a college as Japanese universities did not accept women at that time. When she returned to Thailand, her father send her to work for the Office of Civil Servants Commission to find out how the Government worked. After three years of Government service, she returned to the family business, living, as she describes herself, a \"life of privilege, rather than family duty, within Thailand's small economic elite\" even though she had many responsibilities as sole heir.\n\nSampatisiri's father died suddenly, when she was 27 years old, and she found herself at the helm of his business empire which included the White Bus Company which dominated the Bangkok's transport routes (including its canals) and the ice factories which supplied the majority of the city's population. When Sampatisiri took over she became the first and only female in the company, but she convinced the managers to stay and keep the company going. \n\nIn 1930, she married Khun Binich Sampatisiri, who himself came from a prestigious background of public service.

After the government nationalized the Bangkok bus companies, which included the family run White Bus Company, Lursakdi, then Khunying Lursakdi, was invited by Thanin Kraivichien, appointed Prime Minister by Royal Decree of King Rama IX on 8 October 1976, to join his cabinet as Minister of Transport thus making her the first female Minister in a Thai Government.\n\nLursakdi was, most recently, the chairperson of the business group that bears her father's name and also of the Lerd-Sinn Foundation which was created by her mother, Khunying Sinn, after the death of her father. The Lerd-Sinn Foundation, among other charitable activities, donated the proceeds used to build the Lerdsin hospital. She represented the first of three generations of women who shaped the Nai Lert Park hotel in Bangkok and provided the strategic direction of the Nai Lert Group. Her daughters, Bilhaiban Sampatisiri and Sanhapit Bodiratnangkura, as well as her granddaughter, Naphaporn Bodiratnangkura, were also engaged in the family business.\n"}

Mary was the daughter of railroad magnate E.H. Harriman and sister to W. Averell Harriman, former New York State Governor and United States Diplomat. In 2015 she was posthumously inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nMary Harriman Rumsey was born on November 17, 1881, the oldest of six children of railroad industrialist E.H. Harriman (1848–1909) and his wife, Mary Averell Harriman (1851–1932).\n\nHer siblings were Henry Neilson Harriman (1883–1888), Cornelia Harriman (1884–1966), who married Robert Livingston Gerry (1877–1957), Carol Averell Harriman (1889–1948), who married R. Penn Smith in 1917. After his death in 1929, she married W. Plunket Stewart, a racing stable owner in 1930, William Averell Harriman (1891–1986), who in 1955 became the Governor of New York and who married Kitty Lanier Lawrence, then Marie Norton Whitney (1903–1970), and lastly to Pamela Beryl Digby Churchill Hayward (1920–1997), and Edward Roland Noel Harriman (1895–1978), who married Gladys Fries (1896–1983).\n\nMary attended Barnard College, where she specialized in sociology and was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma.\n\nInspired by a lecture on the settlement movement, Mary, along with several friends, began volunteering at the College Settlement on Rivington Street in New York City's Lower East Side, a large immigrant enclave. Through her work at the College Settlement, Mary became convinced that there was more she could do to help others. Subsequently, Mary and a group of 80 debutantes established the Junior League for the Promotion of Settlement Movements in 1901, while she was still a student at Barnard College. The purpose of the Junior League would be to unite interested debutantes in joining the Settlement Movement in New York City.\n\nRealizing their lack of experience in dealing with the issues that faced people seeking help at the settlement house, Mary and League leaders brought together experts on the Settlement Movement to provide lectures and instruction to Junior League members. With better preparation came greater engagement leading to increased interest in membership by women notable in New York society; members would come to include Eleanor Roosevelt, Dorothy Whitney Straight and Ruth Draper.\n\nAs word of the work of the young Junior League women in New York spread, women throughout the country and beyond formed Junior Leagues in their communities. In time, Leagues would expand their efforts beyond settlement house work to respond to the social, health and educational issues of their respective communities. In 1921, approximately 30 Leagues banded together to form the Association of Junior Leagues of America to provide support to one another. With the creation of the Association, it was Mary that insisted that although it was important for all Leagues to learn from one another and share best practices, each League was ultimately beholden to its respective community and should thus function to serve that community’s needs.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, more Junior Leagues were formed throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Now known as the Association of Junior Leagues International Inc. (AJLI), the organization encompasses 292 member Leagues, with over 160,000 members committed to continuing the legacy established by its founder.\n\nIn 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Mary to chair the Consumer Advisory Board (CAB) of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), the first government consumer rights group.\n\nDespite her inexperience, Mary's work with farming cooperatives and belief in the power of cooperation would come to be her greatest assets. Mary would promote the formation of consumer groups across the nation and encourage these groups to report their grievances to her office.\n\nMary Rumsey's legacy to New Deal reforms would be continued by her younger brother, W. Averell Harriman. Averell was encouraged by his older sister to leave his finance job and join her and their friends, the Roosevelts, to advance the goals of the New Deal. Averell joined the NRA, marking the beginning of his political career.\n\nIn 1910, Mary married sculptor and polo player Charles Cary Rumsey (1879–1922), shortly after the death of her father on September 9, 1909. Rumsey had been working at Arden House, creating one of the principal fireplace surrounds, as well as other decorative sculpture. By all accounts, the two had a happy marriage. Together they had a daughter and two sons.\nCharles was killed in a car accident in 1922. Mary died in 1934 as a result of a horse riding accident which occurred while on a hunt near Middleburg, Virginia.\n\n"}

{"id": "692722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=692722", "title": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company", "text": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company\n\nThe Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is an American investor-owned utility (IOU) with publicly traded stock that is headquartered in the Pacific Gas & Electric Building in San Francisco. PG&E provides natural gas and electricity to most of the northern two-thirds of California, from Bakersfield almost to the Oregon border which represents 5.2 million households. PG&E is overseen by the California Public Utilities Commission. It is the leading subsidiary of the holding company PG&E Corporation which has a market capitalization of $13.27 billion as of 2018. It was founded by George H. Roe during the period after California's Gold Rush and by 1984 was the United States' \"largest electric utility business\". PG&E is one of three regulated, investor-owned utilities (IOU)s in California—the other two being Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric.\n\nIn the 1850s, manufactured gas was introduced in the United States as a means of lighting. Gasworks were built in the larger eastern American cities, but there was no gas industry in the West, however. In San Francisco, street lighting was available only on Merchant Street, in the form of oil lamps.\n\nThree brothers—Peter, James, and Michael Donahue—became interested in gas manufacturing while running the foundry that later became Union Iron Works, the largest shipbuilding operation on the West Coast. Joseph G. Eastland, an engineer and clerk at the foundry, joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find. In July 1852, James applied for and received from the Common Council of the City of San Francisco a franchise to erect a gasworks, lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with \"brilliant gas\". The council specified that gas should be supplied to households \"at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material\". The Donahue brothers and Eastland incorporated the San Francisco Gas Company on August 31, 1852, with $150,000 of authorized capital. The company became the first gas utility in the West. Its official seal bore the inscription \"Fiat Lux\"—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the University of California. There were 11 original stockholders, and the three Donahue brothers subscribed for 610 of the 1,500 shares.\n\nThe original location for the gas works was bounded by First, Fremont, Howard and Natoma streets south of Market, on the then shore of the San Francisco Bay. Work on the plant started in November, 1852, and it was ready for operation only a few months later. On the night of February 11, 1854, the streets of San Francisco were for the first time lighted by gas. To celebrate the event, the company held a gala banquet at the Oriental Hotel. Gas lighting quickly gained public favor. In the first year of operation, there were 237 customers. That number more than doubled the next year, to 563. By the end of 1855, the company had laid more than 6 ½ miles of pipe and 154 street lamps were in operation.\n\nThe growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies, including Aubin Patent Gas Company and Citizens Gas Company. These smaller companies were quickly acquired by the San Francisco Gas Company. However, one rival provided serious competition. The City Gas Company was founded in April 1870 by the Bank of California to compete with the gas monopoly held by the Donahue brothers' operation. City Gas began operation in 1872 and initiated a price war with the San Francisco Gas Company. In 1873, the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the Bank of California gained part ownership of \"the most lucrative gas monopoly in the West\". On April 1, 1873, the San Francisco Gas Light Company was formed, representing a merger of the San Francisco Gas Company, the City Gas Company, and the Metropolitan Gas Company.\n\nGas utilities, including San Francisco Gas Light, faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to California. According to a 2012 PG&E publication and their 1952 commissioned history, in 1879, San Francisco was the first city in the U.S. to have a central generating station for electric customers. To stay competitive, the San Francisco Gas Light Company introduced the Argand lamp that same year. The lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps, but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted. Meanwhile, the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of downtown San Francisco continued to grow. The first electric street light was erected in 1888 in front of City Hall, and the electrical grid supporting it was gradually extended. A second generating station was constructed in 1888 by the California Electric Light Company to increase production capacity.\n\nNew competition also emerged in the 1880s in the form of water gas, an improved illuminant patented by Thaddeus Lowe. The United Gas Improvement Company, a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the Lowe gas patents, acquired a lease and then an interest in San Francisco's Central Gas Light Company on November 1, 1883. United was acquired by the Pacific Gas Improvement Company in 1884. Under the management of president Albert Miller, Pacific Gas Improvement developed into a formidable competitor to San Francisco Gas Light. Horace A. Miller, Secretary and C. O. G. Miller (Christian Otto Gerberding Miller), President, owned and controlled not only the Pacific Gas Improvement Company but also the Pacific Gas Lighting Company (Pacific Lighting Company). C.O.G. Miller is buried in a Pyramid mausoleum at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland CA. Horace Miller built an enormous mansion in Piedmont, CA at 445 Mountain Avenue in 1913, designed by Arthur Brown, famous San Francisco architect.\n\nIn 1888, San Francisco Gas Light built its own water gas plant at the Potrero gas works. The manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum. The company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coal-gas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil. In 1891, the North Beach Gas Works was completed under the direction of San Francisco Gas Light president and engineer Joseph B. Crockett. The facility was the largest gas holder in the U.S. west of Chicago.\n\nIn 1896, the Edison Light and Power Company merged with the San Francisco Gas Light Company to form the new San Francisco Gas and Electric Company.Consolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation. Other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the San Francisco Gas and Electric Company included the Equitable Gas Light Company, the Independent Electric Light and Power Company, and the Independent Gas and Power Company. In 1903, the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting, the Pacific Gas Improvement Company.\n\nAccording to PG&E's 2012 history timeline on their webpage, the San Francisco Gas and Electric Company and the California Gas and Electric Corporation merged to form the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) on October 10, 1905. The consolidation provided the California Gas and Electric Corporation with access to the large San Francisco market and a base for further financing. The San Francisco Gas and Electric Company, in turn, was able to reinforce its electric system, which until then had been powered entirely by steam-operated generating plants, and could not compete with lower cost hydroelectric power. After the merger was formally completed, engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems. However, the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until 1911.\n\nPG&E began delivering natural gas to San Francisco and northern California in 1930 through the longest pipeline in the world, connecting the Texas gas fields to northern California with compressor stations that included cooling towers every , at Topock, Arizona, on the state line, and near the town of Hinkley, California. With the introduction of natural gas, the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities, though it kept some plants on standby. Today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by \"40,000 miles of distribution pipelines and over 6,000 miles of transportation pipelines\" serving \"4.2 million customers from Bakersfield to the Oregon border.\"\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at both Topock and Hinkley compressor stations, hexavalent chromium in the form of an additive was used in rust-prevention in \"the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through PG&E’s pipeline to northern and central California.\" These cooling waters were then disposed of \"adjacent to the compressor stations.\"\nIn 1952 Charles M. Coleman—who worked for PG&E's publicity department—completed his book entitled \"P. G. And E. of California: The Centennial Story of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, 1852–1952.\"\n\nPG&E was significantly affected by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The company's assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire. Its San Francisco Gas and Electric Company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss, as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered. Only two gas and two electric plants, all located far from the city, survived the destruction. These functioning facilities—including the new 4,000,000-foot crude oil gas works at Potrero Point—played critical roles in San Francisco's rebuilding efforts. Many of PG&E's utility competitors ceased operation following the Great Earthquake. However, the company's substantial capital allowed it to survive, rebuild, and expand.\n\nIn 1906, PG&E purchased the Sacramento Electric, Gas and Railway Company and took control of its railway operations in and around Sacramento. The Sacramento City Street Railway began operating under the Pacific Gas & Electric name in 1915, and its track and services subsequently expanded. By 1931 the Sacramento Street Railway Division operated 75 streetcars on of track. PG&E's streetcars were powered by the company's hydroelectric plant in Folsom. In 1943, PG&E sold the rail service to Pacific City Lines, which was later acquired by National City Lines. Several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service, and the track was abandoned entirely in 1947.\n\nDuring this same period, Pacific City Lines and its successor, National City Lines, with funding from General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California (through a subsidiary, Federal Engineering), Phillips Petroleum, and Mack Trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service. This consortium was convicted in 1949 of Federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines and its subsidiaries. The actions became known as the Great American Streetcar Scandal or the General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy.\n\nWithin a few years of its incorporation, PG&E made significant inroads into Northern California's hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities. These included many reservoirs, dams, ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the Sierras that were no longer commercially viable. By 1914, PG&E was the largest integrated utility system on the Pacific Coast. The company handled 26 percent of the electric and gas business in California. Its operations spanned 37,000 square miles across 30 counties.\n\nThe company expanded in the 1920s through strategic consolidation. Important acquisitions during this period included the California Telephone and Light Company, the Western States Gas and Electric Company and the Sierra and San Francisco Power Company, which provided hydropower to San Francisco's streetcars. These three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources. By the end of 1927, PG&E had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to 300 Northern Californian communities.\n\nIn 1930, PG&E purchased majority stock holdings in two major Californian utility systems—Great Western Power and San Joaquin Light and Power—from The North American Company, a New York investment firm. In return, North American received shares of PG&E's common stock worth $114 million. PG&E also gained control of two smaller utilities, Midland Counties Public Service and the Fresno Water Company, which was later sold. The acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel. The Great Western Power Company and the San Joaquin Company remained separate corporate entities for several more years. But through this final major consolidation, PG&E soon served nearly all of Northern and Central California through one integrated system.\n\nThe gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the American Southwest beginning in 1918. The fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce. While natural gas sources were abundant in Southern California, no economical sources were available in Northern California. In 1929, PG&E constructed a 300-mile pipeline from the Kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to San Francisco. The city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas. The transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on 1.75 million appliances. In 1936, PG&E expanded distribution with an additional 45-mile pipeline from Milpitas. PG&E gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities, although some plants were kept on standby.\n\nDefense activities boosted natural gas sales in California during World War II, but cut deeply into the state's natural reserves. In 1947, PG&E entered into a contract with the Southern California Gas Company and the Southern Counties Gas Company to purchase natural gas through a new 1,000-mile pipeline running from Texas and New Mexico to Los Angeles. Another agreement was reached with the El Paso Natural Gas Company of Texas for gas delivery to the California-Arizona border. In 1951, PG&E completed a 502-mile main that connected with the El Paso network at the state line.\n\nDuring this period of expansion PG&E was involved in legal proceedings with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the company's status as a subsidiary of the North American Company. As outlined by the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than 10% of their stock held by a public utility holding company. Though 17% of PG&E stock was held by the North American Company at this time, PG&E filed with the SEC to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that 17% ownership did not give the North American Company control and because the North American Company occupied only two board member spots. The North American Company backed PG&E's request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity. The request remained unresolved until 1945 when the North American Company sold off stocks that brought its ownership to below 10%. The SEC then ruled that PG&E was not a subsidiary of the North American Company. In 1948, the North American Company sold its remaining stock in PG&E.\n\nIn 1957, the company brought online Vallecitos Nuclear Center, the first privately owned and operated nuclear reactor in the United States, in Pleasanton, California. The reactor initially produced 5,000 kilowatts of power, enough to power a town of 12,000.\n\nIn addition to nuclear power, PG&E continued to develop natural gas supplies as well. In 1959, the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from Alberta, Canada to California, via a pipeline constructed by Westcoast Transmission Co. and the Alberta and Southern Gas Company on the Canadian side, and by Pacific Gas Transmission Company, a subsidiary of PG&E, on the U.S. side. Construction of the pipeline lasted 14 months. Testing began in 1961, and the completed 1,400-mile pipeline was dedicated in early 1962.\n\nPG&E began construction on another nuclear facility, the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, in 1968. Originally slated to come online in 1979, the plant's opening was delayed for several years due to environmental protests and concerns over the safety of the plant’s construction.\n\nTesting of the plant began in 1984, and energy production was brought up to full power in 1985.\n\nDuring the construction of the Diablo Canyon plant, PG&E continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the North to their service area in California. In 1972, the company began exploring possibilities for a 3,000-mile pipeline from Alaska, which would travel through the Mackenzie River Valley and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in Alberta.\n\nIn 1977 the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline project received approval from the U.S. Federal Power Commission and support from the Carter Administration. The pipeline still required approval from Canada, however. Plans for the pipeline were placed on hold in 1977 by a Canadian judge. Justice Thomas R. Berger of British Columbia shelved the project for at least 10 years, citing concerns from First Nations groups, whose land the pipeline would have traversed, as well as potential environmental impacts.\n\nIn 1984 the great-grandson of PG&E's founder George H. Roe—David Roe published his book entitled \"Dynamos and Virgins\" during the time when there was a growing antinuclear-power movement. David Roe, who was an environmentalist and the Environmental Defense Fund's West Coast general counsel, \"mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal- and nuclear-generating capacity was the only solution to the nation's energy needs.\" He based his arguments on an economic analysis \"aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity.\"\n\nAs of December 1992, PG&E operated 173 electric generating units and 85 generating stations, of transmission lines and of distribution system.\n\nIn 1997, PG&E reorganized as a holding company, PG&E Corporation. It consisted of two subsidiaries—PG&E, the regulated utility, and a non-regulated energy business.\n\nIn the later 1990s, under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants. The utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants, the Diablo Canyon Power Plant and a few natural gas plants, but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity. This had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices, while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost. However, the market for electricity was dominated by the Enron Corporation, which, with help from other corporations, artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher. This led to the California electricity crisis that began in 2000 on Path 15, a transmission corridor PG&E built.\n\nWith a critical power shortage, rolling blackouts began on January 17, 2001.\n\nIn 1998, a change in the regulation of California's public utilities, including PG&E, began. The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) set the rates that PG&E could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the CPUC.\n\nIn the summer of 2001 a drought in the northwest states and in California reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available. Usually PG&E could buy \"cheap\" hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the Bonneville Dam, etc. Drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state. Hot weather brought on higher usage, rolling blackouts. etc.\n\nWith little excess generating capacity of its own PG&E was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts. Because PG&E had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates. The CPUC refused to adjust the allowable electric rates. Unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market PG&E started hemorrhaging cash.\n\nPG&E Company (the utility, not the holding company) entered bankruptcy under Chapter 11 on April 6, 2001. The state of California tried to bail out the utility and provide power to PG&E's 5.1 million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price, and as a result, the state also lost significant amounts of money.\n\nThe crisis cost PG&E and the state somewhere between $40 and $45 billion. There is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual recall of California Governor Gray Davis.\n\nPG&E Company, the utility, emerged from bankruptcy in April 2004, after paying $10.2 billion to its hundreds of creditors. As part of the reorganization, PG&E's 5.1 million electricity customers will have to pay above-market prices for several years to cancel the debt.\n\nPG&E's utility-owned generation portfolio consists of an extensive hydroelectric system, one operating nuclear power plant, one operating natural gas-fired power plant, and another gas-fired plant under construction. Two other plants owned by the company have been permanently removed from commercial operation: Humboldt Bay Unit 3 (nuclear) and Hunters Point (natural gas).\n\nPG&E is the largest private owner of hydroelectric facilities in the United States including 174 dams. According to the company's Form 10-K filing for 2011, \"The Utility’s hydroelectric system consists of 110 generating units at 68 powerhouses, including the Helms pumped storage facility, with a total generating capacity of 3,896 MW ... The system includes 99 reservoirs, 56 diversions, 174 dams, 172 miles of canals, 43 miles of flumes, 130 miles of tunnels, 54 miles of pipe (penstocks, siphons and low head pipes), and 5 miles of natural waterways.\"\n\nThe single largest component is the Helms Pumped Storage Plant, located at near Sawmill Flat in Fresno County, California. Helms consists of three units, each rated at 404 MW, for a total output of 1,212 MW. The facility operates between Courtright and Wishon reservoirs, alternately draining water from Courtright to produce electricity when demand is high, and pumping it back into Courtright from Wishon when demand is low. The Haas Powerhouse is situated more than inside a solid granite mountain.\n\nThe Diablo Canyon Power Plant, located in Avila Beach, California, is the only operating nuclear asset owned by PG&E. The maximum output of this power plant is 2,240 MWe, provided by two equally sized units. As designed and licensed, it could be expanded to four units, at least doubling its generating capacity. Over a two-week period in 1981, 1,900 activists were arrested at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. It was the largest arrest in the history of the U.S. anti-nuclear movement.\n\nIn June 2016, PG&E announced that it plans to close Diablo Canyon in 2025. This will make California free of operating commercial nuclear power plants, but will mean the loss of 2256 MW of generation that produced over 18,000 GWh of electricity per year.\n\nThe company operated the Humboldt Bay Power Plant, Unit 3 in Eureka, California. It is the oldest commercial nuclear plant in California and its maximum output was 65 MWe. The plant operated for 13 years, until 1976 when it was shut down for seismic retrofitting. New regulations enacted after the Three Mile Island accident, however, rendered the plant unprofitable and it was never restarted. Unit 3 is currently in decommissioning phase. Based on PG&E’s schedule of planned decommissioning activities, which incorporates various assumptions, including approval of its proposed new scope, decommissioning of the Unit 3 site is expected to conclude in 2019. The spent nuclear fuel is currently stored at the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) on the plant site because of the United States Department of Energy's failure to find a suitable alternative to storing or disposing of the spent fuel.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric planned to build the first commercially viable nuclear power plant in the United States at Bodega Bay, a fishing village fifty miles north of San Francisco. The proposal was controversial and conflict with local citizens began in 1958. In 1963, there was a large demonstration at the site of the proposed Bodega Bay Nuclear Power Plant. The conflict ended in 1964, with the forced abandonment of plans for the power plant.\n\nBuilt in 1956, there are two natural gas/fuel oil units at Humboldt Bay Power Plant that produce 105 MWe of combined output. These units, along with two 15 MWe Mobile Emergency Power Plants (MEPPs), will be retired in the summer of 2010. The Humboldt Bay Generating Station, built on the same site, is set to take the older power plant's place in the summer of 2010. It will be producing 163 MWe using natural gas for fuel and fuel oil for backup on Wärtsilä Diesel engines. It will employ technology to produce 80 percent fewer ozone precursors and 30 percent less CO than the previous facility. The new design will also reduce water use by eliminating the need for \"once-through\" cooling.\n\nAs part of a settlement with Mirant Services LLC for alleged market manipulations during the 2001 California energy crisis, PG&E took ownership of a partially constructed natural gas unit in Antioch, California. The 530 MW unit, known as the Gateway Generating Station, was completed by PG&E and placed into operation in 2009.\n\nOn May 15, 2006, after a long and bitter political battle, PG&E shut down its 48-year-old Hunters Point Power Plant in San Francisco. At the time of closure, the maximum output of the plant was 170 MW. Residents of the impoverished neighborhood had been pushing for more than a decade to close the plant, claiming it contributed to above average rates of asthma and other ailments.\n\nPG&E broke ground in 2008 on a 660 MW natural gas power plant located in Colusa County. It began operation in December 2010, and serves nearly half a million residences using the latest technology and environmental design. The plant will use dry cooling technology to dramatically reduce water usage, and cleaner-burning turbines to reduce CO emissions by 35 percent relative to older plants.\n\nOn April 1, 2008, PG&E announced contracts to buy three new solar power plants in the Mojave Desert. With an output of 500 MW and options for another 400 MW, the three installations will initially generate enough electricity to power more than 375,000 residences.\n\nIn April 2009, PG&E's \"Next100\" blog reported that PG&E was asking the California Public Utilities Commission to approve a project by the company Solaren to deliver 200 megawatts of power to California from space. This method of obtaining electricity from the sun eliminates (mostly) the darkness of night experienced from solar sites on the surface of the earth. According to PG&E spokesman Jonathan Marshall, energy purchase costs are expected to be similar to other renewable energy contracts.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, regulatory and political developments began to push utilities in California away from a traditional business model. In 1976, the California State Legislature amended the Warren-Alquist Act, which created and gives legal authority to the California Energy Commission, to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed as an intervenor in PG&E's 1978 General Rate Case (GRC), claiming that the company's requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth. Furthermore, EDF claimed that PG&E could more cost-effectively encourage industrial co-generation and energy efficiency than build more power plants. As a result of EDF's involvement in PG&E's rate cases, the company was eventually fined $50 million by the California Public Utilities Commission for failing to adequately implement energy efficiency programs.\n\nSince Darbee took control of the PG&E Company in 2004, PG&E has aggressively promoted its environmental image through a variety of programs and campaigns.\n\nIn the early first decade of the 21st century, the CEO of PG&E Corporation, Peter Darbee, and then-CEO of Pacific Gas & Electric Company, Tom King, publicly announced their support for California Assembly Bill 32, a measure to cap statewide greenhouse gas emissions and a 25% reduction of emissions by 2020. The bill was signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on September 27, 2006.\n\nIn 2014 PG&E had a renewables mix of 28%. By 2016, 32.9% of PG&E's power sources were renewable.\n\nPG&E's Community Pipeline Safety Initiative (CPSI) essentially cut down hundreds of thousands of trees in California from Eureka to Bakersfield along their nearly 7,000 miles of gas transmission pipeline. PG&E did not conduct a CEQA review in any of these cities, and the total number of trees removed is known only to PG&E.\n\nDuring 2017, PG&E announced that 80% of the company's delivered electricity comes from GHG-free sources, including renewables, nuclear, and hydropower. Around 33% comes from renewable sources, thus meeting California's goal of 33% of electricity coming from renewables by 2020, nearly three years in advance.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1966, PG&E dumped \"roughly 370 million gallons\" of chromium 6-tainted wastewater\" into unlined wastewater spreading ponds around the town of Hinkley, California. PG&E used chromium 6—\"one of the cheapest and most efficient commercially available\"—at their compressor station plants in their cooling towers along the natural gas transmission pipelines.\n\nPG&E did not inform the local water board of the contamination until December 7, 1987, stalling action on a response to the contamination. The residents of Hinkley filed a successful lawsuit against PG&E in which the company paid $333 million— the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in U.S. history. The legal case, which was dramatized in the 2000 film \"Erin Brockovich\", became an international cause célèbre. In response, in 2001, at the request of the CalEPA, the Chromate Toxicity Review Committee was formed to investigate the toxicity of chromium-6 when ingested. In 2003 a Senate hearing revealed that the committee's members included expert witnesses from PG&E, who had influenced the final August 2001 report which found in PG&E's favor concluding that other reports were alarmist with \"spuriously high\" statistics and that further evaluation should be handled by academics in laboratory settings not by regulators. Through time the report was recanted but it set back regulation of chromium 6 for many years. In July 2014 California became the first state to acknowledge that ingested chromium-6 is linked to cancer and as a result has established a maximum chromium-6 contaminant level (MCL) of 10 parts per billion (ppb). In setting the regulations it was acknowledged that in \"recent scientific studies in laboratory animals, Hexavalent Chromium has also been linked to cancer when ingested.\" Previously, when older chromium MCLs were set, \"at the time Total Chromium MCLs were established, ingested Hexavalent Chromium associated with consumption of drinking water was not considered to pose a cancer risk, as is now the case.\"\n\nBy 2013 PG&E had cleaned up 54 acres, but it is estimated the remediation process will take another 40 years. PG&E built a concrete wall barrier that is about a half-mile-long to contain the plume, pump ethanol into the ground to convert chromium-6 into chromium-3, and have planted acres of alfalfa. They created a chicken farm to use the alfalfa. PG&E uses irrigation to maintain these large circles of green in the otherwise desert area, and was asked to stop because of the ongoing danger of residents inhaling chromium 6.\n\nIn 2015 the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region served PG&E with a new order \"to cleanup [sic] and abate the effects of the discharge of chromium waste or threatened pollution or nuisance.\" By the time of the report the plume had expanded to \"8 miles in length and approximately 2 miles in width, throughout the Hinkley Valley and into Harper Dry Lake Valley\", polluting new areas. In early 2016, the \"New York Times\" described Hinkley as having been slowly turned into a ghost town due to the contamination of the area with owners unable to see their properties.\n\nEpidemiologist John Morgan produced a 2010 report for the California Cancer Registry in which he argued that there was no cancer cluster in Hinkley related to chromium 6. In one study Morgan had claimed that cancer rates in Hinkley \"remained unremarkable from 1988 to 2008\" saying that \"the 196 cases of cancer reported during the most recent survey of 1996 through 2008 were less than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer.\" In 2013 the Center for Public Integrity found glaring weaknesses in Morgan's 2010 analysis that challenged the validity of his findings. \"In his first study, he dismisses what others see as a genuine cancer cluster in Hinkley. In his latest analysis, he excludes people who were exposed to the worst contamination.\"\n\nOn June 19, 1997 a Nevada County jury in Nevada City found PG&E guilty of \"a pattern of tree-trimming violations that sparked a devastating 1994 wildfire in the Sierra.\" \"PG&E was convicted of 739 counts of criminal negligence for failing to trim trees near its power lines—the biggest criminal conviction ever against the state's largest utility.\"\n\nOn the evening of September 9, 2010, a suburb of San Francisco, San Bruno, California, was damaged when one of PG&E's natural-gas pipelines that was \"at least 54 years old, 30 inches (76.2 centimeters) in diameter and located under a street intersection in a residential area...\" exploded sending a \"28-foot section of pipe weighing 3,000 pounds flying through the air, fueled by blowing natural gas.\" The blast created a crater at the epicenter and \"killed eight people and injured nearly five dozen more while destroying about 100 homes.\" The USGS reported that the shock wave was similar to a 1.1 magnitude earthquake. Following the event, the company was heavily criticized for ignoring the warnings of a state inspector in 2009 and for failing to provide adequate safety procedures. The incident then came under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). On August 30, 2011, the NTSB released its findings, which placed fault for the blast on PG&E. The report stated that the pipeline installed in 1956 that later burst did not even meet standards of that time. PG&E was charged with \"twelve criminal felony counts alleging violations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. PG&E pleaded not guilty to the \"criminal counts in both the initial and superseding indictments, opting to put the prosecutors to their proof.\" On April 1, 2014 a United States grand jury in San Francisco charged PG&E with \"knowingly and willfully\" violating the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act.\n\nIn August 2015 the California Public Utilities Commission levied a $300 million fine against PG&E which they paid. PG&E also \"refunded $400 million to gas customers and agreed to pay $850 million for gas-system safety improvements. It also settled more than $500 million in claims involving victims of the disaster and their relatives.\"\n\nIn October of 2017, PG&E was responsible for their own lines and poles starting twelve separate fires of the 250 that devastated Northern California. These fires were caused by \"electric power and distribution lines, conductors and the failure of\npower poles\". Pending further investigation, the following fires have been confirmed by CAL FIRE investigators to have been started by PG&E equipment: The Redwood Fire of Mendocino County, The Sulphur Fire of Lake County, The Cherokee Fire of Butte County, The 37 Fire of Sonoma County, The Blue Fire of Humboldt County, The Pocket Fire of Sonoma County, The Atlas Fire of Napa County and the Norrbom, Adobe, Partrick, Pythian and Nuns fires of Sonoma and Napa county.\n\nIn November 2018, PG&E and its parent company were sued in the San Francisco County Superior Court by multiple victims of the Camp Fire - the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.. The lawsuit accused PG&E of failure to properly maintain its infrastructure and equipment, which the lawsuit claims led to the fire. While the cause of the fire is still under investigation, PG&E acknowledged that they sent an \"electric incident report\" to the California Public Utilities Commission indicating a power failure on a transmission line on November 8, just 15 minutes before the fire was first reported near the same location. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and state utility regulators are investigating PG&E to determine if they complied with state laws in the areas burned in the fire.\n\nIn 2014, PG&E rolled out the \"Pipeline Pathways\" project which was later rebranded to the \"Community Pipeline Safety Initiative\". These projects were PG&E's $500 Million four-year effort to clear many of the trees that lie along the almost 7,000 miles of the high pressure gas distribution pipeline in California. PG&E's claims that removing trees were necessary to 1) provide emergency access should an incident occur under a tree and 2) protect pipelines from rupturing due to tree roots. Many communities have protested the removal of private and public trees. According to local opposition groups, PG&E's safety claims for tree removal are incorrect and that tree removal makes aerial monitoring of pipeline faster and cheaper. In 2017, several lawsuits have been filed in Contra Costa County Court by the non-profit organization Save Lafayette Trees stating that PG&E did not conduct the proper CEQA reviews or provide ample public notice before signing agreements for tree removal.\n\nOn the morning of April 16, 2013 a team of gunmen opened fire with rifles on the Metcalf Transmission Substation in San Jose, California, severely damaging 17 transformers.\n\nIn the middle of 2010, PG&E rolled out new electronic meters that replaced traditional mechanical electric meters. Customers whose meters were replaced with smart meters reported seeing their energy bills increase and accused the company of deliberately inflating their bills and questioned the accuracy of the meters. Subsequently, the California Public Utilities Commission conducted an investigation and found that of the 613 Smart Meter field tests, 611 meters were successfully tested and 100% passed Average Registration Accuracy. One meter was found to have serious errors and was malfunctioning on arrival, while another was found to have serious event errors upon installation. These meters were, therefore, excluded from testing.\n\nThere were also complaints that the company did not honor customers' request not to have their mechanical meters replaced. Although the contractor that installed the meters would honor these requests, PG&E would eventually replace them anyway.\n\nIn 2010, PG&E was accused of attempting to stifle competition with Proposition 16, which mandated approval from two-thirds of voters to start or expand a local utility. Critics argued that this would make it harder for local governments to create their own power utilities, thus effectively giving PG&E a monopoly. The company was also rebuked for supplying $46 million to support the ballot measure when opponents raised $100,000 in the campaign. The proposition was voted down with 52.5% in opposition and 47.5% in favor.\n\nIn December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized PG&E for spending $79 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $1 billion in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $4.8 billion and increasing executive pay by 94% to $8.5 million in 2010 for its top 5 executives.\n\nOn February 28, 2002, after the collapse of Enron, which used dubious accounting and partnerships to hide its debt, PG&E announced to restate results dating back to 1999, to show leases related to power plant construction that had been previously kept off its balance sheet.\n\nOn June 27, 2003, PG&E National Energy Group, a unit of PG&E Corporation revised its 2002 Form 10-K/A to reclassify certain offsetting revenues and expenses, which net to zero. PG&E revised its 2002 Form 10-K/A accordingly to reflect the change.\n\nThe PG&E and other investor owned utilities that are essentially granted monopoly status in California are guaranteed a negotiated fair rate of return on equity (ROE). PG&E's ROE rate was set at 10.4% and a return on rate base (ROR) was set at 8.06% by the CPUC in December 2012. PG&E electricity rates are among the highest in the United States. In his 2013 paper Jonathan Cook of the UC Davis Energy Efficiency Center, described the 'unique factors' that explain why PG&E's rates are higher than other utilities in California. According to Cook, PG&E procures 60% of its electricity supply from 3rd party generators and 40% from nuclear, fossil fuel and hydroelectric power plants. Many of the dams that produce PG&E's hydroelectric power were built in the early 1900s and require high maintenance. The cost of hydroelectric power maintenance is estimated to rise from $28 million in 2012 to $48 million. PG&E \"current and near-term capital expenditures are dominated by Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric system.\" Operations and Maintenance (O&M) expenses are expected to rise especially with new regulations in place after the Fukushima accident. PG&E uses less natural gas than its competitors and is expected \"to experience slower price growth rates\" particularly if there are high emission allowance prices.\n\nPG&E are also engaged a Clean Air Transportation Program, a A Dialogue on the Next Century of Energy, a We Can Do This.\n\nIn 2009 the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) unanimously approved a resolution that would allow the South San Joaquin Irrigation District to purchase PG&E’s electric facilities in Manteca, Ripon and Escalon. In March 2016 a \"San Joaquin County Superior Court Judge Carter Holly has rejected PG&E claims that South San Joaquin Irrigation District lacks sufficient revenues to provide electrical retail service to the cities of Manteca, Ripon, and Escalon and surrounding farms.\" The Municipal Service Review (MSR) found that SSJID's customer rates would be 15 percent lower than PG&E rates.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "231209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231209", "title": "Paper engineering", "text": "Paper engineering\n\nPaper engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the usage of physical science (e.g. chemistry and physics) and life sciences (e.g. biology and biochemistry) in conjunction with mathematics as applied to the converting of raw materials into useful paper products and co-products. The field applies various principles in process engineering and unit operations to the manufacture of paper, chemicals, energy and related materials. The following timeline shows some of the key steps in the development of the science of chemical and bioprocess engineering:\n\nFrom a heritage perspective, the field encompasses the design and analysis of a wide variety of thermal, chemical and biochemical unit operations employed in the manufacture of pulp and paper, and addresses the preparation of its raw materials from trees or other natural resources via a pulping process, chemical and mechanical pretreatment of these recovered biopolymer (e.g. principally, although not solely, cellulose-based) fibers in a fluid suspension, the high-speed forming and initial dewatering of a non-woven web, the development of bulk sheet properties via control of energy and mass transfer operations, as well as post-treatment of the sheet with coating, calendering, and other chemical and mechanical processes.\n\nToday, the field of paper and chemical engineering is applied to the manufacture of a wide variety of products. The (bio)chemical industry scope manufactures organic and agrochemicals (fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides), oleochemicals, fragrances and flavors, food, feed, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, chemicals, polymers and power from biological materials.\n\nThe resulting products of paper engineering including paper, cardboard, and various paper derivatives are widely used in everyday life. In addition to being a subset of chemical engineering, the field of paper engineering is closely linked to forest management, product recycling, and the mass production of paper – based media.\n\nIn the process of mechanical pulping, \"grinding\" and \"refining\" are the two main methods used to create the pulp. Grinding is the method of pressing logs and chips against a turning stone to produce fibers. Refiner pulping is treating wood chips with chemicals or heat and then crushing the objects between two disks, one or both of which are rotating. There are four main types of refiner pulping, which includes refiner mechanical pulping, thermo-mechanical pulping, chemi-mechanical pulping, and chemithermomechanical pulping. Further descriptions of each process are contained in this link:\nMechanical pulping, when compared to chemical pulping, is relatively inexpensive and has a high pulp yield (85–95%). However, the paper created is generally weak since it retains the lignin.\n\nThe process of chemical pulping is used to chemically disband the lignin found in the cell walls of the material undergoing the process. After the cellulose fibers are separated from the lignin, a pulp is created which can then be treated to create durable paper, boxes, and corrugated cardboard. Chemical pulping can be characterized by two main methods: sulfate (Kraft process) pulping and sulfite pulping, and these two methods have different benefits. Sulfate pulping can be performed on a wide range of tree varieties and results in the creation of a strong type of paper. Conversely, sulfite pulping results in a higher volume of pulp which is easier to bleach and process. However, sulfate pulping is more widely used since the product is more durable and the chemicals used in the process can be recovered, thus resulting in minimal environmental pollution.\n\nThe pulp is then processed through an apparatus which renders the pulp as a mesh of fibers. This fiber network is then pressed to remove all water contents, and the paper is subsequently dried to remove all traces of moisture.\n\nAfter the above processes have been completed, the resulting paper is coated with a minuscule amount of china clay or calcium carbonate to modify the surface, and the paper is then re-sized depending on its intended purpose.\n\nGenerally, the material to be recycled first undergoes mechanical or chemical pulping to render it in pulp form. The resulting pulp is then processed in the same way normal pulp is processed; however, original fiber is sometimes added to enhance the quality and appearance of the product.\n\nToday, the field of paper and bioprocess engineering is a diverse one, covering areas from biotechnology and nanotechnology to electricity generation.\n\nGenerally offered as a specialization within chemical engineering:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He represented New Jersey's fifth congressional district in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican from 1953 to 1975.\n\nPeter Frelinghuysen came from a long line of New Jersey politicians dating back to the early years of the United States, including four United States senators and two House members. He was the grandson of George Griswold Frelinghuysen, great-grandson of Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, the great-great-nephew of Theodore Frelinghuysen, and the great-great-great-grandson of Frederick Frelinghuysen. He was also a great-great-grandson of Ballantine Brewery founder Peter Ballantine.\n\nBorn on January 17, 1916, in New York City to Peter H.B. Frelinghuysen Sr. and the former Adaline Havemeyer, Frelinghuysen's father was a banker who descended from 18th century Dutch settlers in Somerset County. His siblings included his twin brother Henry O.H. Frelinghuysen, a philanthropist and civic leader, George G. Frelinghuysen, and Frederica Frelinghuysen Emert. He attended St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts, and graduated from Princeton University in 1938 and Yale Law School in 1941.\n\nAfter practicing law in New York City, he served in the Office of Naval Intelligence from September 1942 to December 1945 obtaining the rank of lieutenant. He then studied at Columbia University, 1946–1947. He served as staff of the Foreign Affairs Task Force of the Hoover Commission in 1948 before returning to the private sector. He served as director of Howard Savings Bank in Livingston, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1952, he was elected to the House of Representatives from New Jersey's 5th congressional district and served there until his retirement from politics in 1975. As a moderate Republican, he supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but not the Johnson administration's war on poverty programs.\nIn December 1959, when the Port of New York Authority's plans to develop a tract of woodlands and marsh near his estate in Morris County as an international airport serving the New York City region were exposed, Frelinghuysen participated in the opposition by the Jersey Jetport Site Association that was composed of local residents and conservationists, which raised funds to purchase almost 3,000 acres of the targeted site and donated it to the federal government, to be preserved forever as park lands. With the defeat of the airport development initiative, that parcel became the initial portion of the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, established by federal statute on November 3, 1960, in the middle of the development controversy.\n\nIn the 1960s, extortionists targeted Frelinghuysen for blackmail, arranging for him to have a sexual encounter with an underage male and then, posing as police officers, threatening him with public exposure. Frelinghuysen paid them $50,000. He later cooperated with the FBI's investigation of the extortionist ring, but the Justice Department notified the leadership of the House of Representatives and Frelinghuysen was forced off the Armed Services Committee.\n\nIn January 1965, he was House Minority Leader Gerald Ford's choice for Minority Whip, but lost on a secret ballot of the Republican caucus by a vote of 70 to 59 to the incumbent Les Arends, who had held the post since 1943.\n\nAfter leaving Congress, Frelinghuysen served on the boards of several nonprofit institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Botanical Garden.\n\nHe married the former Beatrice Sterling Procter, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, on September 7, 1940. She was a descendent of the founder of Procter & Gamble. Their children include Peter Frelinghuysen II, a lawyer, and Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a congressman.\n\nHis wife died in 1996. He died on May 23, 2011, at his home in Harding Township, New Jersey.\n\n"}

Seif was elected to the Parliament of Syria in 1994 as an independent and again in 1998. For several years he owned an Adidas franchise in Damascus.\n\nAccording to Seif, his career in business started with \"a workshop for manufacturing shirts in 1963.\" In 1993, he began \"building the New Adidas Company in 1993 ... the first of its kind in Syria\", after acquiring a franchise for Syria from the Adidas Corporation.\n\nFollowing the death of Syrian leader Hafez al Assad in June 2000, Seif assembled \"leading [Syrian] intellectuals and independent voices\" to discuss \"how to open up Syria's ... political system.\" The group - which met every Wednesday evening, in Seif's living room and was later dubbed the Forum for National Dialogue - \"debated human rights, pluralism, press and academic freedoms, and how to build a civil society,\" and was the first of several forums that \"marked the onset\" of the Damascus Spring. In January 2001, Seif announced his intention to create a new political party to compete with the ruling Ba'th Party. Around this time he also questioned the monopoly on the new cellular telephone system granted to the family of Hafez al Assad's wife Anisa Makhlouf. Calling the deal \"a big scandal that would cost Syria, an underdeveloped country, millions and millions of dollars\", Seif \"spoke against it loudly in parliament and forced them to investigate it.\" After a major meeting of the Forum for National Dialogue on 5 September 2001 which several hundred people attended, Seif was arrested. Charged with \"defying the state and trying to change the constitution by illegal means,\" he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison and released in January 2006. Since then Seif has told journalists that he and his family have been threatened by Syrian \"Mukhabarat\" demanding that he not talk to diplomats or any other foreigners, and that his businesses have been forced into bankruptcy; according to Seif, \"It started when they cut off supplies for my factories\".\n\nAmnesty International reports that since his release from prison he \"has been subjected to various forms of harassment and ill-treatment,\" including the refusal to allow him to leave the country in late August 2007 for treatment of his prostate cancer, \"which has advanced to a stage where it is liable to start spreading to other parts of his body without specialist treatment, which is only available outside Syria.\"\n\nHe was again arrested in early 2008 and imprisoned for trying to \"overthrow the government\", in reference to his work as a leader in the Damascus Declaration. He was then incarcerated in Adra Prison together with other leaders of the Damascus Declarations.\n\nHe was arrested on 6 May 2011 in Damascus. On 11 November 2012, he was elected co-vice-president of the new opposition government. On 6 May 2017, he was elected president of the new opposition government.\n\n\n"}

He is chairman of the Clermont Group, a Singapore-based business group that invests in public and private companies across a range of industries, including energy, financial services, consumer, and healthcare. Chandler \"has a reputation for buying struggling companies and successfully rebuilding them,\" according to Australian Broadcasting Corporation News. He also has been known to \"take a business approach to philanthropy.\"\n\nBorn in New Zealand, Chandler is the son of beekeepers Robert and Marija Chandler, who launched and operated Chandler House, a department store in Hamilton, New Zealand. \n\nChandler was formerly CEO of the Sovereign group of companies, in partnership with his brother, Christopher Chandler. Between 1986 and 2006, Sovereign invested in companies and governments in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and in industries including telecommunications, electric utilities, steel, oil and gas, banking and oil refining.\n\nThe brothers split their assets in 2007 with Richard Chandler creating Orient Global and Christopher Chandler starting Legatum Capital. Richard's investment style has been described as deep value investing, primarily in global emerging markets and especially in distress situations.\n\nOrient Global changed its name to Richard Chandler Corporation in April 2010 before becoming the Chandler Corporation in 2013, and the Clermont Group in 2016. The company \"is a long-term value investor that believes well-governed companies play a fundamental role in creating national prosperity,\" according to its website.\n\nRichard Chandler's business ventures have been tinged with themes of contrarian investment, corporate governance and social responsibility, especially by investing in and managing companies with national socio-economic implications. He once told Institutional Investor, \"We do have altruistic motives that some investors who are looking for a path of least resistance find hard to understand, but we don’t want to be defined by our corporate governance battles. We are value investors with a sense of responsibility, not activists.\"\n\nThe Chandler brothers were involved in a highly publicized incident in 2005. Sovereign sold its investment in South Korea's SK Corp., at the time South Korea's third-largest oil conglomerate, after the board refused to oust chairman and CEO Chey Tae Won. Chey had been convicted of accounting fraud for illegally trading stocks. Sovereign had invested in the company just after Chey's arrest, hoping to turn it around. Richard Chandler and his brother tried twice unsuccessfully to remove Chey and ultimately pulled out for ethical reasons. By that point they had improved the company and profited US$728 million.\n\nIn 2007 Richard Chandler launched a US$100 million education initiative in the developing world with the focus to build low-cost private education opportunities in India.

It had six stories, 5,000 square feet of space, stores on the ground floor, and commercial lofts in the rest. The structure was not squared, having elevation widths of 104.4 (frontage), 42.4, 108.9, and 52 feet.\n\nWestern Union sold it in 1888. The building was the focus of a complex tort in the 1890s over property value loss due to the operation of the Manhattan Elevated Railroad in front of it. The builder (Western Union) and the defendant (railway) were both controlled by the same group of investors, who were asserted to be in collusion against buyer Augustus D. Shepard to nullify any damages collected. Mutual Life Assurance foreclosed on the building in 1914, and auctioned it to Alliance Realty, who sold it in 1919 to Frazar & Co, about whom it was speculated that they would replace it with a new skyscraper.\n\nThe old building was torn down in 1926 to make way for a 24 story skyscraper of 125,000 square feet. It was completed in 1927. One of the earliest tenants of the new building was a company managing miniature golf courses and a golf school.\n\nNot long after its completion, the Irving Trust Company began started construction on a new building at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, visible from the Trinity Court Building. The builder commissioned a time study of the construction process.

{"id": "23480361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23480361", "title": "Unpaid work", "text": "Unpaid work\n\nUnpaid labor is defined as labor that does not receive any direct remuneration. This is a form of 'non-market work' which can fall into one of two categories: (1) unpaid work that is placed within the production boundary of the System of National Accounts (SNA), such as gross domestic product (GDP), and (2) unpaid work that falls outside of the production boundary (non-SNA work), such as domestic labor that occurs inside households for their consumption. Unpaid labor is visible in many forms and isn't limited to activities within a household. Other types of unpaid labor activities include volunteering as a form of charity work and interning as a form of unpaid employment.\n\nAccording to time-use surveys collected by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), women are the main undertakers of unpaid labor globally. This uneven division of unpaid labor within households has implications for women's involvement in both public and private spheres. One common form of unpaid work is unpaid domestic work. The burden of this type of unpaid work generally falls on the women in a household. Contributing so much time to unpaid domestic work has major effects on women and their participation in the labor market, which consequently affects children, society, and the state.\n\n\"Unpaid care work\" typically specifically contains everyday activities, such as cooking, washing, cleaning, shopping for own household, as well as care of children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled. The term \"unpaid care work\" is primarily defined as care work for family members, but it is important to note that other types of unpaid SNA work exist that address 'productive activities', which include types of labor such as \"growing food for own consumption, and collecting water and fuel\".\n\nWhile unpaid care work is not completely biological, reproductive labor (partially) is. Debra Satz believes that reproductive labor is \"a special kind of labor that should not be treated according to market norms\"; it includes childbearing and raising/taking care of children and other family members. Childbearing is an act that only those who possess female reproductive organs can perform, making it irreversibly a biological-female's job. Married women, single mothers, or other female family members (such as elder siblings, aunts, etc.) are expected to be the primary actors of this unpaid reproductive labor in their personal lives, on top of the economic necessity of entering the productive, paid labor force. Child-rearing falls under both reproductive and care labor, so, after breastfeeding, any member of the household can take on the job.\n\nThe role of women and men within their households is deeply rooted in gender norms and cultural values that have been reinforced over time by colonization and imperialism. For example, as seen in Patricia Grimshaw's research in Hawaii: New England missionaries assumed the roles of imperialists and colonialists by preaching their Christian values to the native Hawaiian population, who, before the missionary women arrived, practiced polygamy (high class-status allowing) and did not trouble themselves with domestic tasks like ironing. The Christian women, in particular, saw it as their responsibility to teach the native women notions of femininity that consisted of remaining inside the home to care for the family and to remain submissive to their husbands. Historically, a woman's position in the home was seen as a prerequisite to being a \"good\" wife and mother. Since the 1960s, however, the spread of globalization has given rise to new opportunities for women to participate in market work that has challenged the assumption their primary adult role as that of caretaker for the family and home.\n\nThe spread of globalization has created more opportunities for women to enter paid employment, but has not relieved them of their time spent on unpaid labor. While participating in the labor market, women who secure paid employment undertake what is known as the \"double burden\" of labor. Finding the optimal balance of balance of paid and unpaid labor, or work life balance, is a constant struggle for women trying to create careers for themselves while raising children or caring for elderly family members. Women have to constantly decide where to allocate time and financial resources, which impacts their ability to develop their own capabilities. In turn, this decision impacts their family's relative standard of living as measured by national income accounting statistics.\n\nBecause of social norms and expectations, the burden of unpaid work primarily falls on the female member(s) of the household. Even if the male member(s) of the household are available to perform the care labor after they return home from their paid job, it is more often seen that the women are taking on the bulk of the care labor after they return home.\n\nThe traditional view of a family involves a woman in unpaid domestic labor supporting the household; however, under trends of dual earner couples and a gradually aging population, the commercialization of housework and domestic care has become inevitable. Arguments have been made that the value of unpaid domestic labor must always be considered to prevent the exploitation of unpaid workers, and thus should be seen as legitimate employment. There are also arguments that a \"caregiver allowance\" should be provided to unpaid domestic workers to protect the labor value of their work.\n\nRegardless of the methodology used, a variety of studies have shown that the division of household labor results in a disproportionate burden falling on the wives in married couples' households. While this is the case, it has also been shown that the disparity between men and women in married households has been shrinking to some degree. For example, during the Great Recession of the 2000s, low income men increased their contributions to their households by completing more hours of unpaid domestic work.\n\nGlobally, the expectation of women being the main providers of 'unpaid care' labor has been socially constructed and enforced by gender norms. Even when women are employed full-time outside the house, they may perform a greater share of household chores and childcare activities. As a result of globalization, women have increasingly been expected to take on jobs in both the paid and unpaid sectors, contributing to family income while still being the main providers of unpaid labor. This inequality emphasizes the gender division of labor and how it has changed with globalization's shifts in employment patterns. Furthermore, it illuminates how socially constructed gender norms have created a system that encourages women to continue to carry the 'double burden' of care services. The 'double burden' structure has contributed tremendously to the economic vulnerability of women, as women in financial crises are more likely to be poor, unemployed, ill in health, and uneducated. Women often suffer more during financial crises because they tend to be more generally disadvantaged than men.\n\nA double burden, otherwise known as a double day, is the phenomenon that a woman holds a paying job in the labor market and then must come home and work a full day's worth of unpaid domestic work within the home. Due to societal norms and expectations, the burden of unpaid work primarily falls on the female in the household even if she and her husband work the same hours in the labor market.\n\nBalancing paid and unpaid work obligations is taxing on women. Reports of increased stress levels are not uncommon. In fact, women report higher levels of symptoms related to depression and anxiety, including low life satisfaction and subjective well-being. As women increase their paid work time, they do not achieve a corresponding reduction in their unpaid work hours. Nor have men increased their share of unpaid work at the same rate that women have increased their share of paid work. The Human Development Report of 2015 reports that, in 63 countries, 31 percent of women's time is spent doing unpaid work, as compared to men who dedicate only 10 percent of their time to unpaid work. The double-burden is intensified when women are subjected to poverty and live in communities that lack basic infrastructure. In areas that lack easy access to food and water, household duties are even more time consuming.\n\nThe most commonly used method for measuring unpaid domestic labor is through the collection of time-use surveys. These surveys attempt to evaluate how much time is spent providing different services, such as time spent in the workforce versus time spent on unpaid domestic work, such as cooking. Sarah Gammage conducted time use surveys in Guatemala to measure time spent doing unpaid domestic work within households and between family members. In this study, Gammage found women completed approximately 70% of all unpaid domestic work within a household. Similarly, Debbie Budlenger conducted time use surveys across six different countries and found women in each country conducted the majority of the unpaid domestic work each day. The results of her findings are summarized in the chart below: \n\nIn a different time use survey, Liangshu Qi and Xiao-yuan Dong found that, in China men complete an average of 58 minutes of unpaid work a day compared to the 139 minutes of unpaid work a day that women complete.\n\nTime-series data collected by the United Nations Statistics Division from 2000 to 2015 directly support the claim that women undertake more than half of household domestic labor all over the world. The largest discrepancy between female and male time-use is in developing countries. The data was collected through a 24-hour diary and then averaged over seven days across 80 countries. In the top ten are three Scandinavian countries (in order from lowest discrepancy in time-use to highest): Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands and Finland. Out of all the countries included in the data set, Sweden had the smallest discrepancy between female and male time use with a difference of 3.33 hours out of a full day.\n\nIn comparison, Algeria, Tunisia, Mexico, Iraq and Guatemala each had female-to-male time-use discrepancies that exceeded 18+ hours of work per day. For both Mexico and Guatemala, the proportion of domestic work that women do exceeded the number of hours in a day by about three hours. Women possibly had some days when they performed more housework than usual, which may have skewed the average. Mathematically, the average of spending four hours per day seven days a week on domestic household labor equates to 672 hours per week or 28 hours per day as an approximation.\n\nExamining only male participation in domestic household labor, the latest data available for Malawi shows that the amount of housework that men do per day is approximately 1.25 hours, and that is the same length of time that Cambodian men spent on household labor in 2004. Other nations with poor male participation in the division of household labor include Pakistan (males:1.81; 18.06 hours discrepancy), Mali (males: 2.50; 17.92 hours discrepancy), Japan (males: 2.92; 12.01 discrepancy) and Palestine (males: 3.06; 16.11 hours discrepancy).\n\nOn the other hand, the minimum number of hours that women spend on average occupied by domestic tasks 8.68 hours per week in Malawi. In the United States, the latest available data from 2014 shows that women undertake 14.58 hours per week on household labor. The trend in the division of household domestic labor in countries that have more than one year's worth of data show that, for 14 out of the 35 countries and between a range of 0.99 to 12.99 hours, women's proportion of unpaid labor on average diminished.\n\nSocially constructed gender roles are prescribed as ideal or proper behaviors for specific categories of male and female. Societies have socially constructed women's roles because women are primarily financially dependent on men as is defined through a 'sexual contract', thus deeming them a \"private responsibility of individual men\". This construction has resulted in women being domesticated because their primary access to economic support was through marriage to a man. This gender division has made women's needs and rights invisible, which allows men to \"continue to dominate women and define them as dependent\" and conceals the needed dependency between men and women. This ignored 'dual dependency' highlights the fact that men are dependent on women's \"domestic and reproductive labor\" just as women are dependent on the income of men.\n\nIn many societies the socially constructed role of women includes \"giving birth, caring for children, the elderly, and disabled, preparing food and clothing and collecting water, and firework, among others\". Furthermore, women's gender roles are socially constructed within the economy as well, because their economic contributions can be easily replaced for men through remarriage or by paying for care services; care work can be bought and sold, but the vast majority of care work is unpaid and is not formally accounted for. The socially constructed gender roles of men being the breadwinners who women depend on and women as members of the domestic sphere have thus been reinforced through economic motives that pose gender relations between men and women as an exchange of support for service. This configuration is based on 'patriarchal control', which is proclaimed to be linked to the \"socialization processes where women are raised to be relational\" care takers and family structure supports, while men are more 'individualistic' since their role is only tied to providing money. In other words, men provide the money and women are to provide 'unpaid labor'. Consequently, in the field of \"unpaid care work\" men typically take on far less responsibility than women due to the socially constructed 'gender division of labor' which assigns the obligation of 'caring labor' to women.\n\nThe disproportionate division of household unpaid labor that falls on women negatively impacts their ability to navigate life outside their homes. Their undertaking of unpaid labor is a barrier to entry into the paid employment sector or in the case of those women who enter paid labor they still are left with a \"double-burden\" of labor.\n\nThe UNDP Women and Development Report of 1995 conducted a time-use study that analyzed the amount of time women and men spend on paid and unpaid household and community work in thirty-one countries across the world, including countries classified as 'industrial, 'developing' and 'transition economies.' They found that in almost every country studied women worked longer hours than men but received fewer economic rewards. The study found that in both the 'developing' and 'industrialized world', men received the \"lion's share of income and recognition\" for their economic inputs, while women's work remained \"unpaid, unrecognized, and undervalued.\" Moreover, in the case of paid and unpaid work hours, the study concluded that within 'industrial countries' women spent \"two-thirds\" of their total work burden on unpaid activities and \"one-third on paid activities\" (shares were reversed for men), while in 'developing' countries women spent \"two-thirds\" of their total work on unpaid labor but \"less than one-quarter of the men's\" total work was spent on unpaid labor. Additionally, scholar Ruth Pearson argues that women in developing countries tend to shoulder a majority of the unpaid work due to the fact that men refuse to undertake \"women's work\" because \"women as a gender have obligations of others that men as a gender do not bear.\" The uneven distribution of unpaid care labor amongst the sexes is thus demonstrated globally, although particularly in developing countries such as Nigeria and Ecuador, where women redistribute increased unpaid care labor to females from extended family instead of procuring male participation.\n\nTime use surveys show that women spend far more time doing unpaid work than men. With women spending more time providing unpaid domestic work than men, women are also spending less time in the workforce and, therefore, bringing in lower incomes to the household. Because women are traditionally believed to bring in less income than men, women are discouraged from investing in education and skills. This further entrenches women into domestic unpaid work, creating a cycle of social norms that is difficult to break and exacerbates gender inequality.\n\nThis form of gender inequality feeds into the dynamic of 'gender risks', which explains why it is women and girls that are most disadvantaged, as well as why it is more likely for increased poverty to affect women more than men.\n\nEven if women do enter the workforce, they are usually still held accountable for the majority of the domestic unpaid work at home. This phenomenon of having to work a full day in the workforce and then come home and complete a full day of unpaid domestic work is known as the double burden. The double burden negatively affects women because it gives them less time to spend in the workforce, resulting in men dedicating more time to the workforce, and, therefore, likely getting promoted over women. The double burden also negatively affects women's personal wellbeing because it means women have less time for taking care of themselves and sleeping. This can also negatively affect their job performance in the workforce, encouraging male promotion over female.\n\nStatistics show that many children, particularly in poorer countries and households, are forced to contribute to the unpaid domestic work of a household. Because unpaid domestic work is traditionally the role of women in many societies, the burden of unpaid domestic work falls particularly on young girls who are forced to drop out of school to assist with the unpaid work within their households.\n\nSome economists argue that unpaid domestic work should be included as economic contributions. The economic value of women's unpaid labor is not included in gross domestic product (GDP) or national income accounting indicators. For this reason, the invisibility of women's work makes analyzing the relationship between households and labor markets difficult. In addition, measures of economic output are largely inaccurate. if unpaid work were incorporated when measuring GDP, it would have raised the GDP by 26 percent in 2010.\n\nUnpaid work contributes to the economy by producing important goods and services such as meals and cleanliness of the home. This allows other household members, as well as the women who deal with the double burden (considering the fact that they need care labor to survive, too), to enter the workforce and contribute to the overall economy via paying jobs. For this reason, Indira Hirway argues that unpaid domestic work should be considered economic production rather than consumption. Hirway also notes that unpaid domestic work has the attributes of a standard economic good because it is neither free nor unlimited.\n\nUnpaid work also affects the labor supply of the economy because fewer women are entering into the workforce due to their domestic unpaid work duties.\n\nUnpaid domestic work has a positive effect on a state's budget. Unpaid domestic work is typically the type of work that a state would provide for its citizens if family members were not already providing for their family. This includes things like child care, elder care, medical care, and nutrition. Because these things are being provided by an unpaid domestic worker, the state does not need to expend resources to provide its citizens with these services. Therefore, unpaid domestic work can decrease the amount of money a state must spend to otherwise provide these services. Note, however, that when a state cuts care services for the young, elderly, sick and disabled, the burden of this care is generally placed on female family members, meaning decreases in a state's spending on care can have a negative effect on female participation in the workforce.\n\nAs noted by Aslanbeigui and Summerfield, when cuts to social expenditures are experienced women and children suffer the most, particularly during financial crises. They argue that cuts to healthcare, education and income disadvantage women in the long-term and push them further into poverty and therefore more reliant on the state.\n\nUnpaid care labor is necessary to maintain order in our global market economy. According to Henderson's Cake Model (known by most as Cake Theory), reproductive labor and care labor are \"key to the functioning of all economies.\"\n\nCare labor maintains the well-being, and thereby fosters the productivity, of those who are performing paid work. Productivity—along with its ability to be used for personal gain by individuals within the system—is used to produce capital. There are two types of capital: financial capital, which maintains the world's Capitalist practices by placing monetary value on everything that can be deemed \"valuable,\" and human capital, which is \"the skills, knowledge, and experience possessed by an individual or population, viewed in terms of their value or cost to an organization or country;\" economists consider \"expenditures on education, training, medical care, and so on as investments in human capital\" because they foster health and well-being in those who work towards producing financial capital. Human capital, however, is typically valued less than financial capital because the labor done to contribute to human capital is heavily feminized.\n\nSince it has become increasingly necessary for more than one individual in a household to join the paid labor force, care labor (especially cooking, cleaning, and child-rearing in the forms of chefs, maids/cleaning staffs, and day-care workers) has become marketized. \"Workers in [care] sectors are often among the most exploited, receiving low pay and working under precarious conditions.\"\n\nThere are three different ways to measure the value of unpaid domestic work: the opportunity cost method, the replacement cost method, and the input/out cost method.\n\nThe opportunity cost method measures the value of unpaid domestic work by calculating the amount of money unpaid domestic workers could be making if instead of doing unpaid work they were working in the labor market. For example, if a former female attorney is now a stay-at-home mother conducting unpaid domestic work, the value of an hour of unpaid domestic work is the hourly rate she could make if she were working as an attorney. The major flaw with this method is that two unpaid domestic workers can do the same job at the same proficiency level, but the value of the work will fluctuate based on the workers' prior education and skill level. It is also a problem for women who never held a job, because it is unclear how much money they would be making if they were participating in the work force, rather than working unpaid at home.\n\nThe replacement cost method measures the value of unpaid domestic work by calculating the monetary cost of purchasing that service instead. For example, to value unpaid child care, look at the cost of hiring a nanny, or to value the cost of cooking a meal, look at the cost of eating a similar meal at a restaurant. The flaw with this method is that it cannot account for the added sentimental value of having a mother stay at home with her children rather than a stranger.\n\nThe input/output cost method measures the value of unpaid domestic work by calculating the monetary value of the economic goods and services produced by unpaid domestic work and how much these goods and services would sell for in the open market.\n\nDynamic policy solutions that emphasize the value of unpaid labor contributions at the macro level and redistribute unpaid labor within households are essential for gender equality. The following section outlines potential policy solutions that have been put forth by other academics.\n\nRequiring data collection at the national and state level The quality and availability of data at the micro and macro levels is an area in need of improvement for the purpose of studying how policies impact the division of labor within households and for calculating the value unpaid labor. Organizations, such as the United Nations Statistics Division, capture quantitative data on the number of hours women and men spend on paid, unpaid and total work hours. Collecting more qualitative data would be additionally useful for determining how to calculate the value unpaid labor, particularly for the market replacement cost method.\n\nInvestment into public infrastructure Policies aimed at channeling public funds towards investment projects that create more efficient accessibility to resources are essential for lessening the burden of unpaid labor, particularly in developing countries. As noted by Koolwal and van de Walle (2013), women in rural and developing countries spend a considerable amount of time collecting water. In their study which look at countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia they found that when access to water increased as a result of infrastructure investment women didn't enter into more paid employment, but their overall time spent on unpaid labor did diminish.\n\nSubsidized child, elder and care services The state's role in providing quality affordable care services should not be overlooked. Since free childcare would be ineffective at generating income for workers, the services need to be subsidized to ensure that workers are compensated for their labor and that families can afford to use their services\n\nSubsidized energy (non-reliant on fossil fuels) To reduce the amount of time spent collecting fuel for household energy demands, central governments and states should sponsor renewable energy sources for the purpose of reducing the amount of time women spend of fetching fuelwood. In addition, an alternative is investing in biogas production which is a better alternative to standard forms of household fuel given that it is pollution-free[30] leading to a reduction in indoor air pollution that will benefit all members of a household.\n\nFamily-friendly workplace policies Shortened work weeks, flexible paid leave and the ability to work from home are possible solutions that would facilitate the redistribution of unpaid labor within households. In Nancy Fraser's article, \"After the Family Wage: Gender Equity and the Welfare State\" from 1994, she suggests that in two partner households a reduced work week is the most efficient vehicle for assuring gender equality. At the same time, it's essential that policy makers are aware of household dynamics that aren't limited to dual income earning households to ensure that single parents aren't left more vulnerable economically.\n\n"}

The company was founded on 4 December 1987 as Cancom Ventures Inc, owning an Edmonton secretarial college and an industrial equipment rental business. On 30 August 1989 the name was changed to Multi-Corp Inc. In 1993, board member Michael Lobsinger took control of the company, became CEO, and turned the company towards the telecommunications industry, purchasing several privately held companies involved in the telecommunications businesses, and in November 1993, Multi-Corp entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Eric Chappell for a stroke-based Chinese text entry system which they referred to as the \"Jiejing Licenses\". A wholly owned subsidiary, Ziran Developments Inc, was formed to handle the Chinese text entry business. \nThe company was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange on 9 June 1995 (symbol MCU). Under Lobsinger, the strategic importance of the Chinese text entry grew, and Ziran was renamed Zi Corporation in 1996; \"Zi\" meaning \"character\" in Chinese. \nThe telecommunications businesses were disposed of by 1997 In June 1997, the parent company was renamed Zi Corporation to reflect the importance of the new business. In 1999, co-founder Gary Kovacs joined as COO.\n\nHaving started with Chinese on personal computers, toward the end of the 1990s Zi's focus moved to text entry for all languages for mobile phones and other handheld devices, where efficient entry of text traditionally has been challenging due to limitations of a physically small device. This new business area was quickly quite successful, especially in the Chinese market, and in 1998 Zi entered into licensing agreements with Ericsson (later Sony Ericsson), who at that time was a very significant player in the Chinese market. Further license agreements with Ericsson and other companies were to follow, for a total of more than 1000 different device models being shipped with Zi text entry software,\nin more than 100 million devices.\n\nThe introduction of touch screen technology for mobile devices made the company follow up with software for handwriting recognition, with focus on languages such as Chinese and Japanese.\nIn 2003, Mike Donnell took over as CEO from Lobsinger.\nZi Corporation was listed on NASDAQ from September 2007 .\n\nText entry on devices with limited number of keys was early subject to a number of software patents, and Zi was engaged in several costly patent disputes with Tegic Corporation, later Nuance Communications.\nIn August 2008, Nuance made a takeover bid to acquire the company for million, which the company declined. Shortly thereafter, Nuance filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Zi. The company was finally acquired by Nuance for million on 26 February 2009, and the acquisition was completed on 9 April 2009.\n\nZi's main product was \"EZiText\" predictive text entry software, in competition with solutions such as the original T9 product from Tegic, later Nuance.\nOther products include \"eZiType\", a predictive text entry product for mobile email users, for keyboard-based mobile devices, \"Qix\", a service discovery engine that provides a quick and easy method for accessing a phone's features, applications, and services, and \"Decuma\" which delivers an input method for pen-based devices by fusing handwriting recognition with predictive text technology.\n\nThere was a series of patent infringement lawsuits between Tegic, the holder of the T9 patents, and Zi:\n\n\n"}

He was assassinated during spring 2000. At the time of his death, Petrović was the CEO of Serbian flag carrier Jat Airways. The crime remains unsolved to this day.\n\nPetrović graduated from the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Transport in 1968. He became Jat's CEO in 1992.\n\nHe was a member of Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), political party headed at the time by Slobodan Milošević.\n\nOn Tuesday night, 25 April 2000, around 21:30 CET, Petrović was killed by unknown assassin(s) in front of his parents' home at 20 Jaša Prodanović Street in Belgrade. Petrović was reportedly parking his JAT-issued metallic gray Audi in front of the house when two assailants killed him from behind with four bullets to the head and back. B92 reporter on the scene counted five bullet shells, while \"Blic\" reported that more than ten bullets were fired at Petrović. The killers likely used a silencer as nobody in the area reported hearing any gun noise. According to neighbours, the police showed up very quickly after the murder and blocked off the street. Radomir Marković, the head of the State Security Service, came to the crime scene as well.\n\nThe case remains unsolved.\n\nDue to Petrović's position, longtime CEO of a large state-owned enterprise, as well as his political connections through SPS party, the murder sparked a lot of domestic and international reaction and press coverage.\n\nSerbian Ministry of the Interior put out a press release saying: \"This is undeniably a terrorist act committed against a high-ranking official of FR Yugoslavia's state-economy. The police is undertaking intense investigative measures to apprehend those that carried out this crime\". \n\nSerbian minister of justice Dragoljub Janković called Petrović's murder a \"foreign-imported state terrorism of the very specific kind\". He continued: \"This is a perfidious attempt at destabilizing the current authorities. One of many similar attempts at tearing down the state institutions that we're seeing around us these days, including the street protests, media interference, and now even executions of state officials. The idea on the part of those who order these acts is clearly to create suspicion, panic, and lack of confidence in the system and authority among the people. The implicit message is probably that some other individuals could come in and bring some order in this area. The fact that these events are thought up and imported from abroad is further making it difficult for our institutions. As is the fact that local unofficial institutions and certain media outlets are taking this side. What's left is the old adage - the justice is slow, but reachable\".\n\nOpposition figures also chimed in. Nebojša Čović, the president of Democratic Alternative (DA), said: \"Because of this murder, the minister of the interior Vlajko Stojiljković should immediately resign. It's absurd that in Serbia we've never had more policemen, and yet our citizens have never been less safe and secure\".\n\nMomčilo Perišić, the president of the Movement for Democratic Serbia (PDS), said that he \"knew Petrović personally, though not well enough to speculate on the motives behind his murder\", adding: \"If the police called this a terrorist act, it means that they're admitting there's terror in Serbia. And if there is terror in Serbia, they're not doing their job properly. I'm afraid our institutions aren't up to the task and that there are certain parallel institutions of sorts created for one-off purposes, such as media intimidation among other things. These parallel institutions have broken free and are now endangering those that created them in the first place\".\n\nWestern publications speculated about the reasons for Petrović's murder, especially in light of the fact that it came amidst a 2000 crime wave during which many prominent figures in the country got assassinated including mobsters Željko \"Arkan\" Ražnatović (15 January), Radoslav \"Bata Trlaja\" Trlajić (25 February), Branislav \"Dugi\" Lainović (20 March), Zoran \"Ćanda\" Davidović (23 March), and Zoran \"Skole\" Uskoković (27 April), politicians Pavle Bulatović (7 February 2000) and Ivan Stambolić (25 August 2000), even two unsuccessful attempts on the life of opposition politician Vuk Drašković.\n"}
