She is co-founder of the international transport company Stagecoach Group.\n\nEducated at Caledonian Road Primary School and Perth High School, she qualified as a nurse , and during a 20-year career worked as a burn unit sister. She is ranked as Scotland's richest woman.\n\nUsing her father's redundancy money, and working with her brother Sir Brian Souter and her first husband Robin Gloag, Gloag established the Stagecoach Group in 1980, running buses from Dundee to London. Expansion continued and in the early 1990s, Stagecoach acquired National Bus Company operations in Cumberland, Hampshire, East Midlands, Ribble, Southdown and the United Counties. Stagecoach bought further bus operations in Scotland, Newcastle and London, with Manchester being added in 1993.\n\nIn November 2013, Gloag took ownership of Kent International Airport, also known as Manston Airport for the sum of £1. Gloag's co-director is Pauline Bradley, a corporate lawyer and former head of joint ventures at Bank of Scotland, described by the Scottish Herald as \"one of Scotland's most powerful women\".\n\nDespite assurances to staff regarding long term investment in the airport, management announced a consultation on closure in April 2014.\n\nUncertainty about the airport's future led flight operators who were using Manston to leave, notably KLM who ran a twice daily service to Amsterdam Schiphol. A number of bids were forthcoming during the consultation period to buy and run the airport, but on 15 May 2014 Manston was closed with the loss of 144 jobs in the airport and an unknown number in the surrounding area. Gloag did not appear publicly or give a reason for the airport's closure or her refusal to sell. The trade union Unite said it would challenge the way the consultation on closure was conducted. Sir Roger Gale, Member of Parliament for Thanet North, described Gloag's actions as an act of \"corporate vandalism\".\n\n, Gale and pressure groups including \"Save Manston Airport\" and \"Why Not Manston?\" continue to campaign for the reopening of the airport and have opposed alternative uses. In May 2014, then prime minister David Cameron, in answer to a question from Gale in the Houses of Commons, stated that the future of Manston was the responsibility of the airport owner, but the Government was in negotiation with Mrs Gloag. In July 2017 planning inspectors rejected an appeal stating that the site was protected for aviation use under EC4 regulations.\n\nGloag has owned Beaufort Castle near Inverness since 1995, and Kinfauns Castle, near Perth since 2004. She has attempted to block off private access at Kinfauns in a high-profile case. On 12 June 2007 she was successful in gaining a court ruling that she was legally entitled to bar the public from a swath of woodland in the grounds of Kinfauns Castle.\n\nHer ex-husband, Robin Gloag, was killed in a car crash on 6 December 2007. Their son, Jonathan, killed himself in 1999, aged 28.\n\nA member of the Church of the Nazarene, she founded the Freedom From Fistula Foundation.

They operate under the mission to change the way medicine is designed, developed, tested and brought to market through computational medicine and AI technology. It is a fully integrated AI company with pharmaceutical discovery and clinical development capabilities.\n\nThe company has developed the Benevolent Platform™, which as of 2018 is the world’s only end-to-end computational and experimental platform for drug discovery; BenevolentAI scientists use the platform to find new ways to treat disease and personalise drugs to patients. The Benevolent Platform™ continuously ingests and analyses unstructured and structured biomedical information, from academic papers to compound databases, to clinical trials, to scientific patents. This information is combined with deep learning to create a bioscience knowledge graph coupled with an automated platform for hypothesis generation and validation followed by the design, refinement and synthesis of molecules.\n\nThe company is headquartered in King’s Cross, London with a research facility in Cambridge (UK) and additional offices based in New York and Belgium. On keeping the company headquartered in London, founder Mulvany has said “There's a real opportunity to build a business in this country, and there's an opportunity for the country to lead this sector, and all the pieces are in place. We've got incredible scientists, incredible mathematicians, we're able to draw all these people into London.\" BenevolentAI has active R&D drug programmes from discovery to PhaseIIb in disease areas such as ALS, Parkinson’s, Ulcerative Colitis and Sarcopenia. \n\nHorizons Ventures advisor Bart Swanson is a board member; shareholders include Richard Farleigh, a high profile angel investor.\n\nBenevolentAI was founded in November 2013 by Ken Mulvany. Initially the company focussed on the development of a cross functional AI technology to incorporate basic science, chemistry and clinical components and designed that could ingest, read and contextualise the world’s available bioscience information.\n\nThroughout the course of 2014 and 2015 the technology was further developed to also reason and propose hypotheses to treat disease. By 2015, the company had raised $87 million in funding, including investors like Woodford Investment Management and Lansdowne Partners. In 2015 BenevolentAI began to fully apply its technology to drug discovery and development and announced the appointment of Jackie Hunter to lead bioscience research at the company. \n\nDuring 2016 further early drug R&D programmes were established and an in-license deal completed with J&J for novel clinical stage drug candidates. That year BenevolentAI also initiated their first full drug programmes for ALS, and indicated in a later press release positive results from the initial data. \n\n2017 saw the company file its first Investigational New Drug (IND) application. In February 2018, BenevolentAI acquired a Cambridge research facility in order to expand its capabilities across the entire drug discovery process. Two months later the company announced a further round of funding for $115 million. In May of 2018, the company announced it had appointed Joanna Shields as CEO.\n\nIn 2016 BenevolentAI became the first European company to use a deep learning supercomputer to assist in the process of drug discovery, using the DGX-1 supercomputer to support its Judgment Augmented Correlation System (JACS). The BenevolentAI Platform™ ingests data, reads, synthesizes, and contextualises data to determine the cause of a disease, proposes a drug target, makes a molecule to treat that disease and then defines the right patients to test that molecule in to drive greater clinical success. \n\nTheir Platform™ is specifically used to design new molecules and extract hypotheses based on a knowledge graph detailing the relationships between genes, targets, diseases, proteins, and drugs. The company has announced it is working with the Sheffield Institute of Translational Neuroscience on a treatment for ALS.\n\nIn 2017 BenevolentAI announced the creation of the BenevolentAI Award, in partnership with the Association of Medical Research Charities. The award is given to a single applicant a year, allowing the winner to access the company’s technology to accelerate their medical research using artificial intelligence.\n\nThe winner of the 2018 award was a collaboration between the Parkinson’s UK and The Cure Parkinson’s Trust.

The company was founded in 2010 by former Israeli intelligence officers Dan Zorella (in Hebrew: דן זורלא) and Avi Yanus (in Hebrew: אבי ינוס). Its employees include former members of Israeli intelligence units, including Aman, Mossad and Shin Bet, as well as legal and financial experts. \n\nBlack Cube’s main business is \"litigation support\", in which the company provides intelligence, evidence and advisory services in multi-jurisdictional legal and criminal cases.\n\nBlack Cube's tactics have resulted in a number of international controversies. In Romania, two of its employees were convicted of criminal charges involving harassment and hacking.\n\nBeginning in 2011, Black Cube provided intelligence services to Vincent Tchenguiz in a number of cases, including Tchenguiz’s fight against the UK Serious Fraud Office, following his arrest as part of the SFO investigation into the collapse of the Icelandic bank Kaupthing. Black Cube analysed the network of relationships surrounding the collapse of the bank, and helped build a successful challenge to the SFO arrests and search warrants, causing the judge to declare the SFO’s actions unlawful in 2013. Following this investigation the SFO was ordered by the court to pay over £3m to Tchenguiz in 2014, and to issue a formal apology. \n\nIn 2014, Black Cube were hired by Israeli businessman Nochi Dankner, to examine a court decision assigning control of IDB Holding Corp. Ltd. (TASE:IDBH) to Motti Ben Moshe. Black Cube investigated the sources of capital of Ben Moshe, revealing an ongoing investigation by German regulatory authorities into Ben Moshe’s company ExtraEnergy, and locating a witness who held evidence of money laundering and tax evasion by Ben Moshe.\n\nBlack Cube was hired to assist Kfar Gildai Quarries in their highly publicised dispute with Caeserstone (NASDAQ:CSTE). Black Cube engaged a Caesarstone engineer in conversation during a group bicycle trip in Kfar Giladi. In the recording, the engineer contradicted the allegations that were made by Ceaserstone in the arbitration proceeding with Kfar Giladi. After six years of deliberations, Judge Boaz Okun ordered Caeserstone to pay more than $14m as compensation to Kfar Giladi. \n\nIn 2015, Black Cube assisted Taiwanese businessman Nobu Su, owner of the shipping company TMT, in his efforts to gain permission to appeal a 2014 judgement in favour of Lakatamia Shipping in which Su was found personally liable for the amount of almost $47m. Black Cube delivered intelligence to Su’s legal team showing that 20% of the judgement amount was due to a company called Slagen Shipping, which had ceased operations at the time of the establishment of the claim, thereby rendering it unable to act as a claimant, both reducing the quantum of the judgement significantly, and causing the appeal to be granted.\n\nIn 2016, Black Cube was involved in exposing bribery and corruption in a set of Italian arbitrations between AmTrust (NASDAQ:AFSI) and an Italian named Antonio Somma totalling €2bn. Somma admitted to the company's undercover agents that he could control the arbitration panels, and that he had an agreement to pay the chair of the arbitration panel 10% of any money they awarded him. Following Black Cube's findings, the arbitrator was dismissed and in July 2016, the two sides reached a settlement on the total of 60 million euros instead of the initial 2 billion euro claim.\n\nIn 2016, Black Cube was hired by Rami Levy, the owner of Rami Levy Chain Stores Hashikma Marketing (TASE:RMLI) who is considered a champion of low prices in Israel, to verify his suspicions that he was being targeted by a rival chain in a negative media campaign. Black Cube provided Levy with evidence that the PR agent who worked for Levy's competitor, Victory supermarket chain, exposed the negative campaign that they carried out aimed at damaging Levy's public reputation. Levy later used those materials in a lawsuit against his competitor.\n\nIn 2016, Alstom (EPA:ALO) and Afcon (TASE:AFHL) hired Black Cube’s services in order to assist them with their dispute against the Israel Railways’ electrification bid, which the Spanish company SEMI won. Black Cube presented recordings of officials from the Israel Railway discussing malfunctions that occurred in the bid. Based on these findings, in January 2018, the Superior Court in Israel issued an agreement of compromise according to which the work on the railway will be divided between all three of the companies and that Black Cube’s clients’ work will be priced at 580 million NIS, after they originally lost the bid.\n\nIn 2017, Gefen Biomed (TASE:GEFEN) filed a NIS 60 million lawsuit which claims that entrepreneurs Moshe (Mori) Arkin and others deliberately misled or deceived minority shareholders in biomed company cCam Biotherapeutics. The lawsuit is based on evidence collected by Black Cube, which conducted recorded interviews with key figures in cCam that prove a deliberate and systematic attempt to conceal exit talks with Merck (NYSE:MRK) for up to $625 million.\n\nSpecialising in Asset Tracing and analysis of offshore companies and trusts, Black Cube was hired by Bank Hapoalim (TASE: POLI) to trace the assets of Motti Zisser, who left behind a high debt to the bank. Black Cube provided intelligence of many assets in Europe which were transferred from Mr. Zisser to his son David through a sophisticated network of shell companies. Networks of hotels in Brussels, a hotel and mall district in Amsterdam, apartments in Strasbourg and a company in Hong Kong were located, among others. As a result of the intelligence gathered by Black Cube, Bank Hapoalim was granted an injunction that applies an effective freeze on all the companies of the Zisser Family. At the end of a legal process, the two parties came to a settlement in February 2018, according to which Zisser’s heirs would pay nearly 95 million NIS to Bank Hapoalim.\n\nIn 2013, Black Cube filed a lawsuit in the UK against Vincent Tchenguiz for unpaid invoices and breach of contract. Concurrently, Tchenguiz filed a lawsuit in Israel against Black Cube, alleging fraudulent invoices, an allegation denied by Black Cube. Both lawsuits were dropped in a settlement agreement, the details of which are undisclosed.\n\nIn April 2016, two of the company employees were arrested in Bucharest on suspicions of spying, phishing and cyber harassing the chief prosecutor of the Romanian National Anticorruption Directorate, Laura Codruța Kövesi and people close to her. The two employees were eventually convicted on charges of hacking and harassment. After sentencing, the company reached an understanding with the Romanian authorities and the two employees were released and returned to Israel after a few months. At the time of the arrest, Black Cube denied any wrongdoing, saying that they were working under contract from the highest political powers in Bucharest and that \"all of Black Cube’s employees follow local law to the letter, and the allegations against them are unfounded and untrue\". The Romanian government and Romanian Police denied the existence of any such contract.\n\nIn November 2017, Ronan Farrow reported in \"The New Yorker\" that film executive Harvey Weinstein hired Black Cube in order to stop the publication of the abuse allegations against him. Using false identities, private investigators from Black Cube tracked and met journalists and actresses, in particular Rose McGowan, who later publicly accused Weinstein of rape. Over the course of a year, Weinstein had Black Cube and other agencies \"target, or collect information on, dozens of individuals, and compile psychological profiles that sometimes focussed on their personal or sexual histories.\"\n\nIn November 2017, Black Cube set up a fake recruitment firm, and flew an employee and a former employee of a hedge fund company to London for fake job interviews, in order to gain proprietary information about the hedge fund, according to \"The New York Times\". Black Cube refused to comment. In New York State, private investigators are required to be licensed, but the Times couldn't find a record of a license for Black Cube or B.C. Strategy.\n\nIn March 2018, Black Cube and Cambridge Analytica each denied a Cambridge Analytica ex-employee’s statement that the company had hired Black Cube's services. In April 2018, Brittany Kaiser, a senior manager at Cambridge Analytica affirmed the denials and testified in front of the British Parliament that Black Cube is not the company they worked with.\n\nIn May 2018, Black Cube was accused of using false identities to seek damaging information about former Obama administration officials and help the Trump administration undermine the Iran nuclear deal. Black Cube has responded by stating that it has no relation to the Trump administration, to Trump aides or to the Iran nuclear deal. In August 2018, \"The New Yorker\" connected Black Cube's research to a memo which circulated in the Trump White House in early 2017 and alleged that former Obama officials were conspiring with reporters \"to undermine President Trump's foreign policy\" to save Obamacare and the Iran deal.\n\n\n"}

The definition has also been extended to include the common structure, principles and practices necessary to drive the organization.\n\nDiversified industrial companies like Ingersoll Rand, Honeywell, and Danaher have adopted a standard, common collection of business processes and/or business process improvement methodologies which they use to manage strategy development and execution.

In a free market, the commodity value of a good will be reflected by its price. For example, if an acre of land can yield a net of 100 dollars loss by lying fallow, 50 dollars gain by being planted with corn, and 100 dollars gain by being planted with wheat, then that acre's commodity value is 100 dollars; the farmer is assumed to put his land to best use. The price of a commodity fluctuates around its commodity value.\n\nA commodity value expressed as a price is determined by historical, social and cultural aspects of production and distribution. Karl Marx described price as the money-name for the labour realised in a commodity. A commodity value is dependent on its utility.\n\nCommodity value is of particular significance in the study of currency. For example, the commodity value of a coin is the value of the metal of which it is made. Gold and silver coins have a high commodity value, whereas fiat coins such as modern day quarters have a low commodity value. This is of particular historical relevance when analyzed in light of Gresham's Law.\n\nBecause money becomes valuable not due to its substance, that is, its commodity value, but rather because of its performance, currencies tend to become token.\n\nAsset backed debt has a commodity value equal to the price of the collateral; a loan backed by a house has a commodity value equal to the free market price of the house. Non-collateralized debt, on the other hand, does not have a commodity value; it is valuable only insofar as it is repaid.\n\nCommodity value is an important consideration in hedging against inflation. Whereas fiat currencies can devalue, often catastrophically, currencies with considerable commodity value are known to better maintain their value; a government can print as many fiat bills as it wants with relative ease, the same is not true of mining precious metals. This leads some investors to purchase goods and debts with high commodity value, which are inherently safer than those with low, or no commodity value, minimizing risk by sacrificing potential return.\n\n"}

Straz Jr. Center for the Performing Arts opened its doors as the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center, Tampa, Florida in July 1987 and has welcomed more than 10 million guests. The Straz Center is located in northern downtown on a 9-acre (36,000 m2) site along the east bank of the Hillsborough River. As the second largest performing arts complex in the Southeastern United States (behind the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts), the 335,000-square-foot (31,100 m2) venue provides an environment for a variety of events. It has a leading Broadway series, produces grand opera, is the home of the resident professional theater company Jobsite Theater, and also presents a wide variety of concerts and other events.\n\nThe Tampa Theatre a historic U.S. theater and city landmark in the Uptown District of downtown Tampa, Florida. On January 3, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Theatre features a wide range of independent, foreign, and documentary films on a daily basis. It is Tampa's only non-profit movie theater and operating costs are largely covered by its membership program, various corporate sponsors as well as ticket sales. It has periodically been used as a backdrop for movies, MTV videos and local programming.\n\nAlso known as the River Arts District, this northwestern chunk of downtown contains the majority of nightlife and dining in the neighborhood. Important cultural landmarks such as Tampa Theatre, Straz Center for the Performing Arts, the John F. Germany public library, Glazer Children's Museum, and the Tampa Museum of Art are all centered around Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park, which has been called \"Tampa's town square\". Collectively, this area represents the focal point of downtown proper due to having a large concentration of interest points and establishments.\n\nAlthough technically downtown, Channelside is often thought to be adjacent to the main CBD. This district is the location for many prominent downtown venues. The Tampa Convention Center, Amalie Arena, Tampa Bay History Center, the Florida Aquarium and the SS American Victory are located in the Channel District. Twin 30 story condos were completed in 2007, called the Towers of Channelside. Many other residential mid and high-rises have been completed since. Many locals know the Channel District (often abbreviated to Channelside in local parlance) for its nightlife. The Channelside Bay Plaza, which has views of the downtown skyline, is located in the middle of the district. Entrepreuners have founded companies that operate NEVs to shuttle clubgoers to/from Channelside and Tampa's other core districts: Hyde Park, SoHo, Downtown, and Ybor City.\n\nThe University area is the city's educational hub and is the location of The University of Tampa a medium sized private co-educational university. Making up the City's western boundary and located just across the Hillsborough River from downtown the university is home to 6,900 students.\n\nThe northern half of downtown is undergoing huge construction projects including retail, condos, and a large grocery store. The district, which will fill the gray zone between Downtown and Historic Ybor, will be called \"Encore\" and will be a \"city within a city.\" A stimulus grant amounting $38 million was secured to help fund the project, the remaining to be derived from private funding. It is expected to create thousands of jobs for the area including at least 1,000 permanent ones. The district is being created with its African-American heritage in mind, having been built over the site of the former Central Avenue Business District and later Central Park housing project.\n\nThe Tampa Riverwalk is a 2.4 mile long walking and biking trail that winds along the edge of Tampa's downtown, running along the Hillsborough River and the Garrison Channel from the Channel District on the southeast end to Waterworks Park to the northwest. The Riverwalk's wide pathways, boardwalks, and bridges connect most of Tampa's waterfront parks, attractions, sports and entertainment venues, and hotels, including the Tampa Convention Center, Amalie Arena, the Straz Center, and many others.\n\nThe idea for the Riverwalk was first proposed by mayor Bill Poe in the mid-1970s as a way to redevelop Tampa's downtown waterfront, which had long been dominated by large warehouses, port facilities, and other industrial uses. The project was initiated in 1976 with a short walkway of wooden planks behind old Curtis Hixon Hall. However, funding and interest waned, and the project stalled for almost 30 years until mayor Pam Iorio made completing the project a city priority upon taking office in 2003. Construction began in phases in the mid-2000s, and the originally planned Riverwalk was completed in 2016, with further extensions to be added on both ends. The total cost of the completed project will be about $32 million, with most of the funds coming the city of Tampa along with a $11 million grant from the United States Department of Transportation.\n\nDowntown Tampa has 9 hotels located throughout the downtown core that create a total of 2,791 rooms. Major hotels in downtown are:\n\n\nThe following are boutique hotels:\n\n\nHillsborough Area Regional Transit (HART) operates Tampa's public transportation. HART operates many bus lines through downtown and also operates the TECO Line Streetcar System, a 2.4 miles streetcar line that extends from central downtown through Channelside and into Ybor. HART's main hub, the Marion Transit Center is located in the north end of downtown and is serviced by 30 local and express routes and a future stop for HART's MetroRapid Green Line.\n\n\n"}

It is primarily engaged in financial intermediation between and among: farmers, fishers and their organizations; micro, small and medium entrepreneurs; rural, urban and overseas workers; and professionals, pensioners and other segments of the market. It also provides mobile-money, money-transfer/remittance and cash-dispensing services to the public. As of June 2018, FICOBank has 34 banking units located in the provinces of Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Cagayan, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Pampanga, Pangasinan and Bulacan.\n\nThe Philippine Cooperative Program of the ‘70s during the Marcos administration paved the way for the organization of cooperative banks in the country. A group of technocrats led by Dr. Orlando J. Sacay, the recognized father of the Philippine cooperative banking system, worked for the enactment of Presidential Decree 175, espousing the formation of economic institutions or cooperatives. Composed of small farmers, these cooperatives were primarily organized to look after their own interests.\n\nTo serve as foundation of the cooperative rural banks and area marketing cooperatives, \"samahang nayon\" (pre-cooperatives) were organized in the rural areas. Thus, the triangular approach to rural development—production (under the \"samahang nayon\"), credit (under a cooperative rural bank), and marketing (under an area marketing cooperative)—was put into operation. It was envisioned that there would be social equity, if these three vital functions of rural development will be placed in the hands of the farmers.\n\nIn 1973, the Regional Cooperative Development Program for Cagayan Valley (RCDP-CV) was launched to develop the farming communities of the region. With financial assistance from the Canadian International Development Agency, the program sought to: improve farm productivity; diversify agricultural production; increase household income; and install a system of cooperatives, as an indispensable support mechanism. The institution of the cooperative rural banking system, as a major component of the program, was in line with the recognition of the importance of rural finance for development.\n\nThe Bank was officially formed on September 10, 1976 . It was the time when the authorized representatives of two cooperatives and 47 \"samahang nayon\" unanimously agreed and voluntarily joined together to establish a cooperative rural bank in the province of Isabela. The primordial objective for its establishment was to provide financing to farmers and small entrepreneurs who have limited resources and access to banking services.\n\nOriginally, the Bank was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as First Isabela Cooperative Rural Bank Inc. (FICRBI). On February 14, 1979, it acquired its juridical personality through SEC’s stamp of approval and registration. It was re-registered with the Bureau of Cooperative Development of the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development (BCOD-MLGCD) on April 10, 1979, under Certificate of Registration No. FF-119. The Central Bank of the Philippines granted the Bank its Certificate of Authority, numbered B-1000, on December 21, 1979 to operate as a cooperative rural bank. As such, it is vested with the rights to exercise all authority and powers, to do and perform all acts and to transact all businesses, which may be legally done by rural banks under the Rural Banking Act, and to do all other things incident thereto, as may be determined by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of the Philippines (now known as Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas).\n\nThe Bank was formally inaugurated on January 2, 1980. Being a cooperative bank, FICRBI (now FICOBank) is under the supervision of both the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA). The latter was created by the enactment of Republic Act 6939. Together with Republic Act 6938 or the 1990 Cooperative Code of the Philippines, they are known as the twin Cooperative Laws of the country. In compliance with the provisions of the said laws, FICOBank obtained CDA’s confirmation of its registration, as a cooperative bank. Its Certificate of Confirmation, numbered 661, was issued by CDA on March 11, 1991.\n\nAfter staying at the CAVADECO compound in Cauayan City, Isabela for about 15 years, FICOBank moved out and began its branching initiative to other parts of the province and its neighboring provinces in the region. In 1995, it opened its first branch in Roxas, Isabela. This was followed, in succession, by its branches in Alicia and Cauayan City, both in Isabela, in 1996. The Maddela Branch in Quirino province was opened in 1998. In the same year, its Jones Branch, also in Isabela, became its fifth branch. In 2003, its Cauayan Branch was transferred to Santiago City. A year later, the Bank’s Corporate Office—the nerve center of its operations—was inaugurated in its present location in Cauayan City, Isabela. A branch in Dupax del Sur, the first operating unit of the Bank in the province of Nueva Vizcaya, was also opened in the same year. It was later transferred to the municipality of Solano. FICOBank established its foothold in the whole region by opening its branch in Solana, Cagayan in 2005.\n\nFew years later, two field offices in Diffun, Quirino and Aurora, Isabela were opened, and two more branches in the municipalities of Paniqui and Concepcion in Tarlac were inaugurated. Field offices in San Mateo, Ilagan City, Echague, Tumauini and Cabagan—all in Isabela—and in Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya were opened, one after the other. The Bank also opened one branch each in the municipalities of Dinalupihan and Orani in Bataan and in Cabanatuan City in Nueva Ecija, all in Region III. \n\nIn 2009, FICOBank opened its five new branches, one in Cagayan and four in Pangasinan. The northernmost town of Aparri is the site of the new branch in Cagayan, while the municipalities of Umingan, Malasiqui, Lingayen and Mangaldan are the locations of the new branches of the Bank in the province of Pangasinan. The Orani Branch in Bataan was also transferred to Urdaneta City in Pangasinan in the same year. The Bank’s 27th operating unit was officially opened in Tuguegarao City in 2010. \n\nIts field offices were converted into extension offices, and all became full-fledged branches afterward. Its banking offices in Umingan (Pangasinan), Cabagan (Isabela) and Mangaldan (Pangasinan) were transferred to Guimba (Nueva Ecija), Gapan City (Nueva Ecija) and San Fernando City (Pampanga), respectively. Later on, five more branches were opened in Cauayan City (Isabela), Baliwag (Bulacan), and San Jose City, Rizal and Zaragoza (all in Nueva Ecija). In December 2017, the Bank inaugurated its 33rd banking unit in Abulug (Cagayan). And six (6) months later thereafter, FICOBank opened another branch in Cagayan, particularly in Gonzaga.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8831516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8831516", "title": "Jerry Grandenetti", "text": "Jerry Grandenetti\n\nCharles J. \"Jerry\" Grandenetti (April 15, 1926 – February 19, 2010) was an American comic book artist and advertising art director, best known for his work with writer-artist Will Eisner on the celebrated comics feature \"The Spirit\", and for his decade-and-a-half run on many DC Comics war series. He also co-created the DC comic book \"Prez\" with Joe Simon.\n\nPop artist Roy Lichtenstein's 1962 drawing \"Jet Pilot\" is based on a Grandenetti comic-book panel on the cover of DC's \"All-American Men of War\" #89 (cover-dated Feb. 1962), and Lichtenstein's 1964 triptych \"As I Opened Fire\" is based on panels by Grandenetti in \"Wingmate of Doom\" in issue #90 (April 1962).\n\nBorn in the village of Bronxville in the town of Eastchester, New York, a suburb of New York City, Jerry Grandenetti studied art and architectural drawing at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later named the School of Visual Arts), in Manhattan. He did World War II military service in the U.S. Navy \"in 1942 or 1943\", he recalled, and after the war attended Brooklyn's Pratt Institute on the G.I. Bill. In either 1946 or 1948 (accounts differ), he was making the rounds of comic-book companies and met Everett M. \"Busy\" Arnold, publisher of Quality Comics. Arnold had no position for him but sent Grandenetti to Will Eisner, writer-artist of the Sunday-newspaper comic-book section starring Eisner's celebrated character the Spirit. Grandenetti hired on as an art assistant. As \"The Comics Journal\" editor-publisher Gary Groth wrote, \"By the late '40s, Eisner's participation in the strip had dwindled to a largely supervisory role. ... Eisner hired Jerry Grandenetti and Jim Dixon to occasionally ink his pencils. By 1950, [Jules] Feiffer was writing most of the strips, and Grandenetti, Dixon, and Al Wenzel were drawing them\", with Grandenetti penciling as a ghost-artist, under Eisner's byline.\n\n\"Working for Eisner was exciting\", Grandenetti recalled in 2005. \"Although there was no such thing as teaching or showing you how to develop your craft. ... Before [the feature's] demise he tried everything. Had me penciling 'The Spirit'. Later on it was Wally Wood\", who drew it through to its end in 1952, \"but nothing could save 'The Spirit'! Sad, too. It was probably the greatest comic strip ever created\".\n\nIn 1949, Eisner, in his sideline as a comics packager, created the feature \"Secret Files of Dr. Drew\" for Fiction House. Grandenetti said Eisner instructed him to draw it \"in the Eisner style. Which I did, badly. Anyway, after a couple of stories I began to do my own thing\". The eight-page story \"The Strange Case of the Absent Floor\" in \"Rangers Comics\" #47 (June 1949), which he both penciled and inked, marked Grandenetti's first credited comics art, and he remained on the feature (scripted by Eisner's office manager and future journalist Marilyn Mercer) through #60 (Aug. 1951). Grandenetti also drew \"Senorita Rio\" stories for the same publisher's \"Fight Comics\".\n\nAfter doing a small amount of work for Lev Gleason Publications' \"Boy Comics\" #52 (April 1960), Media's \"Mister Universe\" #1 (July 1951), American Comics Group's \"Adventures into the Unknown\" #22 (Aug. 1951), and Prize Comics' \"Black Magic\" vol. 2, #3 (Feb. 1952), Grandenetti began his 17-year run at DC Comics.\n\nAt DC, then the leading comic-book company and the home of Batman and Superman, Grandenetti drew some of everything that was not a superhero. Beginning with \"Western Comics\" #27 (Sept. 1951), Grandenetti did Western comics (\"All-Star Western\"), crime fiction (\"Racket Squad in Action\", \"Gang Busters\", \"Mr. District Attorney\"), science fiction (\"Strange Adventures\"), and mystery-suspense (\"House of Mystery\"), but made his mark as one of DC's signature war comics artists, drawing hundreds of anthological stories and covers in a dozen years' worth of such titles as \"All-American Men of War\", \"G.I. Combat\", \"Our Army at War\", \"Our Fighting Forces\", and \"Star Spangled War Stories\".\n\nDC war-comics editor and writer Robert Kanigher recalled that on the feature \"Gunner and Sarge\" in particular, Grandenetti \"managed to get the grime and the humor of the two Marines (and, eventually their wonderful Pooch) fighting in the jungle as no one else could. Jerry liked to experiment and I had to sit on him to get him to stop it. Especially in his covers, which were outstanding, when I forced him to draw as realistically as possible\". With Kanigher, Grandenetti co-created the feature \"Mlle. Marie\", about a World War II French Resistance fighter, in \"Star Spangled War Stories\" #84 (Aug. 1959).\n\nGrandenetti became known for cover art rendered in wash-tone, also known as grey-tone, which, as comics-art historian Don Mangus describes, \"is executed as an ink-wash drawing, and then a halftone Photostat of the cover is made, the logo added, and finally the color is laid in over this statted wash drawing\", rendering a painted effect.\n\nIn late 1965, Grandenetti began freelancing for additional companies, drawing a small number of stories for Charlton Comics and Tower Comics, and penciling a Sub-Mariner story—inked by the character's creator, Golden Age of Comics legend Bill Everett—in Marvel Comics' \"Tales to Astonish\" #86 (Dec. 1966).\n\nMostly, however, Grandenetti began turning to Warren Publishing, home of the black-and-white, horror-comics magazines \"Creepy\" and \"Eerie\". Grandenetti's work for Warren, writes comics-art historian Don Mangus, \"returned to a much more expressionistic and experimental phase, building on what he had begun at Eisner's studio, or perhaps due to freedom from Kanigher’s restraints. Perhaps it was the subject matter or the fluid nature of the wash medium but whatever the case, he produced brilliant work at Warren in the late 1960s and early 1970s\". Warren would later reprint his youthful inking and background work for Will Eisner with the magazine series \"The Spirit\". Grandenetti was profiled in \"Creepy\" #42, and a self-portrait ran in \"Vampirella\" #16.\n\nConcurrently, for DC, Grandenetti succeeded Neal Adams on the 1960s run of DC's supernatural spirit of vengeance the Spectre, drawing issues #6–10 (Oct. 1966 – June 1969). Grandenetti also helped revive the 1940s DC character the Phantom Stranger, drawing the lead story in his return appearance in \"Showcase\" #80 (Feb. 1969). In \"Showcase\" #82 (May 1969), he and writer Dennis O'Neil co-created the minor sword and sorcery character Nightmaster—originally assigned to then-newcomer Bernie Wrightson, who was taken off it after his first seven pages proved disappointing.\n\nHe contributed to at least one issue of the black-and-white humor magazine \"Sick\" (#70, Oct. 1969), edited by his friend Joe Simon, the Golden Age co-creator of Captain America, then collaborated with Simon at DC on issues of \"Champion Sports\". The two then co-created the youth culture oddity \"Prez\", about the first teen president of the United States, and the one-episode misfire Green Team: Boy Millionaires, in \"1st Issue Special\" #2 (May 1975). Grandenetti penciled a parody of the TV series \"\" in the Marvel humor comic \"Arrgh!\" #4 (July 1975), for which he also drew the cover.\n\nComics historian Mark Evanier, calling Grandenetti \"[o]ne of the great individual stylists of comic books in the fifties and sixties,\" wrote that, \"As the [1960s] wore on, he got away from combat art and conventional page layouts, taking what he'd learned from [Will] Eisner and applying it in new, then-revolutionary directions. Like most artists who departed from the conventional, his work was loved by many but disliked by some. … [B]y the early seventies, Grandenetti was working so far outside even the relaxed conventions of DC Comics that he no longer quite fit in. I thought he was a marvelous, distinct talent who wasn't precisely suited to the work he was assigned, like \"The Spectre\", \"Prez\" and \"Nightmaster\".\n\nGrandenetti continued to freelance occasional stories for DC through at least \"G.I. Combat\" #270 (Oct. 1984).\n\nIn 1990, Grandenetti became an art director at the large advertising agency Young & Rubicam. Breaking into advertising, he recalled, \"wasn't really [tough] because, unlike a lot of comic book illustrators, all of the time I had my eyes set elsewhere. I was developing that ability, while at the same time working for the comic book companies, by doing spot drawings and illustrations for small agencies. By the time I was ready, I had this well developed portfolio so I was able to break in\".\n\nAs of 2005, Grandenetti was freelancing for ad agencies in New York City, and doing fine art paintings in watercolor, acrylics, and mixed media.\n\nGrandenetti, who lived in Bellport, New York, on Long Island, died at age 83 at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in nearby East Patchogue, New York. The official cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest, though he also had metastatic cancer.\n\nPop artist Roy Lichtenstein's 1962 drawing \"Jet Pilot\" is based on a Grandenetti comic-book panel on the cover of DC's \"All-American Men of War\" #89 (Feb. 1962). Lichtenstein's 1964 triptych \"As I Opened Fire\" is based on panels by Grandenetti in \"Wingmate of Doom\" in issue #90 (April 1962).\n\n"}
{"id": "503169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=503169", "title": "John List", "text": "John List\n\nJohn Emil List (September 17, 1925 – March 21, 2008) was an American mass murderer and long-time fugitive. On November 9, 1971, he killed his wife, mother, and three children in their home in Westfield, New Jersey, then disappeared. He had planned the murders so that nearly a month passed before anyone suspected that anything was amiss.\n\nAs he eluded justice for nearly 18 years, List assumed a new identity and remarried. He was finally apprehended in Virginia on June 1, 1989, after the story of his murders was broadcast on the Fox television program \"America's Most Wanted\". After extradition to New Jersey, he was convicted on five counts of first degree murder and sentenced to five consecutive terms of life imprisonment without parole.\n\nList gave critical financial problems, and his perception that his family was falling away from God, as his rationale. Killing them, he allegedly reasoned, would assure their souls a place in Heaven, where he hoped eventually to join them. He died in prison in 2008 at the age of 82.\n\nBorn in Bay City, Michigan, List was the only child of German-American parents, John Frederick List (1859–1944) and Alma Maria Barbara Florence (Hubinger) List (1887–1971). Like his father, he was a devout Lutheran and a Sunday school teacher. In 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in the infantry as a laboratory technician during World War II. After his discharge in 1946, he enrolled at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration and a master's degree in accounting, and was commissioned a second lieutenant through ROTC.\n\nIn November 1950, as the Korean War escalated, List was recalled to active military service. At Fort Eustis, in Virginia, he met Helen Morris Taylor, the widow of an infantry officer killed in action in Korea, who lived nearby with her daughter, Brenda. John and Helen married on December 1, 1951, in Baltimore, and the family moved to northern California where List served as an Army accountant.\n\nAfter completion of his second tour in 1952, List worked for an accounting firm in Detroit, and then as an audit supervisor at a paper company in Kalamazoo, where their three children were born. By 1959, List had risen to general supervisor of the company's accounting department; but Helen, an alcoholic, had become increasingly unstable. In 1960, Brenda married and left the household, and List moved with the remainder of his family to Rochester, New York, to take a job with Xerox, where he eventually became director of accounting services. In 1965, he accepted a position as vice president and comptroller at a bank in Jersey City, New Jersey, and moved with his wife, children, and mother into Breeze Knoll, a 19-room Victorian mansion at 431 Hillside Avenue in Westfield.\n\nOn November 9, 1971, List methodically murdered his entire immediate family, using his own 9mm Steyr 1912 semi-automatic handgun and his father's Colt .22 caliber revolver. While his children were at school he shot his wife Helen, 46, in the back of the head, and then his mother Alma, 84, above the left eye. As his daughter Patricia, 16, and younger son Frederick, 13, arrived home from school, he shot each of them in the back of the head. After making himself lunch, List drove to his bank to close his own and his mother's bank accounts, and then to Westfield High School to watch his elder son John Jr., 15, play in a soccer game. He drove the boy home, then shot him repeatedly in the chest and face. Because his son tried to resist, List shot him repeatedly until he was sure the boy was dead.\n\nList placed the bodies of his wife and children on sleeping bags in the mansion's ballroom. He left his mother's body in her apartment in the attic. In a five-page letter to his pastor, found on the desk in his study, he wrote that he saw too much evil in the world, and he had killed his family to save their souls. He then cleaned the various crime scenes, carefully cut his own picture out of every family photograph in the house, tuned a radio to a religious station, and departed.\n\nThe murders were not discovered until December 7, nearly a month later, due in part to the family's reclusiveness and refusal to socialize, and in part to notes sent by List to the children's schools and part-time jobs stating that the family would be visiting Helen's mother in North Carolina for several weeks. He also stopped milk, mail and newspaper deliveries. Neighbors noticed that all of the mansion's lights were illuminated day and night, with no apparent activity within. Finally, as the lights began burning out one by one, they called police.\n\nThe case became the most notorious crime in New Jersey history since the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby. A nationwide manhunt was launched. Police investigated hundreds of leads without success. All reliable photographs of List had been destroyed. The family car was found parked at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City, but there was no evidence that he had boarded a flight. Alma was flown to Frankenmuth, Michigan, and interred at the Saint Lorenz Lutheran Cemetery. Helen and her three children were buried at Fairview Cemetery in Westfield.\n\nEighteen years later, on May 21, 1989, the murders were recounted on the Fox television program \"America's Most Wanted\", which at the time had been on the air less than a year. The broadcast featured an age-progressed clay bust, sculpted by forensic artist Frank Bender, which turned out to bear a close resemblance to List's actual appearance. List was located and arrested in Virginia less than two weeks after the episode was broadcast.\n\nIn 1971, as the FBI later discovered, List had traveled by train from New Jersey to Michigan, and then Colorado. He settled in Denver in early 1972 and took an accounting job as Robert Peter \"Bob\" Clark, the name of one of his college classmates (although the real Bob Clark later asserted that he had never known List). From 1979 to 1986 he was the comptroller at a paper box manufacturer outside Denver. He joined a Lutheran congregation and ran a car pool for shut-in church members. At one religious gathering, he met an Army PX clerk named Delores Miller and married her in 1985. In February 1988, the couple moved to Midlothian, Virginia, where List, still using the name Bob Clark, resumed work as an accountant.\n\nOn June 1, 1989, he was arrested at a Richmond accounting firm after a Denver neighbor viewed the \"America's Most Wanted\" broadcast, recognized the profile, and alerted authorities. He continued to stand by his alias for several months, even after extradition to Union County, New Jersey, in late 1989; but finally, faced with irrefutable evidence—including a fingerprint match with List's military records, and then with evidence found at the crime scene—he confessed his true identity on February 16, 1990.\n\nAt trial, List testified that he was faced with grave financial difficulties in 1971: he had lost his job at the Jersey City bank. To avoid sharing this humiliating development with his family, he spent each workday at the Westfield train station, reading newspapers until it was time to come home. He skimmed money from his mother's bank accounts to avoid defaulting on his mortgage. He was also dealing with his wife's alcoholism and her untreated tertiary syphilis, contracted from her first husband and concealed for 18 years. According to trial testimony, Helen had pressured List into marriage by falsely claiming that she was pregnant, then insisted that they marry in Maryland, which does not require blood testing to obtain a marriage license. Though her health progressively worsened, she said nothing to List or her physicians until 1969, when a check-up revealed the condition. By then the disease and her excessive alcohol consumption had, according to testimony, \"transformed her from an attractive young woman to an unkempt and paranoid recluse\" who frequently—and often publicly—disparaged List, comparing his sexual skills unfavorably with those of her first husband.\n\nA court-appointed psychiatrist testified that List suffered from obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, and that he saw only two solutions to his situation: accept welfare or kill his family and send their souls to Heaven. Welfare was an unacceptable option, he reasoned, because it would expose him and his family to ridicule and violate his authoritarian father's teachings regarding the care and protection of family members.\n\nOn April 12, 1990, List was convicted of five counts of first degree murder. At his sentencing hearing he denied direct responsibility for his actions: \"I feel that because of my mental state at the time, I was unaccountable for what happened. I ask all affected by this for their forgiveness, understanding and prayer.\" The judge was unpersuaded: \"John Emil List is without remorse and without honor,\" he said. \"After 18 years, five months and 22 days, it is now time for the voices of Helen, Alma, Patricia, Frederick and John F. List to rise from the grave.\" He imposed a sentence of five terms of life imprisonment, to be served consecutively, the maximum permissible penalty at the time.\n\nList filed an appeal of his convictions on grounds that his judgment had been impaired by post-traumatic stress disorder due to his military service. He also argued that the letter he left behind at the crime scene, essentially his confession, was a confidential communication to his pastor and therefore inadmissible as evidence. A federal appeals court rejected both arguments.\n\nList later expressed a degree of remorse for his crimes: \"I wish I had never done what I did,\" he said. \"I've regretted my action and prayed for forgiveness ever since.\" When asked by Connie Chung in 2002 why he had not taken his own life, he said he believed that suicide would have barred him from Heaven, where he hoped to be reunited with his family.\n\nList died of complications from pneumonia at age 82 on March 21, 2008, while in prison custody at St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton, New Jersey. In reporting his death, the Newark \"Star-Ledger\" referred to him as \"the bogeyman of Westfield.\"\n\nBreeze Knoll was destroyed by arson on August 20, 1972, approximately 10 months after the murders. The crime remains officially unsolved. Destroyed along with the home was the ballroom's stained glass skylight, rumored to be a signed Tiffany original, worth at least $100,000 at the time (). A new house was built on the site in 1974.\n\nOver the years, List and his crimes have furnished inspiration for a number of movies and documentaries. Examples include the 1993 film \"\", in which List was portrayed by Robert Blake; the 1987 film \"The Stepfather\" and its 2009 remake; and the character Keyser Söze in the 1995 film \"The Usual Suspects\".\n\nA 1996 episode of the series \"Forensic Files\" discussed the List murders. A 2003 episode of the A&E series \"American Justice\" also detailed the case and featured an interview with List.\n\nIn 1972, List was proposed as a suspect in the D. B. Cooper air piracy case because of the timing of his disappearance (two weeks prior to the airline hijacking), multiple matches to the hijacker's description, and the reasoning that \"a fugitive accused of mass murder has nothing to lose\". List was questioned by FBI investigators after his capture, but he denied any involvement in the Cooper case. While his name is still occasionally mentioned in Cooper articles and documentaries, no direct evidence implicates him, and the FBI no longer considers him a suspect.\n\nIn 2008, John Walsh, the host of \"America's Most Wanted\", donated the age-progressed bust by Frank Bender that played a pivotal role in List's apprehension to a forensic science exhibit at the now defunct National Museum of Crime & Punishment in Washington, DC.\n\nIn 2015, the story was covered in Season 2, Episode 2 of the Investigation Discovery show, \"Your Worst Nightmare.\" The episode was named \"Murder House\" and premiered on November 18, 2015.\n\nXavier Dupont de Ligonnès, a French man suspected of murdering his wife and four children in April 2011. They were found buried under the back patio of the family home in Nantes. In the following days, Xavier was caught on CCTV staying at several hotels in different parts of France using a fake name, before disappearing. No trace of him has ever been found.\n\n\n"}

He is the founder and the former CEO of New York-based Comverse Technology. In 2006, he was charged with multiple counts of fraud and related offenses pertaining to irregularities in trading of Comverse stock; he subsequently fled to Namibia, a nation which has no extradition treaty with the US.\n\nAlexander founded Comverse Technology (NASDAQ: CMVT) in 1982 and built it up from a 3-person Israeli startup to employing over 5,000, becoming the leading provider of software and systems for telecommunication companies worldwide. Comverse's success led to its inclusion in the NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500 indices.\n\nAlexander was born on May 4, 1952, into a middle-class family in Kfar Saba, Israel. His mother was a school teacher, and his father an officer in the signal corps of the Israeli Defense Forces, and later, the Managing Director of the Israeli National Oil Company.\n\nFollowing military service, Alexander enrolled in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, receiving a BA in Economics \"magna cum laude\" in 1977. In 1978 he traveled to the United States earning an MBA at New York University.\n\nIn his early years in New York, he met an electrical engineer and together with his brother in law, a professor of Computer Science at Columbia University, the three conceived voice mail technology and developed the idea of what was to become Comverse Technology. The founders understood already then that communications will be a big market, and pioneered the voice mail systems that today are used by telecoms worldwide to support telephony services.\n\nIn 1981, fresh with his NYU MBA, Alexander returned to Israel to bootstrap Comverse. In 1986, after struggling for over 4 years with the company reaching the brink of bankruptcy, the two other founders left their operational roles, and subsequently left the company.\n\nUpon taking the helm, Alexander made three key strategic decisions:\n\nWithin a short amount of time, Comverse was back on its feet. A major breakthrough came when Alexander convinced Swiss telecom giant Ascom to invest US$6 million in the company in the mid 1980s, providing Comverse the capital it needed at that time. In 1986, Alexander was able to take Comverse public on the NASDAQ.\n\nIn 1997, Comverse bought its main competitor for US$700 million, at the time the largest acquisition to date for an Israeli-based company. Comverse Technology, Inc., which owns 100% of Comverse, also owns majority equity in several other companies, including Verint and Ulticom. It has over US$1.5 billion in sales to over 450 telecoms in 120 countries supporting more than 450 million subscribers worldwide. As of March 2006, the company employed approximately 6000 people in over 50 countries, had a market capitalization of approximately US$6 billion, and over US$2.2 billion in cash.\n\nAlexander also formerly owned 25% of the Israeli basketball team Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.\n\nFor his achievements over the last 25 years, Alexander received the several business awards. He came 12th in Chief Executive Magazine's: \"Market Value Added Ranking\" of the CEOs of the 1000 largest US corporations, ranking those that \"created the most wealth for shareholders\". The successes of Alexander and Comverse were recognized by the world's leading publications including Barron's, Bloomberg, Business Week, Financial World, Forbes, Fortune, International Business, and Wall Street Journal. Alexander was awarded \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by both Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche.\n\nThe Wall Street Transcript, naming Kobi Alexander as the Gold Award Winner in the Computer Telephony industry said: \"... an exceptional management team have yielded consistently outstanding revenues, earnings, and shareholder value. Alexander has set some very high standards for this company and this industry.\"\nIn addition to Comverse Technology, Alexander spun off and took public several other companies including Ulticom (NASDAQ: ULCM) and Verint Systems (NASDAQ: VRNT). Companies under his leadership were listed in Barron's 500, Business Week: \"Hot Growth Companies\", \"Business Week 50\", Business Week: \"The Information Technology 100\", Financial World: \"America's Best 100 Growth Companies\", Fortune: \"100 Fastest Growing Companies\"', International Business: \"100 Fastest-Growing International Companies\", Wall Street Journal: \"10-Year Best Performers\", and Wall Street Journal \"Honor Roll\", among others. In 2006, Comverse was named one of Institutional Investor: America's Most Shareholder-Friendly Companies\". \"As CEO of Comverse, Alexander was sought out by the likes of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who slipped away from official meetings in 2000 and steered his motorcade through a pot-holed section of Tel Aviv to meet with him.\" He served as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of CTI from 1987 to May 1, 2006, when he resigned during an investigation being conducted by a Special Committee of CTI's Board of Directors into the timing of CTI's stock option grants. He was Chairman of several CTI subsidiaries, including Verint Systems and Ulticom.\n\nOn July 31, 2006, Alexander was charged by United States Department of Justice authorities with multiple charges of conspiracy to commit various types of fraud (including securities fraud, wire fraud and mail fraud), as well as with related offences, all relating to the timing of Comverse's stock option grants.\n\nAfter Alexander left the United States on June 21, 2006 on a pre-planned annual vacation in Israel, his lawyers arranged with American authorities that he would return to face indictment on July 30, 2006; however, he instead traveled to Germany. On July 31 a warrant was issued for his arrest.\n\nOn August 9, 2006 the United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Alexander, along with alleged co-conspirators William F. Sorin, Comverse's former Senior General Counsel, and David Kreinberg, Comverse's former Chief Financial Officer. The complaint makes nine claims of violation of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including fraud (First and Second Claims), and falsification of books, records or accounts (Fourth Claim). Through this action, the Commission is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil damages, and a prohibition against any of the defendants becoming officers of a securities-issuing entity under SEC jurisdiction.\n\nAlexander transferred over 40 million dollars from his personal U.S. bank account to his personal bank account in Israel. He was arrested by Interpol in Windhoek, Namibia on September 27, 2006. He was released on bail on October 3, 2006. According to a Reuters report of April 23, 2007, the Namibian government described Alexander as \"very passionate\" about the country and its people; Alexander has promised to boost academic interest in science and technology in Namibia by establishing an annual scholarship for primary and secondary level students. He has also begun to introduce advanced technology to the country with his development of a low budget solar powered housing project for 100 low-income Namibian families.\n\nDespite fighting extradition to the United States, Alexander announced on January 28, 2008 that he has filed suit against Comverse. Alexander claims the firm owes him $72 million in severance, unexercised stock options, and bonus pay.\n\nOn July 3, 2008 a Namibian court split decisions for and against Alexander granting his request to remove the judge currently assigned to preside at his extradition hearing while declining to assign a magistrate of his choosing. Additionally, the Namibian High Court did not, at Alexander's attorneys' request, rule unconstitutional the Extradition Act which would allow Alexander to be imprisoned at some point during the upcoming extradition hearing. As reported by Bloomberg.com on November 19, 2008 a hearing to request Alexander's extradition to the United States was postponed until March 4, 2009 pending Alexander's appeal to Namibia's Supreme Court regarding which judge should hear the case. This appeal, not yet scheduled, will likely be adjudicated in March or April 2009.\nThe final outcome of the extradition proceedings can be several years away pending the appeals process. Despite impending extradition proceedings, Alexander has invested heavily within the country.\n\nIn 2011, Alexander settled the civil charges with the SEC and gave up bank accounts worth $46 million to federal authorities.\n\nOn Aug 22, 2016 it was reported by Scott Cohn on CNBC that Alexander will return to the US to face criminal charges. On February 23, 2017, Judge Nicholas Garaufis of the Eastern District of New York, sentenced Alexander to 30 months in prison. On March 1, 2018, Alexander was transferred to Israel to carry out his remaining sentence.\n\nIn October, 2018 it was reported that he had recently been released from prison.\n"}

Following Kristallnacht on 9–10 November 1938, which saw the huge plate glass windows of the Bernheimer-Haus smashed, the family was sent to Dachau concentration camp. The Mexican government intervened, as his grandfather Otto Bernheimer was the Mexican honorary consul in Munich.

{"id": "10219801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10219801", "title": "Marketing mix modeling", "text": "Marketing mix modeling\n\nMarketing mix modeling (MMM) is statistical analysis such as multivariate regressions on sales and marketing time series data to estimate the impact of various marketing tactics (marketing mix) on sales and then forecast the impact of future sets of tactics. It is often used to optimize advertising mix and promotional tactics with respect to sales revenue or profit.\n\nThe techniques were developed by econometricians and were first applied to consumer packaged goods, since manufacturers of those goods had access to good data on sales and marketing support. The first companies dedicated to the commercial development of MMM were MMA (then Media Marketing Assessment) started in 1990 and the Hudson River Group founded in 1989. Other early pioneer-users of econometric modeling were the ATG group at the advertising agency JWT in the 1990s and later incorporated into MindShare ATG, BrandScience at Omnicom, and the specialist modeling agency OHAL since the late 1980s. These agencies took MMM from being a little-used and academic discipline to being a widespread and common marketing tool. Improved availability of data, massively greater computing power, and the pressure to measure and optimize marketing spend has driven the explosion in popularity as a marketing tool. In the recent times MMM has found acceptance as a trustworthy marketing tool among the major consumer marketing companies. Often in the digital media context, MMM is referred to as attribution modeling.\n\nThe term marketing mix was developed by Neil Borden who first started using the phrase in 1949. “An executive is a mixer of ingredients, who sometimes follows a recipe as he goes along, sometimes adapts a recipe to the ingredients immediately available, and sometimes experiments with or invents ingredients no one else has tried.\" (Culliton, J. 1948)\n\nAccording to Borden, \"When building a marketing program to fit the needs of his firm, the marketing manager has to weigh the behavioral forces and then juggle marketing elements in his mix with a keen eye on the resources with which he has to work.\" (Borden, N. 1964 pg 365).\n\nE. Jerome McCarthy (McCarthy, J. 1960), was the first person to suggest the four P's of marketing – price, promotion, product and place (distribution) – which constitute the most common variables used in constructing a marketing mix. According to McCarthy the marketers essentially have these four variables which they can use while crafting a marketing strategy and writing a marketing plan. In the long term, all four of the mix variables can be changed, but in the short term it is difficult to modify the product or the distribution channel.\n\nAnother set of marketing mix variables were developed by Albert Frey (Frey, A. 1961) who classified the marketing variables into two categories: the offering, and process variables. The \"offering\" consists of the product, service, packaging, brand, and price. The \"process\" or \"method\" variables included advertising, promotion, sales promotion, personal selling, publicity, distribution channels, marketing research, strategy formation, and new product development.\n\nRecently, Bernard Booms and Mary Bitner built a model consisting of seven P's (Booms, B. and Bitner, M. 1981). They added \"People\" to the list of existing variables, in order to recognize the importance of the human element in all aspects of marketing. They added \"process\" to reflect the fact that services, unlike physical products, are experienced as a process at the time that they are purchased. Desktop modeling tools such as Micro TSP have made this kind of statistical analysis part of the mainstream now. Most advertising agencies and strategy consulting firms offer MMM services to their clients.\n\nMarketing mix modeling is an analytical approach that uses historic information, such as syndicated point-of-sale data and companies’ internal data, to quantify the sales impact of various marketing activities. Mathematically, this is done by establishing a simultaneous relation of various marketing activities with the sales, in the form of a linear or a non-linear equation, through the statistical technique of regression. MMM defines the effectiveness of each of the marketing elements in terms of its contribution to sales-volume, effectiveness (volume generated by each unit of effort), efficiency (sales volume generated divided by cost) and ROI. These learnings are then adopted to adjust marketing tactics and strategies, optimize the marketing plan and also to forecast sales while simulating various scenarios.\n\nThis is accomplished by setting up a model with the sales volume/value as the dependent variable and independent variables created out of the various marketing efforts. The creation of variables for Marketing Mix Modeling is a complicated affair and is as much an art as it is a science. The balance between automated modeling tools crunching large data sets versus the artisan econometrician is an ongoing debate in MMM, with different agencies and consultants taking a position at certain points in this spectrum. Once the variables are created, multiple iterations are carried out to create a model which explains the volume/value trends well. Further validations are carried out, either by using a validation data, or by the consistency of the business results.\n\nThe output can be used to analyze the impact of the marketing elements on various dimensions. The contribution of each element as a percentage of the total plotted year on year is a good indicator of how the effectiveness of various elements changes over the years. The yearly change in contribution is also measured by a due-to analysis which shows what percentage of the change in total sales is attributable to each of the elements. For activities like television advertising and trade promotions, more sophisticated analysis like effectiveness can be carried out. This analysis tells the marketing manager the incremental gain in sales that can be obtained by increasing the respective marketing element by one unit. If detailed spend information per activity is available then it is possible to calculate the Return on Investment of the marketing activity. Not only is this useful for reporting the historical effectiveness of the activity, it also helps in optimizing the marketing budget by identifying the most and least efficient marketing activities.\n\nOnce the final model is ready, the results from it can be used to simulate marketing scenarios for a ‘What-if’ analysis. The marketing managers can reallocate this marketing budget in different proportions and see the direct impact on sales/value. They can optimize the budget by allocating spends to those activities which give the highest return on investment.\n\nSome MMM approaches like to include multiple products or brands fighting against each other in an industry or category model - where cross-price relationships and advertising share of voice is considered as important for wargaming.\n\nMarketing-mix models decompose total sales into two components:\n\nBase Sales: This is the natural demand for the product driven by economic factors like pricing, long-term trends, seasonality, and also qualitative factors like brand awareness and brand loyalty.\n\nIncremental Sales: Incremental sales are the component of sales driven by marketing and promotional activities. This component can be further decomposed into sales due to each marketing component like Television advertising or Radio advertising, Print Advertising (magazines, newspapers etc.), Coupons, Direct Mail, Internet, Feature or Display Promotions and Temporary Price Reductions. Some of these activities have short-term returns (Coupons, Promotions), while others have longer term returns (TV, Radio, Magazine/Print).\n\nMarketing-Mix analyses are typically carried out using Linear Regression Modeling. Nonlinear and lagged effects are included using techniques like Advertising Adstock transformations. Typical output of such analyses include a decomposition of total annual sales into contributions from each marketing component, a.k.a. Contribution pie-chart.\n\nAnother standard output is a decomposition of year-over year sales growth/decline, a.k.a. ‘Due-to charts’.\n\nThe very break-up of sales volume into base (volume that would be generated in absence of any marketing activity) and incremental (volume generated by marketing activities in the short run) across time gain gives wonderful insights. The base grows or declines across longer periods of time while the activities generating the incremental volume in the short run also impact the base volume in the long run. The variation in the base volume is a good indicator of the strength of the brand and the loyalty it commands from its users.\n\nMarket mix modeling can determine the sales impact generated by individual media such as television, magazine, and online display ads. In some cases it can be used to determine the impact of individual advertising campaigns or even ad executions upon sales. For example, for TV advertising activity, it is possible to examine how each ad execution has performed in the market in terms of its impact on sales volume. MMM can also provide information on TV correlations at different media weight levels, as measured by Gross Rating Points (GRP) in relation to sales volume response within a time frame, be it a week or a month. Information can also be gained on the minimum level of GRPs (threshold limit) in a week that need to be aired in order to make an impact, and conversely, the level of GRPs at which the impact on volume maximizes (saturation limit) and that the further activity does not have any payback. While not all MMM's will be able to produce definitive answers to all questions, some additional areas in which insights can sometimes be gained include: 1) the effectiveness of 15-second vis-à-vis 30-second executions; 2)comparisons in ad performance when run during prime-time vis-à-vis off-prime-time dayparts; 3) comparisons into the direct and the halo effect of TV activity across various products or sub-brands. The role of new product based TV activity and the equity based TV activity in growing the brand can also be compared. GRP's are converted into reach (i.e. GRPs are divided by the average frequency to get the percentage of people actually watching the advertisement). This is a better measure for modeling TV.\n\nTrade promotion is a key activity in every marketing plan. It is aimed at increasing sales in the short term by employing promotion schemes which effectively increases the customer awareness of the business and its products. The response of consumers to trade promotions is not straight forward and is the subject of much debate. Non-linear models exist to simulate the response. Using MMM we can understand the impact of trade promotion at generating incremental volumes. It is possible to obtain an estimate of the volume generated per promotion event in each of the different retail outlets by region. This way we can identify the most and least effective trade channels. If detailed spend information is available we can compare the Return on Investment of various trade activities like Every Day Low Price, Off-Shelf Display. We can use this information to optimize the trade plan by choosing the most effective trade channels and targeting the most effective promotion activity.\n\nPrice increases of the brand impact the sales negatively. This effect can be captured through modeling the price in MMM. The model provides the price elasticity of the brand which tells us the percentage change in the sales for each percentage change in price. Using this, the marketing manager can evaluate the impact of a price change decision.\n\nFor the element of distribution, we can know how the volume will move by changing distribution efforts or, in other words, by each percentage shift in the width or the depth of distribution. This can be identified specifically for each channel and even for each kind of outlet for off-take sales. In view of these insights, the distribution efforts can be prioritized for each channel or store-type to get the maximum out of the same. A recent study of a laundry brand showed that the incremental volume through 1% more presence in a neighborhood Kirana store is 180% greater than that through 1% more presence in a supermarket. Based upon the cost of such efforts, managers identified the right channel to invest more for distribution.\n\nWhen a new product is launched, the associated publicity and promotions typically results in higher volume generation than expected. This extra volume cannot be completely captured in the model using the existing variables. Often special variables to capture this incremental effect of launches are used. The combined contribution of these variables and that of the marketing effort associated with the launch will give the total launch contribution. Different launches can be compared by calculating their effectiveness and ROI.\n\nThe impact of competition on the brand sales is captured by creating the competition variables accordingly. The variables are created from the marketing activities of the competition like television advertising, trade promotions, product launches etc. The results from the model can be used to identify the biggest threat to own brand sales from competition. The cross-price elasticity and the cross-promotional elasticity can be used to devise appropriate response to competition tactics. A successful competitive campaign can be analyzed to learn valuable lesson for the own brand.\n\nTypical MMM studies provide the following insights\n\nOver the past 20 years many large companies, particularly consumer packaged goods firms, have adopted MMM. Many Fortune 500 companies such as P&G, AT&T, Kraft, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have made MMM an integral part of their marketing planning. This has also been made possible due to the availability of specialist firms that are now providing MMM services.\n\nMarketing mix models were more popular initially in the CPG industry and quickly spread to Retail and Pharma industries because of the availability of Syndicated Data in these industries (primarily from Nielsen Company and IRI and to a lesser extent from NPD Group and Bottom Line Analytics and Gain Theory). Availability of Time-series data is crucial to robust modeling of marketing-mix effects and with the systematic management of customer data through CRM systems in other industries like Telecommunications, Financial Services, Automotive and Hospitality industries helped its spread to these industries. In addition competitive and industry data availability through third-party sources like Forrester Research's Ultimate Consumer Panel (Financial Services), Polk Insights (Automotive) and Smith Travel Research (Hospitality), further enhanced the application of marketing-mix modeling to these industries. Application of marketing-mix modeling to these industries is still in a nascent stage and a lot of standardization needs to be brought about especially in these areas:\n\nThe proliferation of marketing-mix modeling was also accelerated due to the focus from Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 that required internal controls for financial reporting on significant expenses and outlays. Marketing for consumer goods can be in excess of a 10th of total revenues and until the advent of marketing-mix models, relied on qualitative or 'soft' approaches to evaluate this spend. Marketing-mix modeling presented a rigorous and consistent approach to evaluate marketing-mix investments as the CPG industry had already demonstrated. A study by American Marketing Association pointed out that top management was more likely to stress the importance of marketing accountability than middle management, suggesting a top-down push towards greater accountability.\n\nWhile marketing mix models provide much useful information, there are two key areas in which these models have limitations that should be taken into account by all of those that use these models for decision making purposes. These limitations, discussed more fully below, include:\n\n1) the focus on short-term sales can significantly under-value the importance of longer-term equity building activities; and\n\n2) when used for media mix optimization, these models have a clear bias in favor of time-specific media (such as TV commercials) versus less time-specific media (such as ads appearing in monthly magazines); biases can also occur when comparing broad-based media versus regionally or demographically targeted media.\n\nIn relation to the bias against equity building activities, marketing budgets optimized using marketing-mix models may tend too much towards efficiency because marketing-mix models measure only the short-term effects of marketing. Longer term effects of marketing are reflected in its brand equity. The impact of marketing spend on [brand equity] is usually not captured by marketing-mix models. One reason is that the longer duration that marketing takes to impact brand perception extends beyond the simultaneous or, at best, weeks-ahead impact of marketing on sales that these models measure. The other reason is that temporary fluctuation in sales due to economic and social conditions do not necessarily mean that marketing has been ineffective in building brand equity. On the contrary, it is very possible that in the short term sales and market-share could deteriorate, but brand equity could actually be higher. This higher equity should in the long run help the brand recover sales and market-share.\n\nBecause marketing-mix models suggest a marketing tactic has a positive impact on sales doesn't necessarily mean it has a positive impact on long-term brand equity. Different marketing measures impact short-term and long-term brand sales differently and adjusting the marketing portfolio to maximize either the short-term or the long-term alone will be sub-optimal. For example, the short-term positive effect of promotions on consumers’ utility induces consumers to switch to the promoted brand, but the adverse impact of promotions on brand equity carries over from period to period. Therefore, the net effect of promotions on a brand’s market share and profitability can be negative due to their adverse impact on brand. Determining marketing ROI on the basis of marketing-mix models alone can lead to misleading results. This is because marketing-mix attempts to optimize marketing-mix to increase incremental contribution, but marketing-mix also drives brand-equity, which is not part of the incremental part measured by marketing-mix model- it is part of the baseline. True 'Return on Marketing Investment' is a sum of short-term and long-term ROI. The fact that most firms use marketing-mix models only to measure the short-term ROI can be inferred from an article by Booz Allen Hamilton, which suggests that there is a significant shift away from traditional media to 'below-the-line' spending, driven by the fact that promotional spending is easier to measure. But academic studies have shown that promotional activities are in fact detrimental to long-term marketing ROI (Ataman et al., 2006). Short-term marketing-mix models can be combined with brand-equity models using brand-tracking data to measure 'brand ROI', in both the short- and long-term. Finally, the modeling process itself should not be more costly than the resulting gain in profitability; i.e. it should have a positive Return On Modeling Effort (ROME).\n\nThe second limitation of marketing mix models comes into play when advertisers attempt to use these models to determine the best media allocation across different media types. The traditional use of MMM's to compare money spent on TV versus money spent on couponing was relatively valid in that both TV commercials and the appearance of coupons (for example, in a FSI run in a newspaper) were both quite time specific. However, as the use of these models has been expanded into comparisons across a wider range of media types, extreme caution should be used.\n\nEven with traditional media such as magazine advertising, the use of MMM's to compare results across media can be problematic; while the modelers overlay models of the 'typical' viewing curves of monthly magazines, these lack in precision, and thus introduce additional variability into the equation. Thus, comparisons of the effectiveness of running a TV commercial versus the effectiveness of running a magazine ad would be biased in favor of TV, with its greater precision of measurement. As new forms of media proliferate, these limitations become even more important to consider if MMM's are to be used in attempts to quantify their effectiveness. For example, Sponsorship Marketing, Sports Affinity Marketing, Viral Marketing, Blog Marketing and Mobile Marketing all vary in terms of the time-specificity of exposure.\n\nFurther, most approaches to marketing-mix models try to include all marketing activities in aggregate at the national or regional level, but to the extent that various tactics are targeted to different demographic consumer groups, their impact may be lost. For example, Mountain Dew sponsorship of NASCAR may be targeted to NASCAR fans, which may include multiple age groups, but Mountain Dew advertising on gaming blogs may be targeted to the Gen Y population. Both of these tactics may be highly effective within the corresponding demographic groups but, when included in aggregate in a national or regional marketing-mix model, may come up as ineffective.\n\nAggregation bias, along with issues relating to variations in the time-specific natures of different media, pose serious problems when these models are used in ways beyond those for which they were originally designed. As media become even more fragmented, it is critical that these issues are taken into account if marketing-mix models are used to judge the relative effectiveness of different media and tactics.\n\nMarketing-mix models use historical performance to evaluate marketing performance and so are not an effective tool to manage marketing investments for new products. This is because the relatively short history of new products make marketing-mix results unstable. Also relationship between marketing and sales may be radically different in the launch and stable periods. For example, the initial performance of Coke Zero was really poor and showed low advertising elasticity. In spite of this Coke increased its media spend, with an improved strategy and radically improved its performance resulting in advertising effectiveness that is probably several times the effectiveness during the launch period. A typical marketing-mix model would have recommended cutting media spend and instead resorting to heavy price discounting.\n\n\n"}

It is an approach to problem solving that views \"problems\" as parts of an overall system, rather than reacting to present outcomes or events and potentially contributing to further development of the undesired issue or problem.[1] Systems thinking is a framework that is based on the belief that the component parts of a system can best be understood in the context of relationships with each other and with other systems, rather than in isolation. The only way to fully understand why a problem or element occurs and persists is to understand the part in relation to the whole.[2] Standing in contrast to Descartes's scientific reductionism and philosophical analysis, it proposes to view systems in a holistic manner. Consistent with systems philosophy, systems thinking concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entirety of the system.\n\n^ O'Connor, J. & McDermott, I.

His father Eugen Armbruster was a successful industrialist in Spain (tubes, plastics, metals, energy, banks, forests) and his mother, Trude Armbruster (née Blecher) was a renowned violinist.\n\nAt an early age, Ricardo Armbruster and his family discovered that schooling and academic life were not going to be his preferred way of advancing personally. He developed a wide interest in animals and nature in the 1950s, spending long periods at the family farm in Camorritos, Spain, and becoming a respected naturalist at a very early stage. Soon afterwards, at the age of 17, he decided to travel and learn. He spent some time at several academies and jobs in Switzerland, Germany and London, before returning to Madrid and, from there, to the American continent. First, he traveled around the United States and Mexico with his brother and friends, before accepting a job at a bookstore in Bogotá, Colombia. After feeling frustrated by the fact that the store sold books by length for decoration rather than for reading, he felt the call of the wild, embarked on a trip to the south and disappeared in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nSome time later Ricardo Armbruster reappeared in Tenerife, on the Canary Islands. He had made a living by hunting in the forest, making research films, helping national armies explore new territories and, in the end, smuggling coffee to pay for a ship fare back to Europe.\n\nBack in Spain, Ricardo Armbruster settled down, married Erika Born, another German/Spanish national, and had two children: Yaukuma (named after a Mehinaku Indian of the Xingú River Basin) and Thurit Armbruster. The couple moved to Valladolid, in the north of Spain, where Ricardo Armbruster became a successful entrepreneur but was mostly recognized for his activist ecologism and political positioning (against the Spanish State of caudillo Francisco Franco.\n\nRicardo Armbruster was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the AEORMA ecologist group, a strictly forbidden activity under the Francoist State. He was also, with Julio Valdeón Baruque, José Luis Martín, José Luis Barrigón, Carlos Santamaría, Carlos Carrasco, Manuel Conde and others, the driving force behind the creation of the Instituto Regional Castellano-Leonés, an autonomy-enhancing entity that was subject to severe persecution by Franco´s authorities.<Historia del movimiento castellano leonés>\n\nErika and Ricardo Armbruster's home in the Castillian countryside (La Corala) soon became a preferred stop for zoologists and naturalists in the early 1970s, who brought over every kind of fauna to be treated and cured. This made the premises look more like a zoo than a private home. The property also became a hot spot for debates about democracy and ecology among Spanish intellectuals, artists and oligarchs who appreciated Armbruster's views on these subjects.\n\nA rebel Christian (he married under scrutiny and press coverage following the Catholic and Lutheran rituals at a time of National Catholicism in Spain), Ricardo Armbruster died on Easter Sunday in April 1976, at the age of 32, in Ribadesella, Asturias (Spain), while scuba diving in search of eels and other sea species in the cold waters of the Cantabrian Sea.<El Norte de Castilla>\n"}

Before the introduction of machinery applicable to the spinning of silk waste, the refuse from cocoon reeling, and also from silk winding, which is now used in producing spun silk fabrics, was nearly all destroyed as being useless, with the exception of that which could be hand-combed and spun by means of the distaff and spinning wheel, a method which is still practised by some of the peasantry in India and other countries in Asia.\n\nThe supply of waste silk is drawn from the following sources:\n\n\nA silk \"throwster\" receives the silk in skein form, the thread of which consists of a number of silk fibres wound together to make a certain diameter or size, the separate fibre having actually been spun by the worm. The silk-waste spinner receives the silk in quite a different form: merely the raw material, packed in bales of various sizes and weights, the contents being a much-tangled mass of all lengths of fibre mixed with much foreign matter, such as ends of straws, twigs, leaves, worms and chrysalis. It is the spinner's business to straighten out these fibres, with the aid of machinery, and then to so join them that they become a thread, which is known as spun silk.\n\nAll silk produced by the worm is composed of two substances: fibroin, the true thread, and sericin, which is a hard, gummy coating of the fibroin. Before the silk can be manipulated by machinery to any advantage, the gum coating must be removed, really dissolved and washed away. Where the method used in achieving this operation is through fermentation, the product is called schappe. The former, schapping, is the French, Italian and Swiss method, from which the silk when finished is neither so bright nor so good in colour as the discharged silk; but it is very clean and level, and for some purposes essential, as, for instance, in velvet manufacture.\n\n\n"}

Established in 1807 as the College of Medicine of Maryland, it is the first public and the fifth oldest medical school in the United States. It was also the first medical school to institute a residency training program. UMB SOM's campus includes Davidge Hall, which was built in 1812, and is the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIn addition to an degree, the UMB SOM offers PhD programs through the Graduate Program in Life Sciences. It also offers several joint degree programs: a Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) MD/PhD, a joint MD/DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery), the MD/MPH (Master of Public Health) program, and the PhD/DPT (Doctor of Physical Therapy).\n\nThe University of Maryland School of Medicine was ranked 21st in \"U.S. News and World Report\"s 2019 rankings of \"Best Medical Schools: Primary Care\", and 31st in \"Best Medical Schools: Research\". , the school offered admission to 6.8% of applicants. Since 2006, the medical school dean has been E. Albert Reece.\n\nChartered as the College of Medicine of Maryland in December 1807, the University of Maryland School of Medicine was the founding school of the University System of Maryland and the only public medical school in the U.S. at the time. It is the fifth oldest medical school in the country after the medicals schools at Columbia University (established May 1807), Dartmouth College (1798), Harvard University (1782), and the University of Pennsylvania (1765).\n\nIts founding by Nathaniel Potter and John Beale Davidge was part of an influx of professionals to Baltimore and the rapid urban development that immediately followed the American Revolution. By the late 1780s, there was public discussion about the need for \"medical reform and suppression of quackery\". A group of physicians made several short-lived attempts at starting medical schools around the turn of the 19th century, and were finally successful in 1807 when the Maryland state legislature passed the Medical College Bill, authorizing the formation the College of Medicine of Maryland. In 1812 it was rechartered as the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nDavidge Hall, built in 1812 and still in use today, is the original building of the College of Medicine of Maryland. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest building in continuous use for medical education in the United States. In the 1950s, the building was named after John Beale Davidge, one of the founders and the first dean of the College of Medicine of Maryland.\n\nIn a 2011 article in \"Forbes\" magazine, Steven Salzberg criticized the school's inclusion of pseudoscientific subjects such as homeopathy in the curriculum. According to Salzberg, the school is \"mis-training medical students\" by teaching courses in integrative medicine. \n\nResearchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have made several milestone discoveries in the field of biomedical research and therapeutics. Recent discoveries include the development of aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer by the lab of Angela Brodie, and the discovery of calcium sparks as drivers of heart contraction by the lab of Jonathan Lederer. The School of Medicine is a research-focused academic institution, with over $400 million in extramural research funding in 2015. A large portion of that research funding comes from the federal government of the United States. , over $148 million in research grants from the NIH were attributed to the parent university of the School of Medicine. Focus areas of the University of Maryland School of Medicine's research include cancer research, cardiovascular research, neuroscience, and virology.\n\nThe School of Medicine has launched several research centers and institutes dedicated to specific fields of research:\n\nThe Institute of Human Virology (IHV) was formed in 1996 as a research institute of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, headed and co-founded by Robert Gallo, the only recipient of two Lasker Awards for the discovery of the first human retrovirus, and the discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS. IHV operates in a dedicated building on the UMSOM campus next to the University of Maryland Medical Center as a partnership between the State of Maryland, the City of Baltimore, the University System of Maryland and the University of Maryland Medical System.\n\nLaunched in 2007, the Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) is an internationally recognized genomics research center at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. IGS investigators use genomic and bioinformatic tools to research genome function in health and diseases and work in interdisciplinary collaborations with biomedical investigators. IGS is led by Dr. Claire M. Fraser-Liggett. Research areas include: Bioinformatics, Cancer Genomics, Functional Genomics, Human Genetic Variation, Infectious Diseases, Organismal Diversity and Evolution, Human Microbiome Project, Plant Genomics, and Microbial Community Ecology. Investigators at IGS work on Disease Ontology research, the Data Analysis and Coordination Center (DACC) for HMP, and other grants. IGS is one of the Genome Sequencing Center for Infectious Diseases (GSCID) centers designated by NIAID.\n\nThe Institute for Global Health (IGH) was established in 2015 and is dedicated to improving global health by conducting innovative, world-leading research around the world. The IGH develops new and improved ways of diagnosing, preventing, treating, controlling and eradicating diseases of global impact. Such diseases include malaria, Ebola and vaccine-preventable infectious diseases such as measles. The IGH includes the Center for Vaccine Development (CVD) and the Division of Malaria Research.\n\nThe MPRC was established on the grounds of Spring Grove Hospital as a result of public interest in the research pioneered there on the use of the psychedelic compound LSD in Schizophrenia research. The first of this series of experiments, which came to be known as the Spring Grove Experiment, began in 1955 in cottage 13 of the hospital grounds. The study was largely conducted by the members of the Research Unit of Spring Grove State Hospital, and became the largest study on psychedelic drugs in psychiatric research. After the study gained media publicity, research funding was made available and Spring Grove was rebuilt into the MPRC, a division of the department of Psychiatry of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Currently, MPRC hosts over 20 clinical and basic research faculty that form its core research program into psychiatric disease. MPRC is also the editorial seat for the Schizophrenia Bulletin, a peer-reviewed medical journal dedicated to schizophrenia research.\n\n\n\n\n"}
