Established on 13 December 1947, and started in 1949, ATIRA was recognized by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research under the Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India. It was later linked to the Ministry of Textiles.\n\nThe idea of ATIRA was conceived by Vikram Sarabhai, Kasturbhai Lalbhai and Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar. The foundation stone for the ATIRA complex was laid by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 1 November 1950 which was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on completion on 10 April 1954. The architect of the ATIRA building is Achyut Kanvinde. Dr. Vikram Sarabhai served as its first honorary director.\n\nMembership in ATIRA is voluntary. ATIRA has 146 member units in both India and abroad. Of these 93 are Ginning, Spinning, Weaving, Process Houses and Composite Textile Units and 53 are manufacturers of fibres, dyes, chemicals, instruments, equipment and machinery.\n\nATIRA is financed by four sources – Annual Subscription from member units, income from the services it has rendered, sponsored research from the Industry, Ministry of Textiles, Ministry of Information Technology and other agencies like the Gujarat State Government. Grant aid is also provided by the Government of India.\n\nATIRA's governing council consists of 17 members. It consists of 5 elected members from the industry, including the Chairman, 3 nominated members from various departments of Government of India and 3 scientists as designated members.

Educated first at Perth Academy he later moved to Edinburgh continuing his studies at Craigmount School.\n\nIn 1899 Bell married Miss Cammilla Bruce. The ceremony was conducted in her native city of Edinburgh, but with both in their late 30s at the time of the marriage, a life without children seemed probable. It has been speculated that this contributed to his desire to make a lasting mark, leading to his philanthropy.\n\nBell joined the family business as a partner in 1895, following in the path of his father and grandfather. He quickly made his mark, and along with his brother, Robert, succeeded in doubling the company's profits before his father's death in 1900. At this time Bell, as the eldest son, became managing director, and continued to expand the business despite the setbacks of the Great Depression and Prohibition in the United States, becoming governor director in 1921 when the company became a limited company. This expansion was achieved in large part through the use of advertising and agents, many of whom were members of his extended family living throughout the empire, and included the friendly takeover of three distilleries between 1933–1936. By the time of Bell's death in 1942, the company's profits were in excess of £100,000 per annum.\n\nLater in his life, Bell saved the Perth linen industry by financially backing the one remaining company, John Shields and Co. intervening at the request of the Lord Provost Robert Nimmo. The apparent and imminent closure of this company came as a shock to the local council, and the loss of 300 jobs would have been a blow to the city. For his contribution Bell receiving the Freedom of Perth, and the workers of the company presented him with a parchment tribute as a thanks for his part in turning the company into a successful and growing enterprise. Following his purchase of the company, Bell reconstructed the firm and re-equipped it for artificial fibre production, helping to secure the business into the future.\n\nThis quotation from Bell's acceptance of the Freedom of Perth sums up his approach to philanthropy, and how as a beneficiary of the then booming Scotch whisky trade, Bell prospered and was able to look to benefit his home city. His first major project in this direction was the building of the Gannochy Housing Estate between 1924 and 1932. This model housing scheme was intended to benefit the hardworking of a younger generation, who had survived the harshness of war and were now looking to better themselves, with many of the original tenancies being granted to workers of Bell & Sons.\n\nHis next major project was the establishment of the Gannochy Trust in 1937, founded partly to maintain the Gannochy estate and partly to ensure the continuing improvement of his native city into the future, even after his death.\n\nAfter housing, the other major concern for post-war Perth was the supply of clean water, with the River Tay becoming increasingly polluted. In answer to this problem Bell provided shares in Bell's Whisky to the Gannochy Trust for the purpose of establishing Sewage treatment works for Perth and the surrounding villages, having previously commissioned a survey of what needed to be done to improve the situation in 1925. In total the trust was able to provide £640,000 towards the projects, with the one in Perth being completed in 1971.\n\nIn contrast to many of his local contemporaries, such as John Dewar, 1st Baron Forteviot and Robert Pullar, Bell received comparatively few public honours for his philanthropic activities during his life. One distinction he did receive, on 18 March 1938, was the Freedom of Perth, which he described as his greatest honour. This honour was granted primarily for his role in saving John Shields and Co. rather than for any of his philanthropic activities, which appear to have been done quietly and gone without any major public awareness during his life, a fact he would likely have been grateful for.\n\nIn 1994, the decision was taken to name Perth's new multi-million-pound library the A. K. Bell library in honour of the man who had played such a large part in the city's history and whose legacy has had such a large impact on the city. The library officially opened in 1995.\n\nArthur Kinmond Bell died unexpectedly of illness on 26 April 1942. His will, though, proved him to be as generous in death as he was in life, gifting to 3 senior employees of Arthur Bell and Sons the sum of £5000, to all staff with 10 years experience in the company, £500, and to his gardeners, chauffeurs, and servants in his employ for 10 years or more, £200, all significant amounts for those who benefitted.\n\nAt the time of his death Bell was living in Kincarrathie House, Perth, with his wife. Camilla later donated the house to the Kincarrathie Trust, who now run the house as a retirement home.\n\n"}

He was a leading broodmare sire in 1983, 1984, and 1989.\n\nBuckpasser was a bay colt that was bred and owned by Ogden Phipps and foaled at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky. He was by the Horse of the Year-winner Tom Fool, and his dam was the stakes-winning mare Busanda, by the Triple Crown-winner War Admiral. Busanda’s second dam was the Blue Hen broodmare La Troienne (FR). He was a half-brother to several other horses that included the stakes-winners Bupers (won $221,688) and Bureaucracy ($156,635). Buckpasser was inbred in the fourth generation (4m x 4f) to the French racehorse and influential sire Teddy.\n\nRacing official Dr. Manual Gilman said of him, \"Generally, every horse has about a hundred faults of conformation. I would defy anybody to pick a flaw in Buckpasser.\" Renowned horse painter Richard Stone Reeves said, \"Buckpasser was the most perfectly proportioned Thoroughbred I have ever seen.\" Only two horses, Secretariat and Affirmed, have since been \"in a class with Buckpasser\".\n\nBuckpasser had two trainers, both since elected to the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame. Bill Winfrey began his training, and when he retired, Eddie Neloy took over and prepared Buckpasser for his three-year-old season.\n\nBuckpasser's first race start was on May 13, 1965, in which he ran a poor fourth. It was the only time he did not place. When Buckpasser ran in the Flamingo Stakes, the race was declared a nonwagering event, forever after called the \"Chicken\" Flamingo.\n\nAfter his two-year-old season and spring, he was placed at the top of the Experimental Free Handicap with 126 pounds. Buckpasser developed a quarter crack that kept him out of the 1966 Kentucky Derby, as well as the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. It took almost three months for the crack to heal.\n\nIn Chicago's Arlington Classic, Kauai King ran against the strenuous protests of his trainer. He broke down and was retired, while Buckpasser won the race, setting a new world record for a mile with a time of 1:32 3/5. This record stood for two years until Dr. Fager broke it in 1968, running 1:32 1/5. In 1989, Buckpasser's grandson, Hall of Fame Champion Easy Goer, ran a mile in 1:32 2/5.\n\nBuckpasser won 15 consecutive races that included the American Derby (breaking the track record), the Chicago Stakes, the Brooklyn Derby, the Woodward Stakes, the Travers Stakes, the Malibu Stakes, the Brooklyn Handicap, the Lawrence Realization Stakes, and the two-mile-long Jockey Club Gold Cup. With 13 victories as a three-year-old, Buckpasser became the first horse to earn more than $1 million before the age of four. He was named the 1966 American Horse of the Year.\n\nHis four-year-old season commenced with a win in the San Fernando Stakes. Another quarter crack developed in Buckpasser’s off (right) fore hoof, and he did not race for 4½ months. When he returned, he scored his 15th consecutive victory in the Metropolitan Mile. On June 17, 1967, Buckpasser's winning streak ended with his first and only attempt at racing on grass. He finished third to stablemate Poker in the Bowling Green Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack. Assagai, the 1966 turf-course champion, finished second. As \"The Blood-Horse\" said in its July 24, 1967, issue: \"Never had so many people had so many immunization shots in order to stay home and watch the Suburban Handicap on Independence Day.\" Three reasons were advanced for his defeat: turf, shoes, and weight. Buckpasser also ran that day with his head held in an uncommon way, slightly sideways. No one has ever understood why.\n\nHe won 25 of his 31 races, including a 15-race winning streak, earned five Eclipse Awards between 1965 and 1967, and was inducted to the Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nWhen he retired, Buckpasser was syndicated for $4,800,000: a record $150,000 a share. He stood at stud at the farm where he was born. In 11 years, he sired 313 foals, of which 35 won stakes races. \nIncluded in his get were: \n\nThough he had three tail-male Kentucky Derby (G1) winners (Spend a Buck-1985, Lil E. Tee-1992 and Silver Charm-1997), his record as a damsire stands out.\n\nBuckpasser was a leading broodmare sire in 1983, 1984, and 1989.

{"id": "3387471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3387471", "title": "Capacity utilization", "text": "Capacity utilization\n\nCapacity utilization or capacity utilisation is the extent to which an enterprise or a nation uses its installed productive capacity. It is the relationship between output that \"is\" produced with the installed equipment, and the potential output which \"could\" be produced with it, if capacity was fully used.\n\nOne of the most used definitions of the \"capacity utilization rate\" is the ratio of actual output to the potential output. But potential output can be defined in at least two different ways.\n\nOne is the \"engineering\" or \"technical\" definition, according to which potential output represents the maximum amount of output that can be produced in the short-run with the existent stock of capital. Thus, a standard definition of capacity utilization is the (weighted) average of the ratios between the actual output of firms to the maximum that could be produced per unit of time, with existing plant and equipment (see Johanson 1968). Obviously, \"output\" could be measured in physical units or in market values, but normally it is measured in market values.\n\nHowever, as output increases and well before the absolute physical limit of production is reached, most firms might well experience an increase in the average cost of production—even if there is no change in the level of plant & equipment used. For example, higher average costs can arise, because of the need to operate extra shifts, to undertake additional plant maintenance, and so on.\n\nAn alternative approach, sometimes called the \"economic\" utilization rate, is, therefore, to measure the ratio of actual output to the level of output \"beyond which the average cost of production begins to rise\". In this case, surveyed firms are asked by how much it would be practicable for them to raise production from existing plant and equipment, \"without raising unit costs\" (see Berndt & Morrison 1981). Typically, this measure will yield a rate around 10 percentage points higher than the \"engineering\" measure, but time series show the same movement over time.\n\nIn economic statistics, capacity utilization is normally surveyed for goods-producing industries at plant level. The results are presented as an average percentage rate by industry and economy-wide, where 100% denotes full capacity. This rate is also sometimes called the \"operating rate\". If the operating rate is high, this is called \"full capacity\", while if the operating rate is low, a situation of \"excess capacity\" or \"surplus capacity\" exists. The observed rates are often turned into indices. Capacity utilization is much more difficult to measure for service industries.\n\nThere has been some debate among economists about the validity of statistical measures of capacity utilization, because much depends on the survey questions asked, and on the valuation principles used to measure output. Also, the efficiency of production may change over time, due to new technologies.\n\nFor example, Michael Perelman has argued in his 1989 book \"Keynes, Investment Theory and the Economic Slowdown: The Role of Replacement Investment and q-Ratios\" that the US Federal Reserve Board measure is just not very revealing. Prior to the early 1980s, he argues, American business carried a great deal of extra capacity. At that time, running close to 80% would indicate that a plant was approaching capacity restraints. Since that time, however, firms scrapped much of their most inefficient capacity. As a result, a modern 77% capacity utilization now would be equivalent to a historical level of 70%.\n\nIf market demand grows, capacity utilization will rise. If demand weakens, capacity utilization will slacken. Economists and bankers often watch capacity utilization indicators for signs of inflation pressures.\n\nIt is often believed that when the utilization rate rises above somewhere between 82% and 85%, price inflation will increase. Excess capacity means that insufficient demand exists to warrant expansion of output. \n\nAll else constant, the lower capacity utilization falls (relative to the trend capacity utilization rate), the better the bond market likes it. Bondholders view strong capacity utilization (above the trend rate) as a leading indicator of higher inflation. Higher inflation—or the expectation of higher inflation—decreases bond prices, often prompting a higher yield to compensate for the higher expected rate of inflation.\n\nImplicitly, the capacity utilization rate is also an indicator of how efficiently the factors of production are being used. Much statistical and anecdotal evidence shows that many industries in the developed capitalist economies suffer from \"chronic\" excess capacity. Critics of market capitalism, therefore, argue the system is not as efficient as it may seem, since at least 1/5 more output could be produced and sold, if buying power was better distributed. However, a level of utilization somewhat below the maximum typically prevails, regardless of economic conditions.\n\nThe notion of capacity utilization was introduced into modern business cycle theory by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988). They illustrated how capacity utilization is important for getting business cycle correlations in economic models to match the data when there are shocks to investment spending.\n\nAs a derivative indicator, the \"output gap percentage\" (%OG) can be measured as the gap between actual output (AO) and potential output (PO) \"divided\" by potential output and \"multiplied\" by 100%:\n\nIn the survey of plant capacity used by the US Federal Reserve Board for the FRB capacity utilization index, firms are asked about \"the maximum level of production that this establishment could reasonably expect to attain under normal and realistic operating conditions, fully utilizing the machinery and equipment in place.\" \n\nBy contrast, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) index asks respondents to measure their current output relative to \"normal capacity\", and this yields a utilization rate, which is between 4 and 10 percentage points higher than the FRB measure. Again, the time series show more or less the same historical movement.\n\nSee: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System: Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization \n\nThe average economy-wide capacity utilization rate in the US since 1967 was about 81.6%, according to the Federal Reserve measure. The figure for Europe is not much different, for Japan being only slightly higher.\n\nThe average utilization rate of installed productive capacity in industry, in some major areas of the world, was estimated in 2003/2004 to be as follows (rounded figures):\n\n\n\n"}

EQUASS aims to enhance the social sector by engaging service providers in quality and continuous improvement and by guaranteeing service users quality of services throughout Europe.\n\nEQUASS, formerly called the European Quality in Rehabilitation Mark (EQRM) is an initiative of the European Platform for Rehabilitation (EPR) and its secretariat is based in Brussels.\n\nIn July 1995, the European Platform for Rehabilitation, then called the European Platform for Vocational Rehabilitation (EPVR), tasked its working group \"Quality management and cost effectiveness\" to study the launch of a \"Quality Award for Vocational Rehabilitation\" for European institutes of vocational rehabilitation. \nThe award would require an audit which, if successful, would show that the institute of vocational rehabilitation works in accordance with the standards of the platform. \nThe certification system to be launched was mainly inspired by the CARF certification.\nThe European Platform for Rehabilitation enrolled a few of its members to implement the quality standard that was then named EQRM (European Quality in Rehabilitation Mark). The first awarding event took place in Rome in December 2003.\nThe main values behind the quality mark were: \n\nIn 2008, the European Platform for Rehabilitation decided to create an additional quality assurance mark (EQUASS Assurance), alongside its EQRM mark (now renamed EQUASS Excellence).\nIn December 2008 the European Platform for Rehabilitation launched a two-year project, partially funded by the Progress programme of the European Commission. The aim of the project was to develop, with the collaboration of the major European stakeholders in social services, a European Quality Framework for Social Services of General interest (SSGI). The Framework would include quality principles and criteria for quality assurance validated for the whole sector, and operational performance indicators for measuring and benchmarking performance on the quality criteria in social services.\nIn 2010, the platform launched the results of the Common Quality Framework for SSGI, including the certification of a few pilot sites in charge of testing the new quality system in various types of social services.\nIn January 2012, EQUASS deployed its new quality standard, now available for all social service providers in Europe, and no longer limited to rehabilitation providers and other disability services providers. The new quality standard was then based on the results of the Common Quality Framework for SSGI, but also other quality standards, listed below.\n\nSocial services providers that meet the certification requirements for European Quality in Social Services have demonstrated their compliance with the following requirements:\n\n- The Voluntary European Quality Framework for Social Services which was adopted by the Social Protection Committee in October 2010.\n\n- The Common Quality Framework for Social Services of General Interest (December 2010) in which 50 major stakeholders from various social services sectors agreed on the different components and pre-conditions of quality.\n\n- Vocational Education and Training institutions that fulfil the criteria for EQUASS also comply with the European Quality Assurance Reference Framework for VET which was adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council on 18 June 2009.\n\n- The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (December 2006).\n\nEQUASS is built on ten quality principles that reflect the wishes of its European stakeholders (funders, social partners, client representatives and advocacy groups), balancing business efficiency requirements, with a strong focus on protecting the rights of the clients, and a person-centred approach, while ensuring a professional development and training of the staff.\n\nEQUASS certification offers a formal recognition of meeting the European quality requirements. EQUASS Assurance and EQUASS Excellence are based on the same Principles for Quality, with EQUASS Assurance being a stepping stone towards achieving the EQUASS Excellence level.\n\nEQUASS Assurance guarantees quality of service provision by certifying compliance with 50 criteria based on the ten Principles for Quality. It can be viewed as a fundamental requirement for operating social services, having a feasible threshold in terms of costs, efforts and resources required. An organisation that meets the EQUASS Assurance criteria is certified for a two-year period.\n\nEQUASS Excellence is awarded to service providers that can demonstrate achievements and continuous improvement on all 50 criteria based on the ten Principles for Quality from three different perspectives: approach, deployment and results. An organisation that meets the EQUASS Excellence criteria is certified for a three-year period.\n\nEQUASS is supervised and supported by a network of external and internal stakeholders. The EQUASS Awarding Committee comprises key European actors in social services and EU politics.\n\nAll awarding processes are supervised by the European Awarding Committee. The Committee includes many of the key European stakeholders in the sector such as service users, social partners, service providers, policy makers and funders:\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nBusiness Disability Forum (former Employers’ Forum on Disability)\n\nEuropean Association of Service Providers for People with Disabilities\n\nEuropean Disability Forum\n\nEuropean Network of Social Authorities\n\nEuropean Platform for Rehabilitation\n\nEuropean Social Insurance Platform\n\nEuropean Federation of Older People\n\nRehabilitation International - Europe\n\n, there are 440 certified organisations in 11 European countries, serving over 100.000 users, and employing over 14.000 staff members.\n\nThe areas in which the certified organisations are active include, among others:\n\nIn Norway, EQUASS Assurance certification is one of several quality labels that allow a disability service provider or social firm to get funding from the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) in exchange for providing rehabilitation services. As a result of that endorsement, about 75% of the EQUASS Assurance certified organisations are located in Norway (as of 2013).\n\nIn Portugal and Estonia, the European Social Fund has supported the capacity building of its social services providers by funding EQUASS applications and supporting the costs of the implementation of a new quality system.\n\nIn Greece, a research paper published in 2013 in the Disability and Health Journal found that \"[The] EQUASS initiative, developed according to European standards and implemented in resource-limited settings, was recognized as the most adaptive and appropriate system for Greek rehabilitation settings\". The articles further claims that the \"EQUASS initiative emerged as the most appropriate for implementation in the Greek health care setting, since it addresses a large number of existing problems, [...] and has already been partially applied in the Greek welfare sector.\"\n\n"}

He was the son of Sydney Smith Lee, a captain in the Confederate States Navy, and the nephew of General Robert E. Lee.\n\nLee was born at Clermont in Fairfax County, Virginia. He was the grandson of \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee, a nephew of Robert E. Lee and Samuel Cooper, and cousin of George Washington Custis Lee, W.H.F. \"Rooney\" Lee, and Robert E. Lee, Jr. His father, Sydney Smith Lee, served under Commodore Perry in Japanese waters and rose to the rank of Captain; his mother, Anna Maria Mason Lee, was a granddaughter of George Mason and the sister of James Murray Mason.\n\nGraduating from the United States Military Academy in 1856, Lee was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (later redesignated the 5th Cavalry Regiment), which was commanded by Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston, and in which his uncle, Robert E. Lee, was lieutenant colonel. As a cavalry subaltern, he distinguished himself by his gallant conduct in actions against the Comanches in Texas, and was severely wounded in a fight in Nescutunga, Texas, in 1859. \nIn May 1860, he was appointed instructor of cavalry tactics at West Point, but resigned his commission upon the secession of Virginia.\n\nLee joined the Confederate States Army as a lieutenant of cavalry and served at first as a staff officer to Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell at the First Battle of Bull Run. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 1st Virginia Cavalry in September 1861, serving under Colonel J.E.B. Stuart. Lee became colonel of the regiment in March 1862 and was promoted to brigadier general on July 24, 1862. During the Northern Virginia Campaign, Lee received notoriety by arriving late for a concentration of cavalry, which allowed Federal cavalry to raid Stuart's headquarters and capture his famous plumed hat and cape. However, during the subsequent Confederate raid on Catlett's Station, he captured the headquarters tent and dress uniform of Union Maj. Gen. John Pope. Lee gave Pope's coat to Stuart as compensation for the hat he had lost.\n\nLee performed well in the Maryland Campaign of 1862, covering the Confederate infantry's withdrawal from South Mountain, delaying the Union Army advance to Sharpsburg, Maryland, before the Battle of Antietam, and covering his army's recrossing of the Potomac River into Virginia. Stuart's cavalry made its second ride around the Union Army in the Chambersburg Raid before returning in time to screen Robert E. Lee's movement towards Fredericksburg where the cavalry defended the extreme right of the Confederate line. Fitzhugh Lee conducted the cavalry action of Kelly's Ford (March 17, 1863) with skill and success, where his 400 troopers captured 150 men and horses with a loss of only 14 men. In the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Lee's reconnaissance found that the Union Army's right flank was \"in the air\", which allowed the successful flanking attack by Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, a movement led by Lee's cavalry.\n\nAfter Chancellorsville, Lee was incapacitated by inflammatory rheumatism, missing a month of action, which included the significant cavalry operations at the Battle of Brandy Station. He recovered in time to lead a brigade in Jeb Stuart's third ride around the Union Army, in the early days of the Gettysburg Campaign, with his most significant contribution being at the Battle of Carlisle. During the Battle of Gettysburg, his brigade fought unsuccessfully in the action at East Cavalry Field. Stuart's report singled out no officer in his command for praise except Fitz Lee, who he said was \"one of the finest cavalry leaders on the continent, and richly [entitled] to promotion.\" During the withdrawal from Gettysburg, Lee's brigade held the fords at Shepherdstown to prevent the Union army from following across the Potomac River. Lee was promoted to major general on August 3, 1863, and continued to serve under Maj. Gen. Stuart's command, despite Stuart not receiving promotion following his questionable conduct in the Gettysburg Campaign. While his uncle maneuvered the Army of Northern Virginia back into central Virginia, Lee's division launched a successful ambush on Union cavalry at the Battle of Buckland Mills that fall.\n\nIn the Overland Campaign the following spring, Lee was constantly employed as a divisional commander under Stuart. Following the Battle of the Wilderness, Lee's cavalry division played a pivotal role in impeding the Union Army in its race to the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. During the fighting at Spotsylvania, Gen. Stuart was detached from the army for the purpose of thwarting Union cavalry commander Phillip Sheridan's raid on Richmond. Stuart took Fitzhugh Lee's division with him. The mission ultimately ended in the mortal wounding of Gen. Stuart at the Battle of Yellow Tavern and Lee's inability to break through United States Colored Troops defense of Fort Pocohontas in Charles City County. After Stuart's death, Lee served under Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton. Hampton, who had been Lee's peer for much of the war, was promoted to replace Stuart due to his seniority and greater level of experience; some observers at the time had cynically expected Robert E. Lee's nephew to receive the command.\n\nAt the Battle of Trevillian Station, Hampton's cavalry prevented Gen. Sheridan's cavalry from aiding General David Hunter's force in western Virginia, where it was certain to have inflicted great damage on General Robert E. Lee's supply and communication lines. The battle also served to screen Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early's move from Richmond to aid Lynchburg, which Hunter was set to besiege. Hampton's cavalry corps shadowed Sheridan's return to Petersburg.\n\nLee subsequently joined Early for his campaign against Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley, and at Third Winchester (September 19, 1864) three horses were shot under him and he was severely wounded. When General Hampton was sent to assist General Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina, the command of the whole of Robert E. Lee's cavalry devolved upon Fitzhugh Lee on March 29, 1865, but the surrender at Appomattox followed quickly upon the opening of the campaign. Fitzhugh Lee himself led the last charge of the Confederates on April 9 that year at Farmville, Virginia.\n\nAfter the war, Lee devoted himself to farming in Stafford County, Virginia, and was conspicuous in his efforts to reconcile the Southern people to the issue of the war, which he regarded as a final settlement of the questions at issue. In 1875, he attended the Battle of Bunker Hill centennial at Boston and delivered a remarkable address. In 1885, he was a member of the board of visitors of West Point, and from 1886 to 1890 was governor of Virginia having defeated in 1885 Republican John Sergeant Wise with 52.77% of the vote.\n\nLee commanded the third division at both of President Grover Cleveland's inaugural parades in 1885 and 1893.\n\nIn April 1896, Lee was appointed consul-general at Havana by President Cleveland, with duties of a diplomatic and military character added to the usual consular business. In this post (in which he was retained by President William McKinley until 1898) he was from the first called upon to deal with a situation of great difficulty, which culminated with the destruction of the warship . Upon the declaration of war between Spain and the United States, he re-entered the army.\n\nHe was one of four ex-Confederate general officers who were made major generals of United States Volunteers (the others being Matthew Butler, Joseph Wheeler and Thomas L. Rosser). Fitzhugh Lee commanded the 7th Army Corps, but took no part in the actual operations in Cuba. He was military governor of Havana and Pinar del Río in 1899, subsequently commanded the Department of the Missouri, and retired in 1901 as a brigadier general, U.S. Army.\n\nLee was an early leader of the committee for the Jamestown Exposition, which would be held after his death at Sewell's Point on Hampton Roads in 1907. Lee died in Washington, D.C., and is buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia.\n\nLee wrote the article about Robert E. Lee in the \"Great Commanders\" series (1894), \"General Lee\", a wartime biography (1894), and \"Cuba's Struggle Against Spain\" (1899).\n\n\n\n"}

As of 2015, HVS operated out of 35 offices located in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and the Mid-East. In addition to its original offerings of consulting and valuation services for the lodging industry, HVS today provides multiple hospitality services and specializations in areas such as executive recruitment, investment banking, hotel management, hotel asset management, operational and marketing consulting, litigation support, golf facilities, court appointed receivership services, convention centers, and sports, convention and entertainment facilities consulting. The privately held firm performs approximately 5,000 assignments throughout the world for hotel owners, operators, lenders and various institutions each year.\n\nOriginally known as Hospitality Valuation Services, the company was founded by Steve Rushmore in 1980 in a one-room office in Garden City, New York. Rushmore, a graduate of the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, drew upon his experience as head of the hospitality consulting division of Helmsley-Spear, a position he took on in 1971. At that time, there were valuation companies specializing in appraising real estate (but not hotel operations) and accounting firms knowledgeable in hotel operations (but not real estate). Recognizing the need for an appraisal company that specialized in the hospitality arena, Rushmore pursued membership in the Appraisal Institute (then known as the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers). When he received the MAI designation from the Institute in 1976, Rushmore enjoyed the distinction of being the Institute's only member with a degree in hotel administration.\n\nCombining his Appraisal Institute membership with his hotel school degree from Cornell, Rushmore then wrote an appraisal textbook for the hospitality industry, \"The Valuation of Hotels and Motels\", which the Institute published in 1978. The text has been updated four times, and the most recent publication is \"Hotels & Motels: Valuations and Market Studies\". This publication has been described as \"the seminal text on the art and science of hotel appraisals\". This, and other publications by Rushmore, established the methodology for appraising hotels that is today considered an industry standard.\n\nCapitalizing on its singular status as the only consulting and valuation company dedicated solely to the hospitality industry, HVS expanded, opening a West Coast office in San Francisco five years later, followed by offices in London, Colorado, and Florida. Today, the company has a presence in nearly thirty-five cities on five continents.\n\nThe organizational structure and operations of HVS are modeled on that of other consulting firms, such as McKinsey & Company, particularly with regards to the company's recruitment of hospitality students from prestigious universities and its compensation structure. Although the learning curve is steep, those who thrive in the company's entrepreneurial environment have the opportunity to transfer to other offices in a different part of the globe. In a May 2010 cover story about HVS, \"Lodging Hospitality\" magazine opined, \"The list of alumni reads like a who's who of the most highly regarded consultants, development executives and financial experts in the worldwide lodging industry.\"\n\nTo help market its hotel consulting and valuation services, HVS began disseminating a broad spectrum of complimentary information to the lodging industry. HVS encouraged its associates to publish articles on informative, timely, and interesting topics for the lodging industry, and the research and writings of HVS associates are published and cited in a number of academic journals.\n\nHVS conducts seminars on hotel valuation for the Appraisal Institute and other organizations around the world and has trained more than 20,000 appraisers and industry professionals. HVS research and data-gathering about historical and projected hotel value trends, sales transaction data, compensation programs, franchise fees, hotel franchise development costs, and hotel renovation costs provides data to industry participants.\n\nConsistent with the academic background of the company's founder, HVS supports several institutions of higher learning that specialize in hospitality. To foster academic research in the field, HVS endows professorial chairs at both New York University's Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management and Cornell University's hotel school. HVS also funded Cornell University's Rushmore–Jennings Computer Library and is a corporate partner in the university's Center for Hospitality Research.\n\nEach year, HVS plays a significant role in New York University's International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, where the company presents its annual report on Hotel Valuation and Transaction Trends for the U.S. Lodging Industry to conference attendees. An HVS executive serves as the conference coordinator, and others associated with the company serve as panel moderators and speakers.

It focused on the conditions of children in Africa, specifically in the areas of infant mortality, child labour and education. \n\nThe conference met in Geneva in the summer of 1931, between 22 and 25 June. It is considered a turning point in western attitudes to childhood in Africa: \"this conference reconstructed the images of childhood in Africa among missionaries, child welfare humanitarians and social scientists\". There were only five Africans among the participants, although even this level of participation was unusual at the time. One of these was Jomo Kenyatta of the Kikuyu Central Association. Kenyatta wrote about the conference later, on the subject of circumcision and female genital mutilation, which he defended as a cultural practice among the Kikuyu:\n\n\"In this conference several European delegates urged that the time was ripe when this \"barbarous custom\" should be abolished, and that, like all other \"heathen\" customs, it should be abolished at once by law.\"\n\nOther African representatives were teacher and writer Gladys Casely-Hayford, daughter of the Ghanaian politician J. E. Casely Hayford, and Nigerian educator Henry Carr. Another black speaker was the American activist James W. Ford of the League Against Imperialism, who gave a speech criticising the conference for merely supporting the colonial order.\n\nThe conference secretary was writer Evelyn Sharp, who wrote a book about it called \"The African Child\". Another contributor was a missionary, Dora Earthy.\n\n\n"}

He is known mostly as the moving spirit behind turning a fishing bay in Burriana into a modern port, facilitating export of oranges grown in the area. As a politician he is recognized as representative of large proprietors within the Carlist movement.\n\nJaime Chicharro Sánchez-Guió was born to a family of Castilian landowners. His paternal ancestors originated from Vascongadas; his grandfather, Jesús Chicharro de la Torre, was a military engineer and settled in the province of Ciudad Real following railway construction works. Jaime’s father, José Chicharro Martín del Moral (1856-1905), sided with the legitimists during the Third Carlist War. He married Soledad Sánchez-Guió Ruiz-Hidalgo (1860-1912). The couple had 4 children, apart from Jaime also three daughters, all raised in a fervently Catholic ambience.\n\nIn 1897 the young Jaime entered the Jesuit Colegio Nuestra Señora del Recuerdo in the Madrid district of Chamartín de la Rosa. Having completed secondary education he moved to Biscay commencing law studies in the Jesuit Deusto College. Following graduation he completed his education obtaining diploma in Philosophy and Letters from the (later Universidad Complutense) in Madrid. Holding two diplomas he settled in Madrid and assumed the chair of History in same Jesuit college he had attended earlier.\n\nIn 1912 Chicharro married Dolores Lamamié de Clairac Romero y Bermúdez de Castro (1890-1974), sister of the Salamanca landowner and later a well-known Carlist politician, José María Lamamié de Clairac y de la Colina. As she inherited some 300 hectares around Villarreal and Nules, the family moved to the spouse's La Salmantina estate, now located in the municipality of Les Alqueries (Castellón province). The couple had 13 children, born between 1914 and 1932. During early months of the Civil War the oldest daughter was tortured and killed by the Republican militia in Madrid. Five sons volunteered to the Carlist Requeté; one of them died in 1939 due to tortures suffered as the Republican POW. Four sons joined División Azul; two of them died in combat in Russia, the two who survived grew to Francoist generals. His second youngest son served as a diplomat and subgobernador in the Spanish Equatorial Guinea. The youngest son became sort of celebrity as a wrestling champion in the 1950s. Some of Jaime's grandchildren became public figures and stirred political controversy as late as in 2013.\n\nChicharro inherited his militant ultraconservative outlook after his father, who following the Carlist war service contributed belligerent pieces to the Carlist Ciudad Real based \"El Manchego\" weekly in the 1880s. The leaning was further reinforced when during his Madrid academic years Chicharro met and got fascinated by Juan Vázquez de Mella, the top Carlist theorist. In 1909 he co-founded the local Centro Tradicionalista and together with other young Carlists he set up \"El Combate\", a review later renamed to \"Juventud Tradicionalista\". Active in Catholic organizations, he started to appear on public meetings, like those confronting the idea of secular education. In 1911 he engaged in launching Congreso Eucaristico and later joined . Also in 1911 Chicharro joined the Madrid Junta Católica, part of a national electoral effort engineered by the Church and intended to produce a grand Catholic political alliance. At that time he was already a Carlist activist recognized nationally.\n\nWhen following his marriage Chicharro moved to Castellón province he remained in the same political ambience, becoming president of the local Juventud Jaimista and in 1915 growing to jefe of the Villareal Jaimistas. In 1916 he entered the Castellón Junta Provincial and became its vice-president, going on with his Villarreal jefatura duties. The same year for the first time he launched his bid for the Cortes standing in the Nules district. At that time Valencian Carlism was divided between the mainstream purs and the dissident paquistes, followers of Francisco Giner Lila; Chicharro seemed to have allied with none and unsuccessfully ran a broad conservative ticket, forming part of the contenders loyal to the Murcian party leader, Juan de la Cierva y Peñafiel.\n\nHe tried his luck again in Nules in the subsequent campaign of 1918, though political configuration of the time seems particularly obscure and illegible. According to some, he represented the purs faction and was supported by a partially controlled newspaper, \"La Gaceta de Levante\", opposed by the competing paquistes fraction and the conservative mauristas. According to another scholar, Chicharro was criticized by orthodox Carlists for his strong predilection for broad Right-wing alliances, blurring the Traditionalist political identity. He lost again, failing to get the ticket also in by-elections staged later that year as the victorious candidate died soon after having been elected.\n\nIn the 1910s Carlism was increasingly divided between its top theorist Juan Vazquez de Mella and the claimant, Jaime III; the former tended to downplay dynastical issues for the sake of advancing a grand Right-wing formation, united by Traditionalist values. Chicharro sympathised with his former Madrid master and emerged as one of the most vehement Mella supporters; when in 1919 the crisis exploded and the Carlists were forced to take sides, he left the claimant and joined the rebels. In the 1919 electoral campaign he already represented a broad and somewhat vague conservative platform, advocating a broad Catholic national party of the Right. Some sources claim he counted among governmental maurista candidates, some present him as a catholic-monarchist, a ciervista or a Carlist. Finally successful, when in the Cortes he sided with the ciervistas. In 1920 re-election campaign Chicharro had the loyal Carlists pitted against him, but he managed to renew his ticket and served in the diet until 1923.\n\nIn the parliament, at that time dominated by the Conservatives of Eduardo Dato, Chicharro remained a rather restless and turbulent deputy, occasionally sliding to opposition. Apart from the customary anti-liberal diatribes, he was particularly vocal on financial issues, entering into taxation and budgetary disputes with the Minister of Economy. His most lasting achievement is a Royal Order, which marked significant state resources for development of the local Burriana harbor. The design, apart from massive upgrade of the facilities, envisaged also major investments which connected the port with the national railroad network. The work was carried out until the early 1930s and transformed what used to be chiefly a simple fishing bay into a small but modern commercial transport hub. Key beneficiaries of the project were the local Levantine landowners, who gained a gateway for the export of their orange production; Chicharro kept lobbying for their cause in Madrid also during the decades to come. In recognition of his merits, the city of Burriana named Chicharro its hijo adoptivo; upon his return from Madrid he was greeted with arches of triumph and venerating celebrations.\n\nThough initially one of the most outspoken de Mella supporters, Chicharro did not integrate fully in the Mellista group; some speak even of “chicharrismo”, others dubbed him “mauro-ciervista”. While de Mella was firm on his Traditionalist principles and opted for a grand conservative party built upon them, Chicharro started to lean towards the vision of Victor Pradera, embracing a more loose Right-wing alliance held together by a lowest common denominator. In the early 1920s he effectively left the Mellistas; some scholars consider him paradigmatic for many rebellious Carlists who joined de Mella in 1919, but soon abandoned him to pursue their own goals and to amalgamate in other Right-wing groupings.\n\nDuring electoral campaign of 1923 Chicharro was considered a favourite. It is not clear to what extent he ruined his chances himself: during one of electoral meetings in the very city of Burriana he was challenged by a local workers’ leader. Chicharro resolved to a stick and engaged in a brawl, resulting in his victim treated in hospital for head wounds and an administrative action taken against the assailant. \"Diario de Castellón\", the newspaper he founded and owned, failed to mobilize enough support and produced merely significant financial losses. Eventually Chicharro and an albista counter-candidate recorded almost the same score; the latter was declared victorious following behind-the-scene dealings.\n\nIn 1924 Chicharro was active setting up the local Castellon branch of Union Patriotica and soon became its provincial jefe. In the new partido unico he championed the Catholic-based branch and got increasingly alienated by what he perceived as marginalization of the Catholic groupings; other local upetistas accused him of building the local structures chiefly around his former Traditionalist supporters. The conflict climaxed in 1925, when Chicharro in protest resigned from the provincial presidency.\n\nIn 1925 the Chicharros left Levante and moved to Madrid; it is not clear whether the change was anyhow related to political tension or was rather due to financial issues, as reported by some sources; In the capital he started to practice as a lawyer and apparently became fairly successful, as in the early 1930s he grew to member of Junta de Gobierno of the Madrid Congregacion de los Abogados.\n\nIn 1927 Chicharro commenced his career as municipal official, appointed one of 64 new councilors of the Madrid ayuntamiento. In 1928 he grew to teniente de alcalde responsible for the Chamberí district; appointed member of Junta municipal de Primera enseñanza he specialized in education issues, dealing also with culture and science. Chicharro resumed contacts with Vázquez de Mella; only weeks after his death, in March 1928, he arranged for a commemorative plaque to be mounted on the Escuela Normal de Maestros wall and looked after his library. In 1930 the press already referred to him as former , but it is not clear when he ceased.\n\nDuring the last years of the monarchy Chicharro seemed politically disoriented. Though in the press plebiscite he was voted one of three best possible representatives of Castellon province in , he was not appointed its member. He remained active in Catholic groupings like Acción social, giving lectures and contributing as organizer and manager. As friend of Lamamié he maintained links with his Acción Castellana, set up in 1930, and was drawn closer to another of his organizations, Federación Católico-Agraria Salmantina. He remained in the circle of Francesc Cambó, leader of the Catalan conservative Lliga Regionalista. Last but not least, he retained his Carlist contacts with the former mellistas, now headed by the new leader, Victor Pradera.\n\nDuring the local elections of April 1931 Chicharro was overwhelmed by the republican tide and as an independent conservative candidate he failed to get voted into the Madrid ayuntamiento. After proclamation of the Republic he decided to take part in the June 1931 elections to the Cortes from Castellón, still supported by \"Diario de Castellón\", officially the voice of Federación Castellonense de Sindicatos Agrícolas. Chicharro was invited to join the Republicans; according to one source he boldly refused, but according to the press he was running as \"derecha republicana\". The result was rather poor – some call it humiliating - since he arrived 11th with some 11 thousand votes out of 96,000 cast in the province.\n\nIn late 1931 Chicharro started to attend Traditionalist meetings, gradually re-joining followers of the Carlist king and entering their new organization, . Though not counting among national leaders, in the press he emerged as one of the most-quoted Carlist speakers of the first half of 1932, extremely active touring the country and delivering public addresses. In January 1932 he already gave lecture about collaboration and Carlism; in February he presented a broad foreign policy program including control of Gibraltar, federation with Portugal and confederation with Latin American states, in March he labeled the proposed universal suffrage as unjust and lambasted the Republican government for overspending and highly inflated budget. The same month he triggered riots in Soria by proclaiming that he had no intention of surrendering an iota of his wealth without a fight. In April he got his car stolen from the Madrid street. A number of meetings with him taking part were suspended when already ongoing for fear of unrest. Late 1932 he started to write first-page newspaper pieces himself. \n\nIn 1932 Chicharro got engaged in conspiracy of José Sanjurjo, though no details are known. Following the disastrously failed coup he was identified as one of the culprits and became subject of the expropriation, designed to boost the floundering Agrarian Reform. Later that year two of his sons were detained and administrated exile in the Spanish Sahara outpost of Villa Cisneros, which would soon turn into the Carlist hotbed. Continuing with his tours across the country later in 1933 he defended some of the Sanjuriada conspirators in court, though he was himself closely watched by the security and in May he faced trial for inflammatory speak.\n\nIn 1933 Chicharro was active mixing with the Alfonsist monarchists in the Tradicionalistas y Renovación Española alliance; by the local Castellon Liaison Committee he was agreed to represent it in the forthcoming elections. This gained him hostility among new radical Carlist activists like Jaime del Burgo, who despised fraternization with caciques and debris of the Alfonsine monarchy. Moreover, for the Carlist youth the landowners like Lamamié and Chicharro became marked men as privileged section of politically dominant potentates, who are \"obstructing the Agrarian Reform by the feudal egoism of the odious grandees of grain\". Though indeed within Carlism Chicharro formed the most reactionary faction, conservatism did not render him averse to new radical social movements. Discussing Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler he declared that Traditionalism, “though not one and the same thing, is very sympathetic towards them, as they are waging war against Judaism, freemasonry and Marxism, building an organized corporative state. What is inacceptable to us is the state's overwhelming sovereignty and dominance. For us the family comes first, followed by municipality, region and state, which is the last element in this chain”.\n\nRiding the wave of soaring rightist sympathies, in 1933 Chicharro was elected to the Madrid ayuntamiento from the Chamberí district. However, running on the Carlist ticket to the Cortes from Castellón he narrowly lost, though initially he was reported by the press as victorious and his fellow Traditionalist Juan Granell Pascual was indeed elected. At that time he was already seriously ill. Having been generally of rather poor health, as a chain-smoker Chicharro developed grave respiratory problems. Though as late as 1932 he was still hailed by the press as “ilustrado joven”, in August 1933 he was placed in the tuberculosis-treatment Real Sanatorio de Guadarrama, where he died early 1934. His funeral and related commemorative homage feasts staged across Spain helped to mobilize support and demonstrated growing dynamics of Carlism. As the widow and 13 half-orphaned children were in financial dire straits, Comunión Tradicionalista launched a public fund-raising campaign intended to assist them.\n\n\n\n"}

From 2001 to 2008 he served as a senator in the Hamburg state government. Since 2008 he has been a member of the Bertelsmann Stiftung Executive Board where he is responsible for the areas of education and integration. He is considered a leading education expert and is the author of numerous books on education policy, including the impacts of digitization.\n\nDräger completed his secondary education (Abitur) in 1987 at the Christianeum in Hamburg before doing community service in lieu of military service (Zivildienst). He then attended the University of Hamburg, studying physics with a minor in business. After receiving his undergraduate degree (Vordiplom) he transferred to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he was awarded a Master of Science in theoretical physics in 1993. Three years later he received a PhD for his work in the area of mathematical crystallography. While studying and completing his doctorate he worked as a research assistant.\n\nDräger is married and has two children.\n\nIn 1996, he joined Roland Berger Strategy Consultants in Frankfurt am Main as a corporate consultant. He then returned to Hamburg in 1999 to lead the newly established Northern Institute of Technology as its CEO. The institute is one of the first public-private partnerships in the area of German higher education and is known for its interdisciplinary approach.\n\nIn 2001, Dräger was appointed senator of science and research in Hamburg's state government led by Ole von Beust, a position he held as a political independent. He called for the introduction of tuition fees and more competition among higher education institutions in order to secure the institutions' long-term funding. These recommendations were greeted with criticism, especially by student representatives.\n\nAfter early elections in 2004, Dräger was appointed senator of science and health in the second von Beust government. Continuing to advocate for reform, he succeeded in introducing tuition fees. His goal was a fundamental reform of Hamburg's university system. He promoted the establishment of new institutions and the consolidation of existing ones as a way of modernizing Hamburg's higher education structures and making them more flexible. In retrospect these measures have proven controversial: While supporters praised his expertise and determination, critics opposed cutbacks made in the humanities, among other changes. In 2008, Dräger placed last in the ranking of ministers published by the German Association of University Professors and Lecturers; one year later he again placed sixth.\n\nIn 2006, he turned over his responsibilities in the area of health to Senator Birgit Schnieber-Jastram. Following elections in 2008 he announced that he would not serve another term. His announcement was met with regret by a number of public figures, including former Hamburg Mayor Klaus von Dohnanyi, who wrote in a commentary in the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper that the city had lost presumably its \"most effective science senator since 1945.\" Other members of the media, conversely, were relieved that the \"bulldozer in the three-piece suit\" (taz) was leaving politics.\n\nIn 2008, Dräger became a member of the Bertelsmann Stiftung Executive Board, where he is responsible for the areas of education and integration. In addition, he joined Frank Ziegele as a co-executive director of the nonprofit CHE Centre for Higher Education. In both positions Dräger has advocated for a number of reforms, including more autonomous colleges and universities. He has called for providing schools in troubled neighborhoods with better equipment and resources, and ensuring that educational systems in rural areas adapt to reflect demographic change. He is in favor of all-day schools and views digital media as a helpful tool for improving education.\n\nDräger serves as the deputy chair of the Board of Trustees of the Expert Council of the German Foundations on Integration and Migration. He has called for increased immigration from non-EU countries to ensure Germany does not lose out in the international competition for skilled workers.\n\nDräger advises young entrepreneurs at the nonprofit Founders Foundation and teaches public management at the Hertie School of Governance.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15103022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15103022", "title": "Master data management", "text": "Master data management\n\nIn business, master data management (MDM) is a method used to define and manage the critical data of an organization to provide, with data integration, a single point of reference. The data that is mastered may include reference data- the set of permissible values, and the analytical data that supports decision making.\n\nIn computing, a master data management tool can be used to support master data management by removing duplicates, standardizing data (mass maintaining), and incorporating rules to eliminate incorrect data from entering the system in order to create an authoritative source of master data. Master data are the products, accounts and parties for which the business transactions are completed. The root cause problem stems from business unit and product line segmentation, in which the same customer will be serviced by different product lines, with redundant data being entered about the customer (a.k.a. party in the role of customer) and account in order to process the transaction. The redundancy of party and account data is compounded in the front to back office life cycle, where the authoritative single source for the party, account and product data is needed but is often once again redundantly entered or augmented.\n\nMaster data management has the objective of providing processes for collecting, aggregating, matching, consolidating, quality-assuring, persisting and distributing such data throughout an organization to ensure a common understanding, consistency, accuracy and control in the ongoing maintenance and application use of this information.\n\nThe term recalls the concept of a \"master file\" from an earlier computing era.\n\nMDM is a comprehensive method of enabling an enterprise to link all of its critical data to one file, called a master file, that provides a common point of reference. When properly done, master data management streamlines data sharing among personnel and departments. In addition, master data management can facilitate computing in multiple system architectures, platforms and applications.\n\nAt its core MDM can be viewed as a \"discipline for specialized quality improvement\" defined by the policies and procedures put in place by a data governance organization. The ultimate goal being to provide the end user community with a \"trusted single version of the truth\" from which to base decisions.\n\nAt a basic level, master data management seeks to ensure that an organization does not use multiple (potentially inconsistent) versions of the same master data in different parts of its operations, which can occur in large organizations. A typical example of poor master data management is the scenario of a bank at which a customer has taken out a mortgage and the bank begins to send mortgage solicitations to that customer, ignoring the fact that the person already has a mortgage account relationship with the bank. This happens because the customer information used by the marketing section within the bank lacks integration with the customer information used by the customer services section of the bank. Thus the two groups remain unaware that an existing customer is also considered a sales lead. The process of record linkage is used to associate different records that correspond to the same entity, in this case the same person.\n\nOther problems include (for example) issues with the quality of data, consistent classification and identification of data, and data-reconciliation issues. Master data management of disparate data systems requires data transformations as the data extracted from the disparate source data system is transformed and loaded into the master data management hub. To synchronize the disparate source master data, the managed master data extracted from the master data management hub is again transformed and loaded into the disparate source data system as the master data is updated. As with other Extract, Transform, Load-based data movement, these processes are expensive and inefficient to develop and to maintain which greatly reduces the return on investment for the master data management product.\n\nOne of the most common reasons some large corporations experience massive issues with master data management is growth through mergers or acquisitions. Any organizations which merge will typically create an entity with duplicate master data (since each likely had at least one master database of its own prior to the merger). Ideally, database administrators resolve this problem through deduplication of the master data as part of the merger. In practice, however, reconciling several master data systems can present difficulties because of the dependencies that existing applications have on the master databases. As a result, more often than not the two systems do not fully merge, but remain separate, with a special reconciliation process defined that ensures consistency between the data stored in the two systems. Over time, however, as further mergers and acquisitions occur, the problem multiplies, more and more master databases appear, and data-reconciliation processes become extremely complex, and consequently unmanageable and unreliable. Because of this trend, one can find organizations with 10, 15, or even as many as 100 separate, poorly integrated master databases, which can cause serious operational problems in the areas of customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, decision support, and regulatory compliance.\n\nAnother problem concerns determining the proper degree of detail and normalization to include in the master data schema. For example, in a federated HR environment, the enterprise may focus on storing people data as a current status, adding a few fields to identify date of hire, date of last promotion, etc. However this simplification can introduce business impacting errors into dependent systems for planning and forecasting. The stakeholders of such systems may be forced to build a parallel network of new interfaces to track onboarding of new hires, planned retirements, and divestment, which works against one of the aims of master data management. \n\nProcesses commonly seen in master data management include source identification, data collection, data transformation, normalization, rule administration, error detection and correction, data consolidation, data storage, data distribution, data classification, taxonomy services, item master creation, schema mapping, product codification, data enrichment and data governance.\n\nThe selection of entities considered for master data management depends somewhat on the nature of an organization. In the common case of commercial enterprises, master data management may apply to such entities as customer (customer data integration), product (product information management), employee, and vendor. Master data management processes identify the sources from which to collect descriptions of these entities. In the course of transformation and normalization, administrators adapt descriptions to conform to standard formats and data domains, making it possible to remove duplicate instances of any entity. Such processes generally result in an organizational master data management repository, from which all requests for a certain entity instance produce the same description, irrespective of the originating sources and the requesting destination.\n\nThe tools include data networks, file systems, a data warehouse, data marts, an operational data store, data mining, data analysis, data visualization, data federation and data virtualization. One of the newest tools, virtual master data management utilizes data virtualization and a persistent metadata server to implement a multi-level automated master data management hierarchy. ..\n\nThere are several ways in which master data may be collated and distributed to other systems. This includes:\n\n\n\n"}

The Ottomans themselves generally called this method \"muhasebe usulü\" (method of accounting).\n\nAbbasid accounting techniques were inherited by the Ilkhanate and then the Ottoman Empire; spanning several centuries until modern double-entry accounting was adopted post-Tanzimat.\n\nMerdiban originated in the Abbasid Caliphate; the first likely example has been found in an eighth-century government document. After the conquest of Baghdad by Mongol forces in 1258, many Persian and Arab officials were employed by the Ikhanate. As the Mongols lacked strong state institutions, local systems were adopted, including accounting techniques. For instance, the Abbasids had a kind of daily ledger called a Defter-ul Yevmiye; the Ilkhanate adopted the same kind of daily ledger but called it Ruznamce. (The later Ottoman ruznamçe was similar).\n\nGhazan (1295–1304) made fiscal reforms; these drove more detailed record-keeping and, hence, further development of accounting techniques. Centralised fiscal record-keeping was divided according to provinces, and each team reported to a \"katip\" (which roughly corresponds to \"clerk\") - the same title used in the Abbasid state. \"Katip\" continued to be used to describe Ottoman accountants, although their official title was \"halife\". The Risale-i Felekiyye, written in 1363 by Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Kiya Al-Mazandarani, was a manual of accounting, and is an important source for modern historians. The technique set out in the Risale begins to resemble a crude early attempt at double-entry accounting, but there is little evidence that this influenced the development of modern double-entry accounting in Italy.\n\nIt is possible that other states used accounting systems based on merdiban, but documentary evidence is sparse.\n\nIn the Ottoman empire, accounting was not taught systematically in madrasahs or other schools; instead, it was taught on a master-apprentice basis in the workplace, especially the Hazine-i Amire (finance ministry). So, few instruction documents survive from this era.\n\nMerdiban was named because of the descending sequence in which amounts were recorded; a total at the top, and then individual items below. Typically, the last letter of the first word in an entry would be extended all the way across a line from left to right, acting as a separator between entries.\n\nMediban was usually recorded in \"siyakat\" script; a specialised and condensed form of text, almost stenographic, which was used where much of the content was numerical. Siyakat was so widely associated with accounting and fiscal documents that it became a synonym.\n"}

He is the creator and developer of the RISE System, a decision-making process analysis system that analyses and interprets personality and behaviour. The RISE system is capable of scanning and typing the 1 million unique personality compositions, which govern a person’s decision-making processes. His first book, which outlined the basis of the system, was published in 2012.\n\nPalencsár was born in Hungary. He graduated from Szent István University in Gödöllő, Hungary. He started his career at Citibank where he developed a sales expertise. He completed his multinational career as a strategic leader at Trader Classified Media, and at the age of 28 he started his own strategic consulting firm, 3B (Personality and Behaviour Based Business). In the years since, 3B has become a key player in the business development market. Though he lives and works in various European cities for business development projects, Miklós is currently based in Budapest.\n\nPalencsár is credited with bringing business mentoring to Hungary. A Business mentor is a business development professional who combines a precise, consultancy project approach with a people-centred approach. As such, by developing the customers, a mentor is able to help them achieve their business objectives.\nMentors must not only have a background in business development consultancy but also have the skills required for coaching. In Hungary, the term is not used much in the business world, but it is more and more widespread in Western Europe. Nevertheless, there are more and more forums focusing on this topic, such as interactive discussions and conferences, and nowadays it is not unusual to come across mentors like this at successful companies. Palencsár’s mentoring practice utilises the RISE System.\n\nPalencsár used behavioural business theory to create a unique psychological system, the RISE System.RISE is the first Europe-based system primed to identify unique personal identities in the business world. RISE’s foundation has been constructed since 2000 with the support of 3B’s international consulting team. Currently, the system is capable of identifying 1 million unique personality compositions and draws from a database of over 1 million client reactions. Its methodology is unique, as the system does not try to verify an abstract psychological theory, but instead advances a theory based on business results. \n\nDue to the popularity of his business theories, Palencsár is a frequent keynote speaker at prominent business conferences and manager clubs. The Human Hungary conference series was based on 3B’s business theory. Most recently, Palencsár’s theories gave rise to the first Hungarian business developmental magazine, DECISION.\n\nPalencsár’s first book, \"3B. Behaviour Based Business\", was published in 2012 and has since garnered over 114,000 readers, making it one of the most successful business books in Hungary. Due to the positive response the book received, Palencsár released an electronic version, allowing for easy dissemination abroad. Currently, there are businessmen and businesswomen from 11 countries on 4 continents who have read the book and use the RISE System in their businesses.\n\nPalencsár’s second book, \"Personality and Behaviour Based Sales: Strategy, Management, Methodology\", was published in 2016 and focuses on personality-based sales. The book has become popular among commercial decision-makers because of its insight into the personality’s effect on the sales process.\n\nThe material of the books, which are listed under \"Modern Business Communication\" and \"Modern Business Strategy\", has become part of the curricula at renowned Hungarian educational institutions.\n\nPalencsár is associated with Hungary’s first business development magazine, a quarterly publication called DECISION. The magazine provides up-to-date information on 3B’s research, the use of the RISE System, and international strategic and trend analysis including strategy, recruitment, and generational research.\n\n\nIn 2014, Palencsár and 3B debuted the 3B Business Development software, which draws from the firm’s wealth of business development experience. Its main goal is to simplify the complex process of business development to make it more presentable to businessmen and businesswomen. The software identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the people working at a given company by identifying personality types, emphasising product development, and laying the foundations for business strategy. The software’s international distribution began at the end of 2014. 3B’s is the first software in the world which is suitable for sustained business development.\n"}

Every event that a viewer does while watching a video online can be captured and analyzed precisely.\n\nThe study of consumption patterns helps video publishers gain insights into the end-user preferences. These insights are then used to drive monetization by ad placements, and to tailor future videos to maximize viewer engagement. It aims to answer questions such as:\n\nThe following metrics are of real interest both for on-demand and live videos:\n\nAlong with other obvious dimensions (like \"Country\", \"Browser\", \"Device\" etc.), a particularly interesting dimension is \"Stream Position\" (or Video Portion). Measured as a percentage of video length, for a particular video, Plays by Stream Position indicates which portion of the video is watched how many times. It helps with analysis such as, 40% of the viewers drop off from the video after watching only 25%.\n\nVisual analysis tools integrated into online video platforms are designed to transform multiple viewing experiences into a graphic form, in order to understand the audience and optimizing video content performance.\n\nA graphical summary that helps to figure out how viewers are engaged with a specific video is called a Video Heatmap. Unlike heatmaps used in website analytics, which highlight different areas of a web page depending on the click-through rate, a video heatmap aggregates stats from every viewing session and calculates an average engagement rate (also known as watch rate ) throughout the entire video. Depending on the platform, a video hitmap can be represented in a form of a graph or a colored timeline.\n\nUser Screen contains personal information related to a specific viewer, such as location (country), IP address, operating system (OS), web browser version, first and last view dates, and average engagement. It may also include information obtained from email marketing software which is used to distribute video messages: a viewer’s email address, first and last name.\n\nLive Feed shows an overview of everyone watching the videos to the publisher in the real-time mode. The feed allows to expand detailed viewer stats or to jump to an individual user screen.\n\nThe study of online video viewer experience helps online video platforms identify shortcomings in their network infrastructure and to tweak the quality of their source content to better suit the end-users' connection speeds and devices.\n\nThis theme deals with understanding the effect of bad quality on usage.

She was a foundation employee of the US agency Doyle Dane Bernbach from 1949 and was instrumental in that agency's success and growth over the next twenty years.\n\nBorn in New York City, in 1942 Robinson earned a bachelor's degree in sociology in from Barnard College; she wanted to be a writer. She worked for the US government as a statistician during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, she moved to Boston, and embarked on a career in advertising. After starting out at Bresnick & Solomont, she joined Grey Advertising in 1947 writing fashion promotion, where she first worked for William Bernbach. When he and Ned Doyle left Grey in 1949 to start their eponymous agency with Mac Dane their \"little gold mine of people,\" included Robinson and the art director Bob Gage with whom she was teamed and would enjoy much creative success.\n\nRobinson was Doyle Dane Bernbach's first chief copywriter. At DDB, she supervised a team that would produce a number of notable people in advertising, including Mary Wells Lawrence and Paula Green. Wells described Robinson's place at DDB when Wells arrived there in 1957 \"By the time I arrived the gods were firmly ensconced, the pantheon was established, the rituals, the sacred writings were already beloved. The Dei Majores were the originals, Bill, Ned, Mac, Phyllis and Bob Gage; they spoke a secret language. There were talented others, the spirits and the elves, but the gods were the gods, everyone in the industry knew who was who\". Years later Wells put it more simply, \"I would buy a used car from Phyllis Robinson.\"\n\nRobinson worked on memorable campaigns for numerous clients, including Ohrbach's, Henry S. Levy and Sons – \"You don't have to be Jewish to love Levy's Real Jewish Rye\", El Al Airlines, and Polaroid with a long running campaign featuring actors James Garner and Mariette Hartley. On the occasion of her death Keith Reinhard, Chairman-Emeritus of DDB Worldwide wrote \"\"In presentations to students, I still use her campaigns for Levy's rye bread and Ohrbach's as timeless examples of how to make brands famous by writing in a conversational tone... [The Ohrbach's ad] is great on its own merits, but the more important reason I singled it out was that, when Volkswagen decided to introduce the Beetle to the U.S. market, they did not conduct an agency search. Instead, they simply said, \"We want the agency that does Ohrbach's\" – and thus, thanks to Phyllis, the creative revolution was born.\"\" \n\nLater, she also worked in theater, co-writing the lyrics for \"Cry for Us All\". She also wrote the books, lyrics, and music for a 1995 musical based on Bernard Malamud's short story \"Angel Levine\".\n\nIn 1944 she married Dr. Richard G. Robinson, who died in 2005. They had a daughter Nancy. Robinson quit full-time work at DDB in 1962 to raise her daughter, but continued to consult to the agency working three days a week through to 1968. She was 89 when she died in Manhattan.\n\nRobinson was inducted into the Creative Hall of Fame in 1968. For a time she served as chairperson for the Creative Hall of Fame. In 1999, \"Advertising Age\" magazine named her one of the 100 most influential figures in the history of advertising.\n\nShe was featured in the 2009 documentary film \"Art & Copy\".\n\nOn International Women's Day in 2017, DDB Worldwide changed its name temporarily to DDB&R to honor Robinson.\n"}

One common reason is to discount damaged goods. Another is employee discount and discounts given to other groups. An override may also be necessary due to the displayed price of an item not matching the price shown at the register. This can occur when staff have not caught up with changes to the display caused by recent price changes on the retail management system, or it may simply be a mistake. The customer is then given the old price for goodwill, or for legal reasons. Other reasons include coupon redemption and items on sale.\n\nPrice overrides can present an opportunity for employee fraud. Unauthorised large discounts can be given to associates of the employee. Alternatively, an employee can make the sale at the full price, then, after serving the customer, void the sale and enter it again, but this time with a discount which the employee pockets. For these reasons the ability to override prices is often limited to senior employees only, or alternatively, junior employees have a limit placed on the amount they can override, typically 10%. This can be further refined by the retail management system distinguishing between the various types of transactions and setting appropriate limits and controls for each individually.\n"}

Anand Mahindra is the Chairman of Tech Mahindra, which is headquartered at Pune and has its registered office in Mumbai.\n\nPart of the Mahindra Group, Tech Mahindra is a 4.7 billion company with over 113,550 employees across 90 countries. Tech Mahindra was ranked #5 in India's software services (IT) firms and overall #111 in Fortune India 500 list for 2012. Tech Mahindra, on 25 June 2013, announced the completion of a merger with Mahindra Satyam.\n\nTech Mahindra has 926 active clients as of March 2018.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra started a joint venture with British Telecom in 1986 as a technology outsourcing firm. British Telecom initially had around 30 percent stake in the Tech Mahindra company. In December 2010, British Telecom sold 5.5 per cent of its stake in Tech Mahindra to Mahindra & Mahindra for Rs 451 crore. In August 2012, British Telecom sold 14.1 per cent of its stake to institutional investors for about Rs 1,395 crore. In December 2012, British Telecom sold its remaining 9.1 per cent (11.6 million shares) shareholding to institutional investors for a total gross cash proceeds of Rs 1,011.4 crore. This sale marked the exit of British Telecom from Tech Mahindra.\n\nAfter the Satyam scandal of 2008-09 Tech Mahindra bid for Satyam Computer Services, and emerged as a top bidder with an offer of Rs 58.90 a share for a 31 per cent stake in the company, beating a strong rival Larsen & Toubro. After evaluating the bids, the government-appointed board of Satyam Computer announced on 13 April 2009: \"its Board of Directors has selected Venturbay Consultants Private Limited, a subsidiary controlled by Tech Mahindra Limited as the highest bidder to acquire a controlling stake in the Company, subject to the approval of the Hon'ble Company Law Board.\" Through a subsidiary, it has emerged victorious in Satyam sell-off, a company probably two times its size in number of people. This was one of the largest merger deals in India's tech industry.\n\nTech Mahindra announced its merger with Mahindra Satyam on March 21, 2012, after the boards of the two companies gave their approval, to create a 2.5 billion $ IT Company The two firms had received the go-ahead for the merger from the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange. On June 11, 2013, Andhra Pradesh High Court gave its approval for the merger of Mahindra Satyam with Tech Mahindra, after the Bombay high court had already given its approval. Vineet Nayyar said that technical approvals from the Registrar of Companies in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra are required which will be done in two to four weeks, and within eight weeks, the new merged entity would be in place. The new organisation would be led by Anand Mahindra as Chairman, Vineet Nayyar as Vice Chairman and C. P. Gurnani as the CEO and Managing Director. On June 25, 2013, Tech Mahindra announced the completion of its merger with Mahindra Satyam to create the nation's fifth largest software services company with a turnover of USD 2.7 billion. Tech Mahindra got the approval from the registrar of companies for the merger at 11:45 pm on June 24, 2013. July 5, 2013 has been determined as record date on which the Satyam Computer Services ('Mahindra Satyam') shares will be swapped for Tech Mahindra shares under the approved scheme. Mahindra Satyam (Satyam Computer Services), was suspended from trading with effect from July 4, 2013, following the merger. Tech Mahindra completed share swap and allocated its shares to the shareholders of Satyam Computer Services on July 12, 2013. The stock exchanges have accorded their approval for trading the new shares effective July 12, 2013. Tech Mahindra posted net profit of Rs 686 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2013, up 27% compared to the corresponding quarter last year. By March 2016, Tech Mahindra's post-tax earnings had surged past that of M&M.\n\n\nTech Mahindra has offices in more than 60 countries.\n\n\n"}

Due to the harm done to the animal subjects, this testing is opposed by animal rights activists and others. Cosmetic animal testing is banned in the European Union, India, Israel, and Norway.\n\nUsing animal testing in the development of cosmetics may involve testing either a finished product or the individual ingredients of a finished product on animals, often rabbits, as well as mice, rats, and other animals. Cosmetics can be defined as products applied to the body in various ways in order to enhance the body's appearance or to cleanse the body. This includes all hair products, makeup, nail products and soaps.\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to endorse animal testing methods.\n\nRe-using existing test data obtained from previous animal testing is generally not considered to be cosmetic testing on animals; however, the acceptability of this to opponents of testing is inversely proportional to how recent the data is.\n\nMethods of testing cosmetics on animals include many different tests that are categorized differently based on which areas the cosmetics will be used for. One new ingredient in any cosmetic product used in these tests could lead to the deaths of at least 1,400 animals \n\nDermal penetration: Rats are mostly used in this method that analyzes moment of a chemical, and the penetration of the chemical in the bloodstream. Dermal penetration is a method that creates a better understanding of skin absorption.\n\nSkin sensitisation: This is a method that determines if a chemical causes an allergic reaction. The chemical adjuvant is injected to boost the immune system. In the past it was performed on guinea pigs, and applied on a shaved patch of skin. Substances are assessed based on appearance of skin.\n\nAcute toxicity: This test is used to determine danger of exposure to a chemical by mouth, skin, or inflammation. Rats and mice are injected in lethal dose 50% (LD50). This test can cause animal convulsions, loss of motor function, and seizures.\n\nDraize test: This is a method of testing that may cause irritation or corrosion to the skin or eye on animals, dermal sensitization, airway sensitization, endocrine disruption, and (which refers to the lethal dose which kills 50% of the treated animals).\n\nSkin corrosivity or irritation: This method of test assesses the potential of a substance causing irreversible damage to the skin. It is typically performed on rabbits and involves putting chemicals on a shaved patch of skin. This determines the level of damage to the skin that includes itching, inflammation, swelling, etc.\n\nCosmetics manufacturers who do not test on animals may now use \"in vitro\" screens to test for endpoints which can determine potential risk to humans with a very high sensitivity and specificity. Companies such as CeeTox in the USA, recently acquired by Cyprotex, specialize in such testing and organizations like the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), PETA and many other organizations advocate the use of \"in vitro\" and other non-animal tests in the development of consumer products. By using safe ingredients from a list of 5,000 which have already been tested in conjunction with modern methods of cosmetics testing, the need for tests using animals are negated.\n\nEpiSkin™, EpiDerm™ and SkinEthic are each composed of artificial human skin as an option for alternative testing. Artificial skin can imitate the reaction actual human skin will have to a product and the chemicals it contains and can be altered to mimic different skin types and ages. For example, using UV light on EpiSkin can cause it to resemble older skin and adding melanocytes will turn the skin a darker color. This helped create a spectrum of different skin colors that are then used to compare the results of sunblock on a different variety of people. To address potential issues with other parts of the human body, research companies such as NOTOX have developed a synthetic model of the human liver, which is the main organ to detox the body, in order to test harmful ingredients and chemicals to see if the liver can detox those elements. Research companies can also use body parts and organs taken from animals slaughtered for the meat industry to perform tests such as the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Test and Isolated Chicken Eye Test.\n\nIn 1937, a mistake was made that ended up changing the pharmaceutical industry drastically. A company created a medicine “to treat streptococcal infections”, and without any scientific research the medicine was out on shelves. This medicine turned out to be extremely poisonous to people, leading to large poisoning outbreaks followed by over 100 deaths. This epidemic led to a law being passed in 1938, called the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, enforcing more rigorous guidelines on cosmetic products. After this law was passed companies looked to animals to test their products, in turn, creating the first encounters of cosmetic animal testing.\n\n\nThere is a strategy used in animal testing laboratories titled the 'Three R's:' Reduction, refinement, and replacement' (Doke, \"Alternatives to Animal Testing: A Review\"). \n\nDue to the strong public backlash against cosmetic testing on animals, most cosmetic manufacturers say their products are not tested on animals. However, they are still required by trading standards and consumer protection laws in most countries to show their products are not toxic and not dangerous to public health, and that the ingredients are not dangerous in large quantities, such as when in transport or in the manufacturing plant. In some countries, it is possible to meet these requirements without any further tests on animals. In other countries, it may require animal testing to meet legal requirements. The United States and Japan are frequently criticized for their insistence on stringent safety measures, which often requires animal testing.\nSome retailers distinguish themselves in the marketplace by their stance on animal testing.\n\nAlthough Japanese law doesn’t require non-medicated cosmetics to be tested on animals, it doesn’t prohibit it either, leaving the decision to individual companies. Animal testing is required mainly when the product contains newly-developed tar colors, ultraviolet ray protective ingredients or preservatives, and when the amount of any ingredient regulated in terms of how much can be added is increased.\n\nJapanese Brands such as Shiseido and Mandom have ended much, but not all, of their animal testing. However, most other leading cosmetics companies in Japan still test on animals.\n\nSão Paulo in Brazil, banned cosmetic animal testing in 2014.\n\nThe European Union (EU) followed suit, after it agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009, and to ban cosmetics-related animal testing. Animal testing is regulated in EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics. Imported cosmetics ingredients tested on animals were phased out for EU consumer markets in 2013 by the ban, but can still be sold to outside of the EU. Norway banned cosmetics animal testing the same time as the EU. In May 2018 the European Parliament voted for the EU and its Member States to work towards a UN convention against the use of animal testing for cosmetics.\n\nIn early 2014, India announced a ban on testing cosmetics on animals in the country, thereby becoming the second country in Asia to do so. Later India banned import of cosmetics tested on animals in November 2014.\n\nIsrael banned \"the import and marketing of cosmetics, toiletries or detergents that were tested on animals\" in 2013.\n\nIn 2015, New Zealand also banned animal testing.\n\nTurkey \"banned any animal testing for cosmetic products that have already been introduced to the market.\" \n\nAnimal testing on cosmetics or their ingredients was banned in the UK in 1998.\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is potentially \"making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals.\"\n\nIn Australia, the \"End Cruel Cosmetics Bill\" was introduced to Parliament in March 2014, which would ban local testing, which generally doesn't happen there, and importation of cosmetics tested on animals. In 2016 a bill was passed to ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals, which will come into effect in July 2017.\n\nBrazil's legislation will vote on a nationwide animal testing for cosmetics ban by the end of March 2014.\n\nIn March 2014, the \"Humane Cosmetics Act\" was introduced to the U.S. congress which would ban cosmetic testing on animals and eventually would ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals. The bill did not advance.\n\nSouth Korea is also potentially \"making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals.\"\n\nIn 2015, Taiwan launched a bill proposing a ban on cosmetic testing on animals. It passed in 2016 and goes into effect in 2019.\n\nChina passed a law on 30 June 2014 to eliminate the requirement for animal testing of cosmetics. Though domestically-produced ordinary cosmetic goods do not require testing, animal testing is still mandated by law for Chinese-made \"cosmeceuticals\" (cosmetic goods which make a functional claim) which are available for sale in China. Cosmetics intended solely for export are exempt from the animal testing requirement.\n\nIn 2013, the Russian Ministry of Health stated \"Toxicological testing is performed by means of testing for skin allergic reaction or test on\nmucous tissue/eye area (with use of lab animals) or by use of alternative general toxicology methods (IN VITRO). In this manner the technical regulations include measures which provide an alternative to animal testing\".\n\n"}
{"id": "29789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29789", "title": "Tourism", "text": "Tourism\n\nTourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours. Tourism may be international, or within the traveller's country. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go \"beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only\", as people \"traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes\".\n\nTourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the economy of both the source and host countries, in some cases being of vital importance.\n\nTourism suffered as a result of a strong economic slowdown of the late-2000s recession, between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, but slowly recovered. International tourism receipts (the travel item in the balance of payments) grew to trillion ( billion) in 2011, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012, emerging markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade. The ITB Berlin is the world's leading tourism trade fair. Global tourism accounts for ca. 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe word \"tourist\" was used in 1772 and \"tourism\" in 1811. It is formed from the word \"tour\", which is derived from Old English \"turian\", from Old French \"torner\", from Latin \"tornare\"; 'to turn on a lathe,' which is itself from Ancient Greek \"tornos\" (τόρνος); 'lathe'.\n\nTourism has become an important, even vital, source of income for many regions and even entire countries. The \"Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980\" recognized its importance as \"an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations.\"\n\nTourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists, accounting for 30% of the world's trade in services, and for 6% of overall exports of goods and services. It also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism.\n\nThe hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services (such as airlines, cruise ships, trains and taxicabs); hospitality services (such as accommodations, including hotels and resorts); and entertainment venues (such as amusement parks, restaurants, casinos, shopping malls, music venues, and theaters). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including souvenirs.\n\nOn the flip-side, tourism can degrade people and sour relationships between host and guest.\n\nIn 1936, the League of Nations defined a \"foreign tourist\" as \"someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours\". Its successor, the United Nations, amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.\n\nIn 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as \"the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity.\" In 1976, the Tourism Society of England's definition was: \"Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes.\" In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.\n\nIn 1994, the United Nations identified three forms of tourism in its \"Recommendations on Tourism Statistics\":\n\nThe terms \"tourism\" and \"travel\" are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism, but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms \"tourism\" and \"tourist\" are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, \"traveler\" is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.\n\nInternational tourist arrivals reached 1.035 billion in 2012, up from over 996 million in 2011, and 952 million in 2010. In 2011 and 2012, international travel demand continued to recover from the losses resulting from the late-2000s recession, where tourism suffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. After a 5% increase in the first half of 2008, growth in international tourist arrivals moved into negative territory in the second half of 2008, and ended up only 2% for the year, compared to a 7% increase in 2007. The negative trend intensified during 2009, exacerbated in some countries due to the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in a worldwide decline of 4.2% in 2009 to 880 million international tourists arrivals, and a 5.7% decline in international tourism receipts.\n\nThe World Tourism Organization reports the following ten destinations as the most visited in terms of the number of international travelers in 2017.\n\nInternational tourism receipts grew to US$1,260 billion in 2015, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 4.4% from 2014. The World Tourism Organization reports the following entities as the top ten tourism earners for the year 2015:\n\nThe World Tourism Organization reports the following countries as the ten biggest spenders on international tourism for the year 2015.\n\nBased upon air traffic, the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index rates the following as the world's ten most popular cities for international tourism.\n\nMasterCard rates the following cities as the world's ten biggest earners from international tourism in 2015.\n\nEuromonitor International rated these the world's cities most visited by international tourists in January 2015:\n\nTravel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times traveled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, learn new languages, experience new cultures, and to taste different cuisines. As early as Shulgi, however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travelers. Travelling for pleasure can be seen in Egypt as early on as 1500 B.C. During the Roman Republic, spas and coastal resorts such as Baiae were popular among the rich. Pausanias wrote his \"Description of Greece\" in the 2nd century AD. In ancient China, nobles sometimes made a point of visiting Mount Tai and, on occasion, all five Sacred Mountains.\n\nBy the Middle Ages, Christianity and Buddhism had traditions of pilgrimage. Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Wu Cheng'en's \"Journey to the West\" remain classics of English and Chinese literature.\n\nThe 10th- to 13th-century Song dynasty also saw secular travel writers such as Su Shi (11th century) and Fan Chengda (12th century) become popular in China. Under the Ming, Xu Xiake continued the practice. In medieval Italy, Francesco Petrarch also wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of Mount Ventoux that praised the act of traveling and criticized \"frigida incuriositas\" (\"cold lack of curiosity\"). The Burgundian poet later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the Jura Mountains.\n\nModern tourism can be traced to what was known as the Grand Tour, which was a traditional trip around Europe (especially Germany and Italy), undertaken by mainly upper-class European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. In 1624, young Prince of Poland, Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa, the eldest son and heir of Sigismund III, embarked for a journey across Europe, as was in custom among Polish nobility. He travelled through territories of today's Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, where he admired the Siege of Breda by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic. It was an educational journey and one of the outcomes was introduction of Italian opera in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transit in the 1840s, and generally followed a standard itinerary. It was an educational opportunity and rite of passage. Though primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of Protestant Northern European nations on the Continent, and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier, and Thomas Cook made the \"Cook's Tour\" a byword.\n\nThe Grand Tour became a real status symbol for upper class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers and travellers (such as Goethe) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centres, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.\n\n\"The New York Times\" recently described the Grand Tour in this way:\n\nThe primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.\n\nLeisure travel was associated with the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdomthe first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population. Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, factory owners and traders. These comprised the new middle class. Cox & Kings was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758.\n\nThe British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In Nice, France, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the French Riviera, the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the \"Promenade des Anglais\"; in many other historic resorts in continental Europe, old, well-established palace hotels have names like the \"Hotel Bristol\", \"Hotel Carlton\", or \"Hotel Majestic\"reflecting the dominance of English customers.\n\nA pioneer of the travel agency business, Thomas Cook's idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at Kibworth. With the opening of the extended Midland Counties Railway, he arranged to take a group of 540 temperance campaigners from Leicester Campbell Street station to a rally in Loughborough, away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person; this included rail tickets and food for the journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price. This was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains. During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and Sunday school children. In 1844 the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him, provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway fares.\n\nIn 1855, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to Calais to coincide with the Paris Exhibition. The following year he started his \"grand circular tours\" of Europe. During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt and the United States. Cook established \"inclusive independent travel\", whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel, food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.\n\nCruising is a popular form of water tourism.\nLeisure cruise ships were introduced by the \"Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company\" (P&O) in 1844, sailing from Southampton to destinations such as Gibraltar, Malta and Athens. In 1891, German businessman Albert Ballin sailed the ship \"Augusta Victoria\" from Hamburg into the Mediterranean Sea. June 29, 1900 saw the launching of the first purpose-built cruise ship was \"Prinzessin Victoria Luise\", built in Hamburg for the Hamburg America Line.\n\nMany leisure-oriented tourists travel to seaside resorts on their nearest coast or further afield. Coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter.\n\nAcademics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre-scheduled tours, usually under the organization of tourism professionals. This form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the United Kingdom and was pioneered by Thomas Cook. Cook took advantage of Europe's rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to the masses, in addition to longer holidays to Continental Europe, India, Asia and the Western Hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers. By the 1890s over 20,000 tourists per year used Thomas Cook & Son.\n\nThe relationship between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads. One contemporary form of mass tourism, package tourism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.\n\nTravel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes.\nImprovements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest, so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.\n\nIn Continental Europe, early seaside resorts included: Heiligendamm, founded in 1793 at the Baltic Sea, being the first seaside resort; Ostend, popularised by the people of Brussels; Boulogne-sur-Mer and Deauville for the Parisians; Taormina in Sicily. In the United States, the first seaside resorts in the European style were at Atlantic City, New Jersey and Long Island, New York.\n\nBy the mid-20th century the Mediterranean Coast became the principal mass tourism destination. The 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the Spanish economic \"miracle\".\n\nNiche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics. Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:\n\nOther terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term \"destination\" in the descriptions, such as destination weddings, and terms such as location vacation.\n\nSt. Moritz, Switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s: hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend. It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.\n\nMajor ski resorts are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. Andorra, Austria, Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Sweden, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey), Canada, the United States (e.g. Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York) Argentina, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Chile, and Lebanon.\n\nSome places that already have ski opportunities can also have glaciers in the area. Some of theses places already offer a glacier hike to see the glaciers in another way that they can. One of these places are New Zealand. New Zealand has several glaciers that are available for this experience. The Franz Josef is one of these glaciers that tourism is available. The only way to get to the glacier is via a helicopter. Before helicopters were invented the way that people were able to get up to the glacier was by hiking up to the glacier. The companies have to make sure that people are safe from when they are on the glacier. This would fall under environmental tourism as well as winter tourism.\n\nThere has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades, especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialised holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or niche market-targeted destination hotels.\n\nThe developments in air transport infrastructure, such as jumbo jets, low-cost airlines, and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable. The WHO estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time. There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example some retirement-age people sustain year round tourism. This is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging, in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.\n\nThere have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the September 11 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations, such as in Bali and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a tsunami, caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, hit the Asian countries on the Indian Ocean, including the Maldives. Thousands of lives were lost including many tourists. This, together with the vast clean-up operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.\n\nIndividual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like CouchSurfing and airbnb being established. There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in Dubai.\n\n\"Sustainable tourism is envisaged as leading to management of all resources in such a way that economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecological processes, biological diversity and life support systems.\" (World Tourism Organization)\n\nSustainable development implies \"meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987)\n\nAn important part of sustainable tourism is something known as the three pillars of sustainability which include Economic, Environmental/Ecological and Socio-cultural. For a destination to be truly sustainable it must have an equal balance which the three pillars. Economic is in relation to money and making and maintaining a certain amount of cash. Environmental is of course in relation to the environment it looks into whether the local ecosystems can support the influx of visitors and also how these visitors effect the ecosystem. Then finally Socio-cultural is about how well the culture of this area is able to maintain its traditions with the incoming tourists. These pillars are important because they are the true key to being sustainable when discussing tourism.\n\nSustainable tourism can be seen as having regard to ecological and social-cultural carrying capacities and includes involving the community of the destination in tourism development planning (that was done e.g. in Fruška Gora National Park in Serbia). It also involves integrating tourism to match current economic and growth policies so as to mitigate some of the negative economic and social impacts of 'mass tourism'. Murphy (1985) advocates the use of an 'ecological approach', to consider both 'plants' and 'people' when implementing the sustainable tourism development process. This is in contrast to the 'boosterism' and 'economic' approaches to tourism planning, neither of which consider the detrimental ecological or sociological impacts of tourism development to a destination.\n\nHowever, Butler questions the exposition of the term 'sustainable' in the context of tourism, citing its ambiguity and stating that \"the emerging sustainable development philosophy of the 1990s can be viewed as an extension of the broader realization that a preoccupation with economic growth without regard to its social and environmental consequences is self-defeating in the long term.\" Thus 'sustainable tourism development' is seldom considered as an autonomous function of economic regeneration as separate from general economic growth.\n\nEcotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveler; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities; and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights.\"Take only memories and leave only footprints\" is a very common slogan in protected areas. Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.\n\nThe movie tourism is a form of tourism for those who visit the film and television locations, ie the places used for filming a film or a television series. In addition to organized tours (and not) to film locations lately has widened the tendency to a type of tourism, linked to the cinema, which relates to events, conventions and more like the case of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico.\n\nThe Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is an artistic costume movement originally born as a journalistic column on various online and paper publications officially in 2012 (with a genesis formed in the previous decade) but, in the following years, it has become a real costume fashion popularized in sites, associations, institutions, municipal administrations, political parties, movements and television listings all over the world. It also includes Museums and Sports Groups linked to its brand. The purpose of the work is varied: from the redevelopment of territorial areas thanks to the artistic interest raised to be film and fiction locations (Movie tourism) to promote events linked to the Cinema as film anniversaries, festivals, parties to theme (Toga Party, Monster Party, Cosplay Party, Hollywood Party, Pajamas Party, etc ...), manifestations born in films or that the cinema has helped to divulge (though already existing) as, for example, the Demolition Derby, village festivals disseminated by the Cinema (such as those appearing in the Mondo Cane film series, etc ...). We wanted to differentiate from Movie Tourism (a fashion that has existed for several decades) to be more varied and not limited to tourism (that is a part of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico).\nIn the mid-2000s, the student of video advertising and journalistic communications at the Turin branch of the Fellini Institute Davide Lingua (called Dave Lingua), obsessed with customary phenomena, has in mind to create a totally new object to redevelop areas territories hit by the crisis but fun and that leads to fashion accessible to all. This is the genesis for the creation of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico. A few years later (between 2010, the beginning of the collaboration, and 2012) creates with this name a column (which initially deals with Cine tourism, Cinema Museums and Costume Party with a cinematic theme) within the site (in that period related to the homonymous paper magazine) of the Milan group Mondadori filmtv.it which soon became the most popular of the magazine with a myriad of collaborators. In the following period the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico appears as a column in various newspapers and magazines (the Netweek group, La Voce, is mentioned in La Stampa and many other newspapers) and officially appears as a cultural movement that gives full freedom to all to join simply using the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico (respecting however the topics of interest of the movement) coming to create totally independent sections (but always within legally registered bodies or associations), with their own statutes and directives but with only provided that the official founder (helped at the beginning by the first members) Davide Lingua is recognized as Permanent Director for life (in fact director and not president because he wants to underline the journalistic origin of the project).\n\nFrom its birth until today the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is a worldwide journalistic column, television broadcasting, has sections in many associations, institutions that collaborate with municipal administrations, has dealt with the official celebrations of film shooting anniversaries (for example Salasco of the film Bitter Rice), appears in the credits of many films for the collaboration given, organizes communication courses, cultural and sporting events, etc ...\n\nVolunteer tourism (or voluntourism) is growing as a largely Western phenomenon, with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities. Wearing (2001) defines volunteer tourism as applying “to those tourists who, for various reasons, volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society”. VSO was founded in the UK in 1958 and the US Peace Corps was subsequently founded in 1960. These were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations, initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries, which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism.\n\nThis form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel, with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures, and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism. However, increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour, and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives, while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist. Increasingly organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community-centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people.\n\nPro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the Overseas Development Institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in Tanzania and cultural tourism in Luang Prabang, Laos. There is also the possibility of pro-poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world.\n\nRecession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place of once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travelers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation.\n\nWhen there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in Southeast Asia, India, Eastern Europe, Cuba and Canada where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. dentistry), traveling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as \"medical tourism\".\n\nEducational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of classroom environment. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program.\n\nThis type of tourism is focused tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the city/region. This type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience. Creating a sustainable atmosphere it creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices. An example of event tourism would be the music festival South by Southwest that is hosted in Austin, Texas annually. This is a perfect example because very year people from all over the world flock to this one city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see a whole city of bands perform. These people are being drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which is exactly what event tourism is about.\n\nCreative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism, since the early beginnings of tourism itself. Its European roots date back to the time of the Grand Tour, which saw the sons of aristocratic families traveling for the purpose of mostly interactive, educational experiences. More recently, creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards, who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS), have directed a number of projects for the European Commission, including cultural and crafts tourism, known as sustainable tourism. They have defined \"creative tourism\" as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community, through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences.\n\nMeanwhile, the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as UNESCO, who through the Creative Cities Network, have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged, authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place.\nMore recently, creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism, drawing on active participation by travelers in the culture of the host communities they visit. Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development, including the United Kingdom, Austria, France, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Spain, Italy, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nThe growing interest of tourists in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers, attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism, highlighting the intangible heritage (craft workshops, cooking classes, etc.) and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure (for example, through the rent of halls and auditorium).\n\nExperiential travel (or \"immersion travel\") is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its history, people, food and culture.\n\nThe term “Experiential travel” is already mentioned in publications from 1985 – however it was discovered as a meaningful market trend much later.\n\nOne emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley (2000) as \"dark\" tourism. This type of tourism involves visits to \"dark\" sites, such as battlegrounds, scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide, for example concentration camps. Its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs.\n\nPhilip Stone argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining one's own death through the real death of others. Erik H Cohen introduces the term \"populo sites\" to evidence the educational character of dark tourism. Populo sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors. Based on a study at Yad Vashem, the Shoah (Holocaust) memorial museum in Jerusalem, a new term—\"in populo\"—is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell. Learning about the Shoah in Jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in Europe, but equally authentic. It is argued that a dichotomy between \"authentic\" sites at the location of a tragedy and \"created\" sites elsewhere is insufficient. Participants' evaluations of seminars for European teachers at Yad Vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject. Implications for other cases of dark tourism at \"in populo\" locations are discussed. In this vein, Peter Tarlow defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths, which continue to impact our lives. This issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma.\n\nSocial tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation. It includes youth hostels and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations, trade unions, or in Communist times publicly owned enterprises. In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria, Walter Hunziker proposed the following definition: \"Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services\".\n\nAlso known as \"Tourism of Doom,\" or \"Last Chance Tourism\" this emerging trend involves traveling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of Mount Kilimanjaro, the melting glaciers of Patagonia, or the coral of the Great Barrier Reef) before it is too late. Identified by travel trade magazine Travel Age West editor-in-chief Kenneth Shapiro in 2007 and later explored in \"The New York Times\", this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise. Some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming, overpopulation or climate change. Others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual’s carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing.\n\nReligious tourism, in particular religious travel, is used to strengthen faith and show devotion both of which are central tenets of many major religions. Religious tourists seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their self-identity in a positive manner. Given this, the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious self-identity or not.\n\nThe World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4%. With the advent of e-commerce, tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet. Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly. This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.\n\nIt has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context. Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies. This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future.\n\nThere has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism, with only the Russian Space Agency providing transport to date. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion-dollar market by 2030.\n\nSince the late 1980s, sports tourism has become increasingly popular. Events such as rugby, Olympics, Commonwealth games, Asian Games and football World Cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights, hotels and excursions.\nAs a result of the late-2000s recession, international arrivals suffered a strong slowdown beginning in June 2008. Growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7% during the first eight months of 2008. This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry, with a negative growth in September 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through September. The hotel industry also reported a slowdown, with room occupancy declining. In 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8%. By the first quarter of 2009, real travel demand in the United States had fallen 6% over six quarters. While this is considerably milder than what occurred after the 9/11 attacks, the decline was at twice the rate as real GDP has fallen.\n\nHowever, evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term. It has been suggested that travel is necessary in order to maintain relationships, as social life is increasingly networked and conducted at a distance. For many people vacations and travel are increasingly being viewed as a necessity rather than a luxury, and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some 6.6% globally over 2009, with growth up to 8% in emerging economies.\n\n\n"}
